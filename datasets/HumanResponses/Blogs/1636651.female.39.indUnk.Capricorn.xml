      Well, the time is almost here.  9:31pm tomorrow night, I will be getting off a plane in Atlanta to finally meet him in person.  He has called me every night the past 5 nights, (he did miss Saturday, but that was because he fell asleep, and we chatted on the internet so that counts) we have talked about what we will do while I am there and how nervous I am.  Yes, I am nervous and the more I think about it the worse it is.  I have an upset tummy, a headache and I can't concentrate.  Last night he and I talked and after we hung up, I laid there.  Staring at the ceiling, I dozed off and on, but I kept looking at the freaking clock.  I have never done anything like this before, believe it or not, and you wouldn't believe the thoughts that go though your mind.(Will it? What if? Will I? Will He?)   urlLink J  says I should take a Dramamine and wash it down with a shot of Vodka, yes, that will make me relaxed, but I don't want to fall into the guys arms and pass out...not good!  I know I will be fine....as soon as I see him...as soon as I touch him....as soon as I......

      The curious ones want to know. What makes me tick? You probably still won't know after reading my  urlLink 100+ Things about me . That's ok, don't matter.   It's an ever-changing world and I am ever-changing too.

      I'm a Strawberry Daiquiri. I'm the person that everyone just wants to have sex with.  Nothing more, nothing less.    urlLink Discover your alcoholic personality!   Yuck, I don't even like Strawberry Daiquiri's....I like frozen "Sex on the beach", and not from New Orleans Daiquiri's...only from Bayou Daiquiri's, on Veterans, during Mardi Gras...and the owner of the shop ain't that bad either...heheeee!

      A weekend is definately not boring, especially when you hang out with  urlLink J .   After the VFW on Friday, I hit Legends to meet up with J....more dancing...always dancing, ok, and people watching too.  The band was sucking big time with it's "YMCA, Disco, Rap, Crap", so J talked me into checking out the FQ, just to make sure none of the Bike's were there.  Disappointing, nobody we knew was hanging at Johnnie's and a stroll down Bourbon only introduced us to a plastic Barbie Doll crowd at the Zoo and drunken tourists trying to remember where they parked their cars and leaning on each other as they find their way. Enough! Back to Legends and the bands next set was better, Rock On!, actually got on the floor and swayed to the music.    Saturday I had to work for a few hours, but got that done and picked up J for a road-trip to Biloxi.  J was feeling the need to have  urlLink Master Tom  touch her, Mmmmm.  (I was in the mood too, but his time was limited. When I get him, I do not want him distracted, if ya know what I mean...heeheeeee.  I did go over a couple pictures and an idea, he is going to draw something up for me, more Tats, yes, Yes, YES!!!!)  J, after a little over 2 hours, is done for this session.  Tom says it could take up to 18 hours for her to be finished, it is beautiful now, I can hardly wait for it to be colored.   All bandaged up, a little food in the tummies and an hour and a half on the road and we are back at the dancefloor.  Ohhh No, another "Crap" Band, Help me!, "The Killer Beans" were better than this.  We decide to sit outside for awhile to see if they would get better, or wait for the "on break music".  I went inside for a minute and when I came out, there was this guy in my seat talking to J.  I walked to the table and told him he stole my seat, as I pulled up another and sat.  He mumbled on and then asks J, "Who is this? Your Mother?"  My first instinct was to jump over the table and slap him.  Instead I said, "Fuck you, asshole!"  He looked hurt, unbelievable!...he then tries to fix it and asks if I was her sister...No, No little boy, no fixin that. His friends drag him off and I figure that was the end of that, thank goodness.  But no, it's not, he comes back, and after he realizes J is not interested, he starts to hit on me.  Asking me questions, stupid questions and repeating the stupid questions.  I am so rude to him, and trashing him so bad, he is eating it up.  He walks away and then comes back.  This guy was so out of it, he just didn't get it.  J sees my dilema and drags me inside to dance.  The guy follows, I leave the dance floor, he follows again, back on the floor and he is behind me, I cannot shake this guy.  Finally I hid in the bar, behind this really big guy, and he lost me, got distracted and found someone else to hit on.  Sorry girl, but Thank you! It's about 1:30 and J is having trouble with her back, so we are standing there watching the people on the floor.  On one side you have the Melon Girls, in their Lime Green shirts with Big Red Lips on the right tit, on the other side you have the group of friends, that includes the kid that hit on me, that do the round table with each other and it doesn't matter which sex you are(They reminded me of that Vampire movie with George Clooney, Raw, hardcore, at a price), then in the middle you had the retired Disco Break-dancer, in his Blue Spandex shirt doing a dance off with the Black Gentle-Something who's wearing the burlap shirt.  J voices that she thinks the circus is in town and all we need is a midget being shot out of a cannon.  The crowd parts and out walk two "little women".  Hand over mouth it was mutually decided to go home. Two things to be said..... 1) Always bust the balls of a 26 year old, who is proud to be called Junebug, that lives on the Westbank, gets his nasty-ass tats on the Westbank, looks like your daughter's ex-boyfriend and asks if you are your friend's Mother. and 2) Leave the dance floor when the circus is in town.

      My Momma was out of town this past weekend, so I had to run the Bar.  Whooo hooo, another Friday night at the VFW Post.  The usual guys showed up, Lenny, Lionel, Popcorn, Wayne and Bob. Lenny, the suave gentleman, is 70. Popcorn, the man that "Loves" me, age unknown. Wayne, the eager to please Widower, is 65+. Bob, the "Nasty PIG", is 70-something. Lionel, the horn-dog, will be 74. The guys had fun teasing me, playing the Jukebox and reminiscing about old times.  They like it when I am behind the bar, because I don't give them any crap and I am kind to them.  Men are just big "little boys". Ten O'Clock comes around and it's time for the guys to leave, my $9.00 in tips in hand, we are heading to the door. Lionel stops and spews his usual begging routine, "Hey Mama, you sure you don't want to take care of a dirty ol' man?"  I decline and explain I would kill him, and he probably wouldn't last.  He chuckles and says, "Baby, it's ok, I got the Blue Pill and if ya kill me, I'll die a happy man." What a proposition...Geez!!

      My friend Popcorn took me to dinner last night at 22nd Street.   Steaks!  Yumm! It's been a long time since I had a steak dinner, hmmm, I think it was with Popcorn, I am seeing a pattern here.  Dinner was great and the conversation, well....let's just say you have to know Popcorn. Popcorn is old enough to be my Grandfather, I think, he won't tell me his age, and Popcorn has a crush on me.  This crush is fine, as long as he remembers he is just my friend, nothing more, we already had this conversation.  So we are sitting there, talking and this very handsome guy walks up to Popcorn and they start talking.  I am looking at this guy and he glances at me, and Wow....nice eyes, nice hair, nice everything... I think my mouth was hanging open and I may have been drooling, but I waited patiently for an intro and none came.  The guy left and I asked Popcorn why he didn't introduce me.  He said, "well, you are my date and I am not giving you up until I am ready."   Whooa, cowboy!   He then laughed it off, like he was teasing me.....I think we are going to have to have that talk again. Shortly thereafter, I was heading home...totally talked out, but a full tummy.   I think it will be awhile before I go to dinner with Popcorn again....but I might stop by the Grill again, maybe.

      Why is this day just a national holiday, why can't it be a worldwide recognized day?    I tell ya, I may not be from London, but I will celebrate like the Brits that's for sure.    The  urlLink "This is London Evening Standard"  gives Jordans Top Ten Tips on Tempting and Teasing to help with the first ever National Forplay Day on the 30th of July.    National Foreplay Day, sponsored by indulgence boutique, Beau Blue, climaxes on the 31st as it moves into National Orgasm Day!   I knew there was a reason I was flying out on the 31st......Whooo Hooo!

      I would like to start off by thanking the VFW members for giving me my token $6.25 in tips, which would have been less if my Mom hadn't slipped three bucks in my purse before I left.   I can now retire! Went by Legends after work for a little dancefloor workout with  urlLink J  and when I get there I almost missed her, because she is on the floor doing a line-dance with Red....Hmmmmmm?  She says he was there when she got there, but no need to explain to me, you are an adult.  After about an hour, it was time for me to go home, so I left J in the "somewhat stable" hands of Mr. Red. On my way home, I gave my man, Irv, a call.  I missed him and I am getting very, very excited about seeing him next week.  Anyway we were chatting away and he said, "Remember, you're not supposed to fall in love with me."  My comment was "Too late."  He was obviously put back by this and said that we were not going to go there, because it would put too much pressure on us next weekend.  I reassured him that there was no pressure, that my intentions are to go visit a friend and enjoy myself. All that said, let's put some clarity on the "Love" issue. I am a very loving and caring person (when I am not being selfish, I swear it's true), I have lots of friends, as well as acquaintences.  My friends are very special to me and I love each and every one of them.  This does not mean that I want to be intimate with them, it means I care about them.  There is a difference between love and "LOVE".  Ok?  Understand?  Good!    And my friends (in no particular order):  urlLink J , Keith, Janet, Nancy, Ali, Mark F., Billy-boy, Noah, Toad, Mike C., Sampson, Kat, Steve T., M & S, Jenn(Idaho), Julie(and her baby Coral too), D'Egidio(forever in our hearts), Dickie, Cheryl, Popcorn, Lenny, Lionel, Roz, Norella(Where are you?) and last but not least Irv. Don'tcha just feel the love?

      Tonight I am missing Bike Night, I am kind of bumming about not being able to go, but there are a few more nights before school starts back up, so I will ride again.   Tonight I will be playing bartender at the Local VFW Post, making a little cash for my trip next week, so this will be good.  Cash is always good.  Entertaining the members and having a few laughs is definately good.  So, look out gentlemen "Jasmine" is behind the bar!

      Ahhh, the weekend is over.   And a busy weekend it was. Friday's Pre-Christening bash, the Christening on Saturday and the reception after, were all a good time.  As soon as I could, I was out of the dress and heels and into the shorts and tank, heading to the FQ. I ended up having dinner by myself, because nobody could make up their mind, but met up with the gang after.  The Zoo and BBC were the happening spots, I even made it to  urlLink "my favorite store"  for some shopping and I spent way too much money. As usual the evening ended too quick, all had drunk their fill and the party broke up. I was on my way out to find me a cab when I bumped into an old friend.  There had been some heat that had passed between us on our other meetings and when I saw the look in his eye I knew there would be more than just heat that night.  We talked for awhile and we went to his place....and ohhh it was awesome.  I even got a backrub.  It was almost dawn and I needed to sleep, so I rolled over and dozed, I was on my side and about an hour later I woke up and I saw him staring at the ceiling...the stare of doom.   I know this stare, I do it too, but I usually have the pillow over my head and lose myself in  urlLink "Pillow Thoughts".    There are thoughts going through your mind when you are in this situation.  I rolled over and put the pillow over my head, this is not a good thing. My first thought was, if he touches me, it means it's ok and I was mistaken, but he didn't, so I was right.  Instead he got up and took a shower.   Now I am not one to wallow in self-pity, and pout that something didn't go right.  I just wish if a man makes a mistake...he admits it.  I admit, we should not have gone there, we were friends, and we probably won't be anymore (which is sad), we were two lonely people that had needs and we satified them.  Big deal...get over yourself!

      Another Wednesday at the "Pitstop", another Bike night.  The usual crowd and then some, when the radio station is giving away keys for your chance to win a Harley, shit yeah! you'll be there.    This time it's  urlLink J  that waits for her man, he shows and brings a friend, who I will call "Bud".  Couple minutes of chit-chat and on the bikes we were....Bud thinks he will make me scream and he thinks I will let my skirt flap around my waist, I am feeling challenged......we hit the Huey doing about 90, which is great for a few minutes, but as my cherub cheeks start to flap on the back of my head, I have had enough.  I gave Bud a slight tap on the ribs, now this means slow down, not faster, but faster he goes, so I dig my nails in his ribs with the next tap, since trying to holler to him is useless.  We hit a stop light and I am relieved, I can take a deep breath.  We finally stop and get gas and a drink, my skin tingles so badly that it feels like it's moving, this is not a pleasent feeling, calmed down and the tingling stopped, we head back.  Bud is going a little slower, since I told him I didn't like my face flapping, but still over the speed limit....he banks a curve in the road doing about 30 to 35, the limit is 15, it's a sharp turn and I panicked.  Sorry for leaning against you, but you didn't have to yell at me....just get me back to the "Pitstop", Thank you.  Don't get me wrong, I am up for a fast ride, but when I can't see and the air is not getting into my lungs I feel the panic start to build up.  And then there is fear...I have known fear, I try to avoid situations that I know are fearful and when I find myself in fear, I don't go back and do it again.  Back at the "Pitstop", we were standing there and waiting for the numbers to be called to get a key for the Harley and Bud is calling me "Hun", Hun? Where did that come from?...I am so ready to leave.  J wins a couple door prizes in the end and she, her Harley Man and Bud walk me to my car.   Now this is uncomfortable, I turn and Thank Bud for an exciting evening, and he asks what I am doing on Friday, I am honest with him and tell him I don't know, but don't offer to be with him.  He then tells me to give him a kiss.....I am sorry, I beg your pardon....he notices the hesitation, and he gets a peck on the cheek. I can tell ya, it was not a Love Connection and there won't be a second meeting, at least on purpose.  I am sure he is a great guy, but not my guy....a little to fast, in all ways, for me.  And just so you know....I did not scream and my skirt didn't flap, at least like he wanted.

      I have never been a huge smiley, bubbly person.  I have a look that is more on the serious side.....but have you ever wondered what is really behind that smirk on my face?  What am I thinking? Hmmmmm, make 'em wonder, that's my motto?    You're the smirk,a frown-smile hybrid that's a little bit cocky and usually associated with evil or arrogant,but attractive people.You probably just don't give a damn,but it's everyone else's fault if you don't because you're too awesome to have any real faults.    urlLink   What Kind of Smile are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I told ya I was a softy and it has nothing to do with my pleasently, plump, womanly figure!  The phone calls started about 11:45 am, from who you ask....hmmm, see "talk to the hand" below.....so, he calls, my work phone, I have to answer it.  He is asking me how I am doing, telling me about his mess of a life, and apologizing profusely for being a "Dick"(Ok, this we agree on).  This went on all afternoon, he must have called me 10 times, and each time he called he asked me out.   Finally, I told him that I had to get back to work and I would be at the "Pati" at 6:30.  I left work at 5:30 and I got three more calls on the way home, I was starting to get pissed, so I didn't answer them.  Did my thing at home, and checked my messages....totally blew me away that he was already there (he always stood me up, did he find a conscience?). I walked into the "Pati" and he is sitting there, he is all smug and with a grin said to me that he thought I would stand him up (It had crossed my mind). After about an hour of talking, I asked him if he wanted to come by and watch a movie or something, he accepted and we headed to my place.   All was good, the two of us cuddled up watching TV and it felt real good, a hug does wonders I tell ya.  One thing lead to another and we were rolling around like kids, it was nice, really nice and fun too.  This went on for a couple hours and after talking and cuddling, I needed to get some sleep, so I snuggle up and ask him to stay, which he accepted (you can believe me or not, your choice, but there had been no completed acts of sex).  After a few minutes, he jumps up and starts to go nuts, yelling, freaking and then I know.  He couldn't complete anything, because he is drugged.  I finally get him calmed down, I am actually sitting on him, and I ask him what he took.  Denial spews out of his mouth, but he finally confesses, a couple of these, a couple of those, probably a dozon or so different pills over the day, but swears he didn't bring any to my house and has not had any since he met up with me, well of course, he is coming down.   This doesn't really blow me away, I am not really shocked, I am sitting there and it's "Wow" I picked the wrong one again.  Then I think, we can fix this....so I ask him.....you have a choice, me or the pills?  I will stand by you, I will hold your hand, I will wipe your brow....stop taking pills.  And he says "No", that he can't....which means I can't and I asked him to leave.  It's really too bad, he was cute.

      I tell ya, sometimes I am not able to hold a grudge. (Unless you are Lerner's Clothing Store, I have not stepped foot in that store in 19 years.)   I ended up in the French Quarter last night, (I was lucky enough to get free parking) and I was walking around and what do I spy?  The Bike and then I see him.   We talked.   I forgave.   I would say we are now friends.  I think he is a good guy, just a major flirt, like me and we will have good times together.  Yes, I'll ride with him again and yes, I will be his friend.  You can't have too many friends ya know.

      It's was Friday night and I went to the Pub for Pizza and Pool with the girls.  The youngest of the "Three Musketeers" called in sick, so Angel and I were left to entertain each other.  Pub pizza consumed and Angel kicking my butt in pool 6 times in a row, I was in the mood to go dancing.  We cruised to Legends and it was the usual 40 something crowd, with the usual skimpily dressed bimbos, with the fake boobs and smelly perfume on the dance floor.   Angel and I were having a grand ol' time, laughing at the moves, when she got asked to dance.  She refused and told him to ask me, well hell why not.  We were on the dance floor swaying to the music when the next thing I knew he had me in a vice grip and his hand is on my ass.  Hold on Studdly, could I get your name first, whoa!  The dance is over and I thanked him and walked back to where Angel was and the guy came up behind us, a hand on Angels ass and his "ummm, something" grinding on mine.  He offered to buy us a drink and I looked over at Angel and refused, but thanked him anyway.  With that, I guess he went back to his friends, all I know for sure was that we left.  Enough was enough.  Question, did I miss the day in class when they taught you men that it is ok to rub your hard "Peter" on a girl after one dance?  Advice...It's not ok....unless she is rubbing on you.  So, we head back to the Pub for one more and when we get there, we are welcomed by a really good band.  Good tunes, not too bad to look at, ok one of them wasn't that hard on the eyes.  After their set was over we talked music and all that good stuff (I was in a band a long time ago, and I can carry a tune when I set my mind to it), Jeff the lead guitarist and singer gave me a magazine with their schedule and I told them I would see them tonight (Saturday).  Now for a Friday night, just me and Angel out, no goal to hook up, just hangin and having fun, we accomplished this and proud to say it was a blast.  Check out the Band,  urlLink Jeff Guitar Nelson   PS: I finally did win a game at pool too, against Jason (The 22 year old cutie), and I still had six balls on the table, I am so Awesome!

      A birthday is a celebration of completing another year of life.    Life has lessons, some you learn and some you don't.   Life is full of joy and pain, you take them both and ball them together and you learn to accept.  My favorite dude, my Lil' Buddy, will be celebrating his birthday tomorrow, the big 34 and he is feeling old.  Lil' Buddy, come on.....we still love ya!  Keep your chin up, it will get better I promise.  Happy Birthday Lil' Buddy! {Hugs!}

      Sometimes you have to travel to get what you want.  I have been talking to this very intriguing man, who I met through a singles service, for about 5 months now.  We talk on the phone and the internet several times a week.  Well, the past 2 months or so, I have been a pest about getting together, either he coming here to me or me going to him, to my joy - last night I invited myself to his place and he accepted.  The woman is takin a trip! I have my itinerary and I got my toothbrush in my purse.  Four nights of down and dirty, wild, passionate, uninhibited, untamed, raw, sweaty, scream till you go deaf sex! (What did you expect, the man has been teasing me for 5 months, he needs to be taught a lesson).  And for those that think I don't know what I am getting into.....one word....Webcam!

I typed in Heaven's Vixen in Google and page 2 almost to the end of the page I find this site.   urlLink Seriously Kinky List  Well, the curious in me had to check it out and to my joy it is a Serious List.  I have put a link in the "On the wish list", I hope you find something good, I know I have.

      The sun was out, the humidity was down and the bikes were beautiful.  Though the parking lot was full, the experience was a bit on the dull side.  It just seemed slow.  Top Hat showed, and though I had thought of many choice words to say to him, I kept them to myself.  He walked over to me and called me by my name, Hmmmmm?, and asked if I was still mad at him.  With my response as "Yes!", he graciously told me that that was fine, I had a right to be mad.  I thanked him for giving me permission and J and I slipped out unnoticed. "Legends" was the next stop, for dancing and scoping.  The band stikes up and it starts good, but then "Mandy" starts with her 80's top 40, and J and I groan.  It got worse as the band went on to play the "Electric Slide", we thought we had unknowingly joined a wedding reception. I was almost ready to bolt when out of the corner of our eyes we spotted two familiar faces, whooo hoo, it's "Starskey and Hutch" to the rescue (J and I work with these two guys, friends only).  We both ran over to them and gave them big hugs, welcome to our hell boys.  We whined to them about our evening, pointed out the losers and ended up sitting outside and talking.  The guys had to head out, Starskey to his wife and Hutch had to bring home his new treasures he purchased at "Bed, Bath and Beyond" (He, he, he), and I think we were debating whether or not to go ourselves when the band decided to actually play some decent music.  Well it's about time, we came to dance, gosh darn it!  On the floor we were, shakin our stuff, like two Hot women in heat, yup...that's what Harleyville is all about.

      It's so nice to be back at work, really it is.  My Co-Workers and friends missed me and before I sat at my desk I was filled in on the juicy gossip of the weekend.  My main stop was J's desk and she had the kicker of the day, ok maybe the week.  She tells me that she stopped by a bar over the weekend and saw Top Hat (the married biker dude), they chatted abit about how he should have told me he was married, how he never hid the fact, etc, etc, etc. Then he says, oh, your friend, yeah, "what's her name?"  My oh my, I guess he blew his brains out as well, when he Ejacked in his pants.  As for "ol' what's her name" here, she is over it and movin on.....next!

      Well, it's Tuesday and I arrived home safe and sound last night. I learned one thing over the weekend, ok two things.   First, don't drive for 10 plus hours with your brother and your niece in a little sporty Dodge Neon and second, if you want a complete weekend of peace, don't stay at your other brothers house. I love them both dearly and I know they try, but they are very short tempered and grouchy Dads.  My advice for them it to chill out, the kids are acting out because they want a reaction...ignore them, they will figure it out. It's good to be home, next vacation....me, beach and a cabana boy!

      Thursday night I hit the road, with my brother and niece, and headed to Orlando for the weekend.  (I haven't seen my other brother and his family in a couple years, how did I become such a bad sister?)  We arrived Friday morning and have done exactly what I had set my goals for, nothing but laying around and hang out.  The guys did finish the playfort/slide/swing set, which the kids love and my sister-in-law and I went and got a pedicure and a manicure, but all in all the most excitement has been the oldest niece coming down with a fever today and just not feeling very good.  There is nothing like a weekend of heaven, catching up with the family and laying around..............  Tuesday I will wake up and be back in reality, for now, don't bust my bubble!

      It was still Bike Night, and me looking absolutely sexy and just stood-up, I dusted myself off and bought a beer.   J wants a Coke (she has been suffering from a cold for weeks now), so we go in and bully up to the bar....there are so many people and smoke and noise, J leaves.  I get our order and head out, and I can't find her, I know she is around somewhere, so I scan for the red hair and find her next to the Men she had introduced me to last week.  Top Hat, pony-tailed dude (Sorry, Sweetheart , for the life of me I can not remember your name) and Dancing Bear.  Last week I rode with Top Hat and we had a blast.  He took me dancing, bought me beer and even took me for food.  He had tried making the moves on me last week, but I fended him off.  After a couple of beers and chit-chat, the pony-tailed dude wanted to head to the FQ to pick up his woman.   So, I on the back of Top Hat's bike and J on the back of Dancing Bear's bike head off with Pony-Tailed Dude.  We end up at a bar and Top Hat is a social butterfly, fluttering from one to the next, having a grand ol' time.  J looks miserable.  I know she isn't feeling good and Dancing Bear is putting on the moves.  Top Hat swerves over and puts his arm around me, whispers in my ear that he is a social person and he hoped it didn't bother me.  No bother, I think it is great....I have been dating dead-beats for so long that it is refreshing to see someone having fun. I am watching all this and thinking to myself, "Woman, you have been seeing losers that aren't going anywhere.  What is wrong with going out with a guy that is older(by 19 years), but will treat you like a queen, respect you and let you ride behind him."  I talked to J about it and she says to go for it.  My mind is made up, I will be Top Hat's woman before the end of the night.  J is getting worse, so Dancing Bear takes her back to her car and Top Hat and I, Pony-Tailed dude and his woman are off to the Dock, for dancing and flirting.  I am on the dance floor letting it all out.  I felt hot and very turned on, I strut over to Top Hat, wrap my arms around him and kiss him, a curl the man's toes kind of kiss, I lean back and he gets this funny look on his face, he starts to laugh and says that has never happened in his life.  I, the queen, made the man Ejack in his pants.  I did not touch anything but his face, with my lips and tongue on his lips, I am the Goddess!   Top Hat decides he is hungry, well of course he is, Duh....so he and I head to DB.  I am on the back of his bike, cruisin at about 80mph, I lean forward and I say, "Let's go back to your place", he says, "Can't"...Can't? Hmmmm, why not I ask.  Ohhh, no....yup, that's right, he is married.    Now tell me, why is this little known fact of your life not important to conversation, like before you stick you tongue down someone's throat and this someone is not your Wife?  So there we were, sitting at The DB eating chicken strips and cheese sticks, drinking beer and listening to tunes and I am floored.   He says he thought I knew, and I didn't.   He says he never tried to hide it, he wears a ring, he also wears gloves and I never saw the ring. He says that the marriage is at an "Impass", I tell him that I hope it's not because of me. He says he needs to make a decision, he is not happy, again I hope it's not because of me. All I know is I got stood up and I got lied to all in one night by two different men, and I didn't sleep with either of them. Wheeew!

      Let me tell you, there isn't a feeling like it in the world.  Bike Night!  Men, Bikes and Leather.  The smells, the sounds and the tastes. I left work early and started my vacation by stopping at the nail salon to fancy up my fingers, this endeaver took an hour and a half and I left without paint.  Now I had to meet my partner in crime (J) at 7 and the dude I have been trying to hook up with for the last month is supposed to ride in at 7:30. I scream out of the salon at 5:50 pm. I get home, jump in the shower, shave my legs, towel dry, powder, dress and put on my biker boots.  Do the make-up, hair and brush my teeth.  Paint my nails, grab a beer and my purse and I am out the door at 6:30.  (When I am in a hurry I don't fuck around, and I can not stand a man that takes longer than I do in the bathroom.)  Hit the store, need a PowerBall ticket it was 165 Mil last night, you could be reading a millionaires post right now, anyway......zoom in my cute new car to the Pitstop.  I am lookin sexy, I am feeling sexy and the dude is gonna get some tonight. We are there, J and I pull in the parking lot at the same time, we get out, and she is lookin Hot herself, Tats showing, cleavage that I am jealous of, and her kick-ass heels.   We saunter over, not too many bikes, but we have had rain all day.  J and I were not disappointed, you have a parking lot and they will come, I would say at one time there had to have been close to a hundred bikes. So, there we stood, looking around and I wait for the dude.  7:30 passes by and it is now close to 8, J says to call, and after a few minutes of deliberation I call.  The phone rings and rings, I figure he may be on his way and couldn't hear the phone, 10 minutes go by and I try again.  The chime sounds off in my ear, The Dude turned off his phone.  WTF!  Now I am pissed, I can not believe this, I am so mad.  I tell J about it, and she shares her choice words, and he is now on the don't call me list.  Don't get me wrong, I never dump a guy after one mistake, this guy has been messin around with my head for the last month and this was the last straw...ya know, he could have called, said anything and he would still be in my good graces...but no call and no show, talk to the hand sweetheart.

      Do you really want to know the Vixen?  This is something that many men have thought they wanted, some have lasted through a long term relationship and others have run with their tail between their legs after one date.   I am not saying I am a total Bitch, my attitude is part of me and has developed over the years from visualization and experience. I have watched women get stomped on by people and take it, because they feel this is the way it is supposed to be.  I am not an innocent, I have taken my share, but thanks to my second ex-husband, I don't take anymore.  You piss me off, you walk.

      Well....I made it, it's Friday!  I completed one full week of classes, only 12 more to go.  Last night was my English class and I thought I would hate it from the start, but I think I am gonna give it a chance.  I am not thrilled with doing argumentative essays, but there are only five and they don't have to be any longer than 450 words.  Not like the 12 page research paper from hell I am going to have to more than likely buy for my American Government class.  I will deal with it, I can deal with it.  Just one week at a time.  This week of classes has been surrounded by other tasks that don't normally fill up my schedule.  My parents have been out of town, so I have been housesitting and taking care of their animals.  The getting my lazy ass out of bed by 5am, to get ready for work, drive over to their house, feed the animals, and then get to work by 7:30, has cut into my sleep time. Also my Mom is the bartender for the VFW post and I have had to fill in for her.  I don't mind it, it's the cheap-assed old-timers, that whine and complain about how crappy their lives are and yell at me if they think I cheated them on a drink.  What the fuck do you want for a buck and fifty cents....Crown Royal?  Go down the street buddy, I can survive without your quarter tip....WTF!  Breath.....Mom and Dad will be back tomorrow...one more day, just one more day.  Tomorrow...ahhhh, can hardly wait.  Going to a Luau.  It's gonna be a blast!  Hopefully dancing after, depends on how I am feeling.....with my full schedule this week, I have been plagued with a severe sinus attack....ughhh!  It's Friday and I made it....I did, I did!

      Second class is over already.  It seems my teacher is in the process of fighting Terrorists, which is a fabulous thing, but why schedule him to teach a class if he is not available...I just don't understand how the college schedule process works I guess.  Speaking of schedules, I have decided that my so called advisor will no longer be advising me.  Mr. Hebert!!!    You are off my christmas card list, I can not believe I trusted you!!  You lying sack of POOP!!!  ( by the way, POOP is worse than shit.  Shit washes off, POOP is a permanent VooDoo curse!)  Easy class, EASY CLASS!!!  Argh!!   I hate papers and what is worse, the 12 page double spaced research paper is due before the oral presentation of it...I have to get up and speak infront of these people....Errrrrr!  OK, rant is done for tonight, anyone have a 12 page paper on the "Republic" by Plato, how about "The Politics" by Aristotle, or "Victims of Groupthink" by Irving Janus....this is gonna be fun!!

      Last night was my first night of school for this semester.  Algebra.  Fun....No no no...I have taken this class before.  I am so sick of this class.  My credits were not transferable, so here I am...in Junior High and bored, already!!  I get to class and the teacher walks in....Mr. Li....great, thick Japanese accent too.  Hands are being raised, questions about problems, etc. etc.  I am looking at the paper he hands out, class schedule, blah, blah, blah...and I notice the final exam date and time.  My hand goes up and I ask, "Excuse me, this is a night class correct?" He said yes. "Then why is the Final on a Monday morning?", I ask.  "Departamental" he says and asks us to open our books.    Hmmmm, I will be at the school before the end of the week, this is Bullshit!  So, anyway, Mr. Li, opens his mouth and in a monotone, Japanese accent, starts to explain Algebra.  I am flipping pages, high-lighting this and that.  Chin in palm, I don't remember dropping my high-lighter, but I remember my elbow slipping off the desk and my face almost hitting my book, and I snorted.  I look around, nobody seems to have noticed, I hear Mr. Li say, "Now if you will turn to page 70" I look down and I have already high-lighted past page 110.....I groan and say out loud, "Somebody shoot me!"  It's gonna be a long semester.

      The following "Letter of Recommendation" is something I came across while surfing.   Yes, I stole it!  So what!! I thought it was fitting after my unlucky weekend.  Toad never returned my email and he never called me back.  Chicken-shit!  He is so afraid of me it isn't funny. Tiger, yeah, I called him....he said he was coming over, and he did a no-show....another chicken shit. Sach, called and called...I didn't answer, can't deal with a big-talking, lame-ass, show-off. And then there was Giovani....hmmm, met him Saturday night, he was rude, I was rude back.  He paid attention after that.  Playful pats on the knee, gentle brushes as we would walk around each other, sarcastic banters for hours.  At 5am, I finally said, "hey you taking me home or are you coming home with me?".   Blew his mind....no sex happened, we ended up at my parents house, sipping wine and watching the sunrise while swimming in the pool(with suits).   I was hooked on this 6'6", Peoria born Italian stud and he was still stuck on his ex-wife.   Damn, damn, damn.   At 7am I walked him to his car, thanked him for the lovely morning, and told him to give me a call.  He won't and that's fine.  I don't need to be taking up my time with explaining the rules of non-relationship sex.  So, now the letter.  This is what they are missing out on, hmmm, thier loss...someone else's gain.  To Whom It May Concern:   I have had the privilege of the acquaintance of The Vixen for the past ? years, during which time we engaged in an exciting relationship, working together intimately for quite some time.  During the course of this affectionate association, The Vixen handled a great many inter-personal responsibilities, including but not limited to flirtatious e-mail correspondence, effective couch-based cuddling, and, of course, stimulating carnal encounters.  Without a doubt, I can say that The Vixen would make an excellent significant other for the foreseeable future.  The Vixen was always the rock that served as the base of our comfy understanding, able to quickly adapt and counter my own personal faults.  Her adaptability was key on several occasions, including one very memorable night on the floor of an unfurnished apartment.  Without this flexibility, in both senses of the word, no doubt I would have been forced to make compromises.  It is, however, a testament instead to her charming, effervescent personality that our friendship now is actually greater than it was during our private liaisons.  Indeed, her friendliness knows little bounds; you would be hard-pressed to get on her bad side, but if you do, you likely deserve it, and further, should likely move to another state.  However, while in her good graces, you will enjoy the pleasure of stimulating conversation, both learned and lustful.  Many a time, she has brought a smile to my lips, and she is as good a listener as she is a conversationalist, especially when said conversation takes place over the course of a few beverages.  I would be remiss if I did not mention her sterling physical capabilities at this time.  Without a doubt, she is notably voluptuous, and it would be challenging to find a better and more wonderfully curvy platform for low-cut blouses than she.  Further, her prowess in the bedroom is astonishing, and were I to have another chance to be invited therein, I would gladly take it.  You will not be disappointed, but you (and your neighbors) will likely be surprised at her intense demonstrations of enjoyment.  In closing, The Vixen will do good by you, entertain you, excite you, tire you out, cheer you up, comfort you, make you laugh, be there when you cry, and in all manners, make you feel good.  It is without reservation that I highly recommend her for any short- or long-term position in friendship, closeness and/or intimacy.  Sincerely,   X

      Everyone who has seen me, so far, has loved my new "do".  I have been told I look sexy, younger, beautiful, I have had second looks, and one man even slipped and said "I Love You"(don't get excited, not that kind of Love, geez).  This all does me little good. The woman is in need and she will have to use some feminine ingenuity to get what she craves.  Boys....men...you have been warned.

      I know I probably shouldn't have, but I IMed the man from this past weekend.  A closure thing, the need to know if I did something wrong, was I used, etc. I didn't get all the answers, but I know I was used, lied to...and it didn't have to be that way.    The following is an edited version of the IM I had with him(his name has been changed):  Vixie (9:44:08 AM): Hi, How are you? Did you enjoy the rest of your Vacation? thegentleman (9:45:39 AM): yeah it was ok thegentleman (9:45:39 AM): just slept Vixie (9:46:13 AM): Yeah...I guess it was needed Vixie (9:47:41 AM): I had a really nice time...Thank you Vixie (9:48:42 AM): I enjoyed your company thegentleman (9:49:36 AM): yeah it was fun thegentleman (9:49:41 AM): although I'm not too big a fan of NO Vixie (9:50:29 AM): Yeah..that was obvious thegentleman (9:51:02 AM): I don't know when I vacation thegentleman (9:51:08 AM): I prefer being in less populated areas thegentleman (9:51:19 AM): not to mention crime and piss ridden Vixie (9:52:30 AM): less people and craziness is a good thing thegentleman (9:53:31 AM): yep Vixie (9:57:33 AM): well, I got to get back to work.....by the way, I am not sure what I did to make you want me to leave on Sunday...but I would have appreciated a call... thegentleman (9:59:52 AM): life's a bitch Vixie (10:04:14 AM): Wow....Thanks....Hope you have a nice life, Sir...and thanks again for teaching me a lesson...don't let your guard down, and nobody will hurt you...Good-bye  Apparently, his idea of a gentleman and mine are different.   I genuinely hope he finds that "One"...and I hope she rips his heart out and stomps on his balls(Keith's idea on the balls) and makes him bleed!  I feel much better now!  Next!!

      It was supposed to be a really nice weekend with a successful, charming, affectionate man. It started out that way, really it did.  Friday he calls me in a panic, he was so excited about being on vacation, he missed the sign on the highway for his turn off and ended up in a not so great neighborhood in the middle of the Westbank.  I get him turned around and back into the city and while on the phone I heard his exclamation of joy as he pulled into his driveway. (Ya see, he hadn't been to town in quite sometime and ya know how it goes).  He is so thankful to me, instead of our Sunday date, he begs me to come over that night and see him.   Of course I said yes, ya think I am stupid. I ran home, did my essentuals(cats fed, changed clothes, etc.), stopped at the store(he asked me to pick up a few things), and headed his way.   I finally get there and he grabs my hand and we do the cheek-kissy thing.  Nice, tall, warm, yummmmm! He had been at the condo for about 4 hours and he had polished off a six pack of beer, so I asked if he had eaten, which he responds with, "I had some beef jerky at 2."   Ok, great...he is buzzing. I talk him into ordering food, which he eats some, and he starts to sound better. One thing lead to another and we are hugging and kissing and cuddling, he stops and says, "You know I decided before you got here, we weren't sleeping together."  Which I respond, "Fine, don't think the little soldier is in operating condition anyway."  All was good, laying together, talking, skinny dipping in the pool, holding each other, and talking more.  He mentioned about us going to Gulf Shores, and talked about the family in York, and us doing this and doing that.  He introduced me to his Uncle, and his sister. Hugging and kissing went on all weekend, with the exception of me leaving for a few hours on Saturday to do some errands. At One O'clock on Sunday, we went to "Sunday" dinner at his Uncle's. He put his arm around me while we sat and talked with his Uncle.  He would pat my knee, or wink at me too.  I am feeling all warm and fuzzy and I am really liking it.   After dinner we went back to his condo and watched some TV. Awhile goes by and he was craving steak, so we walked to the store, got some food and we walked back.  He fires up the grill, which pretty much blew up when he put the bacon wrapped shrimp on it and then it ran out of fuel.  The steaks ended up being baked and we settle in to watch a movie.   "The Sweetest Thing" with Cameron Diaz.   Well, the movie is funny, I am cracking up, he is getting cold.  I make comments that some of the scenes are so true, he is getting uncomfortable.  He scoots away to the other side of the couch.  Hmmm? Movie over, I clean up the dishes, call my folks and he is watching me.  I ask if everything is ok?  he said all was fine.  I then ask if he wants me to leave. No pause, no blink in the eye...."Yes, that would be best" he says. Wow, I am floored.  I put my shoes on, get my stuff and walk to the door.   He opens it, walks me to the gate, pats me on the back and tells me to call him when I get home, if I want. Then the floodgates break, as I round the corner.  I walked to my car, alone, tears streaming down my face, wondering what I did wrong. I finally get to my car and I start to sob, so I sat there a couple minutes. Regaining control, I grabbed my phone, wanting to know if maybe he would reconsider, maybe we could talk, but his cell is turned off and he isn't answering the house line. The gates reopened, tears streaming down my face I drove through the city, if it hadn't been for Mr. Atlanta and his soothing voice on the other end of the phone, I may have wrecked.  But he was there for me, listening to me ball my eyes out, blowing bubbles out my nose and snorting(romantic picture huh?). I still don't know what I did, and I probably never will.  I just know I let the walls down and he took advantage, and all I asked was he didn't lie to me, nothing else.   I don't get it. Mr. Atlanta says I wasn't stupid, but I was, in a way.   I trusted and I probably shouldn't have.   I gave without taking.   I believed him. I let him in. He hurt me and I cried. Pretty dumb.

      I took one of those free IQ Tests. Ok, I was bored and had a couple more hours till I could leave the office.  Anyway, I took this silly test, with questions like: what is the next in the sequence?(and it is either pictures or numbers or letters), If two cars started at point A together and traveled straight for 4 miles and turned left and travel 3 more miles, how far apart would they be?, Which does not belong in this group?, etc., ect.  Well, I scored a 137, amazing!   I guess I didn't fry all my braincells during the late 70's early 80's after-all.  I am a freakin genius...I want a raise!!

      I Love this City, I really do. You see the most amazing sights, all hours of the day and night. Bars are open 24/7 and sometimes you will get lucky and find a clean place to eat at 3am. I have seen drunks weave back and forth on foot, on bikes(moter and pedal) and in cars. I have watched people just fall over on the street and go into a deep sleep. I have seen men expose what they think is the most magical tool in the world and women with their sagging to the knees breasts bare it for 50 cent plastic trinkets. I have seen sex acts in the middle of the street and in corners of sleezy bars(ohhh sorry, ewww!). This last week has really taken the cake.  Now I don't live downtown, I live in a city about 15 miles away.  Rural, families, both rich and poor in the same neighborhoods, so this is really the sad part.  Monday on my way into work, at 6:45 am, I spy on the side of the road, in a grassy patch, sitting under a tree, two guys, sitting there, paper bags over their 40 ouncers.  Like it's freakin Sunday afternoon.  Tuesday, not sure, it was dark outside, a really bad storm came in, so that day doesn't count.  Wednesday, was the same as Monday...two guys, on the side, sipping 40 ouncers.  What is up with that?  Is your life so messed up you have to numb it by 7am.    Today....this is the gross one. I am minding my own business, driving in to work.  Radio playing, singing to the song, putting on lipstick..and the car in the lane next to me, about 50 feet in front of me, all of a sudden has it's passenger door open.  What is going on?  So I look closer and it looks like someone is dumping liquid out.   No. The passenger is not having a good morning. First thought, was I am gonna hurl...my second thought was..."Hey, Mr. Driver, your friend is gonna fall out of the damn car, you are booking it 50 miles an hour while he is losing his breakfast". I had to speed up, because the first thought came back, but I looked back and the driver still hadn't pulled over and the door was still open.    Now I have seen everything...and it's only Thursday!

      Wednesday bike night was the usual, even though the rain had scared some of the fair weather riders away.  No burgers on the grill, no venders selling their wares and no music blasting in the lot.  But the gang was there,  urlLink Miss J  was there and I met new and fasinating people.   Henry and his partner chatted with me about the French Quarter, the hot spots and the not so hot. They talked me into trying Southern Decadence again, this Labor Day Weekend, and told me where to hang out where I wouldn't stumble upon anything I had no desire to see.  Chatting done, pregnant pauses too frequent, Miss J and I head to Legends to shake our Booty.  The floor is empty, but not for long.  I came out of the bathroom and shimmied on to the floor, overpowering some chica with a backpack trying to boogie with "MY" Miss J (what was she thinking?).  Hot, sweaty, feet cramping in my 4 inch thin heeled boots, biker dudes drooling on the sidelines, J and I head outside to chat and cool off in front of the fans.    Just as we are about to sit down, this guy hollers to me, "Hey, you never came back to buy your car!" Ohh, no....the "Toyota man".   The same Toyota man that hit on me as I was trying to buy a car.   This is Mr. T's story: He asked me if I was from Jersey the day I went into the dealership.  I had lived there for a couple years, but I am not from Jersey...him knowing this now, he insisted on calling me Jersey Girl(Buddy strike one!). It was Memorial Day, I had just come from "The Daiquiri Dude's" house, was wearing shorts, a thin strapped top and a glow.  Mr. T kept looking at my tits and commented on my tattoo. I was asking him about financing and he said I had beautiful eyes. With brochures on the car in my hand, I left. Two days later, armed with information from the internet I went back to the dealership. I had come from work, so I was in a skirt and nice blouse.  I still had my work tags hanging from my blouse. I asked Mr. T why didn't he offer me the rebate I found on the internet, I asked him why the price of the car was higher than the MSRP, he said I cleaned up good(WTF asshole...strike two!). I repeatedly asked him these questions, he got flustered and passed me to another dealer, really!  This new dealer tried to answer my questions, I knew it wasn't his fault I thanked him for his time and I left.  Mr. T you just struck out!  So, now I am standing in the middle of the courtyard, looking as fine as a woman can look and I am confronted by this jerk.  Hand on hip and a sassy reply of "I bought a Dodge, sweetheart", had him grip his chest and gasp from rejection.  He then laughs and offers to buy us a drink, not sure if we declined or said maybe later, but he went back to his table and Miss J and I sat down at ours.  After awhile Mr. T comes over, asks if I come there often, says he would like to meet me there sometime, hands me a card and skedaddles. Well...I guess I should be flattered.  Hmmmm, no, not really, and that is why the card is probably in the dumpster behind Legends about now. I am such a Bitch!

      I got a call today. Not the kind of call you would expect from your 18 year old son.  "Mom, what are you doing November 22nd to December 1st?" (I do the math in my head real quick, ohh, no..I didn't even know he had a girlfriend!)(I know I am pathetic, but every time one of my children calls me and says, guess what? or can we talk? or even if they call out of the blue, this wave of dread passes over me, I am so not ready to be a Gran-ma-ma, though I would make a really cool one!)  "Mom!?"  "Yes, Jon...Um.....I'm not doing anything, I don't think. Why?" I say.  "I miss you Mom, and I want to come visit."  Awww, weep, weep!  This is good weeping.  We chat for awhile, I get info for his flight and he is all set to head south.  Before he hangs up he pauses and says, "I Love You, Mom!"  And I Love you too sweetie....my little boy, he makes a girl smile, all 6 feet 6 inches and 250 pounds of him, "sigh".  After we hang up, I remember I had planned to go visit them, both him and his sister for Thanksgiving.  Well, at least I hadn't bought my ticket yet, whew!    Now I have a dinner to plan, which is good, I can cook, really!  Got to make a list, hmmm, Turkey, sweet potatoes, turnip, pumpkin pie from scratch...ohhh my, I only have 3 months to plan...heheheeee!  I wonder if my daughter "T" would be interested in coming down too?  I'll have to call her.  Ohhh, anyone else?  We found a card table in the closet last week, seriously.

      This past week has been full of ups and downs...mostly downs. Ya see, I suffer from PMS, a form of depression.   I have had it since the beginning of time.  Some months it doesn't faze me and some are so bad I can't get out of bed, this month was close to the stay in bed kind. I have been to therapist's, taken medication(from Anti-depressants to Birth Control pills), support groups and even just suffered with it.    My second husband used the excuse that he couldn't make me happy that's why he left me for another woman.  John would call me the "Prozac Queen" when we would get in a fight.  Do the little hand wave and tell me to run along and call my "Shrink".  Loving support, huh? That's ok...he is working on wife number four, smokes too much, gets drunk every night and has to sleep with someone that has no tits. (Meoow!!)  Where did that Catty-Bitch come from?.....Ok, back on track here....PMS..  This week, I have gone from happy, smiling, beautiful woman one minute to weeping, moping, sad little girl the next.  It is a crazy messed up time, even I don't want to be me.  It's almost over though, I see the sunshine through the clouds as they say.  Bare with me, accept me and love me, that's all I ask.  That simple.  This too shall pass.

      My Horror-scope couldn't have been more right on this weekend.  Somehow the dark-shadow of woe-is-me is still lerking in the depths of my brain giving today a pity-party atmosphere.    I really got to snap out of this, it's really starting to give me a headache.  I guess what is really the problem is I miss some people.  When I lived up north, if I was in this kind of mood, there was always someone to call and cheer me up.   I have friends here, but they are different.   I miss Ali and her "Me, Me" world she lives in, Noah and his educational discussions about folk music and theatre, Jeff and his easy joking about everything, Mark and his Pork-n-cheez attitude, Billy-boy and his cozy embrace and tenderness, my daughter and when we would watch lightning dance off the bay, and even my son and how he is so much like his father.  If this isn't a script for Prozac, don't know what it is.....

      I overslept this morning...don't know...just did. I didn't do anything in particular last night, I didn't go out, I didn't stay up late. I went to the store after work and got myself a pint of Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream, went to the Video Store and rented,  urlLink Maid in Manhattan  and  urlLink The Family Man , sat on the couch with the fan going a hundred billion miles an hour and laid there.  Just me and the cats.  I don't get it....I guess I was just tired...ohh well.  After the movies, I signed on to check my mail (nothing), but I get a pop-up IM.    I get them all the time, sometimes it's fun and passes the time and sometimes it's a chore to deal with the idiots that think "IM" means Instant Matefinder.    Well, I am not sure if "Tiger" (the boy that IMed me last night) is in the idiot catagory, he didn't ask me to meet him at the Lakefront for some swapping of bodily fluids in the backseat of my car, he didn't ask me for my phone number, he didn't ask me to cyber, he didn't even ask me what I was wearing.  I guess he earned more bonus points for all of those.    The conversation with him last night got me to thinking this morning.  The entire IM thing, what is it, really?  Is it another form of communication for you and your friends and associates to use to keep in contact with other friends and associates?  Or is it another avenue for assholes to use lame pick-up lines to catch a susceptible woman during her lowest point?  Is it ok to send a message to a complete stranger and ask her if she does couples?  Or do you have a lunch break, you want to go have some fun?  Or I am married, but my wife doesn't understand me?  How about, Hey baby, I got a big Dick?  I loved the one where the guy asked if I did black.  Give me a break...would you walk up to some woman you don't even know and ask her these questions to her face?  Little Boy, you would get a knee in the crotch and a hand across the face!  Yes, you would. What is it all about?  Are we in such a hurry to screw, that we forget about manners?  Common sense!!, is there any left?  What ever happened to "Hello, how are you today"?  Come to think on it, Tiger did start with a Hello, how are you? and he spelled it all out...I guess not all boys are lost causes.

      Uneventful, maybe so.  Last night was Bike Night again, two more til school starts...sad, sad day that will be.   urlLink Miss J  and her new, and never again, dude were there.  Hung with the guys for awhile, "The Toad" showed up and I introduced the yummy boy to J. I like the Toad, he knows it, but he won't bite.  I talked with him for awhile, he is buying a bike (A Triumph, Hmmmm), he is getting a promotion at work, he broke up with this girl he was seeing, I asked him if he was going to Legends afterwards, he smiled and said maybe.  Tease!!  Went and found J, then we left for $5.00 steaks at Legends.  I was hoping to dance, but J left early and I was not going to stay there alone...I hate hanging out and dancing by myself.  Wow, I was home by ten.  J was the one with the Drama for the night.  She helped me join with a frantic call at 1am, panic...she said she would call back, which she didn't...so between no call back and the fact that the AC died last night, again I had a lousy nights sleep.   I feel the need for more chocolate, a nap and a sappy movie.

      I am feeling a little better today....I think. I skipped the chocolate cake (Good Girl). Instead, I finished up my "Haunted Tree" at ceramics, then hightailed it to "The Pati" to see my "Spanish Chica" and sat there for 2 1/2 hours drowning my sorrows in Bud Light (Bad Girl). I really don't know what came over me, and I still feel it hiding in the shadows....maybe it's PMS, I hope it's PMS.   If it's not, then I am doomed to be the little old lady who mixes peanuts with her popcorn, drinks Cranberry juice from those tiny juice glasses and sits in her Lazy-Boy watching syndicated sit-coms, dreaming about the good old days as her 25 billion cats rule her studio apartment.  Eeeee-gawd! It's PMS!!

      I was doing fine, really I was, then  urlLink Miss J  stopped by my cube, and fed me the tales of her weekend, in person.  How she feels and he feels, the emotional aspect of it all. And then it hit me.....Like a wave, real slow at first and then I crashed. She left, to be with him of course, and I shook it off. I didn't see the second wave come, it hit me out of nowhere and I was dumbfounded.  After all this time and all this work of putting up the shield and the hard attitude and I felt it.  Yes, I just spent a wonderful weekend with a great friend, but I am still alone.  Lonely and vulnerable, I have feelings, I hurt and I bleed like everyone else and I wonder am I doing it right? Wow, shake it off.....I think it's gonna be a chocolate cake night!

      Today, I am thankful. I am thankful to Mr. Atlanta for a fabulous weekend.  The sights,  urlLink Stone Mountain ,  urlLink the Lake , cooking me breakfast, dinner out and the company of a good man. I am thankful that the flight home was only delayed by an hour and the pilot figured out that through the building was not a short cut. I am thankful that my greeting, when I arrived home, was filled with Love, as my three cats howled and meowed at the sight of me. I am thankful for the lack of sleep because two of the said cats sat next to me all night and kept sniffing my face. I am thankful that my dad called this morning, because I slept through the alarm. I am thankful to Keith for buying my coffee for the next two months, but not so because he made sure I couldn't return the favor. Today, I am thankful. Thank you!

      Today, day three in the outskirts of Atlanta,  he is making breakfast again.   Like in the kitchen frying up bacon kind of breakfast.  Maple-flavored Bacon!! As for me, I am sitting right here in front of the computer, sipping the perfect cup of coffee.  Yup I am!  Don't be jealous.... I'll return the favor when he comes down to New Orleans.   I will hand him the keys to my car and give him directions to "Morning Call" .... heheeee!

       urlLink David Copperfield , yes...I went to his show in Gulfport, and my mom took me.  The show was good, the food was good, the room had a beautiful view of the gulf and I didn't win anything at the casino.  The best part was I saw the hunky "Magic Man", who took my mind off my upcoming travel and I am still trying to figure out how he got that '47 Lincoln on the stage in the middle of all those people.  Mom and I got back to the homefront around 2:15, Thursday, I did the last minute packing, talked to Irv and then I got really nervous.  I started to chatter and I couldn't sit still.  I know my brother was glad to get rid of me.  Mom came and got me, dropped me at the airport and when I went to get my seat assignment, the wonderful airline clerk person informed me that there was a flight delay.  One and a half hours.  Fucking great, now I can sit in the airport longer and work myself into a total tizzy.  Deep breath.....  It turned out to not be all that bad, but as Irv said, as the plane started to land, I started to shake and as I walked through the airport and rode the train, it got worse.  Then the escalator was staring me in the face and I knew he would be at the top waiting, so I took another deep breath, smiled to myself and rode up.  At the top I took a left and he was on the right and after a few steps I had a feeling, so I turned around and he was there, about 50 feet away.  I walked up to him and he smiled and I smiled and I hugged him and a quick kissie and I was here.  Safe, comfortable(but that shy nervous, still) and I knew it was ok.  The drive to the apartment was filled with small talk and listening to music, there was a fog over the  urlLink City , so I couldn't get the entire effect(I guess I will have to come back...heheee).    Then we were here, his place.  A man's place, yeah....he, his son, a cat and  urlLink KISS  stuff.  This is too cool!!!  I am not going into detail about what happened later, just gonna say it was good, really good.  The hand on my butt as he slept, the sigh from his lips as I slid my arm around him at 3am, the feel of his warmth through the entire night, the smell of him and the taste on my lips.  He is a good, kind man and I am lucky to have found him.  I am more excited about the rest of the weekend, I want to learn more about a man that I know will be a Best Friend to me and fill my nights with magic.

      Over the weekend I got myself a new pet.  He is a Male Betta, deep blue in color and I named him George LeFeesh.  I had to bring him to work, first my cat, Tabatha, was trying to play with him and second, I was missing him.   So, now he sits on my desk, in my little cube, next to the phone and the pictures of my kids.   Hopefully, when I answer the phone, I won't knock him over like I did in the car bringing him here this morning.    I almost committed vehicular fishslaughter!  Welcome to my world lil' George.

      What to do?  Mr. Fix-it really pissed me off.  I don't hear from him for 4 days and he calls and wonders why I didn't call him.   Ok, I have called in the past and everytime I do he is really busy, so it's easier for him to call me. It was Sunday about 3:30 when he called.  He asked what I was up too, blah, blah, blah.   He asked if we could get together....I said sure, why not. He said he had to go to Hammond and would call me when he got back. I went to bed after the game, about 11:30...no call.  I called him Monday about 8pm. He said he was finishing up a job. I asked how long. Til 9pm? He said could be. Told him fine, give me a call...but after 10 I was going to bed. At 10:30 I was in bed...no call.  This is not the first time...I am not in the mood for the game anymore. I'm not calling again....he isn't that good!

      It was totally wonderful!  Lately my Saturday nights have been playing pool and hanging with my "Spanish Chica", so last evening I gave her a call to find out if we are gonna hang out.  She is excited and needs to tell me something, but wants to wait till we get together.  A couple hours later I am at the Pub waiting for her, it's been a while, so I am just about to give up and the phone rings.  She is on her way.  When she walks in, she greets me with, "Are you ready?".  I am game, so we head out.  When we get to the cars I ask her what is going on and she tells me about hooking up with an old friend from high school and her friend is waiting for us at a club in Fat City.  I said, "Ok, a new place to play pool", she says, "No, dancing, at Rainbows".  My mouth popped open, Rainbows is a lesbian bar.  I have never been there, and I never in my wildest dreams thought she would be the one that took me there.  When we get there, her friends greet us, hugs, kisses on the cheek and in we go.   The place was packed and a very wide assortment of different types of women and men.  Some straight, some very gay, beautiful, not so pretty, tall, short, thin, round, dressed up and dressed down.  And I tell ya, the girls know how to dance.  Chica grabs my arm and says, "You are my woman, don't lose me."  Her friends laugh and we all end up on the dance floor.  Hands, arms, thighs, butts, rubbing, touching and I even got a tongue across my shoulder and collar bone (mostly to lick the drink off that really was accidentally spilled on me).  Chica's friend gave me a frontal lap dance and then sat on my lap and did some bounce dance, of course Chica couldn't be out done and bounced me after.   Never let a straight woman sit on your lap, she is too stiff. Around 2:30 am one of the girls' ex's showed up with her new woman, and you know them girls stick together.  Next thing I knew there was a cat fight to end all cat fights, a couple of our crew got tossed out and the ones that didn't, were really close to getting tossed too.  Chica and I decided it was time to go, first it was almost 4 in the morning and second, them bitches are crazy.  Man or woman, there are more out there, fighting over one is so not worth it. Crazy or not, bitches or not, gay or not, we really did have a good time.  Will I go again?  You got that right, Saturday nights will have to suffer without pool.

      The plan was to go dancing.  I missed it. The "Blue Pill" guy gave me a call and asked me to pick him up, he isn't driving anymore (he is 74) and he wanted to have a couple cocktails at the VFW.  Sure, I told him no problem, figured I would drop him at home around 9:30 and be on my way.  Well, we get to the bar and after a few minutes Mikey stops by and we start chatting.   He is a very intelligent man, very philosophical, and he stimulates my mind in such a way I never get enough.  He and I have a chemistry, there are always sparks when we are together, but not the kind of sparks that any type of intimacy would happen, we are satisfied with what we do have.   So, Mikey and I are talking, and the conversation is getting very deep, I realize I am neglecting "Blue Pill dude", so I turn to talk to him and he proceeds to fall off the bar stool, crashes across the room, hits the door, slides down the door and bangs his head on the floor.  You never saw three people jump so fast in your life.  My mom comes flying from behind the bar, Mikey is on his feet running to his aid and I am grabbing napkins to put on his elbows cuz he is bleeding everywhere.   Ohh it was awful.   I should have been paying more attention, some how the "Blue Pill Guy" got sloshed.  He became completely incoherent, so Mikey and I loaded him in my car, after we cleaned him up and checked the damages, and took him home.  Mikey carried him in the house, we emptied his pockets, took his shoes off and left him in his bed. By the time we got back to the bar, Mom had gone home, so Mikey and I stood out by his truck and talked.   Both of us were totally freaked out about what happened, and the conversation stayed there for awhile.  He then mentioned about his and my connection.  How he was stimulated by me in an intellectual way, blah, blah, blah.  I agreed with him and told him that it was from a spark I had felt the day I met him.   He then turns it around to how we can't do anything about it, that he is married and he will not destroy his inner place.  Whoa boy!  I didn't say I wanted anything more than what we have, I am totally blown away by the direction of his thoughts.   I get him calmed down and we both agree that our friendship means more than anything, then I am taken back when he asks for a hug.  He grabs me and hugs me and he is not letting me go, we are standing there for about 10 minutes, he then slowly releases me, gently kisses me on the lips, puts his hand to my cheek and climbs in his truck and leaves. I watched him drive away toward home, standing there till the taillights were no longer visible, and I felt whole.  I probably shouldn't have felt that good, but I did and still do today.  I know my friend will always be there, and we share something, something really deep and binding.   Scary huh?

      While deleting the mailbox contents of my "good girl" address, one email's subject stood out.   "Classmates.com has a message for you"  I debated for a few seconds, I really hate opening Spam, it seems it is just an invitation for more crap in my mailbox.  Anyway, I opened it, and I was totally surprised.  Apparently a girlfriend from the past was looking for me and through Classmates, she was able to find me.  Wow, I guess those locaters really work.  Well, since yesterday we have caught up on the last 14 years, (not fully, the cliff-note versions) and to me it seems like we never lost contact.  Ohhh, the days of riding down Main Street, roller skating at the rink, chasing down Kennedy's Limo, picking up dudes and sipping on beers in the back of my van, cuz we thought we were cool.  Gawd, we were stupid!  But it was fun!  It is really amazing how you feel when this happens, it makes you warm and gooshy inside and like a kid again, ok so I always feel like a kid...whatever!  So, I just want to say, I missed ya, "Heidi Ho" and welcome back into my life....ohhh the fun we will have...   PS: One more thing, H, I may have been the Momma first, but you are the Gran-momma...hahahahaaa, don't ya love Step-Kids!

      I was asked the question, "What's the difference between Swapping and Swinging?"  Good question.  Swapping is when two couples switch partners with each other.  Most times when you find a couple that you like you don't stray from them, you end up having a 4 way relationship.  If this works, it is wonderful, but sometimes, like in many relationships, communication breaks down and disaster happens.  Swinging is usually a group of people swapping.  Almost like a club, ok it is a club.  It is mostly couples, with some singles, the majority of singles are women and most of those women are bisexual.  The swingers clubs will meet (Party) at a home or hotel once or twice a month, eat, drink and literally pick up someone - One on one, couples, same sex (women), and there is always a common (orgy) room.  These types of gatherings are not for the timid or jealous types.  You have to know the game and you have to love the game.  Plain and simple, it's just sex for pleasure.  If you can't handle it, don't dabble in it, it not a forgiving game, it will scar you, I have seen the damage. The most important person at these "Parties" is the Host or Hostess {curtsey}, He/She is responsible for organizing the party and making sure all are happy.  He/She is greatly rewarded for their generosity, many, many times over.

       urlLink Miss J  greeted me with an "I Hate You" this morning, which I knew she didn't really, she was a just a little jealous because of the look on my face.  "Sigh", yes, me and Mr. Fix-it finally hooked up and he "Fixed me up" alrighty.  I don't even think I made it in the door before the wrestling started.  The man knows how to take care of business, I will give him that.  Afterwards, I am sitting on his bed, clad in my Georgia Bulldogs Mini-Tee, with him sitting in his recliner, and we started talking.   No, I started talking....I told him pretty close to everything. Ex-Husband John. Swapping. Swinging. Hostessing. Bi-sexuality.  He was not shocked, he didn't ask me to leave, he just nodded his head...... His only questions were, how did it start and will I ever do that again? The starting is a long story, a desperate woman trying to save her marriage, to which I gave him the edited version(because of time). Doing again?   Who can resist the soft feel of a beautiful woman? {Wink} He gave me one of his laughs, that deep throaty kind that makes you warm all over.  The kind you want around for awhile.

      The men in my life....I have no idea what has come over them.  Mr. Atlanta is in love.  Not with me.  I know he has feelings for me and he cares about me, as I do him, but to be honest there was no "SHAZAM".  I felt a pang, mostly from my greed....(he is mine).....maybe jealousy that he found "the place" before me....but honestly I am happy for him.  I truly hope it works for him.   I will cherish what we have until the end.  He says nothing will change between us, but I know, I have been there before.  The girlfriend will want to know why he needs to talk to another woman when she is there for him now, blah, blah, blah.  "Sigh", at least I will always know I can do for him what she will never do, {Grin}....Kisses Irv, Love ya!  Tico....I have not talked to Tico in days.  It seems he wanted to get nasty via Instant Messages while I was at work.  I can't do that at work, give me a break.  Anyway, he was telling me how he was gonna pin me down and tickle me.  I told him he was not, because I do not like to be tickled.  I have issues with it.  He was a total pain in the ass about it and went off on a tangent about how women he likes don't like him.  Whine, whine, whine!   Buddy!! I DO NOT LIKE TO BE TICKLED. If you want to know why, get a court order and ask my shrink! Geez, what the fuck!  I thought I had issues.  Then there is Mr. Fix-it.  We tried to get together and do something all weekend.  He always ran into a problem canceling any of my plans.   Fine no big deal. Last night, he calls and the first thing out of his mouth was, "You just get home, where you been?" {sound of screeching brakes} Ummm, none of you business sweetie!  He then remembers I have school and that is acceptable.  I am a bit irked so I turn the tables and remind him that he had been blowing me off all weekend and that we aren't at a spot where he can ask where I have been.  The entire conversation, which lasted about an hour, was sprinkled with innuendo of LTR's and something more than the F-Buddy relationship.  I had to hang up, I was getting a headache.  I thought he understood.   I have a feeling he is gonna ask for more and I will have to not see him anymore.  There isn't a Love Connection.  Bummer, he is really good.

      As usual, my intentions and my list of to do's were a bust. Car is still dirty, tho I did clean out all the trash from the backseat. Didn't even go to the store and shop, so no new bra. and the worst part(Not counting that I didn't even have sex!), I didn't get a chance to have at least one martini. No Goose.  I was busy all weekend, but accomplished nothing!  What a waste!  I did work on the Beetle.....banged on the Carborator and lubed her up....no luck, she still isn't excelerating.   Talked to Mr. Fix-it, he called again for a "you know", unfortunately nothing developed, and that is the story of my life.   I can't even hook up with a short, bald, old fart for a quick roll in the hay.   But he did say he would look at the car and help me get her purrin...or was that me?  Either way, okay baby!  So tonight will try again.....one martini....maybe two...Goose, Goose, Duck!  I will have to visit my Spanish Chica and have her make me up something special, cuz it is Monday ya know....can't miss Monday Night Football happy specials.

      How low can my weekend go?  I ended up tending bar last night, not too bad, cuz I thought I would go out after, but Miss J didn't call(no Dancing)..booo hooo. Bonus, Mr. Fix-it called and said "Bootie Call"...told him I would call him back, for I was counting money and closing the bar. While driving home I tried to call, but no answer....hmmmmm? Turned out he went out for cocktails and by the time I caught up with him it was almost midnight and I was out of commission....dang it!!!  Did absolutely nothing on my list today....but got another "bootie call". Ok baby, yes......He said he had errands....I said, call me when you get back from your errands...  At 1 am I sat at a pool hall, being whooooped by an old timer, and still no call.  So I called and he was sleeping.....Ha! Damn him!

      The following is a list of "I need to do" this weekend:  1) Drink a Goose Martini, extra olives please. 2) Wash my car and clean the interior. 3) Drink another Goose Martini....can I get two toothpicks of olives with that? 4) Buy a black strapless bra. 5) Celebrate with a Goose Martini....ohhhh olives, yummy! 6) Throw out the dead plants that are in my backyard. 7) Sit on the lounge chair in my backyard and sip a Goose Martini....Hey, you forgot my olives! 8) Go dancing. 9) Finish off that bottle of Goose and who cares about the olives. 10) List?  What list?  and in between all that, a little sex would make a girl happy.....

      Dad stopped by my cube and informed me that Momma had surgery yesterday.  Okay...... 1) I work with my dad and he did not tell me that momma had surgery scheduled. 2) I live less than a mile from my parents house and nobody stopped by to tell me. 3) I spoke to my momma on Tuesday and she did not say a word. 4) My sister knew. Hellllooooooo people, I am not a mind reader! Tell me WTF is going on in my own family! Geeeeez!  So now, I have spoken to my mother, informed her that I am running the bar tonight and she filled me in on the whole story. Momma was diagnosed with Bowen's Disease, a slow developing type of skin cancer, a couple weeks ago.  The area effected was a patch on her back about 1 x 2 inches.  The doctor did a biopsy and they were waiting on the result.  Yesterday, she went in and they immediately put her on the table because the tests revealed "Basal Cell Carcinoma".  She is in some pain, the result of cutting a large area out of her back and about a hundred stitches, but she was given some happy pills so she isn't too grumpy and she did not put up a fight about staying home from work tonight.  In the end, family is forgiven for not telling me in advance, because they didn't know, BUT......someone could have left me a voicemail last night, ya know!  PS: Momma will be ok, they believe they got it all and she will be going in for regular checks and staying out of the sun.

      I got an E-mail invitation the other day, not that I feel special about it, it went out to probably 200 people and my lucky stars, I was on one of those lists.  Anyway, I am seriously considering this invitation.   It's to a Navy Ball. Never been to a Navy Ball before, though I have been to a Coast Guard Ball, they can't be that different. The idea of being in a room with so many uniforms, ohhhhh my!  There really shouldn't be that much to think about, other than the fact I would be going alone. But I would look absolutely fabulous in my new Ball Gown (which I happen to buy a month or so ago, just in case, and it was on sale real cheap).  I could do this.  I would like to be Cinderella for a night, why not?  I think I need new shoes.....

      I could hear the alarm, it seemed off in the distance.   As I reached over to turn it off, his arm brushed mine and covered my hand on the button, we clicked it off together.   His hand lazily stoked up my arm and he tucked me in his embrace while he cupped my breast in his hand.   He slowly started with kisses across my back and he nipped at my ear, making me turn in his arms and face him. I looked into his beautiful eyes and I reached for him.   His lips tasted like Strawberries and they were warm and soft.   Gentle, not like the night before when the passion was so great that we could not restrain ourselves, but like when you are touching the most delicate thing in the world. We were slow in our lovemaking, sensuous, tender. I could feel him get warmer, and when I knew I couldn't take anymore, we climaxed together. Laying there in his arms, kissing, holding each other, not wanting to let go....  And the alarm goes off, loud this time and I open my eyes and realize it was nothing but a dream.....

      After almost 4 weeks of classes, enough homework to drive an over-achiever insane, and enough stress to develop disgusting diseases.  I have decided it's not worth it and I dropped my math class.   How did I decide on that one to drop?  Hmmmm, language barrier, and he can't teach to save his life.  My decission made, it feels like a weight has been lifted and I can breath.  Now, I have two extra nights to myself, what to do is the question for today?   Bike Night?   Dancing?   or go home and be a good girl?    Good Girl?.....Nahhhhhhh!  Whooooo hooooooo!!!

      There is one more reason to add in my log book to despise Barbie.  Not only is she a representative of the fake, plastic, shallowness that a large majority of the male population wants, she is now a threat to morality.  Now that  urlLink Saudi Arabia's religious police  have declared her a harlot and offensive, maybe the American man will get over the fantasy of one day banging her.(I know I am dreaming)  Boys.....She is plastic, she is cheap, she is fake.   Most of all, she is a figment of your imagination.    But, if you are so lucky to snag one of these creatures of plastic surgeryland, don't lose your job, don't cut off her allowance and most of all don't screw up....She will take everything you got and turn you into the washed up loser you were meant to be.  Now, go out this weekend and have a good time.....happy hunting!

      Today being the second Anniversary of the attack on the United States of America, most of last night and this morning I have been contemplating what I was going to post.  On my way in to work the radio stations played the tribute songs and allowed moments of silence in memory of our lost loved ones and hero's.  When "Proud to be an American" played, I blasted the radio, and let the tears fall.  I sat on the Huey, waiting for the traffic to move, and thought of what I was doing two years ago.    The night before, September 10,2001, I was sitting in  urlLink Hooters"  in Davenport, Iowa, drinking dollar drafts and eating chicken wings, watching a ball game on TV. (This is what you do when you live in a hotel and have nothing better to do.  Ewwww, Quad-Cities!)  The next morning, we(me and boyfriend) woke up late(about 10) and we were driving to  urlLink Clarence (population 936, and he thought I would move there, yea right!), I am fiddling with the radio and the news is on.  At first I thought it was a sick joke and then I thought I was going to be sick.  I started to yell at the boyfriend to turn around, but he wouldn't.  He said there was nothing we could do, so he kept driving and I kept crying.   By the time we got back to the hotel, I was raw feeling.  I lived in New York, I lived in Virginia(near DC), I had just moved to Iowa from Massachusetts.  I was broken hearted that the cities I knew and loved would never be the same.  I was in mourning for myself and for those that had lost so much.  I was devastated because I was too naive. I thought that as an American, this would never happen here in America.  I sat in front of the TV, like millions of other people and watched the events unfold over and over again. Day by day, what I saw made me more aware.    First, the anger toward the money hungry asses that tried to monopolize on the tragedy of the people.    The price gawgers, the selfish retarded assholes, who the hell do you think you are.   Pay Four Fucking dollars for a gallon of gas, keep your gas, I'd rather walk.    Then, after the panic subsided, and the President spoke, and Rudy took control, the America I know came out.  The helping hands, the hugs, the unselfish donations of self, the Americans I am proud to say are true Americans.   Honorable, selfless, caring, people. I remember the Friday after, the town was asked to go to church.   To be there for a noon service. I don't go to church, but I was there. I sang loud and proud, I cried, I held hands with thy neighbor, I hugged thy neighbor and when I left that church I felt better inside.   I felt hope.  Now, two years later, we have  urlLink men  and  urlLink women   urlLink overseas  fighting for us.  We got mad and they were warned, repeatedly, over many, many years.  Our President, George W. Bush(Junior), has stood proud for his actions.  He will not back down.    I am not going to turn this post into a political discussion, but my opinion will be stated.  I am proud of our  urlLink President.   He is a man with a mission and he will not give up.  He has not lost his focus.  I can not say that for all people.  I am sick and tired of people whining about how this has gone on forever, how GW is fighting his daddy's war.    People....You forget....How dare you!  If you don't like how it's done and you think you can do a better job, run for office. If you think that GW should be out of office, start a petition. If you hate America because of one thing or another.....GET THE FUCK OUT! We don't need you!  I am proud of America and I am proud to be an American.  ....."God Bless America", "One Nation Under God".....

      Part of last nights dream has me befuddled.  I have a grocery cart in front of me and I am walking into a store.   I see wood floors and wood walls.   I push my cart into the produce section and I want fruit, but all the fruit is rotten.  I am grossed out because I see black watermelon, and shriveled up strawberries, and I am angry that the potatoes and onions are fine.   I want fruit so bad I can feel my mouth watering, and tears welling up in my eyes, because I can't have any fruit.   I find myself wandering through the store, it has a musty smell, and every time I get to the end of an isle I have to turn around because I am at a dead end.   I have a few things in my carriage and I make sure they are things that won't go bad.   The items are in cans or jars. I am not sure what they are, but I know that they are good to eat.  Then, I get to the check out, and there are people, but they aren't standing in line. I can't get in line myself because I have to wait for them.  The only thing I know is I have 10 minutes to get out of the store.  At this point I woke up, so I don't know if I made it or not.  Ok, the end of the dream, or at the point I woke up, I understand, but what is up with the fruit?

      It's kind of awakening when you sit down to learn something in class and what you learn is you aren't one chapter behind in your reading, you are almost 3 chapters behind.  I didn't panic, not until I got home and started to read.  I finished chapter 3, and started on the Constitution.  But I have chapters 4, 5 and 6 to finish before Tuesdays class.  Am I absorbing any of this? Probably not, but I like my highlighter, makes me think I know what I am doing. I also learned that not only do I have to read "Presidential Purpose" (I think that's the title), and I have to write a 12 page argumentative paper about it, but four pages have to be my arguement and I have to have at least 5 references that back up my arguement.  (This means I have to read Five more books on how to make a President, owwweeee!!) Ok, this guy might be cute...but he ain't that cute!  I finished my Rough Draft for English...and it may piss off the teacher.  He asked for it, making me write a stupid assed paper on whether or not the writing curriculum need to be increased or not.  Who cares? I want to be an accountant!  Math....hmmmm, have class tonight, I can take a nap!

      It's been a very long day, and feels longer, since I am tired from lack of sleep. (No, I was in bed alone last  night) I have been plagued by nightmares the past two nights, deep sleep ones, and I can't remember the entire dream.  All I know is, I was with people I know, friends and family, and I was trying to help them(I don't know what I trying to help them with), and the air was thick(it was hard to breath) and I couldn't keep up, and the Boogie-man was gonna get me if I went too slow.  Then I woke up, and I knew I had a dream, but I was confused as to where I was, and I was a little scared.  Scared because of the disorientation and scared because I knew I had a nightmare.  Weird! So today I analyzed the dream....what does it mean?  First, it is stress.  I know I took on too much with school.  I have 5 papers in English to do and that sucky 12 page paper for A.G.  and second, I need a vacation, I talked in my sleep last night, that is one of the things that woke me from the dream and when I talk in my sleep it means it's time for a vacation. There...hopefully tonight I will sleep like a baby!  Now, I am soon off to my Tuesday class, with that hunky Military Pilot as my teacher.... Hmmm, maybe he can keep the Boogie-man away!

      Of the three men that have popped up in my life in the past week, the one that I wanted the most has been transfered. The Firemen.   Before he and I met, he had put in for a job transfer to Langley AFB, and Saturday he got the call of acceptance.  He told me this morning, via internet, that he was sorry and he hoped I understood.   Gawd...it's not like we were an item or anything, didn't even kiss him.   I wished him good luck on his new job, and wished him the best in his future.  {Sigh} But he was really cute, Darn, darn, darn.  I have not heard from Mr. Fix-it today, but it's early and I know he will call and wonder what I am up to.  He had become a little possesive on Saturday, expected me to go over to his place or invite him over.  No, not the way it works buddy. He has been properly informed as to how it does work and he will accept it.  Tico called.  He wanted to let me know he waited for me on Friday night.  Hmmmmm, I do not recall an invite.  He told me that he was hanging out with friends, I took that as he was busy.  No biggie.....The next time he will have to be more assertive, I don't read minds.

      A few days ago my mother was diagnosed with  urlLink Bowen's Disease.    She noticed a small ring on her back over a year ago, and thought is was hives or ringworm, it turned out to be cancer.  Bowen's Disease is a slow developing cancer of the skin.  A rare disease, but her doctor told her that it is common in Irish desendants.   So, all you Irish people, get checked out.   Stay out of the sun, or use sunscreen.   Be careful, and be wise.

      Well, I met the Fireman last evening.  The original plan was to meet at Borders Book Store for coffee, and to call him as soon as I got in the parking lot.  I was driving on the side road next to the store and I looked over to the lot and I saw him walk in.   OMG!!! He is gorgeous, freakin, roll me over gorgeous!!!  I pulled in the lot and called him, he was upset that the place was packed and he suggested going over to Starbucks instead.  I agreed and he walked out of the store and straight toward me (since I was standing by my car).  He stood in front of me, all 6'3" of hunk of burning desire, and he smiled at me.  Then he looked me in the eye and said, "You are so cute."  {Blush} Me, cute....Ohhh my.   The next hour and a half we sat there talking, his parents, his job, my job, my kids, pets, vacations, etc.... I remember almost every word and I was lost in those beautiful brown eyes.  He had said we would get together Saturday, but his parents had something come up (Parents are older, Dad had knee surgery, Mom is in remission from Breast Cancer) and they want him to drive them to Biloxi.  He said we were intellegent adults and we would figure something out.  He wants to see me again, to talk, to get to know each other, and this is ok with me. He asked if I would like him to walk me to my car. "Yes, Please." He asked if he could call me tomorrow. "I told him he better." Then, he bent over to hug me, Nice, very nice.  He liked it too, and hugged me again.  A quick peck good-night and he was off to his Union meeting and I was off to class. Hmmmmmm....now I am more frustrated...but not for long, and that is a promise.

      I just don't get it. I have been in a drought of no dates, no men, no action for weeks and the past 3 days it's been like a torrential downpour.  I have been talking to Tico for months and finally, he met me for coffee last night after class.  He showed up late, but he called, so that was forgivable.  Anyway, he got there a little after 8 and at five minutes to 11, I was saying goodnight to him in the parking lot.  We talked and talked...ok, he talked and talked.  I think I pretty much know everything about this big ol' Teddy Bear.  He is sweet, and crazy, and he is a good man.  Kind-hearted, gentle, and sincere. (Oh, he is gonna hate it when he reads this.) He has the desire to be bad, but either he doesn't know how or he has a fear of the consequences.  I will continue to talk to him, I like him...why? He is freakin nuts, that's why...oh, and he owes me dinner.  Mr. Fix it.  Miss J met him over the weekend and gave him my number.  We have talked on the phone a few times, including a two hour marathon of laughs.  He seems really nice, and funny, and confident.  He knows how to be bad, understands the meaning of non-relationship sex, and talks the talk.  I think we have some kind of date on Friday night, if he gets his race-car fixed to the way he likes it.  If he doesn't I am shit out of luck...wait, no, he is shit out of luck.  Then there is Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman is young.  He is single.  He is tall.  He is good, he knows the meaning of F*Buddy, and he isn't looking for a serious relationship.  He is meeting me for coffee before class today to chat.  We are getting together Saturday for drinks.  Mr. Fireman will not be disappointed.  I think I am gonna need a life-preserver!

      American Government. As I sat in the classroom tonight, with 25 other people, we all wondered if our teacher would be there.  Last week we had been informed that he was off fighting Terrorists.  My definition of fighting Terrorists is being in one of those far off countries, kicking butt and saving the world from Osa and Sadam.   I soon found out different. In walks this 6'+, nicely built man in his late 40's early 50's.   He tells us that he is a military pilot.   He works with "Homeland Security" and when there is a high Terrorist threat, he flys over whatever city is in a threat.   Cool! So, after a brief intro and discussion about what is expected, he starts on his lecture. I am sitting there, taking notes and then I start to listen to his voice. I get a flash back, I am in the 9th grade, sitting in 9th grade history, and in walks Mr. Kincaid.   Hunky stud of burning desire.   So, I look up, and I start to watch him.  He is into his lecture, passionate, excited and I am starting to think to myself, "Ohhh, please don't mess up this class"  "How am I going to impress this guy"   I, at 38 years old....have a crush on my teacher.

      August 29:  Lionels' Birthday....age 74, 13 teeth, drinks too much, smokes too much, but has the "Blue Pill".   Lionel showed up at the VFW, which was being run by "Moi" aka Jasmine, as my parents are still out of town, I got him a little single-person cake and a funny card. (He is a lonely old man, his daughter doesn't even come and see him anymore, the bitch.) Anyway, a few friends stopped by, (nice to actually serve people drinks) chit-chat, blah blah blah and I ended up taking Lionel to his favorite haunt after I closed down the bar.    Coach's.    I was sitting at the Jukebox picking some songs and this guy sat on my lap, Tommy.  I know Tommy, he is cute, and crude, and a blabber-mouth, selfish, overconfident, you know the usual 40-something ego.  So he is sitting on my lap and he says, you are beautiful, I love the way you sing, the way you look, and you smell good (I know a pick up line when I hear it).  Tommy tells me he has been asking around for me, and he was too afraid to ask me for my number the last time he saw me. (another pick up line)  I figure what the heck, let see what this guy is about and I give him my number.   The night was getting late so I drove Lionel home and I went home.  I had to work the next morning and I needed to be a good girl.  August 30: Worked....I gave away 230 cans of Campbell's Soup during a marathon demonstration.  Single serving sip cups.  I was beat, I was sick, I needed a nap...got home around 3:30, thought to myself....Hmmmm, I can take an hour nap and be at the Luau in plenty of time......Yeah, I woke up at 8, so I missed the Luau, crap!   Instead I spent some time with my niece, we colored and watched one of her Power Puff Movies.  Always an experience to cuddle up with a 5 year old and have her pet your head and say, "Auntie, you are so pretty, I Love You."    The little Vixen always gets me.  August 31: Worked the bar again, even though Mom and Dad were back from their trip.  Didn't want to stay home, so I volunteered.  I finished my American Government homework before my first customer showed, so I accomplished something.  The usual crowd and a few new faces, even topped my highest tip record at 10 bucks, whoo-hooo!!  Arguments got so heated about politics and whining about the post attendence, I finally had had enough and I slapped the counter and said in a firm voice, "If you all don't like the way things are run around here and if you all think that people need to come here, then get up off your lazy asses and do something about it."  "I am sick and tired of you people whining and bitching about the post and you don't do anything, put your money where your mouth is and do it."  I had 10 pairs of eyes staring at me, mouths hung open and after a few seconds the subject was changed.   Amazing! Another amazing thing, Lionel needed a ride home again, and he wanted to stop at Coach's again, go figure! So we are at Coach's, I am sitting at the bar, Coach(Owner) comes over and sits next to me, we are chatting about life and his experiences.  After a few minutes I am realizing the old timer is hitting on me, lordy lordy, the buck is 84 years old.   Why me?   He finally realizes he isn't getting anywhere and he sees my irritation and he appologizes for his behavior.   Accepted.   And I was offered a job.   Bartending, hmmmmm, cash....I like cash.  This would be good, one or two nights a month, 300 bucks or so in tips per night(it's a busy place)...I could definately deal with that, yesireeeee!  Sept 1:  It's September!  Wow!  Went to a Labor day party at the Post, burgers, dogs, music, sitting around chatting with the folks....I won the 50-50 raffle, 73 dollars in my pocket, Yippeeeee! Money was burning a hole in my pocket so I went to dinner and then found myself home by 8.   Surfed the internet and up pops Tico.   Tico is a local dude that IMed me a few months back....could be close to five month ago now....anyway, Tico is nuts.  It's hard to tell if he is joking or serious, but he makes me smile on occasion.   Last night he spent the first 10 minutes of our conversing sending me little jokes in the IM screen, but I finally got him to have a "normal" conversation with me.  We chatted for awhile and as usual I started teasing him about never going out with me.   I really think the man is shy. He is a 47 year old father of three. Separated. Devoted to his children. Career student, but has a real job. Not quite sure what he wants to do when he grows up. Typical Male. But shy. Don't get it, not like I am gonna do something horrid to him.  Just asking for coffee one night, maybe dinner and a movie sometime, not asking for a commitment, cripes! Then, the man blew my mind, he asks me if I am going to the bookstore again.  I told him I would be there after class on Wednesday.  He asked if it would be ok if he met me there.  I told him to come on over, I'd be the one in the coffee shop doing her homework.  We shall see, not holding my breath.  Oh and as for Tommy....nope never called, such a blowhard!

      What has Halloween become?  Halloween is now over for all the little ones, the 8 o'clock curfew has come upon them.  I didn't have one child come to my door, which was fine.  I don't need to see the little rugrats dancing in front of me begging for a candy bar.  What gets me, is the ones that don't even try to dress up.  What is that all about?   I remember, even as a young teen, dressing in whatever I found in my dad's or brother's closets and going all out.  Trying to come up with the craziest costume anyone ever thought up.   These kids I saw walking the streets today didn't even try.  There were kids just in regular clothes and to be honest, they are the ones that scare me to most.  It totally freaks me out that a 14, 15 or 16 year old kid, will knock on my door, ask for candy or money or even my stereo and you know what?  I'd give it to them.  I am afraid that kid will come back and get me and do something to my car, or my house or even me.   Maybe I am just a scaredy-cat, but ya know what.  I will take a mob of Freddies and Jasons and I will even let Michael into my house.  But you knock on my door wearing a white T-shirt and black jeans and I will scream my head off! I am glad I kept my lights off....whew!

      1. What's the worst candy you've ever gotten on Halloween? Black licorice, YUCK!  2. What is your best comfort food? Lately it's been Mashed potatoes, with lots of butter and  urlLink cheese ....Ohh, I said cheese {I crack myself up}  3. When was the last time you tried a new vegetable or fruit and what was it? I tried an Artichoke at the last shrimp boil I went to.  All spicy and I figured out that I like Artichokes, they are your friend.  4. Is there a dish your mom or dad made for you growing up that you hated and can't even stand to think of now? When I was a kid, my mother would make Liver and Onions.  The stench would permeate the neighborhood, making the kids run for their lives.  I still can not stand the smell.  5. What's your favorite snacking food?  Nacho's....with melted cheese...Oh, I said  urlLink cheese  again..heheheeee!

      Another Mac Guy, who is new to Blogger world, started up today and of course posed the following question: Have you ever been involved with someone and then their best friend hits on you? How do you handle that? Do you just ignore it? Tell your other half and hope they believe you?   My answer is yes I have been there and told the significant other. I was engaged to be married a year ago and we, my fiance and I, went to a bar that he and his friends were regulars at.  He wanted to introduce me to his friends and hang out.  Great! Anyway, we had been there a couple hours and one of fiance's friends, his best friend as a matter of fact, came over to me and said I would have a better time with him than my fiance.   I laughed, I thought it was a joke.   We left and I really didn't think much of it, except flattered, cuz the friend is/was 24 years old.  Well, some how the guy got my phone number and I would get calls all hours of the day, mostly hang up calls, but annoying none-the-less.  After a few weeks of it, I told my fiance.  Of course he did not believe me, so one night the fiance was over my house, a night he usually wasn't and the phone rang.  I told him to look at the caller-ID and who's name was on it....Tah Dah!  Well, he went and talked to the guy, the guy blamed it on me, of course, but at least it was over or so I thought. unbeknownst to me, the guy kept talking about me and this put a strain on our relationship.    We ended up breaking up, but at least I know I was true and I was honest.  In a relationship, if you want it to last, you have to be honest.

      What sign are you?   Aries: pushes the others aside to get to the door first.   Taurus: will only eat the finest of Swiss chocolates.   Gemini: goes around the neighborhood once, changes costumes and  goes around again.   Cancer: stays at home and gives candy to the other trick-or- treaters.   Leo: plans their costume for months, then won't go out because  someone else had the same idea.   Virgo: wears a neatly-pressed suit and tells everyone they're a  bookkeeper.     Libra: is still standing in front of the closet trying to decide  on a costume.   Scorpio: isn't in it for the candy.   Sagittarius: will manage to wander to the next town.   Capricorn: makes a list of all the houses that give good candy and  the optimal route to take.   Aquarius: builds their costume out of spare flashlights and spends  all night tinkering when it shorts.   Pisces:: skips the whole thing to compose poetry to the Moon.     And I thought it was normal to keep a list of all the houses that had awesome decorations and gave lots of goodies.

      In reading my Horrorscope this morning, it told me that I may be passing by some fun.  That it may be right in front of my face.    Below is the Yahoo Horrorscope: *Do some sort of check of yourself in which you re-evaluate what exactly it is that you are working for, Vixie. If it is fun and relaxation that you are after, maybe you are actually passing it by without even realizing it. The fun you seek is right there in front of your face, and it would be best if you take advantage of it now instead of waiting until some magic hour at which point you feel you have earned it.  Hmmmmmm, depends on your definition of fun.  Below is an Instant message I recieved shortly after I read my Horrorscope: (Please note that the screen name has been altered to protect the guilty)  looneytunes: you are beautiful  vix: excuse me......lol looneytunes: was searching new orleans profiles, came across yours, saw your pic, think you are beautiful vix: thank you looneytunes: you are welcome looneytunes: i am 6'2" 205lbs athletic brown hair blue eyes vix: and.... looneytunes: married and playing{devil face} ...not hiding it looneytunes: want to see my pic  He sent two....one of himself and one of "himself".  After a few more minutes of, "awwww come on, have a romp with me!" He figured out I wasn't in the mood for the sneaking around, Blah! I really don't think the Horrorscope meant that kind of fun.  Dang, what ever happened to "hey baby, can I take you to dinner?"

      He was there again last night. In my dreams. I always dream of him so vividly. I know his scent. I know his texture. I know his taste. He fills me. He intoxicates me. He wants me.  His eyes are so piercing. His hands demanding. Always slow and sensual, building to such a heated passion that is consuming.  And then I wake, and he was never there, and never will be....but in my dreams.

      Mr. Fix-it had called yesterday and asked to see me after my class, but by the time the class was out, I really was feeling like crap. I called him to tell him that, first, I really didn't want to go over to his place and second, I was feeling bad. He begged and pleaded, saying he just wanted to cuddle and he missed me so much.  Finally, I relented and told him I would come over to cuddle, but no sex.  He claimed I would change my mind. I get there a few minutes later and he is all over me, drooling on me, hands pawing at me and grabbing at my skirt.  I batted his hands away and told him I would leave if he kept it up. I told him I just wanted to lay down and if he was gonna cuddle with me, then he better get at it.  I crawled up on the bed and closed my eyes, he pulled me in his arms and he kissed my forehead.  I guess I started to doze, cuz I am not sure how it started, but his hands were climbing up my skirt and he was kissing my neck.  I told him to stop, that I wasn't up to it, but he kept it up.  The next thing I knew I was on my back and he had me pinned under him.  I felt a small panic attack start to form in the pit of my stomach.  I felt pain in my hips where he had his hips grinding on me, I felt him crushing the breath out of me.  I am trying to think and all that keeps coming to mind is that if he wants to have sex with me there is nothing I could do.  I knew I was not strong enough to get him off me.  All of a sudden I stopped thinking and I went limp, I just laid there staring at the ceiling, knowing there was nothing I would be able to do and he was kissing my neck and biting at me, telling me how I make him crazy, probably thinking I am loving all of it, but then he isn't getting any kind of reaction, so he stops.  He looked at me and said, "Why you laying there?  It's like kissing a mummy".  So in a firm voice I said, "Get off me, you are hurting me".   He did stop, and he scooted lower down my body and hugged me.  The panic went away and I found myself so tired.  Exhausted.  He climbed up next to me and pulled me into his arms and hugged me tight.  I wanted to go home.  I finally did get up, I put on my shoes and he walked me out.  He hugged me, told me to get some rest and he said he would call me.   In my car, as I rounded the turn-around at the end of the street, the memory was a different one.     I was running behind the school, chasing after Eddie cuz he stole 20 bucks from me.  I just crossed the basketball court and the wind got knocked out of me.  I was flying across the grass, my knees were stinging and I was disoriented.  Then I was grabbed by my hair and yanked to my knees.  He realized he couldn't open his pants and hold my hair at the same time, so he pushed me to the ground and ripped my shirt.  I think I screamed "No", but it could have been in my head.  I tried to push him off, but he kept coming at me.  He couldn't get my jeans off, I was squirming around too much.  So instead he straddled my chest and opened his pants, he tried to open my mouth, he slapped me and pulled my hair.  But I wouldn't open.  I didn't care if he hurt me.  And then it was over, he had completed his task.  He ejacked all over my face, hair and chest.  He sat there for a minute, maybe more, maybe less, then he chuckled, zipped up his pants and he was gone. I laid there and cried.     I went home after that, I was met at the door by my best friend, she followed me up to my room, she helped me take a shower and bandage my scrapes.   She never asked what happened, she knew.   She never asked who did it, but I knew.   I got home and was just climbing into bed and my phone rang.  Mr. Fix-it wanted to make sure I made it home ok.  He must have noticed my voice was shaky or something, cuz he asked if I was alright.   I said No, and good-night.  I hung up after he said he would call me in the morning.  I didn't sleep very good, I kept remembering and this morning I still remember, but it's ok.   I am OK.

      The concert was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My chica and I left for Biloxi around 2pm.  I wanted to get there early enough, first to get a good parking spot and second to have something to eat.  We had a snack at "Charley's" and a couple beers and when we got to the Coliseum, I was put in a front row parking space, sweet! Another bonus, the line to get is wasn't very long and before we knew it we were in.  I had originally thought we were in the Mosh Pit, but we weren't.  Instead we were seated about 50 feet from the stage, in the center, 6th row.  The only thing between us and the stage was the pit and the sound man. About a half hour later the first intro band started to play.   "3 Days Grace" I think was the name.  Don't know who they are and I don't want the CD.  Totally head-banging, loud, noise.  The pit went nuts.  Bodies start to float across hands and the security is plucking the idiots off and telling them not to do that.  The more the security plucked them off, the more they kept at it.  After a song or two my chica turns to me and asks, "Is this Nickelback?".    Ohhhh my!  I thought she was kidding when she said she didn't know who they were. {Groan}  Well, they finally finish and the next band started up.  "TRAPT".  I again was not familiar with this band.  The pit again goes nuts and the bodies start to float again.  I am nervous for these people, mostly because the idiots are getting dropped and it's not carpet down there, it's concrete.   Personally, I will pass on being dropped from at least 6 feet on my head.   Then all of a sudden it looks like there is a freakin brawl going on down there.  The people opened up and a circle formed.  The next thing we knew they were pushing each other and not coy little shoves either.  They were literally whipping each other around, slamming into each other, knocking other people down, punching and trampling each other.  Then everyone would stand up and they would jump around and do some sort of dance.   Security took care of a couple of them, picking them up and carrying them out.  "Kicked out" kind of carried out.  I just don't understand it, I go to a concert to listen to the music, dance and have a good time.  These people thought it an honor to be tossed out.    (Like here's 45 bucks man, now pick me up and toss me out, duh, huh huh huh, Man that was cool!) Whatever!  The last song that TRAPT played I had heard on the radio, don't remember what the song was now, but it was good and no, I'll pass on that CD too.  Nickelback! When they came on stage, everyone went wild, yes, even me.  On the feet, and jammin.  Chica turns to me and yells in my ear, "I know them!"....I just smiled at her. The next two hours was spent screaming, singing, clapping, waving my hands, dancing and just plain enjoying the show.  Fireworks, loud booms, smoke and fire.  Awesome! Nickelback CD's....yes, they are on my Christmas list.  I got home about quarter after 1 in the morning and probably didn't fall asleep til about 2.  What a concert!!

      I am off to a concert.   urlLink Nickelback  in Biloxi, MS. - Mississippi Coast Coliseum, Rock on!!  This weekend, I was asked what I was doing today by a fellow classmate (he wants to get together and work on a paper, for real!). Well, when I told him I was going to a concert, he looked at me and said, "Aren't you a little old to be getting all excited and moshing at a concert?"  At first I was offended, then it occured to me, he, at 29, had no life...and then I felt sorry for him. It is a very sad thing when someone so young acts so old. I have no clue where I am going with this....just wanted to say....  I am going to a concert!!! Whoo hoooo!!! Eat your heart out!!!

      I answered the 7th call.  Yes, I answered the phone.  The first words out of his mouth were, "Are you mad at me?"   Nahhhh, I am turned on by waiting for a call back! He apologized, he explained he was really busy.  I told him, ....if you say you are gonna call back, do it!  If you can't then don't say it.   He begged to see me tonight, I said no.  Even if I didn't have plans, I would have said no.  I don't want to be the part-time girlfriend, when it is convenient for him.  I am a person, I have feelings and I don't deserve being treated like crap.  He'll figure it out and if he doesn't, I'll find a new one.

      I ended up at the VFW last night.   Just me and my mom. Mom kept my wine glass full and we sat there, all teary eyed, reminiscing about Gram and kids and life. We made a packed that we will go back to the Cape and get a stone for Gram's grave, which we have been bad to not get one so far.  We even talked about going to Ohio and rescuing Aunt Gloria from the hell she is in.  Like two drunken fools could rescue anyone. I am not sure what time it was when I left, not even sure what time it was when I got home(Bad, very bad!).  I do know I turned on my computer and I do know I dialed Mr. Atlanta.   I need to call him later and apologize. I remember crying, I remember blowing my nose alot, and I remember tell him I loved him. This is why you don't drink and dial, you don't remember everything you said. Anyway, I think I said goodnight, and when I woke this morning...Oh, my aching head....I was still drunk.   I did notice this morning that I had a voice message, upon checking, apparently I had a message from the previous night that I had saved.  Mr. Fix-it decided to call after all.  He called at 10:15 last night and again this morning at 5:30.  Did I call him back?  No, at least I don't think I did.

      Last night I had originally planned to go to the "Spanish Festival" with my little Spanish Chica, but I just wasn't feeling up to crowds and standing around.  Plus I was tired, I did domestic all day and I even washed my car and Armor-all'ed the interior{Whats up with that?}.   Anyway, when she called I bowed out and told her we would get together another time. Not long after that, Miss J called and filled me in on her adventures of the day.  Practicing on her bike and even laying it down, in a not so gracefull manner, and getting scratched up.  She was in the mood to boogie and wanted company.  I declined, but thanked her. Feeling like I wanted to stay home, watch a movie, maybe have a glass of wine or two, I called Mr. Fix-it.  I told him I was going to be in and would like to get together.  He said sure, and that he would call me when he finished work. I did a little more house cleaning, took a shower and did some reading.  At 10 o'clock, maybe a little earlier, I put in the movie.  By the time it was over, I was sitting on the couch in tears.   urlLink Two weeks notice  isn't a tear jerker movie.  So why was I in tears, I was alone.  Again, I had wasted my weekend waiting on someone that says he wants to be my boyfriend.  Well, ya know what, not again....I really am sick of being taken advantage of, I am sick of being the one waiting around.  No more wasted weekends for this girl.  Gonna save the rest of the time I have, filling up the gas tank and heading West....I'll let you know where I ended up.

      Though I started out today thinking I was going to post something of total fantasy, I realized it was not because I wanted to do it, it was because I am wanting to hide.  Hide from the world, my reality and just wait till the storm I have created dissipates to nothing and it's safe to go outside again. The storm being the inner turmoil I have over where I have taken my life in the last few weeks and days.  I have let my studies fall behind, mostly because I am so angry at the school for not giving me a credit for a dropped class.  I just have my panties in a bunch about paying for a class twice and only getting it completed once.  They say rules are rules, too bad.  I say fine, keep your rules, bite my ass, I am out of here!  Grrrrr!  Then there is the homefront, my son had been jerking me around about moving down here so I have been trying to take it all in stride.  Well, he finally said yes to a plane ticket, he is selling all his crap, and he will be here the 22nd of November.  I have no idea where he will sleep, though my mother thinks he is staying with her.  She is going to have a cow when she finds out he has no inclination to stay at her house.  Then my daughter.  I have no idea what to do with her.  One day she is moving to New Hampshire, then it's Colorado, then she is staying on the Cape, then she blows my mind and says she might move down here with me.  Lord, make up your mind, I can't afford it anymore!   Then there are men, there are always men.   Today I don't want any of them.  They are driving me crazy.    In one corner I have "Him".  He's not gonna like this and ya know what, Too bad!  He is driving me nuts.  I am having a really hard time with the happy-hyper mood.  I am not like that.   I like mellow.   I like chillin out.   I am not a chatty-Cathy.   I just can't do it, I am sorry but it's just not me. If you need the bubbly, chirpy, chittery chica you will have to go someplace else and to be honest I am not looking for that type in my life either.  Then in the other corner I have Mr. Fix-it.  He is all gung-ho about jumping in the sack with me.  He spread compliments like butter.  But then he forgets he says things, like how I get under his skin and how he likes me with him and we will do this and we will do that.  When I call him on it he denies it and backs up like the "little boy coward" he is.  He will call for a few day in a row, make me feel something and "BAM", I won't hear from him for a few days.  Total emotional rollercoaster.  LET ME OFF! It's makin me dizzy!  I think I am pickin up a bottle of vino on my way home from class tonight.....Kids, I am coming to work tomorrow with a hangover!

      I totally blew it.  My first Mid-term and I think I flunked.  I have no idea what happened, ohhh well I have a couple ideas, but still, I studied.  A lot.  A couple hours on Saturday, an hour or so on Sunday, 4 hours on Monday and 3 1/2 hours before the test.  I sat down, the "Hunky One" handed out the test, I took one look and I was completely blank.    I am thinking to myself, "I read about this?"  "This was in the notes?" Honestly, I guessed on at least half of the questions. I blew it and have been swearing to myself since last night.  What could have happened?  I have a couple possibilities: My brain is too dead. I don't have the ability to retain information about how American Government works. I was asleep when I thought I was studying. Sex withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal. Other stuff on my mind, like work. Men. All of the above.  Damn.

      I was in Kiln, Mississippi this past Saturday night visiting friends.  (I ended up crashing a big ho-down band, food, people and lots of rain.)   The real intention was to drop off some pics and have a beer or two and head home.  The next thing I knew the band had finished and we were heading to the bowling alley in Diamondhead to go dancing.  Ok, I am up for pretty much anything and I was really surprised.  The place was packed and the music was descent.   We danced some and after a few songs I decided to sit out for a few and do some people watching: and now the reason for this post.  While standing by the bar, sipping on a beer, I was assaulted repeatedly by unsolicited advances from a wide range of Diamondhead/Kiln/Mississippi swamp rat men.  Some made me laugh and some pissed me off.   The following are a sampling of the pick-up lines that were laid on me:  A short man came up to me and was staring at my chest.  He pointed and said, "Are those real or are they that silicone stuff?" When I said they were real, he asked if he could touch to see for himself.  Answer, NO!  Another short man can up to me and asked if my Tattoo was new, when I replied yes he got a grin on his face and asked, "You want me to set that ink for ya?" he then raised his hand as if to slap me on the back.  My quick reply to him was, "You like yer teeth in yer mouth?"  A very tall man was burning the butt of my jeans and I felt warmth so I turned and caught him. He smiled and said, "Just checking to see if it's as sensitive as it looks." This asswipe was standing next to his wife while he was burning holes in the ass of my pants, ewwwww.  And the one that took the cake.....this guy was really goodlooking, Hubba Hubba, he walks over to me and we start talking.  He asked if I was new in town, blah, blah, blah.  I explained I was visiting friends.  Anyway after a few minutes he leans over and whispers in my ear, "The wife is a traveling nurse and she is away til Monday.""Ya wanna come stay with me?"  I perked up my eyebrow and laughed.  When I stopped laughing I said one word....NO, and walked away.  I have come to the conclusion I am a magnet for jerks, married men, and total retards, though I must say, I can at least laugh about the entire thing.  They are definitely everywhere and guaranteed to put a little excitement in your weekend.  Heheeeee

      Saturday, I drove to Biloxi to get my  urlLink tattoo  and unfortunately I forgot about the  urlLink cruisin the coast  event.  Let me say this, I left my house at 1:30 and I finally got to the shop at 5:40. (It's only a hundred miles)   I was over heated. I was grumpy. I was tired. And I was craving mass quantities of beer. Tom did wonders, he calmed me with his soft voice, and I eventually dozed off in the chair as he "Inked" me.  The man is a master and as usual he made a beautiful piece of art on my back.  I can't wait till the next one.  Heheeee

      Ohhh my, where to begin?  Alright we will start with "Him", he left me two messages last night, while I was out shakin my bootie.  He said he saw the phone empty and took advantage of the opportunity.   Nice to be missed.   If you don't know he is presently about 150 miles out(offshore), on a ship with about 180 other people(mostly male children, ranging in ages between 20 to 50 years old).  He told me he sent me an E-Card and an E-Mail and hoped I was having a good time. This morning when I came into work, I read the card and mail.  Cute card, I like Garfield, he is a cool cat.(This does not mean to go Garfield crazy, I collect Teddy Bears and I don't need anymore of them either)   I had a meeting and when I got out the phone was ringing.  It was him.  He kind of ragged on me about not being there to answer his calls today, which I explained I was actually working.  Then he said he waited for my call yesterday afternoon.  Hmmmm, I don't believe I said I would call, but ohhh well, sorry if I did.  My mistake. Anyway, we chatted a bit, I told him I had decided I was getting my Moon Tattoo, even if I couldn't afford it right now.   He offered, but with a condition.....sweetie, I did names before, and guess what, you ain't getting your name on my body, anywhere, ever...and if you become a pest about it, "SEE YA!"  Today is not a good day to think about personal issues, I am in a "Don't give a crap" mood.  You don't like me doing this, then get out, Peeshhhh! But, today I have been thinking.   Analyzing.   Asking myself the usual questions, like "Is this what I want?", "Where is this going?", "Do I like this?".  And my conclusion....I am exhausted.   My mental balance has been tilted, and I don't like it.  It is not a pleasant feeling, it is actually making me angry.  I have come a long way in order to achieve peace, order, and stability.   I like quiet, I like harmony....and I am not getting it. I had gotten myself absorbed in the idea of what the capabilities are and not sat and figured out if I am really interested in the possible capabilities.  I fear that during this entire process, I forgot about me.   I was so wrapped up in the him in the story, I really did forget about the me.  I don't like this, don't want it......Crap, can I have a Martini now?  This post went to Hell in a hand-basket quick, didn't it?

      I have spoken with "Him" a few times today, he calls me 3 or more times a day.   Mostly to say "Hello baby".    I am not complaining, I am just not used to all this attention.  He knows this and, yes, it sometimes makes him angry that I am in doubt of his real feelings.  It's not that I have a doubt as to how he feels, it's just that those feelings of inadequacy, the insecurity, the lack of confidence that I have in myself (that I hide very well, thank you) make me feel I am undeserving of his praises.  He tells me not to base "us" on my past.  That I should look into the future.  I understand the concept, but the memories and conditioning are difficult to just drop, to be free of it.  I am a product of my environment and even when I changed my environment, my history stayed with me.  It is part of me.  I am slowly dealing with my issues, developing the me that I like.   The sassy girl that I know I am, not the Girl-Interrupted that I was a long time ago.  He says he will be there for the long haul, he says no matter what he will always be my friend.  He wants to take care of me, to fix me and make me whole again.  He wants to hear me smile as well as see it.    You know what, this scares the living crap out of me.....it really does.

          The Tattoo dude,  urlLink "Tom" , that Miss J turned me on to, has known I was coming on the 11th to get my new Tat done for weeks.  I called today and he is really booked up, like he might have an hour to spare kind of booked.    I have to call back tomorrow to find out for sure.  If it turns out that he does not have time to give me, I will reschedule....he is definately worth the wait.

      "Husbands need sex, and it's a wife's job to provide it - as much as he wants, whenever he wants it."   Not from my mouth, but from Dr. Laura's.  I had respect for this woman...operative word..."Had". Then I read  urlLink this .    So sorry, "Doctor", but relationships are a two-way street, if a man thinks I am going to praise him for "The Gift" he thinks he is and to lay there and take it, as good or as lousy as it may be, WRONG!   A woman has the right to be treated as a gift as well, to be pleased sexually, completely. A woman doesn't need to be nagged at, whined to or nitpicked. Give me a break....  Making her husband her No. 1 priority...Ha! What about her? Where is she on the priority pole, down there with the dog?  Respecting him accordingly...What about her respect, what about self-respect? Men have affairs because they're afraid of intimacy...Bullshit!  People have affairs because of the thrill and they think they will get away with it. Ha..Haha..HA!

      I woke this morning lazily, stretching like cat.    I could feel the warmth of a body next to me, his hand gently gliding up my hip and he grabs me and hugs me to his chest.  He moans in my ear as he plays with my nipple, still sore from last nights rough encounter.  His hand splays its way down my stomach to the tangle of curls, they are damp and I am ready for him, though sore and swollen.  He takes care and is gentle with me, slow and loving.  Whispering in my ear, telling me how good I make him feel. Inside me, he grows bigger and his heat is becoming unbearable, I can't take anymore.  My hips adjust and I take him deep inside, welcoming his climax meeting mine.   We lay there, connected, sweat dripping and mixing, he kisses my forehead, my cheeks, my neck and gentle withdraws leaving me with a sense of emptiness.    I roll over and look at the clock and with a girlie chuckle I say, "See, I told you you were going to be late."  Hmmmmmm!

      Today started out like all the other Sundays I have been having lately.  Sleeping til noon, laying around in my jammies till the day was almost over, but this Sunday for some reason I got motivated. I took a quick shower and grabbed a couple bottles of water and hit the road.   Stopped at the store and bought a map and headed West.  I had no destination in mind, no time limits. Just me, "Boney James", and a full tank of gas.   (I bought the map in case I got lost) So I cruised I-10, turned off on I-310, drove over the Luling Bridge and the next thing I know I was in LaRose and getting hungry.  Not knowing the area, and since I was driving alone, I thought it best to head back. The two hour drive (there and back) turned into an all day trip, but it was beautiful and peaceful.  I feel absolutely wonderful.  I pulled off the road and gazed at the scenery.  The birds and the fish jumping in the bayou's.  The weather was fabulous, warm with a light breeze, sun shining, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day.  I can't hardly wait til next weekend when I get a chance to venture out and see more of this wonderous place that I call home.

        "You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss". Your romance is Casablanca. A classic story of love in trying times, chock full of both cynicism and hope. You obviously believe in true love, but you're also constantly aware of practicality and societal expectations. That's not always fun, but at least it's realistic. Try not to let the Nazis get you down too much.    urlLink   What Romance Movie Best Represents Your Love Life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I finally got up the nerve to meet up with "him" Wednesday night.  Him being a man I started talking to a few months back.   It seems our relationship took a different turn in the last few days, we have become closer, more intellectually involved, parralleling each other, complimenting, very different for me.  I had a little study thingy after work Wednesday and he called to say hello, and he called again to ask me to call him when I was done.  The study thingy broke up and I stopped at my Chica's bar to have a cocktail.  While there, I gave him a call and asked him where he was.  I had been sitting there and it really hit me that in about 24 hours he would be going back to work and I would not have another chance to see him until he came back in 3 weeks, so I headed out to meet him when I finished my drink. It was about 8:30 when I picked him up, and we cruised the lakefront and talked.  The sweetie burned me a few CD's of Jazz, Wow, gifts, I like this.  I put one in my CD player and we listened to the smooth Sax of Boney James, it was wonderful.  We ended up at this hole-in-the-wall-dive of a bar, talking and listening to music.  Where the time went I have no idea, but before we knew it it was 11 o'clock and I had to work the next morning. As it turns out, I didn't get to sleep until 3am, Thursday was a hell of a day, but it was worth it, I learned so much about this man. He is a wonderful, caring, gentle man.   He is from my past.   Our souls have met before.   He is comfort in my tormented world.   He accepts me for who I am. He is my friend and always will be. Forever a part of me.

      Just when I had given up and decided that I wasn't going to do it anymore, he called.  I hear the deep rasp of his voice on the other end, "you know what kind of call this is?", I want to be mad, but the inner pull, the desire to be touched was overwhelming.   So I went, willingly.  He smells of soap and there is a hint of aftershave as he greets me at the door.  He takes my hand and leads me to his upstairs apartment.  I kicked off my shoes and sat on the bed, with intentions to chat for awhile, but he came up behind me and pulled me back on his lap.  We layed there as his hands explored my chest, arousing me, causing quiet mews to escape my lips.  Then, as quick as lightning, he was above me, undoing my dress, pulling off my panties, desperation in his eyes, we both were nude in seconds.  He came to me and he suckled my breasts and slowly kissed down my stomach.  His tongue danced in my belly button and before I knew what was happening he was sucking my clit and I was slammed into my first orgasm.  I grabbed at his shoulders and rammed his face down hard as I belted out a scream and my body shuddered.   He laughed at how easy I was to bring to climax, to which I countered it had been 6 days since he and I had been together. He kissed me deeply, his mouth was heavy with the scent and taste of me and Jack Daniels.  The passion building he kneed my legs apart and dove deep in my wetness, again bringing me to a screaming orgasm, though this time he didn't stop, he lifted my knees, deepening his penetration, in a position that had him hitting my G-spot and I was brought to the point of blackness, unable to see, hearing screams in the distance, air rushing through my lungs, heart beat in my ears.   I don't know when he stopped, I just became aware of him holding my face, asking if I was ok, to which I reply with a laugh,"I am fine, why?"  He nuzzed my neck and said, "Oh, darlin, we can never go to your house, you make to much noise, Damn!"  As we layed there still connected, he talked of how he was angry that I went to a lesbian bar, and squeezed the tight butt cheeks of one of the security guards.   He was jealous.   We actually argued while his hard cock was deep inside me.   Then he calmed and said I was right, he was not my boyfriend, I was not his girlfriend, we are fuck-buddies.   He said he understood.  He then proceeded to get harder.  He slowed his pace, though he became more demanding.  It felt like flames were igniting, the sweat rolling off us, and with one last rush, he was spent.   He held me for a long time, nipping at my neck, and cooing as lovers do.    I really hope he does understand, I would hate to lose what we have just because he fell for me and wants me as his girlfriend.   Cuz I am not ready for that and probably never will.

      This week's  urlLink Cheddar X !   1. What's the funniest town name you've ever seen?  Being a military brat and living in a bizilion towns, a funny name doesn't really come to mind.  But when I tell people where I was born I usually get a few raised eyebrows.  I was born in Bourne, yup...and the hospital was torn down to make way for a National cemetery.     2. What was the last museum you went to?  Would Stone Mountain in Georgia count? No? Then it would have to be.....Ohhh my, Ummmm, I think the Museum of Modern Art in New York, gosh that would be like 20 years ago.  Sorry, I have been corrected, The Smithsonian in 1989   3. When was the last time you were grossed out?   It really takes alot to gross me out.  The worst I have ever seen was down in the French Quarter, Labor Day weekend 2002...ya'll know what happens then, and I won't go in a circle again!   4. What is the best blog title you've come across or made up on your own?  There are so many great blogs out there, it is too hard to choose just one.     5. Do you live in your hometown now? What caused you to stay or move away?  I don't live in my hometown anymore, mainly because I didn't feel like it was home anymore.  All of my family had either moved away or passed away.  As soon as my daughter graduated (and after asking her if she wanted to move, to which she said no) I sold what I could and moved south.  Better job opportunities, family closer, and I didn't have to see the ex's anymore, Yey!   6. If you were a criminal mastermind, how would you take over the world?  I would make everyone my sex slaves!  Bwahahahahahahaaaaaa! Seriously, if the chance to take over the world fell in my hands, people be afraid, I can't even balance my checkbook!

      {Sigh}  R stopped by to spread a little holiday cheer and he left a very, very happy woman behind. This man is wonderful.  I probably shouldn't, but I hold a part of me aside, I am waiting for the other "shoe" to drop.  He is how I would wish a perfect man to be. He is attentive. He is compassionate. He is considerate.  And sometimes, I wonder....how come I am so lucky that he found me and I found him.  Don't get me wrong, I know I deserve to be treated in this wonderful way.  It's just after being treated badly and pretty much giving up that "he" was out there, R walked into my life and to be honest, he has just blown my mind.  {sigh} Happy me is off to bed, sleep!  I have guests for dinner tomorrow. I am going to cook up a storm, drink too much wine and bask in my glow.

      I had forgotten how much work goes into Turkey day prep.  I can say thou, tomorrow will be a breeze now, since I dug all the china, flatware and glassware out, cleaned it all and put it out on the table. The floors are vaced, cleaned and the downstairs bath is nice and shiny.  While I was home scrubbing and baking pumpkin pies, my brother went out and got a tree.  I am flabbergasted that he did something so festive all on his own.   The boy has grown up....bwahahahahahaaa!  I am not going to ask, complain or anything...I am just thankful I didn't have to do it by myself again this year.  Well, if I don't get to post later tonight...  Ya'll have a Happy Thanksgiving!

      It was brought up today that thru life you will always have a "first".  This made me think of my firsts. My first love, who I shared my first kiss with, was who I thought of.  His name was Curtis.  I was around 8 years old and he was about a year older than me.  He and his family, his Mom and Dad, his brother Greg and their dog Tiny lived in the apartment on the corner, diagonal from our apartment. He would walk me home from school, holding my hand and we would giggle all the way. His family and mine were close friends and we would be over each other homes every weekend.  Dinners and card games for the parents and us kids watching TV or playing board games or hide and seek.   I remember his mom and mine discussing wedding plans, to which I found out years later the plans were for Curtis and I.  One day we were all playing hide and seek...Curtis and I, his brother and my two and Curtis pulled me into an alcove.  He grabbed my hand and puckered up.  I leaned in and we pecked lips, as 8 and 9 year olds that is all we knew.  After that we were known around the apartment building as going steady.  A year later Curtis and his family moved away.  I was young and from a military family, this was normal, so no real tears were shed and I got on with my life.  When I was 13, my parents told me that there was a surprise trip.  We drove to Dale City, a few hours from where we were living, and who met me in the driveway?  Curtis.  He was grown and tall and handsome and it was like we had never been separated.  He grabbed my hand and walked me into his house and we went to his room.  We sat there for hours and talked and talked.  We laughed and laughed and if the brothers tried to come in the room we would both yell for them to get out.  I heard my mom call my name and I knew it was time for us to go.  Curtis hollered down that I would be there in a few.  He put on the Boston album and he leaned over and he kissed me. I felt his tongue against my lips and I opened.  He explored my mouth and to be honest it was gross.  I had never kissed a boy like that before.   But also, when we parted and I wiped the wet off my chin and I looked into his eyes, I knew he was my love.  We saw each other a few more times after that, but as we grew up, we knew that it would never work.  We lived too far apart. His kisses did get better and my love for him grew.   I hope he grew into a fine man.  Today I know him as my first love......hmmmm, ain't love grand!

      I talked to R a few hours ago, he is on a detail(shhh, he is a policeman) and he asked for me to come by to visit with him. He wanted to see my new haircut, I had about 2 inches chopped off on Friday and since he has been sick I have not seen him. His reaction was, "you had it cut?"  I told him that when he was feeling better he would be able to tell when he ran his finger thru it.....Ohhh, I can hardly wait, I tell ya, it gives me tingles. Anyway, we stood outside and talked and as we talked and said the same things, ideas, fantasies, dreams, wishes and then, I was looking at him and I have no idea how it happened.   I saw someone I want to be with for a very long time.   Who is this man? How did he get under my skin so fast?  I told him, "Ya know, you are glad you found me." He said, "Booboo, we found each other."

      I was going to hit the grocery store today and pick up the necessary items for Turkey day, but instead I hung out with my son.  We went over to the Grandparent's house and then the Auntie's house.  To which son commented to me later, Ya know mom, Manda is getting fat, I can't believe you actually told her to her face.  Son's Aunt, my sister, is due with her first child in 17 weeks or so, and I am loving it that her ass is getting huge!  Ohhh, don't get your panties in a wad people!  These are words of endearment, I swear.  Then we did go to Albertsons and picked up soda, and then hunger won out and we went to the "Asian Super Buffet".  Son was in his glory, where else can you feed a 6'6", 270 pound, 18 year old with a hollow leg for $8.95.  There are 5 or more buffet centers, piled high with what ever your heart desires of Asian food.  He had three plates I think, patted his tummy and cried uncle.  Of course this did not get me any closer to finishing my intended project, but I picked thru the flyer and made a list.  Tomorrow will be shopping day, I hope.

      Ohhh, what a day!  My day started with a talk on the phone with my new man. (New man will from now on be known as R.) R was supposed to call me yesterday eve, but I didn't get a call.  Earlier in the day I had told him, that if he and I could not get together I would probably end up at Rainbow.  R was pleased that I had alternative plans and told me that if I did, to have fun for him as well.  And as was told in my previous post the only one that could have possibly scored was  urlLink W .  Hurumph!!!! Anyway, R started off with an apology.  Apparently he became ill and ended up at his mothers last night, and I guess I don't have to go into details.  He is still feeling yucky, but went to work anyhow and self prescribed old antibiotics. (Fabulous!)  We bantered about when we would see each other again...but ended up I told him when he was feeling better. I was supposed to be going to a birthday party/house warming/get together/total mayhem, get drunk kind of party tonight and needed to shop still too, but my brother begged for a sitter for my 5 year old niece and I whimped out.  So, Caroline and I went shopping together, I tell ya, the girl can pick out panties in "Fredericks".  We hit the mall, Macy's, Fredericks, The Lagniappe Shop(Means "A little extra"), The Disney store, I said NO to The Hello Kitty store, then we went to Wally world, Pier One and K-Mart.  I was pleased with my finds, including a glass human, actual sized head.   That's right, I am the proud owner of a glass head.  Don't ask, it is just too cool! Hunger overwhelmed us, so we stopped at the Burger King and after 2 bites of her burger, Miss Caroline was asleep in the back seat of my car as I sped through the outskirts of the French Quarter, totally lost, on the phone trying to find my destination.   Whew, take a breath! We get to  urlLink Car's  and I have gifts in hand and what happens.  My niece steals the show.  She is blabbering like a person on speed(that's what a 20 minute power nap will do) and following Car and  urlLink Jenn  around like a little shadow.  I was so happy Caroline wasn't a total pest and she seemed to be having a good time.  We helped a bit with the decorating and then bid our good-bye's.  Caroline went up to Car and gave her a big hug and a big kiss on the cheek and then did the same to Jenn.  This totally amazed me, the child has to be bribed to hug and kiss Nana and Papa.  I guess they really impressed the child, go figure! We were on our way home and just before the Bonnebell exit was a massive wreck.  Glass, metal, fiberglass, chunks of engine parts littered three lanes of highway.  We were about 10 cars behind when the accident happened, so we actually witnessed the drivers getting out of their cars.  No blood, no bodily injuries that were visible, but the SUV was totaled and the sedan....at least I think it was a sedan? was, well...there wasn't a passenger side left.  Me and Caroline gawk at the sight, both of us saying "Cool" at the same time. We went to the park after we got home, did the tetter-totter....don't laugh, it was fun! All in all, we had a really good time, even though I gave up the party tonight.  Caroline is a cool kid to hang out with once in awhile.  Later....8:45 pm, I picked up my son from the airport.  My son has moved to Louisiana, Yey! Mom and Dad stopped by to say hello to him, nag him about having a beard and all those other grandparenty things and left about 10.  Son and I then went to a local pool hall and played a few games.  I lost 3, he lost 4...hmmmmm, Mom still has it!  More tomorrow, I am beat...I wonder why?

      I am still amazed by the twist of events that occurred last night.  I met up with my friend W at a local girlie bar for some shaking of bootie and maybe a little action for me.   The band "Blaze" was playing great mellow type tunes and I must say the lead singer "Whitney" is one hot looking woman and what a voice she has.   Blaze took a break and the dance music blared from the speakers.  W and I were on the floor, dancing and out of the corner of my eye I saw him put his hand on the shoulder of this rather nice looking woman, we will call her Jane.  He leaned over and said something, Jane shrugged and spun over to her partner who was another woman.   What happened next is the twist part.  Jane's partner nodded at her and then she nodded towards W.  In that kind of nod that means go for it.  Well, thru the rest of the song and the next song too, Jane was boogying up to W, giggling to her partner and eyeing W like he was a medium-rare steak fresh off the BBQ grill. When W and I sat for a sec to catch our breath, I leaned over and said, "Hey, those women were flirting with you!"  He got this shit-eating grin on his face and said, "Yea, I know, isn't it great." Though this is a wonderful thing to happen to W.....my point is, we were in a girlie bar.  I wanted some too, damn it.

      Though this may be premature, I think I found a someone.  A someone that whistles at my butt as I walk by. A someone that looks at me when I talk to him. A someone that is quiet while I am talking. A someone that holds my hand, plays with my fingers and twists my thumb ring while watching a movie. A someone that runs his finger across my cheek before he plants a peck on my lips. A someone that tweeks my nose and makes me laugh. A someone that looks in my eyes and asks me if I am ok. A someone that calls me "booboo" and I like it.  Like I said, it may be premature.....but, I don't know...we will see.

      Ohhh, it's sweet!  I got a call while I was still working and I let it go to voicemail.  It appears Mr. Fix-it, finally fixed it. My Beetle has her Carb., aka her heart, back in her.   I ran over to my folks house and put the key in, after a couple failed attempts she finally started. She coughed and sputtered, she stalled and gasped, but after a few minutes she was revving up like the bitch I know her to be. I was so excited, (am still excited, it doesn't take a whole lot) I kicked her into first gear and had her in second as I rounded the corner.   Got her to 30 in a residential...kick ass!!!   You must understand, she has not done 30 in months, so this is like waking out of a coma to me.  She is bitchin.....I love this car..."Baby" definitely is back!  I know, I know, I still have to sell her...but, let me have this!! Damn it, she is a cool car!   How many people do you know own, love, dream about a '72 VW Beetle named "Baby"!?

      I know, I know....I am missing this beautiful cool day.  But, I was going though some papers the other day and I came across this huge pile of recipes.  I had a massive brainiac idea to put them all in the computer, print them out on fancy paper and make my own little cookbooks.   Then after I pretty them up I will give them to friends and family as Christmas presents......so, I took my shower and saw the pile of recipes and I started typing......well it's been 2 hours now and I am still here. I really hope the recipients of my labor realize the sacrifices I made to give them joy!  Ho, Ho, Ho!!

      I can't eat sliced Turkey and kosher pickles before I go to bed anymore.  I dreamed that I slept with that midget character from the HBO series "Carnivale".  What was really scary about it all, was I was mad he was cheating on me with the bearded lady.  No more eating before bed.......   I don't have to work today and I have found myself a little antsy.  I will probably end up going for a drive, try to get myself lost in this beautiful city, maybe stop and have a coffee on Decatur.  Fix-it called and left a message that he would put my Carburetor in today, he actually sounded sad.  Don't fret, he has no shot at all.  I have no plans on even being in town when he goes to my parents house.  Other than that....it's been a quiet start to my Saturday and I am liking it.  More later.

      I got home....hit the kitchen for some sliced Turkey and a couple pickles...harmless night snack food (come on, I hadn't had dinner yet)  I had my plate in hand and I was trying to make my way thru the dining area with the lights off and I bumped into a box. I thought, 1st...I almost lost my Turkey and 2nd....that box was not there when I left a few hours ago. I fumbled for the light and switched it on.  I bent over and behold...before my eyes is a TV box.   I read.   I put my plate on the table. I dashed to the livingroom.  Fuckin-A!!!!! Brother got a 32" Sylvania!!!!  Aren't promotions at the work place Fuckin awesome?  Sunday Football. Monday night Football, any Football....OK any TV related issue.......... at my place!!!!!!

      I went to the "Den" and ended up catching up with some friends.  Jenn showed, Yey!  So did a boy that had taken very good care of me last weekend in a time of need.   He played distant, he played little boy.  Ok, fine.  Jenn and I ended up going to "Legends" to shake some booty, leaving the boy at the Den.  I really enjoyed myself, I felt free and beautiful and sexy, all decked out in my 80's jeans, mustard shirt and sneakers.  Jenn flashin her Tats, and lookin way more sexy than I could ever be.  Fun, fun, fun...seriously!  We gave a hug goo-bye, promise to call tomorrow and headed to our separate homes. I was about 50 feet into my journey and my phone rang.  "Hey, where are you?"   Hmmmm, it was the boy.   I told him I had just left and I was on my way home.  He said, he was still at the Den and wanted me to come by.  I said, "You want me to come by?"  He said, "Yeah, I'll buy ya a beer."  I laughed and he then said................. "Yeah man, I gave her my card and I like don't have enough.  So my tab is like 28 dollars...Ohhh, and could ya stop and get 80 cuz I was playin pool."  I said, "Ya know...I ain't payin your tab.....I am going home, thanks though."  Yeah....Fucquad!

      It could be my personality. Or it could be I just know how to pick'em.  Stalker's, weirdo's and moron's.  If I can't find them, they find me.  Recently, it's Mr. Fix-it.  For someone that runs his own business, been thru two marriages and is the father of 4 children and a grandpapa of one that I know of, he is a really stupid man.  On Tuesday I told him that I did not want to see him anymore.(See Tuesdays post) Well, Wednesday morning at 5:21 am he called and left a voice message, "This is your wake up call".  Very strange I thought, a little late, I am thinkin, he is trying to get me back....I will ignore him. Wednesday night, I am out with friends....I left my phone in my car.  I get in my car later and see I have 2 missed calls and a voice message, From him.  Geez!  He wants to know what I am doing that night.  WTF! Thursday 5:02 am, I get another voice message, around 6 am I have a missed call.  By the time I left work, I had 3 more missed calls.  OK!  I have had it, is he stupid?  I call him up, I am pissed.  "Dude, what is your problem?" I ask him.  He is like all sweet and says, "Oh, how was your day?"   But then it turns into him asking where I have been, why haven't I returned his calls, who have I been hanging out with. I flat out said, "Well, first it's none of your business where I have been, but if you really want to know.  I have been hanging out in bars picking up young bucks, going back to their place and fucking their brains out!" He got all pissy, but then he thought I was joking and laughed.   Hey, I tried to be honest, it was actually only one bar and only one buck and his brains were gone before I even got there...so I was partly honest. Anyway....Mr. Fix-it asked if I didn't want to see him again.  I told him, that I didn't/don't want to see him.  That I am not his little hide-away girlfriend and to leave me alone. Get this....before I hung up he said, "Call me later"....call him later, yeah right, weirdo!  Why do I always find them?  Dang! I can say at least he wasn't the worst...and I have had worse.  The Mortician, who after 3 weeks, whispered to my (or what he thought was) sleeping ear "I Love You".  I waited till he was asleep and rolled away from me, then I ran out of the house nekkid.  He called for months, crying, whining, begging....demanding I was his "Soulmate".  I was a little freaked, but glad he didn't know where I lived.  The last time I heard from him was the weekend I went to Atlanta and Mr. Atlanta answered my phone for me.  My ex-fiance' B, he still can't shop at Sav-a-Center because it has too many memories of us.  Our break up was almost a year ago and he broke up with me.  The man-boy still calls my mother to see how I am doing and if I am ready to go back to him.    The Doctor, the one I followed to Iowa, I thought it was going to be this fabulous fresh start and be able to live the dream in the heart of the country.  After 3 months, I day-dreamed of walking into the woods and to never be found again.  I left him and moved to New Orleans.  10 days later he showed up at my mothers house on his knees, with a dozen red roses and a diamond engagement ring.  I almost said yes, but he started talking about how he was fixing up  his  house, starting  his  new company,  his  money and how I would pay rent and I would keep house and I would take care of him.  Ohhhh, thanks but no thanks.    The merchant Marine, after three weeks told his family I had said yes.  I was invited to dessert one evening and was floored by the question, "So, did you set a date yet?"  I found out later that he was going to buy me a house and he had inquired to doctors how a tubule reversal surgery worked and what the percentage would be for he and I to have a child.  I blew up at him.  He called and wrote for weeks.  Finally after a threat of a restraining order he stopped.  And there are more, so many they give me a headache.  Ughhh!  It really must be me, I am a magnet!

      "Are you breaking up with me?", "Well, you can't do that!"  Those were the words out of Mr. Fix-it's mouth this morning.   I told him that I was tired of being treated like I wasn't good enough for him. I told him I was better than that and I deserve better than him.  He agreed, but insisted we were not broken up.    I told him that in the past two months he has not done anything for me, ever!  I told him I was not waiting around for him to magically fix his life.  He said, "Baby, I just got a couple things to do, and then....."  I asked him when he would be at the shop tonight......  He said, "I got people there and my son is there and..."  I said, "My point exactly....I am tired of being hidden, I am better than that.  I am coming by to pick up my carburetor."  As I was hanging up the phone he was yelling, "No, you can't break up with me, I'll fix it, I promise!"  Oh, I promise this.....ain't going back again, they never change.

For all those men who believe that there's no reason to buy the cow when you can get the milk free,  nowadays, 80% of women are against marriage,  as they have wised up to the fact that for 8 oz. of sausage it's not worth buying the entire pig!

      Today should be a day of celebration. The rebirth of the moon last night after the eclipse, my reawareness of my inner and outer beauty, my strength that all say I have, and my fast approaching 1000th hit in just over two months.  Last nights eclipse was a sight to behold.  I stood outside and watched as the moon disappeared behind a shadow.  It wasn't the first time I had seen a Lunar eclipse, but that doesn't take away any of the awe.  It sort of puts it all in perspective.  And gives you pause as to what is real beauty. In the eye of the beholder, beauty is different to us all.  I have been fed lines that I am beautiful, only to be ignored, used, and even suffocated to the point of hatred.  This last week has had all three of those.   I am suffocated by Mr. Fix-it.  I can't even take his calls anymore, he repulses me.  I don't have the heart to tell him to go, maybe he will get the hint after awhile, but maybe not....it seems the more I ignore him, the more persistent he gets, go figure. And this week....I was used, then I used him too....But, hey....for a second I thought, and I think that was my mistake.  I thought there was something, cuz you don't call someone out of the blue, after you have moved away and beg to get together.  Would I have done it anyway, yeah , sure....he is a fireman after all.... Then there is ignored, that is the worst.....this happens more than all the rest.  You talk for weeks and the talks are intimate(not sexually, emotionally), there are promises made, and you get hope...and you feel special and beautiful and cared for, and then it's a day and then two days and 5 days and you don't hear from him, and you wonder what you did, which was probably nothing, it was just a game and you fell for it.  That emotional game and you lost.  And you don't feel so beautiful anymore. The game that picks at your strength and you feel vulnerable and alone and worst of all, worthless.  Yeah, nice game...... All in all, am I strong?  Sure, I am gonna dust myself off and jump back in, cuz that's what you do.  It's either that or curl up in a ball and watch chick flicks all night and sip chardonnay and go thru a box of Kleenex. Yeah, I am strong alright...  Happy 1000th hit!

         My attempt at a little humor, passion and biting commentary.....hmmm, Passion?  Biting? Yeah, Baby!!.....  1.  What good did you do in the world today?  I have not come up with the solution for abolishing poverty, starvation, or war, but....I made someone smile today.  Smiles make the world a happy place.  2.  What fashion trend are you glad that's gone away? Or what trend are you waiting to go away?    The blue swipe of eyeshadow above the eyes.  Ohhh that was gross.  And glitter, glitter everywhere, on the back, on the boobs, on the face, in the hair, ohhh  so glad it's gone. What, what did you say?  It's not gone? Who, what, where?  Ohhh, that's ok, they are from either Johnston, R.I. or Chalmette, LA.  Heheheeee!  3.  What's your greatest sports moment, your own or one you've witnessed?  My greatest sports moment.....It has to be when I played softball.  Ohhh, it was quite a few years ago.  Anyway, we were in the finals and needed to win this game.  I was in left field (I know, they put me there, I am not a great player, but I have fun, ok).  It was the 9th inning, we were ahead by 1. Well, guess what....there was a pop up, and it was heading my way.  I positioned myself under the ball, I saw it coming, I had my glove up and I was ready.  It was like floating and I could hear my teammates yelling for me to catch it.  I glanced up and the lights blinded me, I lost the ball and I moved my glove to try and find it.  Well I found it alright, square in the middle of my forehead.  I remember looking up and I couldn't figure out why I was feeling damp on my back.  I was flat on my back in the grass.  Though I did suffered a knot in the middle of my forehead, and somehow a black eye, we came thru and won the game. As you can tell, I am ready for the pros.  4.  Who would you nominate for the most annoying person award?  This list may be long, there are so many to choose from and I vote that they are placed on an island far, far away....cuz they bug the crap out of me! Kid Kradic in the morning-he is a radio jockey out of Baton Rouge, he is irritating and I don't listen to him anymore. Brittany Spears-Talk about dirty, skank, nasty! I am not yet a woman, bullshit.  Pull up your pants you slut! That guy on Trading Spaces Family-Who is he? He is not funny, he is lame. Get off the show, you bug me! That jerk that tried to run me off the road yesterday....you better have insurance asswipe! People that whine about something and don't do anything to change it...Shut up! and lastly, but not the lowest on my list....all you idiots that bitch about our country and how awful it is to live here....You know what, LEAVE!  We don't need you!  5.  What do you do to get yourself ready to write? Either blogging or other writing?   I masturbate! Yup! Relieves all that tension, makes me feel wonderful.  Helps me spew the afterglow!  6.  Mac or PC or Linux? Why?  PC...why?  It's free!  My brother-in-law helped me build mine and he gave me all the parts.  Free! Free! If you want to give me a free Mac, shit, I'll take that too. Free!

      I came home from work today and right about the time I was stuck on the Huey, I realized I was in a funk. I really didn't want to be with anyone.  Male or female.  I wanted to enjoy the quiet of my home, with no brother or niece.  No yelling.  No shrieking.  Just me and my kitties.  I entered my sanctuary and put on my Gar-animal nightie(lions and tiger and bears, ohh my!) and my fuzzy slippers(big fuzzy bears-shut up!).  I opened a bottle of wine(Alice White Chardonnay) and listened to a little Jazz(Boney James...ohh yeah!).  I talked to a friend online for a few minutes, ok maybe an hour, and I ignored a phone call. I said good night to my friend and popped in a movie.  urlLink i am sam .  Awesome.  I cried.  I laughed. I recommend this. To all that have been categorized as perfect or have all their shit together...you aren't..and you don't. I am a blubbering fool!

      I was wondering why all of a sudden I was feeling funky.  I took a look at my chart and Tah Dah...There is a  urlLink Lunar Eclipse  on Saturday.  Yey!  I will be out watching it, if it is viewable from my area.  Though I must warn you, this natural phenomenon happens at the time I start PMS'ing.  Don't say I didn't warn you.....be afraid!

      Warning!  The following post may be offensive to some people.  Read at your own risk.   Mr. Fireman met me at my house about 1.  I was so nervous my palms were sweaty and I couldn't keep still. He asked me to sit next to him.  All, I could see were his hazel/brown eyes and his thick lips.  He looked huge on my little couch, his long legs stretched out.  His big hand on my knee, his big feet casually crossed at the ankle.  He was talking, I am not sure what about, and I was thinking about the first time I met him.  How I am amazed he called me when he came to town this time.  Most of all, I was thinking of how good looking he is. Then he turned to me and kissed me, I was shaking and he asked if I was alright.   Ohhh, was I more than alright. I laughed and wrapped my arms around his neck.  We sat there kissing for the longest time, each one deeper than the previous.  He then stood up and took his shirt off. The sight was stupendous.  Muscled chest, taunt nipples, dark curls across his chest, narrowing down his belly and disappearing in a point down his pants.  He has two tattoos, one arm he has a Fire Department symbol, and the other arm he has a black panther.  I reached and touched, fascinated. I grabbed his hand and lead him out of the livingroom and to my room.  He finished undressing in front of me.  No words are spoken but he knew to lay down beside me so I can look.  He has two more tattoos, both on his calves.  One side is Fire department the other a Panther in the forest.  All have nice coloring and they accentuate his very muscular legs.   The man is built very well.  Even his manhood is impressive.  He is hung like a ...Yey!  Thick and wonderful. He slowly undressed me, and trailed kisses where clothes once were.  His hands were everywhere. He positioned himself over me and kissed me.  I felt him wanting to enter.  I was not sure what he is doing because he is kissing me deeper and I felt a slight push, I wanted him inside me.  I was feeling desperate and I was pushing against him.  He mumbled wait and then I know why.   He then impaled me with himself.   My tightness unfolded him, he groaned loudly in my ear and I was full.   Stretched and full, feeling his warmth everywhere.   His size was more than I expected.   The sensations were overwhelming and I was out of control.  He groaned again claiming if I didn't stop a second he would not be able to hold it together. I felt him grow larger inside me and I shifted, causing myself to spasm which was his undoing.  He screamed out my name as he himself spasmed.   The climax was explosive. When all quivers subsided, he leaned up, he kissed my mouth and then he asked if I was ok. Better than ok, I told him....yup better than ok. Talk about a smolder to inferno in 2.3 seconds.

      As far as I am concerned, my meeting is cancelled.  I have no need to be there even if it wasn't.  Plus, I can not concentrate on nothing except for the Fireman.  I am out of here!  I learned a long time ago, never turn down 6 feet 3 inches of hunk of burning man!  PS: I will write later!

      Ohhh my!!!  The Fireman's in town and I am speaking to him right now.  I may have a lunch date!    Ok...Lunch date is in limbo.  I have a meeting at 1.  Mr. Fireman said he didn't want just an hour of my time, so I am working on getting out of the meeting.  (Not by playing sick, that is just not me).  If it turns out that we can't see each other today, he is coming over my house on Wednesday for a movie and....and!    Ohhh, I missed the cute little fireman...it was a sad day when he moved away.  I am so glad he called me to let me know he was visiting.  Yey!!!!

      I ended up dressing up or should I say down and eventually went out with friends last night.  Me in a ankle length nightgown, hiking boots, way too much make-up and fake eyelashes(which everyone wanted to touch).  The Spanish chica, her dude friend Stew, Sab and Cass and I finally made it to the quarter about midnight.  Chica was an Alcoholic in prison garb, Sab was a little devil in her bikini top and cat-eye contacts and Cass was a dark angel. Stew was our pimp daddy in black.  After being stopped to get pictures taken by groping strangers (the twins will never be the same) and finding that just about every bar wanted a cover charge we headed back to Fat City. In Fat City we ended up at the Rainbow room. Yes, it had a cover too, but it was not crowded and we like the music and there was plenty of room on the dance floor.  Well, some of us, like Stew and myself, realized we had not be quenched....2 beers and a shot in the quarter....so he ordered a round of Vodka shots with a lemon on the side.   Surprisingly it went down smooth.   Dancing ensued.  Stew in his glory as 4 women were all over him, even with the known fact that two of them were a couple.   Over the next couple hours, beers were chugged, shots were downed in several different bars.  And then I looked at my phone for the time.  It was 6 am.   The sun was coming up.   You know what happens when that happens....when it's morning?   You realize you are drunk.   How did that happen?   Crap, I have to go to work in 4 hours....ohh crap!  Well, we took a cab home....Stew asleep on my lap...Chica asleep on my shoulder. Me, I was having Taxi Cab confessions with the driver. What did I confess, I am not gonna tell ya....but I will say, the Cab Driver wanted to walk me to my door.  Happy November everybody....It can only get better!

      I am loaded up. And I feel like I got run over by a Semi.  Monday I really thought this cold was over, but I woke up on Tuesday and By George I do believe I have relapsed. So here I sit, loaded up on decongestant and caffeine.  Don't try it, it doesn't work.  It just makes your insides all quivery and with no man around, it's a total waste, cuz there isn't anyone around to enjoy it.  Heheee!  Well, if I can still joke about sex, I guess I am not that sick.

      It was my birthday.  December 27th.  Thank you who remembered, and thank you for your generosity. I had a wonderful day and night, which started with Nancy and Stew and son, Friday night and led to a very, very memorable day and to now.  Mom, Sister and Sister-in-law took me to lunch at P. J. Chang's.   We gorged ourselves on Chinese and pretended we knew how to use chopsticks.  I was gifted with a beautiful purse, with a purse, with a purse(yes, three purses in one) that are all adorned with cute little kitties.  Enclosed was a fabulous color of nail polish, purple, to be applied at a future date.  Mom also included a digi-cam...spy-tech type key chain.  Yes, I now have a keychain digital camera.  As soon as I can figure out how to save the pic's I take, watch out when I bring my keys...heheheheheeeee! Sister-in-law gave me a beautiful necklace and earring set, I look like a princess. Sister, was overly observant about who I have chosen as my future "ex" husband and I am now the proud owner of the newest Toby Keith CD(Ohhh, he is so hot!!).  After gifts were opened and food eaten, Mom said we needed to go to the mall.  Ok, shopping, I am game.  We wandered around, not a store we went into and I ask, "Hey, what are we looking for?" and the next thing I know I was in the "Make a Bear Store".  Mom had planned for me to make a bear. Ohhh, and I did.  I picked out a bear, I held his heart, I rubbed it, I kissed it and I stuffed it.  I have a new bear, and he is beautiful.  He even has a birth certificate.  My baby bear.  And I named him. Welcome to my family, Shaggy Doo.  He is soooo cute...he is wearing gray boxers.  Heeehehheeeeee!  My evening/night plan was that I was to sing.  So after all was done with family I headed to the pub, I called appropriate people to watch and listen and did I sing. I did, and it was fabulous.  I got the heart filling ego boasting appreciation I needed and I loved it.  I know if I hit the key right, I can sing.  The microphone belongs in my hand. As the evening got late, like 2 in the morning.  My friends left and a dude I have sung with before requested we sing again.  Together.  "Picture".  Cheryl Crow and Kid Rock.  Ok, I did it, and they applauded.  And I smiled, and he smiled and then he kissed me.  And ya know what, it was nice.  Happy Birthday to me.

      I felt his fingers on my lips as I started to come awake.  I parted them and he dipped a finger in.  It tasted salty and manly, it was rough at the tip and I could tell his nails were clipped short.  I could feel his warm breath feather over my shoulder as I started to become more aware of him.   The feel of his hip against mine, the rough fur on his arm as it draped across my breast. I could hear his breathing, and the sensation of the beating of his heart. He turned toward me and his desire for me slid into my hand. He replaced his fingers with his lips, cupping the side of my face with his hand. His tongue probed my mouth and explored me. I heard a soft moan, as if from a distance and realized it was me, then a gentle smile formed on my face as I heard his baritone rumble in response.  He pulled away and as I opened my eyes to see him.  I weaved my fingers in his wavy locks and gazed into those perfect crystal eyes and with a whimper, I watched them fade to the dream.

Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to meeeeee,  Happy Birthday to me.  Today is my Birthday!  I was born at 3:17pm.....in 1964...Yey!!!

      And so the day is over......  I woke this morning before my alarm went off.  Excited as a kid, not for gifts, but to spend time with my family.  This was the first year in too many to count that almost all of us were together(My daughter still lives up north). My brother and his family are here for the holidays, so an extra 4 people are at my folks house.  It's loud, it's crazy and I remember now why nieces and nephews are so much fun.....when I have had enough, I can go home.  My son and I arrived at the folks house around 9am, happily unloaded our contributions to the overflowing pile under the tree.  A tree that was only visible from three feet up.  The little ones were very patient as we finished with the starting of dinner and after everyone had a generous glass of Mimosa's, we tore into the presents.  My son was surprised by the 5 foot air hockey table, which will be assembled in my livingroom this weekend after I take down our tree.  I, on the other hand, was gifted with several pedicure kits(are they saying my feet are offensive?), a perpetual calendar adorned with Teddy Bears, a huge stuffed bear from son, a really pretty sweater and a floating candle set from daughter, a bear nativity, a lighted mirror with a magnifying reflection, a picture of a fairy sitting on the moon, a  urlLink 2003 Jazz Festival Poster , and the best of all a Margarita set, which also came from son.  The Margarita set includes 4 glasses, a pitcher and a nacho tray.  Totally awesome, and I promise the next Margarita party is at my house.  As for the rest of the day. It was filled with stuffing face with too much food and cleaning up as the men slept in the livingroom.  Typical holiday.  Hope ya'lls was a fun filled as mine.  Merry Christmas all.

      Yesterday morning at work we had our Tacky gift exchange.   urlLink Carlene  was crafty and made me a "Leroy" shirt.  This is a "wife beater" (A-style T-shirt) with a patch on the front proudly displaying "my name is Leroy".   urlLink Jenn  on the same theme as Carlene, presented me with a Burgundy colored, leathery feely, coin purse which has in pink a letter L on the front.  Jenn altered it to read "Leroy" in rhinestones.  I swear it's a beautiful thing and since the coin section of my wallet has a broken zipper, I will proudly use it.   urlLink W  bestowed upon me gifts that represent a weakness of mine.  He gave me a Fireman's Hat, two little Firetrucks and a pack of batteries.  He is a man after my heart, he spoils me so.  And last but not least  urlLink K , (who feels he doesn't have an exciting enough life to share with us....Boy we want your drama!)brought in the most delicious cake to celebrate my birthday(the 27th) and delivered us our caffeine fixes for the next week or two with gift cards from Starbucks.  All was fabulous.   I, in exchange, delivered upon them gifts that took lots of thought and craftiness.  I slaved over a hot stove making my batch of Amaretto, pouring each into a beautiful colored bottle.  I also painstakingly sewed and glued fabulously tacky Christmas stockings for each.   urlLink Carlene's  had flowers and a garter,  urlLink Jenn's  was adorned with pearls and pink ballerina fairies,  urlLink W's  had Christmas packages and candy canes and  urlLink K's  was adorable with the multicolored festive bows on it. Also, they were each presented with a store bought gift.   urlLink Carlene  is now the owner of a pair of bedroom stilettos, properly topped with feathers.   urlLink Jenn  was gifted with her very own vibrating-all-over-body-massaging stuffed pink pig,  urlLink W  was graced with a black and white striped tie, to which he said was cool at  urlLink Hot Topic  while on a shopping expedition with me, and  urlLink K  received a Christmas theme throw, with a weaved picture of a church and snow. After being caked out and properly gifted we headed to  urlLink Zea's  for luncheon and dined on fabulous food.  Nothing like a Panini to make the tummy better.   All in all, I had a great time.  Laughed alot, laughed till tears stung my eyes.  It's good to have friends.  And ya know what, I am proud to say they are my friends.  Merry Christmas everybody!!! And may yours be as tacky as ours!

      I have decided that sipping on a bud-Light helps cool my sore throat.  I woke up this morning not feeling all that fabulous.  Actually sick, like I have a cold.  My pillow was soaked this morning, so I broke the fever and I was coughing and my throat hurt.  This did not deter me from my goals today.  I have been to Wally-World and deposited 78 bucks in their cash register.  I am far from being finished, but I did finish 4 off with that one trip.  Then I was in line for 20 minutes at the Post office and spent a whopping 25 bucks to get my daughters package to her in time(this was my own fault, I should have mailed it a week ago). Then I came home and was crafty all day.  I sewed, I cooked and I bottled.  I can not say exactly, cuz the receivers read this site...so You Better Appreciate My Efforts!!  Ohhh, my aching back!  I also wrapped until I ran out of paper....Crap, now I have to add paper to the list!    At least I accomplished something to day, more tonight and tomorrow.  I am feeling a little better, not so yuck anymore, cuz now I sit with Bud-Light in hand, cuz it's good for the throat.

      I can't believe the men in this area that I live.  Have you been taught the meaning of, "I don't want to see you anymore" or "Don't call me"?  Not only did Mr. Fix-it call me last week and ask if we could "get together", but last night as I was weaving through traffic, and finishing up a call to the local radio station because I won tickets to the "3 Doors Down" concert in February, I had a call beep in.  I finished my call to the station and checked my missed calls.  The number there looked familiar, but I couldn't place it, so I called it back.  A man answered and I asked if he had tried to call me.  He said, "Ohhh yes, I did, this is Mike", ohhh no the Mortician.  I haven't spoke to him in 6 months, why was he calling me now? After a couple minutes of pregnant pauses and uncomfortable silences, I came out and said, "We just didn't work out". I heard him sniffle on the other end and he started to bawl like a baby.  He then started to yell at me and tell me how we were so perfect together and he loved me and we had something special.  After a minute of this I realize he is drunk. And then, (I am serious here, this is true) my phone started to break up, so I could only hear every other word or so.  So I finally said, "Hello, Hey I can't hear you...Hello....Hey, Have a nice holiday, my phone is acting up and I can't hear....hello?  Ok, good bye"  Another classic case of don't drink and dial.

      On my way home today....wait....as J was taking me home today, we chatted about men, dating and the mishaps of our lives.  I thanked her for the ride(at least I think I did) and as I walked into my house I remembered something that had happened to me a few years ago.  It was Christmas of 1999, my first holiday alone, ever.  My soon to be ex-husband had already moved out, my children were at their dad's and I was in front of the computer goofing off. This person said hello in an IM and being the gullible, lonely heart that I was at the time, we started to chat. He described himself as 6' tall, 200 pounds, dark hair and eyes.  He said he was Italian and he considered himself handsome.  He didn't have a picture on the computer to send me, which was ok, we were just talking.  We talked for a few hours and more the next day and the next.  On the 3rd day I gave him my phone number and we talked on the phone.  He called me every day for several days.  Then he asked if we could meet and have a drink. *Remember, lonely heart here. I said yes and chose a place I knew and where there were people I knew. I told him to meet me there at 7pm on the next day. I got there early and ordered a Tonic with lime and sat at a table.  I waited and waited and finally this man walk in.  He was dark and handsome and he walked up to the bar.  I had hopes that that would be him, but he walked to another woman at the bar and sat down.  As disappointment washed over me another man walked in. When I saw him, I prayed like I never had that it wasn't him.  Bummer it was. Now I am not the perfect form of a woman, but when I describe myself I am very honest.  This man was too, but he forgot to tell me a few things.   First, that the bulk of his 200 pounds was in his ass. Second, that he was, ummmm, rough.  As in several facial scars.  He had what looked like a knife scar from his ear to his chin.(sorry, it's not that I can't look past it, it's just not for me) and third, he had the shakes.(like withdrawal's) Now, I smiled, I said hello, I was polite.  I even gave him the benefit of my doubt and told myself to sit and talk to him. As we sat, every other sentence he would ask me if I wanted a drink, to which I declined.  Then he grabbed my hand and started to pet it.  He very slowly started to trace the fine bones on the back of my hand and it was starting to freak me out.  I pulled back and he put his hand in his pocket as he leaned back.  I heard a crinkling sound and looked down. Believe it...I saw the outline of condoms, yes, more than one. I put my hand over my mouth and coughed, because I almost laughed and then I very calmly said, "ya know, I really don't think this was a good idea, I don't find you attractive and I most definitely am not going to sleep with you." He looked shocked and then he started to cry. Yes, he cried, real tears. He told me that we were perfect for each other and that I was his soulmate, he then practically climbed into my lap. I got him calmed down and then explained to him I had told my children I wouldn't be late and I had to go.  He asked to walk me to my car and I probably should have been rude but I said ok and told him I would be back after I went to the ladies room. In the ladies room I paced back and forth, I knew I had to get out.  I peeked out the door but he was sitting there and could see if I tried to sneak out, so I ran over to the window.  It was one of those crank out windows, very tall and narrow.  I knew if I tried to climb out, I would get stuck and wouldn't that be a mess. So, I had no real choice.  I left the bathroom and he got up and walked me to the door.  To my luck there were a couple people leaving too so they were in the lot as well, so I felt a little safer. We got to my car and he asked me for a hug, but before I could say anything I found myself in a bear hug.  He was smelling my hair and moaning in my ear as I peeled him off me.  Once free I jumped in my car and sped away as fast as I could. By the time I got back into my hometown I was laughing to myself at how crazy this man was.  I ended up back at work(I was the office manager for a liquor store) and I filled in my crew the details of my wonderful date. Thank goodness for Ali, she was my best friend there, she took me out and we toasted for several hours to how stupid blind dates are.

      I know....I have not posted in a few days.  Been very busy. Drinking. Frolicking. Being merry.  No, not really.  Had the work holiday party on Friday.  Food, wine, making merry...yey, I won 50 bucks!  Personally I would have chosen a different restaurant, and if there is a party next year I really do hope they choose a new place to eat. We ended up at Razoo's after, a few beers, a few shots and it appeared that all had left for other festivities by 7.  My son picked me up and we went to Crazy Johnnies for dinner and after filling my tummy with steak and mashed potatoes I was in dreamland by 10pm.  I am such a party animal!  I can honestly say, I behaved...yeah, it surprised me too.  I didn't pick anyone up, I didn't give out or get a phone number and my shirt stayed on.  Saturday, I played domestic and crafty.  I stayed home and made Christmas presents for friends, which they better appreciate.   Later, Son and I went to the Pub and played some pool.  Son was getting upset because these two guys kept eyeing my butt.  Turned out their wives were sitting at the bar.  Very typical! Losers!  Not that I was interested, because I wasn't.  Yes, they were attractive, I just wasn't in the mood to play the game.  Bleh!  That has been my mood lately, not interested.  The game is tiring.  I have decided to take a break, purge my system of the men that have been in my path these past couple months.  Regroup and start over.  I will try to stay away from little Greek boys, Firemen, Policemen and even him's...though I can't promise anything.  I will try.

      I ended up getting home late from work, I was tired but still needed to go to the store and do more Christmas shopping.  I asked Son if he wanted to go and he got this look on his face that resembled rejection.  He said, "Mom, I was just starting dinner for us".  Well, this was a surprise, I didn't even know he could cook anything besides heating up Ramen soup. So, I sat down, and told him I would go shopping after dinner.  He smiled and went back in the kitchen.  A few minutes later, he handed me a plate of Ziti smothered in Spagetti Sauce heavily sprinkled in Parmesan Cheese.  Not realizing I was starved because I forgot to eat lunch, I woofed it down.  To be honest, it was the best pasta I had eaten in a long time. Hmmmm, nice to have a man cook for ya once in awhile.

      My son asked to use my phone last night, so I tossed it to him and went back to chatting on the internet.  A few minutes later he comes back and hands me the phone.  I asked him if he was finished already and he said No, that I had a call and I might want to call him back.  I looked at him and asked who called.   The following is a somewhat accurate recant of what followed:   Son : Ummmmm, Mr. Fix-it called.  Me : What?!  What did he call for, did you answer it?  Son : Yes.  Me : Well? What did he want?  Son : I don't know.  When I said hello, I heard this deep growly voice kind of stammer and then he said, "Yo, is Leroy there? I'm looking for Leroy"  I said, This is Vixie's phone, you looking for Vixie?  And then he said, "No, don't know no Vixie, I am looking for Leroy."  Then I said, ok Mr. Fix it what ever you say and then he hung up on me.  Me : Leroy?!  What the fuck is his problem?  Ohhh my god, do I have to break up with him again?    And then I broke into hysterical laughter, tears were streaming down my face.  Son is looking at me like I lost it, but I didn't care.  The entire situation was just beyond belief.  Leroy....I don't look like no Leroy!

       urlLink Carlene  posted today about getting away Thelma and Louise style.  She fantasies about getting in her car and heading West, but she has responsibilities and she thinks she should "let go of her fantasy".  Let go, Hell no.  I have this fantasy as well, I have had the bright side and the dark side of it.  The bright side: Feeling light as air.  Laughing.  Speeding down the road with a map on the passenger seat and the radio blasting your favorite CD.  Stopping when you want, going when you want.  Taking loads of pictures as you go.  Tasting, smelling, seeing as much as you can until exhaustion takes over. I do this sometimes, yes it is on a timetable, I too have responsibilities.  I take a day and head where ever my car leads me.  I have a full tank of gas, a couple bottles of water and all my CD's.  The windows are down, the music is blasting and when I think I am lost, I pull over and look at the map.  I have driven to Biloxi, Kiln, La Rose and Baton Rouge so far....why? Because I can, that's why!  I can't have my full fantasy, yet....but I can have tastes of it.   If I don't let myself have it, then I could go back to having the dark fantasies.  What's a dark fantasy?  A dark fantasy is when you say yes to moving to Iowa.  You are promised there are jobs out there.  You are promised that a beautiful home will be found and you will be happy. Instead, you get what happened to me. I went and I searched for work.  I couldn't get a job because we didn't have a home to live in(we lived in a hotel) and we couldn't get a home to live in because we didn't have a job.  It didn't matter that we could pay a years rent up front, so we stayed in the hotel. We ate at restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I ate alot.  I put on 40 pounds.  I didn't want to get out of bed.  It had been 4 months and I was miserable.   One day we were on the highway and I was gazing out the window.  The leaves were gone from the trees, the grass was brown, it was cold out.  I started to fantasize about running.  I saw myself scream at him and jump out of the car.  I ran and ran, into the woods.  I saw myself cold and lost in the woods, but I felt warm and I felt free.  Free, really free and I liked it.  After visualizing this for awhile I turned to him and looked at his hand holding mine, I released his hand and in a quiet voice I said, "I have to leave", he asked if I would come back and when I said no, he nodded his head.    I don't have the dark fantasies anymore.  Just the ones that make me feel giddy, and they aren't always about driving a car either. I figure the more fantasies you have the happier you can be, just don't forget to pay the electric bill.

      This next week better be more enjoyable than last.  I didn't get any make-up sex...I didn't get any sex at all, no cuddling, no snuggles, no whispers of sweet nothings in the ear.  I slept alone(except for two cats hogging the bed), cold, and restless.  Saturday I went to see R at his detail, we walked around, drank coffee and talked.  He was very considerate and he seemed happy to see me and anxious about getting together later.  He walked me to my car, gave me a little sugar and told me he would call me when he was done.  I headed to Rainbows to see some friends and called J to see where she was.  She didn't answer and when I got to Rainbows I was met with a surprise.  Apparently Sabrina and Cass broke up.  Cass now has a boyfriend and Sabrina has a new Lady.  The new lady made me uncomfortable, she kept staring like I was a threat to her.  I thought to myself, "Lady, it isn't Sabrina that I am attracted to, it is Cass".  I left after a few minutes and headed to the Pub. I watched the rest of the LSU game and then Karaoke started up.  I called R and told him where I was and he told me to have fun and would call me when he was heading my way. Well, at about 1/4 after 1 I was heading home and I hadn't gotten a call, so I called him.  His phone went immediately to voice mail.  I was so mad, I tossed my phone to the passenger seat and sped home.   No missed call, no message, he did it again!  I went to bed angry and was even more so when I woke up.  I turned on the computer and it was like R was waiting for me.  I had an IM before I finished loading up.  He claimed he tried to call, but I must have been on stage cuz no one answered.  I asked him if he left a message and he said that the voice mail never picked up.  I told him he must have called someone else, cuz he didn't call me. 1st: after I called him and told him where I was, I never went back on stage, I sat at the table the rest of the time there and my phone was right in front of me. 2nd: My phone has never messed up so that I missed a call, never!  He told me that I had to "Trust" him.  I didn't respond to the trust plea, but told him that he better show Sunday night or there would be hell to pay.  Guess what.......I slept alone last night too.  No call, no show, no email, no nothing!  Ya know what the kicker is....he lives 5 blocks from me, I thought of him this morning and had to restrain myself from calling him.  As I was driving up my street, I saw him back out of his driveway and head the opposite way.  If he had thought of me, he would have called.  He didn't. He didn't!  I should have analyzed my iggy feeling last week, I believe another just bit the dust!

      I met up with W today to do a little shopping. I wanted to go yard saling, but it was almost 11 and I wasn't prepared.  I hadn't even looked at the paper. So, we hit the mall, checked out clothes, shoes and other stuff. I found a little something for J....heheheeee, she is gonna love it! And then I spied something for W, and I made a mental note to go back later, which I did.  I went back and bought the item....W is gonna laugh his ass off, or at least I hope. Yey!  I have one done, one person crossed off my list.  I am so screwed!  PS:  Do Not Eat At Applebee's.  The food is crap and it made me ill!

      I spoke to R today. Actually, had a little fight too.  And to be honest, I feel much better.  It seems that the secret assignment he was on last weekend was a few days away to unwind and shake off the every day hell he works in.  This did not sit well with me and I told him so.  I told him that going off and disappearing for days was fine, but a call to say, "Hey babe, I just need a few days, I will call ya when I get back" would have been freakin nice.  Instead my wild imagination was running amuck and sending me into a tizzy. I also told him that I am not trying to be a bitch, all I want is for him to tell me the truth.  I don't care what it is, just be honest. I also warned him that leaving me with 10 days of no sex was very bad, very, very bad and he shall be punished. To which he liked, and we both laughed and all is happy in my little world right now.  R is on detail tonight, so I will stop by and get a little sugar and leave turned on from checking out his nice little ass in those sexy uniform pants. (Nothing like a tight pair of riding pants to get a girl going!!) Then I am off to meet a couple friends to work up a sweat shaking my bootie on the dance floor.   And if I am lucky, I will be working it up for a good cause....R better take a blue pill, cuz the girl is hungry!  Whats better than a little make-up sex, huh?

      I am not really a pursuer.  If you call, great. If you don't, well sweetie, there are other's out there that would like some of my time.  I wasn't always like this, there was a time in my life that I needed constant reassurance that a relationship was still good and strong.  That time seems so long ago, a lifetime ago, another person actually.  Since the break up of my second marriage in 99, I really have been a lost soul.  Experimenting in alternative lifestyles, enjoying it to the point of addiction and feeling more lost when I left it.  There were relationships along the way, some good, some not so good.  But they always ended one way or the other. I usually reference them at the stalkers and the scaredy-cats.  The stalker way would be, I would settle for the guy(meaning: if I was a little skinnier, a little prettier he wouldn't have a snowballs chance in hell).  I would hit a dry spell so to speak and be in need of a little tender care.  The man would be willing, but most times be really bad in the sack.  I would either end up the chick he called at 10 o'clock for a quickie or he would be inviting me over to meet the family, so they could meet the future wife(happened more than once and within 3 weeks of first date).  The ending result would be that I would walk(RUN!) away, realize I had settled, and move on.  He, on the other hand, would either take the hint and leave me alone or become the next stalker on my list.  The scaredy-cat way would be that we would go out once and I would never hear from him again.  This would be confusing because we would have had a great time together, we would even set up a next date.  Then no call, no show.  Me, never having had a chance to find out if I was settling, my feelings hurt for a few days and then life goes on.  I never call them, I never initiate contact, I don't walk up to some strange man and introduce myself, they always find me.  Until I met "The Daiquiri Dude".   The first time I saw him was at the Irish/Italian parade.  He was working the shop and I ordered a Daiquiri.  I took one look at him and my heart slammed in my chest.  I couldn't talk.  I know I acted like a total idiot.  Later that day, my friend Nancy talked me into going back over and talking to him.  Eventually I did and we sat there for 4 hours and chatted.  It was refreshing to find a man that just talked to me. We exchanged numbers and a couple days later he called me.  We talked on the phone for hours and hours.  The next week he invited me over his house and we watched a movie, I don't remember the title, but I do remember it was a movie about salsa dancing. The next 3 months were amazing, he taught me things about myself, he made me feel beautiful, he healed my heart.  That last night we were together, I knew it was the last.  He was gentle and loving and he held me all night.  In the morning, I hugged him and told him when he figured out what he wanted to give me a call.....that was 6 months ago.  He never called.  And though I had fallen for him, I never called him either.  Instead I walked away and I gave away a wonderful man.  Where did all this come from....these thoughts...I haven't heard from R in 2 days via IM, 6 days via phone, and 8 days in person and I am too stubborn to call him.

      Had a fabulous dinner over at  urlLink Car's .   urlLink W  cooked most of the yummy food and Car,  urlLink J , Car's man K and I munched on Tostitos and salsa as well as sampling to our hearts content. Met some friends of Car's and K's, Jenn and ummm her husband, yeah whats his name, sorry.  They were nice people, very friendly. Anyway we had a great time, filling our faces and yaking. We left with plans in our heads for future Tuesday night dinners....someone said Theme night...ok, I am game.  All this, and I had a feeling all night.(ok, honestly, I have had this feeling a couple days now)  One of those iggy feelings that ya can't put your finger on.  I feel it coming from the direction of R and I don't know why. It's probably nothing, could be just that he has been so busy with work that I have not seen him in too many days to count, and the calls have gone to few and far between.  I just can't shake this feeling.   I really hope it's just heartburn...but I swear I smell somethin sour in the fridge.  I will let ya know if it's real or imaginary.

      I spent today in a meeting.  I was what we call the page turner. I stood in front of a computer and clicked the pages for briefs, while speakers spoke their speeches through the microphone I clipped on their shirts, ties or jackets. The first few went well, even though on occasion the mic would screech when they handed it back to me. My embarrassment occurred when a kindly speaker came up to me and informed me that every click on the keyboard, every cough I spewed was annunciated thru a mic on the platform.  All went better after I found the hidden mic and unplugged it. It was finally over after almost 9 hours of torture.    By the time I left work, the cold I have had off and on for over a month hit my voice and took it away.  I was still determined to go meet someone for a cruise on his new bike.   Yes, I had a date. At about 8pm I went outside and noticed the temperature had dropped and my voice was completely gone.  With a shrug I knew it would be best to cancel.  So, I called the place we were to meet and asked if he was there.  He got on the phone and through my strain of trying to talk he was thankful I called.  The goober laughed at me, playfully.  And to my delight we made another date. He is taking me for a ride on his new bike on Saturday and he gave me his number incase I am still not feeling well.  What a thoughtful guy.  And now that the Nyquil has started to kick in, I must go to sleep or pass out on the keyboard.  But with a smile on my face! I have a date on Saturday...heheheheee, now if I could remember his name.

      It's noon on Sunday and I sit on my bed in my jammies and ponder the weekend as it was so far.  Friday I ended up at the Den, Cel was there as well at Carm and her beau and a few new people and then of course JB eventually showed up.  I was sitting between JB and Cel, it is so nice to have the attention of two men, as cocky as they try to be.   At 9 the replacement bartender showed up.  She was cute, with her blonde hair, red lips and J-Lo butt.  I soon turned into chopped liver, as the guys turned their attention on to her.   Fine no big deal, I knew they weren't going to get anywhere with her.  But they tried and it was funny to watch. Then, I almost pissed my pants when around 2 in the morning she turned her attention on to me.  I guess you had to be there, anyway Cel left and gave me a peck good-bye and soon after JB walked me to my car and was rewarded with a hug and a peck good-bye too. I will see them all again in a few weeks, but for her...I do have her number {wicked evil grin}.  Saturday arrived with a splitting hangover but I did hook up with Nancy and her Boy Jason and a friend of theirs Steve.  When I first walked in, I thought for sure it was a hook-up.  I let Nancy know I was not interested, which made her laugh.   Oops, my bad, not a hook-up. So we started to play and while we were playing I kept having this weird feeling that someone was watching me, so I looked around and this man...yes man, old man, like in his 60's and wrinkly old....was staring at me.  Well Nancy noticed too and she pulled me aside and said, "Hey that dude keeps checking you out."  I told her I noticed and it was creeping me out. Well a few minutes later Nancy went up to get us some cokes and he walked over to her.  I heard her say, "What, No...but she is engaged"  I saw his shoulders slump, but he still kept on staring.  Nancy later told me he asked if I was married. The only thing I could do was roll my eyes, Lordy why do they find me? The man left and as he was walking out the door, which was near us, he was still staring at me and not watching were he was going and the poor guy tripped.  Now I can add that to my resume, I made an old man trip.  Great!  Saturday night ended with me hitting the Pub to sing a few songs, Miss J met me there and soon the place was packed with the wedding party from down the street. Some could sing, some we wished they hadn't. Around midnight, J noticed a cop outside behind my car.  I walked over to the door and watched him touch the trunk of my car and he wrote down something while he stood there.  He then got back in his car and started talking on his phone. I paid my tab and we decided to leave.  When the cop saw I was getting in the car he was blocking he drove forward and let me out.   He did not approach me, he did not follow me, nothing.  Very strange and I still have no idea why he was touching my car.  Though I did get a little tingly about the thought of handcuffs. Hey ya got to think positive right!

      I laid back on the bed and closed my eyes.  She wove her fingers in my hair and started to rub my scalp, from the top to the sides.  Her fingers splayed around my ears and she rubbed my lobes.  And soon I felt her fingers run across my face and down my nose.  My heartbeat was quickening and I had to be conscious to keep my hands at my sides, as she touched my face and massaged my cheeks. I felt her pull my bra-straps down my shoulders and I heard the squirt of lotion and soon I felt the coolness on my shoulders as she kneaded my neck and arms. My thoughts were not totally innocent, but I kept to myself with my eyes closed and laying as still as possible. She rubbed each arm, from my shoulders down to the fingertips.  Pulling each finger and rubbing my palms, holding my hand as she took care to touch every spot. She then pulled the sheet back and worked my legs, traveling down to my toes.  She paid an agonizing amount of time to my feet.  Rubbing the bottoms and sides till they felt like butter. When she thought she was done with the front, she asked me to turn over.   She then worked her way from my feet up.  Stopping for a moment at my butt, poking and massaging till it too was relaxed and pliable. Ohhh my god! She then took this massager and rolled it all over my back, I could feel it all the way to the front of me and it made me all tingley inside.  I heard myself start to scream in my brain and just then she covered me with the sheet and after a minute of beating on my sore muscles, she bent over and whispered in my ear.......  "You can rest here for a few and get dressed.  Meet me out front when you are ready."  Hmmmm, I think I will be needing another massage very soon, I believe I have found myself a LMT.  Ohhh, she was good, very good, almost as good as...........

      I know I said I would leave them alone, but the Fireman said hello to me today.  We talked for a few minutes, him telling me he was in town until tomorrow, me getting all warm and giddy.  He asked if he could have me for lunch and I could not refuse.  The prospect of being with someone was just too much to ignore.  I told him I had some work to do and for him to call me when he was on his way.  As 11 am came closer, I started to feel dread.  I had a feeling he would not call. At 2 pm, I gave up.    I should have known, but what the hell....disappointment is part of life.  Plus it was probably a good thing I didn't see him, he is just too cute and I would have drooled on him.  Miss J was a little more angry about me being stood up than I was.  But she was also right about something she said to me. That someone is out there looking for me.  As well as for her.  We both just got to find them.  Until he or she is found....man, the Fireman would have been a great distraction...dang it!

      For all those that had kind words and said little kitty prayers....  Shadow is doing well, or better.  Though, He seems to have lost his Alpha dominance and his sister seems to have found it, so I have to kick her out of the room for him to eat.  But I am glad to say he is eating on his own and he has been sleeping with me every night the past 5 nights.  Again, thanks for your thoughts...ya'll are great.

      Went over to my momma's last night.   I know, it sounds exciting, but funds are a little tapped, I had Vet bills, and she had beer in the fridge.  Anyway, I get over to Momma's and she has gifts for me.  She went shopping in the Quarter and found a purse I had been looking for.  It's adorable.  I just love it.   There is a story behind this too.  The little boy in the picture, his name is Ferman aka "Flip".  Flip's mother took this picture in 1947 and it eventually won a Kodac contest.  Flip also went to the Coast Guard academy with my dad.   Pretty cool huh?  Mom also gifted me with a misplaced Christmas gift and told me another one is coming as soon as it is found.  I collect Teddy Bears, so she added to my collection more with a "911" policebear and firebear.  The firebear is still missing.  Later in the evening a friend of my mom's came over and we headed to the casino.  Mom spotted me some money and I sat at a slot machine.  I put in $10.00 and played it for over 2 hours, then as I was about to cash in my coins, I hit for a hundred.  Whoo hoo me! It was much needed....now I can buy some food for the fridge.  Now back to my exciting life...later.

      I am a lucky girl.  My Momma is taking me to a concert tomorrow in Biloxi.  I will be seeing my future husband  , Toby Keith, Ohhh he is so hot.  Whewwww! And I am a lucky girl.  I would also like to fill you in on another concert.  I won tickets to  urlLink 3 Doors Down  for the February 4th show at the Kiefer UNO Lakefront Arena.  It's going to be an exciting triple bill with  urlLink Tantric  and  urlLink Shinedown  also playing.   Now, here where it gets good.  I have two tickets.   I don't have a date.  If you would like to go with me, to see the show, you have to tell me why I should pick you.   Remember it's just a concert, not asking you to put out, cuz I am not putting out to you. Not asking you to pay for anything either. It is simply going to a concert with a friend and if you want something else you will be on your own. If you have no interest in seeing the show, don't waste my time.    Let the ass kissing begin!

      Today, at the office, the subject of that woman that ran over her husband, "several times", came up. I had said that she had cause.  That she should not have had the sentence that she received.  I don't condone her action, I just understand the passion she had at the time. She was a woman scorned.  Her husband flaunted his affair in her face, he took his mistress around town and basically shoved it down her throat that he was being unfaithful to her.   Bottom line....she snapped. Was what she did right...of course not.   Would I do that...No, I am not that way. But have I felt the passion (the passion I think she felt), she displayed.   I believe I have.  My second marriage was a very passionate marriage.  John was my dream man.  He was romantic, considerate and he opened up my inner most secrets and allowed me to explore my intimate desires.   We played the swinging couple and had many adventures.  Some were good, some not so.  He left me several times for the other woman, but he always came back, and the fool I was, I took him back. He was always sorry. Well, the last time he left me, it was different.  He told me he loved me, but he was in love with her.  He didn't want a divorce, but he wanted to marry her.   This left me very confused. I started drinking very heavily.  I was drinking at least a bottle or more of wine a day, sneaking a quick pick-me-up during lunch and when that wasn't enough I would switch to Rum and finish a fifth in a day and a half. One night it was really bad.  I hadn't seen John in over a month and I missed him terribly and it hurt.  I needed to dull the pain.  So I started taking pills with booze.  I had been in a car accident a few months before and I had left over muscle relaxers and I took them.  One at a time, swigging what ever alcohol I had as a chaser.  I don't know how many pills I took, or how much I had to drink, but I eventually called John.  I cried and begged, and then I told him he would hear my last breath on the phone because I was gonna die. I wanted to die.  That's how passionately I loved him.  I was nothing without him. unbeknownst to me he had his girlfriend call the police while we were on the phone. Fortunately I became sick and barfed up the pills. As the police forced themselves into my home, I was being sick in the bathroom. A kind policeman sat with me for a couple hours to make sure I was ok, petting my hand and telling me I was worth something. It was dawn when he left and he turned to me and told me something, he told me I was a beautiful person and John was the loser in the end.  And with a nod I knew he was right. Was I like that woman, yes in a way....Fortunately someone helped me.

      I had to take Shadow in to the Vet today.  He has developed the sniffles and he hasn't eaten in several days. Dr. Siggy checked out his mass and his test results and concluded that he does not have cancer.  He believes he has a severe infection somewhere and this is why he has not been eating and been sickly.  Shadow has lost another 1/4 pound since Thursday and his temperature is up a degree and a half.  The Doc also agreed with the other vet that there is a mass in his intestine.  The cat needs to go poo.  But since he has not eaten and he has been so sick, he has not been able to go. So, Dr. Siggy gave Shadow an Antibiotic shot and some stronger meds for me to give him.  He also recommended that if I was unable to get him to eat in the next day, that the only option was to admit Shadow. The Doc prescribed some canned cat food, that has a consistency of pudding and I was able to syringe it into Shadows mouth.  After the first shot, he licked his lips and he was more accepting of the second dose. Hopefully I will be able to get the entire can(6 ounces) into him by tomorrow morning, if not, he is off to the vet again.

      Studies are showing that arousal and an active  urlLink sex life  may lead to a longer life, better heart health, an improved ability to ward off pain, a more robust immune system and even protection against certain cancers, not to mention lower rates of depression.   Great, no wonder I was sick for almost a month.  Now I am gonna die young, have a low tolerance for pain, have heart problems, develop certain cancers and be depressed about it all.    All because I ain't getting none!

      My computer is on a lot.  At work, of course because that is what I work thru and at home, well because I like it.  So this is the reason I am online all the time.  When the computer is on, so is Yahoo, MSN and AOL.  Not that I am chatting all the time, they automatically log-on when I turn on my computer and I like it that way.    Now because of this, I have to say, I get alot of unsolicited hellos from many different people.  Some are people I know and have given my screen name to and some are searchers.   Searchers are people that go into the profile directory and check out who is online.  I do believe they come across people that are online and they think that because you are online you are as bored or lonely as they are.  Guess what dudes, not always so.  I may be bored and lonely at times, but I don't do searches and act pathetic and beg for attention. The following are a few examples of things said to me while I have been online and most times I am at work and working.  I will also share my first thought(tho not what I responded with) after reading the offensive pop-up instant message.  Most times these are how they thought to start the conversation....what were they thinking?   He said:  I am a LICKER.  Does that turn you on?  First thought:  As I read it, my eyes bulged and I had a flash of a dog licking my face.  Then I tried to imagine the lapping sound and if it was a turn on.  Then I saw the dog in my head again.  I thought I was gonna hurl.  Not into beastiality, have no idea why I thought of a dog, but I did and I was grossed out.   I responded with a "NO!" and blocked him from IMing me again.  Gawd, what a freak.   He said:  I am 6' and 120.  First thought:  I envisioned a sapling being whipped around by the wind and then I tried to see us standing next to each other.  If he stood behind me, he could hide.  Two of him could fit in my jeans.  I could wrestle him in bed and sever his spinal column by trying to roll over during sex.  I responded with, Dude I am 5'9" and 210, I would break you.  He said he liked BBW's, I then told him to Fuck off.   He said:  23yo, 8inches and ready.  First thought:  I saw the age, I saw the "size"...then I kind of tingled...then I snapped out of it, for cripes sake, my kids are almost his age.  If my son was soliciting older women online I would box his ears.  Sleazy.  I told him I was too old for him.  He was persistent, gave me the I love older women line, blah, blah, blah.  So finally I told him to strip naked and I would be there in 10 minutes.  I haven't heard from him since, I wonder if he is still waiting.   He said:  I am Married and bored.  First thought:  Ohhh geez.  Then I actually said, "well, guess what sweetheart, so is your wife."  Ohhh, and there are more.  Lots of crude and disgusting remarks.  Ones you would never say face to face because you would get your face slapped.  But ya know what?  Keep trying boys, cuz one day you will get what you asked for, yes you will. And again...what were you thinking?  I am a LICKER, yuck...ewwww!

      I have decided that I don't care how much it costs, Shadow will have every available treatment to help him get better. If it turns out to be the worst case scenario, then while he is not in pain, he will be treated like the King that he is.  I am going to Petco today to get him a new bed.

      The Vet called with Shadows test results.  She said the Thyroid, Liver, and Kidney tested out fine.  But his serum was yellow and his cell count is elevated.   There are two scenerio's.  Both of which mean Shadow has Cancer.  The first is Lymphoma, treatable, with a high success rate of being cured with chemotherapy and the second and worst case is another kind of cancer, I can't remember what she said other than it was not good.  She is hoping he has Lymphoma and we will find out on Monday after he has a biopsy of that mass she found on his intestines.  Sorry I can't think right now, I am going home right now.

        This is my man.  Shadow Man.  He isn't doing to well and I had to take him to the vet today.  He has lost a lot of weight and he has been stumbling around.  The stumbling part I attributed to age, since he is 15, but last night he tried to jump on my bed and he missed. He has never missed before. So I called the vet office this morning and they told me to bring him right in.  The doctor examined him, poked and prodded him.  He mewed and growled.  The doc noted that his back teeth were in pretty bad shape, and he had a small mass in his colon, but neither would really attribute to his dramatic weight loss.(2 pounds in the last 6 months). The doc took blood, which turned into a cluster-fuck and two collapsed veins, they finally drew out enough for testing.   The doctor thinks it may be Renal failure, but is more inclined to diagnose a Thyroid problem because of the stumbling and there was no sign of blockage in his colon. Shadow became more active after the blood draw and obviously was ready to go home.  The doctor told me to take him back home while they ran the tests, if the tests come back that there is a serious problem, I will have to bring him back to the hospital.  Shadow was not pleased with this news and to prove his displeasure he urinated in the waiting room.  He is such a good boy.  Anyway...now we wait.  You would think after handing over 200 bucks there would be some more definite answers.  The things you go though for the males in your life.

      It's Monday and a New Year.  Fabulous!  I had a great time on my trip this past weekend.   Uncle Randy married Sue, finally!   I met a cousin young enough to be my child(Eric, he is 17). Visited with a cousin that I had not seen in 27 years and was introduced to her loser boyfriend and their two children. Drove by the old house that my grandparents once lived in, in Yukon........Reminisced about the times we spent there...the squirrel, and rabbit pies, the rabbit furs on the clothes-line, when Uncle Mike taught me how to play chess, goin catfishin, and the trouble that Garth and Mike got into. Spent Saturday at the Oklahoma Memorial....pictures to be posted as soon as I get them developed.  Just good family getting reacquainted and promises for more frequent visits.

      Happy New Year!!!!!!  2003 was an adventure and I look forward to new adventures in this coming year.  Last year at this time, I was tenatively still engaged to be married.    Good thing that didn't happen!  I'd have a slob living off my paycheck and I would have to be dealing with him poking me in the back with his woody at 3 in the morning.  Every night!  Yuck!  I am grateful to him though, he taught me that I wasn't in love with him.    Can I love?  Yes I can.  I encountered this past year the "Daiquiri Dude", he taught me that I could love again.   And because of him I know there is hope for me.    Yes, I have had my up's and down's over the year.   The Stalker Mortician, and the "you can break up with me", "Yo, is Leroy there?" Mr. Fix-it, and the married(no I am not) cop, and the "he had to be gay" Lawyer, and the "I need 80 buck's to pay my pool bet and tab" Greek boy.   But I have had good ones too.  Mr. Atlanta, his kind heart, I will be his friend forever, then there was the Fireman...hmmmm, ohhh who could forget him, Yummmm.  And ....well, maybe when he says it's ok to post him.  Those good ones have taught me and helped me.  I can love and I am lovable.  This New Year...I will not have a resolution...I am just gonna love.    My toast--Thank you for loving me, I love you bunches!    To 2004!  Hooray!!

      Well.....  I did something I probably shouldn't have, but...Dang it, I was in need!!! 4 months of torture, ok, 3 and 1/2 for those that are counting, is way too much for me to handle.  Last night, I went singing and drinking, and Joey showed up and after awhile I walked up to him and asked him what he was doing later.  He said, he wasn't doing anything and was probably heading home.  I cocked my head to the side and said, "No you're not, you are coming to my place!"  He was a little dumbstruck by my boldness, but a smile spread over his face and he said, "I guess I am".  We got in my house and shoes were tossed in the livingroom and we barely made it to my room.  And I got to tell ya, it was the best two hours of rolling around I had in a long time.   Hot and sweaty.   As for the details, all I will say is, Miss J is right about slim men and I have teeth marks on my boob.   Fabulous!  And Worth it!

      The weekend flew by.  The parades and working at the VFW helped pass the time I guess.  Friday the Kin from Kiln arrived and the party started.  We ended up keeping the bar open till after 3am. We caught up on news and took lots of pictures(which will be posted on Vixie's Photo Page in the next day or two).  We decided that we wanted to adopt each other, so I drew up an Adoption Certificate and Mom had them(copies for all of us) signed by a Clerk and Judge(also from the Kil'), so now it is official that the crew from the Kil' are our Kin. Saturday Mom and I decided we would stay local instead of watching the Downtown parades.  It was an early night at the VFW(closing at 1am).  We were all wore out from the night before. (Heheheee) Sunday, Mom and I met Son on Julia Street, for dinner at Mulate's and to watch Bacchus.  As usual, dinner was great.  I saw "Bartender", one of the SSDC people, but  he didn't recognize me.  No biggie, I didn't go up to him either.  After dinner Mom and I scoped out our spot in front of the barricade.  Waiting for 3 hours we were finally rewarded with seeing "Frodo", the Bacchus.  He is cute, I will admit.   I ended up getting bumped out of my spot, by a large, handicapped, colored boy, that I believe crapped his diaper.  I was pissed and tired of being stepped on.  So I reached in front of him and said, "Excuse me while I grab my chair you are standing in front of, 5 cent trinkets aren't worth smelling your ass!" So I went into the bar, ordered a drink after flinging my chair and growling out my frustration.  I felt much better after a couple Captain and Ginger's. I went back out, to find the boy gone and my Mom had spread out to save me a spot, so the rest of the parade was uneventful, other than getting pegged by beads, cups and stuffed animals.  We made it home by 12:30, tired and content. Monday I ran into the office real quick and then had to book it back home to make 110 Jell-O shots for the VFW and get ready for the ball. The Ball:  It was wonderful!  Ball Gowns, Tux's, Men in uniforms....Floats, food, Beer, Wine, Dancing, Lights, Confetti, Laughter............... Harry Conick Jr. is a cutie, Brad Paisley, well, Hubba-Hubba...both performed.  It was awesome.  I highly recommend attending one.  Fat Tuesday....I overslept, but made it to the VFW by 10:30am.  I didn't get to see any of the parades, The bar was just so busy. I even had time to be a bad girlie....Over the past week, I have been flirting with this very handsome, rugged man.  The first night he came in he was looking at the selection and I asked him what he would like.  He said he was checking to see what we had and I responded with, "We ain't got any milk".  He cracked up laughing and asked if he looked 12.  I didn't mean it the way it came out, I just didn't want him to order a Sombraro or something, so I laughed and said, "Actually 11".  Ever since then when I saw him come in, I would holler, "Hey, Milk-Boy! Wanta Tall one?"  Anyway, he was there Tuesday, sat in the bar almost all day, talking to me, looking at me with those big brown eyes.  I found out what I needed, he lives in my town, he owns his own company, he has his own car, he lives alone, he isn't married, but he has a girlfriend.  But, he is miserable.  Before he left I told him I would be at the pub on Saturday at 10pm, singing...he said he would see me then.  Hmmmmm....  I ended up leaving around 5 with Janet and we headed down to the 9th.  Gilbert met us and he surprised me with having his ex with him.  I was not pleased, but hey, we aren't BF/GF, so he can do what he wants.  He did get his payback....I had this little Mediterranean boy hitting on me.  Telling me that he loved older woman, how he wanted me to teach him.  It was cool for awhile until he started trying to stick his tongue in my mouth.   Gil didn't like that too much. After I fended off the little boy, another boy stepped in and tried his darnedest.  He had more of a shot, very cute, 30, worked when he wanted(to pay the rent, buy booze or smoke), shoulder length dreads(my mother would have loved that), he smelled good, real good.  But I resisted, I kept reminding myself I hadn't shaved my legs. Later Gil, Janet, Annie(ex) and I went to breakfast.  Gil played footsie with me under the table and after awhile he leaned over and said, "I made a big mistake didn't I?" I said, "Ohhh yeah, Big, Huge!" "HUGE!" He left shaking his head and Janet and I drove home.  I got in at 3am, but to my credit, I got up this morning and made it to work AND worked a full day....   I had to go to work, AGEE's dropped Shadow off at work, I feel much better that he is home.  I miss him, so do the girl's and though he will deny it so does my brother...he told his daughter(Caroline) that Shadow was gone.  She drew me a picture of kitties running, surrounded by heart stickers...she is such a sweet kid.  Fabulous...now that was a great brain dump.  I will try not to go so long with unloading next time.  Happy Hump Day!

      I am doing really good today. Friend's and family are being very supportive and it's nice to know you all really care. I even was surprised by a few. Gilbert called me last night to give me his condolences and how he wished he could come over and cuddle me up.  I thought that was so sweet and he put a smile on my face.  We talked for awhile and before he said sweet dreams, he begged me to call him anytime I wanted.  And he stressed "anytime".  Man, what a sweetie. Today I went to lunch with Jenn and Warren.  We dined on sushi and it was Yummy!  The talk was good, I always like to spend time with them....they sometimes make my heart happy.  As for the weekend....well it is Mardi Gras weekend.  The people from Kiln will be here any minute, to which I am anticipating.   I love them! It will end up being a total drinking, eating frenzy for the next 5 days.   As well as getting hit on by my boys, M and S, though I don't mind, they know what buttons to push, BUT.....I must still refuse, I like their wives too much. {Sigh}  So, if I don't post too much or if I post something I will sober up and be embarrassed about, forgive me....It's been a crappy week!

      I am tired! I am emotionally drained!  My son called me as my mom and I were leaving the VFW tonight with devastating news. Shadow was not well.  He told me that he was unresponsive and drooling and had defecated on himself.  Mom and I rushed to my house to find just that. Shadow was in a seizure as I arrived. In a panic, I called my sister, who was a Vet assistant in another life and she called the hospital as mom started the car as I rushed out with Shadow. He siezured all the way to the hospital, which put me in a state of hysteria.  Mom sped through town and got us to the hospital in record time.  By then, I had said good-bye to Shadow and he laid content on my chest as we ran into the office. The Vet scooped him up and rushed him away from me. The minutes were agonizing, waiting seemed to take forever. She gave him a shot of Valium and put in an IV and he was sleeping when she brought him back to me.  We went over his history as we waited for his blood work to come back and she asked me what I wished to do. She told me he was in Guarded condition and I would eventually have to make a discussion.  Mom told her to do what it took.  And then the Vet asked about if it came down to resuscitating him.   I told her "No, let him go if he wanted to go". She wrote something down and then looked up and told me to say good-night to him.  She was going to put him in a warming bed since his temp was down to 96.6 degrees.  And she wanted to start some Antibiotics. Just as I was leaving, she came out with the test results and she raised his condition to Serious.  It appears his body is in shock.  He is hypoglycemic. Though she said for me to not get all my hopes up, she did say that so far, he can be helped. My hopes are up, but I know deep down he will go.   Just not tonight.

       Brown , my hair is Brown.  Ok...the color I picked up was a color I was using a year ago.   urlLink Garnier Nutrisse, Brown Sugar #63 .  Well, one time last year I went to the store and they didn't have any.  I went back several times and to several different stores, but was unable to find my color.  I asked the clerk and she told me they weren't going to get it anymore. I was shocked that they would pull Sarah Jessica Parker's color off the shelf. So I conceded and bought one shade lighter, with red highlights.  I liked it, so I kept using it. Well, last night, I was in the store and low-and-behold, they had #63.  So I grabbed two boxes and skipped home. As read in my previous post, I was dyeing my hair at midnight last night.  I rinsed and toweled dried, I looked in the mirror and to my horror....  ALL THE RED WAS GONE!  I told myself to relax and look again in the morning, so I went to bed.  I woke this morning and looked in the mirror again...and guess what?  Crap!   BROWN!   Now I have to wait a few days and go get the other color I liked better, the brown makes me feel flat. And I want pizzazz!!

      As I type this it is Wednesday.  That makes it 3 days of the new me coming out.  Monday, I went shopping with my mom. Nails done, and yes...they look fabulous! Dillard's was a stop so mom could pay her CC bill.  I hit the clearance rack, and 12+ outfits later and $257 spent, I was at the shoe section buying knee high leather boots spending even more(I must say they are sexy and worth it!).  Tuesday, I got my hair cut.  And cut it is!  Short, spikey, sassy!  I love it!  Now it is just 5 after midnight and I have dye in my hair....color?  Hmmm, we will see when it is rinsed... Ohhh, and I picked up some blue gel for next Monday's Ball...awesome!

      I met up with my friend Janet last night.  I haven't seen her since last July...I know, some friendship. Anyway, we caught up on all our adventures since then.  She isn't working as much, isn't going to school as much and lost her boyfriend to death last month.   She loved Chris very much and was planning a future with him and he was taken from her quickly, because of illness. Though she is doing better, she is now able to talk about it, but she is still very angry.  We eventually lost ourselves to the parade in Metairie and when that was over we cruised down to her haunts in Gentilly and found a bar to listen to some Jazz. Don't ask me where the bar was, I will never find it again.  Don't ask me the name either.  I just know that when we walked in, I was greeted by the most delicious piece of Manly-Eye-Candy I had seen in a long time. Tall. Dark. Broad shoulders. Long Raven Black hair. Long slender fingers. Perfect chin. Perfect nose. Yummmm. I asked Janet who it was and she looked over to see. She laughed and told me "NO!".  She then said to go ahead, just wrap him up real good.  But to be warned, he doesn't have a job, doesn't have a home of his own, doesn't have a car.  He is a bum.  Like that had stopped me before.   I didn't have any designs to pick him up, he was just cute and nice to look at.  Anyway, the night went on, the music was awesome and I met several of Janet's friends.  All nice, all sweet. One in particular to a shine to me and before I knew what was going on, I was in his lap and he was writing his phone number on my hand.   His name was Gil, not married(I even asked Janet), employed, has his own place in Gentilly.  He is warm and round.  Just a cuddly Mexican Teddy-Bear.  We talked, we laughed and at 3 am, we went to breakfast.  He held my hand, he pulled me into his embrace and snuggled with me on the ride home.   Outside his house, he asked me to stay, he said we would go shopping and buy the fixings for him to cook dinner for me.  He said I liked to eat and he liked that.  He said that a girl that isn't afraid to eat is a good girl.  I couldn't stay and I told him so.  He nodded his head and said we would another time. He kissed me and said good-night and he walked to his door.  He said I was a good girl and asked to see me again.  Of course I said yes.  I called him this morning, while I still lounged in bed, groggy from being out till 5:30 in the morning.  He was still in bed too.  He was pleasantly surprised to hear from me.  He actually thought because I didn't stay with him, that I was blowing him off.  He thought I wasn't interested.  I could hear the smile on his face as I reassured him that that was not the case. No that definitely was not the case.

      I got this from over at  urlLink Mad Poet's  place.  I really wanted to have Faery Wings, but "Noooo", I am always the strong one.   Really now?    You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I worked my ass off today and it was worth a reward,  I went over to the parents house and started my laundry.  I say started, because the dryer died and it took 5 hours to dry one load.  Momma is buying a new dryer tomorrow/today/Sunday, so I will finish the clothes eventually.   Anyway, as the clothes were washing and tumbling in a box with no heat, I worked on my Beetle. I bought a siphon kit, so I could drain the gas tank.  I was thinking the gas was old and maybe that was why it wouldn't accelerate.   Hey, no! No gas came out. I knocked on the tank and it was pretty much empty.  So I put some gas in, and fired her up.  She sputtered and coughed and then she was purring.  A slow rate, but  a purr.  After a few minutes I was smelling gas and she was back-firing really bad, so I opened her rear and "Crap!" I blew the fuel filter.  Gas was everywhere. I turned her off and locked her up and headed to Auto-Zone. Got a new filter and a couple car do-dad's...air freshener, window cleaner, glittery rear-view mirror decor(girlie stuff), then headed back to replace said filter.   I did it, all by my self.  Geez, not like it's a hard thing to do! So, I get it all attached, clamps in place, and I pushed the filter back and.... POW!!! Sparks!!!  I went flying across the driveway! Man, don't try that unless the battery is disconnected, how stupid was I?   Whewww! Ok, got over trying to fry myself and started her up.  She worked, YEY!  But Crap again, she still won't accelerate.   I give up, I don't know what the hell I am doing.  I am just a girl that has a book and a box of tools...Damn!  Mom came out to see what I was doing and coaxed me away to set up the VFW for Mardi Gras.  Sure, I needed the distraction. I ran home and grabbed son and we headed to the VFW. Son got to work putting up the mirrors behind the bar and Mom and I started decorating.  4 hours later the place was beautiful.  I swear, I have never seen it look so good. Mom and I were standing there and at the same time we said, "It looks so good I don't want to go!" You got to come by and see, I am so proud of our handy work.  So then here comes my reward.  I went singing tonight, after all that I had already done today.  I sang well.  I Wowed them. Joey was there too.  He asked how my week was, I said I was busy.  He was cool with that, no asking for explanations as to why I haven't called him.  We sat together, we sang together and we got hit on by a couple together...ok, how cool is that?   We didn't respond to the flirting, Ok...I didn't respond to the flirting, and they soon left and went on their merry way.  They were too young for me and I won't go there with Joey, NO, never! Joey left early, which was fine with me.  I stayed and sang a few more songs.  When I was done, I cozied up to the bar to talk to Lisa and Kim (Bartenders) and this guy comes out of nowhere and starts talking to me. Telling me I have a beautiful voice. He comes to hear me sing. I am beautiful.  Now I am thinking....."Next date??"...Next Stalker?"  And that is my reward....Laugh will ya!

      I have had a fantastically fabulous week.  Get this I went on three dates.  Date one: Was the Super Bowl party with Joey.  Great time, nice guy. He asked me to call him on Monday and I did.  The call started out good and then he was talking weird.  Like relationship stuff.  What are we gonna do about us?  You make me feel good.  I need to see you again. and You are so beautiful.  This is what he is saying to me.  I am a little weirded out about it.  Yes, we had a good time, but he really isn't my type of guy. First, he has an alcohol problem.   Second, he has a drug problem.  I even caught him popping at the party, which pissed me off. and Third, I can't deal with screaming kids while I am talking on the phone.  And his grand-daughter was screaming while I was trying to listen to him.  Then I heard his daughter, the mother of the child, scream...."I don't know what she wants!!" I was bad....I told him I would call him back, and I haven't.  I know I will see him tomorrow at the Pub for singing night, I will think of something nice to say.  Date two: Ray called me on Tuesday.  All apologetic about not calling me back on Saturday.  Plain and simple, he said he forgot.  He asked me to meet him at the Patti that night.  I did and the stinker didn't tell me he was bringing his bike.  I wasn't dressed for a ride, so I sat on it after he asked me to plant my 129 pound rear on it. (Compliment, or he is blind?)   We had a good time, ate some food, talked and he asked to see me on Thursday.  I said that would be cool.  Date three: Met Ray at the Patti for dinner. (His favorite place and my girl, the Spanish Chica was there) We were having conversation and his phone rang.  He answered, mumbled in the phone and hung up.  He said it was his buddy Frank. Well, a few minutes later, Frank shows up as well as a student from his Karate class.   I am thinking, "Ok, this is strange...great block"   After a few minutes, I get up and say good-night.   They all look perplexed.  Yeah whatever! Ray says to me that he will call me on Saturday to go for a ride.  And as I am staring at him(not sure what kind of look he saw, but...) he hems and haws and says, "I will call you tomorrow". I patted him on the shoulder and said, "Well, I won't hold my breath" Frank laughed, Ray didn't.  But he proved me right...my phone didn't ring.  Ok, so the dates themselves weren't fantastically fabulous, but hey, I am back in the game.

      I have wanted to go to a ball since, I don't really know.  Let's just say, I have always dreamed of dressing up like a princess and seeing all the beautiful people, in their beautiful clothes, dancing the night away. Well, last Fall I bought a couple gowns, with a goal in mind, that I would be attending a ball, any ball, somewhere.  And today I handed over my payment for admission to  urlLink ORPHEUSCAPADE .  I will be dressed in a floor length, blue glittery, sequined gown.  I will also be in the company of a gazillion coworkers and intoxicating myself until the wee hours of the morning.  Yey!  I will be beautiful!  Wait!  I will be more beautiful than I am, if that is possible.   You will have to wait for pictures that will be posted at the end of the month.

      Son had a great time last night at the concert.  But there was almost a riot and he was a little freaked out about that.  He said  urlLink Shinedown  was awesome, but was a little disappointed in  urlLink Tantric , they didn't perform very well.   He said he enjoyed the show that  urlLink 3 Doors Down  put out, but they only played about 30 minutes and then the lead singer threw his mic into the audience after screaming, "Good Night New Orleans!"  He said lights came on and the clean-up crew came out on stage.  He wasn't sure what to do, so he stood there and watched as the crowd became loud and obnoxious.  Then, 3 Doors Down came back out, the drummer did a 10 minutes solo and they sang a couple more songs.  This made the crowd happy.  Concert over, Son walked to the car in a downpour soaking him to the skin.  (My car seat was still wet this morning.)   Other than getting scared by a potential riot, getting soaked and being stuck in traffic for two hours, he swears he had a good time.  Me, I got the T-Shirt!  Yey!!

      Just so you all know....  The tickets I won for tonight's concert, featuring  urlLink 3 Doors Down , I gave to my son.  He is there now, hopefully enjoying the show and not getting flooded in, as the rest of us suffer thru a torrential downpour and lightning storm.  I hope he brings me a t-shirt.

      A good friend of mine sent this chain e-mail to me.  I thought I would share....Happy Giggle!    I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.    I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.   I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big willy or huge boobs.   I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.   I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you're finished.   I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.    I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place.   I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it.    I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon, and all the less important ones just never go away.   I've learned to say "fuck 'em if they can't take a joke" in 6 languages. (Well, not really, but it sounds good)    Pass this along to 5 friends...trust me, they'll appreciate it.  Who knows, maybe something good will happen.  If not...tough shit.

      I had a date yesterday.  Yeah, me, a real date.  But I am getting ahead of myself, so I will start from the beginning.  Saturday started out as a nice day, the sun was out and it promised to be warm.  This was perfect, because I had a date to go for a motorcycle ride with Ray.  Well, when I finished with work and I walked outside, it had started to rain.   Bummer for me again. I called Ray, and joked that it wasn't meant to be.  We talked for awhile and I thought he was going to ask me to go out anyway, with out the bike ride. Then he asked if he could call me back because he had a customer come in.  I told him that was ok and I would talk to him later.  I went home and lazed around the house for a few hours and surprise, surprise, no call from Ray.   I was not upset about it, I really didn't care whether he called or not.    I took a shower and dressed to go out, it was Saturday night, Karaoke was a must anyway.  I ended up at the Pub around 9 and as I walked in I was spotted by Joey(My birthday kisser) who was sitting at the bar.  He nodded and I nodded back. We eventually moved to sit next to each other, to talk and to get a little closer to the DJ table.  He sang his songs, I sang mine.  I even sang a few that I had not had the nerve to try before, I surprised myself. A few of Joey's friends showed up, one of them an older woman and they moved in on our table.  I had gotten up to go to the ladies room and when I came back, the older woman was in Joey's lap.  I reached over to get my beer and she jumped up, all apologies that she was moving in on my man.  She kept insisting that we were together and a couple and if we weren't she would make sure we were. I thanked her for her offer, and told her that we were not a couple, or together and if I wanted that, I didn't need her help. They left and soon it was almost 3am and time to go home.  Joey walked me to my car(ummm, truck, cuz I be drivin my brothers big Man Truck).  We stood there for a few minutes and talked, him holding my hand caressing the palm with his thumb.  He pulled me into his arms and I heard him sigh and he whispered in my ear that I was beautiful and I felt his arms encircle me in a warm embrace and his lips capture mine.  I heard myself say that it was time to go, that he had to go and he whispered back that he knew he had to go.  He pulled away and I was chilled with out his warmth.  I felt odd and I turned and jumped in the truck to escape. I watched him walk away and then I pulled out and went home.  The next morning I woke, small head-ache and 30 bucks poorer, but a smile on my face.  And then I rolled over and remembered I had invited Joey to a Super Bowl party that friends from work were having.  I wasn't sure if that was what I wanted to do, I wasn't sure if I could actually go through with it.  It was a date for cripes sake.  So, I called Jenn and asked her her opinion, she told me it would be ok, so then I gathered the courage and I called Joey. He was ready and excited about spending time with me and meeting my friends. I picked him up and we got to the party, I really hate being the first one there, but it seems I always am or at least close too it.  Anyway, we got there and Joey seemed to be comfortable around all these new/strange people.  Though he had a bit of a hangover and his tongue was killing him (that's what he gets for getting it pierced). We both had a really good time, there wasn't any affection, or any private time, but I was comfortable with it.  He was sweet and nice to me, which is the most important thing. He surprised me right about the start of the 4th quarter, he pulled me aside and asked if we could go.  He asked if he could have a little private time, time to talk and just be alone.  So, I said my good-byes and we left. We talked during the drive and he asked me why I was so stand-offish.  I explained I wasn't very good at dating, that it had been a really long time.  That 9 times out of 10 after the first date, the guy usually moves in, or I find out he is married, or that he is a loser, or some kind of freak.  He laughed and told me he was none of those. I even told him that I really wasn't that way, I would never climb all over him, slobber on him like some pathetic girl, no matter how starved for affection I am.  He turned to me and in a surprised voice said, "Really?"  I also told him, if that was what he wanted, he should look elsewhere. He paused for a moment as we pulled in his driveway. He then asked if it was ok to kiss me goodnight.  I said yes and as my eyes were closed I could see flashes of light.  I am thinking, "Wow, fireworks" and I open my eyes to 4 pairs of eyes staring from the carport.  His children were watching, how embarrassing is that? He said goodnight with a groan and climbed out of the truck.  I watched him walk up to the kids, all clamoring for attention.  I could see the words mouthed from the oldest boy, "Who is she?", with that Joey turned back toward me and I saw him smile and he blew me a kiss.

      Over the weekend I had two dreams that were similar.  Friday night I dreamed I had dyed my hair blonde.  What was weird was, in the dream, my hair was really long and thick and wavy.  I haven't had that kind of hair in 5 years.   So what did I do on Saturday morning? I went to the store and bought some hair color....but a rich auburn color, not blonde. I really like it and to me it is a dramatic change, as in at least 5 shades darker with a cranberry tint to it. I went to the Crawfish boils, one on Saturday and one on Sunday and I had to hint or tell people I had changed my color.  Apparently it's not as noticeable as I thought.  Then, last night I dreamed I was a blonde, but with short hair.  I wonder if they would notice if I did go blonde....Nah, probably not.

      I have been debating all day whether or not to post this, but here I am.   Read it and weep. I did it again!  I had thought that Ray and I were going to dinner or something, but he called around 7:30 and told me it was nice enough for a bike ride.  I grabbed my leather jacket and we were on the road by 8.  It was nice.  The air wasn't too cold and the warmth of the man sitting in front of me was intoxicating. We cruised down River Road and over the Luling and as we were heading back on 90, he hollered over his shoulder that he had wanted to get a room.  I perked my eyebrow and he caught my look in his mirror, so he asked if I was up for that. Of course I was, I told him. Within minutes we were rolling around on a kingsized bed tearing each others clothes off.  It started rough and clumsily, but then we slowed down and it got a little better.  I found myself totally into it and the next thing I knew he was jumping off me and telling me he wanted to shower with me. Ok, but we hadn't really done anything, yet. I laid there for a few and heard him turn on the water.  I eventually made it to the bathroom and climbed in the tub with him. It was nice, I liked the shower scene and after we dried off was ok too. But when all was done, and we laid there and snuggled, I realized why he and his wife fought so much. He wasn't all that good.  I will probably be stupid enough to do it again.....just to make sure it wasn't just boring sex.  And if it turns out to be the ho-hum again, well, then I will be nice and slowly fade into an experience of his past.

      Since 1994 I have thought of myself as a Sports Bra Kind of woman.  Slip over the head and ready to go, ya know what I mean? Actually, I was in a car accident in August of 94 and I hurt my back and neck and I bruised my ribs, so it was painful to wear a bra.   I wore spandex tops that were a size too small to hold the girls together and then I graduated to Sports Bra's when my ribs were healed.   I had a few regular bras, cheapo kind, never wanting to pay more than 10 bucks for something that nobody is going to see for very long.  I figured no matter if you paid 10 dollars or 50, it would still end up either around your neck or on the floor.  Anyway, Sunday, Miss J brought me one of her old "push the girls up" bras.  Later that night I tried it on and I got to tell ya....I couldn't see my feet.  I took one look in the mirror and was struck silent.   Why?  Because the Bra was a "D".  And I filled it.  Full. Holy Crap! I never knew I was a D....I always thought I was a C.  I guess that's what you get when you buy your crap at Wally-World. Not anymore, last night I was at Lane Bryant shopping.  I got 2 more of those sassy, hug-me, thrill seekers and a couple shirts that are low enough for ya'll to get a peek.  And ya know, since there is a sale on them, I may go back and get a couple more colors.  Ohh, the "little" things that make me Happy!

      Ahhhh, what a weekend.  The Ladies Aux had their first annual craft fair on Saturday.  I was the raffle chairperson and bellowed over a microphone for 8 hours giving away fabulous prizes.  Though we made a few mistakes over the day, it was a great success and we all are looking forward to next years event.  After the craft fair, I went to sing.  My fan club was there and it seems I have acquired a new groupie.  My son's buddy, who calls himself Robo, and is the ripe young age of 23 and a Marine, decided it would be a hoot to flirt with me.     Hmmm, 23?   No, he violates my rule, plus his 5'3, 125 pound form couldn't handle me at 5'9" and a plump 200.   Ohhh and he included Jenn in the picture too.  She turned him down also, though he did promise an all night whirl.  The flirting went on for a couple hours and during that time, my son was freaking out.  At one point I thought his head was going to explode from rage.  It was actually pretty funny. At 2 it was time to go home, I still had to make Jell-O shots for the next day, so Son and Robo drove me home.  Robo was sitting in the back seat and got out of the car when we got to my place, he walked in front of me, wrapped his arms around me and gave me a big wet smooch on the cheek.  This made Son start screaming....I guess you had to be there...it was totally hilarious.  Sunday I was back at the VFW by 9:30 AM for the Irish/Italian Parade.  Me and my 90 Jell-O shots.  The bar was packed all day, so I stayed in and helped out my Mom for most of it.  I did get to see my Dad in the parade and spent , maybe 45 minutes outside.  It was beautiful, warm, slight breeze, sun shining.  Anyway, after a little while I felt hot and like I was burning.  I was burning, I baked myself.  I even have a sunburn line where my necklace was.  I am lobster red.  I am thankful that it doesn't hurt everywhere.  It only really hurts in my armpit, yes.....I burned my armpit, I guess when I had my arms up waving for beads.  You ever burn your pit before....you don't want to, stings like a bitch when you shave.

      I can't wait for the rest of this month to be over.  I am so busy the next two weeks, I am having trouble trying to think.  And I really need to think.  Everytime I believe I have figured out my problem and decide to remedy it, something else walks into it.    Ray came back in the picture.  We finally did go for a ride on his bike and I was right about how good it was going to feel.  I felt like I fit so nicely up against his back, it was warm and cozy and good.  After the ride, he followed me home and we sat in my car and talked for about an hour.   Of course with the occasional break to make-out like teenagers.   And then something clicked in my brain and I asked him how long he's been married.  He gave me that coy look, and then with a sigh of resignation he admitted he has a wife.   One of 22 years.  Fuckin great!  That definitely put a close to the evening.   I told him to call me, because I wanted to talk about it.  I need to talk about it.   I have known this man for a year and he has never, ever mentioned a wife.  He talked about his son, his father....but never his wife and I want to know why.  And I seriously doubt it was because he had designs on me, we have known each other a year.  And he knows how I feel about married men. So we will talk.  He called me and we are going to lunch on Monday, it would be sooner, but he has tournaments all weekend and he will be out of town.  He will explain and then I will tell him I can't. Gawd, I am so glad I didn't sleep with him.  SO this weekend will be busy for me and the time will pass too quick.  The VFW is having their Craft Fair tomorrow and then Sunday is the Irish/Italian Parade.  Lots to do and no time to complete it.  Hoping Monday comes quick so I can get some rest.

      Sometimes I really need to laugh.   I ran to the local grocery store to grab something for lunch today and as the check-out clerk was ringing up my veggie tray and fruit cup, she mumbled.... "Will there be anything else, Sir?"  I was struck silent.  I looked up at her, then looked down at my breasts and thought to myself how could I be mistaken for a Sir?  I paid for my food and in a haze, I sulked back to my car.  As I was adjusting my seatbelt I caught a glimpse of myself in the rearview mirror and it occurred to me I forgot to put on lipstick this morning.  Maybe that was why she thought I was a Sir?  Lastly, a  urlLink gadget  that every girl needs.  You will need two though, or you'll look lopsided.

      I went and visited with my lil' Spanish Chica, Nancy, last night. I hadn't planned on it, but I had heard on the radio that the Shania Twain concert had been rescheduled and I wanted to make sure she knew, cuz she has tickets. (She had no idea)  Anyway, I was sitting there and she comes up to me and asks why I looked so blue.  I didn't want to get into it, but she hounded me and I told her I was feeling a little lonely and down about it.  So we started talking about the last year and the ups and downs of my experiences. This Sunday will be one year ago that I met "The Daquiri Dude", the Italian Stallion of sex appeal, the one I let go after 4 months of total bliss. She thinks that I should dress all sexy and saunter over to the Daquiri shop during the parade this weekend and order my usual.  She thinks I should be all cool and aloof and drag along someone to make him jealous.   Don't worry, the Daquiri shop is the last place I will be.  He may have made an impression on my heart, I doubt I did on his.  If I had, he would have called me.  Sometimes I wonder why it is taking me so long to get over that one, it's not like we had a commitment or anything.    She then had me laughing over the Drug Addict, then Mr. Fix-it and the Mortician.  And then I got another I told you so about the cop....Blah! Then out of the blue she stops sweeping and asked me why I haven't let go of Billy or Irv.  I tried to explain to her that there was never that kind of relationship between us to let go.  Billy and Irv will always be my guys.  I love them both dearly.  She couldn't understand that.  I have an unusual relationship with them, one kind with Irv and another kind with Billy. Billy saved my life. Irv is my pervert. And I know that if I pursued anything different, I would lose what I have with them.  Period.  End of subject. She did change the subject and the evening ended soon after.    On my way home I had a revelation, sort of.  I think I still hold a lot of bitterness toward my Ex's.  I think that maybe one of the reasons I can't let myself get close to someone as of yet.  The reason I run at the prospect of a relationship with someone.  I know I don't have as much resentment toward John as I did a year ago, but Cathy-Lynn...her, I hate, with a passion that is rotting inside me.  I need to get over that.  I need to get over my fear of women. I have not written about her.  About how it felt to be with her.  About the joy and the pain of her.  About how much I loved her and her tearing my heart out. I think it's time to let it go......

      My sister has this cat.  She is spoiled beyond any child I have ever known.  Get this, the cat has her own pets, two parakeets and a fish.  Why?  Because the "Cat" likes to watch them. The other night, Manda was up feeding the baby and the cat, Bubbles is her name, was pawing at the baby's bottle, so Manda says to her husband that Bubbles wants some bottle.  So brother-in-law makes a bottle for the cat.   I kid you not. Now Bubbles get a bottle when the baby gets his.  See for yourself.

      The plan:  Leave office by 4:30 PM, swing by and pick up son.  Waste 30 minutes cuz the VFW doesn't open til 6.  Stop by VFW, cash check for 60 bucks, have cocktail and go home.  Shower, put on sexy knee-high boots, denim skirt and velvet blouse.  Go dancing.  Spend some of the 60 bucks.  Got a phone call and now.......  The actual: Leave office about 4:30 PM.  Swing by and pick up son.  Waste 30 minutes til VFW opens.  Stay at VFW and bartend for Cooties function.  Make 60 bucks, plus tips, and have cocktails for free.  Hmmmmmm, you tell me which is the better choice.

      Have ya ever been driving along and a good boogie-down song comes on the radio and you are over-come with the urge to pull over, jump out of your car and shake-it until the song is over?  But then you think about how stupid you would look, dancing in the breakdown lane of I-10, so you end up dancing in the drivers seat and wondering if you look like you are having an epileptic fit instead?  Nah, me neither.....

      It's another fine Wednesday in the life I lead.  Another day of me, myself and I.  Blah!  It is another day of why...that's all it is.  It's an aggravating, depressing, soul-searching time.  I really hate this time of the month.  I just want to curl up in my little double bed, with a heating pad, my cats, a case of Sauvignon Blanc and a pile of crappy chic flicks.  And most of all not think about how alone I am.  I constantly wonder if I have made the right choices.  I silently analyze my situations and compare them to other peoples lives.  Am I really stronger emotionally like they tell me?  How come I don't wrap myself up in the potential like they do?    There are several people I know, in real life and via the web, that  have to be  in a relationship.  They are not a person unless they are with someone.  Some of them are so desperate for companionship they will throw away their own desires and adopt their partners.  They will lose themselves in the union, become one with their partner, forget that they have their own choices and settle on being a shell of what they really are.  They will be so involved they will not even realize they are unhappy.  Painfully, when the relationship is over (because the partner is done using them) they don't know who they are.  They become lost and invert into a pile of blubbering nothing.  They will be desperate to get back what they had and will cling to any morsel that the EX-partner will throw them.  Hoping that they will come back.  But they don't and the ghost of my friend/associate/what-ever, will wander aimlessly until they are captured yet again by a new partner.  Only to have the same cycle happen again and again.  Personally, yup, I have done it.  And maybe that is why I am alone.  I fear doing it again.  I fear losing myself in that black-hole some call devotion.  Afraid of being so hopelessly devoted that you crumble at the slightest idea of being separated.  Of becoming so desperate for love I will take anything, from anyone.  The right choices...does anyone know what they are?

      This will be short and sweet, because all of a sudden I have a banger of a headache and it hurts so bad I have to keep my right eye partly closed. Honestly I must look hilarious, or deranged, because I keep winking at the computer.  I just wanted to say I had a fabulous day yesterday.  I spent it with my friend Janet in the Quarter and we just walked and window shopped.  We did go into a few shops and I made mental notes to go back and purchase some absolutely delightful toys from "Second Skin".  By the time we had spent 7 hours just wandering around, we were exhausted and ended up in the By-Water hanging with her friends.  I came home tired, but content as well. Thanks Janet, I had a great day.  Now I am going to the bathroom to yank out my eyeball and kick it across the room.  Gawd that hurts!

      I downloaded a few more pics from Mardi Gras.  You can see them  urlLink here .   I warn you in advance, if you can't view a man in thigh highs and flashing his panties it would be best if you didn't look.  Not gonna miss much, it's just his butt and not a very good looking one either.  I also put a Chatter Box at the bottom right, under the sidebar.  Not sure if I will keep it, we shall see.  I will write more later...have to spew about my adventurous weekend.

      As it is now known, my baby sister had her little boy yesterday.  All went pretty well, but I have one little complaint.  Her friend, Paula,  and "God-Mother" of my nephew was a waste of space during the entire birthing.  I have no clue why she was there, to give comfort I had thought, but you can't give comfort when you are cracking jokes with the dad-to-be, Ted, and taking pictures.  Mom and I got to the hospital around 9 AM.  Manda was in the recovery room, because at that time there weren't any birthing rooms available.  She was uncomfortable, having contractions about every 6 minutes or so.  Well, Ted and Paula went and got breakfast, so mom and I could stay for a few, which was fine and then we switched when they got back, mom and I had breakfast.  Manda finally got to her birthing suite about 11 AM.  Mom and I walked in there and Paula and Ted were looking out the windows, talking, joking and having a grand ole time.  I sat on the sofa across the room and was watching my sister. Everytime she would have a contraction she would scrunch up her face, hold her breath and tears would stream down her face.  The third time I saw her do this, I walked over to her and sat next to her.  I grabbed her hand and told her to find a focus.  And breath.  She needed to breath deep breaths. So as the next contraction started, I coaxed her into breathing.  I said what a good job she was doing and to breath in and out.  I held her hand and when it was over she looked over at me and smiled.  She still had some tears but she said it wasn't as bad.  I sat with her for the next three hours and coached her thru every contraction.     My complaint is here....why wasn't Paula doing this for her?  I was told, by my sister, that Paula was coming to stay with them, so she could help with the delivery and then help at home after.  I really hope she is more help at home, but to be honest, I am a little frightened that she will be more work for Amanda.  I also don't understand why Paula is going to be the "God-Mother".  But then that also is not my choice.   At 2:30 the doctor came in and Ted asked him to give her an epidural, which he did, as well as a "pit" drip.  Ted then took over as her support, which I reluctantly gave up.  The rest of the labor went uneventful until the end, when after two hours of pushing, Amanda was exhausted and couldn't find enough strength to finish.  The doctor used "Salad Tongs" and Thomas was born without further incident.  We were all allowed to go back in the suite to meet Thomas and congratulate the new mom and dad.  They were both glowing and the prized little one is adorable.  We didn't stay very long, maybe a half hour and as we said our goodnights, Ted approached me.  He gave me a big hug and said loudly, "Thanks for coaching Amanda.  She wouldn't have done so wonderfully if you hadn't been here."  I tell ya, That really felt good!

      It's almost time to call it a day.  I will be stopping by the VFW Lounge to see my Momma, since today is the first official day of it's  "GRAND REOPENING" .  Keith has been talking about "Apple-Tini's" all day and I have a craving to be fulfilled, bring 'em on Baby!  I just hope I don't get too poluted.  I have pictures to download and email to send out.  If I don't get the new pictures loaded on my Pic Page, or if I do and there are some that are upside down, then you know who to blame.  Those "Evil" Green Tini's, Evil I say!

      I know it's just after 10 PM and I want to write so much, but I am beat. I had a hard day today.... Making a new Database report (Thank you Jack!!! You are the most Awesomest Dude!!!)  and talking to my Customer  and reconfiguring my work load  and picking up my son from work  and making dinner for myself  and drinking a bottle of Wine while I watched "American Idol"... and Voting! Just exhausting!!  Plus...I was rudely awakened this morning at 4:16 AM!!!! My Text Message went off... It is loud! It is obnoxious!  I flew out of bed, because the first thing I thought was, "Son didn't come home and he was in jail" (Don't know why I thought that, maybe because he is like his Daddy, Anyway....), second thought, "Friend needed me, was sick or in hospital", and then the third thought, "Shit, Manda is in labor!!" (Manda, being sister that is ready to pop my new nephew out any minute).  These were the thoughts that went through my head in the two feet I had to reach over to get my phone. I fumble with it, I opened my eyes to read....and....  No, it was none of those thoughts...I had "SPAM"...What the Fuck!!!!  In the wee hours of 4:16 AM, I received a message from k8xvfv@netzero.net wanting to know if "I want a supermodel body?  I can TRIM 2 sizes in one month!  This new pill REALLY WORKS!  Just call (800)494-7185"  Well! You BITCH!!!  Ummm, NO! You woke me up!! Damn you SPAM!!!  And worst of it...I was in the middle of a really awesome sex dream!  Damn you SPAM!!  Now I am off to bed, I hope I can pick her up where I left her...

      Conan O'Brian is booming in the background as I stood on my balcony.  Standing there like a college girl, wearing a T-Shirt and panties.  The memory of earlier this eve flashing like a slide-show in my brain. I met D at the Sportswear store after work today.  We were standing next to my "rental" and we discussed the possibilities of seeing each other later.  I told him if he wasn't able to make it it was ok. I would see him tomorrow. And then I paused and then said, "allofyou". He backed away slowly, asking for me to repeat myself. I did.   I then sorted the words I said slowly in my head and I felt heat climb up over my face, embarrassed.  He thought I said The "L" word. Afterwards, it turned into a tease, of us both saying "allofyou" to each other. To be honest, it was kind of funny.  So, we did end up seeing each other later, we bantered back and forth with the "allofyou".  My chica met him and she gave a thumbs up and he left to do what ever he had to do.  Tomorrow I will see him again. After he plays golf, and I hope he thinks of "allofyou" while he is teeing off.  Again when he thinks he has a birdie.  Then again when he reads his score, no matter how awful it may be. When evening comes, he will be mine again.  All of mine.

      Today I spent most of my time doing "Car Accident Crap".  Call car insurance.  Call doctor.  Get call back from doctor.  Get call from car rental place.  Get accident claim cancelled.  Call back insurance company.  Get claim reinstated.  Call car repair place.  Have claim cancelled on me again.  Crap, call insurance company again.  Drama....Ohhh, the drama.  And all thru that, D sticks there with me.  He is my calm.  He makes me laugh thru it all.  He is a wonder.  He makes me wonder why.  He knows I am PMS'n(what a bonus, huh?), he knows my back is sore, he is supportive and accommodating to my needs.   He drove me to the doctor and went into the examining room with me.  He drove me back home and stayed with me the rest of the afternoon while I made phone call after phone call.  To do this he had taken the afternoon off of work. He is the man!  I finally got my rental.  The very nice German boy, Georg, saw my flusteredness and felt bad for me.  He ended up upgrading me to a Mercury Sable, 2004.  Ohhh, talk about luxury!  Except one thing....why do they put tape players in rentals?  All I have are CD's, my tapes are in the bottom of a box somewhere and so old(80"s Pop), Ugh!     PS: Since D will be reading this on Thursday the 29th....Happy 3 weeks Baby! (HeHee)  XXOO!  PPS:  Thanks Momma!! You made my evening with  urlLink this .  I so loved this show!!!  Listening to it as I post...Eeeeeee!

      I woke up this morning, no alarm, since I forgot to switch it over, at 6:30AM.  Why?  Because I was having such a Charlie-Horse Cramp in my leg.   And you thought it was naturally...HUH!  Anyway, I called in.  I am just waiting for the Doc's office to open up so I can go in.  In the meantime, I went outside and took a crap load of  urlLink pictures .  It doesn't look as bad as my memory told me it was, but it still sucks the big Donkey ____!

      I would like to apologize to my Peoples in advance.  More than likely I will not be bringing in the Krispie Kremie Goodness of donuts in the morning for all to enjoy.  I am very sad right now, as well as a bit sore.  You see, on my way home from work today, some stupid bitch rear-ended me.  She smooshed my bumper into my trunk and accordioned my trunk lid.  While she was at it she poked holes in my bumper with hooks that were on the front of her truck. After I was able to get my car off to the side of the road and I slowly emerged from my car, I started screaming at her for hitting me.  Several time I called her a "stupid f-ing Bitch".  Her calm response was, I hit your car, whats wrong with you.  This made me madder and of course I became hysterical. I calmed enough to call my dad, who came running to my aid and then I called the boyfriend, who also came running to my aid. She was overwhelmed by my posse'.   The police finally showed up and gave her a ticket, calmed me down and sent me on my way. Insurance company has been notified, but have to call them back in the morning to verify all that is covered.  I have medical if I need it, a rental car when my baby is in the shop, and whatever else I may need at my disposal.  Some may not like them, but I Love USAA. Now, as the Advil I took is starting to wear off, I feel very tight and sore in my lower back and my neck is throbbing so bad I feel a headache coming on.  I am still very angry and upset about the entire ordeal.  My car is my joy.  She is the first brand new car I have ever bought on my own.  She is only 10 months old.  And now she is a "Hooptie".

      I don't claim to have any special powers.  I am not telepathic.  I am not even religious. But I have seen dead people.  The first time I saw an entity, that I remember, I was maybe 17 years old.  I was climbing up the basement stairs in my home in Falmouth.  I thought I heard a noise and I turned.  As I turned I saw a little girl sitting on the floor.  She was wearing a pale blue and white dress and was sitting cross-legged.  Her hair was about shoulder length and I could see that she had very delicate features.  In her hand was a small ball and she was bouncing it.  My first thought was, "Oh, she is playing jacks" and when I started to focus on her, she disappeared. I ran up the rest of the stairs and slammed the door.  I never told anyone about it, because I thought they would think I was crazy. Then I thought about it some more and I thought I was crazy.  As years went by I didn't see anymore.  I would feel a cold sensation, a warm sensation, a calming.  But never a visual.  Until one night I was working at the liquor store I was a manager for.  It was about 10:30PM and I was about to go in the big walk-in cooler to stock beer.  As I came around the corner I saw a man that looked like my boss walk into the cooler.  I was a little befuddled.  Firstly, my boss doesn't were those kind of white shirts.  And second, I knew my boss was upstairs in the shower(don't ask, I just knew).  So I went barreling in the cooler ready to confront this dude for being in my cooler and there wasn't anyone in there.  I searched and searched, nothing. Later, I told my boss about it.  He asked questions.  What did he look like, what was he wearing, Blah, Blah, Blah. When I told him, he started to chuckle.  He said, 'no big deal.  That was my dad".   Apparently his dad had died in the building 20 years before and would appear on occasion.  I told him that it would have been nice if he told me beforehand, I almost clobbered the "ghost".  A few months later, I had moved to Iowa(Another story).  The man I was with and I decided we were going to buy a house.  We searched high and low for something we could afford and something that fit.  We ended up in this little town, I already forget the name, looking at this house the realtor was raving about. We pulled up in the drive and as I climbed out of the car I immediately felt nauseous.  I didn't want to go in the house.  He was persistent and practically dragged me into it.  We wandered thru the tiny kitchen, the downstairs bath with no tub and he then when upstairs.  I was standing in the livingroom and felt myself become very dizzy.  The room began to spin and an odor seemed to come out of the walls.  I ran for the door.  I felt a hand grab me as I reached the door and I let out a scream.  It turned out to be my boyfriend and he guided me out.  As we were standing outside I asked the realtor what happened in the house.  She was quiet for a moment, the replied that there was no way I could know.  Then she admitted that the man that had owned the house before had committed suicide in the livingroom.  His body laid there for a week before anyone noticed. Needless to say, we didn't buy the house and I soon came to New Orleans, alone, without the boyfriend.  Have I seen more dead people, yes I have.  I am just a freak that way.

      It's a Monday.  As usual it started out crap, with more dilemmas with Son. Son decided to stay out all night, with my car, which had me calling him and tracking him down so I could go to work. I grumpily left him standing in the livingroom, mouth hanging open, as I refused to let him drive me to work so he could then have my car all day as well. The Balls that boy has. I am actually considering, saying screw them all, and moving out on my own.  My own apartment, my own space, my own opportunities to just run around nekkid when I feel like it.  Then I think about it, and the sappy mom feelings come out.  I know I will not do it.  I will just suffer with the crap.  Be miserable in my own house.  Suffer the unavailability of the livingroom couch(because that is where he sleeps, cuz he is too lazy to go upstairs).  Suffer the nasty man smell in the fibers.  The odor of feet permeating the air.  For all this, what will be my reward?  I can tell ya none of the following:  No return of my own stereo. No unlimited use of my own car. No bubblebaths with the door open. No beer left in the fridge. No seat down when I go to use the terlit. No empty sinks. No, No, No!

      Went to Walmart, with the intentions of getting  urlLink hair color ,  urlLink wine  and cheese.  I did get those, since I am sitting here now, with wet goo in my hair, patiently waiting for my 25 minutes to be up.  I am not gonna look as pretty as the little Asian girl on the box, but my hair will be awesome.  I did have a dilemma in the store though.  I spent $80.02.  There were things just jumping in my carriage.  Food....ok, I can always use food.  But paint?  I bought paint.  I do need it to finish a project and it was on sale.  But why can I not just get what I need  NOW ?  Why am I such a weak person that I buy this crap. Ok, not so much crap, I got a new lipstick too.  Ohh, and these really cool sunglasses and this nice colored lipliner.  Argh!...I got to rinse!

      D met us all for lunch today.  Me,  urlLink J ,  urlLink K  and  urlLink W .  D sat and waited for us all, for an hour.  He is such a sweet man. I arrived first and at the table were 4 sets of flowers, one for each of us.  I glowed inside, wanting to just cuddle up this man and keep him all to myself. Hug him. Kiss him. And all that good stuff. Lunch was good and over.  They all left to go back to work and I had taken the rest of the day off. I have the time, I am taken advantage of it. So, D and I headed back to my place.  As we walked up the walkway, I said, "betcha son is still asleep on the couch".  Guess what.....I won.  The rest of the afternoon was spent enjoying each other...so much so that Son asked that next time to please tell him to leave the house.  Ohh, sorry dude!  Afterwards, D was sitting in front of my computer and I was laying on my bed and the conversation lead to us.  And feelings.  Mostly my feelings. I will admit, I do have feelings.  For him.  I am not sorry about it.  It happened.  And ya know what, I have not felt this good in a long time.  If that is wrong then too bad, cuz I don't care.  He left and I thought I wouldn't be seeing him again for a few days.  His work schedule is not compatible with mine, so thems the breaks. So a couple hours later, I pulled up to a bar where some friends of mine were playing pool tonight and surprise, surprise...he was standing at the door.  It was great...it just was.  Sleep now, with a smile.....Man, it's been a long time since I have had this.

      I met my D for lunch today.  With  urlLink MGJ  too. I got to the diner first and was greeted by my D with a smile, a smooches and flowers.  He got me flowers! He got some for J too. Mine all purples and pinks, J's all yellows and oranges, carnations and daisies and wild flowers.  I couldn't kiss him enough. I think he was a little taken aback by my reaction. I just couldn't help myself, he makes me so happy and bubbly.  He could just sit in front of me and do nothing and that would make me feel good. Hmmm, Yeah!

      I am addicted to  urlLink Altoids .  If I let myself, I will devour an entire can of them in a day.  I don't suck on them all the way, I always end up chewing them.  I know it is based on an oral fixation and sometimes this is a good thing.  The bad thing is, if I crave them and the store I am at is out of stock, I will go to another store to find a can of those delectable peppermint delights.  Tonight, D came by.  He suffered thru  urlLink "AI" , which he calls "Star Search", sitting next to me.  Afterwards, I brought him upstairs for his reward. He laid on my bed as I sat next to him and I popped two Altoids in my mouth and chewed.   With a slow wicked grin I asked him if he ever had one of these.   I undid his belt and popped two more little white mints.  Springing him free, I then began to give him a BJ with the mints still in my mouth.  Periodically inhaling through my mouth and even taking him out and blowing a slight exhale on him. He groaned, "Ohh, cold".   It really wasn't cold............  Ask him, I really think he will highly recommend it.  PS: It works for girls too.

      We are delving into the past on this "Monday Night Story Hour" and I will be kind and leave out all the explicit details.  It's St. Patty's day week back in 2000.  I was recently divorced and had a good tax refund.  I wanted to get away so, I surfed the net looking for a B&B someplace in New Hampshire.  A place I could drive to.  A place I had never been before. I picked a little pink house in the small town of Bethlehem, New Hampshire.  A beautiful place called  urlLink Angel of the Mountains . I called, made my reservations and arrived on a Tuesday.  My host was a sweet man, who welcomed me like I was family.  He showed me around, explained his wife was out of town and told me to make myself comfortable. I unpacked my things in my room.  It was a cute room on the third floor.  It had low windows that peaked out and was decorated with flowers and felt very homey.  I collapsed on the bed and let out a sigh.  It was definitely a little piece of heaven. About 4PM, I was served wine with a cheese and fruit plate while I warmed myself by the fireplace and watched some TV.  Afterwards I was informed that there was a nice restaurant about 4 blocks away if I cared to have dinner. Thinking it was just a short walk, I left my car in the driveway and trudged along.  It turned out to be more like a half a mile, but the meal was worth it. I had Salmon served with a wild rice and some vegetables and complimented it with a nice glass of wine.  For dessert I had Pecan Pie.  I wasn't ready to hike back to the B&B, so I sat at the bar and sipped a Cognac.  I chatted with the bartender and a couple of the locals and about 8PM I started back to the B&B.  About half way back I realized two things.  First, I was tired and second, the elevation, 2 glasses of wine and a Cognac made me tipsy.  I barely made it back, climbed up the stairs and passed out with my clothes still on. I woke the next morning feeling a little hung-over but refreshed.  My host had breakfast waiting for me.  Omelet, fruit, juice, coffee....all fabulous.  He asked if I had an agenda and I told him I thought I would try skiing. But as I climbed in my car, I decided to drive.  The next thing I knew, I was in Canada.  The man at the check point asked my intentions as I stopped at the border.  I guess my dumbfounded look kind of threw him.  I replied with, "I thought I would say I did."  He realized I had never driven to Canada before and the next thing I knew, he was pinning me with his flag pin and welcoming me. With a wave, I was on my way.  Then it occurred to me, I have no Canadian money, I have no Canadian map, I don't speak French...Crap!  So, at the next turn around(which was 28km up the highway), I u-turned it and headed back.  I ended up stopping at the tourist place on the border, got myself a shot-glass and a scarf and when the lady asked me if I had anything to claim, I was proud to tell her of my finds. I ended up back at the B&B early, my host disappointed that I didn't end up going skiing, but I told him of my adventure which made him chuckle. I went to the same place for dinner as the night before, but drove this time.  It was much quieter and I didn't stay long.  I had an early night.  The next morning, I was determined to try skiing.  I arrived at  urlLink Loon Mountain  about 10AM.  I rented skis, boots, poles and paid for a lesson.  The guy at the desk told me to put the gear on and go out and practice for awhile, since the next lesson started at 11AM.  So I did.  And I fell.  And I fell again.  And I fell on my face.  On my butt.  On my side.  I ended up soaked to the skin, bruised, sore and in tears.  I was in the middle of the bunny slope and I took those damn boots off and walked back to the lodge. I discovered I hate skiing! I was so thankful to get out of there....Never again!  The people at the lodge are probably still laughing about me. Anyway, it turned out good...as I was on my way back to the B&B, I spotted a sign that said Beer tasting.  I ended up at a pub, having a delish lunch, sampling beer.  I won a pilsner glass, a t-shirt and a bumper sticker.  It was so much fun, I forgot my butt hurt. I went to a different restaurant for dinner that night and then on the way back to the B&B, I saw a light on at a little hole in the wall next to where I was staying.  I hadn't seen it on the other nights, so I stopped. There was a man behind this old bar, a woman sitting at the bar and another man over to the side.  I spotted a nice Port and asked for a glass. The next thing I knew, I was on my third glass of port and it was just me and the bartender in the place.  He asked where I was staying.  I told him and he said he was closing.  He asked if I wanted to go for a swim and I said yes.  He smiled and told me he would be by to pick me up in 10 minutes.  We ended up at another hotel.  The pool.  The Sauna.  The Hot-Tub.    As he drove me back to where I was staying it started to snow.  I gazed out into the night and concluded that it was an incredible vacation.

      A few years ago, when I lived on the Cape,  urlLink Falmouth  to be exact, I tended bar at the  urlLink Nimrod .   Monday night was my shift.   I loved it. Eventually, we, me and my patrons, turned it into Monday night story hour.  At midnight, they would gather around the bar, glasses filled, eyes upon me, music low and I would tell a story.  All were true, all were about my mishaps and adventures.  Some are still being told to this day.  Anyway, I don't tend bar anymore, except for an occasional fill-in at the VFW, but I would like to start up "Monday Night Story Hour" again.  So, I have decided to post it.    Yey, the revival! TTFN...it's not night yet.

      I ended up at the  urlLink Chateau Pub  last night.  Had me some dinner, yummm sampler plate.   J came by, another friend and son showed up too.  I was hoping D would come by, but he didn't and I am fine with that.  Anyway, I sang my usual.  Voice sounding good, not too many flat notes or mess ups, so I was feeling confident. I shakingly put up another song.  One I had not sung, with a microphone in over twenty years.  My name got called, I knew it was that song and I quietly asked the peoples to be nice, I hadn't sung it in awhile. I surprised myself, I didn't get stuck in the high note, I made my own.  And with just one stumble, I finished "Open Arms" by  urlLink Journey  to a very loud roar of clapping. Man, that felt good. It's another song to add to my list.  Now, all I need is a man to do "Stop Dragging my Heart Around" by  urlLink Tom Petty  and  urlLink Stevie Nicks  and I'd be golden.

      I got this in an Email today....thought it was cute and sometimes very true.  Why we put up with some of them, I have no clue.   Thirty Reasons Why Men Have Two Dogs and Not Two Wives:    1. The later you are, the more excited they are to see you.  2. Dogs will forgive you for playing with other dogs.  3. If a dog is gorgeous, other dogs don't hate it.  4. Dogs don't notice if you call them by another dog's name.  5. A dog's disposition stays the same all month long.  6. Dogs like it if you leave a lot of things on the floor.  7. A dog's parents never visit.  8. Dogs do not hate their bodies.  9. Dogs agree that you have to raise your voice to get your point across.  10.

Another man will seldom steal your dog (except in KY or TN).  18. If you bring another dog home, your dog will happily play with both of you.  19. A dog will not wake you up at night to ask, "If I died would you get another dog?"  20. If you pretend to be blind, your dog can stay in your hotel room for free.  21. If a dog has babies, you can put an ad in the paper and give them away.  22. A dog will let you put a studded collar on it without calling you a pervert.  23. A dog won't hold out on you to get a new car.  24. If a dog smells another dog on you, they don't get mad, they just think it's interesting.  25. On a car trip, your dog never insists on running the heater.  26. Dogs don't let magazine articles guide their lives.  27. When your dog gets old, you can have it put to sleep.  28. Dogs like to ride in the back of a pickup truck.  29. Dogs are not allowed in Bloomingdale's or Neiman-Marcus.   And, last but not least:  30.

      Ahhh, Saturdays.   Lazy in the bed after being out last night for a birthday party.  Yeah right!  My Mr. D was there(at the party) with me.  I know he was bored, since these were my peoples and he was the new guy.  But he stayed, he endured, he is awesome.  And after the party, ok, maybe 10 peoples(so it wasn't a big party) were there, there was another event that kept the jollies down, but anyway.  Me and D ended back at my place for a little frolic and as usual, he took care of this girl.  Hmmmm, I am way to used to this.  This morning I woke up slow, flicked on the computer to see what was up and wanted to order tickets for my daughter.  She will be here on the 21st to celebrate her 21st birthday on the 22nd.  You read that right, My baby girl is going to be 21.  I was 10 when I had her.....bwahahahaa!  Well, I was trying to get into  urlLink Yahoo Travel  and every time I clicked the select button, I was getting booted out of the site.  I was starting to get really pissed, then my mom called.  She and Dad are in Baton Rouge for a VFW thingy and she forgot some pictures.   Yup, I got dressed and ended up meeting my dad about half way.  I am such a good daughter. As I was pulling into the meeting spot, D called and was wanting to know what I was doing....I explained the Blah, Blah, Blah and he told me to call him when I was back.     In a nutshell, I called him, he met me over my place, he ended up fixing my computer(needed to be restored, damn son!), I rewarded him for his superior computer skills with my superior, ummmmm skills...and now we are both walking with a little skip in our step.  Heeee!  The man is wonderful.....I...yeah!  Oh yeah, I did end up getting the daughters plane tickets, she arrives at 1pm the 21st and heads back home the 24th.  Look out Bourbon Street.....you have been warned!

      Yey!! It's Friday....I haven't done a  urlLink Cheddar X  in awhile, so here is my share of the cheezie goo. Yummmmm!   1. What does party mean to you? (I.e. when you go and get your party on, what does that mean?)  Party...means just that.  Having a good time, with yourself, friends, family, whoever.  And making it last as long as possible.  Till I pass out!   2. What was the first thing you thought or said when you saw your significant other for the first time?  You mean Mr. D?  When he stood up and took a step towards me, I was very pleased.  There was a little tickle in my tummy...heheee.   3. Do you talk to yourself? Why?  Yes, I do talk to myself.  Sometimes it helps in the decision making process and if it is something that made me mad, it helps vent it out before I attack the object of my wrath.   4. What's been your biggest personal change in the last ten years?  The development of me.  In the past 10 years I have been divorced(twice), been poor, homeless, vehicleless, unemployed and abandoned.  I have become a stronger person and found love of myself.   5. What are you most looking forward to?  This is an easy question.  More adventures in my life.  Learning and growing with lifes experiences.  Loving and being loved.

      I can not, will not(at least anytime soon), do these things again. I am not allowed.  I am not to set any security/safety/permissions on any databases.  Ever.  I ended up locking myself out of my own database.  I denied myself.  Thanks again Jack, you ARE my  HERO !  I am not allowed to assume I clicked "save my password".  Because I didn't.  Yes, I am a ditz!  I am not allowed to dream I took a sleep-aid.  I wake up feeling like I did.  I am no longer allowed to drive.  Never.  Ever.  Ok, lunch-time drive at 18 miles over the speed limit, never again.  Over a railroad track.  At least that is what the nice police officer, Carl _____, said I was doing.  As he wrote me a ticket.  A TICKET! I have been driving for almost 27 years.  I have never gotten a ticket before.  I. Don't. Get. Tickets! Damn, damn, damn! I was so nerved up, I almost started to cry.  Damn!  Ok, that's it....time to go home!

      Monday night, Dig came by my place.  I was stretched out on the couch, drowsily watching TV.   Earlier my Bro-in-Law had called, excitedly rambling about tickets to the Basketball game.  First stadium row, on the hoop line, right behind the Nicks, do me and Dig want to go with him and my sister?  I called Dig and asked him, after a back and forth, do you want to go?  I called Bro-in-Law back and made an excuse that we were unavailable. So, he arrived.  He played with Tabby and Amber(my cats), while he bent over me and kissed me hello.  Then I got up and we arranged ourselves to snuggle on the couch.  I handed him the remote, content to watch whatever he decided.  Laying there, a bit uncomfortable since two larger people just don't fit on that 1 and 1/2 feet width of couch, just happy to be wrapped up in his strong arms. After a couple position changes, getting up to get some food, he ended up on the couch on his back.  He motioned me to come join him, so I climbed up on top, with my ear to his chest. My eyes drooped.  My thoughts went where they shouldn't.  He then asked if I could handle being like that every night, or something like that and I said I could.  Too much so. He left around 10, since he had an early morning with a promise to see each other the following night.   All night. The anticipation for Tuesday to get over with quickly was great.  Finally Tuesday workday was over and on the drive home I called him to tell him I was on my way.  He was on the 15th hole(golf) and would be "home"(his word), as soon as he finished up.  Around 5:30 he was banging on my door.   The evening was filled with comfortableness.  Cuddling, watching TV(movies, regular shows, etc), he dozed with his arms wrapped around me, more cuddling, talking, pizza, some internet surfing, more cuddling and even some lovemaking.  Yes, that's right, lovemaking, it wasn't just sex, it was more.  And it was good and it is good. We eventually settled in for some sleep, he fell asleep first and I finally did too.  After a few minutes of poking him to re-adjust himself to quiet his snoring.  It wasn't really that bad, especially after I found my comfort spot.   Snuggled up against his back, with my legs tucked behind his and my arm around him.    Yeah, I could get used to this.

       WARNING: The following post will have sexual content. You have been warned!      I had been anticipating this moment for days.  I was both nervous and excited.  Earlier I had tried to take a nap, but tossed and turned, I showered and shaved all the vital parts, pits, legs and even the "Uh huhhh".  Lotioned my skin to a baby softness, and dressed myself in a silk purple teddy that just covered my tush.  I applied a light tint of face make-up and did my hair.  Not too much, cuz I knew it would eventually get messed up.  At 12:15am last night, my phone rang.  Dig was pulling in my parking lot.  He arrived.  I greeted him at the door wearing my floor length terry robe, wanting the underneath to be a surprise.  He got the quick tour of the downstairs and I lead him to my room.  He had just gotten off work, so I had a towel ready for him in the bathroom to shower.  He went in to shower and I removed my robe and sat on my bed waiting patiently for him to come back. I heard the shower turn off and soon heard him enter behind me.  I turned and was instantly turned on by this man.  He stood in my doorway with nothing on but a smile and a red thong.  After a nod of approval he climbed up behind me and I was treated by a massage.  He rubbed my shoulders, my neck and my upper back.  I was putty in his hands, it felt so good. This graduated to greater things.  I was soon straddling him, he cupping my breasts as we kissed.  Me grinding on him, feeling little twinges of life starting to wake up down below. I then relieved him of his little red fabric of delight and he was enjoying a warm welcome.  Though he didn't let me stay down there for very long.  He repositioned me on to be on my back.  His hands and mouth were everywhere.  I felt the heat building up and the desire to release it was strong.  I didn't want it to be over, my brain stalling the finish. He moved and climbed up on top of me.  The feel of him slide in was as close to heaven as I had felt in a long time.  His hands and warm breath on my face.  This was good. We ended up taking a break.  Holding each other, talking and then the mood change back.  Before I knew what was really happening I was on my back again.  He slid himself in a position that was common, but then he slid his arms up.  Cupping a breast in each hand.  I felt his tongue flutter across my clit and I knew there was no stopping it.  I felt my core open up.  My body started to shake.  He held on.  And a loud moan escaped me.  I think I screamed, hollered.  The shaking continued as every nerve in my body exploded.  I couldn't catch my breath.  He stayed there, playing, teasing until I begged him to stop.  I needed to come down, the high was intoxicating. He did stop.  He rested with me.  I felt my body coming back to me as we laid there with the feel of his fingers rubbing up and down my arm, the beat of his heart against my cheek and the hum of his voice in my ear.  Over the next couple of hours a few more positions were experimented with.  I think the favorite for both of us was him behind me.  He has spanking down pretty good, since my ass was a nice shade of red a few times.    I could have had that man stay with me all night.  But, it was soon 4am and he had to go.  I still need a couple hours sleep.  I walked him out and climbed up the stairs to my room with a skip in my step.  My adrenaline was pumping and I knew I wouldn't get to sleep. So, after making sure I had set my alarm, blew out the candles and tucked myself in, I laid there with my eyes wide open.  After a few minutes I told myself that if I didn't fall asleep in 45 minutes, I was gonna just get up and go to work.  That was my last conscious thought.  I didn't even hear the alarm.  I was dreaming that Dig was still with me.  I could feel his lips on me, I could smell him.  As I slowly came awake, I noticed it was very light in my room, I drowsily thought to myself that it shouldn't be light out.  Ohhh, I overslept, and as I peeked over the covers and looked over, the clock said 8:30 and with a smile I removed the red thong that had been draped across the nightstand.  Yeah, I was late for work, but who cares!

      The weekend was/is fabulous.  Friday, lunchtime, Digger called me.  I was on my way to lunch with the crew,  urlLink J ,  urlLink W ,  urlLink K  and Jack.  We talked for awhile and I told him to meet me there, at the restaurant.   I asked him if he was alright with that and he replied with, he was gonna meet them anyhow, may as well get it over with at one time. So he met us there, and it was pretty cool.   I liked seeing him again. After lunch, he walked me over to the car and promised to call me later. And he did.  We ended up talking for a couple hours over the night.  Before I went to the VFW to see my mom, then as I drove to Legend's to meet up with J, again while I was at Legend's, the drive home and again to say good-night. Saturday was torture. He slept all day while I went to a BBQ.  The food was good, the company(well some was good).  But then I became overheated(it was hot out there), so I left early and went home to take a nap. I felt much better after.  I ended up singing.  It was Saturday night, ya know.  I had a good time.  Janet showed up, and J, and even Maggie(another singer, who had adopted me as her friend).  I got a little of a boost in confidence as I walked away from the singing area after my last song.  One of the regular singer guys came up to me and said, "You know, your voice, it's really good to hear you sing." He was probably just flirting, but that's ok.  Made me feel good.  And now today.  After I finish writing this, I am going to take a nap.  Dig is coming over after work tonight.  You would think that 3 hours today was enough.  Meeting my family.  Being tortured by them.  No, he wants more.  But then so do I, so hey, it's a good thing.  Know what the best part is?  I dropped my bother off at the airport this morning.  My son is away till next Thursday.  I have the entire house to myself!

      I eventually made it to my date last evening.  I wasn't late, I arrived at 7:27 for our 7:30 meeting.   We were to meet at a restaurant in Fat City, famous for their Steaks and mashed potatoes.  Famous for their very liberal seasoning of garlic on and in everything.   I know, great place for a first date. Anyway, I get there, park and climb out of my car.  Pulling on my skirt, cuz it road up a bit, and running across the street to the restaurant, I hear a holler come from a car passing me.   "Work it baby!" Of course this causes me to blush, and then I lose confidence in what I am wearing.  I thought tasteful and flirty.  Black push-up lacy top, my cranberry suede shirt(unbuttoned to the cleavage), a denim skirt(just above the knee) and my knee high boots with the 3 1/2 inch heals.  Real conservative right? I walked in to the bar area and he stood up.  My doubts faded as he greeted me with a smile, a hug and a peck on the cheek.  And within minutes, my nervousness was gone.   I was amazed at how totally comfortable I felt just sitting next to him. We sat there at the bar, talking and waiting for our table. Not a long wait, maybe 5 minutes or so, and we were seated at our table.  It didn't take long for me to decide, This girl wanted steak.  The server came up and asked what I would like.  "12 oz, sirloin, medium/rare, please",  I said with a smile.  He looked at me and said he wanted the same and then said he was a little freaked about that, cuz it was not usual to find a woman that liked the same as he.   We talked more, thru an appetizer and then thru dinner.  He complimented me on my smile, of course pointing out the dimples.   I kept looking at him, amazed that this handsome man was out with me.  Listening to him talk, watching his face light up when he smiled at me.  The slight curve in his nose, kind chin(Hmmm), the way his eyes sparkled.  Just sexy. (Whooo, getting heated up again just thinking about it) After dinner we went to the park, walking a little ways around the pond and sat on a bench.  He joked about watching the "Submarine races", HaHa.  The conversation continued.  No real uncomfortable moments.  No pauses in anything.   We ended up leaving the park, for a drive and a stop at yet another park.  And a Pepsi, cuz I was thirsty.  Funny thing kissing does, ya know.  The time had come that I needed to head home, so he drove me back to my car.  I had asked him to come over on Monday, to watch a "movie".  He accepted the invite and he asked for my address.  He then asked if there was an apartment number.  Yes, I said.  D.

      It's just after 5pm and I am stalling, getting ready for my date. Is it a date?  I would classify it as so.  He is taking me to dinner.  As for after, who knows.   He called me this morning and chatted with me while he was still snuggled in his bed.  He admitted his nervousness and I did too.  We talked about tonight.  Expectations or the lack of them.  What I would be wearing or not be wearing (hmmm, sorry not this time).  And we talked about stuff, stuff new acquaintances talk about, stuff that is mundane and even seriousness. I had to hang up because of a meeting I was required to go to and kept myself busy for the rest of the day.  No time to think.  Now....well....I really hate first dates.  Wish me luck.

      Last night I took my momma to a play.     urlLink Chicago, The Musical .  We sat in Row Q, seats 5 and 7.   Translation: 17th row, left center, two seats from the aisle.  In the beautiful  urlLink Saenger Theatre  in downtown New Orleans.  We arrived at about 7:30, for the 8 PM show, bought our wine, found our seats and anxiously awaited the show. I found myself excited, giddy with the anticipation. The lights finally dimmed and the show began.  I sat on the edge of my seat during the entire production.  Close to the end, I felt a whoop wanting to escape me, but I told myself that proper southern ladies didn't voice their pleasure by shouting a "woot" while in the "Theatre". So, as the curtain came down and we stood and clapped, from my right I heard a loud "Whooo hooo!".  I glanced over and my momma was practically bouncing up and down, clapping and hooting.  I guess southern ladies do "woot" after-all.

      The last two nights I have been talking to a man.   It all wouldn't be a big deal, but I really like talking to him.  He has a nice voice, almost like purring in my ear. (Wait till he reads that)   He also makes me laugh.  Sometimes to the point of my cheeks hurting from the effort.  I sent him to this site and he has pretty much read the entire blog, all the way back to July.  He likes it, most of it anyway, and told me I write very well.   Eeeh, when I really apply myself.  He told me I probably didn't have to work very hard at it.  Last night he voiced his observation and concern that I am down on myself alot. This is true.  I am and I know I shouldn't be.  It's just really hard to get out of that and lose it forever.  After so many years of being told you are worthless, incapable, ugly, tapped-in-the-head, and have so many demeaning actions done to you that you actually believe them to be true.   I would say that 75% of the time, I am ok with myself.  I am strong and confident.  I feel beautiful.  I am smart and have all my shit together.  But then there are the times, when I am alone.  I can't figure out why I am alone.  No partner, no friends around, just me.  And I wonder if maybe they were right.  It's a good thing he is taking me to dinner tomorrow.  Or I'd be really depressed.

      I picked up my  urlLink pictures .  Yey! I set up a page on Geocities, so they can be viewed easily.  And after all that I went thru to get them, I have sort of lost interest in writing about the adventure.  Maybe tomorrow...  Ok, back to AI...........later ya'll.

      I went to Walgreens after work.  I was calm.  I was courteous.  I asked for my pictures.  After 15 minutes or so, the kid (not the one that took my roll last night) found them.   He found my pictures!!  Here is the bad part.  They hadn't developed them yet.  The negatives were still hanging on the envelope.  After a slight confrontation I walked out of the store, with no pictures, grumbling. I am happy they had been found, but you think maybe they would have developed them.  Grrrr!  So, what did I do?  I called my Mommy and she called the manager and now I have free pictures.  Yey!!  Free pictures make me happy...but, you have another day to wait til you see me on the back of a horse. Hee!

       Warning:  This post will contain swearing, because I am still fuming!  It's Monday and I really should have stayed in bed.  It started out crappy and I see no signs of it improving as quickly as I would like.  My Son was dragging his butt and we didn't get on the road till 10 after 7 this morning.  Then he slept the entire way to his work.  I asked him if he thought he stayed out too late for a school night, to which he responded that he forgot to adjust his clock forward.  I said, "No, you dumb ass, it was you staying out till the wee hours of the morning on a fucking school night"  "Now I am going to be late for work"  Then I told him it was gonna stop and he was buying his own car and he would be responsible for it.  Like an adult.    So I am on my way to my job, finally.  Some retard decides to hit a city bus on the Huey.  The traffic was backed up to Airline Hwy.  Thank you dickwad!  I love sitting on that bridge, as it sways and shakes.  I love having a damned panic attack with visions of the bridge breaking when I am stuck on it.  And that stupid visor they put on the driver's side of your car.  It is a waste of space.  It doesn't block the sun so you are sitting forward, looking like a granny trying to see over her steering wheel.  The morning gets better. As I am sitting on the bridge, about to freak out and run screaming from my car.  My phone rings.  It's the lady I do demos for on the weekends.  It's 7:30 in the morning.  What the Fuck?  She then apologizes for calling so early(Thought: Then why did you?)  She wanted to know if I wanted to work this weekend.  All weekend, even Friday. I said, "Ok, look.  I have a job.  I work Monday thru Friday."  She told me she knew that, but wanted to know if I wanted to earn some extra.   I asked her if she really thought I would not go to my regular job that pays, lets say, a hundred bucks a day and go hand out free samples to greedy people all day and only take home 48 bucks. She told me to think about it.  Yeah, I thought about it alright.  I have this weekend off, Yeah!  I finally get to work.  I pull up to the lot and a security guard informs me that the lot is already full.  I look out at the sea of cars and very loudly voice my outrage.  Not only do I have to park in the lot behind the building next to mine, I end up at the other side of that lot.  So, I am now parked probably 400 to 500 yards from the entrance of my building.   Don't get me wrong, the walk usually wouldn't hurt me.  But my ass hurts, my legs hurt, and that fatty area under my cheeks....Please, give me something!! The parking situation has to change.  I really believe the temp workers should have the off-site parking and the regular people should have on-site.  Easy to regulate too.  A sticker on the windshield would solve it.  But Hell no, that would require the "Guards" to be outside and checking vehicles.  Guards outside, in the guard shed.  Who would have thought that that was the purpose of that little building?    So I finally get in the office.  Gingerly sit.  Do a few things on the puter.  Usual gossip.  Blah, Blah, Blah. I then decide to check out why my Tripod is down.   They dumped me.  Can ya believe it?  No notice required, no explanations required.  Bu-Bye!  So I have lost all my pictures, my Heading, my description.  All gone.  I was stupid, no back up.  I recently deleted it from my hard-drive, because of a space problem.  Never thinking something would happen.  It did and now I get to start over. So, over the next few days, I will be working on it.  Sorry if it looks bad.  It will be better, as soon as I get to it.  Now, last bitch....................Walgreens lost my pictures.  I dropped them off last night to be developed.  They called and asked what I dropped off.  Ummm, film!  They then asked what were the picture of.  My horseback riding trip.  I asked what happened.  The kid on the other end of the phone meekly replied that he misplaced the roll.  I screamed, "You what?"  And then I hung up on him.   Hopefully I will be calm enough not to strangle the pimply-faced kid, when I go over there this evening.  I want my pictures!!  I bruised my ass for those, damn it!  I am done! Thank you!

      Last night at the VFW, Lenny walked by me and stopped.  Then he turned around and said, "Hey Vix, you been working out?  You look, so, so......" "Busty?", I replied.  He turned red and nodded his head.  With a big smile I denied working out(Shit, me work out?) and explained it was the new bra. {Woot!}  This morning I was talking about my experience at a hair salon. About how the very flamboyant hair dude wanted to frost the tips of my hair to give it depth and definition.  A woman in my cube turned around and told me that my hair color was beautiful and not to dye it. My color comes out of a box already, I said.  She was taken aback by that and said I should keep on doing what I am doing, cuz it looked great. {Cough, I will take your advise, Cough}  Lunch today was a hoot.  Thanks W, I will always remember "Out like a Kite".    And lastly, my stupid Horrorscope said for me to be very, very nice at work today, even if it the last thing on earth I want to do.  I would be richly rewarded for my efforts. So I was nice and didn't get too sarcastic with anyone and this morning Jack gave me a chocolate/peanut butter slim-fast bar. That's rich alright!

      At seventeen he enlisted in the service.  Bound and determined to make something of himself. He did. He was a soldier. He was a husband. He was a father. He was an American Hero.  I bid goodbye to my good friend Lionel who passed away late last night at the young age of 74. I will miss you, the boys at the VFW will miss you, your friends and your family will miss you. Be at peace!  Lionel B. 08/29/29 - 03/31/04

      Yesterday I took the day off of work. I wanted a mental health day, plus it was my Spanish Chica's Birthday.  The day started with a grumble from Son.  I drive him to work everyday.  So even though I did not have to be anywhere till 8:30, I got up at 7 to drive him.  He practically yells at me, cuz he is going to be late.  Then puts me on a guilt trip.   He said to me.....Ohh, you don't have to go to work today, so you don't care that I am going to be late. I almost pulled the car over and told him to get out and walk.  But no, of course not.  Instead I kept my mouth shut and drove him to work like a good, submissive mommy would. Grrr, I hate when I do that!  After dropping the arrogant, Portuguese, jerk-off (Son) at work, I went to the coffee shop and wallowed in my double-tall-whole-Cappiacino and cinnamon Raisin Bagel.  I watched the cars drive by and after a few minutes I felt better.  They(the drivers of those cars) were on their way to work and I was sitting enjoying the sun on the outdoor patio of CC's on a Wednesday Morning.  The Chica called to tell me she was on her way and she soon showed up at CC's.  She grabbed a coffee and we were on the road.  She was hearing noises coming from her muffler and wanted the dealership to look at her car.  So, first stop was her dealership to drop her car off.  After paper work signed and noise pointed out, we were off to my dealership for an oil change and tire rotation. Chica got in my car and I handed her a goody bag of gifts.  First, a candle I made. The glass holder was a beer mug I acquired in Belgium.  It was a brew called delirium or delirious(brainfreeze, can't recall the exact name), with pink elephants all over it.  Gel Candle was made from a kit that Chica gave me for Christmas(Craft made does not count as regifting) and I included 25 pennies in the base of the candle.  It came out pretty cool.  Also included in the bag was a spoon of chocolate/raspberry for coffee stirring, coffee mints and a Starbucks gift card.  Yey!  She liked it all.  It took about an hour for my dealership to finish my car and by 11 we were on our way to lunch.  We ended up at the "Shimmy", which came highly recommended by co-workers of mine.  We sat on the deck in the far corner.  The sun was warm and the breeze felt good.  We did not appreciate the uninvited guest(a wasp) that kept dive-bombing us, but the nice looking waiter, Alan, took control and joked that the wasps name was Bob and he didn't eat much. Lunch was delish and the waiter was very friendly.  Chica joked that he was overly so, and thinking on it, unless a waitperson is a friend of mine, I have never been touch by one.  He touched me.  First time a tap on the shoulder like you would a joking buddy and the second a grip with a rubbing thumb at the collar-bone.  With a wink he said to come back.....soon. We laughed on our way back to the car, Chica teasing me, waving her finger and telling me to leave the waiter alone. I swear I will be nice.  Maybe.  :-)  On the way back to Chica's dealership, she jokingly said, "I do believe you have been thru the alphabet".  I argued that I hadn't and she began to recite the letters.    This is not the complete list, but you will get the idea: A=None that I remember, B=Brian, C=Curtis, D=David, E=Eric, F=Frank, G=Gilbert, H=Henry wanted to, I said No, I=Irv, J=John, K=Keith(Sorry, different one K), L=Lewis, M=Mike, N=None at this time, O=Not that I know of, P=Paul, Q=Nobody with this letter either, R=Robert, S=Steven, T=Nope, no T's, U=No U's either, V=Vinny, W=William, X=Does anyone know someone with a letter X name?, No to Y and Z.   Chica got quiet, then she said, "Damn girl, that's more than half the freakin alphabet!"  Then very quietly I mumbled to her, "The waiter could be my A".  Ohhh the laughter...I guess you had to be there.  Turned out to be an ok day.  Chica's car is still making a noise, since they found nothing wrong with it at the dealership.  She didn't like their answers, so she is getting a second opinion.  I washed my car when I got home and found some gouges on my rims and a scrape on the drivers door of my 9 month old car.  I called the dealership and let them know and they will be "Inspecting" the damage on Saturday morning.  Isn't that all just Fabulous!  Then, other than being floored by the voting results on "AI" and my dad trying to scalp himself with the corner of the house, there wasn't much excitement after that.    And that was my Hump Day!

      A little while ago, I signed online to check my Email and of course there was mail. So I click the little button just as a pop-up notice comes on the screen telling me I have a "Yahoo Personal" mail. Yeah, I have a personal ad.  Not that I use it anymore, but it's there and sometimes I get some really funny proposals.  Anyway, I click over to check out who sent me a message.  When the profile came up on the screen I started to shake.  It was the Mortician.   The one I went out with for three weeks last spring. The one that whispered "I Love You" in my ear when he thought I was asleep. The one who's apartment I snuck out of at 2 in the morning buck naked cuz I didn't want to make any noise and wake him. The one that called me last Christmas crying on the phone wanting to know what happened to us.  What the fuck!  Not sure what I can do about it, the mail only read , "Nice Smile", he hasn't threatened me, he just pops up every few months.  Let's me know he is there, kind of like heat rash.  Irritating! Any advise?

      I have been desperate for some time away for weeks. No kids, no work, no family, no VFW and no stupid crap.  So, yesterday I told my family I was going away for the weekend.  Out of town.  Not available.  No phone calls please.  I am not going away and that's the best part.    Last night Digger got his boat and picked me up.  We stopped and got gas, water and ice and headed to the boat launch.  He backed the boat in the lake and moved the truck and trailer to the lot while I guarded the boat and held the rope.  He sauntered over, jumped in the back of the boat and started to get things ready to cruise out.  "Snag"  The front light wouldn't go on and after a few minutes of tinkering with it and three blown fuses, he became loudly angry. I wanted to just laugh at the irony of it all.  With all the crap that has gone on all week, why have a smooth evening, huh?  Anyway, we got the boat loaded back on the trailer and went back to my place.  It was suffering, but we entertained each other for the night. Making mad sex into the wee hours of the morning, until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore, until I was to the point of delirium and mumbling to myself.  I am not sure what time he left, I didn't want him to go and I know he didn't want to leave, but that's the way it is.   Stay tuned for - Upcoming posts about the rest of my "Vacation"

      I booked out of work early today.  Enough of the crap, enough of the hum-drum boredom.  I must say though, I have been initiated into the "Bad-Girl" club.  I was reprimanded for my outfit I wore today.  Actually, my dad(he is my supervisor) came over to my cube and whispered, "You are wearing shorts".  I looked down and said, "Well, by-golly I am", "who told you?" Apparently, someone on the other side of the room(about 50 feet away from my cube), was offended by my Khaki shorts. My response to my supervisor was, "Well, women were shorter skirts than these shorts on a regular basis."  He agreed, but asked I not wear them again.  I said fine, I wouldn't, but I was gonna wear a skirt to my navel on Tuesday.   He walked away shaking his head, cuz he knew I would figure out who reported me and I was gonna wear a shorty skirt, commando and do jumping jacks in her cube.  And I did figure out who it was and she just has to get over herself.    Lunch time we(me, Keith, Jenn, her mom and digger) met up with Jenn.  We made her get in her wheelchair and we raced her across the street to our favorite greasy spoon.  Dot's Diner. Fabulous, breakfast for lunch is always the best.  We had a great time, catching up for Keith and Jenn since they haven't seen each other in over a week and laughing it up like old times. Jenn is having a hard time dealing with her injuries, but she will make it.  She just has to realize that you can't heal a broken/operated on knee in a week.  It takes time and slow time too. The wheelchair will help getting her around better and hoping she will be more herself soon.  I left the Diner and went over to a sleazy bar for a job interview.  My raise wasn't what I had hoped and if I want to get anywhere, I need more funds.   I get to the bar and the owner has obviously been drinking.  I can deal with it, his out bursts and swearing, even his nasty flirting.  He asks me a few questions, nothing pertaining to bartending, but bookkeeping and how I came to live in the New Orleans area. That done he asked when I was leaving my present job.  I replied that I wasn't and I wanted a second job.  He immediately became a different person.  He demanded that I tell him what hours I could work and before I could finish my reply he accused me of being a "Cherry-picker". A "Cherry-picker" is someone that picks the prime days and nights to work for the best money. I restated my hours available, which I said, "I need to be at my first job from 7:30am to 4:30pm, so nights, weekends and holidays are available." He told me good luck, that nobody was gonna give a newbie the prime slots, that you have to earn them. I got up, gave him my card, told him if he needed anyone that  actually  worked, to give me a call. He said he wouldn't need anyone and I told him that that was obvious.  Cherry-picker....my ass, since when is Monday night a cherry night?  Dink!

      Plan for today was to go home after work, change into something comfortable and head over the restaurant where the cute girl works.  I sent D an Email to meet me after work, I needed a little sugar and a pep talk. As I waited in the parking lot of the designated spot, my phone rang. Son asked me to pick him up after work, the time he said was for 5 O'clock.  I said sure, it was on my way and I knew it wouldn't interrupt my original plan. Not 2 minutes after I hung up with him, my mom called.  She wanted to know what time I needed to be picked up to go to my niece's Graduation.  I think I said "Crap" out loud.  She immediately coped an attitude telling me, if I had more important plans then not to bother.  Grrrrr. I waited 15 minutes for D, I finally figured he didn't get my Email and wasn't showing.  So I headed out because I was getting short on time. As I hit Power Blvd, my daughter called and needed to be picked up, she was actually on my way too, so I said for her to be waiting outside or I was driving by.  My time was getting thin. Then D called and wanted to know where I was.  He was at our meeting spot and waiting.  At that point I was about to burst into tears. I felt like everyone wanted me everywhere all at the same time and I was slipping into insanity. D said not to worry about him and to try and have a good night anyway. I picked up graduation present for the niece, my daughter, ended up driving her boyfriend to work, went to the pick up place for my son and after 30 minutes he called and said he was getting a different ride. Fantastic....it was already 5:40 and mom was picking me up at 6:15.  I still needed some food, a change of clothes and to wrap the present. I did it though, I was ready and waiting(she was late).   I must say, the graduation was great.  I am glad I went.  There is only one kindergarten graduation for a child and if you miss it, she will let you know about it.  As for the cute girl.  I stopped by the restaurant on my way home.  She wasn't there.  I don't know if she had been and left for the evening already or she just wasn't working.  I was to chicken to ask.  I think things turned out for the best tonight.  If I had gone over to the restaurant and she wasn't working, I may have been disappointed.  This way, I at least saw Caroline sing and dance and get her little diploma.  Sometimes Family obligations are more important.  Saturday, there will be no Family obligations.  I have already informed those that would listen that I will not be in town all weekend.  Not saying I will be away, I will just be unavailable.  My phone will be off and my car parked down the street.   This is a three day "me" weekend.

      Yesterday wasn't a very good day.  I had kid problems again. When do I not have kid problems? Do I blame the chicken in me on the stress of the day, or do I fess up that I am a plain and simple chicken? I had talked myself into going to the restaurant where the cute girl works.  I was gonna sit at the bar, have a nice glass of wine and maybe a salad and see if she was working.  I was hoping she would be there and I was going to force the courage I know I have someplace and give her my number. But instead my stomach turned to mush and I stayed home and watched "AI". I did think about her last night.  I analyzed why she is constantly in my thoughts.  My conclusion was that yes, I would be thrilled to have sex with her.  But it is more than that.  She is beautiful and full of sunshine.  It excites me to just think about her smile.  I want to talk to her.  I want to know who she is. Bottom line, if that is all I get, I know I will be blessed. So, tomorrow(can't today, I have a VFW meeting), I am going.  And I will meet her. I hope I don't make a fool of myself.

      What a weekend! T's 21st birthday was Saturday and of course it was celebrated to the max.  Mom and I took her to lunch at the Olive Garden.  Simple and light, soup and salad, an appetizer and ever flowing wine.  The staff there was great, they sang to her, embarrassed her, but she loved it. On our way out I stopped in front of this boy (a boy that all thru lunch had been walking past our table, eyeing my daughter and smiling at me when I caught him looking) and I told him that we were having a party for T at the pub at 8.  That he must come by.  He said he would and he did. T had a wonderful night.  We played pool, sang karaoke and danced.  Not all that had been invited came, but we made due with what we had.  Towards the end of the night the flirting came in full swing.  T's new boyfriend, Brad, had asked her to come by his place, to watch movies and for me, I had a couple hit on me. They wanted me to go home with them and to play with them and another guy.&nbsp; Ok, the other guy was older than my father.  I couldn't help myself, I busted out laughing.  Though I did take the entire situation in as a compliment and I would do something like that, but Ummm, no!  Not with them. I had to say "no" several times.  It seemed they didn't understand.  I finally had to tell them that if I did go home with someone it would be with the brunette at the bar.  After that they finally left me alone and they went home.  As for the brunette....Yes, she came again.  I again forgot her name.  But I know where she works now and as I was walking up to her to give her my card, she leaned over and kissed the guy next to her.  Not that that is a bad thing, I just didn't want to interrupt her date.&nbsp; That would have been rude.  I will do it though, I will get up the nerve to give her my number and I will get her name and I won't forget it.  I will be having dinner at her restaurant this week.

      Is it Friday yet?  Oh it is, finally. What a week!  I am not complaining, I have loved the time spent with the one I was with.   urlLink Jenn , driving her around, to work, to doctors, to hospital for tests(she will eventually post about it, it's her story), kids, airport twice in a week, driving, driving and more driving!(3 hours in the car today!). I will say again, T.G.I.F.  Today I was at the airport for the second time this week, yesterday I picked up my parents and today Jenn's Mom.   We got there early, had to do the loop 3 times, but we ended up finding her mom.  We did do the rendishon of "Are you my mommy" a few times and Jenn...you are getting that book as a get better present, you will love it. Anyway, I got Jenn and her mom to her house, they wanted to take me to a late lunch, but my day was tapped already.  So I headed out and picked up daughter, went to Wally World, spent a whopping 185 bucks, had a fight with son on the phone, pick his ass up and headed home.  Took son to bowling, had dinner and baked a cake. Then... I gave my daughter her birthday present, ok her birthday is Saturday, but I couldn't wait. I got her a stereo.  One of those portable ones.  5 CD changer, clock, remote, storage case, detachable speakers, etc.  I got a deal.  Clearance, 38 bucks...she knows, she don't care.  Come on, I am having a party Saturday too...  Yes, a party, Saturday.  At the Pub.  To celebrate my daughter turning 21. Crap I am old.  I will write more tomorrow, that is when the real stress begins....Ha!

      Monday Night Story hour will not be interrupted this week.  These past two weeks have been trying.  So I am going to make my mind blank and go far off into the memory and share.....  This weeks sharing is brought to you by the lusting of a tall brunette with full lips and big round eyes.  Her name was Cathy.  She was kind of petite.  Standing about 5'4", smaller framed than me(I think she wore a size 7).  What caught my eye was her long curly hair.  Dark, chocolate brown and really kinky curly.  It fell to the middle of her back and was as soft as silk.  She had the blue-est eyes, like the sky and they always sparkled. I am not going to go into how I met her.  Just that I did and she knew I was interested in more than friendship. She asked me to go slow, be her friend and I did.  For months I was slow and it was agonizing. Then one night, she was over my house.  We had been drinking wine and goofing off in the hot tub.  She got shy and I backed off, then she asked if she could shower.  I told her where all the shower stuff was and she climbed out. I stayed in the hot tub and gazed up at the bathroom window.  I probably shouldn't have, but I watched her thru the curtain.  I saw her hands glide thru her hair, I could see her bend back and rinse the shampoo out.  The silhouette of her body bent over and turned the water off and a groan escaped me as I saw her climb out of the tub.  I sat outside for quite some time and after awhile I realized it had been a long time and she had not come downstairs.  So I ventured inside, stripping off my wet bathing suit and donning a robe.  At the bottom of the stairs I peered up and saw that the light was on in my bedroom.  I slowly climbed the stairs and at the top I opened my door the entire way.   I was greeted by the sight of Cathy asleep in my bed.  She was wearing a robe and laying on top of the covers.  She looked peaceful and content, I really didn't want to wake her, she was just so beautiful. I quietly walked up to the bed and I bent over and kissed her.  I couldn't help myself.  Her eyes fluttered open and she smiled.  I took the act of her licking her lips as an invitation and the next thing I knew we were in each others arms.  Her lips tasted like cherries and I was starving.  I didn't want to ever stop.   I finally did pull away and when I looked into her eyes I saw disappointment.  I asked her if she was ok with all that was happening and as she said yes, she grabbed my hand and put it where she needed it to be. Needless to say the rest of the night was filled with everything but sleep and I fell in Love with her that night.

      I spent the day with  urlLink Jenn  today.  I picked her up this morning and we went to the VFW for lunch.  There was a function, we ended up not dressed properly, but we were served lunch anyway and I ended up working as bartender for about an hour.  After we headed for the bookstore for coffee and empty-headed readings of magazines and fantasy shopping.  I did get Son a GED for Dummies prep book.  I figured the 20 dollar investment may result in his diploma and his ability to do something with his life besides sleeping on my couch.  I also copied a few sites down of possible shopping.  In the future from myself to myself or suggestions to butter me up or show the love...heheeee.  urlLink Jewels, Jewels ,  urlLink Lip Plump Goo ,  urlLink Macara ,  urlLink Serendipity 3 ,  urlLink Lip Gloss ,  urlLink Black Cherry Nail Polish ,  urlLink Cocktail Collection ,  urlLink Tank's ,  urlLink Name Belt  and  urlLink Affordable Elegance .

      As usual my night with Digger was filled with excitement, passion and bliss.  And I won't apologize for waking this morning with thoughts in my head full of a girl.  We met up with my family for some food, had some quiet time at my place before Tanya had to be picked up from work and then we ended up at the pub.  I finally got to sing with him there.  Though the sound system was bad, he said I was pretty good, even though my nerves were all a jumble.  My songs were finished and we were sitting at the bar when I saw her.  I have seen her before, she is there almost every Saturday night, at least for the last month or so she has.  I don't know her name, but I should have remembered it.  She had sung a few weeks ago and blessed us with her smokey rasp of a voice.   I kept glancing at her, trying not to be obviously staring.  I just had to keep looking.  She is beautiful, with her short brown hair and rounded face.  Her big eyes and full lips.  A smile that lights up the room. Then she stands and I almost swoon, all legs, tall and a butt to die for.  She glances my way and we make eye contact, her full lips form a smile and I smiled back. Time to go, before I get up the courage to make a fool of myself. (I did make a mental note to find out where she worked, I may have to stalk her for awhile.) Digger and I left, he knew I was oggling her.  I think he was even turned on by it.  I will have to oggle more often, the after sex is awesome.

      I am so excited!  Ok, partially excited. The Email posting worked...YEY!  Now I can Email a post from anywhere I want, heheheheeee!  The story as to why I am excited: Last week, the knowledge that several people at work had Blog's(Web-Journals) and were posting and reading from work computers became an issue and was demanded to be stopped.   This was done during lunch breaks and down-time, never interrupting the flow of work, so we all thought it wouldn't be a big deal.   Anyway, a complaint was issued, and reprimand's were delivered.  So all posting, reading, surfing, etc. has stopped during work hours, lunch breaks and other empty time during the day. This explains the lack of comments, emails and hits from me.  Sorry people's.  Just remember I have not forgotten you and I catch up on my reading during the evening or over the weekend.

      I am having a really hard time right now.  With kids mostly. This past weekend was a "Big Suck", except for the Saturday I spent with Dig. Being with him is always a joy for me.  Even a few minutes makes me feel good.  Saturday me and Dig spent almost the entire day at the Hilton. (No, sex came later)  He was helping out at a gig.  Setting up for a band, sound.  Huge speakers, lots of them.  Wires everywhere.  And then me, mostly in the way, I at least tried to stay out of the way.   Anyway, they set up, I watched.  I wandered around the place too.  Sitting back, watching people come and go.  Some for conferences, some for dinners, checking in/checking out and there was even a prom. I saw so many gowns and dresses, I started to critique them.  Mumbling to myself if no one was around and whispering to anyone that happened to mistakenly stand next to me. The majority of the gowns were beautiful and elegant.  But then those would pale when the 350 pound woman would walk by in her bright blue sequined number that swung at the middle of her dimpled thighs.   Well, I thought to myself that it was a very bad choice.  I have negligees that cover more.  I was tempted to go up and ask her if it was a costume, a joke, or what was she thinking?  But I didn't, I would just cringe and shield my eyes when she would walk by instead. Dig and I got home around 1am.  Had some enjoyable alone time and enjoyed the closeness until he left.  He makes me feel so good, sometimes I have a hard time letting him go.  But I do and it makes it more wonderful for when I see him again.  As for the rest of the weekend...I am not gonna go into it again. Just that I have been optimistic that it will get better.  That maybe one day I will wake up and want to be in this house, with these people again.  Over the last few days, there have been many times I just want to close my door and scream and cry until I am without a voice and I have no tears left. I really do need to get away from this.  I am seriously being taken advantage of by my children and my boiling point is getting very close to overflow. And Damn it, the freakin Gas prices are so high I can't even afford to fill my tank and take a drive for the day. Just a drive for cripes sake...Anywhere! Somewhere! I really do need a vacation.

      It feels like another typical Sunday.  No special Hallmark moments.  Not that I really thought that would happen, those are TV moments.  Not for real.  I took my daughter to lunch when we went to the grocery.  She gave me a beautiful card.  It was nice. She rarely lets me down. My son however, spent the day sleeping on the couch, then when he woke up, he grumbled that I didn't go off to who-knows-where at 4 in the morning to pick him up.  But of course, in between his grumbles he did say, "Happy Mother's Day".  Bottom line, the day is kind of a disappointment.  The kind that makes you feel tears behind your eyes.  So the rest of my day will be filled with other thoughts. Thoughts of Happy Anniversary.  Since one month ago today, Digger and I met and had dinner at Crazy Johnnie's.  Just a month, seems longer and in a good way. He is one of the best things to ever come into my life and I will cherish it.  Happy Anniversary Baby!  "Allofyou"  I really do.

      I hope all you Mom's, and ones that are Motherly, have a wonderful day today. Enjoy the children, enjoy your pampering. Lounge on the couch and have children wait on you hand and foot. Languish in the spa treatment that was awarded to you by the father of those children. (Because he is so indebted to you for birthing those adorable creatures)  Ahhhh, the fantasy of it...  That's right,  FANTASY!   I am off to the store to get BBQ crap.    HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!!

      I don't know how long this will stay up(as in Posted for all to read), but I just have some things to say.  You are a wonder to me. You are kind and generous.  You treat me with care.  You make my heart so full of happiness, that at times I think I may burst.  I know our limits.  They are memorized.  But I can't help myself.  It is good.  You are good for me.  And all you have given me makes me whole.  Thank you and I Love you.

      Okay!  I am a Bad Mother.  But, We will get back to that later.  First, Happy Birthday Jonathan!  My Son made 19 today.   I say made, cuz.....Okay, just cuz.  I Love him to pieces, but ya know, sometimes I just want to...Grrrrrrrr!  Happy Birthday my Baby ....I truly hope you had a good one!  On another note: I got my car back...Whoo Hoo!  She is all pretty again.  New bumper, new paint job.  They even cleaned her and put gas in her.   I tell ya though, the cleaning crap they used, STINK!  Smells like turpentine!  Had to drive with the windows down.   I thoroughly inspected her and I will be on the phone with the insurance company in the morning.  The carpet in the trunk is my original carpet, the rivets are gone, so it is loose and moving around(buckling) and look awful.  The muffler is still dented and the floor panel still has a wave in it.  So, she will be back in the shop...cuz I ain't happy about the entire job.  Now, here comes the Bad Mother part of the day. I took Jon to dinner.  We went to the pub, he had a Shrimp Po'Boy and I had some chicken fingers.  We played some trivia...We came in last place, whoopee! On the way home he says to me, "Mom, since I may have to be picked up at 4AM from work, why not let me just take the car and you can sleep." I thought, "ohh cool, sure." So I let him take the car and then I called Digger. Digger reminded me of my obligation. Tanya needed to be picked up from work at around 10. Crap! Crap! Crap! I am such a Bad Mother, I forgot I had to pick T up.  Damn it! Now she is mad at me, cuz I had to tell her I forgot.  Of Course she is pissed.  Totally Fabulous, less than a week and I have her all mad at me. Damn it!

      Yesterday was a dream day.  Digger called as he left his house and after a few minutes of conversation, he was picking up T at work and going to the grocery to get the fixin's for the dinner he was cooking.  I walked into the house and was greeted by them both, laughing it up on the sofa's and just enjoying each others company.  Let's not forget the fresh flowers and a card, as well. The tingly feeling you get when something like that happens is indescribable.  Digger's dinner was fabulous.  He is an awesome cook.  And afterwards, the cuddling on the couch and laughter and teasing was better than any dessert.  Sometime during the evening, Digger got all excited about something he was talking about.  He was describing about when he was coming home. Home, as in my house. This is the second time he has said it and he mentioned that too. I hope he understands that this is a good thing. My home is his home for as long as he wants it to be. For home is where the heart is.

      Well!  My "T"(daughter) has been here less than two full days and she is employed.  She worked her first day today, training, as a server at the burger joint that my "Chica" works at. When I picked her up after her shift she was exhausted.  Not from work though.  She went to the mall with her grandmother and they hit the sale racks at Dillard's and gramma ended up making her try on a multitude of dresses.  Both were thrilled with their finds, but T moaned in the back seat of my car, begging me to tell my mom that she was shopped out.    Funny how mom has the knack for that.

      Digger came over last night.  My warm, cuddly man.  He was a worker bee too.  He fixed my slider door, so now it actually slides.  He tinkered with the Beetle, but that was pretty much a lost cause.  It still isn't running right.  Not his fault, she is old, she is decrepit, she is sold to the first taker. We then came back to my place and ordered pizza.  Digger suffering thru A.I. again, like the trooper he is. After the show, the last part of Matrix was on.  My brother turned up the surround sound and I left them to watch in peace. I got ready for bed and could feel myself start to shut down. I fought it for as long as I could, but unfortunately it didn't last long. Digger climbed in bed next to me and my last conscious thought was, "Ohh, this is nice" as I snuggled up to his side and put arm around him.  I know I slept for several hours and when I woke, I was stuck to the mattress cover, since the sheets had shifted off the mattress.  I laid there awake, listening to his rumble(snore) for a few minutes. Then I got up and fixed the sheets, with him rolling over and pointing to the corners on his side.  Part of me wanted to clobber him, but instead I smiled in the dark and climbed back into bed.   Back into his arms.   Back into his warmth. Back to a dream.  A dream that was so real.  His hands in my hair, his kisses on my lips.  A dream where I made love to him with my mouth. In the dream I heard the beeping of the alarm.  I felt him leave the bed and heard him dress.  I switched over to my time on the alarm and I felt him kiss me good-bye.  I felt him come back for more kisses and I murmured my heart to him.

      Today's Monday Night Story Hour will not be a story after all.  The M.N.S.H. that was intended to be told will be postponed until next week.  You see, my daughter is with me.  She flew down here to be with me and to seek support from a family unit that does not criticize.  She came to start her "Life #2" as  urlLink Helen  would say. She is starting new.  She is home.  I left her tonight at my mom and dad's house, all tucked in her new bed, in her new room.  I hugged her and kissed her like she was a newborn babe'. She smiled and a quiet murmur seeped out between her lips as she closed her eyes.  "Thanks Mom". And she sighed.  And that's all I need.  I have my children with me, I have my family and I have Digger.  It couldn't be more perfect.  They fill my heart and I Love Them all.

      *This Post has nothing to do with Bread-Puddin'*  It all started at just before 3 this morning.   The Drama!  My daughter called me, hysterical.  I eventually calmed her down to find out that she had been partying, blah, blah, blah. Her boyfriend came home and fighting ensued. In a nutshell, the relationship was over, she was upset, her and her father were on bad terms and that upset her too.  I got her calmed enough to swear she was going to get some sleep and she would call me in the morning.  At about 11AM, I got "The" call.  She was calling it quits with Cape Cod.  She had no job, no money, no friends(real friends that support you in troubled times) and her father told her she had till the end of the day to get her stuff out of his house or it would end up at the dump.  Though Dig and I were headed to the golf course, he was patient with the entire dramatic scene and waited while I made phone calls and booked a flight to get my daughter situated and in my arms as soon as possible.  T will be here tomorrow at 2:10PM, her possessions(other than the ones she was able to pack) are being stored at My bestest friend Billy's house, Billy is dropping her off at the bus station in the morning, my old boss, Mark, gave her 30 bucks for a bus ticket to Boston/Logan Airport and those two men will forever have my heart because of the things they did and said today.  You guys are wonderful and I Love You both so much!  As for D.  You too were awesome today.  Your patience is astounding.  And Today turned out to be a fabulous day.  Though it started with a stumble and it was cold.  I had the best time with you on the golf course.  Just being with you, no matter what, for me is guaranteed a good time.  {{Hugs}} Baby!

      I learned a few new things today.  And as some of you know, I will share!  1) An  urlLink ASP Baton  is not the same as an ASS Baton.   a) For some reason, maybe it was the accent(Louisiana Mumble),  urlLink Miss J  and I thought the guys, D(My D) and D(Her D), were talking about ASS Batons.  The story being told was about shoving a Baton in the mouth of some guy.  Something about an episode from the TV show  urlLink COPS .  Anyway, J and I were in a fit of giggles.  2) Good Cops don't get wet.   a) This is said by J's date.  Her "D" is a Cop.  Hmmmm.  I know he was talking about rain, but that's not what we were thinking. {Grin!}  3) Miss J is not allowed to have two coffee's with double shots of Kahlua anymore!       a) OK, maybe she is, but tomorrow she will tell me she is not allowed.  Hope you're not feeling too horrid tomorrow.     b) We will go for a coffee, NO KAHLUA, plain coffee.   c) Alright, maybe a Bloody Mary from that place down on Magazine.  That will make you feel lots better!  4) Asparagus is not meant to be there!   a) My D knows what I am talking about.  Don't go there.  Step away from the produce section of your local grocery store.  Danger!  5) If you mouth "Olive Juice", very slowly, to someone on the other side of the room they may think you said something else.   a) Try it.     b) I learned that one from my Bro-in-law.  He is such a dweeb.  And finally, for my D.  "Allofyou" Baby.

      ME...ME....Sometimes I wish I had a tape-recorder to record my thoughts so I can write them down later, but I don't, so this may be a little hard to read.  Up: I went to Chevy's on Thursday and hung out with the usual crew(Amber, J.T, Brandon, Jonathan and Devon) and Dig even showed(He surprised me). I sang( I love the digital system they have there) and then me and Dig headed to my Mom and Dad's to pick up stuff she forgot to pack.  (There were a few things that may have been in the car and I told daughter they may be there, so  might have to get them in the morning).  Down: Some of the things I needed were in the car and when I got to Mom and Dad's on Friday Morning, there was no car, no daughter and no stuff in the house that I needed.  I left a nasty note to daughter, hoping her binge was worth it.  Up: Picked up niece and headed to Lafayette, ahhhhh a vacation!  Down: Rained the entire way to our destination.  18 wheelers like the left lane.  The spray from the road made visibility unbearable.  Took 3 hours to drive 127 miles.  Up: Family there to greet us.  Down: Room rate wrong, room size wrong, rain, no indoor pool.  Up: Niece had a wonderful time.  Niece was in a beauty pageant, she didn't win, but she had a great time.  Down: Saturday, paid 22 bucks for niece to have a banquet dinner.  She didn't eat a bite.  Up: She wanted McDonald's.  People at table saved our spots so I could run to McDonald's and get niece food to eat.  She ended up the envy of the banquet because of her Happy Meal.  Down: Sunday Morning, Papa(Grandfather) being sworn in as Jr. Vice Commander ran late.  Left at 12:30pm instead of 11:30am.  Up: Niece practiced her curtsying and hand-wave to win next years pageant while we waited.  Down: Sunday afternoon, Niece got carsick 2 blocks from her mom's house.  Up: I had a baggy ready and she didn't spill.  That was my weekend.  My vacation.    Monday...Back to the grind. Up: I took my car into the dealer.  The engine light problem turned out to be a Caliber thingie.  All fixed now, and I am happy.  I got to work at 10am.    Down: I called the insurance company to get a new card, since some how the state thought my insurance was cancelled. Guess what, it was.  Somehow, there was a mix up, and when my accident in April was closed, they listed my car as totaled and cancelled my insurance.  So, unbeknownst to me, I have been driving an uninsured vehicle for the past month and 1/2.  All fixed now, but I am not happy about that DOWN slope.    Up:  My Dig came by tonight.  He brought me some Vino and gave me some "Q" time.  I really love our "Q" time.  ("Q" does not mean sex, there was no sex, sorry to disappoint).  Down: Dig told me he was having lunch with his dad tomorrow.  At first I was, "Ok, cool".  Then I remembered.  I have a Dr. Appointment tomorrow at Noon.  Don't read this wrong about Dig.  Yes, I am sad he won't be at my Dr. Appointment with me, but he needs to go see his dad.  That is more important.  This may be nothing...Change that...This will be nothing.  Ok another Down: I am scared as hell.

      I have done a lot of thinking today.  I thought rashly about how to solve the issues at hand earlier today.  My first resolution was to immediately change my domain name or give it a different URL address.  My second idea was to take down the site completely.  Taking the site down is not something I want to do.  I love this site, I have worked very hard at getting it the way I want and have dreams of how I can make it even better one day.  Changing of the domain name is more the possibility.  Though today happened to be the day that the automatic renewal took affect, so I have "Heavensvixen" for another year.  This is not a problem, I can just keep it and get another one.  I am going away this weekend, so I am going to take the time and think some more about what I will do.  I will ponder new names.  I will check out other options.  Until then, there will not be any posting and it will give me time to Email the ones that want my new location, if that is what I decide to do.  So until then...Be Good To Yourself!

       Post brought to you by: Yahoo Email.   Apparently the dilemma of my mom reading my site is not the problem my sister faces. She is the one offended.  She has been hurt, angered, offended and judgmental towards me for what I have posted.  She is mortified that her "friends" read my blog. I have been told that her friends call her up and tell her how awful, laughable, humiliating my posts are.  I found this out thru a friend of mine, because my sister for some reason can not approach me and tell me her feelings. Will I get angry with her? No, for pete's sake...her opinion is her opinion, she is welcome too it.  I will repeat what I have said before, My opinion is mine.  I post it.  I am not ashamed of it either.   Advice:  If you don't like what you are reading, STOP READING IT.  I am not forcing you to stop by my site.  This is America, you have choices, I have choices.  I am not breaking any laws.  I am not hurting anyone.  Yes, feelings may have been hurt, that I am sorry about....but this site is not about you, it's about me and my feelings, my hopes and dreams, my experiences, my opinions, that's all.  I will do one thing in consideration.  When I get home later, I am changing the URL.  If you are an avid reader, one that is not a friend of my sister, you can send me an Email and ask for the new link.

      I am feeling a little venomous right now.    Ok, Maybe it's a new bout of PMS.  Well, the full moon is coming up in the next 10 days or so right?  If you hadn't noticed, I cycle with the full moon, so there!  I went to my sister's today, bro-in-law made Gumbo (By the way, it was totally awesome, even the crab shells).  Sis took me out back to see the swing my (16 1/2 week old) nephew needed to get his daddy for Father's Day.  On our way to look at the pool (another necessity my nephew needed), Manda asked if my daughter would become, what's the word, defensive, yeah that's it.  I asked why.  She said if momma(our mom) became confrontational about my daughter's slutty behavior, if she would point out my site. I defended my site, saying, if I was afraid someone would read, I wouldn't have started it in the first place. Manda nodded and said what I had written about, my mother would not like. Her point, about Women.  I have pondered this since I left there (sister's house) and this is what I have to say.   (I know she will read this, she is one of my silent readers, too afraid to post a comment)  I, this means ME, have been thru a lot.  Some people do not believe, most of that I will NEVER post (Those are my own very private demons) and I don't care if you believe or not.  I am very proud of my site, this is how I vent my life's frustrations.  I am very proud of me, I am whole, I am good to myself.  If someone, anyone, even my own flesh and blood, can not accept me for who I have become, naturally and/or because of history, then all I can say is sorry.  This is who I am.  I am not out to hurt anyone on purpose.  I know what pain it can cause me.  I am aware and I am happy and it's about time.  Family...This is me, how do you do?  I just ask that you love me for who I am, cuz I love you for who you are.

      A breakfast for a King was served to my Man this morning.  He overstuffed himself on Eggs, pan-fried potatoes, bacon and toast.    While sitting at the table, he asked me a question.  "Had I ever thought it would work out like this?" (Meaning our relationship) I answered with a no.  In the beginning, I figured I would be lucky to get a night a week.  But to my delight it has developed into two people trying to schedule as much time together allowable.  This has turned into something that is very real.  And very scary.   I go to the baseball games, silently sitting in the stands.  I hoot and holler on the inside as his son's do well.  I swear and rant on the inside when they miss a play. We meet for lunch a few times a week.  We meet in the Mickey D's parking lot after work to talk and hold hands.  We go on outings, like tubing.  He has wormed his way into my friend's hearts, as well as my family's.  He has taken me to the doctor's and he will again.  He holds me at night and makes me feel safe and loved.  Because of all this, I fell in love with him.  He teases me about my freedom to go and do what I want.  Go out with the girls, hang at my local Pub and sing.  He teases me about being flirted with and my freedom to flirt back.  When he says these things, I hear a note of Jealousy, not real big like the "Green Monster", the little kind, the little boy whine kind. I will tease along with him, but after awhile, I get serious.  I tell him that flirting is as far as I care to go.  I don't have any phone numbers given to me and if I did they would go in the trash.  I don't want that and I am not like that.  I am very happy with what I have.    Then today the fear part really reared it's ugly head.  I am afraid I will do what I always do.  Ruin a perfectly good thing.  I have been where I am before, well a little different situation(his status was different).  I have been in the Love, it feels perfect, bliss before.  And then I got scared and I messed it up.  My brain went on a tizzy and thought I would eventually be hurt, so before he could hurt me, I lashed out.  I hurt him.  So, now here I am, in a situation where I know I will eventually be hurt, there are no doubts about it.  My hope is that I have grown enough to realize the feelings and deal better with the emotions.  Be an adult and talk them out together.  Deal with them and move on to just being us.  That's my hope.

      Why is it that people feel the need to push their beliefs on a person?  Why do some people say their "God" can help me if I listened?  I get all tingly inside when I ask them to prove it.  Always, at least to me, they say, "Well the book says".   Yeah, whatever....who wrote that book anyway?  For example, while online yesterday, a man(at least he said he was), supposedly from Nigeria and supposedly a priest, asked me if I wanted to chat.  I was bored, so I said sure. He then went into a speal about church and being poor.  He asked if I was a Christain(I know it's misspelled, he spelled it that way).  I told him No, I was not, that I was atheist. He then told me I was going to hell.  Then, he told me to go see "Passion" and then I would believe. I had had enough and clicked the ignore button.   Like Mel's version is the true story, Please!!!  Now don't misunderstand me, it just wasn't this one guy.  It's all the time.  They knock on your door to hand you a magazine and ask to come in and talk.  I have been handed a booklet at the gas pump, to which I smiled and handed it back(I thanked her for her thoughtfulness though).  I belong to clubs where the "Lord's Prayer" is said, but I respect the other members beliefs.  I bow my head in silence, as respect for them.  I, as someone that does not believe that a spirit, created Earth, made the vegetation, then Adam and Eve, all the animals, the laws and spoke to a select few.  And supposedly made a virgin pregnant.  If you believe it, fine, go ahead.   Just leave me to my beliefs.  I am ok with what I do, how I do it and where.  And one last thing....my forgiveness comes from within myself.  That's all that counts, in the end.

      Had Dig over for dinner tonight and I cooked.  He was skeptical that I could actually work in the kitchen and I teased him all day I was cooking a Tuna casserole and to his surprise when he walked in, the house smelled of delicious food.  I made him a specialty of mine, a casserole yes, but Seafood Casserole, baked potato and biscuits awaited him.  He seemed impressed and when asked, he was most definitely impressed.  I even did the dishes after....I am such the domestic...Bwahahahaha!  Anyway, I am off for dessert....  If you want to impress, here is my recipe: Dinner for two.  3/4 lb  White fish (Flounder, Cod)  Handful of Shrimp 1/2 lb  Imitation Seafood Handful of Scallops if available 1 can Crab meat Ritz Crackers Butter Hollandaise Sauce(In spice aisle)  Heat oven to 350. Melt a stick of butter and mix with a sleeve of crackers and the can of Crab Meat.  set aside. In a casserole dish lay the White fish at the bottom of the dish.  Layer the Shrimp, Imitation Seafood and Scallops.  Top with the cracker mix.   Put in oven and cook for 15-20 minutes.  Make Hollandaise sauce and pour over casserole. Cook for another 5 minutes.    That's it, it's that easy.  Enjoy.

      Saturday, a day I have been looking forward to had finally arrived.  I had my 227 Jell-O shots made, a 6+ pack of Bud Light, My Diet Pepsi, a water-proof camera and a new bottle of 70 spf sunblock.  I was ready!  Digger showed up at my place about 5ish in the morning.  We went back to bed for some "Good Morning" hanky panky, then laid there and talked for awhile.  Too soon it was time to get the stuff together and head out to meet the group we were tubing with.  Before we knew it we were at the river.  Nice ride thru the country/backwoods/Hicksville, holding hands, smiling, just simply wonderful.  Personally I didn't care where we were going, just being alone with Dig was more than a treat.    Well, we unloaded our crap, got our tubes and I slapped on the sunblock.  This is a must, I am a pale Irish woman, I don't tan, I blister and burn and then turn white again to then blister and burn at the next sunny event.  As we floated down the river, it felt lazy.  Occasionally hitting a snag and getting stuck in over hanging branches or a piece of wood sticking up, but no real problems...Until.... Me and Dig were picking up some speed in the water, he was tied to the cooler tube and I was holding on to it.  Well the rope hit a piece of wood and because the current was so strong, I got washed away.  Dig was stuck on the wood and eventually the cooler flipped.  Losing everything in it. I in the meantime had gotten tossed off my tube and had to swim to shore.  I saw stuff floating and hollered to the people still in the water to grab what they could. We ended up losing just a few things, some beers, some pepsi's, a bag or two of Jell-O shots, our sandwich and Dig's favorite shirt. But the booze was saved and me and Dig didn't drown...so all was good and it added a little excitement to the day.  The end of the trip (which lasted about 5 hours) I took off my shoes and socks.  Unfortunately, I got a bit burned.  Crispy fried.  Not like bacon though.  I swear I reapplied the sunblock.  Many times.  Ask Dig, he saw me.  The only place that is really bad is below my knees, which were almost always wet, so I am thinking that the sunblock washed away as soon as I applied it.  I will survive, I have had worse.   Dig and I made it home, after a stop at Wally-World.  We munched on some food, showered and we were both asleep by 9pm.  Ohh, the plans of mass quantities of sex went right out the window.  But that was alright, the bestest part was waking up next to him.   That's always the best....Hmmmmm.  PS: Anyone have a lead on a gray with purple pin-stripes, button down jersey style LSU shirt, size XL, Please let me know.

      I finally met her.  I even sat at a table and talked to her.  Her name is Amber.  Last Saturday night I walked up to her and introduced myself.  She laughed and told me she already knew who I was.    I had just made myself comfortable when her boyfriend came in.  Yes, she has a boyfriend.  Amber got up and went to sing and her man and I sat and talked. I must have one of those faces, the ones that people are comfortable with to talk.  He spilled a lot of information. He told me Amber was 24, the oldest 24 he has even known.  He told me that he was recently divorced and met Amber in Portland, Oregon.  She followed him to New Orleans and they were living together.  He told me she loved him, she loved him more than he is used to.  He told me that he didn't love her as much as she did him.  He also said that he hurt because of this and that one day he knew he would hurt her.  He realized he angered me by his statement.  He looked confused.  I leaned in close, so he could hear every word I said and then I told him what I thought. I told him that he should thank his stars that such a beautiful woman felt something for him.  He should cherish every moment they are together.  And then I told him that if he hurt her, I would find him and he would regret all the pain he ever bestowed upon her.  I then leaned back and took a sip of my beer and smiled at him.  He shifted in his seat and smiled back.    Amber came back to the table, the look on her face told me she knew something happened.  I gave her a nod and lifted my bottle.  She lifted her glass and then giggled like a school girl.  I had enjoyed her company.  She is a sweet girl, very knowledgeable, and easy to be around.  I bid my good-bye's, receiving hoots and waves from the table.  Me feeling proud of myself for having the courage to approach her.  I am glad I did, I think we will eventually become friends.

      The past week has been a trial.  Drama with children and me messing up with finances.  Dig has been there for me for all of it.  He stood by me as I had a break down with my son.  He listened to my whining about my daughter.  He bought my beetle to save me from financial catastrophe.  Dig's 40th Birthday was this past Friday.  We celebrated.  I dragged him to "Second Skin" and made him watch me buy a new crop and a beautiful teal colored vibrator.  Then we headed for "Mr. Binkies" and there was a sale on videos.  5 for 50 bucks...yup, I got 5 new videos.  We have watched three so far....hehehheeeee!  I also gave him a certificate to golf at his leisure and a golf ball gift set.  I know how to make my man happy!!  Since his birthday some issues have come forth, but at this time I won't go into detail. I will just say that Dig has been very supportive and he has been my anchor.  Without him, I would have crumbled.  I will never be able to repay him for all he has done for me.  He makes me feel whole and he makes me feel loved.  And yes, I love him so much, every time I think of him I feel warm.  All over.  He is the best thing that has ever (except for my bratty kids) come into my life.    He stayed with me last night, we made love and I fell asleep in his arms.  He held me until the heat from my body felt like he would burst into flames.  He woke and kissed me good-bye and then he left, only to come back to find his keys and kiss me again.    I dream't of him after he left.  I dream't of what will never happen.  I gave him a gift.  A gift of unconditional love.  I dream't I gave him a daughter.

      A little catching up from my weekend.    I went to the Pub on Saturday, D met me there, which was a surprise.  I had a really wonderful time, but I kept looking at the door. For the "Cute girl". She didn't show.  It was a disappointment, but I was ok with it. I sang for D and we had so much fun.  Sunday I had some "baby time" with my nephew. Who I love to pieces.  He threw a tantrum and I still held him.  He loves to be spanked, a child after my heart. While spanking him, I got into a fight on the phone with my daughter, so my bro-in-law took the baby while I argued with her. We ended up making up and spent the night talking and bonding.  Monday, I ended up at my parents house, cleaning out and finding the carpet in the diningroom.  I was looking for the repair manual for my Beetle, no luck on that, but the trash can is full now.  After that, T and I went to visit my chica....I hadn't seen my chica in a month.  I am such a bad friend.  We filled each others coffers full of gossip and made plans to have dinner next week.  And now it's Tuesday....all is back to happy in my little world and I hope it is in your's too.   PS: I am having dinner at Z's(Cute Girl's work place) on Thursday.  I just have to know her name.

      Last night Dig mentioned that since meeting him I have not posted as often.  True.  He keeps me busy, occupied and not so sexually frustrated that I need to vent out on the computer. This past week has been no exception, though I may become frustrated and post a little more.  Wednesday, there was a little party for D's son, so he went back to the house. He told me he would probably stay there, talk, try and work stuff out. I was supportive. Upon arrival, from his side, he wasn't greeted with any enthusiasm. She greeted him with two cards. One was a belated birthday card, his birthday was June 4th. Inside was one sentence in her own script. Something about not realizing that she had to give him a card to say she loved him. The second card contained a story. (He let me read it and my comment was that there are many counselors out there, she needs to stop playing with them, be honest with herself and get help.) D said she then turned to him and said, "Well?". He said, Well, it's time to go and he left.  Thursday we went to Karaoke at Chevy's, had dinner, a few drinks. D wasn't feeling well, so we made it an early night. It was also the last night he stayed here.  The next morning he went back to his house. She isn't there, she went on vacation. So he is there with just one son till Sunday. We both agreed it would be simpler for him to go there, since he is working nights this weekend.  My inner most thoughts and fears of what this week has brought: This has opened the door to D, that the next time it will be easier for him to leave. And the next time and the next, until one day, he just doesn't go back. Each time he goes back though, will hurt me. Until it doesn't hurt anymore and I won't care either way. Our relationship has grown so much bigger than either of us imagined. To the point that I finish his sentences before he even starts to speak. I would be devastated if it came to me feeling like a doormat. The worst part of all, I can't advise him. I can't tell him what to do. He has to decide on his own, 100%. He must have no doubts about what he is doing or why he is doing it. He must do it for himself.

      You realize it's time for a new bed when you find yourself waking up every time you roll over. The last two night have been absolutely wonderful. But when you put two larger people in a double bed, ugh! Not only is there not much room, it seems that the mattress is even harder/firmer and we both have been waking up stiff and sore. Plus this morning as Dig got dressed, he sat down and groaned, then he looked at me and told me he had to break up with me because I have a sucky bed.  He was just joking.  After work I am going to the store to see about some kind of cushion or something for a temporary fix, maybe that will hold us over until I have time to go try out new mattresses.

      I finished up with my tests today.&nbsp; At least I hope so.&nbsp; I really have had enough of the needles, shockwaves and X-Ray tubes, thank you.&nbsp; I felt like a junkie when I left the lab this morning.&nbsp; Though there were only two needle marks in each arm, this is not a normal everyday occurrence for me.  But then if you really think about it, I can't stand needles.&nbsp; I hate shots with a passion.&nbsp; To the point I will start to cry before they even come near me with one.&nbsp; But I will sit for hours as "Tom" does a tattoo, I even fall asleep.&nbsp;  I guess it boils down to something I once heard and I say on occasion.&nbsp; "Pain without reward, is just suffering".&nbsp; I don't know where I heard it, but it is true to some extent.   As the last draw was being done, my phone rang.&nbsp; It was Dig and I asked to have him call back.&nbsp; He replied that I could just call him back when I was done.  I thought this not the norm, but I called him on my way out of the lab anyway.&nbsp;   He talked, he explained and as he did, he packed a bag.&nbsp; I won't go into detail, just that he is here with me now.  I have two bags on the floor of my bedroom, we snuggled on the couch and watched a movie and later we will sleep beside each other and dream beautiful dreams.   As for tomorrow, who knows what that will bring.&nbsp; Who knows in any kind of relationship, that is the way life is.&nbsp; You just can't predict it.   And I will say again what I told him earlier today.&nbsp; Do what you have to do,&nbsp;for yourself.&nbsp; Because it's you who has to live through&nbsp;it.

      I have come to the realization that if I ever did stray from Dig it would not be because of a man.   You see, Dig and I are now members of the exclusive "Alternative Lifestyles" New Orleans Club, "Collette's".&nbsp; Since joining, we have partaken in the taboo twice.   Our first night there, I think I was more nervous than he was.&nbsp; We sat at the bar for quite some time, sipping sodas and people watching.&nbsp; We eventually ventured upstairs and checked out the rooms there.&nbsp; Not sure of the process of how things worked, we stuck together and were only with each other.  The group room was kind of interesting, 4 large mattresses and what started as 4 separate couples, but soon we were blessed with a visual of 2 of the couples helping each other out.&nbsp; That was nice to see.&nbsp;  Dig and I wandered around some more and then before we know it, it was 15 minutes til closing.  We left and as we walked back to the car, we discussed the events of the night.&nbsp; We both came away with the same conclusion.&nbsp; We enjoyed ourselves and would be back.   The very next night we did go back.   Again we were at the bar for awhile, though this time I was tipsy on wine, then made our way upstairs.&nbsp; We ended up in a pair of tall chairs, listening to conversations around the room and were treated by a show for awhile before the girls went to a more private location.&nbsp; That vacant seat was soon occupied by a couple that struck up a conversation with Dig and I.   The 4 of us ended up in..............well, let's leave it at that.   Again, it was soon to be closing time, so as Dig and I walked back to the car we talked alittle about what happened.&nbsp; What it was like and how it made us feel.&nbsp; We both agreed that Dig got cheated, the girl apparently backed out at the last moment to do anything with Dig.&nbsp; The guy, though well endowed, he wasn't Dig.&nbsp; He was just alright.   I know we will go back.&nbsp; Most of the people we have met there, talked to, etc. have been nice.&nbsp; And I have had a fantastic time, as I am sure Dig has also.&nbsp; I just won't be looking for any men.

      I didn't get to have my blood drawn today.&nbsp; I overslept and didn't get to the blood center until 7am and by then there were at least 30 people in front of me.&nbsp; So I figured 2 hours of waiting and then another 2 hours of glucose testing was a little too much for me, especially on an empty stomach.  So, here I am fasting for 12 hours again.&nbsp; I am more hungry tonight than I was last night and the Ice Cream in the freezer has learned my name in at least 10 different languages.&nbsp; Argh!!&nbsp;  I know I will end up in bed early, cuz if I don't, I will drive myself insane.   On another note:  I did get some exciting news today.&nbsp; D called and let me know he golfed under 3 digits today, this is a wonderful thing.&nbsp; Seriously!&nbsp;  Then he asked me about going golfing on Saturday, with a friend of his and his friend's girlfriend.&nbsp; Apparently the girlfriend wants to learn, as I do too, so of course I said yes.&nbsp;  Now I am all excited about learning how to golf.&nbsp; This is so great{does the happy dance}!  Ohh, I am gonna have to remember to ask my dad to borrow his clubs.  Then I have to find something comfortable to wear.  Ohh, I might have to go shopping.....  So much to do, so little time!

      Ok, I am coming clean.  What has been bugging me.  About 6 weeks ago, I went to the Doctor.&nbsp; I have been having numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, hands and feet for some time now.&nbsp; Since my car accident the numbness has been more frequent.&nbsp; So I asked my Doctor what it could be.  His first response was a possible diagnosis of M.S.&nbsp; The idea blew my mind.&nbsp; I have dealt, very well I think, with the possibility since today.&nbsp;  I have been through the recommended tests.  I had an MRI, both contrast and a regular.&nbsp; The contrast was a little on the rough side, but I endured.  Today,&nbsp;during the needle and shock test, I was told that I do not have M.S.&nbsp; This is a major relief.&nbsp;  The shock test went well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did cry.&nbsp; It hurt like hell.&nbsp; I really hate needles. (Unless a Tattoo is the reward)&nbsp; D was there for support and I Love him for it.&nbsp;  He has been a real solid support during this, keeping my brain focused on other things and being the front headline of entertainment (Heheee).  The Doc was pleased, to a point, with the test results.&nbsp; He&nbsp;said that the arms were good, but the legs were not quite what they should be.  So result.....Tomorrow I get to have another needle.&nbsp; I am having blood drawn.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Friday, when I arrived at the hotel, I took Beau out on his leash, walked up to the hotel to check in and I was greeted by a man.&nbsp; He looked down and said, "You aren't staying here are you?"&nbsp; I said, "As a matter of fact I am."&nbsp; I walked past him and to the check in counter.&nbsp; As I approached I was greeted with stares and the girl behind the counter said, "You aren't staying here with that dog, he is over 25 pounds."  Beau weighs maybe 45 pounds, stands to my knee on all four paws and would lick you to death before he would hurt you.  Now, I had just been in a car with a dog for an hour and a half, had to make a pee stop too, so I was getting a little peeved.&nbsp; I told the girl that the weight issue was not stated at the time of reservation and I was staying.&nbsp; The man that first greeted me&nbsp;became a little angered and said, "Not in his hotel!"&nbsp; Finally I said fine, I will just go home.&nbsp; This was a mistake to begin with.  I went outside and called D.&nbsp; I told him they wouldn't let me stay at the hotel, blah, blah, blah....and I was going home.  Boy, did he get mad.&nbsp;  After a few unfriendly words, ending with, "You do what you have to do and call me back."&nbsp; I went back in the hotel to cancel my reservation.&nbsp; The girl got a confused look on her face and said I didn't have one under my name.&nbsp; I told her to look again and to also check for Digger.&nbsp; At that time I looked down at a table that was near the counter.&nbsp; On the table was a flyer.&nbsp; On the flyer was the address for the hotel I was standing in.  I turned pink with embarrassment.&nbsp; I was at the wrong hotel.&nbsp;  After we had a good laugh, they gave me directions to the right place and I left.&nbsp;  When I checked into the correct hotel, I left Beau in the car.  &nbsp;  Now for the hotel.....  As I drove up to the hotel, it occurred to me why I missed it.&nbsp; This "Palace" that we would be staying at for the next two nights was located behind a vacant looking building and a used car dealership.&nbsp; The front lot had broken down vehicles in it and one of the signs on the front was missing.  I drove around the back of the vacant building and left Beau in the car as I went in to check in.&nbsp; The lobby was a sparse room, with chipped tile in the front doorway.&nbsp; Computer printer paper signs were everywhere.&nbsp; You know the kind I mean...word format documents with 72 font words in black.&nbsp; It was alright though, it looked like they were under new management and were trying to clean the place up.&nbsp; The floor was clean and you could see spots that new plaster had been applied to the walls.  Keycard in hand I went back to my car and drove around the back of the building.&nbsp; Ohhh, bad mistake.&nbsp; I counted 7 cars that had no wheels, really the entire wheel was gone, 1 had windows busted out and several that didn't look like they had been drivin in quite some time.  I finally found my room, fabulous!, overlooking the pool.  I took Beau up first.&nbsp; I wanted to get him out of site, just in case it turned out to be a problem to have him there.&nbsp; As I opened the door I told myself to have an openmind.&nbsp; My first impression was it smelled clean.&nbsp; Then I looked around and it looked clean.&nbsp; I turned on all the lights and inspected closer.&nbsp; King bed, clean(appeared) sheets, could see vacuum marks on carpet, several towels(older, but clean), new soap, new TP, fridge, microwave, TV....ok, I have been in worse.&nbsp; I must commend them, I didn't see any evidence of roaches and there were no mouse traps to be found.  After getting all the gear in and feeding Beau I stepped out to the landing.&nbsp; I watched a couple kids splash around in the pool for awhile and started to go back to my room.&nbsp;  I will say, if you want to stay cheaply in BR and you don't care what kind of atmosphere you have, then I recommend the place.&nbsp; But if you can't tolerate, pimps, their workers, drug addicts and homeless, don't stay there.&nbsp;  As I walked back to my room, I got a warm whistle from a nice gentleman all dressed in nastyness, the evil eye from the cute girl who was wearing a flowing yellow cotton mini with matching 3 inch sandals that laced up her leg and a "you new here?" from the nice lady on her way to the laundry facility with 3 youngin's in tow.  Don't get me wrong, I really did have a good time.&nbsp; I wouldn't care if I was camping in the woods, as long as D was there.&nbsp; Spending some time with him was&nbsp;80% of the purpose for this trip.  The other 20% was to see the boys play ball.  And they played, two game elimination and they played two games.&nbsp; That is all I will say about that!  &nbsp;  Now I am home, okay, really I am at my sister's.&nbsp; Beau is feeling glad to be home, but I am sure he will miss sleeping with me.&nbsp; It was very warm with both him and D in bed with me.&nbsp; I was wedged between them most of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And ya know something, I wouldn't trade this past weekend for anything.&nbsp; I really had a good time.&nbsp;

       I stopped by Chevy's last night.&nbsp; 2 for 1 and they had a new crew there for Karaoke.  &nbsp;  New crew alright, last night was there first night to even use their new equipment.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  They had a few bumps, but they did alright.&nbsp; Also, since the usual crowd had been told no more karaoke would happen, there wasn't many people there.&nbsp; I will say, I put on a mini concert and the people that were there were cool with it.&nbsp; I took it as practice time and even tried out a few new songs.&nbsp; Anyway, I had a great time.&nbsp; The new crew&nbsp;was awesome.&nbsp; Trav and Kim&nbsp;are sweetie's and I think we may become friends.&nbsp; (I am serious)  Ohhh, and before I forget, "Happy Birthday Trav!!"   &nbsp;  Ok, now I am off.&nbsp; I need to load up the car and get gas.&nbsp; The sooner I get my butt in gear, the sooner I will be at the hotel and the sooner I can get ready to see my Sexy Man.  &nbsp;  Ya'll have a great weekend and don't do anything I wouldn't!!&nbsp; Heheeeee!  &nbsp;

      Ahhh, got my diet Dr. Pepper, a roast in the oven, my shorts on(cuz it's so friggin hot), my shit all piled on my bed to pack...ahhh the life.  Yeah, it's been kind of sucky lately.  I saw Dig twice yesterday.  First time, since Saturday night,  was real quick to pick up the boys shirts for this weekend and the second time was at the game.  He is so cute when he walks by and gives me that coy smile.  I notice a lightening of his step when he sees me in the bleachers.  I really like that and I am already so used to it, that I look for it and it makes me smile.  After the game we met up for a drink, but it was only for a few minutes.  The end of baseball is tough.  Getting ready for State is tougher.  But I think I have held up pretty well.  I haven't whined too much. Though I miss him terribly.  I am busy packing a few things tonight.  My sister, bro-in-law, nephew, mom and my niece are heading out to Florida tonight.  Sis asked me to watch her animals, so I invited myself to stay at her house.  She has a dog, a little more than a few cats, birds, fish and a guinea Pig.  I figured it would be easier to stay there and stop by my place to check on my girls(cats) than do the opposite.  Plus, she has a pool and a hot tub and I packed my suit. I am hoping she put some snacks up and a few diet Pepsi's in the fridge.   Then Friday, me and the dog are heading to BR...for a little Baseball.  I am so excited about it, I have never been to a State Championship before.  It's gonna be great!

      I ended up at the pub last night.  It had been a few weeks since being there and the girls missed me.  There is a new bartender, she seems really sweet and she is a lot cute.  The night went the usual.  T showed up and was accosted by a man that could have passed for 80 years old, then J walked in and as she stood there talking to me, the old fart started walking towards her.  I watched him over her shoulder.  He took a step, made a disgusting face, took a step, did that face again, made a noise, took a step....when he looked like he was gonna drool on her shoulder I put up my hand.  He stared at my hand, shook his head and moved back to his seat.  I think J was relieved, I know I was.  I wasn't in the mood to beat his ass.  D surprised me by showing up.  That was a wonderful surprise.  And he smelled so good.  I wanted to take him home right then and eat him up.....but I didn't and he left around 12:30.  Before I knew it, Karaoke was shut down for the night and I sat with JT and Amber for awhile talking to them.  JT was his usual, manly self.  I noticed he didn't really pay her a lot of attention, but I also noticed she didn't pay him any either.  JT eventually wandered off and Amber and I started a very deep conversation.  We talked about serious stuff and funny stuff.  Her past, mine, similarities and differences.    Then she mentioned sexuality.... I kept quiet and let her talk and I was glad I did.  She has no idea that I lust for her, thank goodness.  She has some very strong beliefs.  And she is very, very straight. I inwardly was disappointed, but hey, not all your fantasies can come true. There won't be any waiting patiently for her B/F to mess up, so I can be her comfort.  {Sigh} Ohhh well, I can still dream about it...

      I called the car dealer.  I told the service manager that I was having a problem with my car again.  He said bring it in.  I told him that would be fine, but I wasn't going to wait around.  I needed a car or a ride.  He told me the shuttle left at 8:30am.  To which I told him that would not be good enough.  I told him I pay an additional 10 bucks a month for a service policy.  He said, Oh well that will give me a rental, after the diagnosis.    I told him the car had been in twice for the same problem.  He said, Oh well it could be a different problem.  Now I get no free rental because I need a new diagnosis.  WTF am I paying 10 bucks a month for?

      Ya know, I am so sick of car dealers and repair shops.  1st, I found out for sure that I was taken advantage of for lots of money in repairs to my Beetle.  Now D's Beetle.  For a mere $150 bucks he now has her purring like a kitten.  2nd, my one year old Dodge Neon has been in the shop twice for the engine light being on.  First time they found that there was a leak in the exhaust somewhere, but couldn't find it.  The second trip they told me it was a purged cylinoid (I know I misspelled it) and they replaced it.   Damn engine light is back on, it came on this afternoon.   Tomorrow I am calling the dealer back, they are taking my car in, giving me a free rental and fixing my car.  Damn it!

Life has just delivered me a smorgasboard...ok, not just, like today...just as in the last month.  And I can't talk about it right now.  Right now it's nothing, just a few could be's and maybe's.   I will have more news after the 19th.  So hang on. Bare with the mood swings. Tolerate the sporadic posting.  I am sure I will find some trouble in the next few days to entertain even myself.

      Yesterday was my one year anniversary to Blogging.  Happy Anniversary to me!  A lot has evolved in my life since then.  I have gone thru several relations, made many mistakes but all in all, I have come thru it a better person. I still have my bouts of self-pity and my doubts as to whether I am doing it the right way for me, but that is part of life.  Sometimes I want to just throw my hands up and say WTF.  I am in a low spot right now.  And I wonder how long it will last.  I have friends that have spoken out that they are just giving up.  They claim to have tried and nothing has worked, so they are sitting in their hell of a life and letting it take over. I don't want to do that. I am going to be 40 this year, in 5 months.  I wonder what is out there for me.  I am not like my friends, I am older and I have been through more bumps.    Someone very close to me became upset with me the other day.  She yelled at me that I have someone and she has nothing.   She is wrong about that.  She has everything.  She is 27, single, beautiful, smart, has a college degree, lives in her own place and can do whatever her heart desires.  She chooses to be alone.  She may argue that, but it is true.  The ones she goes out with, has a limited relationship with or does anything with are incapable of committing to her fully.  They are bad boys.  Those are her choices and so she is alone.  My choice is companionship.  Someone that is compatible with me in every way.  Someone I don't have to change for.  Someone that does not expect me to be anything but me.  That is why I am not alone, most times.    I know she was a little jealous of what I have.  I don't think she really thought it out before she spoke.  She does really know the sacrifices that I had to make within myself to have what I have.  Anyway...Blah...starting to depress myself even more.  I am gonna just stop right there...I feel like I am repeating myself too.  Sooooo, Happy Anniversary to me and Happy 4th of July, independence Day, to us all!!

       Posted Via Email:   Saturday I went to the Pub.  Yeah, go figure....seriously, it had been 3 weeks and they missed me. Anyway, I get there and I am on my way to being toast.  I am sitting at the bar, waiting for my name to be called and Louie sits next to me.  Louie is a cute, young, taller version of Mr. Atlanta.  Louie is all of 27, married, has a 2 year old daughter, works his ass off and is lonely.  His wife was sitting on the other side of the room, yacking her head off to who ever about what ever. Before I realized where the conversation was heading he turned to me and said, "You do know I am very attracted to you and you tempt me every time I see you".  I wasn't surprised. Louie and I met about a year ago and there was a sizzle then, but I behaved and left him alone. We sat there and talked for a couple hours, pausing long enough to go up and sing and for me to share conversation with Jenn.  He confessed that he is miserable and only stays where he is because of his little girl.  I listened and then told him what I tell all the miserably married men in my life.  "Baby, you got to do what makes you happy, cuz bottom line that is all that matters."  He ended up getting a call from the babysitter and he left.  His wife stayed and drank and socialized with her friends.  I didn't stay much longer than that.  I was severely over-served.  On my way home I called Dig.  The alcohol, the witnessing of the way Louie's wife treated him, the listening to Dig talk about his, my being alone at the time and afraid that Dig and his would make amends and he would leave me all came to a head and I lost all emotional control. I blubbered like a baby, then cried myself to sleep.
