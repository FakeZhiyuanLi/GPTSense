         I made this for Arlene's birthday. It was hard for my first foray with wire bending. For this project I used a thingamajig called a, well, jig. It's basically a plate with holes, then you stick different diameter pegs in it and wrap your wire around the pegs.  I haven't made a new design yet after Arlene's. Kinalyo kasi ako.  I'll post pics of the jig soon. You can improvise your own with a wooden board and different diameters of nails.    In detail  Other materials used:  Stainless steel wire from Quiapo Glass beads from Quiapo and Tutuban

      I got this idea from the wonderful site that is  urlLink  Craftster.org ! Basically, you take a hardbound book, take out the pages, replace it with lining that you either sew or glue. Then glue everything to the book cover, add clasps or whatnot, then boom! Instant clutch bag. The link to the online tutorial isn't working anymore, but next time I find it, I'll post it here.     For my variation, I used black elastic, and an old button. I glued them inside the lining for clasps. Reader's Digest condensed books cost only Php50.00 or less at a used books store, and the old ones from the 60s to the early 80s have covers with nice patterns. For my lining, I used leftover scraps of cloth which date back to my childhood. I think my mom used this cloth for pillow cases. :) I glued a length of ribbon on the cover para feminine konti. :)    Inside    Yes, i did use a book!

      DIY doesn't have to be too perfect. I have to admit, that's my philosophy simply because I never know exactly how my projects will come out, baka may pumalpak... but who knows? Baka ok lang yung result diba?   Here's an old project just to show a simple example of how to pick up the things lying around the house (well, kind of)and giving them other jobs to do.  When my 2nd brother left for Singapore, he and my sis-in-law closed down their home-decor store. They left some carpet samples apparently, I just took two pieces (they had cloth binding on the edges), pierced some holes, used ribbon (with color similar to the cloth edging) and just wove the ribbon in. Ptoink, instant welcome mat for my room!

      This necklace is easy to do,as in NO DUH.  You'll need: 1)Ribbon clasps- Well, i'm not sure what it's called really. But it has a U shaped metal part attached to a ring. The idea is to crimp the ribbon inside the U.  2)Organze ribbon- a length that'll fit your neck, choker-style. Should be compressible enough to fit into the bead hole. I used a half-inch width ribbon.  3)Clasps- your choice. You can use lobster claps, or similar. The one used here is a ring-and-T version.  4)Jump rings- to attach clasp to the ribbon-thing clasps. It has two ends, so you can "open" the ring.  5)Beads of your choice-Used here are glass beads bought in Quiapo.  General directions:  1)Cut end of ribbon into a slant... forming a sort of improvised needle with the side seam of the ribbon. Use this end to thread the bead into the ribbon. If you have a fabric stiffener, that would be peachy, as it helps to minimize fraying. I don't have that. hehehe.  2)Thread beads in...you'll notice they keep snug all by themselves and won't move about by themselves.  3)Attach ribbon clasp things at each end of the ribbon. Place ribbon end inside the U and crimp it closed.  4)Attach jump rings to ribbon clasp things. Use a long-nose plier to open the ends and to close it back after you attach them.  5)Attach your clasps.  Done! Instant gratification!     Detail of clasp:

      This is my first attempt on a domino necklace with a wooden domino. Living in Manila, it's hard to find crafts supplies, so&nbsp;I mostly end up drooling over the pictures I see over the net. Originally, I had wanted to make  urlLink these &nbsp;using plastic/ivorine white dominoes. I scoured all the National Bookstore and SM toy center branches, coming up only with black, wooden versions.   Stamping the design was out of the question. I experimented with soaking the black dominoes in bleach, just to see what would happen.&nbsp;The&nbsp;next day,&nbsp;it was still black, and the dominoes just warped out of shape. Thus, I used a fresh domino&nbsp;so I tried decoupaging it.  Steps I did:   First, I drilled a hole in the domino where the jump ring would go.  Then I sanded the domino with a rough grit sand paper to create a slightly distressed texture.  I spray painted it using antique bronze paint lying around in&nbsp; the house.   I googled the net for some nice clip art. I have a certain fascination with vintage Chinese ads, and naturally, I picked a vintage Chinese pin-up girl clip art.

      Can't really do much crafting these days... I'm in study mode! However, I have these things to look forward to:    Learn how to use mom's sewing machine.  Having finished task #1...sew a urlLink  purse/tote bag .  Use my new white plastic dominoes to make nicer domino necklaces. I finally found those elusive tiles in Chinatown.  Make more  urlLink wire and&nbsp;bead necklaces .  Stencil some t-shirts   urlLink Re-size old t-shirts .   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Aha! The plot thickens, as meself has discovered that, well, html just doesn't cut it anymore. I have discovered a new bane that is...CSS! Editing this template is not as "learnable" as I thought. Hmmm... *twiddles imaginary moustache*

      It's been a long, long time since I've tinkered with HTML ( kala mo dating HTML expert )... that is to say, light years ago when I had my own homepage.  It's so comforting to know that things haven't changed, HTML is still as confusing as ever. Did geeks plan it that way to weed out all the interlopers?  Anyhow, I need to break out of this template, soon! This was the template which most appealed to me (and it looks like it, to Arlene too *bumps pwet*). Very retro polka dots! But soon, I'll need to embellish this with other gadgets... nooneenoo.     Troy-troy-troy, troy-troy-troy!   Watched "Troy" last night. For those who haven't watched it... I shall sum it up in three words. Brad Pitt's Butt.  Dad relished in the fact that he knew his Greek mythology well, thank you, thus providing me, my mom, and the two people seated in front of us, with a running commentary, and spoilers!!! I mean, okay... it's not like The Passion of the Christ where  everyone  knows what happens in the end. I honestly don't know squat about the whole Helen of Troy fiasco except for the Trojan horse thing,pero mapapanood ko naman yon sa movie diba???? But dad was happy... he waited 3 weeks to watch this ("Was Brad Pitt the one in Pearl Harbor?")     I can see clearly now...   Ahh... the wonders of modern tech. It has been a week since I had surgery to zap my eyes with "La-zzzer" (*cue Dr. Evil in Austin Powers 2*). From a 600-700 plus grade... I'm down to 25 and 50 (left and right). The eye doc said they found protein deposits in my right eye, which are *tears*, incurable daw! Thus, my right will always be not as sharp as my left.   However, I'm not complaining much. At last, I can finally ditch my contacts !(take that!) And those stupid bottles of solution and lubricant! (hah!) And my ultra-thin glasses... which looked thick pa rin despite of the pricy Nikon lens. It was worth it!

      Hmm..this title doesn't sound good for my first post in my revived blog. I've had this blog since 2001 but somehow I lost interest. Seeing the nice revamped format of blogspot (ooh! All those endless possibilities!), and looking at Jeff's and Arlene's blogs...I thought... what the hey!  First things first... trying to remember my old user name and password! Aack! Que horror! Finally I kind of remembered what it was, and I got to delete my old postings... which aren't that relevant anymore.  So why Warm Blankie? A warm blanket is your comfort zone, well, mine that is. A warm blankie for Pooh's blustery day. This is where I can vent, rant, and sing praises for whatever I deem vent-able, rant-able and sing-praisable.   An old friend of mine misses my old zine, Charlene's World... well, maybe I can make this an online version. We'll see.  :)

      Okay, I'm trying not to panic. But how can I not? In our living room there are at LEAST  five  big paperbags full of reviewers and other compilations of notes. That does not count the 5-inch stack of back-to-back Dental Decks (parang review cards) compilation on the sala table, yung pina-photocopy ko (worth Php 800-something), tapos pina-ring bind ko na rin. It also doesn't count the other books and reviewers in my bedroom.  All of those stuff are mainly from well-meaning friends who have already taken the boards. The 1998 version of the Decks are from Sara. She placed Number 3. The 2001 version is from Jerick. Nag-place din siya. Forgot lang kung pang-ilan. Yung iba kay Janice. Top 10 din siya. Yung bulk ng mga notes were from Enggay. Number 7.   If I suddenly go insane, baka ipahid ko na lang yung notes nila sa katawan ko para sakaling madapuan ako ng swerte and talino.  Haynaku. Hinde. I need to start getting organized na.  About 6 or 7 of us from UP are taking the December boards. Me, Jen R., Kath B., Kath S., Joannabee, Emjay, and possibly Pauline. Pressure! Pinaka-konting number of people yata kami. Gotta make 100% all-passing. We'll meet up tomorrow and set up a study plan to meet up at least once a week and study together.  I've started arranging the reviewers na, eliminating the redundant ones. Nilabas ko na rin yung arsenal of highlighters ko and my number 1 pencils. May rumors daw na walang biochem this year. If that happens, uber joy!!! Lecheng Kreb's Cycle yan!  July na bukas.  Boards are in December. Panic!

      Okay. I have a dental appointment at noon with my good friend Bok. Sniff. Because...I have cavities. Because she is a verrrry verrrry good friend, she has promised to cut the ehem, crap, and give me outright a dose of anesthesia.   Last week, I had my teeth cleaned by Bok, of course, after I cleaned  her  teeth muna. Thus the discovery of those pesky cavities. See? Even dentists get cavities. It is very, very disconcerting to be IN the dental chair, instead of being chairside. One feels very vulnerable, cold, helpless. Yes, I'm actually quite afraid of dentists. This is where the "sleepy juice" comes in. I'd rather take a good dose of anes, rather than twisting my stomach into knots wondering if the procedure would hurt.     Doc Bok and I studied in UP using these same methods     Glitter on the church grounds    Saturday and Sunday was the feast of St. Peter. Where there's a feast, there's a ...fiesta. Ang dami kong nakitang Teachers of Christmas Past. Freaky...they are  still  teaching. Ang hardy talaga ng mga katawan nila.  I had a booth with glitter tattooing. Business was okay, nabawi ko naman lahat. Had there been more people nung Saturday, I would've earned a more respectable profit. Mas madaming customers nung Sunday. The kids were really cute. We even had pre-school twins and their sister who kept coming back, till they each had two tattoos. We also had a mom, her bayaw (hmmm), and her two kids who each got tattoos. Big thank yous to Vangie, Arl, Jeff and Kikay. Sobrang helpful ninyo!   Vangie and Arls were my marketing girls. Si Vangie din, very efficient bookkeeper, tallying sales, giving me updates like how much more we needed para bumawi, hahaha. Nakakatawa si Vang, nagpanic siya at one point kasi she thought she painted the PETALS on the rose tattoo GREEN. Pag tingin ko, hindi naman, I said, "Eh mga leaves yan eh." For a moment,na-confuse pala ni Vang kung ano ang leaves at ano ang petals. Kaya ngayon, asar-talo sakin si Vang.    Tug-of-war-meets-pabitin    During Saturday, there was also a Palarong Pambata on the school grounds. There was a surreal incident of the Only In The Philippines variety. During the "pabitin" game, medyo nagkagulo ng konti. The bamboo lattice frame thingie, habang nag-aagawan na yung mga bata for prizes, fell through this kid's head. The frame was literally around his neck. I didn't actually see it happen, but from the kwentuhan alone, total weirdness. Parang Looney Tunes. Kulang na lang may brand na ACME yung frame. Sa sobrang gulo ng pabitin, which is the VERY nature of a pabitin game, the other kids didn't notice that the frame was stuck nga and they still kept tugging for prizes, pulling the kid's neck in different directions. Buti na lang the kid was okay, scratched up lang siguro ng konti. But I'm sure he won't play pabitin again. Ever.

      Last night, decked out in a party outfit, I was looking for some shoes in the shoe rack when my father took a look at me and said: "You're a  metrosexual. " Take note, these are English subtitles. The audio is Hokkien, except for the M-word. (I think I watched one DVD too many). That same moment, my dad was ready to go to a different party,clad in a lilac-colored barong Tagalog and his two year-old, kiwi-polished-without-fail-Florsheims.  I said, "Pa-aaa (with the intonation of a daughter mildly exasperated with her dad), do you know what metrosexual actually means???"  "Doesn't it mean to be modern and well-dressed?" dad went.  So I tried to explain to him what the term was. I have to admit, that term has been pretty much abused within the past year and a half. Botox-ing Albert Martinez is  metrosexual. If Dolphy slathered on face cream he'd be metrosexual too. Or Maurice Arcache.   I just hope dad didn't talk about his "metrosexual" daughter at the party.

      ...when there's Dunkin' Donuts around!  Drinking Dunkin' Donuts coffee has made me realize how the youth has been wasting precious dinero on image-conscious coffee.  Was in Powerplant yesterday, waiting to get picked up. By my mom (you ha, ano iniisip mo). Medyo dizzy ako from my eye-doc appointment...they put eye-drops in my eyes to make my pupils dilate and I was still reeling from the after effects. I had been to the bookstore, to True Value... I just wanted to sit down and have cheap coffee. Out of school youth na kasi ako.  I spy the D.D. near True Value and I order a cuppa. A small cup (equivalent to a Starbuko short) is Php22. A medium cuppa...is worth Php28! And, for an additional TEN PESOS, you get a shot of either hazelnut, French vanilla, Irish creme, or macadamia nut. A medium please. Of course I want a shot, ring it up, my good man.  Ummmm....sarap! Heaven!

      Prior to last Saturday, I invited Vang, Arlene, Jepoy and Jenova to go a-touring with me in Intramuros. The mission: To take 2 Chinese girls from Xiamen University, 20 and 21-years old, around Intramuros for a little tour.  Only Jen ended up going (lakwatsera kasi, hahaha). Buti na lang at least she was able to go kung hindi mahihirapan talaga ako mag-translate ng stuff. The two girls, Cathy and Trellis (yes, she knows the meaning of her English name) are on practicum from Xiamen U, and are two of 80-something teachers assigned to different Tsinoy schools around the Philippines.  After bribing Jen with glitter tattooing, we proceed to Paco Citizen school to pick up the girls. Only Cathy ended up going because it turned out that Trellis overslept from watching soccer till 5 AM that morning.  First stop, San Agustin Church. As usual, may wedding in progress, and another wedding party waiting to go on the next hour. Next stop, Casa Manila, my favorite museum in Intramuros. Must've been there like 4 times already.   Outside amongst the piedra china-lined road was a block of stone like this:    Hmm...curious kami ni Jentot, kasi last 2 weeks ago pa namin nakikita yun sa Baluarte San Diego.    Next, we went to the Manila Cathedral (yet with another wedding). The kocheros outside were offering to take us on a ride... with a substantial P250 fee (oops, tawad na daw to P150). We declined, and proceed to go to the National Museum.  It turns out that the NaMu (naks, parang MoMa sa New York) was closed for repairs (the one with the Spolarium), and we were then directed to the new one, the renovated old Finance Building behind it. I'd have to say the museum is not of the musty, dark museum-variety you have encountered during grade-school field trips. The new NaMu is definitely one where you can bring foreign guests with pride.  Medyo nahilo lang kami ni Jenova sa dami ng jars on display. Especially Chinese jars unearthed from dive sites. Si Cathy rin siguro, nadamihan sa jars. hehehe. Out in the courtyard pala was an actual igorot bahay kubo, saya!    Afterwards, it was lunch time at the Orchidarium just next door. Amidst the gardens nestled the Lush Life resto. We tried the longganisa and kesong puti pizza. I am very much NOT a longganisa fan, but I had to admit this one was kinda okay. The tomato and basil pasta was still as yummy as before, and we washed it all down with dalandan shake.    At 1pm we drove to Bahay Tsinoy back in Intramuros again. I made an earlier arrangement with my friend Ivan, who writes for Tulay, to give us a personal tour. Ivan was a great guide, explaining in Mandarin for Cathy everything interesting to know about Tsinoy history. Ivan, it turns out had the answer to my puzzlement about the Chinese-inscribed piedra china. They were old tombstones pala of Spanish-era Chinese. On the upper left and upper right are Chinese characters indicating what province in China did the deceased come from. Engot ko, but of course!-->I see those characters on tombstones every November 1. The piedra china were so hardy that they were used as road paving, stair steps, etc. Ivan said that the people who laid the stones probably didn't know they were grave markers. So there was a bit of controversy there about the desecration of tombstones, oh well.  Ivan also brought us to the Kaisa museum (not the same as Bahay Tsinoy), and the Kaisa library, showing us this room where all the oldest volumes were kept. There was also this edition of Sun Tzu's Art of War, with painted pictures on cloth-like pages we were forbidden to touch, lest we smudge it with oily fingers.  On the way home, we passed by St Peter, so bumaba na rin kami to show her the old alma mater. We went inside the church and showed Cathy our Virgin Mary statue with the Heart Evangelista eyes.  We weren't able to go Fort Santiago anymore and the Rizal Shrine. We were tired, having been gone out from 9 AM to 4 PM. That's for another trip. That, and the Chinese Cemetery (Ma Mon Luk's mausoleum, anyone?), Corregidor, UST, Paco Park...

        *AXN CHANNEL VOICE-OVER*  "Welcome and infiltrate the world of high-stakes bingo..."    Good idea kaya yon for a new reality show?  Last Sunday, dad and I decided to do some father-daughter bonding... so for our quality time, we went to go to this benefit BINGO event in World Trade Center in Roxas (UP Med was the beneficiary). Last week, dad saw this poster in Manila Doctor's hospital advertising the bingo thingie... Aba, Php100,000 at LEAST ang prize per game? Very interesting. Dad wanted to see how the bingo thing was done, so he could get ideas for a fund raiser.   The poster read: P2 MILLION MUST GO! Aba, nagtataka kami. Dad was channeling his inner MBA at nagcocompute na siya sa brain niya, where did the P2-M come from? How many P1,000 tickets should be sold para bumawi and to cover the prizes, and still get enough profit.  Nagulat ako when we walked towards WTC (at kagad may isang scalper na lumapit para magbenta ng ticket less P50 pesos). The parking lot was more than full and a lot of people were outside. We bought a ticket... which includes: - 8 sheets/pages (1 sheet one game) of bingo cards. With one page=one game. And the sheet was divided into 4 separate bingo cards. -A stub for a sandwich and a can of soda (serious bingo players need all the sustenance they can get). -A stub for free entrance to Casino Filipino  -Free dauber(?). I'm not sure of the spelling. But in bingo parlance, it's the pen-thingie which does the colored dotting thing on the bingo cards. Di na pala uso yung nagpapatong ng butong-pakwan sa mga numbers.  The bingo pala was being held by PAGCOR, kaya naman pala kaya nila mag-mount ng bingo of this size!    So dad and I entered tapos WHOOOOOOOOOOSH! Parang blast of dizzy. Nothing in my life had prepared me for this moment. The whole WTC exhibit hall was full of people. Hundreds of tables... Amidst the tables were high chairs like they use to referee tennis matches, with somebody assigned to spot the people shouting Bingo! A stage in the middle with a large screen and a big streamer saying "IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SHOUT BINGO"... and Pepe Pimentel. (But of course, who else).   Dad left me by myself for awhile as I inserted my self into this group of friendly-looking people. Mukhang family sila. The dad was on my left and the mom on my right. Tinuruan nila ako kasi di ko maintindihan yung mga patterns for each game. Crazy T, 4-Leaf Clover, 2 Floating Stamps, 3- Layer Cake. Aba, may mga tawag talaga dun sa mga patterns.Ang tagal tagal ko nang hindi naglalaro ng bingo. I bet standard na 'to sa mga mall bingos!   Whenever someone would shout BINGO, the tennis-referee-like guys would blow their whistles and a fire-alarm bell would ring. Collective groaning all around, and guffaws shempre pag false alarm pala yon, bwahahahahah! Printed on the bingo card sheets pala are numbers. So the referee-guys would just relay the numbers to the stage guys, and lalabas yung game card sa screen. Verified kagad if nabuo talaga yung pattern or not. Sobrang hi-tech na pala ang bingo ngayon.  Later on dumating si Benj to help me hehehe. Benj it turns out, is a Bingo Virgin. He has a vague idea of how a game works, and has never ever played it before. I let him do the dotting-thingie on one game para ma-"empower" siya. Hehehe.  His interesting questions: 1)Bakit hindi naka-arrange in increasing numbers, for example, all the letters under B in a card?-->Nasagot din naman ni Benj kagad to by himself.  2)Kung nasa database naman yung itsura ng winning card, why don't they just announce na may nanalo na? -->Answers: a)May mga absent-minded na hindi nila alam na bingo na sila, so more chances of winning! b)If they did that,eh di parang raffle na yun. Mas may thrill sumigaw ng bingo! c)Mas may laugh trip pag may mga false alarm.  Speaking of false alarms, may isang nag bad bingo, and then you could see on the screen na hindi talaga mukhang arrow pattern yung nasa bingo card niya. I heard someone exclaim  "Ang layo naman non!"   The prize for the last game was P1-million pesos. Nung innanounce na ni Pepe that it was the last chance to win P1-M, the WTC crowd erupted in a roar of table-thumping. Ang galeng! Parang partly yung dinner scene ng mga orphans sa "Oliver!", and partly an amalgamation of all those battle movies na kailangan ng war cry. Exciting! (Natatawa lang ata si Benj)  In the end, we didn't win anything, hehehe. Pero it was a unique experience nonetheless. :)

      Had lunch today with Bokyang, Dennis, Steph and Sara at Bento Box in Makati. We walked Sara home to her condo. When we left the condo... aba! There was a discarded condom on the ground sa street! Ngee! It was beige and I thought at first baka great big pile(?) of snot yun! Hindi pala! I didn't dare take a look if it was used or not. We had theories about the thing... maybe it was flung off from one of the many condo(m) units in Salcedo, in a fit of passion. And the guy was probably the old-fashioned type, kasi daw beige yun and had no design. Oh well. *cringe*  Later, we tried to go to San Juan because we were supposed to take a look at this space in Wilson street, to be turned into a possible dental clinic. Grabe yung traffic sa EDSA. The traffic was slow enough we were able to take a picture of this wonderful piece graffiti:    Bawal omehe deto rules!!!

      Hmm...or my face even! The proof is in the pudding!    See where her right hand goes and what her left one is signalling. If that's not a thumbs-down. I don't know what that is.  These bangs take getting used to. It's hard to style. Some say I look younger with it (eh?). The real hard thing though, is waking up in the morning with a mullet 'do, parang redneck na trucker...kulang na lang magpapa-gas. Mwehehe. Oh well, it'll grow out!    Dinner at La Copa    Last Sunday we had a Father's Day dinner at this resto near the old Manila Domestic Airport. Now I don't know kung nagdinner kami that night kasi nagkamali yung kuya ko at akala niya Father's Day yung Sunday na yun...or it's because that was the date when everyone was free. Anyhoo, dinner was with my sister-in-law's (Michelle) family.  La Copa is like a cheaper version of Casa Armas..with steak. The Caesar (Ceasar? Cezar Asar?) salad was yummy, and in wooden bowls the way the salad should be. The calories went straight to my thighs nanaman. I got the pepper steak, which came in a substantial size for Php225. Other steaks were similarly prized at Php200-300. Other dishes we ordered were paella valenciana and baked white oysters.   I think I'd recommend the place, if you're looking for a relatively cheaper date place and willing to go as far. As ambiance goes... the place is dark and candlelit. If your contact lenses ever get dislodged from your eyes, then it's bye-bye.  Maxine is 6 months old na!    If I were a harpist...

      I had a haircut. As in impromptu haircut. Unpre-meditated. No appointment. I decided this morning to have a haircut and in 30 minutes I was off to Makati.   Sabi ni Elsa the hairstylist: "Anong gagawin natin sa buhok mo? (while lifting my limp locks) Ang kapal, ang straight pa." "Ahh... ikaw na bahala... basta may personality. Parang si Meg Ryan." (I didn't have my AM coffee yet, I didn't know what I was saying)  Thirty minutes later, I don't look like Meg Ryan. The cut is okay... but I now have 16-year-old-person bangs!!! (with the body of a pear-shaped 26-year old). I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing :P

      Ok, kelangan ko na mag-aral seriously pretty soon. Ngee. I'm getting a bit of the heebeejeebies thinking about my board exams in December! Just this morning, I saw this tiny 2 inch X 1 ad in the paper advertising this memory enhancement class. So may picture ng babae, a doctor, tapos may short testimonial which went something like "I passed the medical boards on the 3rd try! Thanks to Power Memory!!!" On the 3rd try???? OMG. Wag naman po sana!!!  Incidentally, I once called up Power Memory to inquire about their program. The method sounded pretty hokey. A method I tried before and I knew na hindi hiyang sa akin, so I told them, no thank you. From then on, once every two months, tumatawag pa din yung guy nila, asking if interested ako. Eh sabi ko na nga dati hindi eh!!  Di ba nila maalala???     6 Months and 10 days    -What's that?: Estimated life span of--J. Lo and Marc Anthony's Wedding (Alma and Rudy must be so proud! *KABLAG!!!*    Barbie vs Da Bratz    Looks like Mattel has been way upstaged by the company the makes the Bratz line of dolls. I think I'm getting old. I can't relate to the Bratz dolls. I look at them in the toy store and I see Christina Aguillera, yung medyo mukhang big-eyed "ho", with the skimpy outfits and all.  According to the business paper, Mattel plans to create more Barbie versions for their Worlds of Barbie scheme, so they're gonna introduce stuff like Barbie "Prince and the Pauper" and other themes. I have to admit, the Bratz are more edgier, which is more ehem, happening, with the kids today. But no one, but Barbie can be a pilot, stewardess, president, Cleopatra, ballerina, rock star, etc.   I used to think Barbie was politically incorrect (with the blond hair and 17 or so-inch-equivalent waistline)... but I'm waxing nostalgic, so I forgive her.    Still my favorite words of the moment    Sprikitik Heebeejeebies Nekkid

      Got this from yesterday's Philippine Daily Inquirer. In a nutshell, the story is about a 12-foot snake found slithering on a tree branch in San Fro Del Monte, QC, terrifying villagers! (naks, I added the last one, for drama). I quote:   "Snake handler Policarpio Nadado of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau responded to the call for help, and grappled with the python for at least an hour with a pair of  thongs ."   Now  that's  kinky!    You're a tiger baby, yeah!   Spent the better part of yesterday morning being Jenova's subject for her photography assignment. She said she needs me to  win  a contest in the portrait category. Hmmm. I think I have only one good side, and that is, like a one degree point in a 180 degree range. Now Jen...has NO BAD SIDES. I think if she wanted to win, she can train her cam on her then shoot!  Anyhoo, we spent the session traipsing (naks, how does one actually traipse?) around Intramuros and the Orchidarium. She took my picture while I was holding up a piece of styrofoam board below my face to reflect the light (and reflect eyebags?). Pag naging sikat na (butt)model na ako, may assistant na gagawa niyan for me!    Harry Potpot   The latest Harry movie should be retitled "Hermione Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban". Okay, so Harry has his  "Expecto...Patronuuuummmmuhhhhhhhh!!!!"  (with matching post-pubescent voice delivery), I'll give him that, but it's Hermione who figures everything out! Not to mention, she's the better wizard in terms of casting spells.    Only in the Philippines   More on watching movies. Movie watching in the Philippines is a totally unique experience. Buti na lang it's relatively cheap to watch a movie here. Pinoy audiences are not the silent type. If they feel that Tobey Macguire needs help, well,  "Ilag Peter!!! Andyan na ang kalaban!!!"   Okay, the last one was a generalizing statement, but I just wanted to share a moment while watching Harry III at SM Manila with Bentot. At one scene where Hermione, frightened from the hippogriff named Buckbeak, grabs Ron's hand, most of the audience collectively went "Uyyyyyyyyy!!!!" Kulang na lang duktungan ng "May gusto!!!!" Bwahahaha.    Let's Culture-fy ourselves!   Benj and I will watch Ninna's ballet recital in CCP tonight. It'll be my first time to watch ballet, siguro si Benj din. Sana di kami antukin! Jejejeje! (My laugh, Spanish version).

      I just remembered something about a scene I saw last week while going home from PCA when I took my nephews swimming.  I passed by my old school...St Peter the Apostle, and through the gates I saw large machines, like a bulldozer and the one with the large panghakot. But what I didn't see was the old chapel. It was demolished na, because of the newly-constructed other church in the same compound.  That was the chapel where I was baptized, where my aunt got married, where I sang in a choir innumerable times, where I celebrated many Christmas masses.   I had my sixth grade graduation practice there, but never got to attend the actual event because I got chicken pox. This was where I felt sadness during a funeral mass for my choir teacher and dear friend, and where I felt really really happy during masses attended with friends.  I will always remember the tile on the floor with those retro asterisks. The way the sun would pass through the stained glass windows and color everybody a greenish-yellow hue. The way the air felt because it had no air-conditioning. The art deco-ish altar. The "I am the way, the Truth and the Life" in front, with the unaligned "I". My church was stark and simple, as life was then.

      Since Saturday night (mind you, that was 3 nights ago), I have been so  aliw  with my right arm. Why this love affair with my arm? Well you see, that night was the despedida party for my dear friend Ninna. We were supposed to play Cranium or Taboo after dessert, but Anami whipped out the tools of her successful sideline, the GLITTER TATTOO, and the board games were completely ignored.  Anami wanted to teach me to do the tattoos, just in case she needed some artists for an event she would be doing. Here's the one she made on my arm:   .  Very Lisa Frank, eh?  From there, all glitter broke loose as some of us tried our hand at doing tattoos. Pretty soon, everyone had a glittery image on his/her shoulder or ankle.  My butterfly and I will be companions for 8-10 days. She won't wash off in the shower and will go only after the 8-10 day lifespan or if I snuff her life out with baby oil. Glitter Tattoos are a hit at children's parties and other events...more affordable than hiring a face painter! If you wanna, then  email moi !     LINKING is not a walk in the PARK   Okay, that was a lame subheading. Bwahahaha. I've tried reading through Arlene's htmlgoodies.com referral.... Sounds greek! The sites are kind of funny in the sense that the authors make it sound that it's actually very very easy and why can't you people just get it? hehehe. But I do have to thank Arls, because the tutorial there is probably easier than the other ones I've tried to read!

      Typing this using one hand... left hand holds aloft a stick of buko ice drop.  Had anxiety attack #2 again. Agonizing whether to enroll in a certain review center for the theoretical part of the exam. Why do I want to enroll considering I have almost all the needed review materials? Security blanket? Para may structure yung pag-aaral ko? On the other hand, if I enroll there, it will take up my weekends, so everyday ako pagod. Then pag October na, magiging daily na yung sched ng review center. Baka nakakaharass din.  I already enrolled for the practicals part of the board exams. Monday to Friday, the whole day, for one month mid-August to mid-September. After that it's&nbsp; 3 months or less to go and study&nbsp;till the boards. 3 months. Panicky. Panicky.  I need a warm blankie.  &nbsp;

       yahooooooo!   No more cavities!   &nbsp;  Yesterday was my last appointment with Doc Bok... just in time, because before I drove over to her house, I was walking down the street to get the car when I realized my mouth felt a little bit more spacious. Kinakapa ko yung tooth ko   with my tongue when I realized that I must've swallowed my temporary filling. Pag higop (?) ko ng hangin...Wahhhh! Nangingilo na! I must've have flicked the tempo away when I was flossing.  &nbsp;  Anyhow, that afternoon, my inlay was cemented in. As opposed to a regular filling done in the clinic, an inlay has to be fabricated in a dental lab. Medyo masakit sa bulsa, since I have no income at the present. Buti na lang merong dentist's discount, sigh.  &nbsp;  After the appointment, Bok and I went to Cafe Cio for cheap coffee. I am always on the lookout for cheaper alternatives to Starbuko and I highly recommend this place... for now.  &nbsp;  Cafe Cio is located on Jupiter street near the entrance to Bel Air 2, malapit sa Aristocrat. For now, they have this promo wherein every food item you purchase comes with a free cafe Americano. For an additional Php 20, you can upgrade your Americano to a latte, flat white, Vienna or cappu. Not a bad deal. Cafe Cio is a Dencio's company, and their food menu only has Pinoy merienda food like ensaymada, bibingka, sansrival, chicken empanada, and suman sa latik. Thus, you can get a big ensaymada with a short cafe mocha for just Php 50. The cafe mocha's pretty tasty...very frothy on top. Good thing 'cause I don't like the whipped cream version much, like in Starbucks.&nbsp; The place is frequented by a mix of some students (Mapua Makati?) and businessmen in the afternoons.&nbsp; At night, well, hindi ko alam. :)&nbsp; The place looks pretty nice, you walk up through a kind-of-driveway into a garden, and there is also an air-conditioned area with couches, etc&nbsp;where the drinks are ordered.  &nbsp;  Gotta hit the books! Then off to SM later to pick up my repaired, 6 month old Nokia in Semicon.

      It's Benj's birthday today...loolalalooo! I thought I'd surprise him with spaghetti bolognese! Aba, marvelous feat yata yon! To the uninformed friend reading this...it shall now be known that I am not the best cook in the world. I do not even come close to being an average cook! Thus, with the help of 3 friends, I attempted once more to try to force something down my man's stomach. Oops, I meant, to try and get to my man's heart  through  his stomach.  Accomplices: 1)Doc Bokyang: Area of expertise: baking and Italian food. She is Bokyang of the pasta aligue. Before Benj, it was Bok who made me fat with choco chip cookies.  2)Dennis: Specialty: Adobo and leche flan. Has a bit higher cholesterol count.  3)Doc Steph: Dennis' girlfriend. Can outcook and outbake both Dennis and Bok.  After 4 or 5 cellphone calls all in all, I finally jot down the ingredients and directions for some kind of bolognese with a smidgen of pesto. I didn't even know that the two could be combined.  I tried to prepare some of the other stuff last night so I could cook them faster come Sunday. I had this fantasy in my head that I could cook like they do on TV, but it was PRE-CABLE TV, with David Benoit or other light jazz playing the background, and all the ingredients were in these little individual containers...and chef moi introducing the ingredients while tilting the containers to the camera...   *Fantasy bubble popping* So I chopped the garlic, sliced the tomatoes, ground the peppercorn... and made meatballs. Bok said I could pre-cook the meatballs, so I tried just that..."tried" being the operative word. Disastro! Sayang lang yung pag-roll ko ng uniform meat ball shapes, because the periphery of the meatball meat just stuck to the pan. Some of the meat"balls" crumbled into their original ground meat state. And the oil spattering! The reason why I don't like frying anything is the possible spattering. I have this phobia wherein a single tiny spatter of oil could land on my cornea. Wahhhhh!  At the end of the pre-cooking session, I had a small amount of un-respectable looking meat"balls". From the original half-kilo of ground beef, I think 1/8th of that just gotstuck to the pan. My legs were aching afterward and I wanted to lay in bed.  Sunday morning...I felt this not-so-good feeling I needed a back-up plan. Pasta and pesto...from a jar. Cheater!!! I added more garlic, some pine nuts, and some blanched almond slices, para more texture and a bit of ehem, flair. After cooking, I went to our hardware store and did my usual Sunday help-out. Thank God for the back up plan because Benj came by earlier, then I had to go and supervise the electrician fixing our cable TV and it was already past noon. I thought, if I were going to defrost my meat"balls" and do the whole bolognese shebang...anong oras na yon???  So in the end, Benj ended up eating pesto. Then he tells me after that it was okay naman, but he likes tomato-based sauce more than white sauce or olive-oil based sauce. And he doesn't like almonds pala. Aysus!!! *slaps forehead*  Happy birthday hunny!! Mwahahah! :)

      ...and that is a third molar.  I had my one and only third molar extracted last Wednesday. It wasn't painful, getting it done. It's the 'after' that hurts. When the anesthesia has worn off and there is nothing to numb myself from the painful emptiness... of an empty socket.  Naks. Waxing poetic over a tooth.  I've been having a lot of dental work done these past few days. All those pesky cavities that need to be filled, or old fillings that need to be replaced. Hayyy.   Sigh...3 days after the extraction. Wahhh.... masakit pa rin!  Funny...I've forgotten what it felt like to have a bad tooth taken out... the feeling of numbness. How the chin feels so thick and padded, like being Jay Leno! I was kidding Doc Bok to hit me on the chin. Parang fight club. Kasi tutal, manhid naman eh. It was hard to eat lunch while the anes hadn't yet worn off. It felt like I was going to choke on the otherwise tasty pasta aligue.      Hello, Mensa?    Benj sent me a link to this online IQ test. It was amusing because it was the same test given to him when he applied for a job. Apparently, even some companies filch exams off the net hehehe.  I tried to answer the exam in 5 minutes, guessing all the math parts:   Your IQ score is 120   Your Intellectual Type is Word Warrior. This means you have exceptional verbal skills. You can easily make sense of complex issues and take an unusually creative approach to solving problems. Your strengths also make you a visionary. Even without trying you're able to come up with lots of new and creative ideas.   When I came home this afternoon from taking my nephew swimming, I tried to take the test again, really trying to analyze the math stuff:   Your IQ score is 131  This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.  Your Intellectual Type is Insightful Linguist. This means you are highly intelligent and have the natural fluency of a writer and the visual and spatial strengths of an artist. Those skills contribute to your creative and expressive mind.   *Strokes chin*  Benj got a 136 on  his  test, math genius that he is.   Anyhow, the last time I got my IQ tested was in high school. If I remember it correctly, a legit IQ test takes into account the person's age as well. Parang ang taas ata ng 131 for me, considering that I know my previous score to be along the 110s. Too good to be true 'tong online test!

      YAHOOOOOO! Hay salamat! I heard the good news na wala ngang biochem sa boards. Just basic stuff. No more engot counting of how much ATPs liberated in one Kreb's cycle. No more Greek!  Am currently reading microbio. I kinda like it. Heehee. *blush* Germ freak kasi ako. Not germ freak as in i-like-germs. But germ freak as in...freaky germs!!! I always use my pinky (and only if I have to) to open public restroom doors, and medyo na-a-anxious ako kasi mauubos na yung Bath and Body Works grape antibacterial foam ko.  Anyhoo, I hope to finish up this microbio quick, para move on na ako to the next subject.     Ummm...sarap!    After borrowing a book from Dennis, we had lunch. Since Dennis was making leche flan yesterday, I told him to bring me one "llanera" (the oval metal thingie) today. Sarap!!! The best talaga flan ni Dennis! Medyo may coffee-ish taste yung syrup, and it's creamier in texture rather than jello-ish. Incidentally, Dennis also makes yummy adobo and saging na saba!  We had a hilarious time laughing about our nilagang-baboy adventures. I told him about my aversion to nilagang baboy, ever since that incident in the St. Peter cafeteria. The not-so mystery meat of the day was sinigang na nilagang baboy. When I used my spoon to cut through the meat-taba part, may (STOP READING IF YOU LIKE SINIGANG BABOY) (AS IN NOW!!!) (HOPE YOU HAD DINNER NA!) parang pus na lumabas!!! Ewww...aggghhhhh! Naaalala ko  may buhok pa yon.   However, in true "Wala ka sa lolo ko!!!" fashion, Dennis just had to top my story. One time, he was eating nilagang baboy din, when he came upon a rather chewy square piece of the meat. He fished out the piece with a fork...gulat siya kasi may baboy nipple on the center of the meat square. Bwahahaha!     "My water bag broke!"    Classic movie line! Anyhoo, nakalimutan ko i-kwento... earlier this week, a woman gave birth in the driveway of our old College of Dent building.   It started when my prof Doc Danny saw this woman clutching her belly in pain across Faura near the Supreme Court. The woman told him she was due in July pa. He then pointed her to the direction of PGH tapos sinamahan na rin niya patawid.  Now, to get to PGH from the Supreme Court, there's a short cut where you go through the Dent driveway. When they got there, medyo whooosh! Milky and clear fluid plus blood hit the ground. Reminds of that scene in Sex and The City where Miranda broke her bag, spilling fluid on Carrie's Christian Louboutins. Nataranta si Doc Danny so he left the woman by the guard house to call for help.  Maya-maya, yung vendor sa labas nagpahiram ng monoblock chair. Patients in the Dent lobby, a lot without teeth, became instant midwives. She gave birth right then and there. Somebody lent a surprisingly clean towel. Med students arrived. While they were waiting for the stretcher, somebody cut the cord with a Swiss knife some-kind-of-sterilized with a lighter.  It's a boy!

      I went to QC today, ALONE. To and fro! Got back in ONE PIECE!  Today was study group day at Kathy S.'s house in Bagong Pag-Asa, QC, near Project 6 and SM North EDSA. Though the route would be shorter if I took an FX, I figured the LRT-MRT route was more formulaic and would burn off more calories(due to climbing up and going down train stations).  To duplicate my feat:    Take LRT from Quirino up to the MRT connection in EDSA.  Take the MRT and get off at the North EDSA station.  Wait for a jeep that says PAG-ASA.  Wait a long time.  Ask other jeepney drivers (with the SM- Project 6 route) or MMDA personnel if the PAG-ASA jeep still exists/passes by North Ave.  Wait some more.  Finally wave down the only Pag-Asa jeep to arrive in 20 minutes and ride it into the sunset, este, subdivision.  Whoopee!  Do the study-group thingie. Time to go home!  Walk a block till you get to the street with passing FX jeeps.  Ride the FX that says MRT/SM.  Tour the SM complex for a while in the comfort of the FX.  Get off at the MRT station.  Do the MRT-LRT thing again.  Walk home!

      Hmm... mag 1-1week na rin since my last entry..hayyy ang daming nangyari!    Train sounds        Last Sunday, naging Godfather part II si Benj.. he became a ninong, so sumama ako sa reception after the baptism ceremony... di ako binigyan ng loot bag! Oh well. Later that day, we went to Powerplant, where we had free  3rd row seats   to watch   Nyoy Volantes and the Mannos (Manos?)   . Actually, pumasok lang kami sa record store tapos it turned out na may promo gig sila doon. Ang galing!!!!! *bow* talaga. Nyoy (naks, close), sings really well and he plays guitar really amazingly. Very fancy fingerwork. The mano-mannos we're great also. They played "Ticket to Ride"... with the music segueing into a great imitation of a locomotive train, complete with the choo-choo sounds, courtesy of the violin.    Sayang I didn't have a camera... talagang I have to admit that those camera phones really have an advantage at times like these. Funny lang cause the other fans... tatayo sila sa harap ni Nyoy and hold the cellphone up, like 2-3 feet away from his face and click away...     Carriedo station          Tuesday... nag commute kami ni Kathy B. via Sta. Cruz jeep papuntang Quiapo near Raon. Kathy B. is one of my "boards-mates" this December..., and we needed to buy lots of stuff for our practicals part of the exam.  Si Kathy, sanay "mag-cab". Take note, not "Mag-taxi", but mag-"cab". hehehe (Hi Kathy!). Medyo panic siya when she learned na kaming 2 girls pupunta, because originally, si Dennis ang magsasama sa amin papunta doon. Medyo nag-whine si Kathy konti, niloloko ko nga na whiner siya eh, pero I guess ok na siya nung nakarating na kami doon. We got off from the jeep when we saw Sta. Cruz church, tapos we walked under the LRT till I saw Paterno street.  Rizal avenue looks so different now! Paved na with stone tile-things... yung LRT doon, cute. Tiled yung poste ng LRT, tapos yung other parts, painted pink, cream and blue (you'll see it when you look up). Some of the stores were having renovations done. Sana hindi na maging dingy yung Rizal avenue, para safer na puntahan. We walked to Paterno...tapos nagpalit na ulit yung anyo ng pagilid into the old Quiapo, complete with pregnant homeless women fighting with each other. Oh well.  Anyway, we went to this big two-storey store na kilalang-kilala for dental supplies. Secret na lang yung pangalan. We had a very disturbing experience there, Kathy and I. Yung inassign sa amin na saleslady, si Lani... aba. Mahabang kwento... naloko talaga kami. But in a nutshell, ang nangyari was this. Binigyan kami ni Lani ng discount for a few of the items... (shempre natuwa kami). Pero yun pala, those items that she discounted, she didn't write them down in the official receipt. Well, we paid for everything (receipt-ed and non-receipt-ed items), pero yun pala yung cashier/owner, hindi alam na may kasama na wala sa resibo, isusukli niya based on what's written on the receipt diba. Ang ginawa ni Lani, kinuha niya yung pera na pinambayad namin for the "discounted" items! So naging ganito: Ang discount ko, P20. Ang discount ni Kathy B, P10. Ang nakuha ni Lani? P450. Sa dami ng binili namin, nilito niya kami. Kaya pala sabi niya sa amin "Uy quiet lang kayo ha!"  Pag labas namin ni Kathy sa tindahan, nagme-mental tally ni kami. Sabi ni Kathy, "Teka, Mali yon ah!!!". We didn't know what to do. Gusto namin isumbong. That would get her fired! Tapos may anak pa yon. Shempre naguguilty kami ni Kathy para sa may-ari. Yung nakaka-inis pa, feel na feel ni Lani na magkaconchaba kaming 3. Sabi ko kay Kath, next time wag na tayo magpapa-assist kay Lani. Pero naiisip ko pa rin na gusto ko pa rin siya isumbong. Haynaku.  Afterwards... sumakay na lang kami ng LRT sa Carriedo station, sa WOMEN ONLY section shempre. Medyo funny, may mamang nagline-jump, ang kapal ng mukha, pumasok sa women's area na sobrang pa-simple. I saw a librarian-type-looking woman tell him off (kulang na lang pukpukin ng payong. heehee). Nung una he tried to look as if he didn't care, pero I guess he got too many angry stares kaya bumaba na siya sa next station.     Joy ride          Wednesday morning, nagpasama ako kay Dennis to go to the Mendiola area naman, near UE and CEU, to buy more dental stuff. Kathy B. and MJ were supposed to join, pero K had cramps, tapos si MJ medyo tinamad ata :).  So Dennis and I stood on the corner of Pedro Gil and Taft, debating on which jeep/bus to take, when we saw some lower classmen of UPCD, sina EJ, Chia, Abbie and Michelle. Nagyaya sila mag Jollibee, so since hindi pa nagbreakfast si Dennis, we joined them muna. When we asked them kung pano pumunta doon sa dental supply na yon... Chia offered the services of her driver, kasi wala naman daw gagawin. Serendipitous! Galing ni God.. kasi tamang-tama, nung sasakay na kami, bumuhos yung malakas na ulan.  Nakarating kami ni Dennis sa Reddy's, yung suki namin... or teka, kami ang suki sa Reddy's? (Interchangeable ba ang "suki"?). Anyhow, favorite namin yung tindera na si Ate Jac...malakas talaga magdiscount yon (yung honest kind of discount). Nakachismis pa namin si Ate Jac and yung kapatid ng may-ari (na medyo magulo kausapin, siguro may hearing disorder?).  Afterwards, after buying other stuff near CEU, nakita namin ni Dennis yung railway ng LRT2. Out of curiosity, we wanted to see what the station looked like. Medyo nagsisisi kami nung una in our minds, kasi nawala pa kami around San Sebastian trying to find where the station was. In a 3-Kings-Looking-for-the-Star-of-Bethlehem kind of way, we walked along Legarda following the station line.  Hi tech na ngayon ang mga gumagawa ng fake diplomas and thesis-while you wait. At the corner of one busyintersection, may nakita kami na mga nagraracket na may nakaplug-in na computer and printer (Word for Windows pa ang gamit)...in daylight ha, walang stalls or anything, as in sa isang kanto kung saan may mga nagaantay tumawid.  Finally, after walking some more, we saw the Legarda station of the LRT-2. Golly gulaman! (as my boards-mate Jen R. would say). Ang gandahhhh (tulo-laway). Yes, there is hope for the Philippines, well, at least where commuters are concerned. The station looked like the stations one might see in HK or Singapore. Upon close inspection of some posted plaques, we found out that the station was partly funded by the Japanese government. Designed in silver and purple (thus, called, "Purple Line"), the station looks not unlike NAIA-2, full of matte-silver frames and glass.  And elevators. There are clean, working elevators for the disabled. There are no shortage of working upway escalators too. And get this.  Automated, ticket vending machines... with SHORT LINES. In the Philippines.  There were machines for bills and coins which could accept bills for up to P50, and other machines just for coins. You press a button choosing your destination, insert the money, and out pops the card and your change. Also, there are system maps to show you where the line goes in easy to understand detail. Di kami nakatiis, gusto naming mag joy ride! Funny lang, kasi Dennis apparently used a P50 bill for his one ticket (ticket prices are similar to LRT and MRT). Para siyang nanalo ng slot machines with the change coming out all in one-peso coins, complete with the taktaktak-chink-chink-chink sounds.  We each had a ticket to go to the farthest end of the line... in Marikina. The line goes mainly above Aurora avenue, and you can reach SM Centerpoint, New Manila, Katipunan, Araneta Center in Cubao, Katipunan... The train itself is another gush-worthy matter. It is 50% wider than the LRT or MRT, and it's not divided into coaches. Thus, if trip mo lang, you could cartwheel from one end to another. We noticed two security guards walking along the train. The ride felt so much safer talaga.  We reached Marikina in more or less, 20 minutes. The train's starting point was still Legarda, since hindi pa connected yung line to the LRT in Recto (target date: December 2004). We decide to take a train back to Araneta and have lunch there. Dennis and I both agreed that this new LRT certainly opened up more possibilities for getting around Metro Manila. A few months ago we would never have thought of eating lunch in Araneta Center!  After eating, we walked to the MRT because Dennis needed to go to Ayala. I decided to go home via MRT up to Taft, then LRT up to Quirino. Pag-akyat namin sa MRT station...kablag! Our hopes for the Philippines suffered a setback. The station was PACKED with people lining up outside just 3 windows. The station was so dark pa. Oh well. While lining up, we ran into Shawie, our classmate Bernard's friend. We bought Shawie her ticket and we three rode together.       "Ikiskis ba!?!"               Shempre, kwentuhan with Shawie. Kinuwento niya about her past experience last week inside the MRT train. It was packed that time and there was a man half-beside/half-behind her. really close. After a while, as Shawie said,  " Napansin kong medyo nabuhay si manoy ."  Indignant, she whipped around to face the guy and said loudly, "Ikiskis ba!?!".(natawa kami ni Dennis sa hirit ni Shawie) . Anyhoo, Shawie told him off (loudly for the rest of the passengers to hear) before she got off the train. Namula daw yung mama. Apparently, the guy was going to get off at a farther stop, so she hoped that the guy would suffer from embarassment na lang for the rest of his ride.   Ayun, Shawie and Dennis got off at Ayala while I continued my commute home.
