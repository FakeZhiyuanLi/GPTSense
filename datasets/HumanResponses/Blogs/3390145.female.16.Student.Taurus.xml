        well today started out kinda slow adn boring but it is getting better, it is still really hot but i hope it will rain soon.  i had been playing hide in go seek wiht my brother, it was fun we had all the lights out aand it was really dark in the house. sometimes i forget how much fun he can actually be.  even though i love my parents and my brother alot i was getting mad last night becasue since i am the oldest and the first child i had the rules put down for me from the beggining, i have always been more or less a good person i dont rebel or anything like that but my brother coming so much later he has it really easy, my parents barely set rules for him when i was his age i was probably in bed at 8:30 he does not go to bed until like 10-11 and that is not good...i guess i am just jealous becasue for 9 yrs. i was an only child used to getting all the attention and i never noticed the rules becasue i had nothing to compare it to. when my brother was born adn he got older i noticed a lot of differet treatment.  well i guess i should just be thankful that i have a loving family...g2g           love             mandi

        well sorry i have not written in a couple of days...i am kinda confused lately...as i was talking to jess,wee,chris and yoshie tonight i realized that they talk about things that i dont approve of... not jess or chris or even so much wee...i dont even know yoshie that well and she came aceoss as very"provocitive "tonight...maybe it was just the circumstances because i know the feeling of the chat room taking you away and you say things that you would not normally say but from what jess has told me about her i ma going ot say that most likely...well i will catch up later                             love,                                mandi

        i am soooo tired of florida...i had ot walk my brother to summer school today, adn it is so hot,  want ot move...i know that if my dad wins that contest and we do move to st augistine it will not be differrent but it would be right by the beach so we would have water to swim in and the breezes coming off the water...i can dream cant I?  i am tired of being lonely last night i was crying...nate signed his last e mail to me( before he left for camp) with John 15:13 and later i looked it up and it is very sweet ."greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends"-John 15:13  i thought that was sweet, now dont get me wrong i dont think that he is trying to say something or anything like that i just thought that was a nice thought...that is another thing i have been having a hard time with lately, why would anyone like me when they could have so many of the other beautiful girls out in the world...it'sa depressing thought...well i have ot go do laundry                         love ya,                               mandi

      i had a dream last night that is making me go haywire!!!!  it was a dream about anthony dichristopher ( a boy who i had a major crush on in the 8th grade i thought i might actually have a chance in hell with and he goes out with that little skank katie...that day that she ran up to me sooooo excited bc anthony said he liked her was a really hard day for me ) but anyways the dream was that we were at my grandmothers house and there was some sort of contest and my team was losing ( my team was ppl from the real world...hahahaha) and we were losing on the first day of the contest so the 2nd day we kicked ppl off and got some new players...one of the new players was anthony...and in the dream we really hit it off and he and a few of my team mates tried ot play a trick on me and they played it off like one of the stunts killed him (I KEEL YOU!!!!) and this big tough guy was telling that to me and i ran into my grandmothers bathroom ( no idea why we are in iowa.....lol) and i start crying hysterically and was really upset about it, they felt really bad about it they did not think i would take it so badly so the big guy tells me it was just a joke and that anthony was sitting at the table with my grandma. so i walked into the dining room and my grandma was fixing his game pass for the contest and he was smiling and was trying to apoligize but i walked right past him bc i was pissed about the trick and i go and sit on the couch in the living room and he follows me in there and gave me the most amazing kiss (end dream lol)....i am such a dweeb....lol. i am consiering calling him but he could have moved and what exactly am i going to say i have not seen him in 2 yrs...ok i need ot stop acting like a love sick pupply it was just a dream nothing more!!!!!!!!...i remember in 8th grade while he was going out with katie we came back from the bowling trip and he walks up to me  ( our class had been at lunch and he stayed there ) and says mandi erica just told me you liked me so i broke up with katie so i couls go out with you and put his arm around my sholder and i thought i would puke all over him i knew he was joking about the whole thing but a apart of me wished it were true....he was so crazy and i am just now realizing how much i actually liked him i mean i knew i liked him but when he started going out with katie i started focusing more on alex (eeeeeewwwwwwwwww   big mistake there, i can not believe i actually started to like him again last year!!!!! eeeeewwwwwww)i loved anthony (like a friend) so much he was so much fun i will never forget when we dared him ot ask alex ot marry him and he did it and everything got down on one knee and it was halarious...that was a fun year...i guess i just never realized it....lol...i wonder if i should call him and see if he would like ot go to teh movies (AS FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!)i am making myself sick....

         well today was ok i got up and started cleaning but about 15 mins into cleaning my parents decided that we should all go grocery shopping (usually it is just them) so i did not get to finish my cleaning...for some reason i feel like when i clean i can just think and block out everything else that&nbsp;is going on. so we went ot the grocery store and when we had gotten back the house still needed picked up so i cleaned while my mother made dinner (tacos) and then we sat down and ate and i felt like for the first time in a while we actually talked at teh dinner table instead of just my mom or dad's work or other problems inside the family...i know it sounds corney but it felt good ot be a familt again, now that my dad has been working two jobs we dont see him much and it is usually just my mom jj nad me at dinner but my mom and dad say that he will only have ot work like that for two more weeks...we are supposed to be watching movies right now but they are watching black adder and i have already seen that episode so i came in here after it we will watch run away jury and dark city...last night i went out with jess,susan, and court...it was nice we saw anchorman and it was funny and afterwards me and jess went to krispy kreme to sit and wait for my mom it was a nice break from the walls of the house...i am not feeling too well today i feel just a bit sick ...well i guess i will go and write more later

         i hate little kids so much!!!! a few days ago i threw jayson's ball outside becasue he was throwing it in the house and. yesterday we saw it in the neighbors yard so i went and got it and put it in mommy's car. so i go to check the mail today and one of the little hispanic girls comes up to me and says (in an extremely bad attitude!!) "exscuse me did you take that purple ball that was in our yard yesterday?" and i said "yes because it is our ball" and she said "no it is not it is my friends ball" so i said "stop lying becasue it was our ball we threw it outside yesterday and you know you are lying" so she goes"shut up bitch it is my friends ball" so i go "stop lying!" and she says "no you ho!" so i said "whatever you know you are lying so fuck you!" and i started walking away and she said "no fuck you" and i just kept walking and about 3 mins later someone comes knocking on our door and they keep knocking for like 5 mins but i was not going to answer it without one of my parents home. i do not understand why little kids have such attitudes now! i mean this girl can not be older than nine and she is calling me a bitch!!!! i hate this place i really hope we can get out of here sooner rather that later...

       hey,   for some reason it seems like all my friends are abandoning me... i have not talked to susan in about 2 weeks and  when i just signed on to msn neil signed off almost instantly. maybe i am paranoid but i have good reason to... i bought a lot of new clothes for school yesterday cant decide what to wear tomorrow night though but i know what i am wearing on the rirst day of school. white spagetti strap with blue tank over with dark blue jeans, can not decide on shoes though...i think i will wear my hair curly and i na blue headband that matches teh shirt exactly. i played dress up today and dressed up as a "rocker chic" it was fun but if my friends had saw the clothes and make up they would all laugh at me even though i liked it . my mom bought me the ashlee simpson cd last night and i was sooooooo happy , i mean i finally have it!!! now i just want jamie cullums (sp?!?!) twenty-something. well i guess my depressed ass will go and depress myself even more now well goodbye
