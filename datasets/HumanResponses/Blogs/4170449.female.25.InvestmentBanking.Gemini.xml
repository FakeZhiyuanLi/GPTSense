       I think everyone can write a book and publish it even though they are not famous, successful, or talented. Not only special people, but also normal people can have great messages to deliver. I  'd like to prove this as a normal person so than I wish to encourage people to write their own stories which can make their life more meaningful and challengable.       I think "Life Is Learning Experieances."     This will be the title for my book.   Here are my Life lessions, plans, and some notes which I've learned from experieances.   Thinking of the day when my book publish makes me so excited.   I don't know how long it'll take However,,     I totally believe that my dream, having my own book will come true...

       There are three kinds of people.   First, people who say things behind you. They would not be really true firends but those who you should be away from.   Second, people who doesn't say much, or say some good things about you. They might be your good friends but still not the best friends.    Third,   people who gave you advices especially about your weeknesses. They are my     family and some friends to me. I consider them as my best true friends who will be there for me for good.

       Jinhye got a guest from Janpan who was her house host during her staying in Janpan.   I joined them, had lunch together and went shopping with them.   There was nothing much I've done for him, but I was surprised to get a presant from him   before I say good bye to him. It was nice cookies.      I used to ask a lot of favors to my friends, families, co-workers, and strangers.   I doubt whether I expressed enough to them how much I was thankful becase of them.   I should say thank you everytime I get a help from somebody and I have to payback to them.   Otherwise, those people might misunderstand as being used.      I think  one of the secret for keeping a long relationship with someone is     expressing truthfully how much you are thankful to the person everytime you get a favor from him or her.

       The most important people will be my family.   So, it's my family whom I should be careful the most for them not to be hurt.   Actually, I used to thought that my family, my close friends were the last people whom I have to be careful   thinking that they will always be there for me.   S  ometimes it happened that I hurt them so badly even though I didn't mean that at all.   I love my family and my friends, who   are the most important people for my life.    I will do my best to all of my loving poeple not to be hurt, but to be happy because of me.

       I was too innocent or stupid not to know this earlier.    Trust is the most important thing to keep all of relationship among couples, friends, colleagues and family.   I think " Trusting somebody is your own firm belief about the person which doesn't change by others ."    When you judge someone, you should be careful that you make your own decision base on your idea about the person not base on the other's words, because it's you to know the person better and even you don't know the other's will or intension if it's totally ture.
