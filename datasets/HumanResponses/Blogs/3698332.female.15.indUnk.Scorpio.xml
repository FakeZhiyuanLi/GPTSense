       urlLink       Take the  urlLink What High School Stereotype Are You?  quiz.  Found this test on my friend's livejournal- http://www.livejournal.com/users/reimeiki. I decided to take the test and see what I am just for the heck of it. And there I am! Were you expecting it? It halfway surprised me, because I don't think I usually "act" like an outsider, but maybe I'm an outsider on the inside... Oxymoron, lol... Or maybe there wasn't the stereotype of "Just there, fun to be with when there's no one better." What would you call that, anyway? Hmm... Well, that's besides the point. Go take the test. Now. ^^

      Scotch tape is so totally the best for creating a sculpture because sculptures should represent something important to life, and scotch tape is about as important as taking a shower every day. (I don't know about you, but that's VERY important to me.) I think making a sculpture out of scotch tape would be an apt and well deserved tribute to that common household accessory people are always looking for and never have enough of, especially around Christmas. ^___^ Come on, agree with me. You know you want to.

      How exactly do you start off on one of these? Does it just get easier as you go along? Does the thought of spilling your guts to the entire world become normal after awhile?   Yes. I still don't know why I'm here. Well, that's not exactly true. *glares at Zach* He started me on it. It's all his fault.  So... Should I talk about me? I could do that... It's one of my favorite hobbies. ^^  My name is Jessica. I'm 15... I live in the middle of nowhere, Colorado. Seriously. 70 miles to the closest McDonalds french fry... Want to diet? Come out here. I'd be glad for a next door neighbor closer than 3 miles away!  I'm 5'2. (Yes, a munchkin, you don't have to tell me. -.-) I have green eyes, short brown hair soon to be dyed black, and the whitest skin on this side of the moon. (Just call me albino... lol) Lol is my favorite word, so you'll have to forgive me if I use it too much. I think I say lol too much because I laugh at the ironic situations in life, and of course life is always so ironic in it's crueltly, so there's always something to laugh about... wheee! I love writing. Obsessed with it. Something I've always wanted to do since... Well, since forever. Or at least as long as the time I knew how to hold a crayon. XP If by some miracle you would like to read my stuff, just go to  http://www.fictionpress.com/~lillalita  or  http://www.fanfiction.net/~lalita  I think those work... Anywho, I like anime (Megami Kouhosei is the BEST, no matter what anyone thinks,) Harry Potter, any book I can get my hands on, LoTR, Orlando Bloom, Eminem, Three Days Grace, Evanesence... Umm... Shopping, sleeping, eating, breathing, boys, more boys, RPGs and all that good stuff. I promise I am semi-normal... at least I think I am... *shrugs*  I don't know what else to say. Peace out? (XP)
