      Hey where did we go Days when the rains came Down in a hollow Playin' a new game  Laughin' and a runnin' Skippin' and a jumpin' In the misty mornin' fog Ah with our hearts a thumpin' Was you my brown eyed girl You my brown eyed girl  Now what ever happened Tuesday is oh so slow Goin' down the old mine with a Transistor radio  Standin' in a sunlit lane Hidin' 'hind a rainbow's wall Slippin' and a slidin' yeah All along the waterfall It was you my brown eyed girl You my brown eyed girl  Do you remember when We used to sing Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da  So hard to find my way Now that I'm on my own Thought about it just the other day My, where'd the times all gone  Can't remember back then Lord Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout Makin' love in the green grass Uh behind the stadium With you my brown eyed girl You my brown eyed girl  Do you remember when We used to sing Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da Yeah Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da Oh oh oh oh Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da Oh oh oh oh Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da

       Tried to amend my carnivorous habit  Made it nearly seventy days  Losing weight without speed eating sunflower seeds  Drinking lots of carrot juice and soaking up rays  But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams  Some kind of sensuous treat  Not zucchini fettucini or bulgar wheat  But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat    Cheeseburger in paradise  Heaven on earth with an onion slice  Not too particular not too precise  I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise    Heard about the oldtime sailor men  They'd eat the same thing again and again  Warm beer and bread they said could raise the dead  Well it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn  But times have changed for sailors these days  When I'm in port I get what I need  Not just havanas or banana or daiquiris  But that American creation on which I feed    Cheeseburger in paradise  Medium-rare with mustard'd be nice  Heaven on earth with an onion slice  I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise    I like mine with lettuce and tomato  Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes  Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer  Well good God almighty which way do I steer  For my...  Cheeseburger in paradise  Making the best of every virtue and vice  Worth every d*** bit of sacrifice  To get a cheeseburger in paradise  Get me a cheeseburger in paradise  I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise    I like mine with lettuce and tomato  Heinz 57 and french fried potatos  Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer  Well good God almighty which way do I steer

       Now the day is done  And I sit alone and think of you girl  What would I do without you in my life    Wonderin' if you love me or  just playing a fool of me.  Well I hope you understand  I just had to go back to the island    And watch the sun go down  Listen to the sea roll in  I'll be thinkin' of you  And how it might've been  Listen to the nightbird cry  Watch the sun set die  Well I hope you understand  I just had to go back to the island    Threaded in my heart  Tears are falling down  I know down in my soul  I'm really gonna miss you    Caan't end this way  For all the games we've played.  So I hope you understand  I just had to go back to the island    And watch the sun go down  Listen to the sea roll in  I'll be thinkin' of you  And how it might've been  Listen to the nightbird cry  Watch the sun set die  Well I hope you understand  I just had to go back to the island    And watch the sun go down  Listen to the sea roll in  I'll be thinkin' of you  And how it might've been  Listen to the nightbird cry  Watch the sun set die  Well I hope you understand  I just had to go back to the island    I hope you understand  I just had to go back to the island

        Nibblin' on sponge cake  Watching the sun bake  All of those tourists covered with oil  Strumming my six-string  On my front porch swing  Smell those shrimp, they're beginning to boil    Wasted away again in Margaritaville  Searching for my lost shaker of salt  Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  But I know  It's nobody's fault    I don't know the reason  I stayed here all season  Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo  But it's a real beauty  A Mexican cutie  How it got here I haven't a clue    Wasted away again in Margaritaville  Searching for my lost shaker of salt  Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  Now I think  H***, it could be my fault    I blew out my flip-flop  Stepped on a pop-top  Cut my heal had to cruise on back home  But there's booze in the blender  And soon it will render  That frozen concoction that helps me hang on    Wasted away again in Margaritaville  Searching for my lost shaker of salt  Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  But I know  It's my own d***ed fault    Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame  And I know  It's my owned d***ed fault

        It hardly seems a long time Just a minute of the day When the man that stood beside me More than gave himself away A food stain on his spotted shirt A gray beard on his face A man composed of many names So I just called him Ace  Chorus:  But Ace can't read and Ace can't write  And he sleeps on a bench at night  A little man the world has left behind  He ain't bitter, he ain't sweet  Makes his living on the street  Never knowing what he's going to find  Born in Mississippi Picking cotton as a child Left soon for the city Where he heard that life was wild That was fifty years ago When nothing's really strange >From a poor dirt farm to dirty streets That really ain't much change  Chorus:  But Ace can't read and Ace can't write  And he sleeps on a bench at night  A little man the world has left behind  He ain't bitter, he ain't sweet  Makes his living on the street  Never knowing what he's going to find  Go back to the country No he can't do that Wasted years have left him nothing but an old straw hat So he puts it on his head And waves his last god-bye With no time left to turn around And no time to ask why  Chorus:  But Ace can't read and Ace can't write  And he sleeps on a bench at night  A little man the world has left behind  He ain't bitter, he ain't sweet  Makes his living on the street  Never knowing what he's going to find  And this old world has left poor Ace behind

       Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call, Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall.  You've seen it all, You've seen it all.  Watched the men who rode you, Switch from sails to steam. And in your belly you hold the treasure That few have ever seen, Most of them dreams, Most of them dreams.  Yes, I am a pirate Two hundred years too late. The cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder I'm an over forty victim of fate; arriving too late Arriving too late.  I've done a bit of smugglin' I've run my share of grass. I made enough money to buy Miami, But I pissed it away so fast, Never meant to last, Never meant to last.  I have been drunk now for over two weeks, I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks, but I've got to stop wishin',  got to go fishin' I'm down to rock bottom again. Just a few friends, Just a few friends.  (Instrumental)  I go for younger women, Lived with several awhile, And though I ran away, They'll come back one day. And still I can manage a smile It just takes awhile, just takes awhile.  Mother mother ocean, after all these years I've found My occupational hazard being my occupation's just not around I feel like I've drowned, gonna head uptown.

       Ramadan is over, The new moon's shown her face, I'm halfway round the planet, In a most unlikely place.  Following my song line Past bamboo shacks and shops Behind a jitney packed like sardines, With bananas piled on top.  I ran away from politics, It's too bizarre at home. Away I flew, tuned into Blue "Maybe Amsterdam or Rome"  Awakened by a stewardess, With Spain somewhere below. On the threshold of adventure, God I do love this job so.  So while I make my move On the big board game Up and down a Spanish highway, Some things remain the same. Girls meet boys and the boys tease girls I'm heading out this morning, For the Far Side of the World.  Oh I believe in song lines Obvious and not I'd ridden them like camels To some most peculiar spots.  They run across the oceans Through mountains and saloons And tonight out to the dessert Where I sit atop this dune.  I was destined for this vantage point Which is so far from the Sea I've lived it in the pages of Saint-Exupery  From Paris to Tunisia Casablanca to Dakar I was riding long before I flew Through the wind and sand and stars.  Caravan Ride that hump And Timbuktu's a jillion bumps Sleeping bags and battle flags Are coiled and furled That's the way you travel To the far side of the world!  A Sunset framed by lightening bolts Burns a lasting memory And a string of tiny twinkling lights adorn the sausage tree. While the embers from the log fire Flicker, fly, and twirl Then drift off toward the cosmos From the Far Side of the World. Well it's Christ
