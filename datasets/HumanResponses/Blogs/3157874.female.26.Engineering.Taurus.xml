      so, I'm lazy about doing anything recently... but I think that's ok. I deserve to take some time and get my life figured out a bit. I took some footage of my friend clowning around during the freemont street experience light show. I'll post once edited.

      the number to the right over there by itself is my count down to anime expo! (yay!!)  I'm going to put a box around it stating as much.  I changed hosting companies again, wich means this thing should be up now around the clock. I had my second anxiety attack ever tonight. Not good. this one was not nearly as bad as the first, tho. No screaming and crying and hyperventalation this time.  I don't know if anyone really knows how hard things are for me right now. And it's for no reason whatsoever.  Well, there are reasons but it's not like anything happened that triggered it. Man, I hate myself. And what's worse is I hate hating myself even more than I hate myself. Actually I think that's a good thing (if you can translate the previous sentence from Susan-speak), it most likely means I'm ready to actually get help. Basically I am so sick of hating myself the only option is to get professional help. So I am.

      So, how can I keep my rat from biting me?  It's not like she bites hard, but it's really pissing me off.  I really like this rat, even tho she's kinda goofy. I guess I just feel like posting something here to get in to the 'spirit' of this whole blogging thing.  So, the rat is the only thing I can think of that's not like an incredibly seriouls topic right now.  Ninja Squeaks isn't going to make me cry, unless she starts biting harder of course.  Why does life have to be so full of stupid drama?!? It was never like this before.  It has something to do with 2004, I'm convinced.  My 14 year depression has hit a new high (or low depending on how you look at it).  I'm so sick of being depressed. blah.

      My friend is getting married in October.  That's really cool and all the only thing is the dude lives in England.  So she's been planning for months to go to the British Consulate in Los Angeles to get her visa.  She doesn't drive so I agreed to drive her. It would be a nifty little road trip before she moves across the freaking planet.   So I took a day off of work and drove us all the way to Los Angeles and they wouldn't give her the visa.  It was already paid for and everything!  I guess if you get the fiance visa you have to be getting married in the UK.  Apparently nobody informed her or her man of this fact. Whatever!    So our trip was wasted but we had an good time anyway(after getting over being pissed off about the visa).  We went to Venice and did a little bit of shopping. Well, as much as 2 broke people can shop.  The room we ended up staying in looked like it belonged to someone's grandma who lived on a rural farm somewhere. I made a small documentary about this fact. My first actual "movie",  if you can call it that. You can't but it's still funny.  If you have read this far you are required to watch the movie and leave some kind of (preferably favorable) comment. You can't say I'm lame cause I already know.      urlLink larger version   urlLink small version

      So here's a really cute picture I took of my parents dog, probably the best ever Bob picture:   Not that you can tell but I took this right after he'd been groomed.   I've been sick all weekend. Not really sick, but just sick enough to make me sleep all weekend.  Wich *really* sucks because work is kinda critical right now, and I'm driving to California tomorrow night.  I'm bummed because I missed my weekend.  There was a whole bunch of stuff I wanted to do this weekend and people I haven't seen in awhile that I wanted to see, and I missed out!! You know the feeling when you're sick and you feel like you're missing out on your own life?   Nobody I've told to come here and commet has been commenting. Grrrrr!!!!

      It's so strange, it's as if nothing is going on, yet so much stuff is happening. *THREE* trips to California between now and the 5th of next month!  Softball is starting up again, people are getting married, etc.  All this stuff costs MONEY!! Wich I have very little of.  :( Just got paid today, trying to see how far I can s-t-r-e-t-c-h it all. sheesh.

      It's the most entertaining thing in the world having a chat bot, I have discovered.  What I don't quite understand is why some of the same people come and talk to the bot repeatedly.   And yes, I am still looking into programming a zork bot.      So, my wonderful friend Romina has made a deal with me.  She has agreed to give me another pedicure as long as I post a picture of my newly decorated piggies here. But of course.     I threw out my bed. As of tonight I am sleeping on a beanbag bed for awhile.

      So I went to sharkreef last week and here is a picture I took (with the new camera of course) of a lionfish:     and an alligator:    I thought both of them came out pretty good. I have video too, but the battery on my camera died, so I need to charge it.  I've still been lazy, I'm trying to make an effort to take better care of myself. Which is going OK, except for the bed situation.  Last night I couldn't sleep.  First off my bed is a hand-me-down bed and it is bowed in the middle. Secondly, my ears are sore cause I got them pierecd for the fourth time so I can't quite lie on my side properly. Then I realized that my fish tank needed water cause it was making too much noise, so I finally gave in to that and put some water in the tank. Then I found a semi-cofortable spot on the bed and a leftover cricket in the lizard's cage started chirping, so I shut my door.  I was unable to get comfortable on the bed so I finally got up and turned my  urlLink beanbag  into a bed and dragged it into the middle of my bedroom floor (not that easy of a feat for one person, it's a king size). By this time it is like 4:20 in the am. Finally Ninja Squeaks decided she had never had a drink in her life and spent like 10 minutes emptying her water bottle.  So now my dillema is weather I should keep the beanbag as a bed, using it soley as my bed, or trek accross town to pick up another hand-me-down bed from a friend tomorrow. Either way the bed I have now is going in the dumpster tomorrow.  In other news, I'm very pissed off, no way in hell do I agree with:  urlLink this list .  Some of it goes without saying, but "We Didn't Start the Fire" by Billy Joel, "What's Up?" by 4 Non Blondes?? Just to point out a couple of their misrepresented songs... sheesh who the hell put toghether this list anyway!?!  OK, so I'm done ranting there. That's all I have to say for this evening. More sooner this time (shush  urlLink Robert ).

      I just found out that my bot has 292 users!!&nbsp; I'm so stoked.&nbsp; That's from just evenings/weekends. I'm going to start leaving my computer on all day during the week....  &nbsp;  This is a picture of me in the exhibit hall at anime expo 2004. I like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;      &nbsp;  I have recently become addicted to  urlLink ragnarok .&nbsp; It's been&nbsp; a fun distraction.&nbsp; I'm going to be a crusader eventually.&nbsp; yay.  &nbsp;

      Must BITCH:&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the car dealership and picked up my 'green slip' (the thing I need to get my car registered) and somewhere in between the dealership and the DMV, I LOST THE GREEN SLIP!!!!!! So, I still can't register my car.&nbsp; However we did manage to get my old car registered to my parents (they're buying it) so now I have my old plates to put on the new car.&nbsp; At least *something* got accomplished today. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Mostly because I have been sick for about a week immediately upon returning back from anime expo. :0( As I begin the journey to rejoin the world of the functional, here is a picture of my car:    and a picture of me with said car:
