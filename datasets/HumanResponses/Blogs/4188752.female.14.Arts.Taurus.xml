          Hey guys whtas up....Well i went to my aunts house today....it was boring but hey i got Arby's..lol.....So I am abou to call Dani and see if she wnts to come over for a little bit.....Shes not online (which is a big surprise) but maybe shes watchin a movie or something....OH!..I got my first CCS issue in the mail....YAY!...lol.....Oh and i added the  chorus and chords to one of my ongs "would you"       Boy it sure is boring sitting here not knowing what to do but as i said i am going to pick up the phone right now and see if Danielle is home....Its ringing but i dont think i dialed the right number...lol....Ok I did...Man......shes not home...:(....Oh well.......Ok well any way heres the newly updated verson of my poem...      If I shed a tear for you, would you want to cry?   If I gave my life for you, would you want to die?   And if I fought for you, would you even care?   If I went to Hell for you, would you walk me there?   If I kept your picture in a golden frame   If I lit a candle every time I heard your name   If I gave my last breath for you to have one more   Would you use it to tell me good bye or would you close the door?   Would you even think of me or would you just go?   Would you even care, do you even know?       (chorus)    Would you   Would you wipe away my tears?   and would you   Would you vanish all my fears?   would you   Would you be.....my everythig?            (repeat)         If I gave you my last match so you could have some light   Would you help me in the darkness, make everything alright?   And if this was the last time you ever heard from me   Would you try to fight it or would you let it be?   If I died tomorrow, would you let it be true?   Or would you just forget me, forget I was ever with you?   Please don't forget me when I am gone   Please don't just move on   Please remember all the good times we share    And if I go to Hell for you please walk me there                                                                                                                              ~LeA~                    P.S..."Go Get Fuked..."

              Hey so there is this girl Brittney and She is 13 and she thinks she is Big Shit....So Brittney thinks she's so cool becasue she said something to me and I told her "I sware to god if i ever see you again your garenteed to get your ass beat" and she just laughs like she has NO Brain....But Then she says crap about Danielle and i'm like "Do you know shes going into 11th grade and can probly kick the living shit out of you?" and then she just looks at me.... But anyway i just got my hair streaked and its hott....Me adn Dani are kind of fighting but i think it'll be ok.......Well I got my contacts in and my hair streaked......Now all i need is a Camera....lol....but i really do need to post some picture of me with my new look.....Man i am FUCKING FREEZING!!!  So i wrote a song called "Boys will be Boys" and one called "That Moment"      That moment, like a paradise,   That kiss like a dream,   The moment that you held me,   Was sadder than it seemed.      That moment proved you loved me,   That moment proved you cared,   That moment like a heartbreak,   That moment i got scared.      I know that i can't have you,   So don't play with my heart,   It hurts to know you love her,   And that you'll never part.      I want you more than ever,   I wish that you were mine,   Darling won't you tell me,   If i'm wasting my time.      If you really love me,   You'll tell me that it's true,   I've always been so honest,   Admitting my love for you.      This hearbreak is so painful,   Please ease me from this pain,   Your caring words are hurting me,   Your driving me insane .                                                                     ~Lea~
