      It's been five days, its probably looking like a prune with wings, unless all that humidity from the shower keeps on rejuvenating it everyday. Hard to say, I dont believe I've ever had a decomposing fly in my shower.

      This bug experiment could be very interesting. I don't think it would take long to decompose. I do believe that it may start to smell. Exactly how large is this bug?

      "Disappearer" is neater than "Fake Plastic Trees"?  I don't reckon so, Gio.  Anyway, does anybody else have theories about my decomposing shower bug?  And does anybody know if Mrs Soto is actually planning on  joining  this bloody blog?

      Annette is an eighth-grader who rides my bus.  It's unreleased so the title varies.   It died falling from the tree.   "Disappearer" is the neatest song. Sonic Youth are so uberneat.

      Lovely indeed.  The work of a cat, perhaps?  'No wait but listen, I'm talking to you No wait but listen, I'm talking to you No wait but listen, I'm talking to you No wait but listen, I'm talking to you  Well I'm the only one here who can save this man's life. Trust me I've got a P.h.D. and a knife. You see his wound is to the right--no--left side head. Check his pulse; OH MY GOD, this man has gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone.....'  That would be "No wait, but listen, I'm talking to you", by Rooney.  Well, part of it, anyway.  You know, Gio, I looked up the words, and it seemed to be called "Gone".

      One day after school, I was walking home from my bus stop when I noticed something furry in the middle of the road. I approached it and identified it as a dead squirrel. It was located under the less stable branches of a live oak tree. We had witnessed some regional squirrels fall out of palm trees only to bounce back off the concrete and run back up again. This one appeared to not have survived its tumble. Annette noticed that I was staring at something in the middle of the street, and ran over to examine the situation. We conceded that the squirrel needed to be at least removed from the way of oncoming traffic, so we grabbed a branch and pushed it toward the neighbor's yard. At one point Annette accidentally flipped it over to see that it had blood all over its head and face.

      hey, isa thanks. does a puddle count as a geographic feature?

      I disagree. Isn't a geographic feature like in a national park or something rather than in a puddle?

      Maria: I think geographic feature means like near a lake or on a hill or by a mountain or something. Im not quite sure though. Hi everybody!

      Hello everybody. I kind of forgot about the blog until today. So, here I am! What did I miss? Don't answer that. That would turn out to be a very long entry, wouldn't it? I guess I'll just have to read it to see what I've missed. Won't I?

      forget how fast it decomposes, it only takes about 24 hours for fly eggs to hatch into larvae. and they live from about 6 to 10 days. imagine if that's how humans were. wouldn't that be highly inconvenient

      Er, likely pretty quick. When we semi-buried that dead squirrel, it decomposed in less than a week.

      I had a very interesting moment today.....here is what happened: I was in the shower, and, seeing as our windows have been open because of the weather, there are various mosquitos in the house.  However, in my bathroom, was not a mosquito, but a jolly overgrown fly.  I don't like flies.  Especially when I'm washing my hair.  So, I pick up a deadly weapon (i.e. a bottle of Pantene), and smash it against the (then closed, seeing as I was showering) window (don't worry--the bottom of the window is at eye-level).  Our windows are very interesting.  On the inside, there is a screen (which obviously doesn't work), and, on the outside, glass.  To open the window, you turn a knob and the glass moves, but not the screen.  So this corpse of a fly was trapped, with its tail end (or its front end--don't particularly care to look) smooshed into the screen. My question is, how long will it take for the fly's body to begin decomposition, with the added factors of daily heat and extreme humidity for about half an hour (shower time + amount of time for steam to disperse)?  Any idears?

      Must share with the folkses:  Mmm....just enjoyed a really fab meal.  Consisted of: zucchini, squash, pumpkin, potato and green beans and minced shallots brushed with olive oil and baked in the oven.  With couscous.  For dessert: peaches.  As a late-night snack: a cup of milk with a square of chocolate dropped in.  While I'm at it, I think I'll describe my entire day's worth of food.  Okay.   Breakfast: a nectarine. Lunch: homemade bread--homemade by yours truly--with avocado, tomato and a bit of garlic.  Salad, and a nectarine.  Oh yeah.  A piece of cheese too. Afternoon snacks: popcorn, 2 Tagalongs and 2 Thin Mints (these I stole from Araceli).  An apple with peanut butter--I LOVE peanut butter.    So.  There you have it.  A day in the life.  Well, a better day in the life.

       "thanks giovanna!! your the best!!"   Maria, I believe that you intended to say: Thanks, Giovanna!  You're the best!" The manner in which you spelled the word "your/you're" indicated that you were using it as a possessive, as in, "Giovanna, can you bring some more of  your  homemade cookies to lunch tomorrow?" "You're", on the other hand, is a contraction, joining the words "you" and "are". Thanks for allowing me to let off steam!

      FURTHER, the reason you should do my research for me is because you are blessed with high-speed Internet, while here I sit, brokenhearted, came to dump, but only farted....WHOOPS!  Wrong show for the wrong audience....But yeah, here I sit, brokenhearted, with an idiotic dial-up service, which, for your information, has a speed of 49.2 Kbps.  So, I spend, like, 10 minutes waiting to post anything.

      OK, several things to say: 1) Our unintentional palm tree (I promised to say more about it) happened when my uncle came to visit from--that's right--ENGLAND!  We bought a coconut (don't ask me why, I was, like, 4 years old), but never ate it.  It eventually went frot (yes, it IS a word--South African) and we chucked it into the front garden.  And, well, wha'dya know, a palm tree grew!  TADA!  2) I think a black hole exploded and blew up another star.  Could someone please find out?  I just saw a headline.  3) Will be posted later, seeing as I am being called by my parental units to clear the table, unload, and then reload te dishwasher.  Then, I suppose I better get a move on Soto's homework.  Plus Sands's, Pereira's, Szmulewicz's, Izquierdo's and Buitragos's.  Ali, what exactly  was  Pereira's homework?

      At Tony Chan's in downtown Miami.  It was in the soup and in my noodles.  My sister is allergic and could never eat anything with MSG but I never had a problem.  I think there was a LOT of it in the food.

      Ah, Emy.  You see, we had no identifiable plants--and still don't other than an unplanned palm tree (it was an accident--more on that later) and various potted African Violets.  And dead Basil. So, snails are evidently not a problem.  As to your MSG reactioin, where'd you get it?  My daddy is allergic to MSG.  We order all our Chinese food with no MSG, and he can't even eat Sour-Cream-And-Cheddar Chip, which are one of my fovorites.  What a shame, there's more for me!!

      I loved snails when I was little.  I would collect them (Emily, your not the only special one) and hold them and poke their antennas.  That was the cool part.  They would retract into their heads!    I got an MSG reaction.  It feels like your temples are being squished.

       "Gio, you had a pet snail?! That is indeed deeply cool, especialy with such a name as Robert. Robert and the snails. How's that for a band name? Why for only one day, though? Did your mum decide that Robert was a bad influence on you? You know, when I was little, I used to collect snails...."   I decided to let him go because I felt it was cruel to keep him confined to a plastic jar with holes punched out on the lid. And I don't think my parents fully understand the term "bad influence."   On to the grammatical issues at hand. Emily, you're going to have to surrender to the so-called "abbreviations" and misspellings. In this age, the growing standard is whatever you can vaguely comprehend. But comprehend nonetheless. Don't pretend that you can't register what they're writing, because your ability to correct them is a dead-on obvious indicator. And being able to type properly shouldn't automatically associated with intellectual discussion or vise versa. Besides, it's futile to argue over such a thing.

      After updating (that's right Erik--updating, not ^^^dating) myself upon this blog, I have come to a mature decision.  I will not blow up at Caitlin for misspelling "hypocrite".  Instead, I will pity her....and her apparent lack of knowledge about the English language. Hmph. Easier said than done. P.S. Caitlin, you also misspelled "limestone". P.P.S. Gio, you had a pet snail?!  That is indeed deeply cool, especialy with such a name as Robert.  Robert and the snails.  How's that for a band name?  Why for only one day, though?  Did your mum decide that Robert was a bad influence on you?  You know, when I was little, I used to  collect  snails....

      *waits silently until Emily blows up and yells at Caitlin for misspelling hypocrite*  No, I've never had a pet rock, although I did have a pet snail for a day. His name was Robert.   Too bad all of the empty lots around here are full of limestone. Hmm... limestone is pretty particular to the southern Floridian ecosystem. That could make for an interesting explanation, albeit common. Half the class will probably bring limestone. :\

      Very well, Maria.  I will tell you what I know about the rock project.  However, may I urge you, for the sake of your self-esteem, you may want to capitalize your "I"s.  Anyway, my backyard isn't any good for rocks either.  I'm trying to let my dad let me use this rock we found on the beach in Martha's Vineyard.  It's gray, and has a tiny white stripe running all around it, and it's a very neat shape.   For you, you could take a walk in your neighborhood.  If there are any vacant lots, they could be of help.  Or, snoop in a nasty neighbor's yard, and steal one of theirs! =P

      Erik.  I will   never   stop having my fit. OK.  Erik.  When you write "^^^date", you are in fact spending more effort (gasp--punching those bloody buttons) than simply writing the word "update".  I presume that you take such measures to abbreviate, and therefore lessen the effort of pushing the pathetic buttons.   Okay, Usual Suspects (and you know who you are)!  Who votes that we ignore anything this buffoon says, unless he says it in normal, unabbreviated, un-buffoonish language? All in favor say "Yay!". All opposed, don't say anything.

      Jello is Jello because I am refering to Jello Biafra. Em, if you were truly attempting to be British, instead of saying "nuts" you would have said looney. Now that's the proper way of doing things. And, in your other post a few days ago, instead of honor, you would have spelled it honour. And what British influence? You mean watching Scottish soap operas?   "No stranger to free-speech battles himself, Biafra was first thrust into the role of anticensorship crusader in 1986.   That year, Biafra and four others were charged in Los Angeles with one count each of distributing harmful matter to minors for the band's 1985 release of Frankenchrist. It was the first recorded work in American history to be tried for obscenity.   The case went to trial and in August, 1987, the jury deadlocked, and the charges were dropped. Although Frankenchrist was declared not obscene, the album, as well as Biafra's other recordings and works by his label Alternative Tentacles, were banned from chain stores across the country.   Biafra began his vocal crusade against censorship and became an advocate for freedom of artistic expression in all media, delivering his spoken-word performances on the college lecture circuit and promoting his anticensorship ideas on national television.   In the mid 1980s, he openly clashed with Tipper Gore, then-leader of the Parents Music Resource Center, the group responsible for placing warning labels on recorded works. He has also taken on Pat Buchanan, Oprah Winfrey, and activists from the religious right.   He ran for mayor of San Francisco in 1979, finishing fourth out of 10 candidates, and made an unsuccessful run to win the Green Party's nomination in the year 2000 presidential race."

      Ah, Giovanna..... There would be a  reason   that there is no period after "Mrs".  Reason being: THAT'S HOW THE BRITS DO IT!!!  TADA!!  And, Gio?  Tipper Gore?  Zappa?  Jell-O?  (That would be the way it is properly spelt--yes, spelt, not spelled--once again, the British influence.)  But Gio?  Sometimes I  do   seriously worry about your mental health.  You are like a peanut M&M.  Sweet on the outside, going nuts underneath.  Oh, vomit.  That sounded so sappy and cutesy-wutesy and pathetic and sick.

      And I thought that I was the grammar police...  Erik, if you want to make a blog of your own just see the upper-right hand corner of the editing screen. After "Mrs Soto's Earth Science Class Blog" (EMILY! WE'VE CAUGHT YOU! No period after Mrs.! THE HORROR!) you will see an arrow. Click on it. Scroll down until you see "Create a New Blog". Proceed to click on that. Now follow their directions. Blogs are quite fun. I have one of my own. So do Caitlin and Emily.

      Erik, in response to your question about the rocks, (which, by the way, I really shouldn't be answering seeing as the way you typed it was absolutely deplorable), I am not quite sure.  Perhaps if Mrs Soto were to join, she could tell us.

      OK.  Some of youse guys (yes, youse  is  a word), as in certain folks, as in you, have some severe misconceptions about this blog.  First off, this is not like AIM or msn instant messanger, or whatever it is you may use.  You post whatever you have to say, (and by what you have to say, I mean something of substance.....or something like it....) on the site.   Then, just like Julius Caesar, others will come, will see, will respond, and conquer your views.   And, please, people, try to write in proper English.  No "u" for "you".  No "4" for "for".  No "2" for "to" or "too".  "2" for "two" is, however, permissible, as is "4" for "four". This, being a forum for intellectual discussion, must be just that.  Once again, "plz", "xplain", "ppl" and "b" for "be" will not be tolerated. And I, being an administrator, have full rights to edit, censor, and even delete posts.   Come on people, it's amazing how little effort is needed for expressing yourself these days.  No lengthy writing-out of verse or speech-preparing....no.  All that you have to do is poke out little buttons on a loser keyboard.  So, come on folks, you can do it!   Do we need more pep talks?  Or threats?  Let me know, in readable, English please.

      You most certainly may   NOT    be Emily K as well.  Furthermore, for your information, the phrase "as well" is comprised of two words, not one.  And even  further  more, no you may not become an administrator.  So there.

You know, Mrs Soto still hasn't joined.  Maybe she just observes this with amusement rather than lower herself to post something.

      Hey Caitlin, Em, Emily, Ali, and Ms. Soto:  Responses to:  -astronomy: A truly fascinating subject, especially when it collides with physics.  -chocolate minerals: There is no way that anything that involves chocolate could be bad.  -labs: My favorite aspect of science, particularly when it involves pipets, DNA, test tubes, radiation and assorted bases and polymers. (Summer was too great). -next year's required science projects: Something I'm worried about as I can't seem to come up with a good topic.   Emily, can I play around with the links? We could link to Soto's SchoolNotes page, Space.com, our school's site, etc.

      Ahem, an article has now confirmed it folks.....   Homework fails to make the grade     Mark Townsend Sunday February 8, 2004 The Observer    Children have long suspected it, and now research confirms it: homework is a waste of time. Anxiety, boredom, fatigue and emotional exhaustion are all side-effects of bringing schoolwork home, according to a review of 75 years of study into the issue.   Even those who believe homework improves their performance in the classroom resent the encroachment on their spare time.   And the best place for extra study may not, in fact, be at home. The report by the Institute of Education makes a case for out-of-hours study to be done in after-school learning clubs, away from the potentially disruptive influence of parents.   Tensions are the most pronounced in middle-class families where the pressure to succeed can create a volatile atmosphere. Parents who are overbearing can undermine any pleasure children derive from study.   The report's author, Dr Susan Hallam, said: 'Parents have the most positive influence when they offer moral support, make appropriate resources available and discuss general issues. They should only actually help with homework when their children specifically ask them to.'   Current government guidance ranges from at least one hour a week of homework for five-to seven-year-olds to two-and-a-half hours a day for students aged 14 to 16. Yet Hallam found that homework tended to boost achievement only when done in moderate amounts.   Her findings follow comments from David Bell, chief inspector of schools, who said that parents have a key role to play in tackling an endemic anti-learning culture in society.   'Early support from parents is crucial. A very significant investment in the early years has got to be right, even though we are still not 100 per cent sure what the biggest single influence is in these years,' he said.

      No, I am/was not planning on going to South Africa over Spring Break.  It would have been stupid; as soon as I would get adjusted, I would have to leave.  As it happens, my uncle from SA, as well as one from Cleveland (but he doesn't count), had a conference in Atlanta, so he decided to make a trip out of it.  He came to Miami a few days before said conference with his younger daughter Isabel, (the older one is coming in June for my bat mitzvah), who stayed with us for about a week.  Then, they will go to Boston, where some other cousins live, and spend some time with them.  My dad is hammering for the computer, and for me to clear the table, so I must get off.

      Oh well.  This is becoming more and more social, and will continue to do so until her Majesty Madame Soto gives us some topics.  Or maybe it was doomed from the start.

As to Spring Break, my cousin Isabel (9 years) flew in from South Africa, with her father, my uncle Steve aka Groovy Steve (many more years).  Also, some relatives from Ohio.  These would be: uncle David, Aunt Erika (breast-cancer survivor, artist, very cool person all around) and their kids, Justin (11 years, pretty neat, is also a pyro), and Marguerite (6 years, and terribly annoying).

      No duh you know Tom, Rick. And no, even as an administrator, I cannot see people's nicknames, only their full names.  Anyway, I believe it may be returning to normal....however, Rick shall be bound and tied and slowly turned on a spit as he is boiled over an eternal pot of a sickening mixture of simmering parsnips and Brussels sprouts.  That is indeed a suitable punishment.  I am reading  1984  by George Orwell.  Effing amazing book.  Yes, effing.  Anybody over the age of six knows the eff-word, however, I shall refrain from using it on a school blog.  The point is, everybody should read it.

      Em, as administrator cant you see everyone's username?  Check it out.  I doubt it is a hacker.  Also, if you change your blogging name, don't all of your previous posts change the name aswell?  How could it be Rick if it does that?

      What is wrong with this thing?  I first look at the blog and all I see are Rick's entries and "Bob's" entries.  I hit "Refresh".  Nothing doing. Then, I post a frantic post and I hit "Refresh" again.  And miracle of miracles, everything appears back to normal, and all of "Bob's" entries have slipped off the face of the bloody planet!  Now, what exactly is going on?  Do we have a bug?  A glitch?  A virus?  Or...dare I suggest it? : P... ...might we have hackers on our tails?  That's right folks...(cornily DRAMATIC male television commercial voice) DUNH DUNH DUNH...those who you interact with every single day...friends by day, hackers by night.... : P, whatever.   I must admit that I am not too certain of all the inner workings of the Internet...BUT.... Oh yes, Rick, sorry for accusing you in my other post, but if you or ANY ONE ELSE IS in fact messing about on this blog....you, sir/madame, are in a large load of compost. In other words, a whole lot of poo in a hole.

      Hello all for this day this week at this time I blog. Emily in your opinion why do you believe that this blog is "embarrassing" don't all blogs look like this, I am just wondering. Also I think I know why on Marias computer the blog appeared to be messed up and I know the solution but will I tell you I don't know why but I wont.

I am now going out to dinner with a friend that I haven't seen for about two years...she lives in Boston.  Named Arielle.

      "A moon full of stars and astral cars," is from "Pyramid Song" by Radiohead. It's quite a lovely piano track with nice ondes martenot courtesy of Jonny Greenwood. Death Cab for Cutie is a great name based on how it just rolls off the tongue. My favorite band names are Sonic Youth (I decided this before I even began to adore them), Radiohead (it's after this awesome Talking Heads song that most people hate), Theoretical Girls, Stereolab, Talking Heads, Half Man Half Biscuit, Joy Division, Fugazi, etc. I always thought Chien Andalusia was a film by Dali but I suppose I was wrong. I've seen the bit where they slice open the eyeballs, it's really neat and gut churning.

      Yes, the planets were indeed amazing.  It was so satisfying to see Ganymede, where my imaginary colony is.  And you could even see the stripes on Jupiter. But by far, the most amazing thing was Saturn.  It looked just so amazingly perfectly spherical.  And the rings were just, just, just.....just amazing.  It really just looked so perfect it was almost unreal.  Oh yes, Mrs Soto, this astronomer guy who was showing us all this, he wouold be, like, your ideal person.  He was a jeweler, so he was all into minerals and gems and rocks and stuff; and, he was a completely passionate astronomer.  He was indeed a very neat person.  He also had this awesome laser pointer (green light rather than red, which makes all the difference), that looked just as though it was pointing exactly onto the stars themselves, like actually touching the sky (I know, I know, the sky is not a solid, so you cannot very well "touch" it, it's just a load of gas, whatever.  **I am blowing a raspberry at that fact because it is stupid.**)  And Giovanna, I will also quote the Pixies.  Ahem, "Debaser":    Got me a movie   Ha ha ha hoa   Slicing up eyeballs   Ha ha ha hoa   Girlie so groovy   Ha ha ha hoa   Don't know about you   But I am un chien Andalusia    I am un chien Andalusia (x3)    Wanna grow   Up to be    Be a debaser.  Etceterea, etcetera...  So there.  This site says: Based on French surrealistic film "Un Chien Andalou" (An Andalusian Dog), by Spanish director Luis Bunuel (1928). The film starts with the scene in which an eyeball is being cut open.  Nice, eh?  And now that song ended, and I am listening to "Black Star" by Radiohead.  Ooh...and  coming up next is "Title and Registration" by Death Cab for Cutie.  Is that not the coolest band name ever??  OK, so it's not, but it's pretty close.  Giode, what song says "full of stars and astral cars"?  That sounds very neat indeed.  The Pixies again, perhaps?  Anyway.  I get seasick. Badly. Unpleasant. **Another raspberry.  Or perhaps a load of vomit.  Take your pick.**  Anyway, I'm just rambling now.

      Camping was great.  Snorkeling:  "Animals were hiding behind the rock Except the little fish But they told me, he swears Tryin' to talk to me to me to me," (Sorry, the yearning to quote the Pixies proved to be too much). I saw a sky "full of stars and astral cars," (Sorry, impulses again). The sky was brilliant. Just an aMAzing amount of stars. I saw Saturn, Jupiter and its Gallilean moons through a telescope. They look quite like the photographs.

      I'm just curious, does dust decompose? It has to, right? The reason I ask this is because I just cleaned out my room, and there is dust everywhere. It must have been there for about 10 years at least. If dust does decompose, how long does it take?

      Sorry, Allison, I DID try to stop myself, but I couldn't, so I will give you only a minor chewing-out.  Sorry. Ahem: the word "away" is one word and "sense" is spelled like so.  I'm really sorry.  I'm trying to learn to disregard.  But, it's like in  Fahrenheit 451 , philosophies, languages dropped, English and spelling slowly ignored and then completely neglected......

      I will make a mental note to from now on say FANBLOODYTASTIC as opposed to fan-bloody-tastic. Thank you for the lesson em. (Notice I spelled em with a lowercase e). What's wrong with the letter E anyways? It dosn't do you any harm. The fly on the other hand.... Hey it's a science experiment.   If you havn't noticed I'm just blabbling a way and I'm not sure if that last paragraph made any sence at all whatsoever. Please don't give me a grammar or spelling lesson, I'm really not in the mood.

      Right then, update on Señor Fly-in-shower.   OK, well, he hasn't really changed much.  In fact, he remains in his prune-with-wings stage.  He isn't all that bad really........ GOD!  The things I do to convince myself that I don't have to clean it up.  Because the idea of going and removing him from his position of being wedged in the screen is jolly sick, is it not? So, if anyone feels like earning a knighthood (which shall consist of tea, fancy South African Red Label Lemon Cremes--I know, I know, that meant nothing to any of youse--biltong, and a sticker!), come on round and handle it,  si vou ples .  I know, I know, I absolutely did not spell that correctly--So sue me--I'm not in  le programme of le Frenchies .  If someone feels like it, corerect me.

      Allison: you really musn't bohter with the hyphens, it ruins the entire fullness, roundness, of the word.  FANBLOODYTASTIC!  When written like this, it makes the reader hunt about, trying to find the word.  The hyphens really rather staccato-iffy it.  Don't you agree? Yes, England is by all means fanbloodytastic, and so is Giovanna's editorial. Also, I do believe that I will NOT, in fact, do this essay.  Not bloody worth it.  If anybody else feels like picking it up, they're more than welcome to, but I am doubting it extremely. I LOVE THIS BLOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Excessive use of punctuation [exclamation points] shows extreme love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      This blog seems to be petering out.  Is it safe to presume that the majority of the population has better things to do than diggin their pathetic nose and poking on the loser keyboard to post on an idiot blog?

      Rick.  It is REALLY BLOODY difficult to read posts in which there is ZERO punctuation.  Commas help, but periods, man, are like the greatest thing since Swiss cheese.  They REALLY help when the time comes to decipher what you are trying to say.  I am trying to leave the grammar thing to "anything-that-can-be-basically-comprehended" but it is really bloody hard to separate out the sentences.  As to your idea of having people run when I approach, we could work with this, man.  I could use them as numchucks, or a lasso, or uproot houses with them, or strangle people....I REALLY like the direction in which this is headed....

      I didn't mean to. I was just being a neurotic freak. I'm rather good at that.   School of Rock was great! OH MY GOD IT'S JIM O'ROURKE! And "Led Zeppelin, Gods of rock..." And, "Hey, KURT COBAIN! Show us your song!" And the fact that this dude was lecturing them on the Ramones, Iggy Pop, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. I think I started jumping up and down duting that scene and squealing "THE RAMONES! IGGY POP! KURT COBAIN!" and George just sighed and left the room, inevitably thinking, "when will she stop getting over-excited at that band's very mention?" Good stuff. And the "Immigrant Song" sing a-long. What a hilarious film.  I'm doing my sonnet right now. It's very surreal and idealistic.  And as an ironic twist, I'm jumping about the room to "Electioneering".

      Let's see if we can come up with another.  Hmmm.... I dunno.  Horse's uterus and pig rectum were pretty hard to beat, though I must credit pig rectum to  School of Rock . Hmmmmm... A llama's saliva gland? That should make Emily Northrop happy.  And, no, Gio, thou art not a jerk. I simply was shocked and appalled at having my brilliant, glorious little moment in the sun bursted.  Oh well.  It may as well have been then than later. :)!  Oh yes, you lot had to do that weird sonnet for L.A., right? Well, mine sort of turned into Columbine.  Not quite sure how that happened...

      Any intended insult that isn't relevant to the actual fault at hand is generic, no matter how obscure it is. I was describing the tactics of those who usually call people horse uteruses (that sounds incorrect). And you can thank Axl Rose for the poking a finger in someone's face aggressively thing. Axl Rose is the mysogynistic and homophobic lead singer of Guns and Roses, who are horrible and were the world's premier hair metal band of the eighties.   I have no idea which song you're talking about. Give me a line or something.

      I'm with Rick on this one...  For once, I agree with Rick......This blog is HIGHLY AMUSING, and, although it really has not ever served its intended purpose, it's been a hell of a lot of fun.   Rick: be forewarned. I am planning my tactics on poking my finger at you in an aggressive manner.   We should most certainly keep this going over the summer, but none of that "hey-everybody-how-is-your-summer-vacation-going?" garbage.   Ja?

      Well, well, well.  I would most certainly NOT call "horse's uterus" and "pig rectum" generic insults.  A generic insult would be "the motherf***ing son of a....".  I didn't do that, nor did I threaten his mother, nothing is  her   fault...that's another thing I don't understand.  When someone calls someone else a "son of a .....", they are insulting his mother, rather than whomever they are talking to.  Poking my finger at him in an aggressive manner, however, is something that I have not yet considered.  The funny little corners of your brain never cease to amaze me.  It is a truly briliant idea.  And no, insulting won't get me anywhere, but it IS a hell of a fun.  Further, I am not an adult, and although I am conscious (if I were  un conscious, I would be lying on the floor, blacked out), I WOULD like to know what  Hi am a trader too he he. See you on monday  would mean.  The second sentence I follow, but not the first.    Oh yes, Giovanna?  What is Track 13 on the mix CD you gave me?

      I just felt that your automatic reaction to Rick's actions was just too predictable, and of the "I'm a huge sports fan and the referee just made a bad call, and I've decided to throw generic insults at him, threaten his mother, and poke my finger at him in an aggressive manner," variety. It's not such a big deal, and insulting people won't get you anywhere. I thought that this was required learning for all conscious adults, but hey, we know I'm wrong.

And here we are talking about HTML's, Bloody toes, Hair Cuts, Rock Bands, This Dude Named Tom, Horses' Uterus' (that;s a good one), Dissecting Flies... I don't want to go to far back. Its not like theres anything wrong with that, But I guess its just a "social" blog til Madame Soto shows up. Get real though! Mrs. sOTO HAS TOO MUCH OF A LIFE to care about this!

      Yes, it does indeed suck that Spring Break is almost over.  It has been immensely enjoyable to be free of homework, to go to the beach with my friends.  And Isabela, it really ISN'T all that funny....although I suppose my view is rather biased since I wrote quite a lot of it.  Oh yes, a little while ago, I tripped and hit my foot on a chair so badly, I went flying.  Literally.  Everything I was holding flew out of my hands, and my glasses off my face.  Half my toes have swollen to at least twice their normal size, are bright red, and are bloody throbbing!  I can't even walk properly, I sort of shuffle along.  Oh yes, these past few days I've been at the beach, and have taken care not to get sunburned.  However, I still freckle.  And I discovered that my arms have freckeled enormously, except, where my urf top sleeves have been.  So, it's like a tan line, but a freckle line.  And the only place I got burned was the back of my knees, which is unpleasant indeed.   And upon proofreading this, I have found that every paragraph begins with "yes" or "oh yes".  I suppose that I am being optimistic today.

      You do realize that while Mrs. Soto may not be a member of this blog, she can still read it. It seems a bit illogical to post a rough draft of a letter you're going to send an individual in a forum they can, and possibly read.

      I have just re-invited Mrs Soto and Donna for the bazillionth time.  Maybe it's an AOL problem?  Buuuuttttt....the point is, if Soto gets the invite, and joins, I will have to remove and/or censor many of my posts.  Hmph.  This really is NOT a science blog, but just a bunch of kids fooling around.  I like it; I really really do.

What is our thing with them, rick? i am having issues. i do not want to take that stupid bloody vocab. test in humanidades. Rick and Eimily N., agree and say that buitrago is stupid. htta will mke me ffeel a lot better. well i don't really think it will be hard, but even if it is the easiest thing in the world i have a tendency to fail when it comes to humanities. ok i will go study now.

      Defensive?  Moi?  Are you talking about this blog?  Or about my own?  As to this one I did the same thing you did: post my post in the title.  My question was: "What is your thing with my suspenders anyway?"  Y'know, maybe you ought to get a pair, and go on a honeymoon of sorts with them.  That's what I did with mine: I wore them every day for about a week and a half.  Then I lessened, and now on just about every odd day I wear them.  Except today I wore a belt instead.  Onward.  YOU calling ME "child"????  I beg your pardon.  I am a full 6 months and 1 day older than you are, childling, and if anything, I ought to be calling you so, not you me.  And yes, that IS  a proper sentence.  So there.  =)

I learned the Hebrew word for suspenders: shleikes. It is actually Yiddish, because there is no word in Hebrew for suspenders. Are you happy Rick?  And yes, let's all get our torches and pitchforks and run Szmulewicz out of town!  Who's with me?  Actuaslly, I know exactly who's with me.  Rick's with me.  From the Algebra class, Gio is shaking her head in surrendered annoyance, and Emily secretly wants to do so, but it's violent so she won't.  Wow, we're the only 4 in both Algebra and Earth Science; at least in the Spanish program.  Only the ones who have Szmulewicz do any work; I was talking to Maria (German Algebra) she says that they're still on linear equations and the teacher doesn't like graphs so she doesn't make them do them; lucky poopheads.

       anyway, i just woke up at 10:30 and my father asked me if i had stayed up late last night and i had, but i couldn't remember what i had been doing. it took a while to realized that i had been reading Shabanu and listening to music and responding to e-mail and blogging.    I couldn't sleep either. I think I was blogging last night.   but that isn't really important. what is important is the fact that tomorrow is our drama rehearsal until 7:30 and i do not know when i will manage to do my homework. but wait! what homework do i have anyway? humanities. that won't take that long and i can probably manage to do it in homeroom. do we have science homework? no don't answer i'm sure we have loads. damndamndamn.    I am uberdead because of the homework situation. I'm supposed to be visiting with relatives today, yet I am doing Algebra homework. Tuesday and Wednesday, I'm off to see the drama production... oh well, I don't have to sleep this week.   wow this post was so totally stupid and poitless. i must be more bored than i thought. i shall go make a Sunday Morning Playlist   I shall too. It will be a Sunday Morning and I'm doing homework playlist. Okay, "Sunday Morning", "Sunday", "Disconnection Notice", all the  OK Computer  b-sides...

      Homework fails to make the grade   Mark Townsend Sunday February 8, 2004 The Observer   Children have long suspected it, and now research confirms it: homework is a waste of time. Anxiety, boredom, fatigue and emotional exhaustion are all side-effects of bringing schoolwork home, according to a review of 75 years of study into the issue.   Even those who believe homework improves their performance in the classroom resent the encroachment on their spare time.   And the best place for extra study may not, in fact, be at home. The report by the Institute of Education makes a case for out-of-hours study to be done in after-school learning clubs, away from the potentially disruptive influence of parents.   Tensions are the most pronounced in middle-class families where the pressure to succeed can create a volatile atmosphere. Parents who are overbearing can undermine any pleasure children derive from study.   The report's author, Dr Susan Hallam, said: 'Parents have the most positive influence when they offer moral support, make appropriate resources available and discuss general issues. They should only actually help with homework when their children specifically ask them to.'   Current government guidance ranges from at least one hour a week of homework for five-to seven-year-olds to two-and-a-half hours a day for students aged 14 to 16. Yet Hallam found that homework tended to boost achievement only when done in moderate amounts.   Her findings follow comments from David Bell, chief inspector of schools, who said that parents have a key role to play in tackling an endemic anti-learning culture in society.   'Early support from parents is crucial. A very significant investment in the early years has got to be right, even though we are still not 100 per cent sure what the biggest single influence is in these years,' he said.

      Congrats.  What essay?  Like, what was the topic and junk?  Also, define "one of the winners".  Does that mean 1st place, 2nd place...?  Could you maybe post your essay?  You know, as I was putting away some laundry I saw my suspenders lying in my socks drawer, and they looked so inspiring, but I can't wear them tomorrow; I must look dignified and somewhat normal because I am delivering the evil little 5th graders to their homerooms.  I feel like the stork.  Watch some 6th grader ask:   Mommy, where do 5th graders come from?   Mother: From the stork, dear. Me: Hahahahahaha.  Man, that made no sense.  I still haven't done Szmulewicz's slave labor for 9.2, so off I go.

      This blog is just so much sheer fun...and yes...lmao.  I know, I know, I abbreviated, simply because this is a class blog...oh screw it...LAUGHING MY ASS OFF TO THE FLIPPIN  MOON , MAN!  THIS IS GREAT BEYOND BLOODY GREAT!    You said " It was just a little joke no need to pant about it your suspenders may rip becareful. Lmao. "  Well.  I say: It was jus a little joke; no need to get your panties in a twist, be careful.  NYAHAHAHA!  Man, I crack myself up.  While on the topic of panties, Mr Sands today said that he would invest in "What do you call them?  Those things that women pull up??? Uummm...PANTYHOSE, That's them.  Yeah, pantyhose.  Because women are always wearing them, and they're always gettin holes...yeah, if I were an investor, I'da invest in pantyhose."  Who has Sands?  And, random, but extremely interesting link, about the removal of first-amendment rights from teenage students in order to protect Mr Bush's "dignity":  urlLink here .

Here it is, all 5 bazillion: Section 9.1 #24-76 (second column)            Finish 9.1 Classwork Section 9.2 #11-51 (second column), 53, 58-60             Finish 9.2 Classwork (#10-50, 1st column)

      ok emily, 1st of all matrix revolutions is the 3rd movie not the 2nd  1) the oracle was black in the 1st and 2nd movies, she just had lighter skin and they had 2 switch actors in the 3rd movie because the lady who played the oracle died.   2) Well since the whole thing is just a computer programm, so is the oracle, and the agents are technically a program that has become a virus and is spreading itself around by turning all other programs into agents.   hope that helps and im so bloody bored that i'll answer any questions rite now

      Rick: I can certainly see why your mother would throw you outside.  Although if I were her, I wouldn't consider the food part to be necessary.  =).  Um, let's see.  When my dad was little, his family would go over to his grandparents' house for Sunday lunch.  He and his brother would be locked out of the house with a bottle of juice.  His sister was allowed to stay in.  SHE never went into the grandfather's darkening room with a flashlight, or opened the door to the darkening room wide open, or try and pick the locks of his room where grandfather kept his stuff or broke antiques...my father was a terrible child.  Anyway, last night I started watching  The Matrix: Revolutions  which is number 2.  I stopped it when Trinity gets spiked by those things in the ship (Neo's been blinded, and it looks like she's gonna die).  I'm a-gonna continue it tonight.  It's such a nightish movie.  But I've got some questions in the event that anyone here has seen it/understands it.  And one more thing: this is much less intellectual than the first one, this is just one fight scene after another.  And it baffles me that in such a society, the only way to settle differences is through violence--wwe fight until one dies.  But here are the questions:  1. Why is the Oracle black?  She was white in the first... 2. What does the Oracle turn into when the Agents do that thing to her?   I'll probably ask more as I watch the rest.  Anyway.  Right now the guy who will film my bat mitzvah is here.  We are talking to him.  The other day we were arranging the food.  WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MAKE-YOUR-OWN-SUNDAE BAR!!!!!!  WOOFUCKINGHOO!!!!

      I've got my own blog to play with.  If anyone cares, they can read that.  And I like to think of my profile as rather amusing too.  Surefolks could post day-to-day events.  We could also do current political happenings, scientific discoverires, and ethics (i.e. cloning: evil or helpful).  This blog could be a form for hot debate!  I'll be working with 2-year-olds, so maybe I'll ask them how babies are made, or somehting funny.    Really, the only people on this blog are the Usual Suspects and Rick, with occasional visits from Maria.  Erik had a temporary fling, but I reckon there ain't gonna be no more folks on this-here blogoferous.  So...whatever.  Go crazy.  Help yourself.  P.S. I was channel-flipping this morning and I came across a Christian channl show.  It was like "Jesus knocks at your heart which is your house and if you open up, he'll come inside and Jesus will be in your heart which is your house and so don't be mean, but read the Bible everyday and don't crap in your neighbor's mailbox and don't try and copulate with you dooooggg...."....  It was unbelievably funny.

      i told her, "Mrs. Sot, I'll think of you when I'm adopting." they should definitely show that in high schools as an abstinence class type of thing. it was very frightening. having kids seems like way more trouble than it's worth.   oh yes, maria, you are so optimistic.

      Isabela.  When you were like talking about the birth of a baby, then all of of sudden say you're going to Virginia, I thought you said you were going to Vagina.  I am pathetic.  It's all Soto's fault.  She did all that stuff.  Ew.  I went to see Ms Pou today.  She said it was difficult to teach that while she was pregnant.  She just had another daughter.  I'm bored.

      Little Ricky's going outside to play.  How amusing.  Caitlin, your posts on the GS blog are pure gold!     But yeah.  Holy Goddamn F%#@.  Tomorrow's the last day of school.  It feel so surreal.  I mean, where the hell has the time gone???  Time moves man, and it ain't going slower.  God.  It's scary.  We're all going to get old.  And get sick.  And die.  And the time will go faster and faster and faster.  And honey, your life will be GONE!  Jesus Christ.  Remember how looong it would take in preschool and first grade for things to happen, for days to pass?  How early we would wake up, bright and energized and wanting to play?  Good heavens alive man, I never wake up happy.  I never even wake up ALIVE.  And it is beyond sad that we are spending the years in which according to primordial law, we are supposed learn about ourselves, and become adults.  But instead, we are living our days doing things we hate, taking orders from people we hate.  I am willing to bet that every songle person in our science class is able to function as an adult of this "society".  And, dude, today's adults are nore babies than we are.  And by the time you hit 70, you start regressing.  You become a baby again.  That's not the way it's meant to be.  But.  Life's a shit. What are you going to do?  So there's my emotional philosophy end-of-the-year.  Aka PMS.  or something.    But yeah.    Fuck the soundcheck.

      It tends to be helpful to your readers to speak in complete sentences not in Squanto, i.e. Me Caitlin.  It gone over no more.    What is gone?  Regardless of how many extra points you get for saying "bloody hell".    You know, the Google related searches at this moment are: nasal polyps and pork tenderloin.  It'll probably change after I post this, bt I thought that was pretty damn funny.  Nasal polyps and pork tenderloins.  Hard to see the realation to each other, let alone that to what we have to say.  Would all the "bloody"s account for the pork tenderloins, perhaps?

      SZMULEWICZ IS AN UNBLOODYREASONABLE PAIN IN THE ARSE!!!!!  [To be read slowly and deliberately, enunciating each word as though speaking with a stubborn 3-year-old.]  THe Algebra homework, assigned by our own dear Mrs Szmulewicz, is as follows: Finish Classwork (10.8 # 15-49 odd)--FOR A FLIPPIN' GRADE!!!          Homework: 10.8 #62-63          STUDY FOR A FLIPPIN' QUIZ!!!!  [TO BE READ FANATICALLY]  WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!! WATCH--JUST  WATCH --HER ASSIGN HOMEWORK DUE WEDNESDAY!!!!  WATCH HER DO IT!!!!  AND THEN, YOU CAN WATCH ME THROW ROCKS THROUGH HER GODDAMN WINDOWS, AND FORCE HER TO BE UP THROUGH THE A.M. HOURS DOING FUCKING CRAP LIKE THIS!!!!! AND AFTER THAT, YOU CAN STAY FOR AN HOUR OF ME THROWING FLAMING BOG ROLLS AT HER!!!  OK FOLKS, WHO'S WITH ME???  STAY TUNED FOR MORE VOODOO TORTURE.

      my question.  Which is: what are we thinking of Soto's explicitness?  Have we honestly learned anything?  I did: sperm look like tadpoles.  I know someone whose parents practically keep her in a bubble, and she actually learns what they want her to learn when they want her to learn it.

      Hello Maria.  Good to see you've rejoined us.  I'm with Rick, you're still young!  How tall are your folks?  Grandparents??  Siblings??  And dude...your doctor gives you growth hormones???  -shrinks away in various emotional states-  Oh yes, this really should go on my own blog but I am too lazy to bother to do so: I was meeting with the rabbi, and he hates the terms "battie" and "barmie" for bat and bar mitzvah.  I was also saying how I hadn't been on the Internet for a while.  He wasn't really listening, and then I say "withdrawal symptoms", and he snaps to attention in genuine concern.  Rabbi ain't my favorite person, he's rather boring.  Hey Rick, I was lying in bed, being unable to sleep, thinking of random memories when one of earlier this year pops up: you calling my pants gay, then me calling you gay.  Damn, we really hated each other, didn't we?  Hohoho.  What are we thinking of Soto's explicitness?  Rather terrifying.  I was very surprised to learn that sperm look like tadpoles.  I think that's hilarious.  Another thing: Y-Sperm travel faster, but they are also less hardy, they die faster.  X-Sperm are the slow-and-steady, stronger dudes (dudettes!).

      6 is an even # divisible by 1 2 3 and 6, the difference b/w 1 and 2 is 1 the difference bw 2 and 3 is 1 and the difference bw 3 and 6 is 3, add 1 and 1, multiply it by 3 and ur answer is 6. im just blabbering nonsense to avoid my study guides. 6 is also 4 away from 10 which gives u 1 2 3 4 6 and 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5, 4 and 3 is 7 4 squared is 16, divided by 2 is 8, 8 plus 10 is 18 divided by 2 is 9. the result? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

      Erik- just because Mrs. Soto hasn't joined you have no idea whether she still reads the blog or not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food for your&nbsp; thoughts  Emmy-&nbsp; It tis most amusing when you refer to "my kids"&nbsp;  Stormbreaker is very awesome while Shakespeare Stealer is not.&nbsp; How was your trip Maria?&nbsp;  About the Matrix, I need to have another sleep over with the    US    and have it explained to me all over again.&nbsp; Maybe we could have a marathon and watch all of them.&nbsp; OOOOOOHHHHHH!!!&nbsp; What a great idea.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      South park is a political funny show. They make jokes about EVERYTHING. Micheal Jackson, gays, jews, all religions, wars, presidents, politics, rumors. . . Ya get the idea. South park is hillarious and can easily be a topic of conversation in a well - conversation. And this is gonna tik ya off but its being nominated 4 an emmy.     My latest question- can ya swallow wax 4 ur braces?(hell yes i just ignored ya(4))    So i do indeed find it weird u think the oracle was a jew. Next u'l say that neo is a protestant. So braces are hell 4 now. My teeth dont touch so i cant even chew. So 4 now im crumbling soft baked cookies against the roof of my mouth. Its rainin like hell so g2g b4 my grandma gets paranoid, there she comes now, cya  Erik

      Yeay.&nbsp;   Anyway, what in the hell is the S&D?&nbsp; And come ON, Erik.&nbsp; I'm not bugging you about the "u"s and stuff, but PLEASE don't use 2 and 4 when you mean "two" or "to" or "for".&nbsp; They're fine for "two" and "four", however.  Yes, hiatus is a fancy word for break, and and--get ready--I thought the Oracle was Jewish too.&nbsp; Yep...  Anyway, back to your sick and distasteful idea of a "sense of humor".&nbsp; I've never seen an episode of  South Park,  seeing as I do not have cable.&nbsp; No idear who Cartman is.&nbsp; But that is not the point.&nbsp; The point is that priest molestation is a serious, current, REAL issue, and there are dozens, if not hundreds, of children who need a voice.&nbsp; I fail to see how that could be humorous in any way.&nbsp; Furthermore,  "if u ate thru ur ass crak u could crap out of ur mouth."&nbsp;  That is so not funny.&nbsp; It's pathetic.&nbsp; It is disgusting and vulgar and crude.&nbsp; It is humor for the intellectually challenged, those who lie in front of the television, rotting away their brains, with their eyes blank and void of all emotion, as well as their minds.&nbsp; The mouth is cracked open, and while feces are not coming out that way, the IQ points rushing out from all exits are almost palpable.  Whatever.  What did you think of  Stormbreaker ?&nbsp; It was excellent!&nbsp; I read it several years ago, and although Allison currently has my copy, I reread it often.&nbsp; It is a series, and so far there are four:  Stormbreaker, Point Blank, Skeleton Key  and  Eagle Strike.   The first is the best.  Bye.

       OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH   COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLOOOOORRR   sry, i just found that out, ur right, that was just fear of the unknown back then, salute 2 the S&D. Whats a hiatus again? dont answer that, i guess its a fancy word 4 break. Looking to ur naive matrix questions, i laugh at the fact that u thought the oracle was white. Now that is funny. As 4 the crap out of the mouth, u have 2 c the episode. See, its about the priest molestasion and while thinking about it cartman thought that if u ate thru ur ass crak u  could crap out of ur mouth. Im not getting my rubber bands yet so. . . -  pretty   colors , Erik

      ...bitch, just in case a parent walks by.  I got them a couple of hours ago and i feel like ive been labled. They dont hurt as much as people say, at least until now. My parents bought me rice pudding, soft cookies so that just kiks plain ass.  Im reading the past ones and if em still hasent seen the second 1 ( which i proudly own), it has a lot of fighting too. My Xbox live kinda broke down so im bored. Especially considering that i own the last 4 posts here. I like the remake keep up the good work i guess. Thank god soto dint join or we'd have 2 censor 2. My brace colors are red until sep 21 - around there. they hurt putting them on, and it feels weird but i guess thats normal. Well , until next time that i am this bored . . .

      Erik.&nbsp; After taking a good 4-month hiatus, you come toddling back.&nbsp; No, wrong word.&nbsp; "Toddling" is a cute word.&nbsp; It should be used to describe my kids.&nbsp; Not you.&nbsp; I don't know what word to use.&nbsp; And I have to say I was disgusted by your post.&nbsp;  "having cartman crap out of his mouth."&nbsp;  That is purely sick and disgusting.&nbsp; But you are a male.&nbsp; Of course you find these things funny.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; Laugh.&nbsp; I'll watch your brain leak out of your ears, and keep track of your missing IQ points with my new calculator.  Furthermore: According to you, braces are  "Worse than death and hell."&nbsp;  Oh hardly, you big baby.&nbsp; Grow up, and be a man.&nbsp; I got them about a year and a half ago, and I GOT OVER IT.&nbsp; SO SHOULD YOU.&nbsp; Why will making such a scene about them help?&nbsp; If you want to be pitied and petted, go to your mother.  Sorry.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;overreacting a bit.&nbsp; More&nbsp;than a bit.&nbsp; But please, do&nbsp;a bit of growing up.&nbsp; Because finding excrement exiting through a mouth is just plain sick and earns you points with nobody.  But I am glad you are alive.&nbsp; And braces are not that bad.&nbsp; Sure, they hurt for a while.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; Eating mashed potatoes and baby food for a week or so won't do you any lasting damage.&nbsp;   Looking forward to school and speech and debate,

      Maria u spelled stalker wrong. Im typing this from my "sis's" laptop which my dad is lending her typing this crap ( lemme cuss a lil just bcuz my censorship doesent feel right) shit*,  so im THAT fucking bored. So i cant wait to crack this shell where my only peep hole is downstairs connected 2 the internet where ppl say dirty words, how i envy them.  Yes, it is sad how i am breaking into conversation after just noticing that maria was on, a blog isnt enuff, we need an IM or something because i feel so lonely in this hell w/ my grandma mumbling about all my imperfections and my sister kissing every shit that comes out of her mouth. Sadly that is the most poetic thing i have said all summer. 4 me this has been the summer of classic rock. W/ these gay posers @ my new summercamp "sym gym" these guys are so desperate to rhyme. They have activities like guard start, bay play and some other gay crap i cant remember. But its a good rich-bitch summer camp. Kiawah was fun in that kik ass beach house even though it rained every single fucking ( how i love that word) day. At least i was with my cousins. I write this essay because i am that bored. I h8 the fact that they have that "back to school" crap already at the mall.  well, g2g. BYE

I got the 1st 4 seasons of the simpsons only bcuz i my dad would catch me watching south park. But its a cool show. So ic the debate. The matrix - y the oracle died. I dint notice the lady changed - its what plastic surgery can do 2 ppl these days. Talking about that . . . Some of my mom's plastic friends are gettin boobs and that is how insanely lame my summers been. Well . . . i saw the blokbusters - Irobot and spider man 2, gr8 movies both. Well, g2g cuz its getting l8 have 2 finish stormbreaker so peace i guess, dying 2 come out of the clean-languaged hell but dont wanna do HW- Erik

      I take a week's "haiatiusy" thingy (gotta check back 4 the spelling). And sadly i see 1 fucking post. Apparently im not the only one. So, its 8:26 and south park is at 9:30 so i have time to kill. I fixed my Xbox live and i can finally go and kik some terrorist (or couter-terrorist) ass. KILL KILL KILL KILL. i feel so powerful even though i have died 4 ever 1.2 kills i have made. I am proud to say that i rank about 25k out of 50k so i KIK ASS. My sister went crazy over a basketball skirmish today. Good game but with my sisters "cheers" and some good video editing would have made for a "fucking" hillarious porn movie. She kept on yelling "OH YA" "WE SCORED" "WHOSE THE MAN!?!" "USA, USA, USA". Use your imagination to the fullest extent- i dare ya.I cant wait 4 emily K to comment this. Now that will be so much funnier. Bored - Erik
