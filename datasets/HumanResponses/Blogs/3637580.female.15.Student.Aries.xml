      There WAS an earthquake last night! I even saw it on the news. It was in Illinois, BUUUTT if anyones was as smart as me they would know that the AFTER shock/tremor thing can effect the surrounding states. I mean it is called an EARTHquake effecting the EARTH, more than just the spot it happened at. So yes at 1 sumthing in the morning my freaking couch shook and it scared the shit out of me. And then today I turned on the news and bam I'm not fucking crazy there wwwaaasss an earthquake (not that I had thought of that at the time but anyway..) and Lindsey felt it to so I KNOW I'm not crazy haha. I just had to write this for all those who felt the need to make me feel stupid. CAUSE if you watched the news then you'd now what REALLY happened!!!

      Yeah I said it...sometimes I HATE having friends. Or maybe it's not that, maybe it's just some of the friends I've chosen SUCK. Not to say that ALL the friends I have suck, cause some of them rock majorly, but latley I can't say the same for others. If I have to worry about this type of shit, then I don't think I should call this friendship it's more like making me out to a be a bitch for alot of shit I never did. That's really what the fuck it is...  This week has been pretty damn good. I haven't had to be around my family and that's awesome. But Olivia left for Italy thursday, yes she left me HERE ugh...but she called me before boarding the plane on friday and she emailed me yesterday. This following weekend is July 4th and I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. This is a pointless stupid paragraph but whatever...    As for the "boy" stuff, I guess I shouldn't start writing cause there's absolutely nothing to report. I don't know what's going on like usual, I do know I'm probally wanting more than I'll get, and I think that I'm possibly being let down slowly but I'm not really worring about it cause that's not going to change what happens. Hey I guess theres no reason to give up though..hhmmm i dunno??  Today was Seth's graduation party, I had to watch all the little kids there while the family party was going on, of course I hated every minute of that but I mean I did get paid so w/e. At some point I decided I was way to damn bored so I called Lindsey and made her come to the party. Seth had Derek and Brandon there at first, they invited me and Lindsey to the "after the family leaves" party, Seth got a DJ and had his friends bring some alchy and stuff, we left cause I wasn't about to spend my night with a bunch of drunk seniors...  My night really progressed into nothing. I came home and I've been sitting here for sooo long.  theres nothing else to write if i think of something well then...i'll write it.

      Well Tonight I had a pretty good time. Michael picked me up and took me to Jen's. It was so good seeing him. He really used to be one of my best friends ever!Everyone was over there, I felt kinda weird walking in at 10:30, you could tell everyone had already been having a really good time. Bret, Reese, Stephie, Shelly, and Brena were all there, There were also 3 other people I hadn't met before.  I really wish all of us could have kept in touch more. Mikey and me talked for a while, he's such a dick sometimes, but I love that kid. He used to be there for me all the time, I could tell him like anything, But it was kinda weird...we talked about him and Reese and what happened to them. I dunno man. I told him I was "talking" to someone , but I can't even talk to him about the smallest things like that, not after what happened. haha I used to be able to tell him anything, like I could even tell him my "girl" problems that's how comfortable I became with him, But now I can't even talk to him about anything. We both could tell it was weird. But other than the whole.."mikey and me thing" , I had a really good time.   Ugh..anyway enough of that.. I don't even know what's going on anymore. I keep hoping for the best with everything, but I trully just can't tell if things are going good or bad. I really want things to work, and i know they have the potential to go somewhere.Is that weird for me to want that, I mean should I just wanna sit back and let nothing happen.I DUNNO UGHHH!! I just want things to be understandable and not confusing cause I think that would make things sooo much better! But that's just my opinion. I mean things are kinda laid back, so I don't wanna seem impulsive and be like...WHAT'S GOING ON ..!??!?!So I don't say anything at all.. I just sit back and wait for what never comes. I just hate things when they are un-clear..I think someone needs so to step up and take the initiative !! haha  But it's cool. This time's gunna be diffrent , I'm not getting worked up over something that's not even going wrong. But who knows? BoYs ArE hArD wOrK!!   Man...I have no attention span..I've been writing this thing for like an hour, but I have the T.V. on and so I keep losing my concentration haha. Opps..ohh well.   OLIVIA STANSIC!! What am I going to do without you for 2 whole weeks!! And it's the fact that your going to be in freaking Italy!! But it's ok cause your going to the Prada outlet for me!! (ohh wait i don't have 200 dollars..) You better at least email me once from there and tell me about the WONDERFUL Italian guys that you meet! haha!  This is a stupid pointless entry ...Sry if you were looking foward to something good and juicy, cause this isn't it!! It's just a bunch of stupid random things! I have alot more stupid stuff to write about but I'm really tired and I guess I'm going to bed now....Night

      Man! I'm begining to think that these Blog things aren't very good for friendships! haha. I'm kinda in awe about the fact that two people who have never once met in their lives can basically hate each other because of what is posted in theirs Blogs. I find that a bit fucked up. These Blog things can't possibly do any good to anyone excep for the person writing it, because as far as I can tell everyone is pissed off at everyone just because the writer of the blog said one little thing...OK come on guys GET OVER IT!  Yeah something that really bothers me, is when people have feelings about something that either pisses them off or upsets them in some way, but they can't come to me and tell me about it. They have to post this shit all over their blog, but they can't try to come and talk to me about it. Why the hell don't I get the respect from someone, to come and actually talk to me about it, I mean finding it online sure as fuck dosen't make me happy. Is it supposed to ?? Is that what they were aiming for? You know what I don't really even care.   I'm done for now...later

      Yeah well as I told you already today is my dad's birthday. So today I went out to shop for him and what not.**that comes later. Before leaving the house I got that meaningless piece of paper in the mail, what I am talking about you ask...my report card. I ripped it open only to find that I was offically fucked. I went from making my parents proud to Damn our daughter is stupid..at least that's the way their treating me. Last semester I had pretty awesome grades.. my accumilated GPA was 3.5...haha now it's a 2.8. I went from being 54th in our class out of 576...to 124th out of 533. I came out with my worst final grade being a D+, in Honors Algebra. from there it was C-,C,B,B,A. I mean in all honesty it's not that bad, of course I could do better but it's not horrible...think AGAIN, my mom is having a heart attack over it. Not only is she appalled at my "preposterous" grades but by my "un-heard of" number of tardies. Ok yeah 79 in one year is alot. But i mean come on, it's not that bad.   As I told you before today is my dad's birthday, so I went and got him ballons and a card and delivered them to his office. There I ran into Jackie (one of his many ex's) and she hugged me and all that, asking me how I've been. So we're talking and Trish (the major bitch) comes around the corner and then I dunno why but the two start going at it, yelling and al that stupid shit. I HATE when people fight(I guess it was just one of those natural territory type of things with chicks I dunno)so for some insane reason they start yelling at each other, I seriously was waiting for these two adults in their nice professional buisness suits to duke it out right then and there, but they didn't they just kept yelling. Everyone's heads are now peeking out and over their little cubicles and out of the doors of their offices.All the little secreteries are shuffling over to each others desks starting the office gossip. It was like I could see everything that was going on. So then my dad came out and joined in on the yelling. I left , I doubt any of them noticed , I mumbled Happy Birthday ..this was the best one yet as I left. It was sad , I felt so grown up then because of how childish these three adutts were acting.   Olivia...sorry sorry sorry sorry!! You know I love you and I'd never say anything that you wouldn't want other people to know! KISSES muah!!   I'm done for now...maybe I'll write later

      So last night I couldn't sleep worth shit. I was tired as hell, but that didn't matter I just couldn't get to sleep. I think I finally got to sleep at 5:00 am...yeah 5 in the fucking morning. I listened to The places you have come to fear the most like 6 times, I just kept replaying it and replaying it cause I was to lazy to get up and put in another CD. I have offically come to hate that CD and don't plan on listening to it for a while, I really did out play that last night.  Anyway..this morning I re-read my last blog entry and it kinda made me laugh, I was a little over dramatic wouldn't ya say... I'm sure things are fine, and if they aren't then me bitching about them isn't going to make life eaiser. One of the things I hate most about people is when they bitch about stuff that can't get better, but then I'm such a hypocrite cause I do it all the time. HaHa I hope people are actually gunna talk to me after that entry..oh well, we'll see I guess.   Other shit I wanted to talk about in my blog last night but other stuff seemed to come-up..Olivia told me last night that her and Phil are now dating. Hmm...I think it's weird, I'm glad for her and all , but when I look at Phil , I see a funny guy who makes everybody laugh, not a Mr.relationship, he seems really un-commited. I hope I'm wrong. I also hope that he'll treat Olivia good, not be an asshole and forget to call all the time, then get drunk on the weekends and make out with other girls. Cause Liv is to good for that type of thing , so hopefully he knows that going in to this. Cause if Phil hurts her well I believe I'll have to cut his dick off...(that was one for Liv haha) Another thing..so many people comlain about being single. I've been singel FOREVER and I seldomly complain about, I mean yeah once in a while I'll talk about it , but NOT EVERY SECOND do I complain about it non-stop. I mean come on people...  Today it's my dad's birthday..WOO! Let's all re-joice that the asshole is another year older.I don't like him. It really sucks.. the way me and him have been getting along latley. I used to have the best relationdship with my dad, he used to be sooo cool. I'd like to say it's cause of his new stupid slut of a girlfriend that we no longer have that relationship, but then I get the question...Why didn't it bother you with his other five girlfriends (yes I said other 5 ..meaning all 5 at one point movied in with us, IN OUR house) But this chic is diffrent , major bitch. I'd met her two times before she moved in with us this past Christmas eve, so yes she was there Christmas morning, I knew her only as a stranger. Not only was she a stranger in my home but on freaking Christmas, anyway..she thinks she's my mother and she has some obsurd idea that she can disipline and tell me what to do. If you know me, then you know I hate that type of shit. I don't even like it when my parents try to restrict my social plans (meaning the ground me ) so I'm sure you can imagine what it's like when she tried. The first couple months I kept my mouth shut, trying to make the situation work. But by mid March I couldn't take her shit anymore, She always had some smart ass comments to shoot at me. One night we were in the car and I asked my dad if after dinner he could take me to the mall because I needed some new pants. He was in a pissed off mood, and he said "I just gave your mom 400 dollars for child support", Now he meant it as I don't really have the money right now to take you shopping, even though I knew what he meant I commented back.."Dad you know that moneys not for me it's for paying bills that you USED to have to pay before you decided to move out" (I knew it'd piss him off, of course that's why I said it) But no Trish ignores the fact that I'm speaking to my dad about something that is NONE of her buisness and she chimes right in..."No your mom is wrong cause that money is for you, not her, she can't spend that personally, is your mom really that stupid." UMM OK BITCH..did you really just talk about my mom like that , are you fuckng retarded. We argued about it intill we pulled in the garage. She was still talking, but I just went in the house and slammed my bedroom door. I guess that night my dad felt bad because he never said anything to defend me even though he knew I was right and she had to buisness saying anything in the first place, so he took me to the mall. (yes I am a spoiled only child..hehe) And you can imagine that the Bitch was extra bitchy because of this. We got home and she immediately asked how much he spent on me..that was the first time I snaped , "Why the hell does it matter to you, I hate you and your ruining my life" ...DOOR SLAMS. HAHA yeah so this is the point where my dad totally takes her side and tells me if this is the way I'm going to act I'll have to move in with my mom for a while. The next day I got all my clothes and my mom came to pick me,I was carrying them all downstairs, and Trish stopped and said ..(these are her exact words..cause I still haven't forgot them)..Wow you really are a little spoiled ass brat, look at all those clothes, making you father spend his hard earned money on more...That's a shame your so shallow...I screamed FUCK YOU and left..to my suprise, my mom just smiled when I told her that...Yeah so that's the story of the reason I can't stand my father. Theres alot more but I've definitly already bored everyone with enough.  It's thursday and I have no plans...I hope I will end up having plans today..I thought I was supposed to , But I dunno..I hope to..anyway I'm gunna go for now...later

      Yeah so as Nick said earlier.."seems like everyones taking shots at you today"..and for the record, he's right. But you know what it dosen't bother me, I mean the points everyone is making are true..like I guess compared to Nick and Justin's blog's mine does seem like some stupid diary, their writing actually means something,and I know mine dosen't...but once again..I'm still not going to stop writing. Just like I'm not going to stop listening to "their" music, cause I like it , end-of-story. Dis-like me for that if you want to, but I like the music and I'm going to listen to it. I'm listening when you say that I can't understand what the music means to you..and your right I don't , but if you really don't wanna like me because of the music I play in my stereo, then I'm sorry for you...cause there is more to me then just the music I listen to.   I found out that Alice was the one posting comment after comment about me being funny..and a liar and stuff like that. Man I would have never guessed it was her. I guess she dosen't like me, Nick said it's cause of the music thing, I guess I just really don't get it. And I think that sucks because I really always thought Alice was cool..I mean i still don't have a problem with her I just feel like I wasn't even given a chance to be liked. That sucks man, it really does.I really hope she'll eventually change her opinion of me..maybe..or maybe not, we'll see.  I kinda feel like I'm getting attacked with the issues involving punk music and my decision to listen to it. Nick told me he thinks I'm a poser, beacuse I listen to Yellowcard (who are sell-outs), and I was planning on going to Warped not knowing many of the bands there, and also because I would be hated there not only for not being ignorant of the bands that are playing, but because the tag on my clothing reads hollister or abercrombie and fitch. Wow. That hits me hard, that people seriously care that much. I'm not supposed to be allowed to listen to a certain type of music enless my clothing is appropriate, and because I didn't discover Punk as my first source of music, and because I've just now begun to like it, I have people changing and forming opinions about me. That actually hurts.   And you know what else hurts..theres this guy I like. I think all the above applies to him. I think he's changing his opinion of me because of the music situation. I wish he could actually get to know who I am before doing that.We are two really diffrent people but I liked him alot, his being totally oppiste of me taking part in that. He's not like other guys, cause he's not predictable, that's something I love about him. He always has good stories to tell and he can always make me laugh, two more qualities I love in that kid. He has the reputation of being an asshole, and fucking things up repeatedly, but I always thought that he didn't mean it, It wasn't like he wanted it to happen it just did. I never really tried to worry about all the shit people told me about him, if he was a mistake I'd figure it out on my own. I really don't know about any of this or where him and I stand, but I do know that my head kinda hurts analyzing all of this.  All this really sucks...yes I'm complaining about my fucking life, and all my stupid little fucking problems. I'm such a fuckng cry baby.It's 1:25 in the fucking morning and I'm tired so I'm going to bed so I can cry about this shit to myself some more..later...

      So today was awesome..just like I said it would be haha. Madi,Emily, Tim Jordan, and myself went to the beach in Tim's jeep. He unzipped all the windows and took off the doors , it was pretty cool. I think riding there and back was one of the best parts (as funny as that sounds)your hair is going everywhere, it's cold as hell from the wind, it's also loud as hell..all you can hear is the music blasting along with the wind wiping by...but I loved it all. We got to the beach around 2 and the weather was pretty good, sunny but not to hot. We just hung out..most people would probally think that the day we had was boring and pointless, but today was the definition of what I want my summer to be. Just spending the day with my best friend...having fun doing absolutely nothing. We had some crazy in depth conversations too haha who'd ever know that Madi and me could actually have an in depth conversation, without being extremley retarded.  Awww...I swear Tim and Emily are the cutest thing ever. If they aren't perfect I don't know who is. They have the relationship that everybody wants, they are each others best friend, it's the coolest thing ever. Just watching them wrestle on the beach and goof off, and then be all lovey dovey later..it just shows how strong of a relationship they really have. Even just the simple things , like the way that they smile at each other..That's what I want, someone i can just be myself around no matter what and not worry about what they think. I think the thing I want most is just someone to care about me...and that's one of the hardest things to find.  Madi made a point on her Blog the other day about the way guys act. Yeah her point...." you think someone likes you but you can never really tell..I just hate it when you really like somebody but they're all like afraid to open up ..or they say they like you , but you never really know where you stand with that person?"..this is coming directly from Madeline's blog...ohh yeah you should check hers out too...   urlLink    ..(there!!) But anyway back to the point..she is exactly right! I'm all about putting it out on the table. I hate not knowing, or wondering about what's going on. And that opens this subject up..I hate it when people don't give a fuck about anyone elses feelings. I just don't understand how there can be no type of compassion for other peoples feeling..  Nick thinks I write weird, along with some random person that posted the comment.."yes you do" referring to me writing weird. Just because I'm not all deep..and I don't have perfect "structure" in my writing dosen't make it bad, at least not in my eyes. OHH GREAT..I just got an e-mail telling me I got another comment on my Blog about how weird I write..WELL FOR ALL YOU Anonymous commenters...I DON'T CARE! I'm not "working" on my writing because I don't want to , I like it just how it is ..so if you hate it...DON'T READ IT. ugh...man! Well I'm tired of writing for now..so I'll just post this so everyone can SAY HOW MUCH THEY HATE IT haha!  **no one will understand the title except Madi..so don't even try..

      Yay!! Today I'm going to the beach..my favorite place ever! Madi and me are gunna go, in Tims jeep, it's going to be so much fun! Yeah well I just felt the need to tell everyone that, and when I get back I'll be sure to tell you all our crazy stories cause when you put Madi and me together OF course your gunna have crazy stories...  Ohh yeah and once again..I don't write weird...this is to whoever posted that last comment...(I believe i know who you are..!)  I'll write later...

      Yeah...Maddie and I put up a CrAzY fight with this piece of shit website today. I decided to start a blog..cause it's so much cooler than xanga. (Nick.. your probally gunna get so shitty...every ones taking your idea!! Haha ohh well, I'm giving you credit for the idea so be happy!!)   So today was pretty awesome, Madi and I hung out for a while and then headed to coldstone for some shitty icecream. That was SoOoOo not what I thought it was gunna be. Everyone (especially Mikey!) said that the icecream was the best...EVER! Well I beg to differ..I mean really ppl made this stuff sound like it was orgasmic. Nope, nope it definitly wasn't. Olivia informed me that Madi and I both just picked the two worst flavors in the place...so we'll have to go back and try one more time and then we'll see for sure haha! Nick was working today..aww hard little working boy..I just felt the need to say that.  I think people have a really big problem with keeping secrets. I really don't know that many people (actually there might only be one maybe two but that's pushing it) that I can actually tell something and not wonder how far it's gotten around after 10 minutes. Like one thing is I've seen it...even with some of my closest friends..They say one thing and do the OPPISITE..and i don't know why I don't expect them to turn around and do it to me. I guess that's funny that I'd call these people "close friends" when I have to ask questions like that, but I dunno..even when shit like that happens, for some reason I just keep coming back for more. W/e man haha..  Man..I can't believe schools been out less than a week..it sure as hell dosen't seem like it. It feels like we've been out for a month. Yeah I miss some stuff about school ..Like all the long assignments, hard bookwork, having to use my mind constructively, and listening to teachers and all their boring lectures..haha OR NOT...the only thing I really miss is the social part, like getting to see everyone everyday. Half the people that I considered "good friends" probally won't keep in touch. Ohh yeah I forgot one thing that I'm REALLY gunna miss about freshman year..ok get ready..JASON SABO! haha man I'll miss staring at him. (wow..can you say obsessed loser haha)But I mean really, DEEP down EVERYBODY thought Jason Sabo was hot, yeah even the GUYS haha! Anyway so back to the point..If this summer could be like school minus the books that'd be totally awesome, but since it can't I'll at least say this, This summer HAS to be Kick-Ass..it just has to be! There better be a least a couple good concerts, lots of BEACH time, hanging out with friends allll the time, and just living it up haha. Ok well I'm done for now...

      hehehe yes those are Ashlee Simpson lyrics! I really love all her songs. Yes..Nick your right they are really stupid lyrics, cause she talks about getting tan and fishing but I still Love it!! Except you did kinda ruin it, I can't listen to the fish part without laughing my ass off.  God I'm never home anymore, ever! My life now consists of watching re-run after re-run of Dora the Explorer and Thomas the Train. Being woke up early to watch little Energizer Bunnys as I like to call them. Feeding them, changing them, keeping them entertained...it's all just part of the new "what-seems-like everyday" agenda. I don't know how much longer I can take it but I do know that I definitly do need the money. But a job at the mall would for sure be much more fitting haha!  So the whole "new sister" thing is working out really well. It's like having a whole bunch of new cool stuff and a new friend. She kicks major ass. We decided we'd share all our clothes and shoes and purses and hair stuff and...yeah well like everything. She's so much fun, we went shopping the other day too, great sister bonding haha. As hard as I really thought this was going to be it's not. It's one of the coolest thing thats ever happened. The whole sharing thing came out good. I thought I was going to be super annoyed  but I'm not so far so that's awesome. i probally sound stupid..oh well whatever.   I don't know how well the whole blog thing is going, I can't ever think of anything to write and I never feel like it.  Ok well I'm out...LaTeR

      I was to tired to finish talking about what I wanted to yesterday so here I go. I forgot to say that my dad and his girlfriend announced they were having a baby (wait don't get ahead of yourself) they told me that they had something important to tell me, and they began with theres going to be a new arrival to the family, so they decided to play a little joke on me..hahaha the ignorance of elders..bad move. I just stared at them and then commented that I didn't know what the hell they were doing trying to get pregnant at the age of 47. They stopped my shouting by saying JUST KIDDING! What the hell is that? You seriously DON'T joke about that. In turn they tell me that Trish's daughter will be moving in with us. I don't know what to think about this. She got to our house last night at like 2 AM. It's going to be so diffrent from me. I'm a spoiled only child, who's always got whatever I wanted and I NEVER had to share it. I had (up to this point) my own bathroom, but now I'm going to have to share it. I'm going to have to share my shower and my drawers and my vanity. Get this they're even giving her MY dresser, the ONLY reason I'm not mad about this is that I've been wanting a new one for a while, but still, it's not as if they took that into consideration. I guess this situation could also be cool, I mean I've never really had a sister. SO maybe in that sense things will be cool, plus she has a car so maybe she can uhh give me rides places! haha..anyway Everything kinda sucked last night, no one was paying attention to me, they were just putting all their effort into Jessie coming, and making her arrival happy. Not that they pay attention to me anyway...   So Soccer today..damn they worked us hard. We ran Notre Dame, we got in 5 miles. It was a really good work-out though. Tomorrow we have prectice again from 7-9 and then we're all going to the beach it's going to be really fun. It'll be the girls and guys soccer team...(if ONLY this was last year when Jason Sabo was on the team...:( haha.. KIDDING) My legs hurt MUCHO bad, and I have a muscle pull in my back and I need a MUCHO good massage for it haha! (wow gotta love the spanish skills)  HaHaHa boys suck! maaan...so I'm pretty close to positive all the "talking" stuff is over. I know people are probally looking at this like...Damn bitch it took you a while to figure that out. hahaha whatever...fuckers  Seth asked me to go to his grad. party Sat. cause it's also his cousin Ryan's. Ryan's fat and he dosen't have alot of friends hahahaha so Seth was like yyyeaahhh...bring a bunch of friends up there so Ryan feels cool. Haha that kid's a dork!   I think I'm going up to the lake this weekend. It should be pretty kick ass, if I can bring someone with me otherwise it's probally gunna suck cause who knows if michael, and all the neighbors will be up, and I HATE being stuck with the family...  Well I gotta get up at 7 tomorrow so I better get my ass to bed...LaTeR

      So Monday was the first day of soccer conditioning. Yes I have been in anticipation all summer for this to begin!!! I mean COME ON who wouldn't wanna get up every morning at 6 AM (yes that is the morning) and get to soccer at promtley seven and then run like 5 miles or sprint the whole morning. Tuesday is when it started to get bad, We ran about 4 or 5 miles I think. It was tough. We also did alot of ab work, which didn't seem so bad intill I tried to get out of bed this morning...sore muscles really suck. Today was better though, we did sprints(diagonals) which hurt after about the 6th one but those aren't nearly as bad for me as distance. Mandy lined us up for ladders, and all of us were so tired from the sprints we just finished, She looked at us and then said Fuck this we're going to Studebagels, that was awesome by far. We came back and scrimaged with the boys. Haha it's funny to think the last time I scrimaged with the boys team was last year when I broke my arm. That fucking sucked. But I'm really glad I decided to get off my ass and get back into soccer. I really didn't have an excuse last year, cause my arm was better by the time conditioning started in the summer, I just knew no one at all so I didn't go, I guess you could say I was scared. Well that and laziness played a factor in it to. Even though we only did sprints and perimeter today my muscles are killing me, I feel like someone kicked my ass 3 times. OuCh!  Ohh so as for Lauren's party this past weekend, It turned out to be really awesome. It was Lauren, Lucy, Lindsey, Lesley, Kristen, Sarah and myself. We went Tubing like 20 times and we Jet skied a couple times too. Lindsey, Lauren, and me water skied also. We all got along really well and there were no fights or anything. I love LoLo she's such a sweetie! And off the subject but I can't WAIT till she gets her car! haha Lindsey and me decided were buying her a taxi light to stick on the top of her car..ok not really but we are for sure riding around in her 13 year old Ford Taurus with style. I mean come on the boa in the back window, the seat belt covers and the air freshener COMPLIMENTS of ME, and the fuzzy stearing wheel, it will be hot for sure, in a cheesy 80's type of way haha..  I have more to say but it's 10 in the morning I REALLY need a shower and then I think I'll sleep for a while. LaTeR...As Bigs (Simone) always says...Holler

      Yes so for the last hour or so I have been trying to finish this movie, I suggest if you've already seen a Harry Potter movie, then be happy with it, believe me your good to go. Once is enough. Watching them twice is not very entertaining at all.   So this weekend is going to be what you could call fun, and I guess you could say I'm excited. Lauren's having a 16th birthday party at her lake house. (of course for all girls) Hopefully the weather dosen't suck because I wanna get TAN haha. Or I should probally say burnt, I really don't tan anymore, but it's ok cause my burn usually fades into a nice tan. Hopefully this weekend won't turn into a bitch fest being that there will be almost 10 girls,we all know that that could get ugly. Hopefully things will go well. My dad is also freaking out because he didn't realize I'd be gone for the weekend. He said he'd told people I would be at a cookout. Ohhhh...lets alert the press I can't be at a little family function (well I thought it was a family function) Then he made me aware that it was a cook-out with "her" family. Ugh..she is the most annoying repulsive sickening person I've ever met. I may sound like a bitch but it's true. I'm not even going to waste anyones time going on about her.  So Jasmine and myself decided that theres just something about punk guys haha. We decided on the whole tight Levi's theory a long time ago, but the other day we were at the mall and we just kept seeing (Jazzy's word)"sirens". haha I love you Jaz your one of the goofiest people I know but you can be so serious when I need you to, you rock. Anyway back to the point we decided you can look at an "abercrombie" boy and be awed by his amount of gorgeousness for a couple of minutes but with a punk-rocker boy, they just have this on going cuteness haha. Would you rather have a boy that stares in the mirror all day adoring his looks, or a guy who already knows he's hot and plays guitar all day. This paragraph is mainly for Jaz so sorry for all of you who think this is extremley dumb and don't understand but ...well your just going to have to get over it!  Monday kicks off soccer conditioning WOO-HOO, I'm looking foward to running my ass off, and being sore everyday from drills that I haven't done in forever! Yes practices twice a day, so I can have no other plans! I AM SOOO looking foward to Soccer. OK really it's not that bad, but I know it's gunna be a pain in the ass. Especially the 8:00 AM practices.   BoYs confuse me! They like to say one thing because they know it's what you want to hear but it's not really what they mean, they hide the truth. Hmmmm..or at least that's my opinion. For once I just wanna know FOR REAL, like what's REALLY going on , cause right now I kinda feel like I'm just waiting around to get fucked over. I hope I'm not but I can't help but to think that it's going in that direction I dunno, I guess time will tell.   The next few weeks are going to be no fun. Everyones going on vacation to some great place and I'm stuck here. Olivia's having bunches of fun in Italy , we email back and forth. Then Ashley's leaving to go on her cruise to Mexico. Lindsey's in Colorado. Then it seems like everyone else is going on vacation too. To leave me here all alone. Wishing I was anywhere but here.  I've been having this crazy craving for gatorade.   Nick seems to think Away from here sucks. I like them!! so quit being a jerk and shut up Nick cause I think their GoOd!! hahaha just joking don't get all serious on me.  AhHhHhH Voldermont is SCARY!!! ehhhhh!!!!!   I need to get a job really bad. I really need the money.  That was alot of random thoughts in a row...  Well I'm signing off for now, cause my eyes hurt. Maybe I should start wearing my contacts again, i'm going blind anyway so it dosent matter. haha. LaTeR...!

      So yeah I just got done taking that little Online boating saftey course pre-test (haha..that's another story..it'll come later)and I got a 58/75 opps,  I need to work on that on haha.   Yeah so as for the big Canada trip, well Lauren ended up inviting me to come to her lake house for the weekend, and I talked it over with my dad, and he said he wouldn't mind if I didn't go to Canada cause it wouldn't be a fun trip and plus I barley even knew his dad. So that was that. We went up to Laurens lake house on Friday. It was way fun. I mean hello it's me and Lauren!!! haha So we layed out Saturday and we decide heeey lets go out on the Jet-Ski, so we're doing all kind of crazy circles and stuff and we come aroud and we're speeding into the dock and then we realize that the boat sheriff is trying to pull us over ..opps. So he asks for boat registration and laurens boating saftey certificate. Well they had the registration for the jet ski but it was expired and they didn't have the serial number on it. Strike one and two, then Lauren didn't have a boating license either. Strike three. But we played dumb, Lauren said she thought you only had to have a drivers license and her dad made something up about the serial number issue, also the cop looked like a total nerd so he just said we needed to get boating saftey licenses and get the serial number on the jet ski and we'd be set. So yes no ticket. Lauren and me decided he only pulled us over cause we were some hot chicks and he knew pulling us over would be as close as he could ever get. haha pssshhh...well we had some really good laughs on that. So of course after that Lauren was to scared to Jet Ski , but I still ended up going with Michael , who is SUCH a crazy driver. So we ended up having an awesome time up at the lake.  We have 10 days till school starts , I need to clothing/accesories shop,supply shop, and highlight/cut my hair. Busy week. My ankle still isn't better so I have a doctors appointment next week again. I don't even know if I can play Northridge, which sucks majorly bad. I hate sitting out,it sucks.  The olympics started this weekend, the bastards have yet to play soccer ...ugh!  I'm cold so I'm gunna go sleep in a big huge warm fleece blanket yyaayy!! haha

      I posted that gay survey so now i'm posting more gayness yay haha!  Soccer has been miserable. Try-outs were so hard, I never would have imagined that it was really that hard. I ended up going to the doctor because my ankle had really been bothering me, and then I came to find out that I ripped a tendon. So from Saturday on I rested it and it only seems to be getting worse...ugh what the fuck. I take my stupid medicine and I rest and stand around practice looking like an idiot cause I can't do shit and it dosen't even help, so today I decided even though it still hurt pretty damn bad i'd just stick it out, so I went and during the warm up lap it felt like it was snapping in two, i decided to sit out for the scrimmage. The coach told me and Alyssa (Thompson..who is also injured, same ankle same type of thing as i am..aww me and my big sister are injured together how cute haha...) to pump soccer balls and then just juggle around , kick the ball against the wall (wall ball) a little bit of that stuff, so we did and Mandy got really mad that we were "playing" and not out on the field, she said if you guys are messing around then you can run with us, so alyssa, shannon, and myself (who are all ...as the coach puts it..walking injured..jogged ladders while everyone else sprinted. ) whatever if it dosent get better I have to go back to the fucking doctor...ohh yeah the coach announced teams today...i'm on JV..but the coach said i'll most likley swing, which means I'll play both JV and varsity , which I am totally fine with.  I'm freezing cold right now, my house is like a freaking igloo. I should probally put a sweatshirt on...anyway  I talked to Madeline the other day, I haven't talked to her in a couple weeks or so. We haven't hung out in god-knows-how long, and I'm begining to think that our friendship is slipping. I hate to even think that, cause for the last 4 years or so we've been the best of friends, we've been through alot of shit, and I really do love that girl to death, I hope we can become as close as we were before. Sometimes I just feel slightly replaced by her new friends from Adams. And I wonder if she ever feels that way with the new friends I've made. I don't know but I hope things work themselves out. Once again I'm rambling...  So my dad informed me we will be taking a "little" trip this weekend, yeah we're driving to Canada to see my dying grandfather i've only met once...! GOOD OLD FAMILY VACATION ..it'll be just swelll. OR NOT. 8 hours in the car there, 8 more hours back. i'll miss the jamboree (which isn't even a big deal but still..) it's so annoying. i told my dad we are AT least going shopping once, cause if i'm in the car that long, i want the trip to count for something. OMG I really am a major bitch, my grandpa is dying, the give him about 2 months and I'm worried about the mall..., but it's not my fault, he's never wanted to take the chance to get to know me or anything, I met him once and as far as I could tell he was a pretty big fuck up. he left my grandma, when my dad was 12 and moved to fucking canada, only saw his kids like once a year and then finally stopped seeing them all together, never cared to get to know his 7 grandchildren or his 1 great grandchild. Nope not him. He smoked so many cigarettes (which is why he's dying::lung cancer) it was the most disgusting thing I've ever encountered. It's just hard for me to feel bad, when he hasn't been much of anything to me in my life. but i'm going on like someone cares haha...bllaahhh....
