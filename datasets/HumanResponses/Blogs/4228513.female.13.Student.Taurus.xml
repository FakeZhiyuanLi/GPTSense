      haha... finally... finally... i hav solve some of my problems... at least dere is some improvement... but i still hate myself alot... bcoz of my character... haiz... anyway... the problem dat i had solved is abt the relationship of daredevils... i finally noe wat i shld do... making others happy n nt to hurt them is the most important ba... nxt is who i realli love... tis is still nt solve yet... but i told myself... i will nvr show my sadness in my face... keep it to myself no matter wat... y shld i show... to let others pity me? tis is wat i dun wan most... who i realli love? hw i wish someone can tell me the feeling of loving someone... i realli nt v sure... n i cant make any decision bcoz of tis... wat is dat kind of feeling? who can tell me? someone who is experienced n realli noe wat love is ba... when can i meet dat person? tml is my 'lang du' competition... hw i wish i can win... but the chances is small... my group has nt done well enough... 4get our lines everytime... haiz... wish myself good luck ba... another problem is my godsis... she is good... but bcoz of the way she uses her power,i scare of her... she was once hurt by one gal n i dun realli noe whether it is call hurt anot... but i tink i hav done something quite similar to wat the gal did... tink she get hurt again ba... i scare of her... she alwaz use her power... haiz... no matter wat juz hope she nt angry... hope she dun get hurt especially by me oso... i say sorie to her but she didnt reply... wat does dat mean? i dun dare to msg her... i m afraid dat she will treat me like she treat dat gal... i tink i m the one who get hurt then... she tinks dat things dun hav to b explained... but i tink dat without explaining,u wun noe anithing... u wun understand anithing... but she juz dun understand... haiz... wat to say then... she is my godsis... realli worry 4 her... when she is hurt she will do something silly... n dere is no way to regret... hw i wish i can tell her tis type of things can b controlled... n she muz learn... dere is no such thing in the world call 'no'...
