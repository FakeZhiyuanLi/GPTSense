      Husband and I went out to eat tonight, AppleBee's. We sat easy in each  other. Content. On the way home, the green house flowers were 50% off.  I got two large geraniums in big pots for the deck. One a light pink  the other a deep dark pink. I will pick up a couple more I think this  weekend. I can easily bring those in during the winter with all the  space I have here now.  Changed into my short blue jean shorts and  a dark blue t-shirt when we got home. Husband went outside to shoot at  a new target, and I vacumned the house up. (Doggy is shedding something  awful right now.) Then I went out on the deck to arrange things with  the plants I got. Set one in the center of the picnic table. As I was  walking about, in the short shorts, I would catch a glimps of my legs,  the muscles there defined in certain places, a nice curve here and  there, not bad for over 40 legs. I was wearing those shorts Saturday  when my sister came to get the children. She was dressed more modestly,  I looked much like a sex pot in contrast, and felt like one too, and  enjoyed showing off my legs, like I did tonight with Husband as  audience. I do a lot of walking at work, busy office AA, and at home,  never sit for long before I am up doing something. I know some of it is  the yoga every AM and then the 30 minute power walk every PM. (Keep  moving.)  I thought about oil painting today. I want to start  getting set up for that so when the quiet of winter is in place in this  northern land, I can paint warm in the house. Curious to know the style  that medium will ease out of me.  Work eased up a bit today. Got out all things that needed getting out. Tomorrow will do final project and love Friday.  In  regards to the man who had the day where everything went wrong, I  wondered again (like a thousand times before) what the point of all  this is. The virtual delights were only to his satisfaction, not mine.  I was left unsated, still to this moment, though I shoved it down,  down, down. It whispers to me, enough of the apologies. Another voice  speaks of pleasing me, of pleasing each other, of fires that burn, and  passions that swim in the romance of life. Of true caring, and touching  in many ways. I hear. I feel, yet I sleep lightly, touch me away. I  drift in the surface waters and there is silence, I know not what to  say anymore. Now that he knows my secret. I am silent.   Whispers,  love,  Rachel    urlLink From the beginning Speeping Beauty Dreams @ DearDiary.net
