      Greetings from "Toothless."  After I posted yesterday, the numbness of the shots wore off and I dove into the prescribed pain medication (PPM) rather quickly.  The part of me that hurts the most is the chipmunk cheek.  Last night, after several cold packs, the swelling went down, but this morning, it was rather large again.  Again, let me assert I am not vain... but rather the chipmunk cheek made it very, very painful to smile or talk -- two things I must be able to do to perform my job.    So, this morning, though I cannot afford to take a day off, I called my sub and I took more PPM and have been sleeping most of the day.  I have had some rather strange dreams on the PPM and the ceiling fan base appears to be moving, too, so it is moving opposite the fan blades and makes me rather dizzy.  I haven't watched any TV yet, but there is a marathon of  Ferris Buhler's Day Off  on TNN.  I would watch, but most of  Shae's Day Off  has been one long nap.  Speaking of naps, it's about medication time, so I will be taking more soon and sleeping the night away!  Good night...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      Toothie has gone bye bye.  After an hour at Dr O'Shell's I am now minus one #15 molar.  After the pain-numbing shots, the left side of my face swelled to the size of an orange.  The doctor peered over his glasses and said, "What you are feeling right now is your face swelling.  This is because of blah, blah, blah, and this is perfectly  normal.   After moving the molar back and forth... he pulls out...  THE DRILL.  Mind you, I really couldn't feel anything, but the sound of the drill hurt my ears!  It sounded like my dad's circular saw, only much faster... and higher pitched.  Finally, it was all over, my face (only one side of it) was huge, and I was handed a prescription for penicillin and vicadin (only if I needed it, and I may need it!).  I get home, and there's no ice in the house for my face and the ice pack the dentist gave me isn't cold yet.  I look like half a chipmunk and my jaw is starting to throb... so I'm going to take about four ibuprofen and lie down now!  I have to go to work tomorrow... it's a good thing that I'm not vain.  ha ha...

      Since I am getting a tooth pulled tomorrow and they  might  have to sedate me... I can't eat after midnight.  So I'm eating at 11:30!   I will update you tomorrow when I get home to let you know how the pain is... or isn't... depending on what they give me for the pain!    Could make for some interesting posts...

      Sigh... it's sleeting in Austin, and that's probably the closest thing I'll get to snow in Texas!    Thursday night, I get a tooth pulled.  The excitement I feel about that, well, I just can't put it into words!  I can tell you that I had no idea how I was going to pay for it, but I made the appointment anyway.  Sunday night, someone handed me an envelope with enough money to pay for the tooth extraction, and enough leftover to help pay for the two crowns I need to get this spring.  God is good!  That's it for this evening.  I promise I'll get the hang of this blog stuff soon... I've been a little busy writing my book though!  Good night!

       TALES OF THE FEVER...   I knew that I had a fever today when I went to put some of my equipment back into the cabinet and put my  glasses  in there instead... then I e-mailed my friend Krista our traditional "Goodbye" e-mail right after that and I addressed it to  myself ...  Oh, yeah, this is really fun!

       BOOK UPDATE   I was working on the ending today and it's going rather well.  I'm just trying tie up all the loose ends.  Would a cliffhanger be a bad thing?  Right now, I'm thinking,  no.   I have edited the first six chapters, and only twenty two more to go!  WOO HOO!  I'm getting excited about this.  Just finishing this book (right, Ahjie?) will be a big deal for me.  Keep praying!

       PIXIE DUST - I WISH IT WAS PIXIE DUST   You know what kind of allergy day it's going to be when you walk outside and  every  car in the parking lot is dusted with yellow pollen.  It's not quite hot enough outside to have the a/c in the car on, but I wish I had it so I could  breathe!   lol...   I am gearing up for more NCAA hoops action this weekend... of course, my brackets are totally messed up, except for the South... don't know why that is!  Ok... I know this is short... but I have to sneeze and it's affecting my typing!  Bis Spater, my friends!

       SHAE’S GREAT AUSTIN ADVENTURE PART TWO   Helpful terms and definitions:   The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC)   - a commission founded in 1891 by the Texas legislature to protect consumers from the railroad companies that were over-charging farmers and other customers. In 1917, because the Commission regulated the mass transit industries of the time, the Commission asserted its jurisdiction over pipelines. As a result, the Railroad Commission began regulating the oil and gas industry since they had the closest ties to the industry via pipelines.  For more info, go to  urlLink http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/    Pledge of Allegiance to the Texas State Flag  -   "Honor the Texas flag; I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas, one and indivisible."   For more info about Texas State Emblems, see  urlLink http://www.texaspolicecentral.com/texaspat.html    Politician Magnet  - any baby under 2 years old.  *************************** 1:15 p.m.  Jene’ and I enter the Senate Chambers.  The Senate Chambers is usually off limits.  Today, however, it has been opened to those invited to the swearing in ceremony.  It’s a cool feeling when you stroll into the Senate Chambers and groups behind you are trying to get in thinking that just anybody can do what we just did.  They are referred to the Senate Gallery on the floor above us while we are told we can actually go beyond the ropes and sit in chairs normally reserved for senators.  How cool is that?  I meet Victor’s parents, Bernardo and Alicia Carrillo.  Bernardo and Alicia came from Mexico when they were kids.  Neither of them passed the third grade, as they had to go to work to help support their families.  They are much older than you would expect, as Victor was born when they were in their late 30's.  Bernardo looks like his chest is going to explode with pride, while Alicia’s smile lights up the room.  They sacrificed so much to see their son be able to live the American dream.  I sit down with Julia, Jene’s youngest sister, who is my age.  Julia has three kids: Benjamin, who is 9 and is so smart, he sometimes sprains my brain as I try to keep up with his questions  -  for example, how the lights in the Senate Chambers were made -   and his explanations - this time about static electricity.  Damaris is almost 2.  She is a long, lean blonde toddler who has the prettiest blue eyes.  She is sitting on Julia’s lap while Jene’, who is standing behind me, holds Julia’s youngest, Grant.  Grant is almost four weeks old and is content and quiet during the ceremony. 	 Victor enters the Senate Chambers with Texas Governor Rick Perry and Lt. Governor David Dewhurst.  As I snap a picture or two, I notice that my camera has reached 23 pictures.  Noticing the TV camera behind my head, I start to feel an overwhelming sense of dread as I figure out what to do, because I know my camera will rewind after the next picture.  I decide to try to time the last picture during applause.  Jene’s dad, Jasper,  is called upon to pray to open the ceremony.  Jene’s dad is a pastor and is known for his, well, lengthy prayers.  Julia leans over and says, “Do they know what they’re getting into?” and I laughed and said, “Did they give him a time limit?”  Later, Victor teases Jasper that the governor leaned over during the middle of the prayer and said something like, “He is aware, isn’t he, that he’s supposed to be finished by now?” “Gotcha!” moment.  After the prayer, Christina leads the crowd in the pledge of the American flag and then the Texas flag.  I asked her later if she knew the Texas pledge and she said, “No,” but that she had memorized it expressly for this ceremony.  I also asked her if she was nervous, and in true Christina fashion, in three very quick sentences, said yes.  Laura rose to sing the national anthem a capella.  Any singer will tell you, no matter what, this is a not a song for the faint of heart to attempt, let alone attempt it a capella.  Laura knocked it out of the park.  I haven’t seen that many grandparents or family members swell up with that much pride in a long, long time.  The crowd was very impressed as well and I try to take advantage of the noise and snap another picture.  My camera reads 25 and does not rewind.    The Lt. Governor, David Dewhurst, is introduced.  I snap a picture and the camera begins to rewind.  The applause does not last as long as I’d like it to and as he’s saying that he liked the anthem so much and that he needs Laura to help him campaign, my camera begins its noisy and lengthy rewind.   Julia has already left the room with Damaris, who just couldn’t sit still or keep quiet that long and I don’t know too many toddlers who would last as long as she did.  So, I’m sitting there alone with a TV camera behind my head and my camera is rewinding.  Thankfully, the acoustics in the room were such that I don’t think that many people actually heard me.  Jene’ was behind me next to the TV camera and she didn’t hear it.  Crisis averted.  Next, the governor gets up and tells us how wonderful Victor is.  He talks about his daughters, Laura, Christina, and then he fumbles around for his notes, because he forgets about Grace.  Grace is over playing on the floor all the way across the chambers, so I did not hear this, but Joy said that as the governor fumbled around for her name, Grace piped up, “And Gracie, too!”    Victor is finally introduced and he begins his speech.  He talks about his humble beginnings, his degrees (I can’t remember them all, but they include geology, geophysics and law), and then he talks about his wife of 18 years, Joy.  Victor tears up, as he often does, because Victor is just really sensitive and caring and most people who know him would be surprised if he didn’t wipe his eyes at least once during such an important milestone in his life.  Victor made it through that and then talked about his parents.  He introduced his family, the parents, the in-laws, the other two RRC’s, Michael Williams (who wears cool bow ties) and Charles Matthews, and his new staff.    Then Victor is sworn in, he exits the platform and the reception begins.  As we wait in line to get through the door to the reception area, Jene’, who is still holding Grant the politician magnet, is approached first by Michael Williams who wants to know if Grant can vote yet.  Then, the Governor and Lt. Governor make their way by to look at the politician magnet.  Grant, still content and quiet, meets the governor.  (By the way, Grant has yet to meet his Daddy, Jeff, who is deployed somewhere in the Persian Gulf – please pray for him!).  At the reception, the Senate photographer keeps taking pictures of Jene’ and Grant.  Jene’ finally asks the photographer who she’s with, and she tells Jene’ these pics will go into the archives and we are all a part of Texas history now.  Grant, before he’s a month old, is now a part of Texas history.  I know he won’t remember this, but his brother told me that Grant is fortunate to see the capitol and experienced all this so early, and that, at 9 years old, he felt as if that was a bit late to get started getting involved in being a part of Texas history.  Grace was not enjoying the reception, and was coaxed by Jene’ to go “do stairs,” to keep her occupied.  After three trips up and down three flights of stairs, Jene’ was done in and Grace seemed satisfied.  They came back just in time for the family parade over to Victor’s new office. I had just been handed the politician magnet, but all the politicians were gone by this time.  When I got outside, my eyes began to water from all the pollen flying through the warm spring air.  After a few blocks, I couldn’t see, so reluctantly, I handed over the baby to his mother.  I figured he would be safer with someone who could actually see the traffic as they crossed the street.  So much for quality time with the little guy who actually got to meet the governor.  Victor’s office is just down the plaza from the capitol building.  We went up to the 12th floor (the top floor) to the RRC suite of offices.  Victor’s office is bigger than, well, my whole apartment.  It has a great view of the capitol building and the rest of Austin.  The bathroom is almost bigger than my bedroom.  Christina excitedly showed me all of the features, the TV with cable and VCR being one of the highlights for her.  Then there were the elephants in the bathroom (elephants, Republicans, get it?).    Joy brings in the lamps for Victor’s office.  She unpacks them and puts the styrofoam packing on the floor.  Grace’s eyes light up as she drags one of the pieces that is larger than she is over to the TV area.  She begins to tear it apart and styrofoam balls go flying everywhere.  Damaris, who sees the “snow” action, decides to join in.  Soon, there was quite a mess on the floor, and I’m sure the custodial staff loves Victor now.  Grace had little styrofoam balls caught in her curly hair, which were stuck there, as Benjamin explained, by static electricity.  	  Soon, it is time to go, so we say our goodbyes, and head to Chuy’s our favorite TexMex place (we have two in Houston as well) and eat lunch/dinner.  It’s 5 p.m. and we are ready to get on the road.  After a quick stop to take my picture in a field of bluebonnets and a short field trip to Wal-Mart in Bastrop, we get home around 9:30, ready to go to BED.  I feel compelled to tell you that Jene’ had parking angels at both Chuy’s and Wal-Mart.  As tired as I still am, I wouldn’t have missed this day for anything.  It’s not every day you get an opportunity like this.  And, in November 2004, I’ll get to vote for Victor.  How often do you get the opportunity to vote for a politician who lives out his faith, and is a person of integrity who actually wants to work hard?   I wish y’all lived here so you could vote for him, and if you knew him, you’d wish that, too.

       SHAE’S GREAT AUSTIN ADVENTURE PART ONE   Helpful terms and definitions:   parking angels  - It doesn’t matter where we go, what time of day it is, or how far away we go, 9 times out of 10, Jene’ will find a good parking spot.  Good, as in within the first five spaces away from the front door.  ***************************************************  It’s the first day of Spring, and on the way to Austin, we see many fields of Texas wild flowers (bluebonnets, Indian paintbrushes, etc) that line Highway 71.   Jene’ suggests that if it’s still daylight when we go back to Houston I should have my picture taken with them.  We get to Austin around 11:40 a.m.  Jene’ is driving and we are on our way to Congress St to find a place to park within walking distance to the State Capitol.    Jene’ calls her sister, Joy, wife of Texas’ newest Railroad Commissioner, Victor, whose swearing in we are in Austin to attend.  Joy is at Jene’s aunt’s house in Austin getting ready for the ceremony.  We have some lamps in our car for Joy, and it is decided it would be easier to drop off the lamps now, rather than after the ceremony, so we go to Jene’s aunt’s house.    Joy, who does not normally care to wear makeup (she last wore makeup on her wedding day 18 years ago), meets us outside for the lamp exchange.  She has applied makeup and her face is too dry and she knows it doesn’t look good.  She also knows Jene’ will be the honest one who will tell her it looks bad and also tell her how to fix it. She asks Jene’ how it looks and Jene’ says, “You look about 10 years older,” and Joy actually looks relieved.  “So should I wash it off?”  Jene’ answers, “Yes, and I know how we can make it look better.”  Jene’ and Joy go upstairs to mix her foundation with moisturizer (Jene’ is like Heloise with attitude) while I say hello to other relatives downstairs. 	 Joy and Victor have three daughters.  Laura, who is 15 and very beautiful, is also an accomplished guitar player, singer and songwriter.  Christina (Nina as she is called by her little sister) is 11 and hides none of her emotions.  You know exactly how Christina feels all the time.  She has a very expressive face and outgoing nature.  Grace is 2 ½  and is a real handful.  She evidently has developed a fear of going places recently.  While Joy is getting her makeup fixed upstairs by Jene’/Heloise, Christina is trying to convince Grace to finish her lunch.  Grace’s clothes have not been changed and her curly hair is sticking out in every direction.  It is after noon by this time and the ceremony begins at 1:30.  Grace sees me and says, “I don’t want to go!”  Everyone else is trying to convince her we’re not really going anywhere, everyone is just dressing up for fun.   Grace then starts this tearful, frustrated exchange with Christina.  	“Nina!  Mommy!” 	Christina picks up Grace to take her upstairs. 	“Nina!  Eat!” 	Christina rolls her eyes in disgust, backs up and puts Grace back in her chair. 	“Nina!  Mommy!” 	“Nina!  Eat!” 	This happens at least three more times, and finally, Christina puts Grace back into her chair and says, “eat, then we’ll go see Mommy.” 	“I don’t want to go!” 	Laura, the teenager, has come downstairs.  She crosses her rams, looks at her baby sister and says, “Grace, you’re going whether you like it or not.” 	“I don’t want to go!”  I retreat upstairs to see how the make over is going.  Jene’ and I soon leave the house and to resume our search for a parking space near the capitol.   Jene’ is silently praying for parking angels (see above) as we drive up Congress St.  After a fruitless search, we turn onto the street in front of the capitol and see a few odd war protest signs.  I’m all for everybody being entitled to express their opinion, but please, for Pete’s sake, at least make your signs and yourself appear somewhat intelligent.  We decide to follow the signs to the parking garage.  Jene’ drives a couple of blocks and says, “I don’t see the signs anymore, so I’m turning.”  As she is turning, I see the sign up the street, so we go to round the block to get back to the parking garage.  On our way back to the main street... a parking spot appears.  It is the second space from the street that runs directly in front of the capitol.  Jene’ smiles and thanks her parking angels as she runs across the street to get change for the parking meter.    Jene’ and I make our way up to the capitol building (not as long of a walk as I had anticipated - thanks parking angels), go through the metal detector and stand in the rotunda and wait to see signs of the rest of her family.  We find a cousin and go upstairs to the senate chambers.    This episode will continue in Part 2 of  Shae’s Great Austin Adventure!

       ORANGE ALERT...   I know our country will be at war within a day or so.  I work at one of the largest churches in Texas, and today, we received a four page booklet entitled, "Contingency Plan," that instructs our staff on the issues of safety during the times of orange alert or higher.   It's really scary that a church would have to have a contingency plan, but we do.  The scariest part is, that the larger places of worship in this country are potential targets of terrorists.  That's a heavy load to have on your mind when you drive to work every day, huh?  If there are threats on any church in our area, I can't take a bag to work, and my purse will have to be searched each time I enter the building.  If a church in the area actually gets hit, our church will be locked down, except for one entrance, and they would actually consider canceling all services and move small groups to offsite meeting places.      The saddest part to me is that they would cancel the services.  I don't attend church where I work.  I have no idea as of yet what my church's contingency plan is.  I just think that the terrorists win when we are too afraid to go to our places of worship... I mean, after all, if we truly believe that we are saved, then if something does happen while we are in church... does it really matter?  I personally believe that if 3,000 people, or even 2 or 3, are gathered praising and worshipping Him, then evil will tremble at the doors.  Please pray for our troops.  I barely remember the Vietnam War, but I do remember that many Americans, in their efforts to protest the war itself, turned their backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend freedom for all.  Even if you do not agree with the war, please pray for those who are courageously performing their duty to defend freedom for all with their own lives.

Basically, I have  Candelorio's Rose  and half of a sequel written.  I am so excited!  Now, I will go back and polish, edit and polish... and then...  I HAVE NO IDEA...   Just kidding!  Pray for me to finish and pray for a publisher!  I have to get back to the book now...

      Last night I completed a six month project that has been essential to my freedom in Christ.  I can't go into all the details, but I have worked through some really tough issues in this group and last night, I "graduated."  I feel so happy and joyful right now, it's tough to describe!  It's been a long time coming, but I feel I am on the brink of something huge.  Just wanted to share that with y'all!  P.S.  My face feels so much better, but my cheek still looks like a mood ring.  Oh, well.  One step at a time!

I can smile without pain and I have weaned myself off the PPM and resorted to ibuprofen -- lots of ibuprofen!    So, it's back to work tomorrow.  I think I should be able to talk all day with little or no trouble.  HOORAY!

       PET PEEVES OF A RECEPTIONIST...IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER   I'm sure I speak for receptionists everywhere.  You know who we are.  We have those earphone thingys jammed in our ears and the microphone thingys make us look as if we should jump up on stage at any moment and start singing.  We are the switchboard operators, the person you call to get transferred to the person with whom you actually wish to speak because you forgot their direct dial number and the switchboard number is just easier to remember.  Hey, that's why we're there.  I came up with this list today because I get frustrated with people who don't know how to behave on the phone and this venting just helped somehow.  Some are serious, some are funny, and ALL have happened to me!  (But not all have happened at the church where I work)  The moral of the story is:  Be nice to the person you’re calling.  Avoid the following and you are likely to get transferred to the person/department you actually want instead of a random recording.		   X)  When you call while you’re getting out of your car please (I'm begging you)  first  remove your keys from the ignition… I can hear that beep, too, and because I have an earphone thingy jammed into my ear, it's usually louder than you think.   X)  If your kids are screaming in your ear… they’re screaming into mine, too, and see above about the earphone thingy.   X)  Please, please, please, turn down your radio before you make your call... and see above about the earphone thingy.   X)  Don’t continue a conversation with someone else while you are waiting for me to answer. Chances are, you’ll still be talking when I answer and when I start talking you won’t hear me.  Thus confusion ensues for you and frustration ensues for me.   X)  If you’re in your car and it’s raining really hard… not only should you NOT be using your phone and  driving … I won’t be able to hear you over the pounding rain.  Remember, when you call me, I have that earphone thingy jammed in my ear... blah, blah, blah.   X)  Speaker phones are really annoying and you sound like you are at the end of a tunnel and probably drunk.   X)  Know   what, who, why and what   you are calling for  before  you dial my number.  Be concise and  to the point .  I do not need your life’s story.  I do not need to know that you knew so and so on staff when they were in college, that your dog just did a no no on the floor, or how many cuss words you know.  All I require are  the reasons you called for in the first place .  The four people after you waiting for me to answer their call don't want to know your life story either.   X)  For most companies who have multi-line phone systems, the company’s main number is likely the one that will show up on caller ID. If the person who called did not leave a message, please don’t call the number and ask who called you from that number. The receptionist will not know and since the person didn’t leave a message, you are wasting everyone’s time.  Yelling at the receptionist for not knowing which person on a staff of 250 called you will not help.  If it really means that much to you, call Dionne and her psychic friends and then call me back.   X)  Please... try to finish chewing before I answer and please wait to clear your throat until you hear the hold music.   Earphone thingy jammed in my ear...you know the rest.   X)  Please, please,  please  understand that Mr. Gehpaidtumutch is not sitting at his desk waiting for you to call him and neither is his secretary Yesther Fakke.  People do get up to go to the bathroom.  They have meetings.  They eat lunch.  They talk to  other  people on the phone.   Get over it.   Voice mail is your friend. Leave a message there. Embrace the technology.   X)  I'm  begging  you... make sure you  know  you are dialing a fax machine before you push the  go  button.  The blood running out of my ear after receiving a fax call is just not attractive.  Remember, most receptionists have that earphone thingy...   X)  Please don't wait for me to answer and then hang up in my ear if you think I've taken too long to answer the phone then call back 10 seconds later to prove your point.     X)   Lo siento no habla Espanol  and I haven't learned it since the last time you called.     And, while I'm at it, let me add some of the odd calls I've gotten since being a receptionist at a rather large Southern Baptist church.  You learn a lot from people on a certain "wavelength."  For example:    -  Virgins have supernatural power .  One lady (who calls often and more than one of these are hers) called and said that she needed prayer because she was a virgin and she wanted to have children someday and that wasn't going to happen if she went to jail... because... the knife only missed the bad drunk man by inches and the knife was still stuck in the door.  She was afraid because virgins have supernatural power and she would probably hurt him eventually and therefore never have children.  (Don't worry, this woman is institutionalized and isn't where she can actually hurts people... the thing is... we're not sure how she gets to a phone).  -  God knows where the Windows XP recovery disk is and I should ask him and report back .  A lady called and asked me to pray and ask God to help her find the Windows XP recovery disk she had misplaced.  She said I should ask God where is was and get back to her when he told me.  Then she hung up without giving me her phone number.  Of course, God hasn't told me where it is yet, so I guess having the number wouldn't help.    -  George W. Bush is a Nazi .  After all, his book  was  next to the one with the swastika on it at Borders.  -  What, are we  neutral  now?   The moral of the story is... don't fly white wedding flags during a war.  There was a major wedding at the church the weekend after the Iraqi War started.  One of the things that you can do is fly white flags down the main sidewalk as a part of your wedding decor.  I'm not kidding, more than one person called and asked if the church had taken a neutral position on the war and they were outraged.  Even after I explained the whole wedding bit these people were not satisfied.  Finally I just said they were for lent and people shut up.  Baptists don't do lent, but apparently a spiritual explanation is better than a nupital one.  -  Censor, in a Way (35 Across)  One morning, a little old man sitting at a table doing crosswords with his friends at Wal-Mart called me and asked me a crossword question -- after all, receptionists apparently know  everything .    I could go on and on... I have so many stories.  Perhaps someday I should write  The Receptionist Diaries  or something...

       A PRINCESS DIARY ENTRY:   Okay, so I watched this charming little movie tonight called  The Princess Diaries .  I totally identified with Mia, the poor, unfortunate klutz with bushy hair and thick eyebrows (think the daughter of Groucho Marx and Brooke Shields) who finds out she's really a  princess .  If you've seen it, then you'll understand why I roared with laughter when, at a fancy schmancy dinner with too many forks of various sizes and costly breakable dinnerware, Mia accidentally sets the person next to her on  fire .  My other favorite scene was when Mia tried to put on pantyhose on in the back of the limo.  Yes, I totally identify with the teenage klutz, only I am not now a princess of a small insignificant European country that is famous for its pears.  Hmm...   And now, other musings:   I once prayed with a young woman who was concerned about her husband, who, though raised in the church, had now stated he no longer believes in God.  Personally, I cannot imagine saying, "'Til death do us part," with someone and then have them say, two years down the road,  "oh, by the way, I don't believe in God anymore."   The tears this young woman shed ( young 20's ) as she told me her story made my heart heavy.  She was committed to staying with him, praying for him, and hanging in there with him.  She was really hurting, and though I prayed with her, I know her heart still had to hurt because she could not see the light at the end of the tunnel.    Have you ever left a wedding and known that "God did that," or have you left and felt as if you've wasted an afternoon?  I've seen many people I care about (who said the Christian aspect and God's will, of course, was paramount) get married to "Christians" (see #4 from previous post) and reap much sorrow.  Some gave up on the Christian aspect all together and married  the man that asked , regardless of his spirituality or lack thereof.  In love with being in love and not necessarily the person they married, the idea of getting married somehow threw off and overpowered their true spiritual radar and led them down the aisle of regret rather than down the aisle of celebration.  I don't know if this was the case of the young lady I prayed with or not.  I do know, however, when I finished praying with her, I appreciated my singleness that much more.   I would rather be happy and single than miserably married .  Granted, when I was 25 I said that begrudgingly and with many tears... but at 34 I can now say it with a smile on my face and  mean it  wholeheartedly.  I truly admire married people who are in God's will and make the whole marriage thing work.  You know who they are... their wedding was a celebration, but more than that, they prepared for the marriage much harder and longer than they did for the wedding day itself.  They are the married couple you make your boyfriend spend time with so he sees "how it's really done."  They are the couple you most love to see fight so you can take notes on how they resolved the conflict and how they stayed married after Chuck forgot to bring the loaf of bread home after work (again).  They are the couple you love to see discipline their children, manage their finances, run their home and take that cross-country vacation in the car with  all of their children  and enjoy the trip or at least live to tell about it.  They are the couple that gently reminds you that the whole marriage thing is  work , but it's fun, frustrating and rewarding work.  I could write paragraph after paragraph about the accountability I have in this area (and many others), but I will just write one.   All of us need accountability.   If you start dating someone and you can't or won't take him to meet the people who hold you accountable, BIG FAT RED FLAG #1.  If your best friend says, "What the crack are you thinking?" when she meets him -- BIG FAT RED FLAG #2.   If you compare this man to one half of your favorite godly married couple and he not only falls short, he falls off, BIG FAT RED FLAG #3.  If you even get this far, you have to ask yourself:   Is this guy worth it?   Because, let me tell you, if he's a red flag after red flag and you ignore all the red flags because you think it's better to be married to a red flag than be single, you will be married and miserable and very lonely... because while people will be there for you no matter what, they may not stick around to watch you willingly self destruct.    Take it from this singleton:  No red flag is worth it (and believe me, I've considered one red flag too many).  I can say this with all honesty -- I would rather be single and happy and free from the sorrow of a bad marriage than miserably married.  I declare this often to many young people and will preach it from the rooftops even after I'm married to the man who exceeds comparisons to one half of my favorite godly married couple.

       RULES FOR EASTER CANDY    Rule #1    Don't leave the Easter basket sitting on the coffee table and leave the blinds open, too.   Rule #2    Don't eat all your jelly beans at once. (Smucker's jelly beans are really good but those green apple and orange ones are  tart ).   Rule #3    Don't go buy more Easter candy just because it's on sale (i.e. dark chocolate Hershey hugs...)   Rule #4    Anything choclate made in the shape of an animal is cute, but usually doesn't taste as good as it looks.   Rule #5    Peeps.  Just say  no .  I have a tummy ache...

       BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLOG...    There is a kind of doctrinaire aspect sometimes to being a Christian that the message is more important than the ways you go about doing it. And you always suspect that there’s not the same level of art as in people who actually are people of faith who also practice fiction. I think Jesus would have wanted us to be good writers as well and pay attention to our craft as well as tell a meaningful story.      Ron Hansen, on problem with 'Christian' fiction, DSS Interview February 7th, 2003    I have pondered this quote for a few days. It struck a chord in me.  One of the reasons I backed off from working in the Christian music industry (now don't flood me with "you're a blasphemer" comments... hear me out), was the lack of anything original being produced.  In the early 90's, besides Jars of Clay and DC Talk, most Christian music was a copy of something that had already been produced outside of the Christian subculture.  I suppose only diehard musicians/music lovers, poets and painters really pay attention to originality or quality of the music and art that surrounds them.  Many people accept a quality of art that is way, way subpar.  Christ was not a copy, he was the original.  He was fresh, new, controversial, anti-legalistic, and (gasp)  cutting edge .   I think that should be the model we follow as Christians when we create.     Sometimes, this means leaving the Christian "label" behind.  Did Christ label everything in his parables as Christian?  Did he talk about the  Christian  sower who sowed his  Christian  seed in the  secular  thorn bushes?  No.  He spoke of everyday things, even things we would not consider holy.  He did not distinguish between sacred or secular because to him, everything was sacred, because he made it.  It's his creation that has corrupted the rest of his creation.   Think about it this way:   When you have leaky plumbing in your house, do you search for a Christian plumber?  No, you want the  best  plumber - the one that is going to get the leak stopped once and for all.  When you want the best steak in town, do you look for a Christian steak house?  No, you go to the place that has the best reputation for making the best steak.    I know many kids (and adults) that love music, art and literature, who do not turn down the Christian music aisle to get the best, most creative, freshest, cutting-edge music.  They do not turn to the Christian fiction section when they want something exciting and challenging to read and they do not shop in the T-shirt section at the local Christian Book Store to buy the latest fashions (after all, most Christian T-shirts are Christianized copies of T-shirts already produced elsewhere).  I know many Christians who see this as a huge problem, as well they should.  They, however, see the problem as these kids wandered outside their Christian subculture and have been tainted.  I see it as these kids wandered outside their Christian subculture and were  freed.   These kids will grow up, eager to make their art, music, literature, and even clothes and plumbing cutting edge.  They will make art relevant to those Christians are supposed to be trying to reach, instead of creating art, music and literature to discuss amongst themselves.  Unfortunately, many Christians will try to label them as secular, blasphemers, backsliders, and heretics and totally miss the point.  Don't get me wrong.  I do listen to Christian music sometimes.  Much of it over the years has encouraged me, uplifted me, brought me closer to God and made me feel better.  Very little of it, however, has satisfied the musician in me, the artist in me, or the poet in me. Very little of it has challenged me, either.  That is why so many people find it boring and turn elsewhere to be challenged and satisfied.   It's also hard to relate to those outside the Christian subculture if your creative diet is labeled 100% Christian.    Think of it... how many times have you been talking to a non-Christian, trying to tell him what your music sounds like and you always have to compare it to a group or artist outside the Christian subculture anyway so it's  relevant to them?    "Well, this group is really cool.  They sound like the Backstreet Boys."  Exactly.  The group you are speaking of were made as an "alternative" to and  in the image of  the Backstreet Boys, which isn't necessarily bad in itself, it's just not fresh.   Fresh lasts longer .  Something that is a copy is already going stale and the original will last much longer than the copy.  Something -- anything -- that is labeled Christian should not leave you wanting, longing, unsatisfied.  The thing that bugs me is that most things labeled Christian leave me wanting, longing and unsatisfied.    I know many Christians who do excellent work.  David is an auto mechanic and he is one of the best around.  I do not recommend him, however, because David happens to be a Christian.  I recommend him because he is a great mechanic (and because he's a Christian, I know he will treat them honestly and with respect).  My friend Angie is a great photographer.  I would recommend her to anybody if they wanted creative, meaningful pictures.  Angie is very creative and gifted and I would recommend her over and over again.  The fact that Angie is also a Christian is just the icing on the cake and I know someday her art and her creativity will open up doors for her to share her faith with others.  My friend Jene' is a great designer and I would also recommend her in a heartbeat.  She is also a Christian.  My friend Jamie is an artist and has had her work displayed on the cover of published work.  I would also recommend her.  She is also a Christian.  I would not, however, recommend any of these people because they are Christians.  I would recommend them  because they do excellent work .    One too many times I have recommended a Christian friend to do a job and they did the job very, very poorly (and some under the excuse of, "but at least I'm a Christian").  They expected the Christian label to be enough.    It isn't.    Personally, I know that when I meet someone as a writer, more doors open for me to share the gospel than if I meet someone as a Christian writer.   Funny how that works.   My challenge today is this:   Christians should be the model, the example, the template -- not the copy.  The art, music, plumbing, photography, whatever it is... should be so good that people want to study it, use it, discuss it, and copy it - regardless of it's spiritual implications.  To do this, I believe, Christians need to think, work, act, play, and fix pipes outside the Christian subculture so that someone who is not a Christian actually sees, hears, reads, and uses what Christians produce.  If the art, (etc) is good enough, it will meet a need, whether it's emotional, physical, mental  or  spiritual.  I believe this is where the door opens for discussion -- and this is where Christians have the opportunity to impact the world  around  them.    I think about this -- all of this -- as I write and create.  I hope that my art will impact those around me and be relevant to those who wouldn't necessarily shop at a Christian Bookstore.  I don't want to be on the Christian Fiction shelf at any bookstore.  I want people besides Christians to read my book(s).  I am not writing for those who already know Christ.  I am writing more for those that don't and if what I do or create is meaningful and challenging to a Christian, that's definitely a bonus, but not my goal.    Ok... that's my rant for the day.  It's been on my mind for a few days.  It stems from a conversation with other Christians who don't understand why I went back and re-wrote my book to be more raw and edgy and real.  I tried to explain that life is, even for the Christian, raw and edgy and real.  They were offended.  I was more determined than ever to be the original... the template.  I may not get there on my first try, but I will eventually.  I'm not afraid to try.   I had a great Teacher.

       AH, A GOOD FRIDAY...  It's nearly three o'clock in the afternoon and I'm  still in my PJ's .  Even though I am not getting paid for this day off, I am really enjoying myself.  I'm reading an assortment of things, blogs, my Artist's Way book (if I could ever just get my morning pages done, maybe this writer's block would go away), and I'm catching up on correspondence -- the old fashioned kind -- you know, the kind that involves ink, paper, stamps and envelopes.  Writing letters to people over 90 is rewarding.  My Great Aunt is now 95.  She offers such a great perspective on life, and though her daugher has to write her letters for her now, I get great encouragement from her.  She was one of the first Christians on my mom's side of the family.  She was also one of the first rebels of the faith I ever knew.  She and my grandmother (her sister) were a riot when they were in their 20's.  I love reminiscing with her though she's in Indiana and I'm in Texas.  Yes, I will have to blog about Aunt Edna soon.  Jene' and I are going out for some TexMex food tonight.  Chuy's... yum.  I have the world's most frugal and generous roommate (she buys me dinner frequently).  She gets the most bang for her buck on all of her big purchases (the most recent being a printer) and she saves up the money in advance.  I admire her patience and commitment to staying out of debt.  My debt has been a shackle to me as I have tried to serve God (and compared to most people, I am  way  below the average with the amount of my debt).  It's hard to work for struggling ministries when you have bills.  I encourage everyone I can (especially the college students I have the joy to know at church) to avoid credit cards and debt at all costs.  They are free to leave all they know behind and go to China, Belize, the Sudan -- anywhere -- because they are not tied to paying bills like I am.  Someday, I will get back to that point.  Meanwhile, I work, I keep trying to finish that novel, and I blog.  On a good note, I am working every day next week, but I should be finished with the one job by then.  Then, back to the drawing board.  I am grateful, though, for God's provision thus far.  After all, I've been gainfully  semi-unemployed  (see definition on April 8th) for three years now and I've yet to starve or be homeless.    I must get some writing done before I go to Chuy's... so I will blog later.  Have a good weekend, and remember the reason we all had the day off today.

       ONE DAY AT A TIME   I just worked 19 hours in two days, so that makes up for part of the time I missed the last two weeks.  I also picked up a little work at First so I will be working every day next week.  That will extend my time to look for a job for at least a week.  I hope to pick up more work for a week or two, but will not hold my breath.  I'm just thankful for the extra week.     For the resume' I have to come up with an "objective" aka "mission statement."  That has been a unique challenge.  How do you delicately phrase this?  "Well, see, I just want to work for you to pay my bills so I can steal whatever time I can for my writing pursuits, which by the way, is what I deeply feel I was put on this earth to do, not answer your phone, type your letters and put up with your mood swings."  HA!  Yeah, I'd get hired in a heartbeat.  Therefore, other than the mission statement, I am finished with the bulk of the dreaded resume'.  Meanwhile, I have been trying to polish the book as quickly as I can, but even if it was done tomorrow, I'd be weeks from publishing (if it's that good).   Timing... timing... timing...  Only God knows.  Until later, Bloggers!

       RESUME' BLUES   My fingertips are all black and smudgy from perusing the newspaper, but so far, it's pretty slim pickins... Most of the "receptionists" nowadays double as accounts payable clerks, janitors and bookkeepers.  Times are so tight that employers want one person for two jobs and less pay, which I understand, but it just makes things tougher for me.  I turned to the internet job search and am finding the same thing.  I may just have to go work at Target and learn to scan things.  (I am comic relief at the grocery store in the U-Scan Line.  Imagine me repeating my mantra, "U-Scan?  Sure can!" and then have the computer mock me by saying, "Please scan again.")  At least at Target I won't have to do bookkeeping and the cash register calculates your change (although I'm really good at that for some reason).  And...I can still encounter the same calibur of weirdos as I do on the phone at First Baptist, only this time live and in person!  (I may have to post some of  those  stories...)  Target is sounding more appealing all the time.  Ah, the resume'... Another job search tool that I have not had to utilize in 17 years of job searching.  Jene' is going to help me tweak my resume' so what I do sounds important, vital, and interesting even though it's usually boring, mundane and I could do it all in my sleep.  I will list my skills, and I have many, but I will not include, "can balance broomstick on ample Bavarian nose," or "can name every war correspondent on Fox News."  Jene' also says it's never too late to develop people skills - because someday I'll be a mother of teenagers and the ability to persuade stubborn people to do my bidding will come in handy whether or not I ever get another job.  So... I am going to work on the resume' so Jene' can tweak it tonight.  It's a cold (62), windy day in Houston, so it's a good day to stay indoors and accomplish lots of stuff.  I'm also still sick and congested, and my equilibrium is shot, so it's probably a good thing that I am sitting down and not walking around outside and wobbling -- people might think I'm drunk.  I'll take my cola out of the bag when I go outside.  That should help that rumor... ha ha...  Resume' calls... I will keep you posted as I re-navigate "semi-unemployment."     Definition:    semi-unemployment  - the state of having only enough hours to keep a person from being classified, "unemployed," yet not having enough money to pay even the tiniest of bills.  Semi-unemployment gives the worker enough confidence that perhaps she isn't totally unemployable and gets her out of the house enough to avoid severe depression over state of employment-ness.

       ADVENTURES OF THE "BETWEEN JOB BLONDE"   Once again, for the umpteenth time since January 2000, I find myself, "between jobs."  Well, I still have one part time job, Monday & Friday at the switchboard at First Baptist, but that will barely cover my rent.  The other part time job that filled in the rest of my work week ended April 1st (no foolin') because of budget cuts.  The department I worked for just doesn't have it in the budget for part time work any more.  The rest of the church is cutting corners on everything, so I think my tenure there is about to come to an end.    The only reason I'm sad about this is that I had a vacation planned in June.  My first vacation in 7 years -- a week on the beach on South Padre' Island.  After the stress of the last three years, I was really looking forward to it.  I was going to really relax and decide what future I wanted my employed life to take, but now, I am flying by the seat of my pants again.    I will keep you posted as this current episode unfolds...  as for the book, I guess now I will have some more time for it as I fold it in between trying to find a job and trying to find a job.  I really do see the humor in all this, but I'm ready for some job stability.  Any suggestions?  lol...

       BYE, BYE, BYE...   Of course, we are not leaving town at the time we planned, but we'll hopefully get out of town before RUSH HOUR.  Jene' at Enterprise picking up the car and will be home shortly.  I still have to cool down from the drive home (it's 98 degrees right now with a heat index of 101 degrees, BUT it's only 30% humidity, so it's not quite the sauna today) so I can even entertain the thought of eating lunch.  We also have to clean out Jene's car before we leave... they are towing it away today.  (sniff, sniff)  Wait... now it's 99 degrees.  This is not typical May weather, even for Houston.  It hasn't rained since EASTER Sunday.  This weather is August weather and this does not bode well for the rest of the summer.  By the time I'm finished with this blog, I do not doubt it will be 100 degrees.  Pray for us while we are on the road!  We have a six hour drive to San Angelo, and it's a steady incline all six hours so my ears will be popping!  Houston is below sea level... San Angelo is not... you get the picture.  Pray that the other drivers will be paying attention as we drive!  Talk to y'all later...

       CRASH! BANG! BOOM!   ... was what I heard and witnessed as a silver Saturn hit my roommate's car last night.  I was following her in my car (we had met somewhere and I was following her home).  I won't bore you with all the details, but she was turning right onto an eight lane street (4 each way).  I was watching her turn... a habit I have had for nearly 15 years, because my little brother was notorious in high school for hitting people from behind because he saw them start to turn, then rear ended them because they stopped and he was already looking at oncoming traffic for his opportunity to peel out... I mean,  turn .  So, I got into the habit of watching and waiting until the person in front of me is gone before I take my turn.   Anyway, after Jene' had completed the turn and was fully in the lane and a good car length or so down the street, a woman hit her from the lane next to her on her driver's side.   The bang was so loud, and I saw Jene's driver's side get hit and then she got knocked up on the sidewalk and came to a very abrupt halt.  I didn't know if her car had been hit in the door or fender and my entire body tensed up (I have sympathy whiplash, lol) because I thought she had been hit mortally (I know,  drama, drama, drama ).  Then, as I turned into the parking lot next to the sidewalk where Jene's car had come to a stop, she got out of her car so I could see she was okay.  I started breathing again.   Jene's front left fender was smashed and the other car's front right headlight and hood was damaged.  At the angle the damage suggested, the woman entered the lane Jene' had already occupied.  Jene' said the woman's silver Saturn was not in her lane when she turned.  I believe her.  I did not see that part.  I was watching my roommate turn as per my habit and it would be very awkward to run into the back of your roommate's car because you weren't paying attention... so whenever I am following her I pay extra special attention.   Here's where the story turns UGLY.  I knew when the woman got out of her car Jene' was hosed... silver Saturn woman was tall, thin, blonde and had big  u know what's .  Jene' asked her (she's a nurse, she has to) if she was injured, and the girl said, "so you are saying this is your fault!" which told me she already knew she was wrong (there are other juicy details, but I will not post them...).  Her version, however, stated that she was in the far lane and Jene' was pulling out and she hit her  while Jene' was turning  and that she "tried to get out of the way as best she could." Ahem...the damage (and even if I hadn't been there to see that Jene' had already completed her turn and was already down the street over a car length) said otherwise.     Silver Saturn woman called the cops at 5:30, about fifteen minutes into exchanging policy numbers and phoning insurance companies and after Jene' wouldn't admit fault.  Jene' and I hadn't really discussed what happened, I asked her if she was okay and I told her that I didn't see where the silver Saturn had been, I just saw where it ended up and what it did to Jene'.  Then I went and sat in the shade by my car and since I felt left out of the phone call marathon, I called Amy and told her what happened and to have my small group pray and then I called Elizabeth, who laughs at me when I'm stressed and talking and venting and her laugh makes me laugh...  We waited over an hour for Houston's finest.  The silver Saturn woman kept saying that she was behind Jene' and tried to get out of the way but couldn't get stopped.  Get out of the way?   Well, I decided that since I had my camera with me I should use it, so I handed it to Jene' and let  her  take pics.  :p The silver Saturn woman got back into her car, put up her windows and got on the phone again.  About twenty minutes later, a man about her age (she was in her mid twenties) shows up with a camera, which I thought was funny.  If she uses those pics, they could work against her...   Houston's finest show up at 6:38 p.m.  Two nice,  young  officers.  Jene' and I looked at each other.  We knew how this was going to go. Though both of us are well endowed (lol) we are not tall, (well Jene' isn't) and neither one of us is a skinnie minnie.  To make it an even better experience than it already was, they even ticketed Jene', because the girl's statement was that she hit Jene' as Jene' was turning and  the law says that if you are leaving a stop sign or light and are involved in a wreck  (they also said that all four lanes have to be clear before you pull out, according to the law, to not get ticketed if a wreck happens)  you get a ticket .    If there's one thing I've learned from Jene', it's that no matter how much you are being hosed in any given situation, sometimes it's better to keep your sarcastic mouth shut, so I did (esp. when the hose-er has a badge and a car with pretty lights on top).   It was quite obvious to me that the police did not believe me.  Yes, I am Jene's roommate and yes, she's my best friend, but what they don't realize is that Jene' does not lie... not about her age, her hair color, her weight, ANYTHING.  Jene' told me that all she wanted me to say was what I saw, which is what I intended from the beginning anyway.  I cannot lie creatively under pressure anyway (lol... just kidding) and the truth is the best route, because you can remember the truth, but it's always tough to keep your lies straight.  Silver Saturn woman will learn, even if not an outcome of this situation, that the truth will set you free.     Policeman A took my statement, and as the ONLY witness, it struck me as odd that he listened to me for less than thirty seconds and didn't write anything down.  Then Policeman B (a trainee who was taking orders from A) took my license number and he wrote down one sentence, that I said that the turn had been completed and she was more than a car length down the street.  Then, A & B explain that they are giving Jene' a ticket and yes, she's getting shafted, but that's what the law says, blah, blah, blah. Again, I keep my sarcastic mouth shut and count to ten.  Jene' handles herself as she always does... calmly, with deep breaths and a look of resolution on her face.  I knew this would not be handled on the street but later with the insurance people.    Ah, the lovely insurance people.  I have nothing but good things to say about Geico... Jene's company.  They were nice, thorough and explained everything quite nicely.  Now, Progressive, who represented the silver Saturn woman tried to twist every word I said.  The man treated me like a dumb woman. In a very patronizing tone he said, when I told him I was watching my roommate turn... "Are you sure?  Because we all know NOBODY watches a car turn, they pull up and are looking the other way to see when  they  can turn."  I said no and repeated myself and he sighed.  Hey, what can I say, I'm unusual.  And then, to make my testimony more convincing, when he asked me what kind of police showed up (what kind of question is that?) ...I was tired, and I hadn't eaten and this guy was ON MY LAST NERVE so I asked Jene', "It was HPD, right, not Metro..." and she looked like she didn't hear me and I laughed and said, "No, it was the one's in the blue car, so it was HPD." They have me on tape saying this. Yeah.  So I sound like a  dumb  roommate to top it all off.   Oh, the joys of car wrecks...And what does my roommate have to say about all this?  "That's life."  I was more angry on her behalf at the injustice of it all, but like she said, if she's not upset then I can't be...lol... and as Mary Ann said today, "there's no grace in that."  All day people asked me what I thought God was trying to teach  her  (I could detail the calamities of last three years for both of us and we could both legally change our names to JOB, but Jene' more than me).   I told Jene' that it's all my fault (kidding) because it's what God's trying to teach  me  that  I'm  not getting... because, obviously she's getting it ("that's life").  I'm calmer tonight.  If I had blogged last night there would have been a gratuitous use of some words and way too much drama... but I realized today that Jene' has the right idea.  Again this goes back to her parenting, (read previous blog).   She's found so many silver linings today (even after the ins. adjuster declared her car totalled, and her car being an older, she will get NOTHING for it -- thus leaving her car-less) that she could  forge a ring .  Nobody got hurt, her car is just a thing, I kept my sarcastic mouth shut, etc...  Things happen.  We may never know why bad things happen to good people...again... and again...and again... but they do.  What can you do?  Like Jene' often tells me when I'm mid-rant --  why waste energy over something you have no control over and cannot change?   In mid rant... I have to stop and admit to myself she's right and not finish my beautifully sarcastic and witty rant.  UGH.   Is God sovereign or isn't He?  Is God in control or isn't He?  Can God provide or can't He?   Now, before you draw a halo over Jene's picture... she's not dancing around the apartment (she's too sore anyway) rejoicing over her loss.  She's not calling people and telling them in a joyful tone, "Praise the Lord!  Guess what!  Today the  funniest  thing happened... this tall, perky blonde girl hit me and her story doesn't match up and my car is totalled... and I'm  so happy  that I don't have a car anymore and between the two of us the car with air conditioning is now gone and I'm so happy!! WOO HOO!!"  No, she's not happy, but, as she just told me, "The old lady just can't waste any time on this."  And (blankety blank), she's right.   So, I'll end with that and give you a few helpful hints about what to do in case of/or to prevent/or to prepare for an accident...        *     First and foremost, always  watch the car in front of you  turn to make sure they are out of your way.  It's just smart driving.  Just ask my brother.      *     Put a  disposable camera  in your glove box for such a time as this... or in case you see Elvis pumping gas off Hwy 36 at 3 a.m.      *     If you are in an accident and you don't look like a runway model but the person who hit you  does ,  prepare to be hosed .  Just know it's going to happen.  Be calm.  Fight another day.  If you look like a runway model -- praise God and don't use your looks to be deceitful.  Remember, the truth will set you free and you need to know this because one day you won't look like a runway model and you need to know how to act when that time comes... because even if you aren't ready to admit your hoochie days are over  but everyone else can plainly see they are , it won't matter what you think.      *      The car really is  just a THING  .  I was driving a buddy's car (about a year and a half ago) and a sixteen year old kid hit me, and promptly admitted it to his insurance company (then I spent fifteen minutes on the phone with his mother trying to convince her he was indeed okay).  I called my buddy to tell him about his car and I expected at least a little anger, blame,  something  (from past experience with others) and all he said was, "Are you okay? As long as you're okay, that's all I care about.  The car doesn't matter."  Though I should have trusted my friend's character and known he would have reacted that way, that response really taught me something.  Jene's actions over the past two day only reinforced that it's just a car.        *      It's not about me.  It's not about Jene'.  It's about God...  and she's been able to say, "Well, I'm just going to trust God," and be a light to an insurance agent.  FOCUS.   Jene' is renting a car to drive to West Texas tomorrow... and I'll keep you posted.  If life lessons keep happening at this rate and I actually keep paying attention... I might have to check and see if my soul has stretch marks.  (Yeah, I'm wondering how one goes about that, too).

       A GIVING LEGACY   My roommate is  amazing .  Jene' does so much against incredible adversity... and yet she would be the first to say, "that's life."  I could list her adversities, but they are not important to the story.  We all have our adversity.  Granted, she has more adversity than most people I know, but she lives in such a way that most people forget what she's up against, and that's how Jene' wants it.    The important part of her story is what she does  in spite of  her adversities.  Take today for example.  Jene' volunteers for  Lifehouse , an organization that helps young, unwed mothers.  Jene' (a nurse) volunteers as a birthing coach for these teenage girls.  Jene' took over the holiday weekend shift because the volunteer on duty had a family emergency.  While I slept, Jene' left and one baby was delivered.  She came home, slept about an hour and in her delirium had a dream that I had eloped and left her a note on my bed and did not say who I was eloping with (since I am not dating, I don't know who that would be either).  I just had to throw that in... and I claim it as prophecy.  Anyway, I heard her leave again right around 10 a.m.  This particular 15 year old had gone into labor 2 months early.  By the time it was all said and done and the doctors had done everything they could, Jene' ended up holding the baby boy until he quit breathing.    To be honest with you, I don't know if I could have done what she did without completely falling to pieces.  She came home, very tired, and tearfully relayed the story to me.  I cried, too, knowing how much she had to be hurting physically, emotionally and not to put too fine a point on it, spiritually.  There are some things on this earth that I'll never be able to wrap my brain around, and I know this was one of those moments for both of us, but especially Jene'.    Hopefully, she's sleeping now, resting up to go back to work tomorrow.    I realized today why Jene' can give so much, and why some people like me have difficulty with even simple ways to give.  Jene's "give" tank has been filled constantly since she was born.  She was told there wasn't anything she couldn't do by parents who not only believed that, but embodied that belief in everything they did themselves.  Jene' was taught life skills, coping skills, loving skills and  giving  skills by the people who brought her into this world.  They prepared her for life by preparing her to give back, and I realized today my give tank level is horrendously low.  One reason is because I have given a tremendous amount, but the problem is, I haven't stopped to figure out how to refill it.  I have also realized that the way I learned to give is in total detriment to self, a martyr style of service -- that was my model.  I also was never taught how to receive, but that's another blog.    I will not turn this into a pity party.  I don't feel sorry for myself, I've simply had this epiphany.  I used to compare myself with Jene' a lot in this area of giving and wondered how she could do so much, and now I know why.  The deficiency in my give tank isn't an excuse not to serve, but it brings some things into focus for me.  I realize why some people get burned out.  Sometimes, it's a balance issue, when some people don't rest or give back to themselves or an avoidance issue -- busy-ness rather than facing issues in their own lives. At other times, people who were raised in the martyr style of giving wear themselves out and never discover the joy of giving and therefore burn out easily.   I now know why, however, that some balanced, healthy people get burned out.  Their give tanks either were never full to begin with or they emptied their tanks without knowing how to refill them.   I'm not saying Jene' never gets tired or burns out, but she knows how to refill her give tank and she knows how to rest.  She was not born with this quality, she  learned/absorbed  these skills from two people I am also proud to call family -- her parents.    Do I throw up my hands and say, "it's too late!"  No.  It's never to late to learn giving skills and fill up a give tank.  The best way to learn is to surround yourself with people who have these skills and give of them freely, watch, learn, and then DO WHAT THEY DO.  It's a proven pattern of learning in other areas of life.  It seems silly, doesn't it?   Learning  how to give?  Giving should be as natural as breathing, right?  Trouble is, most people are centered inward, and giving is always centered outward.  Not only is our nature centered inward, if we are not taught or shown how to give, then we won't.  It's that simple.   Jene' has blessed others because she continues her family's legacy of giving.  If I ignore this opportunity to learn and fill my give tank (and all other tanks for that matter), I'd be a fool, (and I don't suffer fools gladly).  With God, there are no accidents --of timing, placement, proximity or otherwise -- it's just sometimes I walk around with my eyes closed and my ears plugged.  And heaven help the person whose give tank overflows... what a waste.  I don't see that happening in Jene's family --  ever .    Sleep well, Jene'.

       YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN...   ...you start referring to yourself as the Princess of  Shaenovia .  I think I've watched  The Princess Diaries  one too many times!  It also proves I don't have much of a social life... ha ha... but it's very rare that a movie can make me laugh out loud even after I've watched it this many times!  All right then.  Now that you know all about my secret identity, you don't have to bow the next time you see me.  If you see a really cool tiara on sale anywhere, though, let me know.     Item one:   No one interrupted or disturbed my sacred Saturday morning.  Starts off my extended weekend well.   Item two:   I did laundry today in my  jammies.    Item three:   There's nothing on television on a holiday weekend... except  The Princess Diaries  and some sports.   Item four:   My roommate's nap has lasted for a few hours and it's time for me to go check for a pulse.  Well, that's the extent of my exciting day.  A day in the life of the Princess of Shaenovia... I think my kingdom would be more fun if I had some royal subjects.  I need to go recruiting!  I promise my next entry will be more exciting and insightful.  My brain is mush today!

       RUBEN! RUBEN!   I've watched only two episodes of  American Idol ... and I'm addicted.  I  knew  it would happen... which is why I didn't watch it before now.  I watched last night and I watched the last 15 minutes tonight.  Ruben is struggling through his big solo, but I can understand he's very emotional... I'm not sure I could sing at that point either.  Last night, he was like buttah.  I will still buy his CD.  I'm so sad it's over...

       SACRED SATURDAY SLEEP-INS   If you've known me for very long, you know that Saturday mornings before 11 a.m.... well, let's just say it's my sacred time.  I'm often up late on Fridays and I like to sleep in.  I like to wake up lazily and read before I get out of bed.  I like to stay in my jammies (and do laundry - ha!) as long as possible.  It's the one day I schedule nothing until at least noon.  Down time.  Me time.  Zzzzzz time.  This morning, at  8:26 a.m.,  there was a light knocking at the door, which became a hard, obnoxious knock at 8:27 a.m.  I stumbled downstairs and opened the door.  The two guys from the Salvation Army had arrived to pick up the broken washing machine we were discarding.  Originally, we were supposed to call them between 8 - 8:30 a.m. to find out when we were scheduled for pickup, which obviously hadn't happened.  Apparently, we were scheduled for pickup at 8:26 a.m.    I remembered mumbling instructions for the guys to come around to the back of the apartment.  This meant that the annoying back up warning beep on the truck beeped all the way back to the main street of our apartment complex and all the way back down the backside of the apartment.  (My roommate, meanwhile, was still in bed and heard the beep and wondered why she couldn't get her alarm clock to shut off).  I'm sure all of the other apartment dwellers on our block were not pleased by the noise, either.    Jene' comes downstairs at this time, mumbling to herself, that she couldn't figure out why she couldn't get her alarm clock to shut off.  I mumble back that I have to move my car (did I mention I'm still in my jammies?)... yes, I had to operate heavy machinery at 8:32 a.m. before my brain was fully operational.  I had to back up my car so we could get the washing machine out of the back gate.  I pulled my car back into its parking space as the Salvation Army guys pull away.  Jene' is standing in the doorway wondering why they came before we called to find out when they would come... or something like that.  Back to bed.  Sigh.  Am all clammy because it's already 80 degrees and humid outside.  My heartbeat slows and I doze off until...  My phone rings at 9:32 a.m.  Everyone I know knows the no phone calls on Saturday before 11 a.m. unless someone is  bleeding, kidnapped or dead (or having a baby).   It's a woman with a thick accent asking for Reverend Pierre and that she got my home number from the number left on the message.  (Reverend Pierre was the former user of my former cell phone number, and he hasn't had that number for over two years because I had it).  I tell her she has the wrong number and hang up, wondering how she got my home #.  Then I slowly remember that as my old cell phone battery was dying in January I changed my message to include my home # so people could get in touch with me until I got a new phone.  I gave that phone back to my employers at the end of January and assumed that the message would cease to exist as soon as the cell phone was deactivated.  Granted, there was some confusion about the cell phone and in March I was contacted and asked about it, but even  then , I assumed when it was finally deactivated that the message would cease to exist.   Au contraire .  I called my old cell # and was able to change my message to, "This was Sharon's phone, but now it's not.  Consider this a wrong number."  So, I e-mailed the proper people at my old job and told them what happened that they might want to check whether it was ever deactivated or not.  After all... why keep paying for it when no one is using it?  Of course, it could be that the phone was deactivated but the message was not, but in either case, I wanted them to check.     UGH.   So, I tried to go back to bed and read, but I couldn't so I went down and ate some Cheerios and tried to wake up.  Then I felt conscious enough to apply some Garnier Nutrisse #101 to my hair and shower before this other guy came to pick up the old dryer.  Such a busy Saturday morning for me - ha ha... busier than usual anyway.  Now I have to help figure out what we are going to do with all the things (including the vacuum cleaner) that we used to store on top of the broken washing machine.  Have a good evening!

       I CAN NOW DO LAUNDRY  IN MY JAMMIES    Jene' purchased a used washer and dryer and we hooked it up tonight.  She got an incredible deal (who's surprised, she's the bargain diva) and both units are in great condition.  In fact, Jene' is doing laundry right now.  The washer is fairly quiet and the only reason I know the washer is on is... the lights are blinking all over the house (it's a strobe-like blinking).  We live in an apartment complex that is over 30 years old, so the wiring leaves a little to be desired, but we're not worried.    Granted, the lights only blink when the washer is agitiating, so the blinking is only for a few minutes at a time.  I haven't had the use of a washer in my home since 1999, and let me just say, I will  never  take doing laundry inside my own home for granted again.  I am so thankful I can now do laundry in my jammies again... that I will learn to ignore the strobe lights or I'll put in some 80's music and start dancing.  Thanks Jene'!  Jene' just yelled upstairs, "I'm very happy.  I just did a load of laundry and I'm not wearing pants!"  Ah, yes, the joys of laundering inside your own home.

       PRESCHOOL PIROUETTES   I just returned from a preschool dance recital.  My roommate is a nanny and I have often visited her at work and played with the children on days when I'm not working (the parents are okay with this by the way).  Sadly, since my niece and nephew are in Indiana, time with these children is some of the most contact I have with ankle-biters and knee-huggers.  So, when the opportunity to actually go to a dance recital came about, I eagerly jumped at the chance.  (and, I just need to get out of the house sometimes you know)  There are three distinct groups of preschool dancers.  A) the  serious, trying to hard to impress mommy and daddy because this is the only attention I will get all week  dancers, B) the  silly "I'm in my own world,"  dancers, and C) the " NO!" I'm not going to do it  dancers.  This group appeared to have 3-5 year olds but since this was not the first recital, so group C was not represented this time around.    I went to see Sara dance.  Sara will be 4 in August, and enthusiastically represented group B.  She truly enjoyed herself.  I was amazed that kids that young could pay attention for an hour's worth of dancing, so I was not surprised that Sara would occasionally get wrapped up in spinning or twirling and her mind would wander off.  Then suddenly, she'd snap to and giggle and get back in line and start watching the teacher again.  The teacher gets an award for patience, because at any given time, only two of the fifteen girls were doing anything at the same time.  Sara had a great time and she was a joy to watch.  Group A was difficult to watch.  There were at least three girls who were so serious about doing everything perfectly that they didn't smile the entire time.  This made me sad.  It's sad to think that something so fun can be serious (for whatever reason) for a child so young.  Group B and Group C parents are easy to spot in the crowd.  They are either laughing at their twirlers or somewhere between amused and embarrassed at the constant, "NO!" and lack of dancing.   Group A parents are tough to spot.  The Group A girls are so serious about getting everything right so their parents (if they were there) would be proud of them... that they really didn't take their eyes off the teacher to make eye contact with their parents.    Ah, the parents.  Most of the parents there had just come from work (you know, high end jobs) and most of the moms in attendance appeared to be working moms.  Parents and a few grandparents lined the back of the room with sophisticated cameras and video equipment.  What struck me was how many parents kept looking at their watches and how many of them were late.  Most of the late parents came in the door with bouquets of roses for their little ballerinas.  I wonder if they were late because of the flowers and I wonder if they would have bought the flowers if they knew how excited their kids would be just because they  showed up .  Now not all parents are that way -- Sara's parents have been careful not to spoil her (too much-ha).  She, unlike many of the others, did not get a new outfit to dance in  each week .  Sara danced in the same leotard all semester.  Sara did not get a dozen roses after the recital, but a single rose (from her nanny) and a tiny bouquet of purple flowers (from her mommy) that one of her baby sisters quickly dismantled.  I was  flabbergasted  at all the flowers to tell the truth.  I was in high school before I got a single rose from anybody... well, that's not counting all the dandelions my little brother used to bring me from the yard.  I started thinking, "What will these girls have to look forward to?"  and also wondered what they would think when a boy approached them when they were 16 with a single daisy.  Will they be disappointed?  After all, at 3 years old, they got  a dozen roses .    I've seen some of these kids birthday parties, too.   After attending one three year old's birthday party a few years ago (that included a 7' Pooh that scared all the kids, a moon walk on their front lawn (and the permits from the city to shut the street down so there would be ample parking) and party favors for each attendee that cost at  least  $10 each - for over 20 three year old guests) I turned to the father and asked, "So, what are you going to do when he's 16?  Buy him a Lexus and have his favorite rock group over for a party?"  He shrugged his shoulders and pointed to a little boy who was running around punching the other kids.  "His party was last week," he sighed, "and he had a petting zoo in his yard, a clown,  and  a juggler.  I wasn't sure how to top that."  Sad... very, very sad.  These are also the same preschoolers who have TV/VCR combos in their rooms, CD players and enough toys to fill FAO Schwartz.  I got my first tape recorder/radio combo when I was 12 and  I  had to buy it.  I had a TV (black & white and there was no remote) in my room when I was 14, but that was only after my appendix burst and I almost died and I had to stay in bed a lot (and my grandfather bought it).   For my birthday last year, a friend of mine sent me some Gerbrera daisies for my birthday and I was so thrilled.  I was in my mid to late twenties before I had most of the appliances that these kids take for granted and they aren't even 5 yet!  No wonder kids turn to drugs and sex and other horrible things to get that next high.  Their parents set them up for it, yet these parents are the ones who are surprised when little Cindy gets arrested for alcohol possession at 14.  Oh, I could go on and on.  Sometimes I wonder why people have kids if they don't want to raise them... but that's another blog entry.  Toodles, peeps!

       RUBEN IS MY (AMERICAN) IDOL   Let me start this blog by stating that I am  not , I repeat  NOT  into reality television.  I have a friend at work who has seen every reality series that has been on television, including the spectacular  Temptation Island , and I had to write her a very special Top 10 about her reality TV addiction (if I find it, I'll post it).   I confess that in the 90's I got into MTV's  The Real World  (2 - LA, 9ish - New Orleans) because each featured a committed Christian and I was fascinated to see how they would navigate an MTV show and survive the persecution and mocking.  The rest of  The Real World  Series didn't interest me.  I have never watched  Survivor , and  The Bachelor  is single for a reason.  I might actually watch the one about comics because I like to laugh and because it's on network TV the comedy will have to be somewhat clean... but I will probably pass on it.  TV is so saturated with reality shows right now that I couldn't help but laugh when the most recent, the one about models, was announced.  Let's face it... I watch TV to AVOID reality.    I have not watched  American Idol , either.  I know enough about the shows because Houston DJ's can't avoid talking about it the morning after an American Idol show, especially since top ten finalist Kimberly Caldwell was from Katy, a suburb of Houston.  After all the oohing and ahhing over  Ruben Studdard  you'd think I'd tune in, but I resisted.  So, while at home today (you know, I'm semi-unemployed) I heard that Oprah was doing a show behind the scenes of  American Idol .  I thought, "Wow, I can watch one hour and be caught up on the whole thing!"  I saved myself countless hours by doing this, trust me.   HOWEVER , once I heard Ruben  sing , well, let's just say I have kicked myself repeatedly for the last hour.  I probably won't watch  American Idol  tonight (come on, there are two NBA playoff games on tonight) but the minute the man puts out a CD, I will own it.    I do know, however, why I did not allow myself to get caught up in this show... I'd have too many nightmares about the evil things I'd want to do to Simon.

       TIME FOR A RE-WRITE   Okay.  I  get  it now.  It's  sink or swim  time.   Put your money where your mouth is  time.  It's  I've got to do this or I'll explode  time.     SO...   Please pray for me.  I am at a crossroads in my life.  I am still looking for a job, still searching for a way to keep myself from becoming a homeless statistic.  You know how they say most people are two paychecks away from being homeless?  I guess I represent  most people .  I have scrounged my way for three years now and I'm nowhere near any goal I have ever set for myself -- except for the goal of not being homeless.  I'm precariously near blowing that goal and failing at something most people take for granted -- putting a roof over their heads.    Therefore, in addition to trying to find a job, I am going to try something radically different.  I am going to try to do some freelance writing to supplement my income.     "It's about time!"  you shout at your computer monitor.  "Go for it!"  you chant while your neighbors think you're looney.  "What's taken you so long?"  you inquire loudly to no one in particular.  ...and yet some of you will declare:   "Have you lost your mind?!"   Well, listen.  I've listened to the  "Have you lost your mind?!"  crowd for 34 years and y'all are full of (fill in the blank -- use your imagination-- be colorful).  I've listened to y'all and look where it's gotten me.  I'm miserable, out of sync, and barely surviving.  I've tried to fit into the mold that our workaholic culture dictates, and I just can't do it anymore.  If you think I've lost my mind, I have, but in the process, I've retrieved my soul from the abyss of  You Will Never Succeed So Why Even Bother?  or another vestibule of creative hell.    Once that notion crystalized in my worn out brain, my ears perked up and my eyes brightened.  Yes, indeed, I  have  lost my mind!  If the  "Have you lost your mind?!"  crowd has anything to say, I  reject  it, and they can keep it and do whatever makes them happy with it, but for the love of Pete, please don't try to infect anyone else with the negative psychobabble.  Y'all have nearly killed me.   Please  don't do it to anybody else.  If you're unhappy with your life, fine.  Either do something about it or shut up.   For me, to not create is self destructive.   I've had it drilled into my head since I was a kid that creativity was not practical, and that dreams come true for  other  people.  Well, for decades now, I've tried to be practical and I've watched other people's dreams come true.  Practicality, conformity and the death of my dreams has not prospered me whatsoever.  So, I'm taking a U-turn now.  It may not turn out how I picture it... but I'm pretty sure that's a good thing.  It will most likely turn out better.  It may be a long, very long time before I see any results from my labors, but I'm not going to deny myself anymore.  It's  my  time now and I have no problem with saying that any longer.    Anyone who has a problem with it, proceed with caution if you ask for an autographed copy of anything I've written, and don't expect to see your name under  acknowledgments  or  thank you's .   Amen .  And if that seems harsh to y'all, imagine what y'all did to me every time you took my dreams and squashed them in the name of practicality and conformity and all the other garbage y'all fed me.  I think, yes, I  know  I'm being much nicer to you right now than you were to me and my dreams.  Trust me on this.  So... I'm finally going to try to realign myself with who I was so long ago... and go a different direction.  I may not succeed in dollars, but I will succeed in sense.

       80 DEGREES AT 9 PM   It's 80 degrees at 9 p.m.  It's still hot upstairs... the air conditioner has run all day.  Yes, it's the beginning of May and it's already hitting the high 80's and even the 90's during the day.  Somewhere in Central America grass is burning and it's blowing up the coast and making our days hazy, our eyes water, and it's making me sneeze.  ( Achoo!  Bless me or something).  From now until mid October, Southeast Texas is a sauna.  The hazy air is just the icing on the cake.  It's the eve of Mother's Day.  The first Mother's Day without my mom.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel, really.  My main goal is just to get through tomorrow and move on.  I haven't been home on Mother's Day since 1994.  Most of Mother's Day has been cards and phone calls.  It's an odd feeling when you can't call anymore.  As a friendly tip, keep that in mind.  It's time for me to go adjust the a/c again.  I will make it through tomorrow and I will keep my chin up, I promise.

       A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE   (10 things that make me think of a certain Nerkian - you know who you are!)    I apologize if you don't get most of these, but hey, I'm getting back into the swing of doing "lists."  I know of one person who will enjoy this immensely and you (and you know who you are, too) will get your list soon... or you could try and guess who my favorite Nerkian is!   10)   Penny Lane  .  I heard that song this week and started singing, "Anderson is in my ears and in my eyes..." and Jene' turned to me and wondered if I bumped my head too hard or something.  9)   Love Snaps (TM).    Rubber bands - free entertainment.  And that's all I have to say about that...  8)   Noxious fumes and the woman who gave birth to 16 babies at once .   Stay up until 3 a.m. with a good friend and read  The Star  or the  National Enquirer  and fun will commence.  I mean, if you believe those stories, you need more help than I can give you.  7)   Well YOU can be...  .  While driving in the country recently... well, I saw this barn door... and started laughing.    6)   Green Acres  .  Still can't stand that song unless it is sung by a certain group of people.  Whenever that Old Navy commercial came on the air, I cried out in protest!  5)   Bari Sax .   No, not a person.  An instrument of epic proportions.  Anchors a jazz ensemble (in my humble opinion).   HONK!   4)   Bright orange birthday cards  .  Very LARGE,  blinding  orange birthday cards...  3)   HELLO!  My name is Inigo Montoya... you killed my father... prepare to die  .  I mean, I can quote this movie backwards and forwards, but the Nerkian can trump me on this one...and several Mel Brooks movies.  2)   Ohio...   is how you say hello in Japanese.  The other "Ohio" is a state full of nuts... I mean  Buckeyes.   1)   MacGyver  .  The other day, I was jerryrigging something... with duct tape, a paper clip, an eraser and some sticky tak... ah, the memories...  And for honorable mention...  think Popeye...  Okay, that is it for this evening... I will list more later!

       DOORBELL...   FYI... we have a new doorbell, so if you are so inclined, come to Texas and ring it!  We'd love to see you!  No, I'm not on anything.  It's just that I made a major decision tonight and I feel better for just having made the decision, regardless of whether it's a good or bad decision.  It has to do with a leadership position I had at church.  I took a leave of absence in March and today was the day when I was supposed to jump back in... and I've decided not to.  I just have too much on my plate right now.  I also don't have the energy and passion to devote to the task...and if there's anything I've seen too much of in the church, it's burned out leaders doing a particularly poor job because they need to take a break, but they feel compelled to stick it out or that they don't deserve one (or worse yet, they think there won't be anyone good enough to take their place).  It's that whole notion that serving God means suffering, long faces, and weeping and gnashing of teeth and, well, I don't believe that's how it should be (see  May 26, 2003  post).     If more leaders (in any field) would take sabbaticals, time off beyond a "vacation," -- whatever you want to call it -- I think the quality of leadership would greatly improve.  In my case, I took the position in the middle of three of the toughest years of my life and I wasn't properly prepared.  I didn't have the wisdom to say, "Hey, I don't think I'm ready for this."  I can say it now in hindsight and I can say now that's not the role I'm supposed to play right now.    And I'm very confident in this decision.

       FINALLY FINISHED...   After an hour and a half tearing through the last five chapters of  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , I realized Jene' was right when she said I should wait until today to finish the book.  I would never have slept afterward!  Now, I have to wait until the next book... (sigh)  It really is good reading.

       CONGRATULATIONS, RICE OWLS!   Houston's own Rice Owls have won the NCAA Baseball Championship.  This proves that smart, articulate people can also play sports... well .  It was refreshing to be able to understand every syllable these young men uttered during the post-game interviews.  Complete sentences without any, "...uh..." or "...yo..." or shouts out to academically (or criminally) suspended teammates... truly refreshing...  My friend Jarred (Rice graduate) sent me the following.  I can only assume that it's a Rice U. cheer of some sort. (lol)  e to the x, dy/dx; e to the x, dx; secant, tangent, cosine, sine; 3.14159; square root, cube root, btu; compass, slide rule, go Rice U.!  Cheerleading with an incredibly high GPA...

       STOP?  WHAT DOES SHE MEAN...STOP?!   It's  11 p.m.   Jene' asks, "So where are you in the story?"  I tell her I've just started  Chapter 32  (page 729 of 870) and she advises me to stop.  Her reasoning is that well, I'm entering the "quick-paced" thrill-packed ending and if I continue reading even a few more pages, I'll be sucked in and won't get to sleep until after 1 a.m. and then I won't be  really  able to sleep after that, because I'll be all worked up at the end... so...  I will finish  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  tomorrow evening.  (SIGH)

       HARRY IS  MINE ...   (No Spoilers...other than those already mentioned in the newspaper)  Jene' finished  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  at  5:30 a.m. Sunday morning .  I told you she wouldn't sleep until she was finished.  After she woke up, she handed Harry over to me and I started reading...some time around 1:00 p.m.  At midnight I made myself stop, and I only got to  page 459 .    Today, I arrived at the Post Office (Rich Hill Station) at 4:55 p.m. to rescue my copy of Harry Potter. There were about twenty people in line ahead of me.  I knew this would take a while.  I have a great respect for the Postal System, but this particular post office is full of grumpy women (The Grump Sisters) who obviously do not enjoy their jobs (except for the little woman on the end who always seems to have a smile on her face and a kind word to say) and they make sure none of the customers enjoy their visit to the post office.  I never go to this post office because of these people and because the stamp machines take your money and you can never get a refund to save your life.  I will go  out of my way  to go to another post office.    Side note:  I always feel a little sorry for the Grump Sisters until they are rude to me.  I feel sorry for anyone that hates their jobs that much that it makes them miserable, and I know they probably couldn't get hired anywhere else with their attitudes, but for goodness' sake, find something you like to do that will make you happy!  (but I digress...)  After twenty minutes in line, it was my turn.  I kept thinking, "God, please let me get the little woman on the end," but I got the Big Sister Grump.  Since it was already 5:15 and there were still about eight people behind me, she practically ripped the package ticket out of my hand.  She rolled her eyes when she saw it was from Amazon.com.  She came back and handed me my package and I was FREE!  I left, went back out into the 100 degree heat (110 heat index) and drove home through idiot hour (I mean rush hour).  Though I live a mile from the post office, this was nearly deadly, as someone in the turn lane decided he needed to be in my lane instead (no signal, either).    And now (deep breath) I have some reading to do...

       HYSTERICAL OVER HARRY    Happy Birthday, Jene'!     Jene' paced (giddily skipped... is more like it) to the front door five times this morning to check if her copy of  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  had been delivered.  At  1:24 p.m.  (CDT), however, she was still waiting.  I was sitting at my computer when I heard her shout from her room.   She shouted much like a six year old who runs to the Christmas tree and sees his first bike wrapped with a ribbon exuberantly shouts. "I hear a truck!  I hear a truck!" she squealed.  She ran downstairs and threw open the door and met Mr. FedEx with open arms.  Mr. FedEx explained that he had delivered 200 copies already and had about 20 left on his schedule for the day.  Jene' thanked him and skipped back into the house.  She giggled excitedly and ripped open the package and held the book up in triumph.  Harry Potter is in the house.   My  copy of the fifth installment of J. K. Rowling's boy wizard series supposedly arrived at  1:39 p.m.,  according to my tracking number (I chose USPS because I pre-ordered the book several weeks ago to save money).  We had just left for Jene's birthday lunch at the  Panda Garden .  The orange notice left with the rest of the mail stated that my copy of  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  is now being held hostage at the post office until 6:00 a.m. Monday.  This means that I will not be able to get the book until after work (if I hurry and get there before 5) or until Tuesday, when I'm not working.  UGH.  Jene' started reading about an hour ago and is on page 119 out of approx. 870.  If I know Jene', she will sleep very little tonight and probably finish the book before church tomorrow.  This could be a bonus, because I could read a little tomorrow afternoon...   Ah, the joys of reading!

       BEACH BLANKET BINGO AND OTHER EVENTS   Jene' and I just returned from an overnight adventure (courtesy of Jene's employers) in Galveston.  We left last night after I got off work and we fought traffic for an hour and a half and we finally arrived at  Moody Gardens .  (Go to www.moodygardens.org)  We had a lovely dinner, highlighted by the squeals and activities of Jene's employers' children... three girls, one who will turn  4  in August, and twins who will turn  2  three days after their sister.  Follow that?    We woke up this morning to sunny skies.  Jene' mercifully brought up a bagel and cream cheese for me while I fumbled around to get ready.  I know... how difficult can it be to get into a one piece bathing suit?  Well, I made it into the suit and we joined the family at "Palm Beach" a pool area with sand brought in from Florida (if you've been to Galveston, you know how ugly and dirty the sand seems/is).  Three pools (one that's four feet deep and has a "mushroom" shower in the middle, one with a waterfall and one with an octopus slide) are surrounded by blue umbrellas and two beach chairs each.  We arrived on the scene at 11 a.m.    We had been there about fifteen minutes when it rained softly for about five.  Then the sun came back out.  After an hour of visiting each pool, including the "mushroom" and no, I did not go down the octopus slide, sand castle construction began.  One of the twins decided it would be fun to eat sand, while the other tried to decide if she wanted to get "dirty" with the sand or not.  The almost four year old lived in the water for the most part (Her swimming lessons have equipped her quite well), except when she'd try to build a sandcastle and the sand-eating twin would stomp on it.   A few minutes later,  it was decided it was time for lunch, and we headed for the beach showers.    We were all dressed (except for mother and almost four year old) when it began to rain.  At first, it was a soft rain like before.  Then, the mother and almost four year old come out of the dressing area and the monsoon is unleashed.  We are on a covered patio area and are not getting wet.  After ten minutes when it really starts to come down, we are joined by the other beach faithful.  We all study the sky, wondering when it will let up and how long do we wait?  The twins, at this point, have inhaled two small containers of Honey Nut Cheerios and assorted Teddy Grahams and are both signing and gently screaming for more.  Finally, I get in front of the double stroller with the tarp and Jene' and the mother hold the other end of the tarp over dad (the double stroller driver) and the stroller while the almost four year old hangs on to the stroller handle.  We wait until it lets up a bit and make a break for the restaurant door.  We make it, and we're still dry.  :)  After lunch, with food everywhere (three tired children... it gets wild, but fun), we leave and eventually decide to call it a day.  We leave for Houston and her employers are behind us somewhere and we fight lovely Houston traffic to get home.  It starts raining again as we about six miles from our house, and continues for an hour or so.  For some reason... I am tired and randomly blogging... so I will go...  P. S. I am happy to report that I did not get a sunburn.  SPF 45 rocks!

       CONGRATULATIONS, SAN ANTONIO!!   A Texas team won the NBA championship!  Other than the Pacers winning, this is the second best thing.  :)    Houston will host the 2004 Super Bowl.  Jene' says I'm delusional because I think the Colts will actually get it together this year.  Hey, I'm loyal.  I was loyal to the Colts during the late 80's and 90's  and  through the Eric Dickerson disappointment.  I remember all the years of Monday morning's anthem, "God help our Colts."  I think if they actually get the defense in gear, they could have a shot.  Of course, I'm also loyal to the Houston Texans  unless  they are playing the Indianapolis Colts.  Congratulations,  David Robinson , one of the NBA's few class acts.  He will be missed.  I totally loved him praising God for the victory!  I'm going to Galveston tomorrow night for a short break, so I have to get a few things together tonight.  I promise, longer, thoughtful blogs will be forthcoming in the weeks to come.  :)  Good night!

       MONSOONS AND HOOPS   I am so glad that my next door neighbor can't hear me scream when I'm watching basketball games.  My roommate, on the other hand, is worse than I am, but more often than not, she chooses not to watch the game for fear she might permanently damage her vocal cords or a vessel in her brain might explode.  She can usually tell the status of the game by what or how loudly I am shouting.  The game is over... I will probably calm down enough to go to sleep in a couple of hours.  Now, onto rain... we finally got some more in the form of the usual Houston monsoon.  Though we get several inches per hour, it usually rains less than one hour and for that we are grateful, lest we get 38 inches in less than 24 hours and relive Tropical Storm Allison all over again...but I digress.  At least I lived on the third floor and my car was parked on the second floor of the parking garage...   At least the satellite didn't go out during the game.  Priorities...

       I TRIED ALL THOSE BATHING SUITS ON FOR NOTHING...   Well, folks, my vacation for next week has been canceled.   It was to be a "working vacation" and Jene' and I would have been taking care of three little girls in the mornings, taking them to the beach and playing, then we would have our evenings free, etc.  They were going to pay for transportation and the hotel, which would have made it a vacation for me in a sense.  I would have been out of town and in essence, relaxing.  It was to be my first vacation (or the closest I could get) in over seven years.  Yes, I am disappointed, but I know it's a blessing in disguise.  I am still not employed full time and even though I was going to lose only two days of work, I have already expended a ton of energy trying to figure out how I was going to pay rent for July.  I am still trying to figure that out, but the deficit will be a lot less now.    Back to the drawing board!  Jene' has to go back to Wal-Mart to return some beach stuff tonight.  The only beach stuff I got was a hat and swim shoes, and I could always use those, so I think I'll keep them.  Call it optimism... :)

       WHAT'S IN A NAME?   Okay, I'm curious... have any of you named a car?  I've had three cars in 18 years.  I named my first car, a 1979 tan chevette,   Clovis  (it was a chocolate milk commerical that included a chocolate cow named Clovis...I was 16...what can I say?).  My second car... was a 1988 red Chevy Cavalier that I named  Cephas .  Cephas is Greek for Peter/which means Rock.  I was in my  I just graduated from a Christian college and I know a bunch of cool Greek biblical words and I'm so cool  phase.  I also chose it because my German name in German class was Petra (Petra means Rock, literally and it's also a Petra  album ... and if you don't know who I'm talking about you are either too young to read this blog or you have never listened to Christian music.  Either way, welcome).  My third car, my current, formerly berry, now  dusky fawn  car, is named  Ruthie  from a Tony Evans sermon that talked about, "God knows where Boaz lives.."  (If Boaz is new to you, read the book of Ruth in the Bible.  It is a story of God's faithfulness in desperate times).    So, I have Clovis, Cephas, and Ruthie.  Anybody else ever name their car?  If so, what did you name yours?

       BLAME IT ON THE RAIN... OR LACK THEREOF...   Tonight, it  finally  rained on the southeast coast of Texas... everywhere but Houston.  It rained (monsooned) in the counties north, east and west of Houston, but not  in  Houston. My car used to be a nice berry color, but now my car classifies as  dusky fawn  or  dusty beige metallic .  I'm in the "Why bother to wash it?" phase.  After all, I do work next to the freeway, so every day, my car gets a fresh coat of dusky fawn and dusty beige metallic residue, in addition to the lovely pollen, ash, and other pollutants that the Houston smog has to offer.  Granted, when Houston does receive it's weekly 4 to 5 dibble dops of rain, or I accidentally park my car next to a hidden sprinkler, the drops make the dusky fawn look like it's been shot in about four places, but better that than washing the car only to have the satisfaction of seeing it dustless/clean for approximately 5 hours.    The salvage guy came and towed away Jene's car, Sheila (you'll have to ask her), on Friday.  Sheila was declared officially "totaled," and Jene' will receive compensation for Sheila tomorrow, which she will deposit into a car fund (after she buys a bus pass).  Fortunately, Houston has an adequate public tansportation system and she works about a mile from home.  Church is a quick bus ride down Westheimer.  Wal-Mart, more than one grocery store, and Sam's are all within a reasonable walking distance for Jene'.  I also still have transportation (that without a/c resembles more of a sauna with wheels and a radio of which the volume cannot be adjusted...).  Jene' is not one to whine or mope, so she waved goodbye to Sheila and now my dusky fawn car takes up our two spaces so Sheila's spot doesn't look so empty.  I will fast forward in this story (after Sheila's departure) or rewind (it's all about perspective, isn't it?) to Saturday night in San Angelo, where Jene's nephew, Josh, graduated from high school.  I had wondered how the entire family was going to be able to attend, let alone sit together, but I was assured that since the ceremony was outdoors that would be possible.  OUTDOORS?!  Affirmative.  Outdoors... at 8 p.m. in West Texas, where, though it was still in the 80's, the humidity is low enough that the air wasn't that bothersome.  Over 700 calm and surprisingly well-behaved seniors sat on the far side of the field... a sea of blue that grew exponentially larger as the time approached 8 p.m.    My own graduation (in 1987) featured over 460 people in rented dorky silver and maroon gowns and it took almost four hours.  Girls wore the caps on the back of their heads, perpendicular to the floor, to make room for their big tidal wave bangs.  JoEllen sang as the graduation band played Night Ranger's  Goodbye .   Several other songs were sung and more than one speech was made.  Graduates received a Bible of their choice and when the prayer was uttered, it was definitely to the one true God and nobody had a problem with that.  At one point early on in the ceremony, a prayer was uttered that began with a vague "Holy One," and continued with a list of vague spiritual references and a general sense of, well,  vagueness  that led me and several people in my general vacinity to whisper, "Does anybody know who she's praying to?"  I shook my head.  The trouble with vagueness in this case is that though the prayer is uttered upward with good, inclusive and tolerant intentions, the prayer falls quickly to the ground, and the thud that follows sounds like the door to heaven slamming shut in disgust.  I think God was pretty clear when He told Moses to pass it on to the rest of us, "You shall have no other gods before me."   I'm not going to preach on this, but this instance was a reality check.  I now live in a world where God isn't at the top of the list anymore... though He's still on the list, He's getting shuffled down the list in the name of tolerance, inclusiveness, and good intentions.  I suppose this move allows the Christians then to also pray, but one wonders which is better -- an all-inclusive, vague prayer, or none at all?  Of course, if a Christian complains, she's hateful and intolerant and her house gets egged.  If a Buddist complains, his brother gets to lead his own prayer/meditation the next year when he graduates.  Ok...I'm going to get off my soapbox now.  Just chew on it.  As I was saying, we were sitting in the bleachers high above the football field on a warm, dry night.  I was sitting in between Jean (Jene's mother) and Julia (Jene's sister, who is my age).  Julia's husband, Jeff, recently returned from duty in the Persian Gulf, sat on the end of the row with Grant, their 3 month old son.  I could list all the other members of the McClellan/Speciale clan that had gathered to watch Josh graduate, but I need to keep this a small blog if I can (ha ha).  Just trust me, Josh was well represented in the stands.    At my graduation, families were asked not to scream, applaud or anything else until everyone's name had been called.  My graduation was in a gymnasium and the screaming would have meant extra pauses between 460 plus names and graduation would have taken 5 hours... in an open football stadium... well, those noisy airhorns and cowbells were ringing and blasting all over the place, including in poor little Grant's ears (while I was holding him).  He did not take too kindly to the blasts.  I did not take kindly to the blasts on his behalf, but as we've established in previous blogs, I'm learning that it's not about me, so I passed Grant down to Jene' who was further down from the inconsiderate blast-er and I let the blast-er live until his graduation.    This graduation lasted under two hours.  I was amazed.  Several faculty members teamed up to recite over 700 names.  Some kids danced as they crossed the stage, one kid did a flip, and two sign language interpreters signed each and every one of those names... and it was over in under two hours.  We even got out of the parking lot with relative ease and were home in minutes.  I had to keep reminding myself I wasn't in Houston and we didn't have to wait fifteen minutes to get to the street and then another half hour to clear traffic and then home -- all to go five miles.  No, we were far away from Houston and I rather enjoyed the pace, thank you very much.  The next day, Jene' and I got back into the Toyota Camry to drive home, and we arrived after 10 p.m.  Somewhere in the weekend, Jene' found a Big Lots and more dishes, all the while escorted by her PARKING ANGELS.  Apparently, when Sheila left, the parking angels did not.  I still don't have parking angels unless Jene' is in the car...  ...but I digress... and now it's time for some sleep...

       I DIDN'T WIN, BUT AT LEAST I BOUGHT A TICKET   "God, I've prayed and prayed to win the lottery.  Why haven't I won?"  "Because, my dear sweet  idiot  child, you didn't buy the ticket."  Last weekend, Jene' and I walked down to the convenience store and bought lottery tickets.  Please don't get all righteous on me, this is was my first time, I did it for fun and it only cost me a dollar.  Besides, with my addictive personality, I can only gamble when I have accountabilty.  Jene' was with me and Jene' will be with me if I ever decide to do it again.  (That kooky Jene'... what a stumbling block!  -- Just kidding!)  Heck, I matched ONE number, so that was thrilling.  Tells you the state of my life when I can get a kick out of matching one number that yields nothing in return.  :p    Even buying just one ticket I can see how people can end up spending WAY too much money on this.  The rush of paying a small amount to gain a big amount must be a big draw, otherwise last weekend's lottery wouldn't have been worth over $40 million.  Jene' usually spends about $10 a year and makes about $12, so she comes out ahead and she has fun.  I know people, though, who "invest" hundreds of dollars at the odds of a million to one that they'll win a big payout.  I call this an unwise investment.  Chances are, the lottery is not your answer.   I do, however, hear many people say "when I win the lottery," oh, how their problems will disappear.  No more debt, no more worries about how they will pay for Junior's college, no more worries about what will happen when their husband dies... And yet, one in a million wins... (and he only wins if he buys the ticket first).  I'm thinking this logic is flawed.  I've been gainfully unemployed for over three years, and during that time, I didn't buy a lottery ticket until Saturday.  My addictive tendencies aside, the reason I haven't played the lotto is because I know that such a financial windfall is not likely to happen to me, and I can't wait for lighting to strike before I release myself from debt or plan for the future.  Granted, I'm still in debt, and I have no savings... but it's been a tough 3 1/2 years struggling to make ends meet.  Despite the most erratic of schedules and earnings, each month, the money has been there for my most basic bills.     Would it be  nice  to win the lottery?  I won't lie -- YES IT WOULD BE NICE.  I've often thought of what I would do with a cash payout of $20 mil or so.  Do I wait around to do all those things  until  I win the lottery?  No.  That would be such a waste of time.  Do I think it's wrong to play the lotto?  Only if the money spent on chances could have fed your starving child or paid your light bill.  If it's "extra money" and not excessive, then why not?  I just can't be one of those people who waits around for something to happen to solve all their problems rather than being the solution to their own problem.   I can still say that and laugh as I live in the stressed out arena of looking for a full time job.  Day after day, my life has worked out without matching six numbers and a power ball.

       STRESS AND THE BODY:  THOUGHTS FROM A LIVING TEST SUBJECT   Stress does interesting things to the body.  For the last year, I have experienced everything from tension headaches, backaches, hair loss, upset stomach, insomnia, weight gain, weight loss, weight gain, illness after illness and sometimes, a tightness in my chest.  I've been sick so much from my stressed out immune system, well, the days that I actually  do  have energy and feel good I cherish, because I know it will be days or weeks before I can celebrate that feeling again.  This week, I even sought out one of those blood pressure machines at the drug store to make sure the blood I could hear rushing though my veins wasn't too high.  Turns out, my blood pressure is extremely  normal .  Textbook normal.  Under the circumstances, I think this is a miracle.  I took a stress test on the internet (http://www.teachhealth.com/#stressscale), however, and scored over 300.  Which means:   300 and over:  High susceptibility to stress-related illness .   No duh.  Well, with that news in mind, I am going to take a walk now... I am told that helps to reduce stress...     urlLink

       DSL FAILURE...   I had this wonderful blog written on July 22nd, commemorating the 9th anniversary of my sobriety.  It was deep and meaningful, and when I pushed "send" our DSL cut out and sent my wonderful ramblings into cyberspace.  So, rather than try to reconstruct perfection (ha ha), I've decided to move on.  Maybe on my 10th anniversary next year, I'll treat myself to something extra special... any suggestions?

       SOMEDAY, I'LL LIVE IN A HOUSE   Today is one of those days I covet.  I covet my neighbor's house...  literally .    I live in a fairly quiet neighborhood in an older townhome.  My neighbors are career people and mostly quiet.  If a newbie moves in and disturbs the peace (say, drives in every weekend at 4 a.m. with his stereo on full blast and wakes us  all  up, or has a party with sustained, extrememly loud noise for over an hour), I know one to five of these neighbors will introduce themselves to the newbie and explain the rules.   DO NOT DISTURB .  If someone is too noisy in this complex, they don't last for too long.  Occasionally, however, someone moves in and decides the rules do not apply to  him .    Let me clarify.  It's one thing to be able to hear someone else's music... faintly in the distance.  It's not so disturbing.  It's an entirely different issue when I am inside my apartment and I can not only hear the WORDS of the song clearly, but FEEL the music as well.  I do not appreciate the latter.  It started at 10:30 a.m. when my windows began to vibrate.  I turned on my TV, but had trouble hearing over the thumping music.  By noon, I was more than slightly aggrivated as I was trying to eat my cereal with "Let's Talk About Sex, Baby" assaulting my ears.  I'd had enough.  I walked out the front door and, usually, the perpetrator is someone who is vacuuming/washing their car with the doors wide open (who obviously don't understand about accoustics or manners).  This time, the parking lot was clear.  The music was so loud, however, that it made my head throb.  I looked down toward the pool area and could see a group down there, so I called the office.  I asked her, very sweetly, when their pool party would be over and she asked, "What pool party?"  I explained about the annoyance, and she said I was not the first person to complain and she'd paged the "courtesy officer," to come take care of it.  (apparently, she must have been the phone service that the complex uses when they are out on property or something, read on).    That was at 12:15 p.m.  It is now 1:40 p.m. and the noise hasn't stopped.  I'm about to call again.  (My guess it's an apartment near the pool and someone set their stereo speakers in the window to enjoy music poolside.  I've seen it at other complexes).  When you live in a house, you can play your stereo however loudly you like, and nobody cares.  Your neighbor can do the same, and for the most part, unless there's an open window, you can't hear his music either.  Everybody wins.  This is one of many reasons I would love to live in a house.  In an apartment complex, however, people feel  entitled  to act as if they live in a house.  They give no mind to who's sleep/reading/work, they are disturbing, they feel entitled to enjoy  their  music with the bass boost up to full volume -- whenever they feel like it.   EXAMPLES:   I once lived in an apartment complex that housed young singles, newlyweds and college students.   One floor down and two apartments over... a guy had one of those alarms that get louder if they aren't shut off and they run for a full two hours.  The alarm would go off on the weekends (he didn't sleep at home on the weekends) at 5:45 a.m. and blast for  two  hours, disturbing up to twenty people in the surrounding apartments.  After coming home Mondays to a door full of nasty notes, he made an effort to turn off his alarm when he went out Friday nights.  Another time, same complex, the guy next door had a hot date over and turned his stereo on so loud (so they could hear it in the shower, he said), the bass vibrations knocked a picture off my wall (that barely missed my head when it fell).  I went over and pounded on the door (with the broken picture in my hand) and finally, he came to the door and I held up the picture and told him to turn it down.  His brow creased, as if to say, "Wow, I didn't think it was that loud."  The four people who had lined up behind me to complain (including the girl from  across  the hall) seemed to reinforce my point.  Yeah, right.  And yet another time, in the same complex, the guys downstairs had guitars... with amps.  On the night I was trying to make flight plans at 1 a.m. to get home to see my dying brother, I couldn't even have a conversation on the phone until after I called the "courtesy officer" to come make them shut up.  Forget about trying to sleep in my apartment on weekends.   Apartment dwellers pay attention  -- until you live in your  own  house, with your own four walls that are separate and detached from your neighbor's walls... and you no longer share a floor/ceiling with someone -- you are  not  entitled to share your love of Eminem with all those who live around you, and especially not at 4 a.m.  I'm sorry, you have your rights, blah, blah, blah, but not in an apartment complex.  In apartment living, you must learn to be CONSIDERATE and to SHARE space with up to a thousand other people.  Don't be arrogant enough to think that the lady next door with the infant son, or the elderly couple across the hall love to  feel  your music.  They don't.  If want to have your "musical freedom" that badly... save your money and buy a house.  In the meantime, play nice with others,  please .  Okay... that's my rant.  Someday, I will live in a house, but until then...   And, it's 2:45 and I just called the office again, but this time, the apartment worker on the phone said, "yes!  We are having a pool party in appreciation of our residents!"  I told her I appreciated that, but asked when it would end.  She seemed confused, but said 4 p.m.  We'll have peace and quiet at 4 p.m.  This resident didn't appreciate their pool party, and the other people walking around in the parking lot trying to see where the noise was coming from didn't either.  I'm hoping this will be the last DJ'd pool party.

       CLAUDETTE NO MORE   Claudette's eye was headed straight toward the Galveston area until about 10 p.m. last night, when the high pressure system north of us (that was supposed to show up a day or two ago) finally showed up and shoved her straight west to Port O'Connor and the Matagorda Bay.  Claudette became a hurricane shortly after midnight, packing winds of up to 85 mph (near the eye) by the time she made landfall.  Rain and wind from Claudette rolled into town in the wee hours this morning -- while I was still in bed.  The electricity blinked off a time or two, but then everything was fine.  Of course, people all over town lost power, including SBC -- our DSL provider.  Therefore, it is after 8 p.m. in the evening, and I am just now online for the first time today.  Fortunately, I could watch the hurricane coverage on our local channel, and one of  the  most notable hurricane specialists in the world, Dr. Neil Frank, is a meteorologist for CBS here in Houston.  MUCH better coverage than the Weather Channel, who merely yawned and updated the hurricane coverage for about 15 minutes per hour.    There are a few branches down here and there, and, as I said, some were without power for a good portion of the day, but for the most part, Houston is far enough inland that the hurricane was a non issue by the time I woke up at 7:30.  I never did lose satellite coverage (our dish is on a pole in a bucket of concrete because our apartment complex won't let us attach it to anything) and though it rained all day, most of Houston's streets drained well.  So, Claudette wasn't nearly as bad as her witch sister Allison.  We are breathing a sigh of relief here.  In Galveston and Kemah, the storm surge washed away a good portion of all the beaches.  In Texas, the state of Texas owns all property between the vegetation line and the water, so many homes have now found themselves on the other side of the line.  That should play out nicely.  In Port O'Connor and Palacios, the damage was pretty extensive (the dorms of the camp where the middle schoolers go no longer exists), but I don't think anybody was killed.  Of course, the networks had lots of coverage of the IDIOTS who stayed to "wait it out," and the IDIOT TOURISTS who purposely took their kids down to the seawall to get their pictures taken with the stormy seas behind them.  They don't get my vote for parents of the year.  All in all, though, Claudette is finished here.  She is the first hurricane to hit the Texas coast in 13 years, so we're hoping we're safe for at least a decade...

       HERE COMES CLAUDETTE    You know, I have a great respect for technology and science, but I have to laugh at the predictions that Tropical Storm Claudette would "absolutely make an abrupt turn westward," and make landfall on the border between Texas and Mexico.  "Don't worry, Houston," they said.  "You won't even know Claudette was here," they assured.  Well, I'll give them a little credit, Claudette  did  turn west as predicted...  then she thumbed her nose at the entire world of meteorology and said, "I'll show you and your (bleepin') computers!"  Claudette then turned back east... then west, as if to tease... then north... then northwest... then she stalled, gained momentum, looked about 200 miles north of South Padre' Island, and said, "Ooh, let's go play there!"  The eye is now predicted to make landfall in Matagorda Bay, about 82 miles southwest of Houston (if that's what Claudette decides to do.  After all, she could just be playing with us).    Claudette's eye will most likely not pass over Houston, nor will we get much wind and damage from this storm.  Houston is on the east side of this tropical storm (that wants to be a small Category 1 hurricane so bad it can taste it) -- the side of the storm that nets all the RAIN.  The hurricane expert was just asked, "People in Houston are nervous... should they be?"  He skirted around the issue and wouldn't commit, only saying that it will be windy and rainy right now.   Ah,  you might sigh,  that can't be all that bad, can't it?   Um... yes it can... and hurricane expert knows this, which is why he won't commit on how bad it will be  because...    Let me introduce you to  Tropical Storm Allison  (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001allison.html#FIG5) who wreaked havoc in Houston for about ten days in early June, 2001.  Allison was a supposedly a relatively harmless tropical storm, and it was supposed to sweep through, bring a little rain, knock down a tree or two, and be gone.  If only Allison had been that kind.    Allison attacked on a Tuesday, flooded a good portion of southern Houston (including my friend Ginger's parent's house), left and came back that Friday... (flooding Ginger's parent's house again) dumping up to 38 inches of rain in East Houston and 20 inches downtown for the week... but a big bucket of that rain came in less than 24 hours.   I was in my apartment (on the third floor) that Friday night, watching the radar and wondering how bad things would get.  I have never heard it rain so hard.  (Ginger, who was on her way back from helping her parents carry all their valuables to the second floor of their house, was caught on the freeway in traffic, which had no place to go because all the access roads and low parts of the freeway were under water.  She and her dog, Chloe, spent the night in the car).    Anyway, It was about 10 p.m. when it started raining so hard I couldn't hear my TV at full volume over the torrential downpour, so I went to bed.  At 3:45 a.m., I awoke to people running down the hallways, cussing, screaming, and more than a dozen car alarms.  I sleepily pulled on a flannel shirt over my pj's and stumbled out into the hallway.  My neighbor, was on the phone with her son, crying.  I walked to the end of the hall and looked down.  Every car on the first floor of the parking garage was under water, which was why the car alarms were going off.  It was odd, hearing all those alarms and seeing the headlights blinking under the muddy water.  My car, thankfully, was on the second floor, nice and dry.  I felt sorry for the lady in the next building who had just bought her PT Cruiser.   I met several of my neighbors that night,  most lamenting parking on the first floor.    The oddest thing about Allison was that several people I knew who lived on the West side of town... got about 1-5" of rain and they had no flooding at all.  The closer into town you got, the higher the rain total.  People lost everything they owned, and it took months to clean up.  Mosquitoes, a usual problem in Houston, were so thick after this that you couldn't be outside very long, even with repellent sprayed everywhere.  I was proud of how the city banded together to help each other, too.  All in all, it was a horrorific experience, though.  Not something I want to go through again.  Now back to Claudette.  Today at work, several people were talking nervously, wondering if we are going to get flooded again.  Granted, in 2001, it was one of the wettest springs ever, and the water had nowhere to go, and this year, though it's rained nearly every day for 40 days, we are still in a deficit and it would take quite a bit of rain to flood like Allison again.    And... the reason I laugh at the technology is... this is nature for goodness sake!  A  storm...  an entity with a mind of its own that has just made a joke of the hurricane experts...again.  Granted, in the past five years, the hurricane gurus have been fairly accurate about strike possibilities, etc., but this time, Claudette giggled, did her own thing, and is about to flex her muscles on the western Gulf coast.    I'll keep you posted!  Don't worry, if you live on the Gulf Coast, you  always  have water and food stored for such a time as this... if indeed it becomes such a time as this...

       BEING A CELEBRITY    Let me insert this disclaimer here...   I am not telling anyone how to live their lives or condemning them if they don't share my beliefs.  I am merely stating my opinion.  I've learned that the world does not have to agree with me... and agreeing to disagree helps me sleep at night.  I don't have to be right all the time and sometimes, I'm not even sure I am anyway.  In fact, think of this as my point of view from this side of the fence.   Yesterday, the world was shaken to the core by the confession of Britney Spears -- "Well, even though I said I was going to wait until I got married, well, no, I'm really not a virgin anymore."  You can read about it here:  ( http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1473676/20030708/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true  or at any other major news wire service).  I tell you, I did not see this coming!  (insert sarcastic laugh here).  After all, Britney coyly made the declaration several years ago that though she dressed like she wanted some action, she was going to remain a virgin until she said, "I do," and people all over the country applauded her stance.  I didn't hold my breath.  The abstinence stance of a few pop stars in the late nineties was the "in" thing because this country, in a desperate attempt to get teens to consider the consequences of unsafe sex, gave these pop icons a lot of  press  for these statements.  Britney wanted to advertise her goods but she didn't want people to talk about her as if she were a slut, so this declaration, obviously, kept Britney walking the tightrope as she maneuvered through pop stardom with a high profile boyfriend.  Before we stone her, I do have to say this.  Though she put herself up on that pedestal, very few people can accomplish what she said she was trying to do:  wait.    I do know, though, that it's not impossible to wait.   I'm a 34 year-old virgin.  I have friends who are virgins and friends who aren't.  I don't look at them and judge them or refer to them as, "this is *name* my non-virgin friend."  It just doesn't work that way.  There's enough room in my heart for people who are different than I am, for people who look at life differently than I do.   If I didn't, my life would feel pretty shallow.  But I digress...  My roommate gives sex talks to sixth graders and introduces herself as "Texas' Oldest Living Virgin."  Kids are just astounded that a woman can be 42 years old, not have sex and be totally and completely normal (Jene' would laugh at the "normal" part).  Because of all of the commercials, TV programs and movies that bombard them with the notion that sex is cool, kids think virgins are weird and must never think about sex in order to remain that way.  Let me be the first to tell you, this is not true.  Virgins date.  Virgins kiss.  Virgins think about sex.  Virgins are sexy.  They just choose to wait to have sex until marriage.    Some people wait because of a commitment to God.  Some wait because they are afraid of disease.  Some wait because they  know  that if anybody on the planet can get pregnant the first time they have sex... it would be them and they know they aren't ready to be parents just yet.  (Jene' volunteers as a birthing coach for pregnant teens and you would be amazed at how many 14-16 year olds said it was their first time or said, sadly, "but he said he loved me").   Some were violated as children and have huge issues with the opposite sex and they need to get that figured out first.  Some wait because they have older, wiser men and women preach at them and others like some friends of mine who absolutely regret not waiting and beg them to not follow in their footsteps. Regardless of the underlying belief to commit to this challenge, many people wait and wait successfully (they just don't get their names put in the paper).    All that to say, I think some say they would wait because it's been the cool thing to say the past decade.  They align themselves with the abstinence movement and the headlines follow.  The fifteen minutes of fame turns into twenty.  To stretch that to twenty five minutes... they come out and say, well, nobody on earth could really do that anyway... and so on.  When I worked in PR the saying was, "Any press is good press."  I beg to differ (and I'm sure Kobe would too).  Being a celebrity is about keeping your name out there, visible, on the tip of every tongue that waggles.  Since Britney is not even on the back burner any more, I don't doubt that her most recent declaration is an attempt to rekindle whatever is left of her career.   How sad to be at the end of your career at 21, struggling, clawing, doing anything to hang on to what you  had  instead of saying, "Okay, that was great, now let's do something new," and reinventing yourself.   She's lived a quarter of her life and made more money than I will in a lifetime and she doesn't know what to do with herself now.    Unless Britney gets a grip, she will follow a long line of former stars that will use anything to keep their names in the spotlight.  The following are a few tried and true tactics that will add a few minutes to her window of fame.  (Note: some people actually go through the following legitimately with no intention to capitalize on it, but I'm not talking about  those  people).         a)  "I've found God/become a Christian."   The Christian subculture will pick this up, tattoo that label on the star's forehead, and extend a career quite a bit... if you like being trapped inside a box.  Of course, you see a few people actually make this declaration and  mean  it, in which case, they usually fade out of the spotlight because they realize the fame is actually sucking the life out of them and they can put their talents to good use -- like helping people.    (good example of that:  Bono)  b)  "I've moved on from God to (fill in blank of mysticism, guru or combination of religion that suits my purposes)."   Again, the Christian subculture will give them tons of press as they crucify the star and the mainstream culture will embrace them temporarily because they've "come back to the fold."    c)  "I've had a drug problem since kindergarten."   Rehab is  so  chic right now.  People can identify with the triumph of overcoming an addiction.  I've been sober 9 years on July 22nd and had I known that rehab was so chic, I would have gone so I could write about it and sell some books, get my name in the headlines... oh, wait, I'm unimportant in Hollywood, so it wouldn't have done me any good anyway.    d)  Newsflash:  *Big Shot* has nervous breakdown .  The nervous breakdown can be played for a ton of sympathy and can be followed up with a triumphant return to the biz with a mediocre movie or CD.  e)  My Ex Just Got Married and it Broke My Heart .  "But, we're still best friends, we still write songs together and our children will go to the same Montessori school and also be best friends."  People eat that stuff up.  f)  "So what my girlfriend/boyfriend is 20 years older/younger than me!  We're in love!"   A good looking couple, with a tie-in to a movie, CD, or well timed scandal, can milk this for a good six weeks then renew interest during the stormy breakup and milk that for a week or two.  and last, but not least...  g)  *former child star* caught stealing Powerpuff Girls stickers from Target :  This is a good one.  First there's the public disbelief that their little precious could do something that stupid.  Then,  there's the  trial  and the community service in the children's shelter downtown.  This publicity could last for months.  That's my rant for today... I so need a job!

       FIREWORKS...   Tonight, I was here at home not feeling the greatest, my roommate was still asleep... and it rained ALL DAY in Houston... so I didn't go out to watch any fireworks.  Not wanting to offer my body up as a mosquito feast, I had pretty much decided earlier today during the monsoon to forego the fireworks and stay home.  It got to be 9 p.m. and I heard several "booms," (of the legal variety of fireworks -- for it is  illegal  to shoot off the kind of fireworks you buy along the roadside within the city limits) and they sounded fairly close.  The booms persisted, and finally, at 9:15 I stepped outside to see if I could see where they were coming from.  (I'm watching some fireworks on TV now... with the Boston Pops Orchestra, I think).    A four year old and her mother (whose Jamaican/island accent I just loved), all the while swatting mosquitoes, pointed them out for me.  I could see 3/4 of the full fireworks above the rooftops of the condo complex just north of my apartment (also between the trees).  I enjoyed about ten minutes worth of fireworks, and then they ceased.  I could hear others to the south of me, but I couldn't see them, and the four year old and her mother had retreated to their apartment and I didn't have a bra or shoes on and decided I'd better head inside myself.  I've counted three mosquito bites so far.    Fireworks displays in Houston are very impressive.  Fireworks are usually shot off at several places in town.  Two years ago, Jene' and I drove around and saw four separate displays without ever leaving the mosquito-free air-conditioned van we had borrowed from a friend.  (Last year, we were both sick -- and tired).  Fireworks also kick off the Christmas season the day after Thanksgiving.  Those fireworks are set to Christmas music and it's usually cool enough outside to actually have to wear a jacket so it almost feels like Christmas (though one year we wore shorts).  Now, I'm usually in West Texas for Thanksgiving and the 10 nieces and nephews Jene' has usually are enough fireworks themselves and I don't miss seeing fireworks at Thanksgiving anymore.  I  love  fireworks, though, and when I don't get to see them at some point during the year, I feel very sad.  I guess it's because I have so many good memories tied up in fireworks.  When I was a kid, the  Salamonie Festival  (Warren, IN) ran during the weekend of July 4th, and it still does.   My best friends would get to go to the festival with me, and we'd join my cousins and we'd take our bikes with us and ride all day, taking breaks to swim in my cousins' pond and cool off, then back into "town" (which was just a few blocks) to meet the parental units and get more cash, check in, and then we'd split to go eat dinner BY OURSELVES.  Yes, those were good times...times when you could let your kids run wild in the streets of small town America and not worry.  Later, in junior high, we'd go to Tricia's house to take a break, and also to my cousins to swim in the pond.  We'd still ride bikes, and had front row seats at the parade when we weren't in it (it's called a  PURDUE  float, people, and when your aunt and uncle have a van that has a horn that plays the  PURDUE  fight song, you decorate it, and you walk beside it in your  PURDUE  t-shirts and all of a sudden, you're in a parade with a float with an  official number  and everything).  We'd go to the waterball fights, the bed races, the canoe races, and the variety show (which now features a great number of my cousins and their children these days).  Ultimately, however, we'd all end up at the ballpark on the 4th to watch fireworks.    Granted... Warren fireworks were not as impressive as some displays I've seen since I've moved to Houston, but the amount of fireworks you saw in Warren was in direct proportion to how many people donated some money to buy them... and that is still probably the case today (and they were shot off by volunteer firemen).  I can't tell you, though, how often I am watching fireworks in other parts of the world, and I am transported back to Warren and the fireworks at the ballpark.   I'd name everybody I enjoyed that experience with but I'm sure I'll forget someone (and if you're that someone, please comment and I'll add you...), but my friends Tina and Tricia were there, along with Kristy, Brandon, Andy, Joe, and as many other people from school we could round up.   I usually had custody of my little brother, Danny, too (3 1/2 years younger).  We'd put our blankets out on the grass by the ball diamond, then we'd take turns visiting the concession stand and get the usual ballpark fare... orange push-ups, cokes, popcorn, lollies (sweetarts on a stick), and Bazooka bubble gum.  Then, as it would get dark, we'd lay back and stare at the sky until the fireworks were over.  My friends were my sanctuary, and sometimes, my salvation, so meeting up with so many of them in the middle of summer break was more important than you can imagine.  I could relax, I felt safe, and I'd get enough of an injection of hope that I could make it until school started again.  I always laughed with this group of maniacs, and the fireworks "Ooh...ahh... oh!" contests were some of my favorite times.  (Also, sharing a blanket with so many guys...one of whom I had a crush on... without my parents being anywhere too close to where I was... well, though nothing ever happened there, it was still good for the soul...lol).  But I digress...  I did defect a couple of times (in high school and after college) to the Huntington fireworks 11 miles up highway 5, but they just didn't have the same atmosphere.  I don't know when I'll ever get back to Warren on July 4th, but it's a time and place that holds a special place in my heart.  I will always think of that time in my life and my friends whenever I see fireworks.     Yes, those were great, great times.  Happy fourth everybody!

       GRACE...   Became disorganized, but obliged us with a fair amount of rain all day.  We spent all day shopping, so that was a great indoor activity.  I am very tired, so putting a sentence together is quite difficult... so I'll tune out and you can tune in later.  :)

       TROPICAL STORM GRACE   The forecast for this weekend had been highs in the low 90's, no rain... until this depression developed in the Gulf last night.  Now, the eye of  Tropical Storm Grace  spins 230 miles southeast of Corpus Christi.  Whenever the eye is south of us, this means Houston could get slammed with heavy rains.  It's called the "dirty" side of a storm.  The moisture pouring into our area is saturating the air and tomorrow (if not tonight) will be wet.    I'm glad I don't attempt tanning anymore.  This would have totally depressed me.  Of course, my roommate thinks I'm obsessed with weather like an old person, but I'm just fascinated with storms.  Don't know why...and it's not because I'm aging.  I will keep y'all updated...but I think so far, we're just due for some rain.

       AN ODE TO THE PAPER CUT   I filed all day today.  One of my jobs is to help the accounts payable clerk keep up with her paperwork.  I missed last filing last Thursday, because someone called in sick and I filled in for them instead.  Filing is the lowest rung on the totem pole, or the ladder, or something like that...  The stack was about 12 inches high.  I went as fast as I could and as a result, I have four deep paper cuts.  Fortunately for me and the purchase orders, I didn't bleed!  (I can't tell you how rare that is).  So, as I sit here, I feel as if I should pay homage to my torn cuticles and my stinging paper cuts.   Paper cut, deep and wide Why did that paper rub side to side And cut my flesh, already scarred And make me almost say a bad, bad word  Paper cut, so wide and deep Please don't bleed on me while I sleep If in my lifetime we should n'er again meet I will dance up and down my crooked street   Not the greatest ode I've ever done, but hey, I have a paper cut!  And now, I will sleep...and hopefully regain my sanity (like that's possible!).

       SQUIRREL BEER TONIC (TAKE TWO)   I did not get to check on the Squirrel Beer Tonic as planned.  The kids started out the day at orientation at school, came back at 9 a.m. and we settled in for the day.  The ozone is horrible right now, and it rained, so we stayed indoors.  Thank you, Lord, for  Animal Planet .  All three of us now know what to do if our Koi fish gets a tumor, and that there are vets at some school in Pennsylvania who can treat the fish's symptoms.  (Koi fish are Japanese goldfish on steroids if you didn't know).  If the fish had died, (these kids were so tired and wound up) I don't know what I would have done with the kids.  Had I developed an attachment to the fish, I might have been worried about myself at that point.

       SQUIRREL BEER TONIC   Today I babysat two adorable kids.  Alexandra is 7 and starts second grade Thursday.  Ian, 5, will enter kindergarten.  They returned this morning from attending a relative's wedding in England (Dad is from Cornwall) and of course, their little internal clocks are off by about 7 hours.  Apparently, they got up at 2:30 this morning...but stayed in bed, at the request of their mother until 4:30.  I arrived on the scene at 7:15 (that's  really  early for a night owl like me) and they had been up nearly 3 hours, had breakfast, and were in full gear.  Morning children + non-morning babysitter = somewhat controlled chaos.  After lunch at 9:15, we played for a while, then tried to watch a movie on the new TV.  New TV doesn't play nice with widescreen DVD's and Shrek's head was cut off in several scenes.  Alexandra, usually quite the patient tender heart, refused to watch the movie under these circumstances.  I thought if I took them outside and wore them out, they might take a nap.  HA HA    The kids have a nice play area and under the platform for the slide is a nice picnic table.  Once we were outside, Alexandra got a bucket and started picking up fallen nuts (I have no idea what kind of tree this was) from the driveway.  She managed to find almost a bucket full, then hauled it over to the picnic table.   She filled another bucket with water while Ian filled another bucket with wood chips from the play area.    Alexandra put a few nut shells in the water and stirred them with a stick (the stick adds its own flavor, you know) and then put all of the nuts in and flushed the water out, (the distillation process)  and then repeated the process.  I asked her what she was making and she said, "Squirrel Beer Tonic," which helps suqirrels with tummy aches.  I see a big career involving chemistry for this one.   She added some flower petals (the secret ingredient) and then added wood chips for that wood aged taste.  It's firmenting overnight.  I'll let you know how it turns out...

       READ THE DIRECTIONS  AND  EMPTY THE BOX   Three weeks ago, Jene' purchased a PUR water filter for our kitchen faucet.  The filter has sat on our counter all this time because we needed an adapter so the filter would thread onto our faucet.    Tonight, Jene' and I stopped by the hardware store and she purchased the adapter.  She had already read the directions (she says the directions said, "Get an adapter,") ... and so she put the thing together, I tightened it on, and voila!  We have purified water straight from the faucet.  Jene' just died laughing downstairs... a sustained fit of laughter that made me curious enough to go downstairs and make sure she was okay.    Turns out there was an adapter for the faucet in the bottom of the box.  I guess the directions failed to mention it was provided  inside .    MORAL OF THE STORY : Read the directions  and  empty the box!  LOL    (No, really, Jene' is usually the one I ask how to do things because I know she does read directions... and I'm the blonde one!)

       COMPUTER OWNERS' PLEDGE   I  will  download virus protection software  and  run it  at all times .  I  will  check Windows Update on a weekly basis  and  download  all  the security packs suggested.  I  will  do a backup (at  least  once a month) of documents, pictures, my address book, and other things that are a pain in the bum to replace and reassemble.  I  will  toss my cookies, delete my temporary internet files, and do other maintenance on my computer on a  regular basis .  I  will  resist the urge to purchase an Apple computer in self defense.  I  will  hug all IT personnel the next time I see them walking down the hallway after saving my computer and all my hard work on the job...again.  I  will  hug my rooomate/friend/brother/neighbor who fixes my computer at home... again... every time I forget to do one of the above and a virus or worm bites me in the bum.   If I fail to do any of the above, may I never log onto the internet again.    Repeat as many times as necessary ... (because my roommate is tired from fixing everybody's computers this week! So far, she's saved  23 ... and 24 will be saved as of Saturday)  I already adhere to this pledge (though I didn't until I bought my current computer), but this is for all the people who woke up Tuesday and found that their computers wouldn't work.  I've already experienced the horror of almost losing everything on my computer...  and I will do everything in my power to make sure it doesn't happen again.  I also just want to say that all the people who have issues with Bill Gates need to get a grip and leave me out of their fits of petty jealousy or whatever it is they think they're accomplishing.  I'd love to run into one of these hackers, punch them in the face and say, "Hack this!"

       THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS   Today, I went to the museum (it's free on Thursdays) to see paintings and art by James Rosenquist.  Here's a little blurb about him:   An internationally recognized artist since his emergence on the New York art scene in the early 1960s, James Rosenquist (born 1933) was a leading player in the American Pop movement. He began painting as a commercial billboard painter in the Midwest. Rosenquist developed his own brand of the "new realist" style by fragmenting, combining, and juxtaposing images from advertising onto large-scale canvases. Through this technique, Rosenquist has created complex, enigmatic narrative and abstract paintings.   You can see some of his paintings at  www.mfah.org . Click on  current exhibition .  (We also viewed some cool ornamental gold pieces and tribal headdresses from all over the world).    Rosenquist's style is sort of psychadelic Picasso and really isn't my cup of tea, but next month's exhibition has paintings by Claude Monet, Vincent Van Gogh and Salvador Dali... so I'm all over that one.  I had fun, though.  It was cool in the museum and very quiet and I tried to imagine what was going on in Rosenquist's head... I mean, about half of the paintings I saw featured lipstick... so that led me to interesting thoughts.  I'm not sure it was Amy's cup of tea, either, but hey, we were cultural for an hour and a half for  free  and that's worth something.  Next week on the day I'm not working, I'm thinking about going for a walk at the zoo.  The zoo costs $2, and without children, I can actually spend time at each exhibit and even read about the animals.  If I go early enough, I should be able to avoid heat stroke.  :)

       BLACKOUT   One of the hottest days of the year...  and ...   It's about 8:30 p.m. and I am in my room getting ready to blog about how hellishly hot it is and Jene' is in her room transferring files and BOOM!  The electricity flashes on and off, then back on again.  This ordinarily wouldn't be a problem, except the a/c is running full blast, the dryer is on and the washer is mid spin cycle.  Since this is an old apartment complex and the place is not wired for such electrical activity... the electricity stays off... in my half of the apartment.    My half of the apartment is also wired to run the air conditioner.  The washer comes to a screeching halt.  The dryer continues to run, after all, it is a different voltage and therefore separate.  Jene's room still has power, though it grows hotter by the minute as her two computers trade about 9 gigs of information furiously.  The first call to the maintenance guy is taken at 8:40.  Jene' calls at 9:15, 9:40 and is about to call at 10:40 when the maintenance guy gets around to tripping the breaker.  In Houston, especially during a heatwave, any maintenance calls for a/c are treated as emergencies, and usually, when we do trip a breaker, within 15 minutes it is restored.  Needless to say, we were a little restless until the a/c was turned back on.  But now... we're cooling off.  Jene's room had gotten quite toasty with her two computers churning and the dryer running below her downstairs.  It's getting better now, but the a/c will be on full blast for a couple of hours, I'm sure.  I'm about to tempt fate and throw my clothes in the dryer and start another load of laundry (yes, in my jammies).    Good night!

       SIZZLE, SIZZLE...   It's now 7 p.m. and it's still 102 degrees outside.  When I got home an hour ago, it was 106.  The only factor that even remotely makes me feel any better about this is that the humidity is under 30%.  (This time of year, the norm is between 80-100%).  In fact, this summer, the humidity has been below 50% quite often, which has actually made not having a/c in my car a little bit more bearable.     Today, however, by the time I got home, I was soaking wet, despite the low humidity.  I got a smidge of sunburn on my arms through the windshield, too.  I am so happy I have no hair on my neck now!  (The  'do  got rave reviews at work today... from the women.  The men looked at me as if to say, "I know there's something different, but I don't know what it is, so I'm not going to say anything.")  My roommate, who is still car-less (see blog: Thursday, May 29, 2003) has decided to go to MicroCenter... which is about 2.5 miles from here.  She will walk about a half mile to the bus stop and ride from there.  She has to get a cord to connect her old computer with the new computer so old computer can go bye bye Saturday.  It's down to 101 degrees... I hope there's a breeze.  The sun is lower on the horizon, so now it's 100 degrees.  You know it's hot when you're excited to see it dip below 100 degrees...  It's time to get some work done... I will blog atcha later!

       SHEARED   Three years ago, Jene' convinced me to buy a "big girl bed," which meant replacing my 11 year old twin mattress and elevated wooden bed frame (3 1/2 feet off the ground) with a  new  queen size bed.  I have not regretted this decision, though I do miss all the storage I had under my bed.  Today, I got my "big girl haircut," which means my shoulder length hair is now a short, short bob.  I actually really like it, and the cut is very good and will grow out nicely, so I got my money's worth (which wasn't much because I can't afford a  salon  haircut right now).  I also had to finish off the damage of the home perm I got this spring which fried my baby fine hair.  So, I'm down to mostly healthy hair and it's easy to take care of... and it's the shortest it's been since I demanded my waist length hair be chopped off in the third grade.  The funniest part of this whole experience was the photo shoot we did in the living room so I could send out pics to friends and family.  I made all sorts of faces, and had fun with it.  Then I tried to send the picture out at the size Jene' shot them at (high resolution) and they were oh, about 1.1 MB each.  LOL.  Nobody needs to see me that up close and personal!  And, since I've had DSL for a few months, I also forget how long it takes to download one of those pictures!  To all those people who received that huge file... I'm so sorry.  Though I have this fancy new haircut, it did not decrease my blonde-ness  at all .  Well, it's time to go figure out what I'm going to wear to work tomorrow to debut the new 'do...

       WHERE WAS THE PLUS SIZE HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I NEEDED IT?   Many of you have probably read about Harvey Milk High School, the publicly funded high school in New York City created  specifically  for gay, bi & transgender students. (read here: http://www.msnbc.com/news/945134.asp) I won't debate the moral implications here.  I just want to know how segregation of any sort is a move forward in any group's desire to be equal, mainstreamed, or accepted.  In my opinion, this is a huge step backward from their goal of equality.    The main reason for this high school is so the students won't have to endure persecution, teasing, or harassment.  Not to belittle anyone's feelings, but, "So what?"  Some measure of teasing and harassment is a part of high school.  I was a shy, overweight kid... and I got made fun of all the time.  I mean, if someone had approached me about Plus Size High, in principle, it may have sounded like a good idea at the time... but if you are overweight, shy, a nerd, wear glasses, wear braces, or have a face covered with zits -- you're going to get teased.  If you're beautiful, popular, into sports or one of the rich kids... you're still going to be teased.  Of course, I am not saying teasing is right.  I'm just saying, for the most part, it happens --  everywhere .    Teasing happens in private schools, for even in private schools, everyone is not equal.  Someone always has more money or brains.  Teasing happens in Christian schools, for even in Christian schools, not all kids are equal.  Some kids in Christian schools are fat.  Some come from broken homes.  Some kids have more money than others.  Some are there on scholarship.  Teasing happens everywhere, regardless of whether it's a private, Christian, public school, or the playground.    Therefore, I think that this little experiment of a alt. sexuality high school is a mistake.  Even within the walls of that "safe" environment, harassment will happen, though the labels will be a bit more different.  Too gay, not gay enough, too pretty, too butch, etc., will join the list of too fat, too thin, too smart, too dumb... Put a group of teenagers together, regardless of their sexual orientation, and they will  find  or make up things to make fun of each other about.   Methinks something else is afoot here, but I haven't decided what it is yet.  Of course, while the Christian community decries the idea of an alt. sexuality high school itself, they only have to look in the mirror to see that they, themselves, have participated in their own forms of self-segregation for years.  Christians segregate themselves every day -- Christian schools, Christian bookstores, Christian music, a Christian themepark, and now Christian housing developments are springing up everywhere.  For a group of people who are supposed to be light  in  the darkness, every day it seems those lights are running to each other and therefore, by their actions, saying, "let the darkness be damned."  And while the world keeps getting darker around them, the Christian community continues to cry about it, wondering where all their influence, voice, rights, and equality went.  For all the groups out there fighting to influence the world with their agenda... you can't do it by segregating yourselves on purpose!  You can't influence anyone if you are surrounded by people who think as you do.  You can't influence anyone if you're only broadcast to people who think as you do.  Just as Christians can't witness to their neighbors if all of their neighbors already share their faith, kids in a gay high school cannot gain acceptance with the rest of the world if they shut themselves off from the rest of the world.  Hmm... maybe if we all loved one another (and  one another  doesn't mean Christian to Christian) as He commanded us to, maybe gay kids wouldn't feel like they needed a separate place to go learn.  Just some thoughts on the subject...

       DELIRIOUS   I have a cold and a fever, but don't let that stop you from reading... I haven't let the delirium stop me from posting...   Sports:   Colts won, Texans lost...again... I also have watched way too much football lately -- spouting off sports metaphors like Dick Vitale at a Duke basketball game...   Job:   UGH.  Well, job one is still in limbo.  I'm still in the running, but they may change the job description, which is why they are still interviewing so many others, just in case they would fit the new job description, but if they don't go with the changes, then I'm it? I have no idea either.  I went on another interview for a receptionist/whatever at a small cabinet making company.  They are still interviewing, seeing if they can find anyone else who will take their small offering of salary.  Otherwise, they may give me what I want (and I didn't ask for much, just enough to get by right now).  I did the math and I can't go any lower than that.     Finances:   Pray.  They're not any better, but I guess they could always be worse.   Monitor:   Jene' helped me get a smaller, used monitor for the time being, which is a great blessing.   Outdoors:   I have a cold and a fever, which stinks, because it's a beautiful day today and the sea breeze smells so good!  Alas, I am indoors in the a/c for my own good.   Other:   Otherwise, I'm hanging in there...

       WEDNESDAY MUSINGS    Sports :  Colts won, Texans lost.  I still have the Colts picked for the Super Bowl!  It's September, so it's time for the Houston Astros to do their annual, "well, we've flirted with contending for the pennant all year long, so it's time to fade before the playoffs."  Sigh.   Job :  I actually interviewed for a really cool job -- two weeks ago.  I was actually waiting to post that so I could post the  happy happy joy joy -- woo hoo I got a job!  announcement.  I was fairly confident I had a good shot at the job after I interviewed.  The person who interviewed me even negotiated a schedule where I could give two weeks notice at my current part time job and still be trained for the new job.  She told me to go home and check out the company's benefits online, familiarize myself with the company, etc.  I was definitely encouraged and excited about this job prospect.  Flexible hours, great pay, benefits, and I could wear jeans.  What more could I ask for?  Well, a decision would be nice.    Two weeks later, she's still interviewing for the job, but says I'm still a high contender.  She also said the job description may change, which is why she's doing so many interviews.  So, though I may be a contender, I may not be if the job description changes.  UGH.  I'm back in limbo, not knowing what to do.  I went through an agency and I guess I could have them put me on other jobs while I wait on this one.  All I know is I'd take a decision on their part -- either way.  I hate limbo.   Finances :  I'm too depressed to discuss them.  Today, my monitor faded on me (came back on after I slammed my fist up against it -- must have a short), and there wouldn't have been much I could do about replacing it.  I did, after all, buy some groceries Monday night, thus depleting all of my extra money (as if I ever have any - ha ha) until some time in October, or until I get a better paying job.   Writing :  As always, whenever I get a good head of steam on something creative that I do on the computer -- the computer (or something related to it) freaks out.  Therefore, I am looking into hooking up the computer to my tv as an alternative in case the monitor goes out again.  Meanwhile, I am working on some freelance things and other opportunities I will share with you as the plans become more solid.   Outdoors :  Actually went outdoors yesterday.  Walked to the park, shared the area with four  old  ladies and their tiny, barking furballs (I assume they are acutally dogs), got a little sun (good vitamins), listened to some good music and tiny barking furballs.  Last night had splitting sinus headache from being outdoors.  Not sure which is the better tradeoff... sun vs. splitting headache.   Weather :  It's been sunny, highs in the mid 80's, lower humidity, not bad for going outside to trade off mild headache for sinus splitting one.  And, that's the end of my updates for now.  If my monitor cooperates, I will keep you updated.  :)

       WARS, RUMORS OF WARS...  AND THE HOUSTON TEXANS TAKE THE SEASON OPENER AGAINST MIAMI  AT  PRO PLAYER STADIUM!   A Super Bowl may not be in their immediate future, but the  Texans  not only  showed up  today, they more than resembled a pro football team, too.  Now I'm tuning in to see if the  Dallas Cowboys  even show up (though they are playing the Vick-less Falcons, so they have a chance).    I might add that the  Indianapolis Colts  also won today, though, from all reports I've read, they almost forgot to show up.  I'll let this slide, because many analysts have them picked for the Super Bowl (which is in Houston this year).  Even though many in my posse do not believe...  I believe.   And, as we've already established in the history of my blogdom, it  is  all about me... wait... we've established it's  not  about me, but I still believe anyway.  And, I will add this footnote:  Screaming + sore throat =  bad, very bad idea .  I only screamed twice in the first half, but that was enough to bring me great, great pain.  After a popsicle donated by my roommate, I had to resort to loud clapping instead.  Now my hands hurt.  I can't win, but the Texans and Colts did!!

       SATURDAY...   Today, Jene' and I had planned a quiet day.  Jene's been sick since Thursday (flu) and my allergies are making my throat feel as if it's on fire.  So, around 2:00 we get this call from Jene's brother-in-law -- he's in town and he wants to stop by.  (Actually, he wanted to go out to lunch, but since Jene's had the flu -- not a good idea).  I can only imagine what people thought of his license plates on first glance (State Official/SO 12).  In other words, if you see any  scandalous  headlines about Texas' highest ranking Hispanic elected official making  house  calls in Houston (to two little white women), they're not true.  He has his own little white woman in Austin.  Later in the day, our friend Nestor, who is moving to Florida at the end of this month, took us out to dinner.  Jene' had a very bland baked potato.  I had shepherd's pie (and my throat is still on fire).  Then we came back here and talked for a while, then Nestor went home to a barrage of e-mails from us about churches in the Melbourne, FL area, as well as where he could find Chinese food (6 places within a 46 mile radius).  Melbourne is a small town compared to Houston.  I'm sure he's in for some culture shock.   Now I'm feeling rather sleepy, except for this sore throat.

       THE CHRISTMAS PICKLE   Yes, you read that right... I am going to write about a pickle.   Why?    Jene' and I were shopping today and we were looking at ornaments.  I noticed a  pickle  ornament and chuckled.  Jene' told me it was a traditional ornament and one of her heritages (German, Scottish, Irish) put  pickles  on their trees.  Of course, she bought one to put on our tree.  Curiosity got the best of me and I called upon my friend, Google, to help me understand the enigma of the Christmas Pickle.  Here's where Google sent me ( urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/home/sallinger/holidayhouse/christpickle.htm ).  According to this website, the legend of the Christmas pickle comes from this story:   The Medieval tale of the pickle tells of two Spanish boys traveling home from boarding school for the holidays.  Weary from travel, they stop at an inn for the night.  The inn keeper, a mean and evil man, steals the boys' possessions, and stuffs the boys into a pickle barrel.  That evening, St. Nicholas stops in for a rest at the inn, and becomes aware of the boys' plight.  He taps the pickle barrel with his staff, and the boys are magically restored.  The boys thank St. Nicholas, and continue happily home for Christmas.    Okay, I think, much like many Christmas traditions, this little tale yielded marketable dividends, namely, a glass blown ornament (Production of the blown glass Christmas ornament started in the1890's).  Apparently, it's a kick for kids to hunt for this little ornament on the tree, for if they find it first, they either get to open their presents first, get whatever present they want, or get an extra present...depending on which website's info you choose to believe, and the financial status of the family.    Granted, many of the most...unique... Christmas traditions are German, so being of German/Swiss descent, I should have been aware of this little piece of Deutsche Christmas Lore, but alas, I was clueless.   Therefore, I wanted to educate the rest of you so you can run to the store and get Christmas Pickles to put on your tree.    I prefer dill.  :)

       PIECES OF METAL IN TIRE NOT A GOOD SIGN   I noticed it last night.  Shiny, menacing, small... protruding from my right front tire.  A sharp spike embedded in the rubber like a nail through my heart.  I don't know if it's Murphy's Law, the law that says, "Oh yeah, she has no money, let's get her!" or just one of those days.  UGH.  When I purchased these tires at Discount Tire almost three years ago, I bought the little "free replacement" guarantee with those tires.  Remembering this gave me new life this morning.  I'm still not sure if I'll be able to afford the flu shot tomorrow, but I'm closer now than I was when I discovered that long, shiny, metal intruder on my tire.  I drove down to Discount Tire (slowly and carefully, I might add) and made it without incident.  I went to the counter and told the guy, "I have a right front tire going down.  It's got a nail in it, I think.  When you're finished, can you put the two best tires in front?"  The guy blinks at me, like he didn't understand the words coming out of my mouth.  I realized that he probably thinks all women are dumb about things like this, and in sounding intelligent, I confused him.  I turned on my blonde and said, "Sir, there's a little silver thingy in my tire on the passenger's side and I think there's air leaking out of it.  Can you fix it?"  I tried to resist twisting my hair around my finger and tilting my head, but I couldn't.  If I'd been chewing gum, I promise you I would have smacked it loudly and made that dumb blonde noise when I was finished.  As I stopped talking the light in the guy's eyes came on and he nodded and asked if I had purchased the tires there.  Sheesh.  My friend Lee Ann from Tulsa and I used to go into the auto section of say, Wal-Mart and announce our presence.  "Blondes in automotive!" and Lee Ann, who does the dumb blonde noise perfectly, would add that and a giggle at the end.  Lee Ann probably knows more about cars than I do, but we just loved to see how many guys would come running toward us to "help" us after we'd made our announcement.  It was too funny.  I try not to get offended by a man's assumptions that I don't know anything about "his" world.  I just keep quiet until he assumptions his way into a corner, and then says something like, "a foul ball is when the batter hits the ball on the other side of that chalky white line," or "a pair of pliers is that tool that's pointy at the end."  He then sits back and smiles, thinking he's done his part by informing me of how much he knows about manly things --  thus leaving himself wide open for me to openly mock him.  (In the Southern way, of course -- the way a Southern woman mocks someone and they don't know it for hours, or perhaps  ever ).  After his assumption is in a sling, I simply make a truthful, consise statement showing that my other  x  chromosome, perhaps, is a little short, thus resembling, but not imitating, a  y,  or that I, perhaps, might (gasp) understand what he's been talking about, or what's going on in the game.   I've found that men  ass ume that most women know nothing about:  a) cars b) sports c) barbecue (like cooking outdoors makes it  different ) d) everything else   except   those tasks that require an apron, a stove, or sewing machine... and they'll give us credit for having the knowledge of how to take care of those screaming, needy entities that emerged from our wombs  If you're a man, and you're reading this and you're a little miffed at my blatant "anti y-chromer" overtones, I ask you to remember how outraged, angry and small you feel right now... the next time you assume anything about what a particular woman does or doesn't know.  And if you're  really  nice and treat me like the intelligent princess I am, when you ask me for my phone number, I might give you my real one and not the number to the prayer line at church.  The Cubs just blew a three run lead.  I have to go now.  Hopefully, they'll get it together and I can put my sackcloth and ashes away.

       THE COLTS  ROCK  AND THE CUBS NEED TO QUIT GIVING ME HEART ATTACKS   Though it is only the 5th inning in the Cubs NLCS playoff game, they are up by 10 runs, so unless they self destruct, they will tie the series tonight.  Whew.  And, if you missed the Colts/Bucs game on Monday Night Football... call ABC and order the tape.  (Fast forward to the fourth quarter... until there's about five minutes left to go in the game).     Jene' picked the Bucs to win in her football pool (she'd been perfect so far this year) and I kept  insisting  that the Colts would win (I'm intensely loyal, even during lost cause years -- for the Colts that would be every year since they moved to Indy until Peyton came along) and she openly mocked me until the fourth quarter.  Then she told me to go to bed and to take my sorry Touchdown and Extra Point Monkeys (Colts toys) with me.  So with 5 minutes left in the game, after Peyton threw an interception for a touchdown to bring their deficit to 21 points, I was near tears.  My Colts were going to lose for the first time this season.       I was wound up from the game, so I took two Tylenol PM so I could get to sleep.  I was getting sleepy, then the Colts started putting on a clinic as Tampa apparently thought they had won the game and went to sleep.  I had a tough time staying awake until overtime, but I made it.  The Tylenol kept me from screaming as much, but I was jumping up and down in my room.   Peyton Manning is the MAN .  I didn't gloat to Jene'  too  much.  :p  Okay... back to back homeruns for the Marlins in the 6th.  Come on, Cubbies.  Harry Caray is turning over in his grave.  Don't let this one slip away!  No Tylenol PM for me tonight... no way.  I might miss something.

       SUNSHINE AND RAISINS   Let me just say that we've had beautiful weather here the past week.  Temps in the low 80's, low humidity, temps around 60 at night, lots of sun... wonderful fall weather for Houston.    Yesterday, I decided to go for a walk and sit out in the sun for a half hour or so.  Our apartment complex is surrounded by condos.  In the middle of these condos is a nice little park that, during the day, is mostly filled with old ladies walking their "dogs" (any canine that weighs less than 10 pounds and has a higher pitched bark than a toddler imitating them... I don't consider dogs).  I have gone to this park several times over the past two years and have never been bothered, nor bothered anyone else.  So, much to my surprise, I was approached by an old lady (hereafter called, "The Raisin,") wearing dark sunglasses and an attitude on her wrinkled face.  She was accompanied by a "dog," who quite frankly looked too skittish to bark.  The Raisin looked at me and said, "I haven't seen you around here, do you live here?"  I replied, no, that I lived in the apartment complex across the street.  She immediately frowned further than she already had been and said, "you're trespassing, so you need to leave  now ."  She hastily explained to me about the signs I ignored (there are a couple of signs about no solicitation and no trespassing, but my roommate and I walk through this complex a lot -- it's off the street and safer -- and like I said, I've used that park bench many times) and then she told me that I should leave immediately or she would call the police.  I said, "okay, ma'am," (see, I was nice) and got up and walked home.  The Raisin followed me to the street and made sure I walked out of the complex.  Nice lady.  Now, granted, technically, she was right.  I didn't live there, so technically, I was trespassing.  There are no gates on this community, so it's not like it's totally private and the security officer has waved at me a time or two, so I didn't think I was hurting anybody.  The thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that for two years any other time I've been there, most of the old ladies stopped by, said hi, introduced me to their "dogs" and walked off.  Many other times I have been the only person in the park.  I have never bothered anyone, made loud noise, or disturbed anyone with loud music.  I am not dangerous looking by any means.  I don't wear offensive clothing.  My presence was not disturbing to anyone I'd met in previous encounters.  I really believe this Raisin just wanted to be mean.  That's what bothers me.  I felt sorry for her, though.  She smiled at me, a gloating smile, like she'd done something powerful or meaningful, but all she'd done is be mean.  And while I didn't necessarily need her meanness yesterday, I don't need her bench.  I can go somewhere else to sit outdoors (albeit farther away) but she still has to live with her meanness and need for power.  I hope she's happy, having thrown me out of her park, but I doubt that happiness or satisfaction lasts.

       HAPPY THANKSGIVING!   It's going to be a busy week, so I'm doing this now just in case I get too busy... See?  I'm making perfect sense already.  Wednesday after work, Jene' will pick me up and we will drive 6 + hours to San Angelo for Thanksgiving.  The actual Thanksgiving feast is Friday, so we will have Thanksgiving Day to prepare the feast.  Jene's mom had carpal tunnel surgery on her wrist this week, so Jene' and I will be in charge of the kitchen.  Scratch that (in case some of you just had heart attacks...).  Jene' is in charge of the kitchen, which means she is in charge of all things that I can hurt myself with (i.e. knives) and I will follow her instructions.  If I was in charge of the kitchen, one of the essential ingredients would be a first aid kit and my Betty Crocker (this is how you boil water) cookbook.    Now... don't think I  can't  cook.  I can.  I cook quite well.  I just don't cook well under  pressure .  Saturday night dinner at my house is no pressure.  Thanksgiving (including large fowl in oven and something to do with cranberries, and expectations involving cornbread stuffing)  is  pressure.  So, one of my I'm thankful for's is Jene' is in charge of the kitchen.  I have to do an  I'm thankful for  blog entry because this is my first Thanksgiving with a blog.  After this year, I'll probably adopt the notion that the  I'm thankful for  blog entry is blaise' or something.  We'll see.  So...   I'm thankful for...  (in no particular order)      - little girl giggles       - pasta and other cheap eatables      - the work I  have  had      - Garnier Nutrisse #101 (Sugar Cane)      - the "just because," "how are you?" and random e-mails and etceteras from friends all over the country      - Lindor chocolate truffles (good for the soul) and all other chocolate foods      - my car... it still runs and even without a/c, I'm grateful for it (and we're driving it to West Texas, so PRAY HARD)      - reasonably good health (seriously, it could be worse and I just don't want to go there)      - my West Texas based family       - creative inspiration      - God's provision, both immediate and 11th hour (Yes, I'm going to write a book about it someday)      -  Jene'   (If I start listing all the reasons why, I'll start crying and I won't be able to stop)  I'm sure I'm forgetting numerous people and things, but that's the list that I came up with off the top of my head.  I also thought of tons of little things, and they are too numerous to list here, but it got me to thinking that all those little things add up and help me get through the days where I feel like nothing is going right... and I've had plenty of those this year.  Enjoy your turkey and mashed potatoes and be thankful.  If you're stuck with your dysfunctional family on this particular holiday, you can still be thankful -- you get to leave and go back home.  If you are with a functional family, you'd better be thankful, period.  If the turkey is dry, be thankful that you'll still be full within the hour.  Just be thankful about  something .  Otherwise, you've missed the whole point of Thursday and a lot of other days as well.  Happy Thankful Day!

       RAIN, RAIN, GO AWAY  AND TAKE THE TORNADOES WITH YOU...   Today was a long, long day on the switchboard.  Not only do we have two major events this week (plus a church wide dinner Sunday evening) and the Christmas program in 3 1/2 weeks, but Houston began to flood around 11 a.m. this morning, shortly following the first tornado in Sugar Land (southwest suburb of Houston).  Therefore, in addtion to the high volume of calls I usually get, I received phone calls from panicked parents and people with events scheduled for the evening.    The church I work for usually gets "flooded in" during heavy, heavy rains.  The freeway and access roads all flood, our parking lot floods, and the surrounding streets flood, and nobody can get in or out.  It was reported, shortly before 1 p.m. that the access roads were flooding, but they made us stay at work, thinking, if the rain let up, we would be able to exit the parking lot by 4:30 p.m.    So... at 3 p.m. many people (esp. parents -- we have a daycare and elementary/middle school) became genuinely concerned that we were all stuck there and they couldn't get through.  I was upset because people were told to leave at that point (though they had to stay b/c there was nowhere for them to go) and I wasn't.  UGH... and I'm part time and I need EVERY hour I can get... so I didn't put up much of a fuss.  Many people ventured out about 3:30, calling me and telling me how bad it was out there, and telling me to send out e-mails advising people what routes  not  to take.  Finally, my supervisor's secretary came out and told me we were leaving at 4:15 so we'd have some daylight to see to get home.  It didn't rain for about a half hour, which helped the water level go down enough so many of us could leave the building.  Granted, this flood is nothing compared to Allison (June, 2001) during which we got our yearly average total of rainfall (38") in two days... but slap a few tornadoes on top of all this rain and it's a mess out there.   I have friends who got home 2 hours later than usual, but all are safe.  It only took me a half hour or so to get home (it takes 15 minutes) but I live in an area of town that is actually above sea level and not near a bayou.    Another band of thunderstorms are headed this way, but I should be able to get to work tomorrow.  :)  I should hear some interesting stories when I get there!

       WHODA THUNK?   * The Colts (7-1) before play today... would get beat by the Jaguars who were 1-7 before they beat the Colts.  UGH!!  * The Cowboys would be a playoff caliber team this year.  I personally can't believe it, but they said it on TV, so it must be true.  * A nice, respectable guy would win the NASCAR championship this year with only 1 win. (Congrats, Matt Kenseth)  * Purdue is in the top 10 in the college football poll!  WOO HOO!  * I haven't blogged about snow yet this fall.  * A member of my family made it into the news media in a  positive  light (ha ha):  My cousin's wife is in this week's (Nov. 10)  Time  magazine on page 71.  All right, Dr. Liza!   * I will be working every day until Thanksgiving (woo hoo)!  L8R!

       GENESIS VS. EXODUS    Genesis:   a new beginning  Exodus:   departure, exit, withdrawal  I feel like I've had too much exodus lately.  People have made their exodus (in many ways) from my life.  Jobs and financial security have made their exodus as well.  I've experienced a church fellowship exodus, a friendship exodus, a health exodus, a motivation exodus, a confidence exodus, and a general well being exodus -- to name but a few of my recently experienced exoduses.  Some of the exodus has been by me, some of the exodus has been by others.  Too much exodus in my opinion, regardless of which direction it came from.  I was reading  The Message  this morning -- Psalm 51.  I don't know what made me turn to that particular Psalm, but as is the usual effect of  The Message , a sentence jumped out at me in a new way (and since I don't have the newest version of  The Message  that actually numbers the verses, I can only tell you I think it's verse 10).   God, make a fresh start in me, shape a Genesis week from the chaos of my life.     When I think of Genesis, I think of God speaking the world into existence --  a world where everything was new, clean, full of promise and purpose.  When I think of a personal genesis, I think of starting over, a personal rebirth, a new direction.    I've experienced symptoms, if you will, or seen indicators of a genesis about to happen -- after all, my world has exploded in the last couple of years, nothing looks the same as when I began this journey -- but I still feel dead inside.  It's been a painful process that's left me feeling like I'm still stuck in the chaos of my life, waiting for that final push, that last day, where the sun comes out and birds start singing and God reaches down and breathes life into me.  Forgive me if I wish he'd just hurry up and breathe already, because I'm tired of pinching myself to a) make sure I'm not sleeping and this isn't all just a horrible nightmare, or to b) make sure I'm not too numb and can at least still feel something.  Everybody has a season like this.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I've been here before and I've been through the genesis.  I know what it feels like -- it's not that far removed from my memory -- and I know it's coming again.  I'm just anxious for it, more than I have been in a long, very long time.  Something has to change, to give, to budge, to move... but it all starts with the breath of God.     God, make a fresh start in me, shape a Genesis week from the chaos of my life ...(and a verse later)  Bring me back from grey exile, put a fresh wind in my sails!  (breathe! exhale!)

       HAPPY NEW YEAR!!   2003 will end in a few minutes.  I don't make resolutions any more, but I feel more resolved than usual.  I'll leave it at that.  I am enjoying my evening of football and occasional ventures downstairs to see what the roommate is up to.  She made pecan caramel candy and it was very tasty while warm, but we are still out of karo syrup, so the candy turned hard rather quickly.   Imagine, if you will... the roommate attacking said candy with large, stainless steel knife to remove it from glass 9 x 13 pan.  Both of us have broken teeth... so the pecan caramel jawbreakers are now in the wastebasket.  I hope wherever you are, you did something that you enjoyed tonight -- whether that means you stayed home alone, ate some popcorn (or chocolate) and watched Dick Clark (who just now nearly exclaimed, "Happy Birthday!" instead of "Happy New Year!" to one of his co-hosts) or you danced the night away with dozens of other people, spent the night with your family or curled up on the couch with your honey and watched a movie.  May the new year bring you all you hope for and the wonderful delights you couldn't have created in your wildest dreams that will surprise your socks off.    Happy New Year!

       MERRY CHRISTMAS! -- IT'S THE KITCHEN PROGRESS REPORT    CHRISTMAS EVE SERVICE :  We arrived at 6:55 for the 7:00 service.  Sat in the chairs added in the aisle -- you know, the ones added for the late people.  The service was good, highlighted by great music and a little boy who sang, "Away in a Manger," with such confidence it was moving.  Afterward, we made it to Kroger before it closed at 9:00 for Christmas Eve to get some last minute items.   FOOD :  The turkey is thawing in the bathtub and must be turned over and the water changed out in a about a half hour.  It has to start cooking in five hours, so I hope it's thawed by then.  Strawberry cake cookies and the rice crispy bars are baked, the cranberry sauce is finished and the stuffing is ready to be cooked.  The pecan pie is... well... about an hour ago, Jene' started to make the pie and the karo syrup she bought a couple of weeks ago is  moldy .  (HEB is getting a letter I bet).  Of course, it's after midnight, and even in Houston almost everything shut down early tonight and will not reopen until tomorrow afternoon.  After deciding the corner convenience store, if open, would most likely  not  carry karo syrup, Jene' decided to improvise with some honey, maple syrup and a little karo syrup from  another  bottle she had (but only about a third of what she needed).   Rolls, mashed potatoes and the turkey will be cooked after we wake up.  I'm pretty sure Jene' won't get much sleep tonight because the pie has to cook an hour and someone needs to be awake to make sure it gets taken out of the oven.  Jene' has felt better and has done a good portion of the actual cooking.  I, of course, busied myself with stirring things, and cleaning up behind Jene'.     INJURIES :  Ahem.  It is  me , remember?  Actually, I'm not alone on the injury report tonight.  Jene' slammed her thumb in a door and her thumbnail is sorta blue.  I stubbed my toe on the chair we moved away from the table and placed by the kitchen door... and for some reason, when furniture gets moved, I have trouble navigating until I injure myself and therefore I pay special attention not to run into the particular offending piece of furniture again.  We're fairly confident my toe is not broken, but it aches and is swelling a bit on top.  Another night for the memory book, eh?  Elizabeth and Corinne will be here around 12:30 for lunch.  We will have a great time and eat some good food... and while everyone else sleeps in Friday... I'll be at work... probably reading a book.    I hope your day is filled with good times, good food, and lots of Kodak and memory moments.  :)

       FROHLICHE WEINACHTEN   ...that is...  Merry Christmas!   I have the next two days off and then go back to work Friday.  If anyone can explain to me why a church would be open the day after Christmas when there will be about, oh, 10% of the staff present and maybe four people will bother to call or come into the church... please, fill me in.  Not that I'm not grateful for the work ('cause if I don't work, I don't get paid), I just think instead of Wednesday & Thursday off... most people would rather have had Thursday & Friday off (and not had to take a vacation day)... but that's just me.  Now, with that  bah humbug  out of the way, the Roommate and I are going grocery shopping shortly.  As I cruised by the grocery store (actually both of them -- we have two about a half mile from the apt) at 5 p.m., both parking lots were FULL so I came on home.  If it's one thing that gets under my skin at Christmas -- it's impatient crowds of people all fighting for the same parking spot and hot sale item.  The Roommate is also sick, which translates into  me  being very busy in the kitchen cooking tomorrow night under the careful tutilage of the Roommate.   Like I've said before... I like to cook... but cooking under pressure is not enjoyable.  Of course, it's just the Roommate, my friend Elizabeth, her daughter Corinne and me for Christmas dinner, so there's not  that  much pressure.    Ha ha... it should all be fine and yummy.  Just in case I don't get to say it before Thursday, may you have a safe and joyous Christmas.  If you find yourself pondering what I'm pondering (trying to wrap the human brain around the notion that God sent his son in human form to us to live on earth and then offer himself as atonement for our sins and thus offer us eternity with him...well, it's not as easy to ponder as it may seem), then post your ponderings.  I'd be interested in reading them.  FYI... it will be 65 degrees and rainy in Houston Thursday.  If you are enjoying a white Christmas, think of me.  If you get a little adventurous... make me a snowman and send me a picture of it (with the snowman maker included) and I'll put it in my collection!  Feliz Navidad!

       A BLONDE MOMENT    I finally have antibiotic drops and the eyes are improving. That's the good news. The funny,  holy cow, I can't believe you did that  news is that I thought I was going blind yesterday when I was in the shower.   My eyes fogged up and I screamed and yelled for Jene' (who was downstairs and did not hear me) that something was wrong with my eyes. Turns out I had left my glasses on and they had fogged up while I was in the shower.   After I finished laughing at myself, I apologized to blondes everywhere for representing them badly and stereotypically.   Sometimes I wonder about myself!

       NOT SURE IF IT'S PINKEYE...   ...but my eyes are sure red.  My blue irises are surrounded by a pool of red... both eyes.  Granted, I have horrible allergies, but usually the allergy eye drops do the trick.  Not so this morning.   I am going to get some antibiotic drops Monday to put in my eyes, so that should help.    On a brighter note, I received an early Christmas gift today and I love him.  He is  Swizzle , a stuffed toy giraffe from FAO Schwartz.   Swizzle will now kick my fascination with giraffes into a full blown obsession... which all successful writers have.  I could go for the popular obsessions, such as drinking, sex, drugs, the environment, politics, or making origami swans, but I think I'll stick with giraffes.    Now that I have an obsession, I can bypass all other weird writer phases and go straight to the top of the NY Times Bestseller List... as soon as I... ahem... get published.  Great.  I just touched my eye again and since I may or may not have pinkeye... I have to go wash my hands and hose my keyboard down with Lysol.    I'm sure all the great ones had these sorts of setbacks.

       ADVENT IN THE BAPTIST BUCKLE OF THE BIBLE BELT   My roommate is Presbyterian and I was raised Methodist, so we are both familiar with the concept of Advent.  Baptists observe the Christmas season, but do not necessarily observe the traditions of Advent.  Advent is the season leading up to Christmas Day, and is intended for our reflection and anticipation of the celebration of the birth of Christ.  Advent is celebrated starting the fourth Sunday before Christmas, so it started this past weekend.  Traditionally, Advent involves a wreath with 5 cancles (4 royal purple and 1 white or 3 royal purple, 1 pink and 1 white).  The first purple one was lit Sunday and the white one will be lit Christmas Day.    2 years ago, most of my roommate's belongings were scattered across interstate 59 during rush hour because the truck that was transporting her belongings was hit by a bigger truck (and he had no insurance).  90% of my roommate's belongings were gone, including all of her Christmas decorations (not to mention clothes, yearbooks, pictures, etc).  This year, she has managed to replace most of her Christmas decor, including a grand artificial pre-lit tree.  In keeping with the spirit of Christmas, she decides that it's time to replace her advent wreath.  Since we live in the Baptist buckle of the Bible belt, an Advent wreath has been difficult to find.  Most of the responses we've gotten as we've gone from Christmas shop to craft store are, "Advent what?"  I was about to suggest a trip to Cokesbury, a Methodist bookstore here in town when we got a postitive response at  Michael's,  a craft store near our house.  They actually had the makings of an Advent wreath, at least the base with the four candle holders (the fifth candle is placed in the center of the wreath).  Jene' wasn't sure she could decorate around this base so she opted for a plain wreath and some candle holders and a few berry wreaths to wrap around the candles.  It's a great wreath.  It never ceases to amaze me how people can take the holy days for granted... to not be able to at least try to participate in observing something that involves a belief bigger than themselves.  As the word  Christmas  is reduced to  holiday  and  seasonal  and therefore  Christmas trees  are now known as  holiday greenery  to fit the occasion to the needs of political correctness, I can't help but wonder how far down the true message of Christmas can be pushed before it begins to bubble up and boil over and explode out of the box people are trying to stuff it into.    Either celebrate Christmas or don't.  It's that simple.  Don't try to change a celebration or holy observance to fit your secular agenda.  Walk away from Christmas and spread your season's greetings... just don't try to change what has been for hundreds of years.  Just because you change the name, doesn't mean you change the true meaning of Christmas.  Just because you refer to your Christmas tree as holiday greenery doesn't change what it is -- a symbol of the celebration of Jesus' birth.

       SUPER BOWL INSANITY   The Super Bowl is a huge draw for the celebrity set.  If a celeb wants to be seen, treated as near royalty and get their picture taken and splashed across newspapers all over the country, Houston is the place to be this weekend.    So far, I have sighted not one celeb, but my life is not going to suffer for it.  The city is abuzz, however, with sightings of Madonna at  Starbuck's  on Westheimer and J-Lo retreating from the Galleria mall through the back doors of  Nieman Marcus  because she was being mobbed as she tried to shop incognito.  The members of Nsync are staying at the Hotel Derek and shopped at an undisclosed mall to avoid crowds.  Jene' asked, "why is Madonna drinking coffee at  Starbuck's  news?"  Because Madonna doesn't live here, and for reasons good or bad, she's "famous."  If Madonna lived in Houston (like Beyonce' does), drank coffee at that  Starbuck's  every Thursday morning, and shopped for groceries at HEB, then a Madonna sighting at  Starbuck's  would be no big deal.  Just for your information, I am not driving inside the loop this weekend or going anywhere near Reliant Stadium.  The traffic is already bad.   So, I am going to thaw my guac and chips and get ready for Sunday night.    Anybody want to make a guess as to who will win Sunday night?

       WELL SNOWBUNNIES, I WENT TO THE BEACH LAST NIGHT   Please don't hate me.   Well, Blogger just ate this wonderful post I just made about going to the beach last night.  It was very long and I don't want to go back and recreate it all.  Let's just say it was 75 yesterday and I was wearing shorts and my friend LaRee took us to the beach to help her collect some sand and shells for a school project (LaRee teaches preschool -- 2 year olds).  Today it was 72 but a cold wind has descended upon us and it is now in the mid 40's and should be freezing by morning.  So much for shorts weather for a week or so.  I wish I had my blog back.  I'm so sad.  There was beautiful sarcasm and everything!  Oh, well.  That's life.  Until later!

       A TALE OF BROKEN TEETH   I now have a second broken tooth... on the opposite side of the other broken tooth.  Part of this tooth broke last night while watching  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  -- no chewing involved -- and the rest while eating chips & salsa this afternoon.  Two crowns will cost $1200.  I have lived with the other broken tooth, because, while annoying, it has been tolerable.  This tooth, however, is sharp and jagged and is rubbing my tongue.  So far, the only pain is the jaggedness.  I am going to try to cover it with a temporary filling until I figure out what to do.    I know of a dentist who will let me make payments, but at my present employment status, I cannot afford the payments.  So, here are two prayer requests... a job and help in the meantime.  I guess I'm back to mainlining orajel and eating soup and oatmeal.  Until next time!  :)

       ALAS POOR COLTS   Gloom, despair... ARGH!!  Poor Indy came up short today, but I am so proud of their season!  Naysayers didn't even think they'd make it this far, but I think this is just a warmup for next season.  I'm a little upset though.  I had managed to find out where the AFC Champs would be staying for the Super Bowl...and now, who wants to "stalk" (ha ha) Tom Brady? Not me.    Next year, my Colts.  I still believe.

       SIMPLE PLEASURES   About four years ago, a friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for my birthday to get a manicure & pedicure.  (His wife's suggestion -- she said he couldn't go wrong with that gift -- so I guess I should thank her, huh).  I lost the certficate, found it, then lost it again until it resurfaced a few weeks ago.  Tuesday, I was going to the mall to exchange something, and I realized that the gift certificate said Nails Beautiful was in the  same  mall... so I thought, "why not?"    Turns out Nails Beautiful moved out of the mall some time ago, but the sweet little old ladies at the information booth told me it was just around the corner in the same building that houses Bally's.  I pressed on.  I found Bally's and finally, Nails Beautiful.    I walked in, and since it was about 2:45 in the afternoon, the place was empty.  I quickly explained the story of the gift certificate and the lady in charge said, (with thick Vietnamese accent) that she'd honor the gift certificate, but I'd have to kick in the price difference.  Apparently, the prices have gone up slightly.  No big deal.   I've never had a professional manicure or pedicure before... let alone a manicure with a SPA.  Lynn was in charge of my feet, and a woman who never introduced herself was in charge of my hands.   Conversation was minimal, because Lynn's English wasn't that strong and Miss No Name was content to just work on the hands and converse with Lynn in Vietnamese.  Lynn did ask, over the course of the 45 minutes it took to complete the work on hands & feet, what my name was, and she told me hers.  When Miss No Name walked away, she slipped me her card and told me that they worked on commission (hint: if I go back next time set up appointment with her).  She was very nice.  I absolutely loved the spa and I  love  to have my feet rubbed.  I managed to tell Lynn, without offending or scaring her, that one of my toes was broken and to try to work around it (yes, the toe I "stubbed" on Christmas Eve still hurts, especially when touched).  She did a wonderful job, and she massaged both feet, calves, and all my toes (except stubby) and exfoliated my feet as well -- all before she even worked on my toenails.   Miss No Name massaged my hands, my forearms and my fingers.  I was nearly asleep when Lynn accidentally touched my broken toe.  I managed a smile and then Miss No Name started on my cuticles.    You know, I've always believed I've taken care of my nails (toes & hands) adequately... and I would have believed that until I saw how much work these women had to do to get my hands in the condition they are now.  Lynn painted my toenails an orange color and Miss No Name put a light misty white color on my fingernails.  I wasn't too sure about putting polish on my fingernails, because I type, and I use my hands to file, etc.  Usually, whenever I paint my nails, the fingernails are ruined by the end of the day.  That's why I smooth my fingernails, but rarely paint them.  Miss No Name didn't seem like she'd be satisfied unless polish was applied, so I let her.  It was pretty until I scratched my thumbnail while getting gas about an hour later.  Oh, well.  It doesn't look that bad, and my nails are still nice and smooth.  When I left there, I went to get my hair trimmed (with the rest of my Christmas money -- woo hoo) and he cut it  really  short... but I flipped it up in the back this morning, and it wasn't so bad.  So, I guess I really did have a day of pampering after all.  I never do that, either... maybe I should do it more.  I did decide that once I get a full time job, if the budget allows, I'd like to go visit Lynn and Miss No Name at least once a month.  I guess it's because when I left there, my feet felt lighter than air, and I just  love, love, love  to have my feet rubbed!  It's one of the most relaxing things ever.  I never thought I'd like to do anything that girly, but hey, it's never to late for a change of heart.

       A TOTAL FUNNY HAPPENED TODAY...   Jene' and I went shopping today so I could finally spend some of my Christmas money & gift cards.  While in the mall, I stopped in Lane Bryant to see if they had any good sales.  When we walked in the door, the salesperson said, "is this a mother and daughter or are you two sisters?"  Granted, Jene' is 8 years older than I am, but she doesn't look it, and I look younger than I am, but not  that   much younger, so we both just kind of laughed and I went on to look at the clearance rack.  Jene' came back and said that after I had walked away, the salesperson said, "I didn't offend your sister, did I?"  and I started laughing.  She thought   I   was the mother!  (Both Jene' and I had taken it the other way around).  Jene' looks young for her age,  but ...  lol...  That was a good laugh.    It's 42 degrees and I'm debating turning the heat on again.  We just got the upstairs cooled off from the heater running all day, but my fingers are feeling a bit cold again.  And how was your day?  lol

       SAYING, "NO" UPDATE:  Everyone's acting like nothing happened.  Next.   BLOGGING, THOUGH ALREADY SPARSE, MAY BE SPARSER  Our DSL is switching over to another line, so as of Monday we'll be without high speed internet access for 5-10 days.  I will be able to access e-mails with dial-up, but whenever I try to blog with dial-up, the results are frustrating.  So, if I can blog, I will blog.  If I can't, I will talk to y'all in a couple of weeks.  Gives me a chance to catch up on correspondence and reading, right?

       STILL SATISFIED WITH SAYING, "NO."   I've had time to think and re-think and I still think I did the right thing by standing up for myself.  I've also had time to think about all the times I didn't say no and why it's still so difficult for some to use that word.  After all, "no," is one of two options, the other being, "yes."  "No" is always there, waiting to do it's job.  I'm not saying that a time to say, "yes," is wrong or doesn't exist.  I just believe, "no," isn't used enough.  Don't get me wrong, I've spent years not saying, "no."  I've spent years saying, "yes," when I should have been saying, "no," because I can't stand conflict.  I used to sacrifice my own feelings, self respect, my own rights as a human being because I couldn't say, "no."  Over the years, as I've dug deep and found my voice, it's still tough to say, "no," but I've been able to more often and let me tell you, it feels better than being a doormat.  Not saying, "no," when it needs to be said and you wake up with the words, "welcome," on your back.  I think most of the word has been erased off my back, but I think there's still a W and part of an E still visible.  I'm not always able to say, "no," even now, but I have more discernment, too, and sometimes, it's best not to say anything.  Ah, the thrid option.  The trouble with, "no," is that so many people are used to hearing, "yes," they get angry and take it personally when they don't get what they want.   I still don't know what I will face tomorrow.  Probably nothing, just silence.  Still, I have no regrets with my choice of words.  Now that I think about it, I used to say, "no," all the time, just inside my head... where I was screaming it, but nobody heard me.  In fact, I used to stand in the middle of crowded rooms screaming at the top of my lungs and nobody heard me.  Nobody was listening.  Oddly enough, some people don't hear the word, "no," even when you're brave enough to speak it out loud... calmly, respectfully.  All they hear is, "you're not getting your way."  Jene' said that as long as I am being obedient, I am not responsible for how my actions or choice of words is taken.  I am not responsible for the reaction.  No matter what the outcome, I did what was right.  No matter how high on the Black Sheep list this puts me, I did what was right.  No matter how people talk about me behind my back, I did what was right. Even if I get fired, I still did something that I should have done a long time ago -- stand up for myself.    Unfortunately, sometimes you do the right thing and you end up homeless (ha ha).  Donations can be made at...

       STANDING UP FOR YOURSELF ISN'T EASY   ...but the alternative is worse.  Today was the worst day at work I've had in a long time.  Yes, the phone was busy, but that wasn't the problem.  Yes, people were asking dumb questions 5 calls at a time, but that wasn't the problem, either.  My problem was interdepartmental politics and I was caught in the middle.  Let me peel away the layers.   The first problem  is that nobody at my company respects the position I (and another part timer) hold.  I work a busy, busy switchboard (for a company with over 200 employees) and my phone rings constantly, except for those rare occasions when it doesn't ring for a solid 15 minutes, in which case, I feel, that time is a reward for what happens in the 15 chaotic minutes afterward.  When a co-worker walks by and says hello and the phone doesn't ring in the 30 seconds that they're talking to me, they assume the phone is silent most of the time.  They are wrong.  Most also assume that answering the phone is all I do.  That is also wrong.  I do computer projects, stuff envelopes, and deal with many people who walk in off the street that need financial help or who have questions.  It is a brisk job most of the time.   The second problem  is I don't have a boss that will stand up for me.  In fact, I really don't have a boss right now at all, as that position has been open for about five years or so.   Therefore, my immediate "supervisor" isn't really in a position over me and she often chooses to try to please everybody and that leaves my back wide open, like it was today.   The third problem  is the company is in a financial crunch and the higher ups have been told to save money wherever they can.  This mandate has turned people who are normally rational into penny pinching scrooges who grasp at any opportunity to get another department to pay for whatever they can... so at the end of the fiscal year, they can come in under budget and not share responsibility for any of the company's debts.   The fourth problem  is that, at this company, if you stand up for yourself and say, "no, I don't think that is appropriate," or "no, I don't think I can/should do that," you are labeled a troublemaker and... shunned...  gossipped about...called into the "Principal's Office" and asked why you aren't a team player/enabler...why you don't "submit" to your authority no matter what it is they ask you to do.   The fifth problem  is I don't have the money to quit this part time job where I get no respect, nor do I have the faith to make that leap without another job waiting in the wings.  I am caught between a rock and a hard place and it's getting quite painful.    So with all that in mind, here is what happened today.  A supervisor from another department (which I have worked for on a contract basis previously) walks by my desk this morning and says,  "it's going to be a slow day, right?  You could do something for me, right?"       * translation:    You really don't do anything important, and could be doing something for me and since you are on another department's dime, it will save me money and give you something to do.   My first thought is, "yes, if it's something easy, why not?" but then she tells me that it's a form that she needs reworked and it's about four pages long.         * translation:    I can get several hours work out of you and not have to pay for it.   Now, this woman (for simplicity's sake, let's call her  Betsy  - not her real name) knows that I need money and that I am available at least two days a week to come in and do projects for her.  This project, by the way, is not an emergency, just something that she thought of that I could do.  I see that it is not a simple project and I know that I will not be able to devote the time I need to it with interruptions every minute or so, so I tell her that she needs to contact my non-supervisor, Rita (not her real name) to see if it's okay.  Then, I tell Rita, before Betsy makes the call, the situation.  I tell her that I don't think it's appropriate for me to do work for other departments while I'm working the switchboard, unless it's something that doesn't involve many brain cells, like, stuffing envelopes.  I also reiterate that I do not mind doing forms, letters, etc. for  them  because, after all, they are in my department and the projects are never very complicated.  Rita says she'll handle it.    Later, I tell Rita that this request upset me because a) I don't work for Betsy, but if I am going to do work for Betsy, I should get paid for it above and beyond what I usually do, and b) I could come in at another time and do it for her much easier and I believed the reason Betsy asked me to do this project while working on the switchboard was to get me to do extra work without paying me for it.  (Granted, that may not have been the case, but that's what it seemed like).  Besides, In Betsy's department, if someone from another department asked one of her employees to do something for their department... well, it's such a hassle, they usually don't get to do it and people have stopped asking.  I figure that's another point in my defense.  Rita appears to be ready to back me up on this and says not to worry about it.  After lunch, Rita asks me to look at the form that needs "tweaking."  I could feel the knife prick me in the back.  The form has been made on Adobe, a program I am not that familiar with, by someone else in the building.  I tell Rita that I thought this issue was settled, and then she said, "well, I think you could do it.  She's faxing the changes down to me now."   I felt like I was going to pass out.  I loudly proclaimed that if she made me do this project, I was going to charge Betsy's department for my time and stomped back out to the switchboard.  (For this, another employee who gets taken advantage of in that department was screaming inside her head, "You go girl!")  One of Betsy's employees (who is also one of my closest friends) calls me (she left early) and asks how my afternoon is going.  I tell her about Betsy's request.  She is flabbergasted.  "She asked me to do it and I told her that I couldn't do it because we don't have the Adobe program.  I can't get her to understand the difference between Adobe, the program, and Acrobat Reader.  You don't have that program, either.  The only person who does is the person who created the form.  Why is she asking you to do this?"       * translation:    Not only has Betsy (whom you don't work for) asked you to tweak a form... because you don't have the right program, you'll have to start over from scratch... and by the way, this isn't your job.   About the time I am feeling really steamed, Rita comes and tells me that the person who originated the form is going to take care of it, so I  won't have to do it after all .  She smiles.  "Doesn't that make your day?"  I took a deep breath and informed Rita my day should not have had to have been made at all.  She smirked and said, "I think that the real reason you didn't want to do it is because you have a problem with Betsy."  HUH?!  (Without getting into 8 years worth of previous political garbage at this job, Betsy has long believed I have had a problem with her and I have no idea why, and she's even told new employees to stay away from me because I am a troublemaker).   I had never mentioned anything about this to Rita which leads me to believe that Betsy has said something to that effect when she was told I was upset about her request.  As calmly as I could I explained the following to Rita:      * I have no problem with Betsy (I never have, I didn't start it, I have no idea what the deal is).  I would have a problem with  any  supervisor bringing me a time consuming project to do because they assume I have the time because they think I don't do anything.      * I told Rita about Betsy's comments about me not being busy today and having time to help her out (see translation).      * I do not feel respected by Betsy and I definitely didn't feel respected by Rita because she should have stood up for me, told Betsy no, or at the very least told Betsy that she should call me on a day when I was not working to work on this project.      * I felt that if I said yes this time, the floodgates would open because I didn't draw the boundary and stick to it.  My job description does not say, "misc. duties as needed for the ENTIRE company," and I didn't want to expand it to that.      * That I resent that I get paid the same amount as the other person who holds my position, yet I am continually called on to do other work that the other person does not have to do simply because she does not have the skills.  (and do I get paid more? NO)      * I said that I resented the fact that she expected me to do this extra project without extra compensation and that because I stood up for myself, Betsy was mad at me.  Rita didn't say a word.  Meanwhile, the phone kept ringing, reinforcing my point about interruptions while trying to do a lengthy project that requires thought and concentration.  After I told her that it really upset me that she didn't respect me, she  walked away from me .   I felt so betrayed.  In her eyes, I should have just said yes and done it, regardless of how long it took me, how difficult it was, or whether or not it was actually my job.  (Let's not forget I didn't have the program to do complete the job quickly and easily).    If I could have quit this afternoon, I would have.  I am so sick of being disrespected.  I am barely holding it together financially, and walking out would not have been practical... but I wanted to quit so badly.    Now, I am back on the Black Sheep list at my job, and I have worked hard over the last 4 years to undo whatever it is that people like Betsy think that I've done.  I just couldn't help myself.  I had to draw the line and stick by it.  I had to stand up for myself, and I'm glad that I did it.  I know that Rita will act as if nothing happened on Monday.  I know that Betsy will glare at me again and others will too... again.  Though I feel as if that's all worth the trade off of knowing I stood my ground, it will also make things more difficult if I'm not careful.  I also know that the possible job offer in another dept where I work is probably down the tubes now, too.  This person was going to help me get on at the company full time by filling in the days I wasn't working, but she had to be talked into it by another good friend that has worked for her, because, this possible employer has heard a great deal about my previous Black Sheep days.   Of course, I had been praying that God would make it clear whether I was to take this position or not, because I had an uneasy feeling in my gut when she offered it to me.  It would have been a bandaid for me, but not a solution, or best option.  I appreciated the offer, but my first instinct wasn't, "I should definitely do this."    Then Jene' confessed that she also prayed God would make it absolutely clear whether or not I should take this job.  Therefore, I blame what happened today on Jene'.  (HA HA)  She made up for it by giving me some Hershey's dark chocolate kisses, and I'm glad I have confirmation that I need to find a job at a place where I can be respected.  Yes, this was the straw that broke this camel's back.  If this had been an isolated incident, I probably wouldn't have reacted like I did.  I haven't felt respected at that job in a long time, and this incident just broke the dam.    Would it have been easier just to shut up and do the work and not complain?  Maybe... but I'd feel worse about myself right now and I'd feel much more stressed because I let myself be a doormat...again.  I also have to prepare myself for the fallout, if there is any, and I have to let people think what they will and know that the people who love me and really know me will know the truth about me.  That's what really matters to me.  It wasn't easy standing up for myself, and maybe I could have handled it more "professionally," but I'm glad I did it.  It was an important, long overdue step on the road to respect.

       THE POSTCARD OF REJECTION   With the two members of this household both seeking employment, the rejection letters and phone calls are piling up... not to mention the countless possible employers we  never  even hear back from.  My roommate, however, recently received the most impersonal job-seeking rejection I've ever seen.    The wording of the rejection was fairly standard -- basically, "we aren't interested in you, your gifts, talents or work history at this time."  The parts that seemed totally impersonal were:  a) it was a POSTCARD and not a letter ( thus you don't even warrant a piece of paper and an envelope ) and b) the card didn't even address her personally.  It said:   DEAR APPLICANT:    Dear applicant?   I read that and thought, "at least reject me personally!" as if the rejection would hurt less or mean more because they thought enough to reject me by name.  My roommate, however, thought it was funny and blogged about it herself.  Now, she uses it as a motivational tool with me when I face another rejection.  "Just think of it this way," she says.  "At least you didn't receive the postcard of rejection!"  If I do receive a postcard of rejection, we would then have two and  that  would constitute a collection.  Maybe we can charge an admission fee to see our collection of rejection and that can help us pay our rent.  I'm going to present this idea to my roommate and see what she thinks.  Sadly, I think I may be rejected again.  ;)

       FROM  WARDROBE MALFUNCTION  TO "COSTUME REVEAL"   Janet's apology (as issued on mtv.com today):     One day after Janet Jackson's shocking Super Bowl halftime performance, the singer took responsibility for the breast-baring incident and said she never intended the stunt to go as far as it did.  "The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals," Jackson said in a statement released Monday (February 2). "MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended — including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL."    Sorry, Janet, I don't think that's going to get the FCC off your back.   Costume reveal?  Wardrobe malfunction?   Why doesn't anybody call it what it really was?    Stupid.  Classless.  Stupid.  Selfish.  Stupid.  Thoughtless.  Stupid.  Crass.  Stupid.  Disrespectful.  Stupid.  Sleazy.  Stupid.  Idiotic.  Stupid.    Stupid.

       "WARDROBE MALFUNCTIONS" AND OTHER LAME EXCUSES   Even people who didn't tune in to the Super Bowl  at all  knew what happened by the time I got to work today.  If the whole purpose of the classless stunt pulled by Janet and Justin (J & J) was to get some publicity and get people talking about them, it worked.  Most of what I heard today, even from people I know who are hard to shock, were stunned silent after the halftime show ended last night, and it wasn't just J & J's fault.  The lyrics to every song included sexual references, but because we have become such a visual nation, I think that increased the shock when Janet's sleazy dancers appeared and then the  wardrobe malfunction  happened.    The FCC is now involved  urlLink   and what maybe started as a classless, tasteless stunt is going to cost someone big bucks.  I think it should start with the performers, but given we live in a society where accused (innocent until proven guilty) rapists, murders, abusers and pedophiles --   who just happen to be professional athletes or celebrities   -- roam free (because they have the money from their celebrity) and even continue to play and perform, I doubt much happens to J & J but a momentary public shunning and maybe some embarrassment.   I think Viacom (who owns CBS and MTV) is going to get a huge fine... but that's about it.  When Janet's new CD comes out, will people buy it?  Yes.  As memorable as the  wardrobe malfunction  was, the public's memory is so short, so forgiving, so willing to look the other way, even when a woman's breast is bared in an attempt to shock 100 million people (that included many children).  Besides, it's easier to forget about it because that's what the majority will do... the high road, the right thing, is always tougher and is always represented by the minority.  Morals just aren't cool.  Nipple shields and  wardrobe malfunctions  are.    Janet's new single was  coincidentally  shipped to radio stations this weekend.  Her name was mentioned millions of times today -- more press than she's received in years.  The only way to stop this behavior among celebs is to not buy their product when they act like their brains were sucked out of their heads... but that doesn't happen.  If people stopped buying Madonna and Britney's "music" after their recent stunt, then the next time an opportunity to prove their lack of morals and class presented itself, they might (okay, that's a stretch, I know) think twice.    This will not be the end of Janet's career, or Justin's.  They will rise back to the top faster than you can say Dixie Chicks.

       SOME COMMENTS FROM THE NEWS ABOUT HALFTIME SHOW   Gosh, that was quick.  The denial and outrage has been given by all big wigs involved and the performers are calling it a mistake.   Here are some comments:     CBS and the NFL disavowed a Super Bowl halftime performance Sunday night that concluded with Justin Timberlake baring Janet Jackson's right breast.   The incident was so upsetting to the NFL that it suggested MTV won't be permitted to produce another halftime show.   "We were extremely disappointed by moments of the MTV-produced halftime show," said Joe Browne, NFL executive vice president of communications. "They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the content of the show. It is unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime."   CBS, a sister of MTV (both are owned by Viacom), also appeared to be taken aback by Sunday's show.   "CBS deeply regrets the incident that occurred during the Super Bowl halftime show," a network spokeswoman said. "We attended rehearsals throughout the week, and there was no indication this would happen. It did not conform to CBS broadcast standards, and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended."   Timberlake said he did not intend to tear the cup off Jackson's black leather bustier, exposing a nipple piercing shield.   "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl," Timberlake said in a statement. "It was not intentional and is regrettable."    If it was a wardrobe malfunction, what  was  supposed to happen when he reached over there?

       AND SUPER BOWL 38 IS OVER...   ...but not without its controversy.  First of all, let me say I loved the game.  It was competitive, close and after a sluggish start, well played.  I really didn't care who won either way, (though I always pull for the underdog)  but I was happy to see Adam Viniteri get an opportunity to redeem himself and win the game with a field goal.  The pre-game show was one of the best I'd seen in many years, including the two times they made me cry with the interview of the Columbia crew's families, and the interview of Trent Dilfer (who lost a son recently), Jim Kelly (who has a terminally ill son) and Boomer Esiason (who has a son with a serious life threatening illness).  After all that, however, I was looking forward to some good music.  I will always love Aerosmith, no matter how old they get, and Toby & Willie did a fine job as well.  The tribute to the lost crew of the Columbia made me cry.  Josh Groban did such an excellent job with that song, he tore me up.  Then Beyonce', very conservatively dressed, stepped up and let her voice be the center of attention as she belted out the National Anthem.  That was my favorite part of the non-sports activities.  As for the half time show...  I was so disappointed.   The pre-game show was better, and well, cleaner and safer for children to watch.  First of all, CBS should  never  hire MTV to do the halftime show ever again.  Second, how many years ago was it that Janet Jackson put out an album?  Her voice was pre-recorded and synthesized, and her dancers were dressed like tramps.  I would have much rather watched the U of H and TSU bands do a halftime show than watch her (though "Rythym Nation" is one of my favorite songs of hers) gyrate with her dancers and Justin Timberlake.  I do like Kid Rock and to say his performance was the best and cleanest part of the show speaks volumes.  I do not dislike Nelly or P Diddy but their performance was lackluster and uninspired.  I kept waiting for the "good part," and it really never arrived.  To make it worse, the show ended on a XXX note.  As he sang the lyric, "I'll have you naked by the end of this song," Justin Timberlake reached over and tastelessly ripped off the coverings of one of Janet's breasts.  I sat there, thinking, "that had to have been a mistake or an accident," but Janet had promised that her show would feature a surprise guest, and apparently, her "guest" was her exposed breast, and her lack of class.  The picture in the newspaper clearly shows that her breast was completely covered by a skin toned cloth, but she was counting on the cameras being far enough away to not be able to tell the difference and she was correct.  The move was even more classless than Madonna kissing Britney, and I thought after that all time low stunt, the networks (especially CBS, who seems to be censoring everything lately) would ensure that a family event like the Super Bowl would be free of such stunts.  In fact, CBS Sportsline is currently running a poll for the most memorable moment of the Super Bowl and it lists Janet's "wardrobe malfunction," as one of the moments to choose from?  How can something planned be a malfunction?  I do not envy the NFL commissioner's office e-mail box, which should be full by now, or the e-mail box at Viacom (which owns CBS and MTV).  Please help me by filling them up.  Let them know that this lack of respect for their viewing audience will not be tolerated.  And the ads?  Where were the ads?  I saw too many repeats of old ads or ads that debuted in the pre-game slots.  I liked the NFL's "Tomorrow," and the donkey who wanted to be a Budweiser clydesdale.  I kept waiting for the ad that would make me say, "now that was worth the 2 million dollars spent for the 30 seconds," but I was disappointed again.  The sad thing is, people will associate these shortcomings with Houston in general and that shouldn't happen.  I really hope that the Super Bowl comes back and all that is tied into it (including the ads and shows) will make people say, "wow!" instead of, "Oh, no!"  CBS still owes me an apology for the halftime show.

       MORE CELEB INSANITY   This is the funniest one yet.  Last night, during the Super Bowl update on Channel 11, there was a "Celeb Sighting Ticker" running across the bottom of the screen.  They listed everybody -- from the people who were obvious because they are performing in the pre-game or halftime show (Janet Jackston, Aerosmith, P Diddy), to "celebs" who are just in town for the game.    The funniest one?   Gary Berghoff .  Yes, Gary Berghoff.  Remember Radar on M*A*S*H?  Has he really done  anything  since then?  lol... but he's been sighted in and around Houston.  I'm telling you, the town has gone crazy.  The Super Bowl kicks off in four and a half hours, then tomorrow, things should return to somewhat normal...

       ANOTHER BLONDE/CLUMSY MOMENT   This scenario may be tough to visualize, but Thursday I was transferring last year's financial files out of my co-worker's office to make room for this year's files (fiscal year is April - March).  Last year's files are housed in a filing cabinet across the lobby of our suite.  Not a vast distance, but the trip is tedious when you have to carry four (actually 4 1/2 crammed into 4) large file drawer's worth of files across the room.   I was already tired (after unloading the 2002-03 files into banker boxes to be hauled away along with 10,000 copies of purchase orders) when I got a  brilliant beyond brilliant  idea.  The roommate is always telling me I need to  think lazy ... meaning finding the easiest way to do something difficult... so I thought I'd found a lazy, convenient way to move the files.  From personal experience, I should know that ideas I get when physically tired aren't always thought out as well as they should be.  Keep that in mind.  Ahem... try to picture this.  In my co-worker's office she has a two-tub filing system that hangs in a plastic frame with wheels.  I store the alpha numeric cardboard filing systems I use to help with sorting, a pen and that fingertip sticky stuff I use to help me with gripping the papers.  That's it.  My co-worker uses the top of the filing system as extra desk space when she's got one too many files for her desk.  I was thinking about how I could make life easier for myself when I spied the two-tub deal in the corner.  I thought, "hey, this has wheels!" so I stuffed the tubs full and started to wheel it across the suite.   Who'd have guessed that these plastic things can't hold that much weight? (ha ha) Five feet from my intended destination, the unit groaned and wobbled, then the brackets snapped in half.   The tubs were stuffed so full that when they bounced and tipped over on the floor, not one file or piece of paper fell out.    I cracked up while the lady in the desk behind me tried to keep her laughter to herself.  I told her it was okay to laugh... I realized that it was a stupid plan to begin with, but I was so tired, I just had to try it!  We laughed, which drew attention from my co-worker's office and she started laughing when I showed her the pieces of the broken apparatus.     So much for being lazy, right? One of the maintenance guys thinks he can glue it back together and it may hold the 5 pounds of stuff I usually keep in it.   He took it away and it hasn't been returned yet.  Too funny... then the lady who witnessed my clumsy/blonde moment broke her letter opener about an hour later and she couldn't fix the heavy duty stapler (which someone had put staples that were too big in it), so I didn't feel so bad...until my co-workers started to call me, "Destructo."  All further  brilliant beyond brilliant  ideas I get when physically tired will be filtered through the roommate who is lazier and much more clever than I am... until which time I prove that my ideas are not destructive.  Trust me, it's much safer for office furniture everywhere.

       MORE TALES FROM THE RECEPTIONIST   I cannot say what her real name is, so I'll call her Sadie.  Sadie calls the switchboard periodically -- in fact for a while she called us once a week to tell us some wild story.  She's been banned from the church because she used to charge the pulpit during sermons, screaming and calling the pastor names.  We're not really sure how she gets use of a phone (she's not supposed to have one where she lives), but occasionally she rings us to liven up our day.   The last time I heard from her, she told me that virgins have supernatural power (and nobody told me!) and that she was afraid she was going to kill the drunk man who comes to visit her the next time he came over... because she has this supernatural power and he doesn't know it.  Ok...   Last week she called and said, "The pastor said Sunday that smoking in the house of God is evil," and she wanted to come arrest the person smoking in the house of God.  I told her that I was fairly certain that nobody had been smoking in the building (except for my smoking popcorn incident), and she laughed and said, "oh this was  years  ago, but I want to arrest him for smoking in the house of God."     Then she says that she wants to put on a police uniform and arrest whoever it is she thinks is smoking in the church...and if we would please hire her as a security guard she'd be happy to do the job.     "Please keep me in mind," she says.   Oh yeah, I will.   I go home and tell my roommie about Sadie's latest call and she says, "that's odd, there was an episode of  The West Wing  last week where the president smoked a cigarette in a church and it caused a big ruckus."  If Sadie is indeed watching  The West Wing , then the man she wants to arrest is Martin Sheen.    I've watched the last few episodes of  The West Wing , just in case she calls again.  Any advantage or small clue I can have in these conversations is helpful.    And how is life in your world?

       "SHARON, I THINK THERE'S A FROG IN OUR KITCHEN."   That's how my roommie greeted me around 11 o'clock this morning.  We had a small monsoon that started around 10:30 and usually, a sustained downpour like that makes a nice puddle in our kitchen beneath the window, but does not usually bring friends into the kitchen.   My head is pounding this morning, as it is raining and also spring in Southeast Texas.  This means everything outdoors is coated with a light yellow powder (pollen) and allergy sufferers like me are miserable.  This is one of the reasons why, at 10:30, I was still in bed when the rain started.    After the frog announcement, I fumble around for my glasses so that I can accurately verify if there's a frog in our kitchen.  I am asked to go downstairs as the backup in the Frog Relocation Program.  Jene' says Q-bert (this is the name chosen for the frog) is her friend, meaning, that Q-bert will eat mosquitoes outside of our apartment, and therefore, deserves to live.  I agree and once downstairs, I verify that indeed, we have a frog on our window sill.    Q-bert looks as if he just lost his tadpole tail this week.  He is that froggy brownish green color and looks to be about an inch and a half long.  Q-bert appears to be not a tadpole, not yet a frog (sorry for the Britney reference).  He looks up at us as if to say, "there's just too much water out there, can I stay in here with you?" but Jene' has already grabbed an empty small butter plastic butter dish (or was it a lemon chill cup?) and a paper towel and slowly eases Q-bert into it.  She releases him outside and eventually (we know because we checked) he hops away.  Yes, that was the excitement of our morning.  We have both taken applicable meds and are feeling much better... well, I am, but Jene' is still a little dizzy.  This means I will drive to the movie later and then we'll stop by Sam's to restock on goodies since I am working every day this month and have a slight surplus of cash (which will allow for necessities like toilet paper).    Roommie has now blogged about Q-bert as well.  Need to go check that out!

       I'M BACK!!   Our DSL is now SUPER FAST... so much better than dial-up.  While "offline" I read a couple thousand pages of the Harry Potter series and I started a new book called,  Girl Finds God , by Lauren F. Winner.  I will blog more about that book as soon as I finish it.  So far, it's been a great read.    Thought to Ponder:    On the way home, I meandered through back streets to avoid long waits at traffic lights... and though it may be a slightly longer route to get home, at least I am in motion the whole time, and therefore, the journey itself doesn't  seem  to take as long.   I laughed as I realized I do this, then thought, "Why can't I seem to do that in other areas of my life?  Why can't I stay in motion?"  A thing to make you say, "hmm..."  Jene' is off to Republican headquarters to watch the election results trickle in for today's primary.  For the first time in my life I got to vote for someone I know and not only that, I know he's the best man for the job (it's so rare to be able to depart from  the lesser of two evils  voting).  He is also an ornery man (it's always the quiet ones) who likes to grab people's feet during scary orc sections of  Lord of the Rings .  Anyway,  I will update you on Victor's progress for his re-election bid for Railroad Commissioner of Texas.  Jene' had planned to be in Austin with Victor & family to watch the election results, but she had a job interview today (HOORAY) and couldn't make it out of town.  As for me, I got turned down for another position at another church, but they sent me a nice rejection  letter , and it was personalized and did not say, "Dear Applicant."  I am working, however, every day this month, which will produce two healthy paychecks in a row.  WOO HOO!  I can't tell you the last time that happened... well, yes I can... this time last year.   Other interesting tidbits since I blogged last:   - I cooked meat this evening and I do not smell like the meat I cooked.  Bonus.  (last week I had to shower after the  Great Bacon Incident II )  - I had a craving last week for Maneschewitz matza bread, though I'm not Jewish and matza is not a regular part of my diet.  I'm a different combination of "ish."  Amish... Scotish... Irish... and other "ishes."  Not sure what that means, but I will probably pick up a box the next time I pass the kosher section at  Kroger's .  - I learned the cash register system at the bookstore (where I've picked up the extra days) in about 10 minutes and even though the little scanner/barcode reader thingy didn't work most of the time, I did quite well.  Kudos to me.  I guess all that playing with my toy cash register when I was little paid off.  - I have not yet seen Mel Gibson's  The Passion of the Christ .  It's not that I don't want to, but I wanted to wait another week or two so I can go to the theater and weep -- and not in front of 400 people.  It's still tough to get a ticket to this movie in Houston.  From what I've read and from the reactions of people I know, Christian and non-Christian, this is a worthwhile movie on which to spend your money.  - Sunday, I went to Mickey D's to try to win a million dollars, but alas, I wasn't the chosen one for their contest.  Sad, but true.    - I finally received my Hershey's T-shirt (the one I won January 1st - the good omen T-shirt).  It's a long-sleeved, white T-shirt, with a Hershey bar on the front.  Underneath the Hershey bar, it says, "Sharing is Overrated."  Now that I've received the shirt, let the good omens turn into good results!  That's all I can think of right now... I'll most likely blog again soon.  Did you miss me?

       MORE CROWN NEWS AND OTHER STORIES FROM THE REALLY BAD DAY   What a day...  First of all, my temporary crown has been bugging me... so I've had trouble sleeping because of the pain.  Therefore, last night I got about two hour's worth of sleep.  When I woke up this morning, I was really groggy, but I made it to work okay.  Thursday is my day to file and find a place to work wherever I can.   Usually, I use the conference room across the hall and carry my 2' stack of filing across the hall along with my "office in a box" -- a filing box that has pens, paper, sorting stuff, etc.   I get everything sorted into the starting piles and WHAM!  I spilled my coffee all over the conference room table.  I splattered only one piece of paper, but otherwise, made a big mess. Fortunately, I stopped the puddle from leaking onto the floor or the chairs (my biggest concerns).  One of the angels from housekeeping helped me mop up.   So, new cup of coffee in hand, I settle in to file. At 10, I went upstairs to distribute the mail and when I came back... my piles were gone. Turns out the lady who schedules the rooms forgot I was in there and told another group they could use it.    Of course, I was frustrated.  #1, all the piles I made were picked up haphazardly by a stranger who didn't bother to ask if it was okay to move any of it--I mean, whenever I go in to use another office, I always ask if it's okay to move things and believe me when I say I use half of this conference table -- so it's quite obvious that the room was being used.   #2, I  always  use that room as an office unless something else has been scheduled in that room and as of 8 a.m. nothing had been.    I don't blame the scheduling lady.  I just didn't think you could schedule  office space  (nobody else does), so that's why I never did and in over a year, this is the first time something like this has happened.  It's just always worked out that if that room was scheduled, one of the other ladies was out and I used her desk.   So, to ensure this doesn't happen again, I am going to schedule the room as my office from now on for Thursday so there will be no further conflicts... and everything worked out today because  one of the ladies was leaving for a meeting, so I took over her office until 2.   Still, it was a huge disruption after a bad start to my morning.  Oh, and if it just ended there...I would have been in a great mood... but it didn't...   I called a dentist recommended to me (cost wise/payment plan) for a root canal (my dentist doesn't do them).  $765...  though I could possibly pay it out over 12 months.  No problem, right? Well, considering I've only had full time hours for 6 weeks after nearly a year of barely making ends meet... and I'm now having to go back make up for a bunch of stuff and my salary really isn't competitive, it's not like I'm "liquid" you know?    AND...  Because I don't have benefits yet, I still have to budget for those holidays/days off I don't get paid for and for the time off I have to take to go to the dentist for the other issues.  I'm already paying payments to my initial dentist, so I'm all paymented out at this point.   UGH.   So, of course, being all emotional at this time of the month... and being extremely tired, I sat in there and cried for a while.  I had to let off some steam, you know?  Not only was I tired... I was frustrated, and my tooth was bugging me.  My benefits/full time status was still in limbo and I wasn't sure how long I was going to be able to hold onto this tooth without a root canal.      Finally, I got a grip, pulled it together and kept working. Then, during lunch, as I'm telling my peeps how my day has been going, one of my friends says, "hey, at least it's not raining!"...and then... (drumroll please)   MY TEMPORARY CROWN FALLS OFF!!   Everything touching my tooth, air, cold water, etc. nearly made me cry. I get an appointment at 4 so I don't miss too much work.   One of my co-workers finds an empty ziploc bag in the bookstore to put the crown in and I go back to work.   The pain gets progressively worse.   I used to have an enviable pain tolerance, but pain definitely bothers me more, much more than it used to, but I suck it up and keep working ... filing... trying not to inhale through my mouth.  I finally used the pain as a motivator and I got an audience with the director of personnel and ask her where they're at with getting me benefits. She says that since I work for three depts, all three parties have to commit to saying they want me long term. One party is on board, the other dept head keeps thinking it's taken care of but apparently it wasn't and then the personnel director says if I can get her on board, she'll take care of the third person involved.   I leave her office, call party #2 and leave her a message... and find out later, she took care of it. Whew... so I don't know when I'll get benefits, but we're one step closer.   As I drive out to the dentist in my car with no a/c (it was very warm and humid today), I'm more than uncomfortable. I take ibuprofen once I get to the dentist. I hand her my temporary crown and she smiles and says, "the cement will be cold."   Well, I closed my eyes and went to my happy place.  I nearly ripped the arms of the chair off, but it wasn't worth getting a shot, because I would have had to wait a long time and the shots don't work on me like they do for "normal" people. So I grip the chair and suck it up.  It actually wasn't so bad... meaning the chair is still in tact.   I ate very soft food for dinner and right now, there is slight pain, much like when I first came home with this crown last week.   Never fear.   In an hour or so I'm taking two MIDOL (yes, it's been a GREAT day) and then, I'm going to bed.   Tomorrow will be better. Tomorrow will be better...

       FOOD POISONING REALLY BITES   You know, I know better than to eat salad that a) I didn't prepare myself or b) isn't kept cold at all times.  Bad Shae.  Bad.    MORE TALES FROM THE RECEPTIONIST   Friday... ah yes, Friday... well, since it was Friday, I don't know why I was surprised when they showed up at my desk.  The especially  odd  and  dangerous  walk-ins always find their way to my desk on Fridays.   I'll call my most recent walk-ins Fred and George.    Fred, a recent prison parolee (he showed me his card), comes in and leans on my desk.  George has already made himself comfy on the couch and uses the phone while Fred tries to tell me his "story."  I don't say that to be cold or uncaring, I just wish people didn't think that they need an elaborate story to get help.  In fact, the more elaborate the story, the less credibility they sometimes have.  If help is really needed, first, ask for help and keep the explanation very short...like, "I need help with rent," and leave it at that.  I'm less apt to believe a person who feels it necessary to stand there and tell me some story that is totally improbable and gets more unbelieveable as the layers of the story are added.    For example (taken from real conversations I've had), after the second or third time they've been on disability while their husband's been laid off after after 10 strokes, 5 various organ transplants (in the same person, including the appendix)  and/or numerous prescriptions needed for their  fibleroid catatonial leuchosis  (a combination of all the false diseases some of these people have told me they're besieged with), well, let's just say where I work you do not get extra points or money for "creativity."    Granted, there are many people who come in who genuinely need help.  They tell me that they need help, I point them in the direction of our benevolence office which is well equipped to help, and they get help without needing their 5 various organ transplants story.  Those people can come see me any time.  Back to Fred.  Fred is telling me his story (which was nowhere close to making sense) and the phone was ringing off the hook, so I stopped him and asked him, "what do you  need ?"  He wanted money, of course. To protect me and the other people in the building, we are not allowed to give out money and we have a place offsite for benevolence (it's with the food pantry and clothes closet). I explained to Fred this fact several times, but he didn't seem to get it.  The more I said, "no one in this building is going to give you money," the more he disconnected from what I was saying.    I consider myself very intuitive.  At this point, I should have called security, but I was distracted -- so distracted that 3 callers in a row received wrong service time information, etc.  Why was I distracted?  The more disconnected Fred became, the more he stuck his finger up his nose and wiped his findings on the counter of my desk.  (Jene' says that the display of bodily fluids in public is a sign of a deranged person).  I explained to Fred again that NO ONE in the building was going to give them money, but I could send them down to the cafeteria to get a sandwich.  George hopped up off the couch and agreed.  They left and I immediately pulled out a clorox swipe and went to work on the counter, totally forgetting to call security at that point.  Jene' said my intuition was screaming at me at this point and I didn't listen.  She was right.  Boogeys distracted me from my intuition.  UGH  Well, Fred & George never made it down to the cafeteria. Eventually Officer W had to escort him and his friend out of the building because they were panhandling in the church. W said that they asked every single person they came in contact with for money.  Officer W sent them out to the bus stop, and he kept an eye on them, because  he  was listening to his intuition.   He saw George expose himself to 2 women at the bus stop (using the trash can as a latrine -- more bodily fluids in public).     Officer W sprang into action.  He called for backup and they chased down the bus Fred & George got on and W was so excited -- "It was like cops!!" he told me.  He got to make the arrest.  I know all this because he came back to let me know those two would not be coming back... and after one of the angels from housekeeping disinfected my desk, I felt even better.  It was a bizzare day.   Even more bizarre to realize I could be distracted from my screaming intuition over some boogeys...

       MY FIRST CROWN   OW!!! Well, not enough of an OW to take any major meds, but this very sensitive tooth beneath this temporary crown is driving me NUTS.  This morning, I had to be at the dentist at 7:30.  AM...just after sunrise.  You know, the time when all the vampires are hopping back in their coffins!  Anyway, I got my temporary crown and we are still watching the other two teeth that need root canals (I'm shopping around for cheap root canals) while we play roulette with whether or not I'll be able to tolerate the pain (though slight, every day it gets more interesting) until I can get insurance.  I go back in mid May to get the permanent crown.  This being my first crown, I did not anticipate the annoying sensitivity to cold, hot, pressure, inhaling air across the tooth... basically any activity in my mouth at all (had soft spaghetti for dinner).  Ibuprofen is my friend and I can take more soon, and I still have some teething gel left.  I should be able to sleep.  Oh, but the most fun part was after I left the dentist's office.  You see, there's this kolache shop next door.  I stopped to get a cup of coffee and a ham & cheese kolache.  I am not blonde enough to actually try to drink the coffee while my face is numb.  What the dentist is learning about me is that my mouth and face gets the most numb long after I leave his office.  It's a curse I have -- high tolerance for meds.  They take longer and usually a higher dose to get the desired effect most normal people experience...but I digress.  I put the coffee in the cup holder...I knew it would cool sufficiently as I drove and I wasn't going to try to drink it while cruising down I-10.  The kolache... well, I was hungry!  I didn't eat breakfast (sometimes I have tummy issues when someone drills at such a high pitch) and my blood sugar was low.  So I bit into my kolache and chewed on the side beaing my broken, in need of a root canal, tooth.    Well, the ham in this kolache is in little pellets...and I'm a mile or so down the highway when I realize my, uh,  breastial shelf  is covered in little ham pellets.  Thank God I wasn't trying to drink the coffee, huh? lol  All morning, it was as if my brain was also numb.  I could hardly function while I was numb... and let me tell you, the height of numbness didn't come until 10 a.m.  After that, my brain functions began to improve, but then I started to feel the annoying pain.  I say annoying because my pain threshhold is pretty high and this hurts, but I can live with it.    It's nothing like my episode from last year... see archives  urlLink Shae's trip to the dentist  so I'm pretty happy all things considered...

       ADVENTURES IN A HOUSTON EMERGENCY ROOM   Don't worry, I'm fine.  I merely  accompanied  the injured this time.    My friend E has a 14 year old daughter, C (names changed to protect the clumsy).  C tripped on her way to greet the pizza delivery man... unaided, in her living room.  The ripping sound she heard, I'm sure, was scary enough, but when the pain hit her, E knew the injury was pretty serious by C's reaction.  E called the pediatrician and she told E to take C to get X-rays.    If you live in a small town and have made multiple trips to the emergency room that turned out to be short, easy visits that you complained about nonetheless, you must come hang out in the ER in Houston.  You'll never complain again.  Fortunately, E did not take C to BT Hosp. where, I'm told, if you're not bleeding, carrying the plague or have bones sticking out where they shouldn't, you wait...and wait... because most severe accident victims go to BTH.  The same can be said for the well known children's hospital.  E instead chose the southwest branch of one of the hospital networks in town.   Here is where our adventure begins .  At  7:45 PM  the pizza delivery guy shows up and knocks on E & C's door.  E is lying down, as she had THREE TEETH pulled earlier that afternoon and that can take the wind out of a person's sails for sure, so C jumps up off the couch and charges toward the door.  Unfortunately for C, the instructions carried along her nervous system were interrupted by her teenage awkward stage, and she came down hard on her ankle at a skewed angle.  I, too, have done this, but I cannot blame my teenage awkward stage.  I did something similar 18 months ago...but I digress.  The ripping noise of the awkwardly skewed angled ankle was followed by pain and a flood of tears and a call to the pediatrician.  My phone rang at  8:15 .  E was calm, but asked if I could come help out since a) she had THREE TEETH pulled earlier that afternoon, and b) she'd yet to take any pain killers and was sure the pain would hit her eventually, and c) she'd visited an ER in Houston before and company always helps.  I was halfway through  Pirates of the Caribbean  when the phone rang.  I was in my jammies, curled up with a glass of milk, an Oreo, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and I was totally vegged.  E calmly tells me what happened and asks for my help.  "Of course I'll help," I tell her and  I went from vegetable to super hero with one twirl in the telephone booth ... okay, not really, but in spirit, I do wear the super hero cape. Truthfully, it took me longer than 30 seconds to get dressed, finish my milk, find my cell phone and say goodbye to Johnny and Orlando.     8:40 PM  (yes, it took me 13 minutes to go from vegetable to super hero -- but this is really good for me during a non life threatening emergency -- and 7 minutes to get to E & C's) I walk into the apartment and C has carefully put her shoes on and is ready to go. I observe her injury (the cape gives me great medical wisdom -- I wish) and let C know that if she was a cow, I'd have to shoot her, but since she is not bovine in any way shape, or form, I assure her she'll live.  She grabs Tig and Bub (a stuffed tiger and penguin) for moral support.  She decides that rather than lean on me, she'd rather hop on the good foot and take her chances.  I did not take offence because well, I'm a recovering clumsaholic and if she was leaning on me and my knee or ankle gave out... well, E would be transporting two people one, a victim of her teenage awkward phase, and the other, a woman stuck in her teenage awkward phase.   9:05 PM    I follow behind C as she hops to the sign in desk at the ER while E parks the van.  C leans against the wall while I grab the sign in sheet on the receptionist's desk and look around for a place for C to sit down.  Of course, this is the ER in Houston.  Not a seat or wheelchair to be found.  A very impatient security guard tells me C cannot lean against the receptionist's station.  I told him that there was no place to sit down and he didn't seem impressed.  After a long, deep breath I told him that C needed a wheelchair and told him she'd badly sprained her ankle.  Fortunately for Mr. Impatient Security Guard, his attitude changed and he returned with the necessary equipment, and I moved C out of the way.  I wasn't sure what the cape would make me do if he'd been less than nice.  As we waited for E, I started to fill out the sign in form while C took in what was going on around her.  Not only was the waiting room full, the hallway included about 10 people, including us.  I filled out what I could on the form, then handed it to C, who continued with her SSN, address, etc.  I reminded her she was single, she didn't have a maiden name and helped her spell  ankle .   For some reason, I found that difficult, but we came to an agreement on  kle .  Then E found us and took over the rest of the form.    Having been warned by the roommate (a nurse, she knows these things) that we were all in for a long night, we went to look for a place to sit down.  A few minutes later, two seats cleared out in the ER waiting room, so E and I wheeled C in and took them.   Note here  that I did  not  run C into anything that would cause her pain while I was driving the chair.  No wheelies were popped, no corners taken on one wheel.  Remember, I am wearing my super hero cape and am suddenly responsible.    The waiting room at the ER is full of people who are too sick or injured not to be there, but not sick or injured enough to be whisked away quickly.  Several children were in the room, along with a parent or two each, but sadly, I noticed at least two people who were by themselves, trying to stay awake and alert until their names were called.  Most people in the ER were somber and serious, and I could feel the tension in the room, so what do I do?  I try to make the injured teenager and her mother (did I mention she had THREE TEETH pulled just hours earlier?) laugh.  I love E's laugh.   9:55 PM  C's name is called, and she and E disappear into the ER.   10:05 PM  E comes out to tell me C is on her way to what the hospital refers to as "Fast Track."  We follow C and a nurse (whose legs are programmed for the hospital autobahn) down the hallway to another waiting room... where we see others who were liberated from the ER waiting room... and we... wait.   10:40 PM   Still waiting in "Fast Track" ... E mentions she's thirsty and C says she is as well.  After a minute or two, E mentions her thirst again.  Eventually, her words reach the earphone attatched to my super hero cape and then the words reach my brain and I realize that  I  should go find a vending machine.  Another ER employee (whose legs were also programmed for the hospital autobahn) pointed out the machine and I got us 3 Sprites and a bag of Doritos for me (if I don't eat I turn even more "blonde" than I already am, and since I am  wearing the cape and am responsible , I decide eating now and staying lucid would be a good thing).    I return and a lady sporting blonde dred like tendrils steps out and calls out a name for the consultation and payment portion of the evening. She asks for a lady named, "Albino."  Albino is not present.  We wait some more.   10:50 PM    A bathroom break for E & C while I wait to make sure C's name isn't called while they're gone.   10:55 PM  The lady wishing to know the whereabouts of Albino appears again and totally butchers C's name, but we recognize that C is the one she wants.  E & C go to a room marked,  Patient Access Services  (PAS) and C appears about 10 minutes later, obviously bored with the whole PAS consultation and payment portion of the process.   11:22 PM   E returns from PAS.  They have everything settled and told her that C's chart has been pulled and she'll be with a doctor soon.  Soon in "Fast Track" is like a caution lap at Daytona.  Time should be fast, but it's in slow motion instead.     11:33 PM   C is whisked off to another room, followed by E.  I stick around in "Fast Track" (only one visitor per patient allowed behind the big doors) and watch as supposedly ill children tear apart the "Fast Track" waiting room with more energy and vigor than most sick children.   (Before I pass judgment, I hope that whatever was wrong with these kids is minor...and I also realize at this point that these kids probably didn't have a primary care physician and this was probably a rare time when they actually saw a doctor).    Kids of various ages buzzed about the room, but one little one, a boy about 18 months old I'll call EJ, had eaten several lollipops, a bag of Doritos, a Dr. Pepper and other assorted candy while he waited to see the doctor.  No wonder he stood on the couch and screamed, "MORE CHIPS!" at the top of his little lungs.    Enter Sassy Mama, and her two children Diva and Cutie Pie.  Diva is about 10, CP looks to be about 6.  A nice man with cookies with the word, "VOTE" on them came into the room (behind Sassy Mama and CP) and gave a cookie to Diva who had walked around the couch to throw away something.  Diva then made fun of CP for not getting a cookie.  Diva licked her cookie all over to ensure that sharing will not be forced upon her (SM said that they both had sick germs but shouldn't share them) and continues to taunt CP.  Sassy Mama tells Diva that if she doesn't shut up, she'll have to throw her cookie in the trash.  I walk around the corner to go to the bathroom and found the cookie man and asked him if he'd go give CP a cookie and save his sister's life.  He smiles and goes back to "Fast Track."    When I return to "Fast Track," several more people had been taken into see a doctor, but nobody has been able to locate Ms. Albino.  Sassy Mama, Diva and CP, however are still there.  Diva is at one end of the couch crying while CP eats his cookie.  Apparently, Diva just couldn't let things go and her cookie was now in the trash.  CP then decided to pull out a Buzz Lightyear doll (the talking one with lasers that shoot), and he ceased to be CP and turned into Annoying Brat.  Soon, Sassy Mama decided he was annoying too and Buzz Lightyear disappeared just as I was about to rip the only magazine I had found in half in frustration.   12:14 AM   E returns and lets me know that a half hour ago, C saw a doctor and X-rays were ordered.  A light appears at the end of the tunnel.   12:20 AM   C goes to X-ray.  EJ gets to go see the doctor.   12:40 AM  Doctor gives diagnosis to E & C.  Sassy Mama and her children get to see the doctor.  I'm one of three people left in "Fast Track."  Ms. Albino has never appeared.  One man in particular has been in there as long as I have.  He's in a wheelchair, and he's pulled his sweatshirt up over his head and gone to sleep.  A few minutes later, another group of grownups has brought in another boisterous child and I'm no longer inclined to take a nap.   1:12 AM   E comes out, followed by C, who is on crutches and is sporting a temporary cast and a "really cool ice bag,"  and a prescription for some kickin' painkillers.  Lovely parting gifts for those who endured the ER.     1:30 AM   E needs to stop and get gas on the way home.  No problem.  I take the time and interview C about her experience.  Her one quote:  "I'm really tired."  Me, too, C... me, too...  I arrived at home about 1:50 AM and let E & C know I made it home.  I took off my cape and at 2:06 AM my head hit the pillow and it was the last thing I remember until my alarm went off at 6:30 AM... I hope to catch more zzzz's tonight.  Oh, and the moral of the story:  when the pizza man rings the doorbell... rise slowly and take deliberate steps across the room.  THE END

       TODAY IS TIME CHANGE SUNDAY...   Yes, we've "sprung forward," which means, though the clock says 1 p.m. my body thinks it's actually noon.  For some reason, losing an hour is harder than gaining one, but hopefully by mid week, I won't feel so sluggish.  Though this is the ninth time I've done this, it still doesn't feel normal.    This reminds me... I forgot to change the microwave clock...

       APRIL SHOWERS BRING MAY MOLD   ... and other allergies stories.  Ah, yes, spring is definitely in full swing here in southeast Texas.  Each day, our cars are covered in a thick, yellow dusting of pollen, the air is full of pollen as well, and since we didn't have a good, hard freeze this "winter", mold is rampant everywhere and the mosquitos will be thicker than ever.  But I digress...  It is now April.  March Madness is over and I must say that I did so badly at guessing who would advance, that the last team I didn't mess up on (Duke) lost last night, so none of my picks survived.  Sigh.  It's never been this bad!  On a better note, I'm now working 5 days a week at the church I've worked for off/on for several years.  Two of the days pay less than the other three, but any money is better than none, and since I'm working full time hours, I'm hopeful that I'll be eligible for insurance.  I could use the help in the dental dept and it wouldn't hurt to have a complete physical, either.  So, keep that in mind when you're thinking of me.  Also, at the church, after 4 1/2 years, they've called a pastor, a young man who brings great leadership and discernment.  The vote takes place on Easter Sunday, and though I'm sure they'll vote him in, many of the more seasoned crowd isn't sure what they think of this guy yet.  As far as from the view from an employee standpoint, I'm just excited to have a boss again... maybe some things will change, maybe they won't, but at least it's a step in the right direction.  On another note, I think I've finally narrowed down my church searching.  I haven't been visiting different campuses lately, because I wanted to step back and decide which denomination I felt most aligned with.  I also wanted to give myself time to grieve my losses and to seek God to know which way I could best worship.  Please keep that in your prayers as well and I will update more about that soon.

       A WEEK OF BLONDE MOMENTS   If you know me all, you know I embrace my blondeness.  Some examples from this week:  Blonde moment #1 involved orange barrels (think construction nightmares). I will say no more about that.   Blonde moment #2 involved the washing machine. Apparently this random light switch outside the closet that the machine is in is directly connected to the outlet  in  the closet and if you turn it off, the washer won't work. The maintenance people at our complex LOVE us.  I'm sure we were a source of amusement for them.  Blonde moment #3 involved meeting the new pastor's wife at the church where I work. She isn't very tall and when she reached across the desk to shake my hand. I conked her elbow on the shelf. Brilliant.  Blonde moment #4 involved the speaker system in the office suite I work in. I used the remote at the desk I was using to turn up the stereo.  I kept turning it up and up but there was no sound.  So, I thought I had turned it down sufficiently.  I went to the closet where the main console was and noticed the speaker buttons were off. I pushed the speaker button and   NO   I had not turned it down at all! It was at FULL volume!! You've heard the noise... the loudest sound burst imaginable without making you pass out.   Imagine someone taking the heart paddles and shouting, "CLEAR!" and shocking you while you were still alert. That's how the ladies felt out there.  I think I nearly gave one a heart attack.  Brilliant.  Friday, however, I was blonde moment free.  I was grateful to take a blonde day off.    One other note... Memorial Day will be my first paid day off in almost 5 years!  I will truly be able to relax and enjoy myself.    Good night and may the blonde not be near you when her blonde control gauge explodes.

       IT'S OFFICIAL!  I HAVE A FULL TIME JOB...   After five years (nearly to the day) I have benefits again!  I will get paid for holidays off, sick days, vacation days, health & dental benefits...   I was informed today that I'm full time.  I am relieved and happy. Not that the pay is the best or that it's my dream job, but I had to start somewhere.  By no means am I rich, but it's enough if I'm careful.  It's also been great going to the same place every day, and now it's even better because it's permanent.  No more guessing, no more wondering, "what happens if I get sick?"  or, "what if I don't get enough hours this week?"  It will be nice to get a consistent routine going.  I haven't had that in over a year.  I like my three bosses, my co-workers, and the variety of the jobs I do.  It's nice to get a break like this after waiting as long as I have (and I know some have waited longer or are still waiting).    Thanks for all your prayers!  (Now please pray for the roomie to get some full time work as well!)

       THROBBING TEETH AND MY NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH ORAJEL   My teeth are throbbing.  There could be several reasons:  a) My sinuses (I'm so congested) are pressing down on the nerves in my mouth.  This has happened before -- long before my current tooth problems.    b) The tooth that's broken and in need of a root canal has finally gone nuclear.  c) both A & B  d) The temporary crown is covering a tooth that might need a root canal.  e) both A, B, and D.  Really, I have no idea.  All I know is -- chewing is an adventure.  I have invested in a tube of super Orajel that will numb just about anything.  I use it before bedtime so I can sleep.  I don't know what will happen with the teeth issue, so therefore, I'm going to let things run their course and go from there.  I can't worry about it anymore... :)

       MARRIAGE WISDOM FROM PRESCHOOLERS   Tonight my roomie was babysitting three darling little girls, the oldest is almost 5 and the twins are almost 3.  I sometimes go with her to play.  I always have fun and usually, I learn something I never knew before.   For example, tonight, one twin and the four year old decided to help me get ready to get married.  The two year old put a scarf on my head and said, "Now you can get married."  At first, I thought she said, "You can be Mary," thinking we were going to do a Bible story, but I finally realized (after a few repeats) she was saying, "Put this on.  Now you can get  married ."    While the 4 year old put barrettes and a flower wreath in my hair, I asked the little one, "So, what does the preacher say when you get married?" thinking she'd recently been to a wedding and that's why all of a sudden she was talking about marriage.  She looked at me and said, "he says, 'put this on,' and you're married."  Then she put another scarf over my legs and said, "there.  Now you won't ever be cold again."  Meanwhile the four year old said, as she tied a man's necktie around my head, "the preacher says you have to be tied together or it just won't work."    "Really?"  I ask.  "What  else  does the preacher say?"  4 year old:  "He tells you to take your clothes off.  All of them.  Then put on a bathing suit." 2 year old:  (He says)  "Now, let's have lunch!" 4 year old:  "You really do have to take all your clothes off, but then you put on the bathing suit and it's okay." 2 year old (after the scarf falls off):  "You can't get married without this on!"  Who knew that if I would just put a scarf on I could get married?  (ha ha)  I also learned something about the Great Wall of China.  The 4 year old and I watched about 21 minutes of  Mulan  before she went to bed.  In the very beginning there's a scene that shows the Great Wall.  She turns to me and says, "that's the great big wall.  A  great  wall.  It goes up China and down China.  It goes  all over  China."  I wonder if this all means I should honeymoon in China after I put my scarf on and get married?  Lots to ponder...

       urlLink    Ronald Reagan&nbsp; urlLink      GOODBYE, RONALD REAGAN   The death of former President Ronald Reagan has conjured up many memories for me.  Some are of President Reagan, others are of my brother, my grandfather and others.  Reagan was president while I was in junior high and high school, before I could vote. Politics, in my world, was mostly locally focused during my teenage years, but I remember the assassination attempt, the Berlin Wall speech, the speech after the Challenger tragedy and many more.  I remember he was a popular president and I remember he was a classy one as well.   The first memory  that popped into my head that wasn't of Reagan personally was of my older brother.  Scott absolutely  loved  Ronald Reagan.  Remember the show  Family Ties?   The character played by Michael J. Fox -- Alex P. Keaton, who idolized Ronald Reagan -- had a picture of Reagan hanging on his wall, and so did my brother.  He was a total devotee of Reagan and all he stood for.  I know Reagan inspired him to be more than he was, and he often said that Reagan was classy and he wanted to be like that.  Those memories of Scott still make me smile and miss him that much more.     The second memory  was of my grandfather, who like Ronald Reagan, suffered from Alzheimer's for years before he died in May of 1987.  I remember one of the last times I saw him before he went to the nursing home.  During a rare moment of clarity, he spoke my name.  He rarely, if ever called me by name...he had a nickname for me or often went down the list of his daughters before he'd get to my nickname, but at that moment he called me by name and told me he loved me.  At a time when Alzheimer's was still largely misunderstood and everyone around me told me he really wasn't "in there," he looked me in the eye and let me know he was still in there.  I grieved for him in that moment, because he was an intelligent, articulate man trapped by a disease that took away his mind, the ability to enjoy his life as well as the ability to let us all know how much he loved us.  I don't know if Nancy Reagan or the Reagan children had any moments like that with President Reagan over the last ten years.  Something in my gut says that though they said goodbye to the man they knew a long time ago, that there were some moments, some signs that he was still present with them in mind as well as body.  I'm sure those private, wonderful and gut-wrenching moments will be cherished as much as the memory I have of those last shared moments with my grandfather.  I watched a good portion of the state funeral last night and will watch the funeral tomorrow.  My heart is warmed by the outpouring of sympathy from all over the world.  Though I knew Reagan was a popular president, I am still grasping the scope of what he meant, not only to this country, but to the world.  Some of my favorite Reagan Quotes:  "Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born."  "I have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency, even if I'm in a cabinet meeting."  "My fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you I just signed legislation which outlaws Russia forever. The bombing begins in five minutes."  -- Said during a radio microphone test, 1984  "We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them — this morning, as they prepared for their journey, and waved goodbye, and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'" -- Speech about Challenger disaster, Jan. 28, 1986   "The best minds are not in government. If any were, business would hire them away."  "Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first."  "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'"

       LONG TIME, NO POST   How time flies when you're working full time...  Well, I spent Memorial Day, my first paid day off in nearly five years...sick.  Not incapacitated, just a little sinus infection.  I did not want my day off to go to waste, so I spent the day sewing.  I made my first pair of pants ever.  With the help of my sewing consultant, Jene', I now have a nice pair of brushed blue denim capris.   I am a very visual person, however, so there was a fair amount of comedy as I tried to follow the lame pattern pictures.  (I mean, how many times  can  you rip off pockets, sew them on, rip them off, sew them on...) A great deal of the fun involved the inseam.  At one point I was so confused about how the pants should look, we had to pull a pair of pants out of the dryer for visual reference.    They are finished, however, and they do look nice.  One mental note to self... even if the seams are on the inside, when using dark fabric...white thread isn't the best idea.  I'll know better next time.  And the shirt I made looks great, but it's a little too short and will need a ruffle or addition on the bottom so I can raise my arms without exposing anything important.    So, that was my adventure Monday.  How was your long weekend?

      ...twice in one night...   Yes, I'm watching it  again ! It's either  Princess Diaries , or  Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring ,  The Three Musketeers , or the news.    Granted, I can identify with Pippin in LOTR, so I could watch that... but I can't really identify with Athos, Porthos, or Aramis in TTM.  I really identify with the clumsy moments I'm witnessing in PD, so I'm watching that.    Oh, thank you Disney West!!  Now it's on again two times in a row...  I think I need to go to bed.

      I was 3/4 of the way through sewing a shirt and I ran out of thread.  Yes, that's right, you read it here, folks.  I RAN OUT OF THREAD.  I stared at the machine and the nearly empty spool of thread in disbelief...(I was smart enough to leave some on so I could match the thread, then realized at the store there's a color number on the bottom of the spool, but I digress).  The other color of blue thread (close enough to be sisters, really) ran out on me about five minutes later.    So, what's a girl to do?  I mean, after all, I'm sitting there, covered in bits of thread... hair all mussed, but it's 6:00 p.m. and if I wait, I will have to get the thread after church and I wanted to wear this shirt to church... ugh.  I also realized at this point that it's been nearly 6 hours since I ate anything, and we all know how dangerous and stupid it is for me not to eat (thank goodness I ate before I tried to sew on the sleeves!  Sleeves and I are still enemies).  At the very least, I could get to the fabric store and forget why I'm there, not buy the thread, and end up back at home very confused and mad.  Hmm...  I stupidly choose thread over food.  It's still hot and muggy out at 6 p.m. in Houston, and no, I haven't gotten a/c in the car since the last time I whined about not having a/c in the car.  Since I know the drug store carries only white, black and navy thread, I know that I will have to go to a fabric store to get  Cielo Blue  thread or one of its sisters or cousins so that I can get back home, reset myself into the sewing mood, and finish my shirt.  I know that Wally World might have at least a cousin of the color of blue thread I need, but Wally World on a Saturday is usually overrun with people, so I kept driving, straight into the sun, to get to the fabric store.   Finally, I get to JoAnn's and buy thread... and since I haven't eaten, I buy lots of thread, so now I can sew anything navy or black or red, or even pink for that matter and not have to buy thread.  I never remember my mother ever running out of thread, even random colors like  Cielo Blue .  I'm stocked up now and I actually remembered  not  to buy white.  I already have six spools of white thread.  I'm not sure why.  I never sew anything white.  On the way home, I stop by Kohl's to look at the clearance rack for a new bathing suit.  Didn't find anything... and I start the "haven't eaten wandering" thing and end up at a rack of t-shirts for five dollars.  (Since I've eaten, I've looked and found that I bought a purple t-shirt with flip flops on it.  It's the right size, so that's good).    I finally get back in the car and turn towards home.  I fall spectacularly off the diet wagon and stop at McDonald's on the way.  Oh, come on now, it was an  emergency .  Otherwise, I'd still be driving around and stopping at places and Lord knows what I'd be wearing tomorrow.

      Yesterday an article ran in the local newspaper:   urlLink Number of Protestants is Falling    In this article, it is claimed that for the first time in U. S. History, the population will be less than 50% Protestant.     One reason for the national decline, Smith said, is a failure to keep youths and young adults within the Protestant fold.  From the '70s through the early '90s, Protestant churches retained 90 percent of young people, but that dropped to 83 percent after 1993, he said.   Another reason: Once-nominal Protestants are more open to stating that they are no longer affiliated with any denomination, he said. In the survey, the number of people saying they had no religion grew from 9 percent in 1993 to 14 percent in 2002.  And, some people who once identified themselves as Protestant now call themselves "Christian," which would put them in the survey's growing "other" category. Latter-day Saints, Muslims and Eastern religions are also in the "other" category, which grew from 3 percent in 1993 to 7 percent in 2002.    Today, I was talking with two ladies (both who are old enough to be my mother) about this article and the fact that, after attending a Baptist church for nearly 10 years, I knew next to nothing about its history or doctrine.  In fact, I can quote you much more about the history and doctrine of the Methodist Church (which I grew up in) and the Church of God (Anderson, IN, where I went to college).    These ladies, both lifelong Southern Baptists, informed me that when they were kids, they learned the history of their denomination, the names and structure of the denomination present day and they learned the doctrine as well.  That's not the case any more.  Their opinion was, "the church as a whole has gone to the  feel good, self-esteem  doctrine, which you can't really sink your teeth into."  I chose my words carefully, but let them know I agreed with them wholeheartedly -- this is why I do not attend a Baptist church anymore.  After the last 3 1/2 years of turmoil my life has been twisted through, when it all came down to it, it was the liturgy and doctrines of my youth that stabilized me -- they were something I could sink my teeth into.    I, in fact, had a similar conversation with my roommate about three weeks ago, and I had shared some of this with one of the clergy at the church I'm currently attending.  By the way, the foundations of faith are taught there and if you want to become a member, you attend those classes.  It's not that they think you're unintelligent, they just want you to know what you're getting yourself into should you choose to be confirmed into that church.  Before you are confirmed, you will know that church's doctrine and it's history is readily available to you as well.  You will not ask a historical question in that church and get an answer like, "Uh...I'm sure it's recorded in a book somewhere."  I'm not knocking Baptists.  It's really an inter-denominational problem, this lack of knowledge about the heritage -- both of their own denomination's history and the history of the Church in general.  And, believe it or not, this lack of knowledge of church and Church history is deteriorating the quality of the legacy we leave behind.  Unfortunately, what we're leaving behind is a legacy of "Uh..." and "but don't you feel good about yourself?"  Learning about the faith of our fathers can help us in many ways.  First of all, even if they've been dead over 200 years, knowing that they faced many of the temptations and problems that we do today can give us hope that our faith -- and the Church -- can endure.  Second, knowing WHY your denomination sings certain songs, reads certain books, names buildings and colleges after certain people, can help shape your faith and understanding as well.  The article quotes another problem plaguing the church in general:     "Regular participation in a church is not as central as it once was, even if you are a believer," said Jack Marcum of the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies.  "It is much more individualized spirituality than it may have been in the past."    Regular participation in church... do you know how many kids and families I see at soccer games (baseball, etc) on Sunday morning?  There's nothing wrong with soccer, but with parents working later into the day, and the time demands reducing the number of coaches, many families are choosing the weekend leagues as an alternative.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with soccer, it's just that once you stop going to church to do something you really enjoy, it's extremely difficult to get motivated to get back into the swing of things.  Also, you are teaching your kids that soccer is more important than fellowship.  Chew on that one for a while.  As far as individualized spirituality is concerned, well, I call it ala carte spirituality... taking what you like and what fits your lifestyle from different sources and calling it your own.  Granted, there may never be a denomination or doctrine that you truly agree with every single part of it 100%, but there should be a denomination that reflects the majority of what you believe -- and if you never find out what they believe... you really are leaving yourself wide open for a lot of instability in the future, because God will shake you to your foundations at least once in your life.  I know this to be true, and the fall hurts.  A lot.  The Bible says we should be prepared to give an answer.  1 Peter 3:15 -- But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect...   How can you give an answer if you don't know what you believe?  It's extremely difficult to formulate an opinion if you don't know what the choices are.  If your denomination doesn't teach you what  it  believes and has believed for hundreds or thousands of years, what does that tell you?  How can you know that your denomination has suddenly gone theologically whacko if you never knew what the church originally thought and set out to do?  How can you teach your children what you don't know yourself?  They'll need to know a lot more than how to feel good about themselves, and if that's all we pass onto them, the Church as a whole is in bigger trouble than anyone will ever want to admit.  I encourage you to find out what you believe.  You'll be amazed and how that stabilizes your spiritual equilibrium, and you'll be amazed that you will be prepared to give an answer.

      DENTAL RELIEF...  Hallelujah, I'm back from the dentist... one filling, one root canal and two crown fittings later.  Thank God for insurance and interest free payments, otherwise, I would have had the equivalent of a car payment for a BMW for months.    I'm hungry, but still numb, so I'll wait and then see what I'm hungry for... but the office manager made me promise that I wouldn't eat anything sticky or chewy until my permanent crowns are on.    That leaves my choices for the evening as... SOUP... or SOUP.  :)  Addendum:  The Roomie let me eat some of her pancakes.  What a pal!

       FOUNDATION WORK   Today is my second paid holiday off since becoming a full time employee (oh, and by the way, I have a dentist appt. Wednesday -- woo hoo!).  So it would make sense that they would decide to do noisy foundation repair work in my building on my day off.    They are currently working on the unit next to ours, and the wall is vibrating slightly.  We have removed all our artwork from the walls just in case.  It's an old building, but I like living here and the foundation repair should ensure that there will be no more new cracks in our ceiling for some time to come.    I've been pondering the word, "foundation," since we got the notice Friday that today they would begin the final phase of the repairs.  They've been drilling holes and tearing up the landscaping for a week or so now, working as much as they can between the torrential rains we've had the past two weeks.  Today, they are ready to pour the concrete into the holes and shore up what's been crumbling beneath us.  The foundation of our country is wrapped up in the words, "In God we Trust," and many other phrases documented in our history books -- words connecting our country to God the acknowledgement of the ideals of the founding fathers who based the foundation of our nation on God and His principles.  Two hundred and twenty-eight years later, the foundation of our country is in desperate need of repair.  Decades of moral erosion (abortion, the sexual revolution, the confusion caused by role-reversing feminism, etc) and the forced removal of all things godly from schools (prayer, Bible clubs, restrictions on teachers, etc) has contributed to the moral decline of the entire nation.  The evidence is overwhelming, yet the nation as a whole will not acknowledge the evidence.  If they say, "you were right, we were wrong," then they'd have to acknowledge the sovereignty of God and face their own sin and they aren't ready.  I don't think they ever will be.  So if Christians are waiting for the government or the population as a whole to embrace Christianity and acknowledge the foundations of this country, we're waiting in vain.  The trouble is, can a foundation that has been weakened and eroded be repaired if the majority of the people in this post-Christian culture cannot agree that it should be repaired, how it should be repaired, or if it is even in need of it?  I don't believe replacing solid rock with the loose pebbles of of other religions, other lifestyle agendas, pro-choice, personal rights, selfishness, debauchery, and other anti-Christian methods and beliefs will stablilize this country.  Either we fall back on what we know is strong, or we start all over and build from scratch.    Starting over.  That's what scares me.  I fear that is where this country is headed.  Someday, I'm going to wake up and not even recognize my nation as God's anymore.  Every trace of Him will be erased, and people will have their "freedom" only to be trapped by it -- trapped in a culture where anything goes, and chaos reigns.  Hmm... some European countries come to mind.  Right now, we have a president who is trying to help with godly foundation repair.  As quickly as he makes the holes to be filled with something solid, someone with their own agenda is throwing their pebbles in with nothing to hold the pebbles together -- weakening us once again.  The president is trying to stabilize this country by doing what's right both here and abroad while the nation challenges his every move.  He is trying to help the Iraquis establish their freedom while America is willfully choosing to abandon their own freedom by thinking they are embracing it.  Someday, the world may have to mobilize and help liberate us from our own liberation.  Trouble is, America is one of the few countries left that was founded as, "one nation, under God."  God help us all.
