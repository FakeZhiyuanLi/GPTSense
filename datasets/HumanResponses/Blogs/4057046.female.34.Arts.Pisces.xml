      My first attempt, been wanting to create my own blog and finally the inspiration came this evening! So here is the medium to communicate thoughts and interests, hope we get a chance to know each other and create a community of friendship.  well, I am originally from Indonesia, born in Medan on march 9th 1970 to a lineage of 100% pure chinese from Pu Tian village in Fukkien province. My grandfather left china on a boat during the cultural revolution. Arriving in Indonesia where he established his roots, he worked diligently and soonafter started a business one after another, finally dedicating his energy in a printshop. He raised many children who in turn have many children. At the time of his passing he had children and grandchildren and great grand, approx 60 total. (He did contribute to world population). and that's how I grew up, with lots of aunts, uncles, cousins and siblings. A community of folks who are there for each other, all of us unique, different in our own special ways. We are a bunch of characters, and we are humans who continue to figure out life realizing that life is trial and error all the way.

      Someday we will all be old, someday we will all be senior citizens. Seniors are society's treasures. Their lives reflect the making of histories. They have so much to tell and share with us, and we have so much to learn from them. Seniors are slowly being exposed to the internet, a tool to help them connect with the rest of the world. Check out this website and experience their lives as they tell their stories online:  https://www.experienceseniorpower.com

      "Andrew Largeman shuffled through life in a lithium-induced coma until his mother's death inspired a vacation from the pills to see what might happen. A moderately successful TV actor living in Los Angeles, "Large" hasn't been home to the Garden State in nine years. But even with 3,000 miles between them, he's been unable to escape his domineering father Gideon and the silencing effect he's had on his son from afar. Stunned to find himself in his hometown after such a long absence, Large finds old acquaintances around every corner living quite unique lives as gravediggers, fast food knights and the panderers of pyramid schemes. Meanwhile, at home, he does his best to avoid a long-simmering but inevitable confrontation with his father. By a twist of fate, Large meets Sam, a girl who is everything he isn't. A blast of color, hope and quirks, Sam becomes a sidekick who refuses to ride in his sidecar. Her warmth and fearlessness give Large the courage to open his heart to the joy and pain of the infinite abyss that is life."  check out the Garden State Blog at: http://www.foxsearchlight.com/gardenstate/index_nyt.html

      Total body and face rejuvenation, all in 28 days:  "The Perricone Prescription clearly and succinctly explains the rock-solid laboratory research behind Dr. Perricone's revolutionary theories, revealing that inflammation at the cellular level, precipitated by poor nutrition, pollution, sunlight, irritating skin-care treatments, and stress, is the single most powerful cause of the signs of aging. Dr. Perricone gives you the knowledge and the tools to fight that inflammation from the inside out, while at the same time decreasing the likelihood of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and a host of other degenerative diseases."

      How many things in life do we take for granted? Take toilet seat, for instance. Can we afford to not have a toilet seat? Can we handle daily life if our toilet seat is less than comfortable? What is it like for big & tall folks to use standard size toilet seats day in day out? Do we live in a standard size world?  I came across an article this morning on non-standard size toilet seat. There is a company dedicated to bringing ease and comfort to big folks. To find out more, go to: www.bigjohntoiletseat.com
