      Which one is the genuine advice page and which is a shameless parody? According to the government, many people can't tell. See if you're smarter than the average voter:   Preparing for Emergencies   Preparing for Emergencies   Clue: there is no such government office as HM Department of Vague Paranoia.

      I've been lucky enough to procure a site meter that not only tells me how many people have visited my blog but also where they came from and, if they used a search engine, what they entered to get them here. So far I've had 4 visitors via Yahoo, who must have been sorely disappointed to end up here with the following search terms:  * Timothy Omundson * John Stalker adverts * birthday kiss * "Kevin Rahm" pictures  I must admit I am quite sad that there is so little stuff about Tim Omundson on the Internet that someone doing a web search for his name would end up here with my one crappy little photo of him (which was stolen from someone else's website anyway); he has recently joined the likes of  Robert Duncan McNeill  and  Colin Firth  as Men I Would Like To See More Of (on whatever level you want to interpret that) and I'm frankly amazed more people don't seem to think the same. Anyway, for the benefit of anyone else who strays here looking for him, there is a pretty good website about him (which doesn't always show up on search engines for some reason)  here .  (Actually, what I said a minute ago wasn't strictly true; there was also one Yahoo search last night for "Rachel Padden" - my maiden name - but I know that was my mum. To be fair, she did warn me she was going to try and find my website but for some reason I wasn't smart enough to remove all the swear words and other *controversial* stuff before she saw it. Oops.)

      It would appear that yesterday's plea for links and/or Blogshare purchases has actually had something of a positive response. So I feel it's only fair that I return the favour with links back (with the added bonus that they are actually both definitely worth a read even if they HADN'T been nice to me):   Confessions of a Salivator   Anyhoo   And in case that weren't already enough to cheer me up, I also managed to buy a decent pair of jeans today; they fit, they look good and I didn't have to get a remortgage to pay for them. (Trust me, if you've ever tried to buy maternity clothes, you'll understand what an enormous achievement that really is.)  Can things get any better?

      I know it's probably just a combination of boredom, tiredness and hormones but I'm feeling really pissed off today. I haven't the energy to go out and there's nothing to do at home except either watch TV (despite having about 300 channels the best thing on this afternoon is The Father Dowling Mysteries, which says a lot) or mess about with this damn thing.   Speaking of this damn thing; having been averaging about 20 hits a day for the first week or two it is now averaging about 3 hits a day, which isn't helping my mood. Now I'm under no illusions about what a boring pile of crap it is, but there are plenty of even worse ones that can at least manage double figures. I think I shall have to become a search engine whore (yes, even more than I already have) and use *interesting* keywords like "porn" and "XXX" to try and generate some interest.   In the meantime, though, if you've even vaguely enjoyed my blog then PLEASE link back to it. And if you don't have a blog of your own, go buy some of my  Blogshares . They're really good value, honest!

      I am now officially half-way through being pregnant - 20 weeks today! Hooray!  USELESS INFO THAT REALLY WON'T INTEREST ANYONE BUT ME: my baby is now approximately 25cm long and weighs just under 1lb. It can touch, hear, smell and taste. As well as being able to move its limbs (including fingers and toes) it can also open and close its eyes, swallow, hiccup and yawn. Over the next couple of weeks it will start to recognise my voice, and will be able to smile, frown and cry.  On the off-chance you ARE interested, you can find some pretty cool 3-D ultrasound photos  here . (Not of my baby, of course. Of random inferior ones.)

      Here are&nbsp;some of my&nbsp;favourite quotes (that I can think of at the moment, anyway; if you come back in a few days you'll probably find I've changed them all). I know a few of them are&nbsp;rather pretentious but I like them. And what's the point of having a blog if it isn't to inflict pointless crap like this&nbsp;on others?   Blue M&M, red M&amp;M; they all wind up the same color in the end.   Homer Simpson    This above all, to thine own self be true.  And it must follow, as the night the day;  Thou canst not then be false to any man.   Polonius (from "Hamlet")    I want to die peacefully in my sleep like my father, not screaming and terrified like his passengers.   Unknown    Don’t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind......the race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.   Baz Luhrmann   &nbsp;  Maybe,&nbsp;just once, someone will call me "Sir" without adding "you're making a scene".   Homer Simpson - again    In this life you can be oh so smart or&nbsp;oh so pleasant.&nbsp;For years I was smart; I recommend pleasant.   Elwood P. Dowd (from "Harvey") &nbsp;   And my current favourite (for obvious reasons):   Life is tough enough without having someone kick you from the inside.&nbsp;   Rita Rudner

      I used to be a&nbsp;huge fan of Leeds Rhinos when I was a teenager but drifted away from them when I went to Uni; I usually get to one or two matches a season now but that's all (compared to almost every home First Team, Alliance and Academy match back in 1999).   But I just read last night's match report on BBCi and thought it was worth a quick mention (full details&nbsp;can be found  here ). I do realise that gloating over this win after having had little interest for the last few months makes me a glory supporter but hey, what the hell; I suffered through&nbsp;Super League 1996&nbsp;when we only&nbsp;got 12 points&nbsp;all season under Dean Bell so I think I've earned it.   Note to Iestyn Harris: I think you've backed the wrong horse, mate.

      I'm feeling very continental at the moment; I am sitting with the balcony door open, drinking a (low-alcohol) beer. Someone in another flat is playing music loudly&nbsp;(Best of Chick Flicks; I own the album myself and recognise it) and if I close my eyes I can imagine I'm already on holiday.   Isn't life great?

      Well, Rob FINALLY managed to get some time off work and Mum's taking us both to Majorca for a week. (If you want to be REALLY jealous, see our hotel  here .)   Words cannot describe just how much I'm looking forward to this holiday; if nothing else, it'll be the last holiday Rob and I have for another twenty years or so where our main concern isn't looking for somewhere with a "Big T Club" to offload the kid(s) while we get hammered on all-inclusive sangria and reminisce about the days when we could go&nbsp;to a place&nbsp;that didn't&nbsp;have&nbsp;the entire under-16 population of Stoke-on-Trent&nbsp;running down the corridors screaming at 3am (for example,  here ).

      Hooray! It's my birthday!  &nbsp;  I must be honest, this morning's post was a bit disappointing; just one birthday card compared to two letters from the Inland Revenue (both addressed to Mr Rached Owyer, randomly enough).  &nbsp;  Fortunately I went out for lunch with friends on Wednesday and received a few things then, so the current total stands at seven cards and five presents (including, bizarrely, two keyrings - not sure if people are trying to tell me something). Also I haven't seen Mum, Dad or Rob's parents yet, so that should be good for another three cards at least.  &nbsp;  As I am writing I've noticed it's just started pissing it down outside. Given that the centre-piece of my birthday festivities this evening is an open-air concert (i.e. sitting in a field with a picnic), this is not good. I think God and I may have some bargaining to do.&nbsp;

      Certain adverts have offended my sensibilities to such an extent that I have sworn NEVER to purchase the products which they advertise. These adverts are:   * Anything with Carol Vorderman (writing "lower" on a blackboard and circling it isn't science, Vorders, it's just stupid)  * Anything with Linda Barker  * Vagisil (no explanation needed)  * Ocean Finance (where do they GET those people?)  * Maestro (with the creepy penguins) * Senokot (incidentally, what do you take if you want UNpredictable relief from diarrhoea?)  * Norwich Union (I'll quote you f***ing happy)  * Mobile Ringtones (especially that awful one with the gyrating hippo)  * 118118  * P.I. Helpline (would you trust this man with your kids?)  * Nationwide Awnings (as endorsed by John Stalker and his realistic dog)  * eSure (I would happily kiss goodbye to my "no-claims bonus" for the simple pleasure of running over Michael Winner)  * Heat Magazine  * Campino Sweets (they couldn't dub this more badly if they tried)  * Safestyle Windows  * Evian (with the scary babies)  * Gold Blend (anyone for swinging?)   However, to prevent this being a COMPLETELY negative post, I have decided to balance it by mentioning something I enjoy more than I hate all these adverts put together: morons on game shows. I'm not talking about people who don't know the capital of Uzbekistan* or who the 11th President of the USA was**, I mean proper, honest-to-God morons. For example:   Q: What radioactive chemical element has the symbol U?  A: Water.   Of course, Family Fortunes is the best game show for this. (For anyone who doesn't know, they survey 100 people and the contestants have to guess the most popular answers.) The best examples of these stupid answers can be found  here .   * Tashkent  ** James Knox Polk  (And yes, I had to look both of these up.)

      All I will say is this: how much eye-candy does one TV programme need?       &nbsp; &nbsp;     &nbsp; &nbsp;       Please Note: these aren't my pictures. I "borrowed" them from various places, however I've linked each picture to the website it came from in the hope that this will prevent anyone from suing me.

      Well, I am back: refreshed, revitalised and regretting having ever started this damn thing in the first place. Regardless, I have decided to stick with it, and kick it off properly by writing a bit about myself.  My name is Rachel, and I'm going to be 23 in....10 days. (Hooray!) I've been married to Rob for two-and-a-half years, and am currently 17 weeks pregnant with our first child. (My first child and the first of his that I know about, anyway.) We also have five cats (yes, 5). I've just finished my first year studying Medical Sciences at Leeds Uni and am taking next year out to have the baby and do maternal-related things. And that's pretty much everything you need to know about me, so I won't bore you any further.

      Having spent the last two hours trying to get this damn thing up and running (less than five minutes, my arse) I have now completely forgotten all the *interesting* things I had to say when I started.   Instead, what I have to show for my efforts is a profile consisting of a photo that makes me look both about 80lbs overweight (which I am) and evil (which I am not....I don't think) and a selection of "interests" that are, let's be honest, a bit iffy at best. (Example: what movies do I like? Hmmm. Wonder what's in the video player. Nope, not putting that. The DVD player? Star Trek. A definite improvement but not actually mine. Getting nowhere fast. Let me think....what other half-decent films have I seen in the last six months? Oh, sod it, that'll have to do.)   I have therefore decided to abandon Blog for the rest of the evening in favour of some undemanding TV, and will have another go tomorrow.

      You know your hormones are out of control when you start thinking "you know, I finally understand what all those women saw in Quincy".  Now I freely admit that my interest in the opposite sex - not least older men such as  urlLink him  (35),  urlLink him  (39),  urlLink him  (43) and even, in honour of the Olympics,  urlLink him  (54) - has escalated somewhat out of control over the past few months (thankfully Rob is very understanding; he knows that the particularly unattractive combination of excess weight and mood swings means that even if I did want to cheat on him - which I don't - I wouldn't get any takers anyway, so he just ignores me when I go off on one), but Quincy? Jack Klugman was aged almost 60 during the time he played the role, making him old enough to be my grandfather. I mean, there's older and there's OLDER.

       Well, I am back from my week in Majorca; tanned (sort of), refreshed and with a rather impressive vocabulary of German swear words, courtesy of water volleyball.  High Point: Fünfzehn-Null! Leck mich am Arsch!  Low Point: An elderly gentleman approaching me at dinner one evening and saying "I bet you don't recognise me with my clothes on", and me subsequently having to explain to my husband and mother that I'd accidentally knocked on his door thinking it was Mum's room, and he had answered semi-naked thinking I was his wife (as opposed to the "more obvious" explanation).

      Unfortunately, I have recently developed a moral objection to paying £20+ to have my hair cut in a salon when I can do it for free at home. My logic is that whenever I have it done "properly" I'm invariably unhappy with it and end up re-doing it myself a few days later, so this way I'm cutting out the middle man, so to speak, and saving money.  Also, over the last year I've changed my hair colour about five times (from my natural auburn to blonde, light brown, dark brown, red, and back to something approximating my "real" colour) with varying degrees of success and now consider myself to be something of an expert.  So, in preparation for my forthcoming holiday, I've spent the last hour cutting my hair with the aid of two mirrors (one stacked on an extremely shaky 5ft high pile of furniture) and a pair of "proper" hair-cutting scissors that I've had for about 10 years and have, frankly, seen better days. Now it's still wet (a moral objection to hairdryers that I'll go into some other time) and I've cut off about three times as much as I intended, but it does actually seem to look OK. Of course I'll fiddle with it again later and undo my good work, but for the moment I am proclaiming it to be a minor success.

      How the hell does Lois Lane not realise that Superman and Clark Kent are the same person? (Particularly as she's apparently sleeping with them both.) I mean, seriously; do these look even remotely like different people?      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      No, I didn't think so either.  (Incidentally, as per usual, the photos are linked back to the place I "procured" them from.)

      At the scan this morning we got an ultrasound photo of the baby. Now we don't have a scanner, but I had a play around taking photos of the scan photo with our digital camera and managed to get a decent-ish picture. So here it is:       I know it looks more like a "magic eye" picture than anything else at first but once you work out which bit is which it does actually vaguely resemble a baby; the blob on the left of the photo is the head (facing upwards) and the larger blob on the right is the body (if you look closely you can see a white line which is the spine). You can also just about make out an arm (the blob above the head) and a leg (the blob above the body) too.

      At least, we think so. The radiographer (or whatever the correct title is) says she's pretty sure, but you can only be really certain with a boy. So "it" will be henceforth referred to as "she", but we won't go painting the nursery pink just yet (not that we'd do that anyway, but you get the picture).  So, looks like I might have been right!

      I'm feeling quite emotional today; I'm going for my "20 week" scan (those observant among you will have worked out I'm actually 21 weeks pregnant today but they couldn't fit me in last Wednesday) at half past eleven and we're hoping to find out the sex of the baby.  To be honest I really don't have a preference whether it's a boy or a girl; I actually have a feeling it might be a girl but on the other hand if it's a boy at least we know what we're going to call it (Christopher - after my brother).  Anyway, watch this space for an update this afternoon......

      I read somewhere that if you put your audio player on random play and list the first ten songs, that it offers an insight into your personality. So, here are mine:  1. Feel - Robbie Williams 2. Stop Stop Stop - The Hollies 3. Heard It Through The Grapevine - Marvin Gaye 4. Misfit - Amy Studt 5. Tainted Love - Soft Cell 6. 9 To 5 - Dolly Parton 7. Generation Sex - Divine Comedy 8. Act Naturally - The Beatles 9. Stupid Thing - Aimee Mann 10. Walk This Way - Aerosmith (with Run DMC)  All that tells me is what I already knew; I have an eclectic taste in music. Not exactly rocket science.

      I'm not having a very good day. I had three things I wanted to get done today and none of them are looking likely. They are:  1) do all my washing ready for going on holiday. I've been avoiding the overflowing laundry basket for the last month or so and am now paying for this; I have about seven loads to do and am still on the first one (the machine is inexplicably taking over 200 minutes to do a 90 minute cycle). At this rate I will be finished at......about lunchtime tomorrow. 2) set up my blog to do a little message at the end of each post with what music I'm currently listening to. With mp3s this is difficult. With ATRACs (which all my music files are, due to me having been stupid enough to download SonicStage on the basis that I could get a free song download with every Big Mac), it is apparently impossible. 3) add a thing to my blog that shows referrers. The preference of most bloggers for this kind of thing seems to be "TrueFresco", but the only one of theirs that will fit in my sidebar is the one which only tracks referrers over the last 24 hours. For a blog that gets anything between 3 and 5 hits a day, this seems somewhat pointless.  If anyone has any advice as to how I might be able to solve any of these problems then please do  email me . (Obviously I don't expect too many responses for the first of the three but any suggestions for the other two would be greatly appreciated.)

      I can't believe that Mattel are resurrecting  Atmosfear  (I've just seen an advert for it). I remember my friend Pauline having the original version in the early 90s and, not to put too fine a point on it, it was shit. There was a video that came with the board game that was basically a disembodied head that occasionally yelled at you for......not playing fast enough, or something. I also seem to recall that before the game started you had to write down your worst fear and I always used to put "Pauline", just to piss her off (yes, I was funny even then).
