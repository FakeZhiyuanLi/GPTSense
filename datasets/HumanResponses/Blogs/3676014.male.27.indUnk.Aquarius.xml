      I just set up a one-person office in a small shit-hole so I can do my work and create some new business ideas, but it's so lonely!  I've got music, DVD player and all the Diet Cokes with Lemon that I could want, but I'm used to walking around and talking to employees.  Weird.  I need to get something else started so I can have an actual office again.  Does give me time to read Stephen King's new Dark Tower book.  I love these stories.  I'm also watching Wet Hot American Summer, which is one of the funniest movies of the more recent years.

      Johnny Cash's cover of Trent Reznor's hurt is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  I originally loved Trent's version, but the way Johnny's voice cracks and the great piano crescendo just makes this unbelievable.  What an album for him to leave behind before he died.  My father-in-law met him about a week before he died. He does alarm work in Nashville, and he's worked on the Cash house many times, but never met him.  When he was there the last time, he mentioned to the security guard that he'd been working the house for years and never met the Man in Black.  The guard brought him upstairs where they were sorting and separting all of June Cash's stuff (she had died a month earlier), and he said that Johnny didn't look good, but he had a strong grip and fierce eyes.    For inspiration, here are the lyrics:  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that’s real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know Goes away in the end You could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar’s chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feeling disappears You are someone else I am still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know Goes away in the end You could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way

      Wednesday nights with Ameci's, Kevin and Amy, watching the Whedonverse.  Now, no more Whedonverse, and I haven't found a good replacement for Ameci's yet.  Still talk to Kevin all the time, but it's not the same as heading to the movies or hanging out watching TV as he drank an entire bottle of wine himself.

      I helped start my company.  It was just my boss and me, working 17-hour days 7 days a week.  We did all the work ourselves, and I did most of it.  The company grew from nothing to a company that has 25% growth and will make $1.5 million this year (only three years later).  I wrote the majority of content for the website, helped with branding and wrote all of the marketing copy.  I sold the clients, hired and trained every single employee, and developed efficient procedures that would allow the company to continue to operate at its current level of profitability.  During these three years, my boss constantly harasses me.  He's an entrepreneur and has good ideas, but his people managemetn skill and his follow-up sucks.  He keeps making stupid suggestions that would only harm the company and then he accuses me of being against him when I stand up for employees are doing a good job.  He has a multi-million dollar house across from Patrick Stewart and two very expensive cars, and all of his bills are paid for.  I get paid commission only, even though my duties involved more than just sales.  I was expected to be involved in every aspect of the business development without getting paid for it.  And my boss still has the gall to say that I make too much money!  I tried to explain the simple concept that I only get paid if I make sales, so if the company makes a shitload of money, I make a smaller amount, but he's a fucking idiot.  So now, I move to Florida.  Finally, I divest myself of all of my managerial aspects for the company.  I write a 30-page customer service manual and procedural guide for the guy that I hired, train him for a week, and move.  Now I'm just doing sales.  However, now that my boss has me out of the way, he can try to implement all of this stupid fucking ideas, and this new guy thinks he's hot shit.  So if I do get involved, I'm spending time that I shouldn't, but if I don't, then the company that I lived and breathed for three years will fall apart.  All of their ideas are concepts we already explored yet eliminated because they were STUPID.  I just want to quit and now plan on doing so within 3 months, even though it will make me very sad.  I loved this company - it was mine - but he fucked it all up.

      Since I'm online 90% of my life, does that make me an e-male?  I file my e-taxes, order e-groceries, read my e-mail, read e-books, and I do e-banking.  I e-commute and participate heavily in e-commerce.  I send e-flowers and e-cards, and have an online e-photo gallery where all of my e-friends can e-visit and e-view.  We're all a bunch of e-freaks.  e-adam

      So the move to Florida from Los Angeles was uneventful, but the little things bug me.  It sounds spoiled, but it's really not.  The level of convenience, especially given out work schedule, was very high.  Things I'm talking about:  1.  Valet - okay, this is a luxury, but it's so much nicer to just give your car to someone else to park a thousand feet away.  2.  Grocery Delivery - we could order groceries from Von's every three weeks, and they would deliver right to the door.  All we had to do was unpack.  It was easy and really convenient, and I find that Publix, the biggest grocery chain in the Southeast, announced 4 years ago they were going to start doing online delivery, but nothing yet.  Get a fucking move on.  I don't want to waste half of my Sunday afternoon in the store with a bunch of annoying mothers with their kids and old ladies who are retired (so if you're retired do your shopping at 6 AM Tuesday morning, please!).  In LA, there was even a place called Pink Dot that you could order a few essentials, and they'd run them to your door within an hour!  One day when Amy was sick, I ordered NyQuil, Orange Juice, and Ben & Jerry's and they brought it right to her.  That was nice!  3.  Food delivery - is it too much to ask to have something other than pizza delivered?  Chinese, Mediterranean, Subs, why can't you just deliver?  No, I have to go pick it up, eliminating the reason why I wanted to eat at home in the first place. . . fucking bunch of backwoods towns here.  Okay, this sounds awfully spoiled and annoying, but we worked 7 AM to 8 PM M-F and wanted to save our time to spend with each other or doing fruitful pursuits.  In LA, we could.  Here, we can't, and it just makes me want to work less during the week.  I do have some rational thought behind my ranting.  You live in LA for three years and see if you don't get spoiled by many of these things.

      Yesterday I ordered a pizza from Papa John's and when I got it, there was a live roach running around in the box.  My brain actually shut down for a second, and I shut the lid, then had to ask myself "Did I really see that?"  I opened the lid again, and there it was, a roach about an inch and a half long running around the inside of the box.   I called and complained and the manager tried to blame it on me. (Did you leave the obx sitting on the floor for awhile?) What the fuck?  I told him no, and he asked if I wanted another pizza.  I don't think so!  Yeah, I want another fucking roach pizza.  When I'm on the phone with him, the roach climbs out of the box and takes off around the office and now I can't find him.  I'm waiting for him to crawl up my back while I'm on the phone or something.  So I had to order Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza, and it gave me heartburn like I knew it would.  Fucking Papa John's - never ordering from them again!

      The new book has been named:  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  I don't know if it has the same, magical ring to it like "Order of the Phoenix" or anything.  I'm sure it will be entertaining, but the title sucks.  "Harry Potter and the Mulatto" is basically what impression it gives.  Went to J.K. Rowling's website, http://www.jkrowling.com - it's pretty cool.  There are five Easter Eggs throughout the site, but they're pretty easy to find.  Dial MAGIC on the cell phone, use the eraser on the blank page in the Extra Stuff section to see the ingredients you need to double-click on throughout the site, click on the book with the question-mark and use the key in the Links section, and put the two medals where they belong in the Fan Site section.  For the last one, click on the black thing that looks like an O-ring.  It will take you to a door.  Open the door.  There are 5 bricks that you can click on.  If you click on them in the order of 3-4-2-1-5, they will disappear and you can click on the fan to see the new title.  Pretty cool site - very creative.  Sometimes if you stay on a page for a while, Peeves the poltergeist will knock things over and write his name.  Harry Potter mania.  Just the right pursuit for a man in his mid-twenties . . . or not.  I can't help myself, though.  The books are great!

       urlLink Feral Children - isolated, confined wild and wolf children   There is a website for everything.  Is this site for people who are trying to raise a feral child, or who want to raise a feral child, or it this a fetish site for people who masturbate and think about feral children?  I wonder if you could have a child raised by earthworms.  Or maybe dolphins.  A dolphin-boy would be cool.  He could be the bridge.  Dolphins will be our masters one day, I'm sure of it.  They're too damn smart.

       urlLink Buffyverse Dialogue Database - CLIP: 'SONG: I'll Never Tell'   My favorite song from "Once More With Feeling" is the Xander and Anya song.  It's the most clever song, and both Nicholas Brendon and Emma Caulfield do a great job.  If only Anthony Head also sang on this song, it would be perfect, because he has a cool voice.  The link is the lyrics.  I listen to it at least once a day while I'm working.  Joss Whedon has the uncanny ability to translate normal fears and anxieties into a world with demons and vampires.  His sense of humor and his ability to weave a word tapestry is amazing.  Read his Astonishing X-Men that he's writing right now, and Fray (about the last vampire slayer) is also a great story.  I'll watch anything he does.

       urlLink STUFF : NATIONAL NEWS - STORY : New Zealand's leading news and information website :   "They should have brought them in through the wardrobe.  Makers of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe have been told they can't bring into New Zealand the 12 reindeer needed to pull the Ice Queen's sled.  Filming of the $170 million production started last week. The animals, which also pull Santa's sled in one scene, are now likely to be created by Peter Jackson's Weta Workshop special effects department.  Film-maker Lamp-Post Productions hit a speed bump on the road to Narnia when it applied to the Ministry of Argiculture and Forestry for permission to bring in the reindeer and eight wolf cross-breeds. The ministry was happy with wolves in the Auckland studio - which has been set up on the former Hobsonville airbase - but drew the line at reindeer.  Dr Kerry Mulqueen, national manager of import management, said the United States reindeer population was suffering from the potentially deadly 'Q Fever'.  The wolves also had a rough ride - they had to be cleared by Waitakere City Council and the Environmental Risk Management Agency. The council cleared the pack, but Erma approval is still needed.  The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe could be the first of seven films from CS Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia books.  The books have sold 85 million copies worldwide."  This better be a good movie.  If they ruin one of my favorite book series as a child and as a teen, I'll have to hunt them down and choke them with Turkish Delight.  I still have no idea what that tatses like, but I bet it's not nearly as good as C.S. Lewis makes it sound.  I haven't read the books in about ten years, but I wonder if I'd still like them now.  I hope so, although that doesn't always happen.  Some things in my life that were ruined when I tried to re-visit them as an adult:  The movies Goonies and The Explorers, reading Reader's Digest, watching David Copperfield.  Better not happen with these, because now I have an urge to read them.

      Woke up at 6, into the office by 6:30, realize that my first appointment isn't until 10!  Now I get to sit around and look at the walls for a while.  Reply to some of my friends that I haven't talked to in 10 years and maybe stick Donnie Darko in the DVD player for a little while.  It's a good diversion.  I saw Spider-Man 2 twice in the last week.  It's a very good comic book movie, but not a good movie if you look at all genres.  I am a comic book geek, so I loved it, but some of the dialogue was very corny, which is okay in a comic book movie.  If a character in a drama said "If Spider-Man's enemies found about you . . ." wouldn't it seem ridiculous?  I don't know.  Back to staring at the wall . . .

       urlLink MSN Entertainment - News - 10 Dumb Moments in  Sci-Fi Cinema   "10 Dumb Moments in Sci-Fi Cinema  By Adam Berliant MSN Entertainment  There aren't a lot of good reasons to be a science fiction freak.  Sure, the genre gets respect, not to mention box office yield, but the poor innocent fans are still depicted as lifeless, dateless, and wearing Vulcan ears.  But, and we say this with love, sci-fi fans often deserve the reputation. Once people overhear some pale guy with wizard hair explaining how a light saber simply isn't possible, as the exposed plasma from the device would irradiate every living organism with a 5-kilometer radius, what are people supposed to think?  "Sexy?"  Yet, part of being a sci-fi fan is being its harshest critic, and so we can't help ourselves.  Its part of the fun to discuss what was and wasn't good science fiction. And to be clear, this has nothing to do with one's ability to enjoy a movie.  Did anything in "The Fifth Element" make sense? No. Did it kick ass? Yes.  So, this list is dedicated to the sci-fi fan. It's our stab at the 10 incredibly dumb things that occurred in otherwise really successful sci-fi movies in recent times. Don't look for B-movies or classics here. This is where the blockbusters went wrong.  Empire Strikes Back Imperial walkers attack the rebels "The Empire Strikes Back"  Why it's so dumb: So, the same company that brings you the dark side of the force and the death star decides that tall, slow, off balance elephant thingies with laser beam-shooting tusks are the best way to ferret out the rebels from their underground fortress?  Darth Vader may have been a patsy, but we all know he wasn't that stupid. If ever a huge planet destroying technology was the appropriate choice, this was it. Why we don't care: Seeing the walkers come into focus in the rebel binoculars was the moment when "Star Wars" fans realized that "The Empire Strikes Back" might indeed be cooler than the original. That scene alone could be the reason we paid to see four more.  The aliens need "Signs" "Signs"  Why it's so dumb: So many sci-fi fans have heard this one that it's almost bad form to mention it, but the blunder is pretty simple: Aliens navigate the vastness of space and find life on a puny planet. Then it turns out they need cornfields on that puny planet to point them to fresh meat. The only thing that made sense about the scenario is that the aliens wanted to eat Mel Gibson first. Why we don't care: As every sci-fi fan can tell you, "I want to believe."  Alien John Hurt feels better, so opts for breakfast "Alien"  Why it's so dumb: "Oh, thank goodness the acid-blooded crab thing fell off my face. Hey, do I smell scrambled eggs?" Despite a ship full of highly-intelligent technical and science people, the crew of the Nostromo decides not to quarantine their alien-toting buddy long enough to make sure there were no problems along the lines of, say, stomach erupting alien babies. Why we don't care: A hundred space horror movies later, including three more "Alien" flicks, a lot don't remember how terrifying "Alien" was in 1979. And while the movie was good and creepy up to this point, the "man gives birth" scene was the moment when the movie went from just scary to the scariest movie you had ever seen.  Terminator 2 Skynet sends a new and improved Terminator "Terminator 2: Judgement Day"  Why it's so dumb: There were at least 50 smarter, easier alternatives to whacking Sarah Conner and her unborn son other than sending back the hit-machine to the land of big hair. And after screwing up the first time, why would they try again after Sarah has had years to train both herself and her military mastermind child? How about sending a good old T-1000 back to Sarah's great, great, great grandmother's house around 1880? What would Kyle have used to fight? A musket? Why we don't care: The relentless pursuer is a suspense theme predating the written word, and for good reason. "T2" felt like high-budget vindication for all of us who actually saw and enjoyed "The Terminator" the first time around.  Will Smith uploads a virus to save the world "Independence Day"  Why it's so dumb: "Independence Day" had already lost all credibility when Will Smith climbed into an alien spacecraft and after a few moments, figured out how to fly the thing. But dumb turns to laugh-out-loud ludicrous when Will conquers the aliens with a floppy disk, in an absurd homage to "War of the Worlds." Will should have just stuffed a peanut butter sandwich into the disk drive. It would have had the same odds of working. Why we don't care: Because we like absurd homages to "War of the Worlds." Part of loving sci-fi is recognizing moments that only other sci-fi fans will recognize. The only thing better would have been if Orson Welles did a voiceover for "virus uploading" rather than simply seeing the words on the screen.  The Fly Dr. Brundle tries out his fly machine "The Fly"  Why it's so dumb: Jeff Goldblum's character is smart enough to defy physics and biology in every conceivable way, including appearing attractive to Geena Davis, but he isn't smart enough to keep his equipment free of household pests. But honestly, that's not the dumbest part. The dumbest part is that he rationalizes ever stepping into the thing. If Goldblum's "Jurassic Park" character were there, he would have said, "Don't be an idiot," and the movie would have been over. Why we don't care: "The Fly" was a movie with the world's easiest gimmick: Watch a guy turn into a fly. There should be more movies like this. Watch a guy turn into a lobster. Watch a guy turn into an oyster. This is what science is all about.  Velociraptors come off like geniuses "Jurassic Park"  Why it's so dumb: Jaws was a thoughtless eating machine and scared the swim trunks off of us, so why did we need dinosaurs fresh from the debate club? The book read perfectly well with the dinosaurs just being very, very hungry. The raptors, despite having acorn-sized brains, seemed to have no problem navigating a vast building they'd never been in before in order to corral Sam, Laura and the kids in the lobby. Maybe the T-Rex came in and ate them just for their severe lack of credibility. Why we don't care: You'd be challenged to find a single person from the "Land of the Lost" generation who didn't love some part of "Jurassic Park." And besides, it was nice to see the computer generated image technology put to use in a ways other than aliens and terminators.   Matrix Reloaded Agents throw punches at Neo "The Matrix"  Why it's so dumb: Anything that happens to you in the Matrix happens to you for real, right? Thus verifying the theory that if you die in your dream, you're really dead. So why then do the Agents decide that shotguns and kung-fu are the best way to take out Neo? If the Matrix is such a savvy computer, wouldn't, "Neo is in New Jersey, good-bye New Jersey!" be a pretty obvious solution? Why we don't care: Most sci-fi fans had read William Gibson's "Neuromancer" many years earlier, and "The Matrix" finally helped visualize what the hell was happening in that book.  Superman turns back time "Superman: The Movie"  Why it's so dumb: This is the classic problem with any time travel plot. If Superman can turn back time, why not turn it back a few years, find Lex Luthor, and break a few fingers? Instead, Superman turns back the clock just enough to save Lois from a not-so-shallow grave. Why we don't care: Actually, we do. This one is just too dumb.  Jodie Foster and company pass the alien MENSA test "Contact"  Why it's so dumb: Intelligent creatures from across the universe go to great lengths to let humanity know they exist in an otherwise great movie called "Contact." Life from distant galaxies intelligent enough to capture our rays, translate them, then dramatically send us the blueprints for a wormhole machine, somehow found it necessary to put those blueprints on a flattened piece of origami. Why we don't care: "Contact" was (finally) the insightful and thought provoking sci-fi movie fans had waited more than a decade for (with all due respect to "Species").

      My brother is a Marine.  He hates his life.  He has no guidance, no mentoring, and no authority to look up to.  Basically, he gets up, goes to a horrible job doing HR shit, and gets yelled at a lot.  It's no wonder Marines drink so heavily.  He makes almost no money and is generally an unhappy soul.  So he gets into an altercation with some other fuckwad Marine, and the other guy gets cut across his hand from a knife my brother had.  My brother was defending himself from this guy, who is bigger and stronger, yet my brother gets arrested.  The guy doesn't get in trouble at all.  Now my brother is facing (potentially) 30-40 years in prison because of this shit, and because the military is so fucked up internally, the attorney we hired can't do anything about it.  He has to wait for them to get their shit together enough to decide what to charge him with, whether or not he sits for a general or special court-martial, and all this other bullshit, and we're powerless.  My brother has the worst luck in the world.  He never gets away with anything.    Every single time he has done the slightest thing wrong, he has gotten caught.  Every. Single. Time.  You'd think he would learn, but no, he doesn't stop and count to 10 before he acts.  I hope he doesn't go to prison because he's my brother.  But I hope he stops making stupid mistakes and letting other people egg him on.  He needs to grow up quickly or one day he'll get killed or something.  Maybe if the Marines offered a mentor who would check up on him and make sure he's staying active and keeping his head above water, he'd never even get in trouble.  He's been with them for two years now, and he's still a kid.

      Poor photoshopping skills in full effect here (Not mine - I'm good at it).  First, here's a picture of Britney Spears at a German concert in a very tight outfit that is slowly riding down:     Then, here's a picture of Britney Spears with supposed "nipple-poppage":      Magically, her nipple has moved from the normal place it would be on any woman's breast to a spot five inches higher!  Obviously, the person who photoshopped this photo has never seen a real woman naked.   Just amusing.  I'm sure people will be selling this as the real thing now.  Like a nipple really makes a huge  difference.  When she's in a hidden sex video ala Paris Hilton, Geena Lee Nolin, or Pamela Anderson, then it might be interesting.

       urlLink Wired News: Bloggers Suffer Burnout   "Billmon's inability to keep up with the demands of moderating comments in the face of a job, family and other responsibilities is just one manifestation of a problem increasingly faced by popular daily bloggers: burnout. While they enjoy what they're doing, many find that keeping up with the pressures to post regularly and to be sharp, witty and incisive is often too much."   Thankfully, if nobody ever reads your blog and you never have any comments to worry about, being witty, incisive and posting regularly is not a concern.  Of course, in that situation, you're essentially talking to yourself, so you're like that homeless guy who has a full conversation about things that interest him, and nobody stops him on the street to argue or agree with him.  There's an analogy.  A blogger who gets no comments on his/her blogs is like a homeless man voicing his opinion to the empty air.  Now, please excuse me as I go piss on myself and drink a fifth of Jack Daniels out of a bottle in a brown bag.

      Is there anything worse than realizing it is Tuesday, you hate what you're doing, and you have three and a half more days before you can relax?  I don't think so.  I have to be home at 5:15 today so that I can urinate into a small cup for insurance coverage because Amy's firm has such expensive spouse insurance we had to get a separate ins. company.  Bastards.  I could listen to Rob D. from the Matrix soundtrack all day.  That one song is just very hypnotic.  I can always get more work done when that's playing, and I don't know why.  Can't get motivated on my new company because I have my current job, looking to buy a house, and trying to write a business plan.  Also trying to hire logo designers, design the database structure, plan the content and marketing, and figure out if it's going to be a success.  I need four more brains just to do what I need to do.  The house we're looking at might be awesome, though.  We'll see.

      No time to worry about the job.  We signed a contract on our house last night, and I need to be excited about that.  I'll figure out other ways to bring in revenue - I always do!    This is our first house.  In Los Angeles, we couldn't afford anything - even small houses were going for $300K in good areas.  If we were going to buy something, we wanted something decent.  Now we've found it!           Here's the front.  Not that cool-looking, but we can always paint it.       The pool is huge!  20 X 40, with a diving board and slide.  I don't think the slides are meant for large gorilla-men such as myself, but it's still cool.       One of two entertainment rooms - they both look out onto a huge screened in porch that could easily fit 20 people or more comfortably.  This is definitely a party house.       Master bedroom is a little blah and not as large as I'd like, but it leads to a small office/sitting area which is very nice.  Master bathroom has no tub - just a shower, and that's my biggest problem.  I'll have to install a big tub instead - I love baths sometimes.       The other living room, right off of the front door.  Very cool.       Another look at the living room.       Dining area right off the front door, across from the living room.       The patio overlooking the pool.       It's so exciting having a house!  Fuck work, even if I get fired from there I can find another good job.  I'm not going to worry about that.  I'm just going to look at the house and be happy.

      So, since I moved to Florida from Los Angeles and gave up management of my company, to become a salesperson, certain fucking losers have taken it upon themselves to transform my company into a horrible, horrible creature.  They ignore my input and make the stupidest decisions I've ever fucking seen in my life.  The people who run this company don't deserve to be called people.  They're more like those ugly, multi-legged insects that sometimes appear in the bathroom.  Basically living in shit and causing people to scream and point whenever they are seen.  That is an accurate description of the people who have taken over my company.    And now, I'm arguing with them about further changes that will cost our clients more money unnecessarily, and they stand fast.  They don't understand the concern, that our clients rely on us to provide a service that they pay a hell of a lot of money for, and to charge them more for stupid reasons and for services we should be providing for free is pitiful and sleazy, to say the least.    Instead of being intelligent about my arguments, and instead of realizing that I bring in more money to the company than the other salespeople combined, they suspend me from work for a week.  Now, first of all, I'm in Florida, so all it means is that I can't access the database.  Secondly, I'm in a sales position, with clients and appointments, and those are now just hanging in the balance.    So their fucking answer is to piss off more clients?  That's really professional.     I'm over it.  They have a very short period of time to allow me to begin working or I will quit, and they will regret it when it happens.

      I actually haven't been able to start work yet, because they're too busy fucking each other in the ass, apparently.  I just got an email that states that I have to become an independent contractor before they'll hire me back, even though they already agreed to.  Never mind the fact that I've been an employee for three years, doing the same job, and there are other people doing the same work who are employees.  Never mind the fact that I cannot contract out to other people for parts of the process.  Never mind that I have to do a schedule according to them, and I perform in a process that I have to adhere to.     I call up and ask them about this, and I'm told - no fucking lie - that it is essentially punishing me.  That since they suspended me, making me an IC is the way that they'll demonstrate what they do with those people who go against them.  If I oppose being changed to an independent contractor, they will fire me.  They said that explicitly.    Well, fuck them.  I'll become an IC for now, but in the end, I'll let the IRS make the final determination.

      This post is about my wife, Amy.  Since I have spent so much time in a horrid rant since starting the blog, I haven't mentioned her.  The reason is that I have nothing to rant about.  The reasons:    1.  She is pro-pornography and other seedy elements of free speech.  2.  She has no problems with comics, video games, and my obsession with both.  3.  She loves the Simpsons, Arrested Development, and Curb your Enthusiasm.  4.  She loves Top Secret!, Hot Shots, Airplane, and other genuinely funny movies.  5.  She's the smartest person that I know.  6.  She's understanding and unbelievably reasonable.  7.  She's a tough, aggressive attorney on the outside, and a wonderful, playful, cute girl on the inside.  8.  She loves being married to a gorilla, and helps me find bananas and trees on which to scratch my back.    So, see her pictures on my website at  urlLink http://adam.avitable.com  (either the Christmas pics, Wedding pics, or the gallery) and revel in the cuteness.

All of these pictures will also be at  urlLink http://www.avitable.com/adam/gallery.php , too.  To begin:       1.  Over 10,000 gallons of urine and other bodily fluids wash over these streets on a daily basis. 2. You know you're from Kentucky when . . . your closest celebrity encounter in LA is sitting on the ground next to the star of a Muppet. 3.  Tryouts for Vanna White's replacement. 4.  Not seen in this picture:  The four hundred men behind the camera doing a "panty check". 5.  Whenever  I  lay in the street, police come and beat me.  Why is life so unfair? 6. After this picture, the girls stepped on the Scott Baio star, rolled around with the Ernest Borgnine star, kissed the Harrison Ford star, and peed on the Britney Spears star. Another uneventful day on Hollywood Boulevard.

The man was briefly questioned and released without charge. He explained that he's reading newspapers to learn English, and writes down words that he doesn't understand to look them up later."   This is a definite function of news creating the problem. If they didn't write so much about bombs and suicide bombers, maybe the Japanese man would have been writing "Middle Eastern peace" instead.

       urlLink The Shitty Tipper Database   This is awesome.  Bitterwaitress.com will make you realize why tipping should always happen.  People who say that they don't believe in tipping should be shot.  And I have never waited tables in my life.  However, I know that restaurants and bars are able to pay LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE because of the income that those employees bring in with tips.  So when you're feeling high and mighty that they're getting paid to bring your food on time, so why should you tip, realize that your tips are very important.  At least 10%, even if the service has some problems.  20% is the most acceptable for an average person who doesn't have shitloads of money.  If you do have shitloads of money, tip 30%.  Why not?  It will only make sure you don't get spit, piss, or excrement in your next meal.  Cheap fucks.

      Reprinted without permission:   urlLink Entertainment Weekly's EW.com | Career Update: ''SNL'''s first breatkout star laughs about his disappearance :  "He's Still Chevy Chase (And You're Not) ''SNL'''s first breatkout star laughs about his disappearance. Chevy Chase struck comedy gold with ''Caddyshack,'' ''Fletch,'' and ''Vacation,'' but then he crashed and burned. Here's what happened by Daniel Fierman  Chevy Chase recalls the precise moment he hit bottom. It happened in front of unflinching television cameras, as he sat alone on a dais with his eyes masked by tinted sunglasses. Offered a hundred grand by Comedy Central to do a televised Friars Club roast, Chase was introduced to his place in history. And it was brutal.  He'd been roasted before, way back in 1990, and the place had been packed. Paul Newman, Robert De Niro, and Richard Pryor were there. The hall had been populated by a galaxy of well-wishers, movie stars, comedic geniuses, and beautiful girls -- all ready to lovingly trash the smart-ass behind ''Saturday Night Live'''s ''Weekend Update'' and classics like ''Caddyshack'' and ''Fletch.'' In the grand tradition of the Friars, it had been harsh but sweet, and Chase had left happy. So when he was offered the chance to do it again in 2002, he said sure. He donated the hundred grand to his wife Jayni's favorite charity and showed up in a fine mood.  What happened next was so awful that people who were there -- from audience members to Comedy Central staffers -- still have difficulty talking about it. Chevy Chase walked on stage and realized that almost none of his friends had shown up. He was led to a red overstuffed chair, where he blinked into the television cameras -- first stunned, then angry, then devastated -- as various basic-cable personalities and B-list comics marched to the podium and trashed him. Total strangers telling him that his movies were crap, his talk show was a comedy abortion, he had never been funny. Total strangers giggling about his addiction to drugs. There was no warmth in their comments. No real affection. Because after years of silence from Chase -- and hundreds of thousands of words written about his behavior during the late '70s and early '80s -- a consensus had emerged about the man. Everyone agreed without even having to think about it: Chevy Chase was a bastard.  He sat there in front of the world as it sank in for the first time. This was how he was remembered. This was his legacy. And when it was all over, he stood up, took a few bilious -- and dreadfully unfunny -- shots at his tormentors, and finally stared dead into the camera and uttered two words: ''That hurt.'' He fled the theater and went directly to his hotel room.  Paul Shaffer, the emcee of the roast, left the hall concerned and called Chase. Told him he was coming up to his room. Sat with Chase on the bed for hours, trying to figure out what had happened, why he was so loathed, what went so wrong. And then, finally, Shaffer told Chase what he needed to hear. ''Paul said, 'Chev, I could tell you were hurt. I could tell that. And I just want you to know that when you were on 'Saturday Night Live, 'you were generous to a fault. To everybody. Everybody loved you.'''  Shaffer left and Chase sat by himself in the dark. Crushed.  The ugly truth is that a lot of people don't love Chevy Chase. They don't even like him. You hear it in their gently damning praise, off-the-record slams, pointed nonanswers, and firm no comments. This isn't really surprising, because apparently the man possesses a truly spectacular talent for pissing people off. And at the height of his success he wantonly torched bridges and offended friends, often without even knowing it."  ''My first impression of Chevy was that he was really good-looking, but kind of mean,'' says Laraine Newman, who worked with Chase during his time at ''SNL'' and has been friends with him since. ''He teased in the way that a big brother would, [aiming for] exactly what would hurt your feelings the most. I say this as someone who loves him. And loves him a lot.''  ''He's a Philip Roth character, except that he's not very Jewish!'' laughs Buck Henry, who also met Chase on ''SNL.'' ''Even when he's giving you a compliment you just want to kill him. It's very strange and it's out of his control, not unlike Tourette's. It just made you shake your head.''  So when Chase fell in the late 1980s, he fell far, fast, and onto a bed of rusty nails. Truth be told, the quality of his work had been declining for a long time. Whereas once he saw the best scripts and got the juiciest paychecks -- complete with perk packages and stipulations that his name be at 75 percent the size of the title on screen -- by 1988 Chevy Chase was the kind of actor who'd star in junk like ''Caddyshack II,'' ''Christmas Vacation,'' ''Nothing but Trouble,'' and ''Fletch Lives.'' It wasn't that he wasn't funny anymore. Or even that he didn't know how bad the movies were. He just didn't have any options -- or goodwill -- to draw from.  ''I'd say I've done only five movies in my life that were any good, but that was a particularly bad time,'' he says over a cabernet in a gloomy corner of the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills. ''There was a whole slew of ''Cops and Robbersons,'' just films that didn't measure up, that didn't stand for anything comedically. They were purely for a paycheck. So I thought, 'Ah, let's try something new.' So I went to Fox with this late-night show.''  ''The Chevy Chase Show'' would become a cautionary tale of legend. The show that Chase pitched to Fox was actually pretty interesting, inspired by one of his heroes, 1950s television pioneer Ernie Kovacs. What he had in mind was a variety act, something branded by spitting nastiness and sly sketches, featuring only the occasional guest. The debut episode, for example, was supposed to have seen the host get bitten by a rattlesnake and nearly die within the first five minutes.  Slowly, though, those kinds of ideas were peeled away. First Fox nixed shooting on a soundstage, claiming they didn't have enough parking for a studio audience. Then they secured a theater in L.A. and furnished it with a set that looked remarkably like the ones used by Leno and Letterman. The programming team scheduled Chase's show at 11 p.m. on the rationale that it would give him a jump on the competition, but also conveniently placing him opposite the evening newscasts. And then? Then they advertised, plastering the country with gigantic pictures of their grinning star with a huge space between his two front teeth -- an obvious challenge to David Letterman -- complete with the tagline ''Ready to Fill the Late Night Gap.''  ''This whole program of pitting me against David and Jay.... I didn't want that at all,'' Chase sighs. ''I didn't want guests. I didn't want to do the same thing they did. It wasn't my gig. But it just turned into the same exact kind of talk show that they do. I've never really gotten into this with any writer, but it threw me into a depression that I had never had before. I couldn't be extemporaneous, only bored and frightened at the same time. I needed cards. Cue cards! My best work was always with my back up against the wall, improvising. It was just awful. I didn't know what was going on with me and I wasn't getting the right kind of help -- you know, medication. And I was clueless! I didn't know Queen Latifah from Queen Elizabeth. I thought she might be a queen! I had 12 writers, none of whom could make me laugh. I don't know. Maybe nothing would have made me laugh at that time. It was an ugly mess.''  His first guest was his old friend Goldie Hawn, whom he poignantly danced with before the episode was over. The show was savaged by critics and gleefully mocked by his peers. (Michael O'Donoghue, the legendarily scabrous ''SNL'' head writer, kept a tape of the show by his bedside until he died in 1994.) Schadenfreude ran red in the streets. Rumors of cancellation ran rampant.  On Oct. 8, 1993, five weeks into the humiliating run of ''The Chevy Chase Show,'' its host was on the way to a party. It was Chase's 50th birthday, and his wife, Jayni, had rented the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton hotel for a massive gala. All of Chase's friends were there. Movie stars. Famous singers. Family. Well-wishers. Hangers-on. Jayni had even gotten the band from the show to be the musical act. On his way into the ballroom for the big ''Happy Birthday to You'' entry, Chase felt a tap on his shoulder. It was his agent, CAA legend Mike Ovitz. Your show, Ovitz told him, has been canceled.  Then Ovitz told Chase to go tell the band.  Chevy Chase was done. Full stop. He kicked around Hollywood for a couple of years, but no one would have him. He battled depression, and embarrassingly got picked up for drunk driving in 1995. And finally, he decided just to get out of town.  ''It was the best thing,'' he says. ''I had plenty of money. It was time to move on. Start thinking in terms of your children [Chase has three daughters] and what they face day to day, living in that place with nothing but blond, blue-eyed movie-star wannabes and no seasons. This was in their formative years, just before puberty and adolescence, a tough period of hormonal overactivity that we guys don't go through. We just get hair on our d--- and want girls for the rest of our lives.''  So he moved his family back home. They bought a country house an hour outside his native Manhattan and built a life. He spent more time with Jayni, his wife of 22 years, whom he'd met on the set of ''Under the Rainbow,'' a terrible movie about the attempted assassination of FDR and the making of ''The Wizard of Oz.'' The time he's spent at home shows in his kids. All of the Chase girls -- Cydney, 21, Caley, 19, and Emily, 15 -- are pleasant, sharp, and funny; Dad thinks Emily is the one who inherited his knack for comedy. He bought a few pianos, scattered them around, and set about teaching himself jazz. Chase would still occasionally get picked on, most notably by Howard Stern, who prank-called him at five one morning in 1992 after Chase made some mildly deprecating comments about Stern on CNN. Chase tried to be polite, but Jayni picked up the phone and started screaming. ''When my wife loses her temper, whoo!'' says Chase, fluttering his hand in front of his face. ''What can I do?'' Stern has been playing that tape mercilessly for years.  Other than that, though, Chase wasn't much abused. Just gently forgotten. He likes to say that most of his old friends are dead -- Belushi, Gilda Radner, ''National Lampoon'''s Doug Kenney -- but the truth is that after 1993 he lost touch with almost everyone he was close to. People like Steve Martin, Laraine Newman, and Paul Shaffer all say they barely talked to him in those years. He was politically active, helping with Jayni's environmental charities and fund-raising for the Democrats. (He lives near the Clintons and calls Bill, well, Bill.) The only time his name would pop up was in books like Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller's ''Live From New York,'' an oral history of ''Saturday Night Live'' that painted him as brilliant, arrogant, and casually cruel. (When asked about the book, particularly some nasty comments made by Will Ferrell, Chase shoots back, ''You wanna see his apology letter?'') He took a few roles in minor movies. Some of them were -- purely incidentally, from his point of view -- successful. He marvels at the $1.5 million check he got a few months ago for residuals on ''Snow Day.'' ''I did a picture about a talking goose, too,'' he laughs. ''I don't know what happened to that one. I think they're looking for distribution in Canada.'' And he had an awful lot of time to think about that Comedy Central roast, and the night spent with Shaffer in a hotel room in New York.  ''I mean, nobody prepares you for what happens when you get famous, and I didn't handle it well,'' he says (though his childhood in a wealthy, highly driven New York society family had certainly prepared him for money, which may be why he still has more than his share). ''I was a young, new, hot star and I had the unbelievable arrogance of Ty Webb [the golfer in 'Caddyshack'], the guy who says, when asked how he kept score, 'According to height.' As time went on, the strident narcissism and arrogance slowly diminished. But it was definitely there. I'm older now. And a big crybaby.''  Chevy Chase is, indeed, older. He's 60 -- Chevy Chase is sixty! -- and he walks with a stiff, rolling gait, the product of decades of pratfalls and whacks to the groin. He's a little puffier. The long, lean preppy face is now round, and made rounder by big, owlish glasses. Wearing olive tennis shorts, white sneakers, and an Italian racing cap, Chase looks like nothing more than the goofy dad next door. And as Cydney, a student at Princeton, comes sauntering into the pool house of their home, rolling her eyes at her father and the journalist dim-witted enough to want to talk to him, it's clear that's exactly what he is.  It's only when you stroll through his house -- a comfortable sprawl, piled high with books and packed with overstuffed couches -- that the Chase legacy is revealed. He dusts off $6 million movie contracts from the mid-1980s, smiles at old photos from movies like ''Three Amigos,'' ''Caddyshack,'' and ''Fletch,'' and laughs to the point of tears at an old letter he had framed from Michael O'Donoghue to The San Francisco Herald. (The letter is not only too profane to reprint here, it's probably too profane to reprint in Hustler.) Leafing through the old pictures with presidents and correspondence with stars, it all comes rushing back. Chevy Chase is a comedy god.  ''Chevy in a room is one of the funniest people I have ever, ever seen in my life. And I've been around almost everyone who is funny in the last century,'' says Buck Henry. Lorne Michaels agrees: ''You can't imagine the beginnings of ''Saturday Night Live'' without Chevy,'' he says. ''He was the absolute center of the show. The way that he's funny [can] rub people the wrong way. But he has a great heart.''  Wandering through his house, shooing off the chickens and dogs and cats that meander in the yard, past the tennis court and the barn that serves as the office he shares with Jayni, Chase tells terrific stories. Like the time he got in a fistfight with Bill Murray. ''It was Belushi that started it, I found out later, by bad-mouthing me to Murray. But he got his, because while we were swinging at each other, he was in the middle and was the only one who got hit! I would have won the fight. Absolutely. I'm taller. I have a longer reach. And I had to fight a lot when I was a kid.'' About Belushi, ''you couldn't really call John a genius. He was more of a brick. A brick with hair on his back. I used to say [professorial voice], 'I brought him here. I pulled him out of the water and shaved his back and gave him books.''' Of course Chase also loved Belushi's outrageousness, a quality he admires as well in the work of the Farrelly brothers, particularly ''There's Something About Mary.'' ''When I saw Cameron with that sperm in her hair, I thought, 'Well, now we're getting somewhere!' That was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.''  Chase's anecdotes have a well-worn, romantic feel, and in the intervening pauses, you can tell that he misses the old days -- and that he's a little at loose ends. His children are raised. His home life is just fine. And just how much can a guy play jazz piano anyway? Sweeping his hand past the four cars in his driveway, a trio of eco-friendly Priuses and a Mercedes S600 -- ''I'm supposed to drive the Prius,'' he says in a conspiratorial whisper. ''But the Mercedes is much nicer'' -- he confides that his kids have been pushing him to get out of the house. Maybe start working again. It's not something he thinks is totally crazy. He spent a month out in L.A. this spring taking meetings. He fired his old agent and hired some new kids to represent him. Buried the hatchet with Bill Murray, whom he'd never really squared with after the fight. He even shot a small part opposite Naomi Watts in Ellie Parker and is aiming for a role opposite Jim Carrey, a comedian he greatly admires. But more than anything else, he discovered people in Hollywood not only remember him. They like him.  ''All these young people running these studios and independents, I didn't know any of them!'' he says. ''But they were all in some sort of awe or whatever about seeing me. 'Where have you been? What have you been doing? God! We grew up on your films!' I was really received well, as opposed to when I was there last.''  Laraine Newman, Chase's friend of three decades, likes to say that he has awful demons but a wonderful heart. Those demons killed him in Hollywood. But if anything is going to bring him back, it will be his heart.  ''You know, everybody has disasters,'' says Steve Martin, a friend from '''Three Amigos.'' ''And then you have a hit and then the disasters don't matter. So, if you think about it, everybody is just one hit away from being exactly where they were. Chevy is one hit away. It will happen. He'll get that hit. And he'll be back.''  I hope he does come back. I have enjoyed every single one of his movies, tv appearances and commercials. I think Chevy Chase is one of the funniest people I've ever seen, and he's one person that I would love to meet.

      Granted, it's been Photoshopped, but there are still plenty of funny captions that could be developed:        1.  My grandmother and Uncle Hussein trade brownie-making tips. 2.  The "Hussein-ator home intrusion preventor" also keeps pests, old ladies and rain away. 3.  Who's more frightening?  Irish-Catholic matriarch of a family of hooligans, or a murderous dictator who killed hundreds of thousands?  One dispenses acerbic remarks and criticisms with unerring sarcasm and the other dispenses bullets with unerring accuracy. 4.  Neither of the people in this picture are wearing any pants.

       urlLink IOL: A Step Beyond   Just a few choice quotes:  "A chain of private California schools - which taught immigrants there are 53 states in the United States and four branches of the US government"  "Congress had two houses - the Senate for Democrats and the House for Republicans; that the US. flag had not been updated to reflect the addition of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico to the "original" 50 states; that the federal "administrative" branch oversees the Treasury Department; and that World War Two occurred from 1938 to 1942."  "The workbook also refers to the play, Death of a Traveling Salesman, not Arthur Miller's classic Death of a Salesman."  Isn't that just special?
