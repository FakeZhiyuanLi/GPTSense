       &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didnt blog yesterday, yesterday was fun. After church the youth group went to christian city. I felt pretty good helpin out with the "elderly" people. We took people in wheelchairs to and from the service and the&nbsp;boys did communion. The lady who i took in the wheelchair was very nice. I bet those old people hate us.... o well,&nbsp;u gotta love 'em. Then today adam came over n we went to the movies with callie n *shelby*. :-D We had a lot of fun. Man i love shelby s0o0o0o0o0o&nbsp;much i cant even describe it in words.
