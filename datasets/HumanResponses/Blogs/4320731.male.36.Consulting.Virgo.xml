      Now with a title like that, I know you, gentle reader, are asking "How can a tax cut that benefitted the rich be progressive?". As it turns out, as long as you do the tax cut correctly, it will benefit everyone and create a more progressive tax structure (the wealthy will pay a higher percentage of the overall amount of income taxes). And it also turns out the the soundbite "Tax Cuts for the Rich" is nothing more than Liberals playing the class envy card yet again.   urlLink CBO: Tax cuts made system more progressive   Liberals like to point out that the tax cuts benefit the wealthy disproportionally in terms of dollars. This is true. In terms of dollars, almost any tax cut will put a lot more dollars in the hands of the top 20% of income earners than it will anyone else. But why is this? It's because the top 20% of income earners who are paying the lion's share of the taxes. According to the  urlLink Congressional Budget Office , the top 20% of income earners pay 78% of the taxes. When you expand that to the top 50% of income earners, the percentage goes up to 96%+! So, yes, tax cuts will end up putting more money in the hands of people who are making the most money.  So given this, how did the Bush tax cuts end up making the system more progressive? Simple, by reducing the tax burden across the board for all income levels, the highest income levels end up paying a larger share, as a percentage of all income tax collected, than do the lower income levels. Let's look at a simplified example:  For each 100 dollars the government collects, let's say the top 20 percent pay $70. The second 20 percent of income earners pay $20, the third 20 percent of income earners pays $7, the fourth 20 percent of income earners pays $3 and the last 20 percent pays $0.  Now the government reduces the top four brackets by $10, $8, $4, and $3 as a tax cut. Now the top 20 percent of income earners will pay $70 - $10 = $60. The second 20 percent will pay $20 - $8 = $12. The third 20 percent of income earners will pay $7 - $4 = $3, the fourth will no longer pay taxes, and those who didn't pay any income taxes before the cut would still not pay any income taxes.  So, before the simplified tax cut example above, the top 20 percent on income earners were paying 70% of all taxes ($70 / $100) and now they're paying 80% of all taxes ($60 / $75). So the tax cut, which benefitted the top 20 percent the most in terms of dollars not taken by the government, is now paying 10% more of the total taxes taken by government.  Yes, tax cuts can result in a more progressive tax system.

       urlLink Iranian girl is executed for 'Sharp Tongue'   I suppose it's just the society I live in. You know, that right to free speech that so many love to use and abuse. I guess growing up with that right makes this story so much more difficult to understand.   The judge personally pursued Ateqeh’s death sentence, beyond all normal procedures and finally gained the approval of the Supreme Court. After her execution Rezai said her punishment was not execution but he had her executed for her “sharp tongue”.   So this girl committed some kind of crime, which didn't warrant a death sentence, but because she had a "Sharp Tongue", the judge decides she needs to be killed.  You can say what you want about Islam being a religion of peace, but it's actions like this that give Islam a bad name.
