      Today I went to CR's place, and he made a lovely dinner for me and pat, get a chance to meet his lovely wife and adorable baby. I've been contemplating that if I should drop all I have in the state and go back home to J to see if we can work something out. Many of my friend said that I should move on, but I just can't get her out of my mine, I know that I love her very much. There a line from a movie I saw it was 'true love lasts a life time' maybe J's my true love after all....Is it worth the risk?

      First of all I have thanks Julia for her kind comment. I stumble upon her blog by chance. As I read her blog I wonder hey this person think like I do. Of course she is way more articulate than I do. Since my partner at work turned in his 2 weeks notice, I pretty much work alone. I would like to tell you guys a story of mine, but I just don't have the energy to write for now maybe tomorrow.

      In the news:  urlLink Human Piggy Bank  Your brain sometime can be your biggest enemy in the world, it'll makes you do something that is totally fucked up. tonight I have listen to a group called  urlLink Scala On the Rock : they are a youth choir that sing cover of song like creep, and with or without you. They sounded hauntingly beautiful! I almost cry when I hear their version of creep! So check them out guys! I always thought I like sleeping; it's my hobby of some sort. Now I come to realize that I slept so much is because I have depression. Well anyway back to work tomorrow. Also i have put up a new link on the right.

      I'm a hopeless romantic. Get what I wanted or nothing at all. Yes it is my biggest downfall. Should I change the way I am? Perhaps, but I can't stand the thought that I have to settle with thing that I don't care........ went out to lunch with C today. It was a good lunch and we get to know each other a bit.... Will this be a beginning of a beautiful friendship, just might .............. But everywhere I turn, there's always the shadow of J standing in corner somewhere. By the way i had Strongbow with my lunch today which makes me somewhat delighted.

      Well been working alone for the last few days , my partner gonna leave for a better job at Hilton, I wish him luck. Tomorrow I might going to have a dinner with this girl I work with.. We'll see how it goes. Which makes me think that if you always get what you really don't care about, is that suppose to be better than you're getting nothing at all??? Am I a horrible person to think it is more depressing to get something/someone you don't really care about? ain't life a bitch huh...

      After 3 days of non stop works, the 1500 people party will be departed tomorrow. They've hired 3 singers/groups to perform each night. First night was the Aerosmiths, then Davy Jones form the monkeys(I know right), tonight was Gloria Estefan. They're all sounded good live.  Today I also started to drink before I go to work ... Is this the beginning of the end? We'll see......  Lately I get hooked on those songs by My Bloody Valentine. Although you can't really hear what they were singing, but their vocal track blended in really well with the guitar noise...... in the mean time check this site out:  urlLink Get Your War On

      Well been working 12 plus hours a day, that's a good thing I don't really care much about the overtime I'll get, it just that I don't have to drink myself to sleep these past 2 days. My depression is really taking a toll on my life. I don't know if I'm a bad person or did I do something that I deserves the bad luck, but' I just can't seem to get a break lately. I did some thinking about when was the last time I was happy...Well there's a week before xmas I was, but it only lasted for that week..... Before that it will go back to 10 years ago that I was a happy person. Anyway nothing last forever check this out  urlLink barbie and ken has split . Not that I care or there's any real meaning to it, it just that even toy just like real life........

      Last day of my days off for the week. Went out to the books store. There I saw this one girl has a 'Spock''s ears on her. I didn't know it has became a fashion statement. It's kinda stupid really. On my way home, I saw there's something on this big 18 wheeler, it has 'Real man LOVE Jesus!' on it. Too bad I didn't have my camera with me. We all know what it means, but it sounded kinda gay to me...... I've been having this weird memories flashes happen to me. It happen all the time lately and random too. Like I'm driving then suddenly I would like transported to the time when that memory happens and back to present time, and I think I was out for like a second or two completely. If anyone of you know if it a sign that I'm going mad please use the comment under this post to let me know. Last thing is check  urlLink this guy  out he made some nice music

      Have 2 days off and I did nothing today. I often have many things would like to put it here to share with you all(although I don't think many people will read this), but I always forget to mention it. Haven't watch TV for at least a month now, I relied on my online radio station to keep me informed. For those of you work in the office and have a speaker I would highly recommend you to check out  urlLink this  online broadcast! Eclectic music all day and news.

      Well got off from work early today went over to pat's, on the way there we stopped at the liquor store to get some shit. There we met this trashy white girl yet she does looks kinda good (nice legs and ass). She asked us if she can get ahead of us since there's a long line at the store(Saturday night).  We are not in a hurry so why the hell not, and then she asked us if we want to follow her to some club or a party, I looked at pat like hey the girl is asking for it.... She keeps on going like 'we have 3 other girls 2 black and 1 white if that's ok' ......Well pat married so of course it ain't gonna happen. ..... it's nice of her to ask I guess. On my way home I was thinking she doesn't look bad at all, but she dressed like a street whore or something, what a waste... But don't we all are wasted in some ways? other question is why the hell i still thinking about it .... man i hate to be sober

      It's over between me and J. Yesterday I worked outside at the lawn. Gorgeous weather almost like in paradise. On my right there's a wedding going on, and my left children playing with their parents at the pool, right in front of me is this picture perfect sunset. All the best thing in life was surrounding me, but I can't feel the slightest joy......I'm this living dead walking on this earth unloved......Even I have all these thing around me I have no one to share with. All I feel is rejection, betrayal, and hate. Worked 6 days and 13 to 15 hours a day, it's not that I love to work so much, it's just that I have no where else to go......Also physical pain does take the mental pain away.

      how can you stop loving someone? i really really want to know how!!!!!Have msg J the night before, after that i've been having nightmare about being rejected by her. and i couldn't sleep at all. Why do i have to get something i couldn't have. She didn't give me any answer, but i should know better i can't never make her love me again. it has to come within her and there's almost no chance of that. i'm too stubborn to give up. i know i'm killing myself here. i'm withdrawing from my family, my friends, and all human being alike. is it not fair to blame that on her? yes. One thing that i can't get pass is that how can you just stop loving someone all of sudden without a third party involed???????? tell me how, then i can die in peace...............if only i have a gun in my hand i would do it.

      I don't want to get over you I wish I could take a sleeping pill, and sleep at will And not have to go through what I go through I guess I could take Prozac, right Or just sigh all night at somebody new Somebody not too bright, but sweet and kind Who would try to get you off my mind I could leave this agony behind Which is just what I'd do if I wanted to But I don't want to get over you  Cause I don't want to get over love I could listen to my therapist, pretend you don't exist And not have to dream of what I dream of I could listen to all my friends, and go out again And pretend it's enough Or I could make a career of being blue I could dress in black and read Camus Smoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouth Like I was seventeen, that would be a scream But I don't want to get over you...

      The amount of indie music I've listening to should have killed me by now, all those songs sang about how miserable one can be. maybe if i ever have a family(which i doubt that i'm that lucky)i wouldn't let my teenage kid to listen to The Smiths and such. Just finish watching 'thirteen', it makes you don't want to have any kid. The world really not that well for raising children at all. I found out that if you were crying in your dream, you're REALLY crying, that's what happened to me last night............ Now if it only true that i can just eat this  urlLink NutriGrain  to feel as great as they are.

      Emailed J to see if she interested in work thing out between us, all she said was she will think about it. I don't know..... To me it sounded like 'No'. I don't think I will dumb enough to ask her the second time to see if she'd done with the 'thinking'. Many friends said why the hell I want her that much. It may sound corny to you, I feel like she is the missing part in my life, she is the one that can complete me......... Don't you hate when people tell you that you're nice/good guy you can have better thing/person than this........I will flip on people when I hear that, what the Fuck! If I can't hold on to something that is less, how the hell I can get something better??????????? What's good about being a nice/good guy if you can't get shit!?!?!?! no one get online on a Friday night, everyone out to do something fun, and I just come back home from work. Summer is here already in this fucking place, sunshine everyday. i don't want to see winter goes away and leave me here all by myself. My winter of discontent hasn't over, it should be cold and dim everyday. It's not fair.

Then I wonder if love is like keeping a gold fish to her. Fist you get really into it, over time you lost your interest, then one day when the fish die it is all over. This is the last time I will ever talk about me and J as there's really nothing more to say, her face is fading slowly in my mind.........

      While driving home for my mother's birthday(actually it was yesterday), listening to NPR about some books review(who would have though 'I' enjoy listening to book review!!!???), there's a book just came out called 'Love Monkey', sounded like a us version of Nick Hornby's novel, I think I'll get one and check it out. Anyway the writer was asked about what is his view on dating. "well dating is 2% of sex, and 98% of deciding where to go to eat." he answered. So true. Many thoughts came to my mind, but now I have totally forgotten all of them. One thing for sure is I was thinking of her. Benson and Sarah's baby is coming out tomorrow, and I shall take picture of Baby 'Juicy'.

I told him that I only want to find a solution to the problem that's all, and he said that there's no such thing as 'solution' in this world, all I can do is walk away from the problem. perhaps walk away from it is the only thing I can do.

I guess I have to suffer my own decision for the rest of my life.... here an qoute from the moive 'Bagger Vance' and i live by it nowday....  Rannulph Junnah: Now, the question on the table is how drunk is drunk enough? And the answer is that it's all a matter of brain cells.  Hardy Greaves: Brain cells?  Rannulph Junnah: That's right Hardy. You see every drink of liquor you take kills a thousand brain cells. Now that doesn't much matter 'cos we got billions more. And first the sadness cells die so you smile real big. And then the quiet cells go so you just say everything real loud for no reason at all. That'ok, that's ok because the stupid cells go next, so everything you say is real smart. And finally, come the memory cells. These are tough sons of bitches to kill.  i hope that the rate of liquor i have everyday sooner i'll finally able to kill those memory cells them bitches.....

      You just have to be sure you're doing the right thing. I mean it's very easy to forget - she's just sitting there in the pub with her new friends and her new life and her new hair, and it's been five years but you'd know just to look at her.   I wasn't even sure it were her at first, I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our firneds to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up talking about our new homes, our new jobs and our new birds.   She says she's been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she's changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out.   But you have to remember there's this other kiss. She's at home, wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you work hard on this kiss and you know it inside out, it's as much yours as it is hers,And it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarassment but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week.   You can see her breath in the air between your faces as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and you might wonder what you missed but you have to remember the kiss you worked so hard on - and you'll know you've done the right thing.

      been in the bad cycle of moods, can't sleep most night or just slept all day...... Got drunk most of the time, it's the only way i can be relax these days....... J didn't reply my email since her birthday, and that is the offical ending i guess(atleast in my mind). All of this loving her ,hating her ,missing her are getting tiresome. Will i ever feel same way toward other people? Not likely... Love doesn't happen once most time let alone twice right?........  went home last weekend, get to play with baby stella a little, she grows so fast! seem like she likes me ..i hope.... i can't stand living in my own home anymore all those memories haunt me every corner of that place. i didn't sleep for a day before i head back to work.......
