         Ok me and my bf are soooo happy now I am soooo much in love with him it's unreal, I never thought in my life I could find someone to love me for who I am, he is so sweet and generous, gawd I can't wait to get married to him :) I love his daughter as well, the only person I don't love is his bitch of an ex lol I think she still has some feelings for him, and I wouldn't be shocked to find out if she did have some feelings for him heh, he is a great guy after all and a very attentive lover :)  He is getting some new furniture for his place on the 15th, I can't wait he is such a sweetie!  As far as my life goes beyond him, well, I am still jobless :( sucks because I really am trying over here and no places are calling me back, it's starting to piss me off royally bah, I'm a good damned worker, and have only been laid of once, so I don't know what their problem is, they don't know what they are missing! haha

       Ok well, howdee, this is my first post....My name is Cindee, I'm 23, from California, and am TAKEN!!  I want to start this blog just to give out some personal opinons, share memories, etc, so bear with me if at times it's boring or what not heh :|  The reason why this is one of the worst day's ever, I hit a dog today, I don't want to go into the story...I was shaken up and freaked out by the fact that I hit an animal, I am a very sensetive person and I don't care to inflict any emotional or physical pain, bah anyways long story short, the dog is ok, not even a scratch on the dog!    Ok that is all for today thanks for viewing this hehe!

       So I took this test on emode.com and this is what the test says..  Cindee, you tend to gravitate toward romantic partners who have a Preoccupied attachment style.   People with a preoccupied attachment style tend to show a great deal of openness and are eager to get close in a relationship. They can be very devoted partners.   Attachment style begins in infancy with the interactions we have with our parents or primary caregivers. Through these early relationships we begin to understand the dynamics and patterns of close relationships and we carry this perspective into our adult relationships.  Psychologists call your attachment style Preoccupied.   You tend to worry about being abandoned in your romantic relationships. You have a strong desire for closeness, but may feel that others seem unwilling to get as close as you would like. It's likely that your openness to relationships is one of the first things potential partners notice about you.   39% of those who have taken our test share this style of attachment.   Your answers on our test show that when it comes to relationships you have grown beyond your earliest attachment issues. While you may not have every issue resolved, you're making substantial progress at establishing healthy relationship patterns.    True, very true, I love my bf with every part of me but I am thinking we need to take a permanant break, I don't know though, it feels as if I will never find someone who I can connect with, I mean I could connect with him at first but I think he might be getting bored which sucks and I have no idea what to do, HELP!!

      Yeah I have been going through some shit, I was going nuts because my bf was acting odd.  He says he isn't but he won't admit his weakness that he is stressed, frustrates me, I love the bastage and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him, if it works it does, if it doesn't well can't say we didn't try.  Well it's the fourth of July, and later on today I plan on going to the park with him hehe, and we are going to have a couple friends come down to the bbq we are having, then It's off to watch a fireworks show.

      Ok now because of Malik, I had to write a bit of an update while my beef is cooking (making homemade burritos, and enchaladas tonight).  I broke up with my bf, buttttt we are still talking, I just don't want to be with someone who is still into drugs, I myself got out of that a long time ago, and it just isn't emotionally stable at this time. He is a great guy and I am helping him with finding a meeting he can go to AA and NA.  Oh good gawd, I am also clumsy, I frickin broke a toe, possible 2, the other day : Long story short my pullout keyboard thingee to my desk broke, so i sit it on my lap and type (yes i know ghettofied), and it dropped right on my foot, i sat there for a couple minutes, didn't make a sound because of the pain I was in, needless to say here I am again typing and hoping it wont fall again lol ok now that is one toe down, now about the other one....I was moving a rocker/recliner, it was heavier than I thought and it dropped right on my big toe, my toes are all brusied up, looks nastee as fawk! lol  I dunno what else to say, I am starting school again next week *sigh* I am going to be 24 years old and I am still in school, oh the wonders of nursing :p hehe I am really not this negative, I know in the long run school and making people around me happy is why I can say everything is going to be alright. I think I get on some peoples nerves because when they come to me with their problems, I try to look on the brighter side of things, that isn't what people want all the time, yes encouragment is fine, but at the same time they want someone to listen, which I do, it's just I comment a bit too much after I listen :p hehe OK I am outtie for now, maybe later on Ill phone in another recording :p
