      all last week, i was having panic attacks about kim and bryan seemingly 24-7...sunday, i was forced to go to the circus...the whole car ride there, all i could think about was killing my self, i just wanted to throw myself out of the car and get crushed by a big truck or sumthin..it wasnt b/c of kim really, it was just everything in general...parents, friend, and kim i guess...and the car ride hoem, but for some reason, i couldnt pul the handle and i'm not sure why...but i got home and slept for a few hours, and i woke not having anxiety attacks or having horrible thoughts...this took me houurs to realize...and they didnt come back for a few days...     monday, i just had an amazing day(untill base ball)...it was just such a good day, ppl were complimenting me and braging to other ppl about my song, if u happen to be stalking me and i dont kno u, u can look at my xanga www.xanga.com/slicemebeautiful my song is there somewhere, its called battle scarred... to finsh off b/c i keep getting distracted...i still care about kim alot(things w/ bryan went to hell in a suit case)and liz has come out to tell me that she like me alot...i like her, but not as mucha s kim... o shit

      Ain't Love Grand Lyrics  Gutted like a pig, all you want is the world to bleed, someone somewhere stole your desire  The pain akin to, being punched in the throat, and stabbed in the chest  You would rather bleed than be without her  Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears  Replaced with lackluster memories you cry, your screams play in your empty room  It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your head  It's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrong  Your bed swallows you whole as the days bleed together, torment on the lips  Of a loved one, and if you try hard enough, you can almost taste her, feel her pass and  Scream, OH GOD WHY ME  --atreyu:aint love grand

      i have been having anxiety attacks since about 10:30 last night...it's rediculas...i kno exactly why too, bryan and kim...they are together now...she hasnt told me herself yet, but i kno they are...i have thought it since about monady night, i guess...she was acting differently, she was avoiding me(not avoiding me per say, but not really talking to me)...she ignores me on aim then gets angry when i dont talk for like a min...she wants to kno whats wrong, but i cant tell her...she says she still has feelings for me, but she says she needs to try and stop caring for me w/ someone else b/c shes never been able to move on...but shes sure it wont work once he learns all the shit that she goes through and all the shit that goes through her head...on sun, i spiiled my heart to her...and she just sat there and watched as i broke down...she did nothing, showed no emotion, and didnt even try to calm me down...last night i tried to talk to her b/c my mom had a stroke 6 months ago and she has been geting progressivly worse...she is losing function in her left side...and when i told kim this she just sat there and went "awww :-("...i kno there wasnt much to say to the fact that my mom may die at any given time, but still...i cut this moorning in the shower, its about the size of a quater...it bleed alot...and did for a while...but i have to go catch the bus...i will get back soon
