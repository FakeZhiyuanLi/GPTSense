        Hey! It's midori or as some of you may know Kaitlin though i haven't been called that in a long time lol. but today i was with katie and we waited at her gym because her gym instructor was late. then my mom picked me up and we went home. where my mom decided she needed to move her like five billion pound desk and i was to help. well i'm not very good at helping lol. and i learned that malls don't allow scavenger hunts which really sucks. O ya, lol i'm going camping again with emily which should be interesting considering that i'm well not the nature girl that emily is lol. O and i love gabe because he's so fine lol jkjkjk.  but really i LOVE the guy from my karate maybe one day i'll get the nerve to talk to him. i'm sad though cuz i don't have karate for a week. but maybe that way i can work on skateboarding lol and my golf big lol. and i can't wait until i go to la which is sometime this summer but my mom keeps changing her mind but i can't wait.  so HEY all my long lost friends in La. but really my mom is being evil and she won't let me get a mini ipod even though i have an excess amount of money and could safely buy my long coveted ipod but no she says i don't deserve it which is a load of CRAP. because i got a 3.75 gpa but no. grrrrrrr. but i shall not linger over my ever desiring need for an ipod. o and did i mention that my mp3 player BROKE and she still won't let me get it. anyways ya . well i love you all. hey like katie said i'm a bitch  cuz i said that but o well. aloha, ciao, aurvoir, avederziehn, adios and however else u want to say good-bye!

        Hey! well today i ran errands with my mom a fun filled eventful day. lol but anyways later i went to go see spiderman 2.And did u know that Tommy cummins' face structure is JUST like tobey mcguire's which is kind of creepy. well anyways this movie was the longest 2 hours and 7 minutes i think i have ever spent thinking about three things 1.)that i hate kirsten dunst with a passion 2.)that tobey mcguire looked just like tommy and 3.) when will this god damn movie be over! and in the midst of my thinking process i noticed that u can't drown a fusion substance. drowning it wouldnt' just make it go away ugh a stupid movie that is going to make a lot of money cuz the first one was good and made a lot of money too. so ya that's my opinion and if u didn't catch it through my very one sided fake review it SUCKED. lol.  luv ya , Midori/Kaitlin
