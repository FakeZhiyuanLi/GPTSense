						     Plagued corner of the universe     It's extremely irksome , yet poignant to have no cultural roots and heritage to be proud of.No one can blame the probabilty of micro cells dispersion across the continents,neither can one take it out on parents or grandparents who would think of their habitat as the entire globe. Although I can not neglect the profound effect of narcissism which influences people in different ways.As it happens,it seems that it is a good measure of development and a suitable mean to make distinction among nations and civilizations.The more it is intertwined and more pronounced in people's personalities,the closer to the stone age they dwell (vice versa).Having a look at what has been going on in Iraq, barberic attitudes showing up in the form of terror ,murder and fratriicide in Arab nations and the most under developed form of tyrany in Iran,leaves me alone with my shame . I see it as a misfortune to have been born and raised in THE omen part of the world,what they call Middle East.Albeit there is a whole lot of different quasi-cultures (I don't know of any other words to substitue "culture" for my purpose)embodied in humans who smear the richest region of the earth with their filthy soles. But,how can I cleanse myself and wash the vestiges and residues off ?How could I not see the years I spent(say squandered)in there?

						     Which came first?Egg or chicken?     Who knows ?Some say God has always been there and at some point and for some reasons(or may be for no reason) he decided to create human.This might be the most simplistic approach people have ever made. Even though nobody knows for sure ,I strongly believe,based on my own observations,that people created the God who presumably had created themselves. We all tend to make imaginary concepts and get them divine identities to fill up our voids.And this originates from our weakness . Once God was created by people,other ramifactions began to show up.Religions,after life,prophetes,...to name a few. The smart ones took advantage of people's stupidity and came up with holy books and rituals and claimed to have been in contact with the very same invented God in order to guide others through the dark ,bumpy and scary road of life. They built up temples and began to garnish people's assets through friendly ,well tailored avenues,stablish monarchy and enter sovereignty. Those of less wisdom and mental abilitiy,started to revere their PROPHETES and follow them blindly .Disasters turned out to be related to their unfair deeds or disobedience .Blind born child was thought of as the result of not conducting the prayer.If one was not able to attain his right ,there was an after life ,in which he could appeal ,and this mentality paved the way for strong to oppress the weak. In retrospect,people invented things which made them miserable.
