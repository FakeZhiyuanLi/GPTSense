      This Is Me       My name is Monica. I'm 14 years old. My birthday is June 4th. I am in a family of 4, with 3 animals. My mom, Marcia. My dad, Jesse. My brother, Wes. My dog (Golden Retriever), Maverick. My other dog (Yellow Lab), Goose. And my guinea pig, Duke.       I live in a small town. I don't think the population has ever gotten up to 400. There are no stop lights. And the nearest mall is 45 minutes away. The nearest K-Mart is 30 minutes away. Don't get me wrong, this is a great town to grow up in. When your a kid, it's great, but once you start realizing what you want to do in life, it's not always the greatest thing...how many celebrities do you know that have come from a small town w/ a population of 350? I don't know of many.        Any who, I do have a big time goal like that, to get out of this crap state and move to North Carolina. Durham, North Carolina to be exact. What's in Durham, North Carolina? ...The Duke Blue Devils. Duke University to get more into depth. Duke University has been my favorite college since the begining of 6th grade. I'm not sure what exactly drew me to the Duke Blue Devils, maybe it was the colors (Blue & White), maybe it was the hott guys..who knows. I just love it. And getting out of state would be a dream come true for me. So I'm addicted to The Duke Blue Devils..hence my guinea pig's name, Duke. Speaking of Duke...(my guinea pig.) Duke is a girl. She just turned a year old. Her middle name is, Syracuse. Duke Syracuse. Because I also like Syracuse. I just love the color orange. And yes, they have hott guys there too. I just like Duke a lot more..       I guess by after reading all that you can pretty much assume how much I love basketball...well your right. Only I love it 10 X more than you think. Honestly. Basketball means the world to me, if it weren't for my love of basketball I prolly wouldn't be here, it was a tough first 2 years in middle school, that's when I addapted basketball as my new found love. I had always played the sport, thanks to my big brother, Wes. I just then had picked it up as my love. Speaking of Wes and basketball...Wes was the one who really got me started playing. I can remember not wanting to play cause it was too hard, but Wes wouldn't let me go in the house until I shot a basket. At this time I was maybe 5/6... He did that everyday. Then evenutally he wouldn't let me go inside without making a basket. Then later on, I'd just go outside and play by myself or when he'd have friends over, they'd go outside and play basketball and I'd watch. So thank you to Wes, I now have a love beyond immagination for basketball that will never end.       Your prolly wondering when all this is going to end, well  I'm sorry, I just have so much to tell since when I was growing up, I never had anyone to tell anything to. I didn't really have a best friend, and the friends I did concider best friends told someone every little secret I told them, so that didn't work out. Don't get this mixed up though, I do have a best friend, her name is Raven. Raven lives 4 hours away from me though. Her mom & dad split up when we were about 4. We lived pretty close too. ...I had just moved into town and I was going to preschool and my brother came home one day, asked my Mum if he could go to his new friend's house he had met at school. So later he went over to this kids house and then the next day this kid came over and I learned his name, Kurtis. Come to find out, Kurtis and Wes were born on the same day, same year, same month, everything. Just Wes is 20 hours older than Kurt. Any who..Kurtis and Wes kept hanging out and one day, Wes told my Mum about Kurtis' family and it turns out Kurt had a sister my age..so my Mum and Kurt's Mum (Margret) were talking on the phone as soon as you would know it and they soon were hanging out like Wes and Kurt. When Margret came over she would bring her daughter, the one about my age (the only daughter she had) and we played, we didn't really get along, I was a snot. But obviously the little girl about my age was Raven, my best friend. Raven still comes to visit her dad, Gary, in my home town, but it's not the same, cause it's like Gary and I are fighting for time to hang out w/ her, cause we both never get to see her. So I rarley get to see her and when I do, we both have no idea what we're talking about b/c she doesn't know what's going on at my school, in my life, all the drama. And vise versa. Any who, I still love her, she's awesome and so much fun. We've had some crazy times..        ..Wild things, eh?

           As a freshmen, I have a chance to be on the varsity girls basketball team. But I'm not sure if I really want to. I have made a list of pros and cons, here they are:  Pros: -I'd get to show off to people       -My dad would be proud       -I am mentally ready for varsity players       -I am physically ready for varsity players  Cons: -Not enough playing time for me personally       -I wouldn't be able to 'lead' (which is the only think I know how to do)       -1 girl on the team & I would NOT be able to play together right  Hmm, so you tell me, what do you think -- varsity or jv?
