      Well it's the start of my 3 day vacation and I'm nearly off on my way to Detroit. Nonstop flight, something like 3 hours. That's barely anything at all. My dad insists on dropping me off at my Aunt's house, and she's going to give my grandmother and me a ride to the airport. I don't get no autonomy. Sigh.  Aw nuts, I forgot to set the OOO on my phone at work! Well at least I can use the Outlook web client to set it there.

      Aero replaces Luna in Longhorn. Does anyone even remember the name "Luna" anymore? As fond as Microsoft is of code names the marketing division works hard to bury them once a project is in production. Anyways here are some sexy screenshots of Aero  urlLink rifling through windows like Expose  and showing  urlLink  windows in the 3rd dimension  like Sun's Looking Glass. It's enough to make me doubt my support for M$ with respect to innovation. At least I can still take refuge in the knowledge that what Windows doesn't do first it does  right . What we  urlLink forget about the "worse is better" argument  is that sometimes it just takes a process of iterative refinement to get from worse to better.

      I am  so  guilty of this that it hurts to read Hani's post. Is my head really in the sky? Do I look down on everyone else at work?  So look around, do you consider yourself in the smart minority in your team? Do you think it's a matter of time before everyone else realises your genius and adopts your ways? If the answer is yes, then it's time to get up, slowly pull the thumb out of your anus, and casually let go of the nearest guy's penis, and perhaps, with truly open eyes, look around.  But every programmer thinks himself a genius, right? And even if I dissuade myself of any delusions of grandeur, the ancient architecture of our system at work is an incontrovertible fact.   I'm thankful for the hadith mentioned by my sister.

      Here's the  urlLink really slick mobile phone  that OZ says he can get me free with just a single year of service. It's got a camera, support for XHTML-MP (i.e. WAP 2.0), and a MIDP 2.0 environment (so it can run Jabberwocky!). I wonder if it also supports WML 1.x with the older WAP protocol? Here's the  urlLink Sony Ericsson T610 WURFL  profile and the  urlLink Sony Ericsson T610 UAProf .  urlLink Tao of Mac  is panning the device saying the  urlLink T610 doesn't support XHTML . He's got quite a few other digs at it, it's worth reading before thinking of getting this phone. I wonder what the nicest alternatives are nowadays? I'm so illiterate when it comes to actually  using  mobile phones. I want something I can use to code on, with good support for organizer and social-type apps.  More links:     urlLink Review pointed at by Slick Deals

      I just came home from our masjid school graduation ceremony. The mosque I go to is ISGH South Zone in Stafford, located close to Dulles and highway 90A, and shared by residents of Sugar Land, Missouri City, and Stafford.  I was sort of the A/V guy for today, setting up for the junior/senior class's video presentation on the battle of Uhud, and for the photo slideshow of the school's first annual picnic.  This morning, at the last minute, I discovered that the video was on VHS, not on a CD or DVD. Damn, I thought, how could we possibly watch that? All the kids erupted in chaos for a little while, while I set up the projector right in the middle of the ceremony and Br. M covered for me. We used the same TV/VCR combo they use to show the little kids Adam's World, but the RCA jacks on it were (I suspect) input-only so we couldn't hook it up to the projector or to any speakers. And I had worked so hard too, jumping into my car and driving all the way home and back to get that A/V cable! What I should have done was grab our VCR as well. Bummer. The video was okay I think, just a bit to irreverent for something you're going to show to Uncles and Aunties (and actually I think that perhaps someone from our admittedly fundamentalist generation might be more offended).  It wasn't until the slideshow that we discovered that the hall was just too bright to use the projector anyways. That and we were running behind, so they told me to cut the show down to 5 minutes. Or less. And they told me to do a running commentary. I had figured the slideshow would work like the one during MIST where the kids and whooped and cheered for every photo, especially whenever they saw a friend (or, often, a foe). So I rather lamely stepped through some of the intro pictures to the picnic for a while with some non-relevant commentary about food and cricket, and mentioning the names of a few of the people. Then I promised to stick the photos up on the SZ web site tonight. I better get cracking on that.  During the trophy ceremony I found out that I should probably have passed out 1st/2nd/3rd trophies like all the other teachers. The kids in my class sorta got mad at me for that. It wouldn't have made a difference if you ask me, after all it would have been the exact same people as in R's class.  By zuhr time I was just sort of sick and tired of being surrounded by all these people that I wanted to go home, but they had pizza on sale for lunch so I stuck around for that. Then I came home and passed out on the couch. Damn! I was going to go and show A how to change the oil in his Echo. Well I had to call up and apologize, now I'm gonna do it tomorrow after work. This is going to be fun: I feel so grown up, teaching someone how to change the oil in his car and all. And I swear I'm not going to do it in a control freak way like my dad did.  Now my plan for the rest of today is to tidy up the room to free up some brainspace and then work on building a prototype for work showing how we can serve out a WML, Voice XML, and regular XHTML interface out of the same database. The main question right now is whether or not I use XSLT to do it...

       The "I Power Blogger" campaign is a cool idea. Out of curiosity, who thought it up?  Minor bug with the standard templates: the alt text still says "Powered by Blogger" instead of "I Power Blogger". So many people are missing out on your clever new slogan!  -- Fahd I just sent this to Blogger via their support page. I think that I should have marked it as a bug rather than a wish list item. They're probably swamped right now dealing with issues caused by the re-launch and won't touch it, even if it is a 2-minute fix.  Thanks for submitting your Wish List item. We greatly value feedback from our users and review every submission.  I wonder if they'd even care to fix this? "Powered by" is still the standard after all, and will live on past the current campaign.

      It just struck me how devilishly clever the "I Power Blogger" campaign is. Thousands of pages reference that image on the Blogger.com servers, if only because they're using a tweaked version of a standard theme. Hundreds of thousands of readers worldwide will notice the change in color and click. What better way to spread word around about the Blogger relaunch?   Come to think of it, that's how  I  first came to know about the relaunch myself! It's even more fiendish than I had imagined! I hadn't even realized it until after writing that last bit.

      I keep telling myself I'm going to un-subscribe from Boing Boing because they post just way too much stuff. Just the fact that I'm using newsreader in the first place is already information overload enough for me! With Boing Boing and Scoble on the list how the hell am I supposed to have time for anything? I really have to develop some information filtering skills. If only there was a Reader's Digest condensed version of Scoble's blog.   (Haha! The turban'd-Sikh-terrorist-lookalike issue just made a cameo on Saturday Night Live!)   Here's an idea for a  sosowa  urlLink *  service: generate an RSS/Atom/plaintext news feed composed by aggregating a list of other feeds, BUT give an editor community the opportunity to single-click remove posts. The goal would not be to censor the posts but to create a condensed version by filtering out the stuff not related to the topic.  RSS when used for blogging is effectively an opt-in version of Usenet newsgroups. Just look at where the most advanced news readers are going: they give you a newsgroups/message board view of the feeds you're watching. True, you can also see all the posts by an individual in chronological order, but that's almost a byproduct as far as the blogging community is interested. Why does opt-in make a difference? It makes you largely immune to the annoyance of the low SNR of most newsgroups, and ensures that you keep reading  quality  content by authors you  care  about.  Okay, that's probably the only post I'll ever write on the blogging community. I rather want to avoid becoming a part of the talk-radio of the Internet.   (Hold on... Jimmy Fallon is reviewing Troy on the fake news... hey it's his last night on SNL tonight)   Okay now down to what this point was supposed to be about: the HHGTTG movie is still on! The  urlLink production team just started a blog . No way to subscribe as of yet - no Atom, no RSS. The occasional gem of news such as this is exactly what I continue to subscribe to Boing Boing for.  They've got a video of Marvin up. He looks rather like a short little big-headed storm trooper from Star Wars (the original round helmets, not the ones that the clones wear in episode 2). It disturbs me a little that there's a  little person  in there. I've never felt right that there's a guild of little actors. On the other hand, the whole point of it is to prevent them from being taken advantage of. It's just that it  always  seems to me that they're being taken advantage of. I wonder if they're cashing in?   (I just saw an ad on TV for a new reality show called "Next Action Star" where folks compete at doing stunts for a chance to be a stuntman in a real movie. That's perhaps the first reality show that actually sounds interesting to me.)   ---   *  This appears to be an  urlLink abbreviation for "social software" . I found it via an article about the  urlLink requirements of social software on Drupal . I was investigating alternatives to Blogger where I would keep ownership of my content. Not planning to actually use it anytime soon... just want to have alternatives available and play around with once I get a Linux installation going.

      I was just reading an  urlLink article about Jabberwocky  on TheFeature. It's a piece of software that runs on your cell phone or PDA and uses Bluetooth to identify your  urlLink familiar strangers . Basically it just looks for other Bluetooth devices that are broadcasting their IDs and records them, and provides a display that lets you look at just how often and where you keep meeting these people/devices again and again. What's the range of Bluetooth? The official web site promises that the  urlLink range of Bluetooth  is 10 meters but the Bluetooth SIG has always been overly optimistic about what it can and/or will do. That's enough to scan cars next to you on the road, especially in a traffic jam. I've often wondered what cars I commonly share the road with. This is almost by itself major impetus to get a cell phone.  I wonder how the privacy groups and EFF and whatnot will take this? Any sort of unique ID on a user is anathema to them. There could be some very sinister applications of this idea. Imagine writing a virus (well... trojan more likely) in Java to monitor someone's movements. It would infect as many phones as possible, and whenever it locates the target sends a message back to the originator. Okay, so that's far-fetched. But I'm sure there's some way that this could be very very bad. Jabberwocky is open sourced and written using J2ME for MIDP 2.0, I could download it and see how to do the Bluetooth stuff and try to write an app myself based on such an idea.  PBS has a re-run of Austin City Limits with Nickel Creek on today. They're a sort of bluegrass-influenced band. Insanely cool - I first heard of them on Prairie Home Companion. I think the guy plays a yukalalee (a Google search confirms that I spelled that right - weird huh?). But it could equally well be a banjo, the same search mentioned that a yukalalee is either a type of banjo or vice versa. You know, it would probably have been smarter to Google for "Nickle Creek" than "yukalalee"... I suppose with near infinite information at your fingertips urlLink *  you have to draw the line somewhere though (re: how much detail you're willing to drill down into).  Another thought: I need to find an email client supporting IMAP that I can live with. I currently use Outlook 2000 but I can't stand it because the IMAP support is single-threaded! I'm not kidding, just trying to open up a message locks the application! This is utterly intolerable because at home I'm still on dialup.  I so need to get broadband. Dialup seriously limits my ability to read articles and generally muck about listlessy online. It's also one of the things that went seriously wrong with the masjid school finances.  Hey! I swear the zoom in on Darrel Hammond's face as he said "it's saturday night!" was done with a digital zoom! You could see the image pixelate slightly. The Olsen twins aren't a very good host. SNL brings in the cast members to aid in the monologue when they know the host/s can't handle a live audience themselves.   *  A reference to the birth of COM and  urlLink MS's vision of distributed computing . I don't think they ever effectively differentiated it from Sun's vision of network-centric computing. Except that it's MS software and 3rd-party hardware instead of being Sun software  and  Sun hardware - that definitely makes me favor MS's view, my Linux fandom aside. Anyways one can be both a Linux fan as well as a Microsoft fan, especially since I'm not a UNIX fan. Die, commercial UNIX, die!

      Some of our family friends are moving to Dubai so we've invited them over for dinner tonight. No young males in either family, so here I am sitting in my room dicking around on the computer.  Iron Monkey  is now 2 weeks overdue. 9 bucks down the drain, but it's a good movie. It's a bit  ajeeb  that 2 unrelated families are both moving overseas to Dubai at the same time. I wonder if there's some sort of major projects going on there, like the business generated by the Iraq situation?  The interesting bit of news is this: I have it on the authority of an  Uncle  that the main bottleneck in oil production is refining capacity. So at a time with sky-high oil prices such as now, with  regular  unleaded gasoline at  $1.85/gal  here, why are all the engineering companies sitting on their hands all bummed out because the only ones making any money are the contracters in Iraq? Well building refineries is  expensive , takes 15-20  years  to plan out and do right, and anyways the legal restrictions make it very difficult to do (refining oil is a dirty dirty process and communities worldwide rally against having a refinery nearby). No one is willing to invest. It's like Z was explaining the other day about regulation and the requirement of massive up-front capital forming a high barrier to entry. This must be why oil is watched through the price of crude, i.e. pre-refinery product. But the OPEC countries are currently operating at maximum capacity according to NPR so it doesn't look like that number is coming down any time soon either.

      This happened a while ago (the 1st of this month), but it's finally starting to sink in - I've finally started to realize that I still think of Yanbu as home. I'm going to collect some articles on this and see if I can draw some sort of conclusion from it.  ABB was attacked and several expats were killed. One was a white British convert to Islam, Mike Hardy.  Inna lillahi wa inna ilahi raji'un.  The killers were security guards at the firm.   urlLink Guardian Unlimited :   Attackers sprayed gunfire inside an oil contractor's office Saturday, killing six Westerners - including two Americans - and wounding 25 people before leading police on a bloody chase with the naked body of one victim tied to their car.   Police pursued the attackers through the industrial city of Yang and fought them in a shootout outside the Holiday Inn, finally overpowering them on a downtown street, witnesses said.      YIS  was hit with a pipe bomb. I wonder if perhaps just maybe it was a student with a grudge? That's probably wishful thinking.  My family and I lived in Yanbu for many years. It's on the west coast, by the Red Sea. Before the refinery industry caught on there it was a worldwide attraction for scuba diving and snorkeling - the reef is so far out that you can go out for a mile in water no more than 10 feet deep. YIS was the school I went to for 8th and 9th grades.    In another, near-simultaneous attack in the city, a pipe bomb was thrown over a wall of Yanbu International School, causing minor damage and slightly injuring the school's custodian, according to the Overseas Security Advisory Council, which shares security information between the U.S. government and the private sector.   Staff and children had already been advised not to report to school that morning, the U.S. Embassy's Web site said.     Breaking news: http://www.arabnews.com/?article=44186 http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-4043373,00.html  Analysis and results: http://www.arabnews.com/?article=44535 http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/newsletter2004/saudi-relations-interest-05-01.html http://news.bostonherald.com/international/view.bg?articleid=19043 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3708421.stm

      The last time I heard about  urlLink jumping beans  was probably back in 3rd grade. This is a fun site because it's so targetted at children and their parents. Not too young though:   WARNING - CHOKING HAZARD  - jumping beans are not intended for children under 4.  I can't believe they can live (and continue rocking) for up to 2-3 months. These are of course the product of some sort of moth larvae growing (and doing aerobic exercises apparently) inside of seed cases, and also the product of one cool entrepreneur story.  Another fate remains for jumping bean capsules that harbor the moth larvae, particularly if they happen to be in the vicinity of Alamos, Mexico. This is the land of the jumping bean and the home of Senor Joaquin Hernandez, the legendary "king of the jumping beans." When he was only twelve years old, Joaquin saw the potential for marketing jumping beans and started a thriving industry that has persisted for more than 60 years. People from the community are paid for all the beans they can deliver to Joaquin's business in Alamos. During favorable seasons, Joaquin employs 50 people for selecting and packing the beans, and in some years he exports 20 million beans.  What I think is interested is to imagine what the look on a kid's face must be when he smashes a seed open and a disgusting bit of slimy worm-like larvae comes oozing out!

      There's some major thunderstorm action going down here today. I just looked out the window at work, and with the lights on and business going on as usual indoors, it's creepy to peer out into the darkness. But that's not the really queer part: there is no wind. The trees near our building all stand alone and apart from each other, and right now they rather look like lone sentries standing at watch, evenly spaced against the darkness, their evergreen tops the pointed hoods of raincoats. Despite the chatter of activity within and the roar of rain and thunder without, you look out and all you can think of is silence.

Japan is not the only country in Asia to make some funky canned coffees. Mr Brown Coffee started out as a Taiwanese Starbucks knock off but evolved into it own thing eventually. Run by the  urlLink King Car Food Company  in Taiwan Mr Brown coffee comes in a larger can than the 6.25.oz BOSS coffee.  They have the coolest looking logo of all time!  MR BROWN IS YOUR NEW GOD!  I love the cheesy stereotype European guy with his all white Italian suit and the thumbs up smile. Who needs Buddy Christ when there is Mr Brown? Make all the Reservoir Dogs jokes you can.  It's no frappucino, but it's good stuff. Bit of an after-taste. Most of the can seems to be tin or iron, though the top is the usual aluminum pull-tab on any soft drink. It's sort of weird looking smaller (8.12 fl. oz. that's.a.lot.of.dots) can. The drink has some fans online, and seems to be  urlLink internationally available  giving me my first real chance to use Google translations, yay! That's the only reason I'm writing this at all really ;-)  So much of Sugar Land is asian ( urlLink 23.8% !) that this entire side of Houston is filled with Chinese and Vietnamese import shops. Some of those imports are now creeping into the mainstream stores.   Update: after like 2 years of using Blogger I think I'm finally starting to get a hang of how to format blockquotes and pre's while also dropping the &lt;br/>'s in automatically...    Another update... it's later tonight and my stomach is starting to feel a little queasy... I think it might have been the Mr. Brown... more on this as it develops, I have another can in the fridge at work but it was too good to toss... we'll see how it goes.

      Seriously what the hell is  urlLink this ? I don't want my mp3 player shooting  urlLink live current through my body .

The  urlLink firewall support  page for RealPlayer lists the ports used but I'm not sure which to forward. Also, does forwarding a port automatically mean that it's unblocked? By default, the Player uses the following ports to connect.   TCP 80, 554, 4040, 7070, 8080, 443 (SSL for sign-in), 1755 (MMS Windows Media requests)  UDP 6970-32,000, 1755 (MMS Windows Media resend requests)  HTTP 80 (AU, Messaging Service, and HTTP Cloaking)  For now I'm forcing the player to use HTTP only though the support warns that it degrades quality, clearly the UDP based transport has reduced overhead, and perhaps the naked TCP one as well. To configure your player this way go to Tools|Preferences... then pick off Connection/Network Transports and uncheck all transports other than HTTP in both the RTSP and PNA subdialogs.  Via Lambda and CGN, a  urlLink horribly abstract taxonomy  of meta-programming systems (generators of and analysis tools for computer programs).

That annoys me slightly as a Python programmer, though I know it's only in there as the slightest of nods to us in the first place. Most source code generators I've seen in Python tend to be type illiterate though because they depend on textual code templates. When it comes to heterogeneous analysis latter-day tools such as most open source interpreters or Java or the .NET family have a great advantage because their runtimes invariably include at least the front-end of the compiler right in the standard library. By front-end I mean parsing and syntax analysis. That prevents problems like we have at work parsing Delphi (I resorted to cheap regex tactics).  Expect a  urlLink terrorist attack in Macedonia  soon. A real one. It won't be long until someone tries to avenge what took place there. Self-fulfilling prophecies are one of the great ironies of life. This saddens me greatly, Macedonia was supposed to be the multi-ethnic role model for the former Yugoslavian nation-states.  Suprnova just posted a  urlLink torrent for R&G are Dead !

      The  urlLink last 3 books  of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy are going to make on to BBC Radio 4! Apparently Douglas planned this long before his death, selecting a director, preparing instructions, and in fact even recorded himself as  urlLink Agrajag . Each book is going to be a new series. The first episode of  Life, The Universe, And Everything  aired today! The audio's not available online just yet but it will be very soon. Now this I've absolutely got to grab via Total Recorder just so that I can distribute it to all the HHG fans I know.   Update: let me just throw in a link to the  urlLink production company doing the new Hitchhiker's series  and note that  Life, the Universe, and Everything  won't actually be getting broadcast until the 21st of September this year.

      An excellent business opportunity: build a BitTorrent client that handles firewalls decently (perhaps via a proxy that opens up ports so that it doesn't have to) and can be easily  branded  by a downloads site into a "download client" that automatically loads out of a web browser (probably via Java). There's really no reason for an end user to know they're using BT at all.

      I'm sitting here and reviewing all the wild claims I made on the self-evaluation form I turned in to my manager a while back at work. My end of year review is tomorrow. Among other things my raise depends on that - not that a raise based on any realistic percentage of my meager salary will be very much. Our fiscal year ends in July. It probably has something to do with the fact that we're based in Ireland.  I just rediscovered  urlLink the bastard  thanks to ever so slick xml syndication technology! The Register has an RSS feed bringing  urlLink bastards aplenty  to my reader. BOFH is funny because it revels in the anti-user attitude that you can never indulge in in real life.  BBC has virtual coverage of the  urlLink Euro 2004  soccer tournament via some sort of Shockwave based video-game-ish replay tool. I can't wait for when they'll be able to manage this in realtime. It would be absolutely incredible if you could go on to Xbox Live and spectate on a Madden 2004 game mirroring a real world game on some delay, allowing access to all the flying cameras and replays and views that such games usually include.  It's the first time I've had reason to install Shockwave on my laptop. I always figured that it was another Macromedia plugin like Flash, but I guess it wouldn't make sense for them to to try and manage 2 very similar and hard to differentiate brands. Shockwave seems to be  urlLink more specialized for 3D stuff .  Skype  urlLink combines P2P and VOIP , and they just released a Linux client today. I keep hearing this  disruptive technology  phrase all over the place these days. These are the guys that put Kazaa together. It sounds like they use feedback from the decentralized network to figure out what the best way to route packets is and the edge nodes connect to the super-nodes rather than vice-versa so that it bypasses firewall issues.

      Spiders are beautiful.  I was just out in the yard where a small golden one with a striped round abdomen has seen fit to construct a web restricting access to the garage door. I am quite certain that it wasn't there this afternoon, and as I knelt to examine the precious workmanship I noticed that he was indeed putting the final touches on the web just then.  It appears that the outbound rays come first, with a thick reinforced knot at the focus for strength. Then the spider circles wide and inward to create the rungs. He either ate or otherwise destroyed the white ball of webbing in the center to create a little hole in the final web in which to sit, a finger on each of the outbound rays awaiting prey in much the manner of a shopkeeper with a bell on the door.  His reflexes test out to be quite honed as well: with just a gentle puff of air I could get him to face in any direction, and occasionally run over to an edge to see what was going on. I got to see him catch a mosquito. They really do roll their catch as they wrap it, just like Shelob in The Two Towers movie.  Keep in mind though that the hadith about being kind to spiders is nothing but a common and baseless desi myth (though as always, allah hu alim).

      The Crescent Youth played paintball today. It was basically my first time, though I've meddled before. About 16 out of the 150 or so invited people showed up. I want to write down my experiences before this experience is lost to me, like so many great moments in the past I have only vague memories of today. I don't trust my own mind with this sort of stuff.  We had rentals (guns, 700 count ammo*, and face masks, a padded vest if you begged) and with all us guys together the price was $30, up from the $25 they told us when originally we figured we'd have 30-40 people there. The guns held 200 balls in a clip, though you had to be careful because the hopper kept on falling off. We drove a long way from Sugar Land all the way down near the SE zone masjid (Sheikh Z.'s place) because we expected all of the SE brothers to join but none of them showed up. They've got lots of great spots near to them, they must play all the time.  * green balls with purple paint  We played 2 games on the lego-tower scenario, 2 on the pipes, and 2 CTF out in the 3-way swastika shaped maze. Then we went out and had lunch at Mc Donald's and prayed dhuhr together at Sheikh Z's. Pumped up with fries, that nasty orange drink, and salaat we returned to the field. The ref was nice enough to watch our stuff. We still had 2 hoppers left for most of us. That's when the real fun started. 3 incredible games in the barrels (I love the barrels - so reminiscient of the thousands of video games and movies that make up my childhood memories). Then back to the pipes for a couple of kick-ass games of Quake 3 style CTF where once you get out you can run back to the entry gate and beg the ref to let you back in (basically you respawn at your home base). The ref lets folks in one at a time spacing them out a bit to prevent mad rushes.  Up until then we had our team of 8 split up into pairs. I was with S., the guy with the graphics arts business and the leader of Crescent Youth. That first game though I wanted to take advantage of the re-entry rule and do one crazy suicide run right through the middle all the way to the flag. Total offense, cross-fire be damned, no fear, and all guts. I made it all the way to the last bunker before I got punked. The ref slapped hands with me as I walked back to the gate. That was a good run. But I had another run in me.  The second time I stayed at one of the back bunkers. I'd just been shot in the goggles so my vision was very poor. Not being very effective at shooting from way back there near the gate, I ran towards the front, one bunker at a time. Before long I realized that with everyone busy in their own bunkers, each paired up with someone who was shooting at them, no one was looking at the big picture. The flag was 2 bunkers ahead of me. I ran without looking anywhere, just focusing on speed, and slid in behind the last bunker. At that point it was just a basic football drill to jump out, grab the flag, spin a 180 and get back behind the bunker.  Now to get that flag back to our gate. That was supposed to be the hard part. I waited in my bunker for a bit because it seemed pretty safe at the time. I heard the ref shout, "Where's the flag? Where's the flag?" and I waved it about for the benefit of my teammates. They laid down some covering fire and I ran back through the middle again, a hole between the 2 main walls of barrels. The whole time I was sure I'd get hit in the back but really didn't care, the flag was on our side and in this game the other team wasn't allowed to pick up their own flag *ever*. But I made the run and reached the gate and let out some whoops. When the refs examined me it looked like I might have gotten hit in the back but the paint was dry and they let it go. The victory was pretty decisive. Even if they made me plant the flag back down it would have been on our own side of the main bunkers and we held the entire center of the field. The other team had crawled along the (short) side walls and was firing inward, a strategy we tried the second time around.  After that we mostly just wanted to fire off the rest of our ammo and go home, so the ref recommended we play terminator (a game that lasts till every last person is out of shot) and we chose to play at the fortress. I've always wanted to see what goes on inside a cramped little shack when you're defending yourself and everyone outside is closing in, so I played defense. It was a terrible idea. My gun froze. It hadn't really worked since the last re-insertion game we played and after juicing up the CO2 cartridge I'd convinced myself that it would work, but when the paint started flying I was helpless. We were slaughtered. They were coming and several of us had problems, either our equipment seized or we had a jam or we ran out of paintballs. I have some serious bruises from that experience. Someone just walked up, stuck their head in through the window, and let loose.  And the final results of the day: our team probably won 4 or 5 out of 12 games, and I have some serious bruises. The entire upper half of my body has the little welts, but the forearm of my gun arm is swollen out of shape. Not only did I get several bad hits on it as I stuck my head around corners but I also crawled on it in the dirt afterwards. I feel much better now after a looong shower though.  The paintball league jerseys are cool. I want one, even if I'll be a total poser wearing it.

      I was at the gym yesterday and for the first time in my life it really struck me just how poisonous music is. I was running on the treadmill and mulling over some issues about work and this one consulting project, and suddenly  When I Come Around  by Green Day came on. I really love that song. Rock is something you enjoy vicariously; you picture yourself in place of the musician/vocalist. It's an axe on serious thought. I've mostly quit listening to pop and rock type music, though I do pull out my favorites every once in a while. I took the advice of one alim and switched to "safer" music - art music like on classical or eclectic radio stations - as a way of easing me down off of music.  Don't laugh, but the gym I go to is Bally Total Fitness on 59S exit 90A. Yeah it really is more of a gym for women, the high aerobics to weights ratio makes that clear. There's no pool, no track, not much in the way of hot water, and I signed a 3 year contract last July. Oh yes, I have an excuse: I can walk to Bally from work in about 3 minutes. Now when I'm having a bad or particularly tedious day (and yes just about every day is tedious here) I can take lunch off and go run 3 miles on a treadmill or lift some weights to tighten my muscles and keep me in my chair, but in reality I haven't really been taking advantage of this benefit.  I spent over 2 hours working out yesterday because I was procrastinating work on a data-driven IVR prototype system I'm putting together in an attempt to get the developers at work to notice the modern software engineering principles that exist. Like perhaps they'll actually acknowledge the existence of OOP and  OOAD  at last. This is one thing I truly cannot afford to procrastinate on though; today I overheard Z. talking to some developers and more importantly the VP about his own data-driven system. I can't let him put his design into use. I can't work on software that works the way these people would build it.  After my looong workout I went to the mosque for the aqeeqah of this nice Nigerian brother's son (or daughter). His wife was sick and stayed at home with the kids, so I never got to meet them. This brother works on an oil rig somewhere in Africa as an engineer of some sort. He's often gone for stints of several months at a time, working along side just a few comrades out of sight of any land whatsoever.  I met B., this arab brother at the masjid last night and guessed that he was Syrian right off the back because he could easily be Abdul H.'s brother. Perhaps Abdul H. himself if he grew a beard, rode a Harley, and worked as a construction contractor. The funny thing is this guy thought I was Jordanian (probably why he caught my attention and said salaam as I was about to leave). I remember looking vaguely Mexican in high school and folks thinking I was Punjabi because of the eyes, but this was new. A bit disturbing perhaps, aren't Jordanian men supposed to look evil? Yeah that's really bad to say, but I recall Abdul H. mentioning that as a stereotype. He does great impressions of arabs from different countries. He's really funny when he does "the young pretty Syrian girl". Apparently Syrian arabic is really deep and heavy and very un-ladylike.  New approach to managing my time at work: a  self-enforced  5 minute break every 1/2 hour. Surely spending 1/6 of my time on break will kill my productivity? No, sadly I think I waste more time currently, daydreaming and being aimlessly perfectionist-ic. And I think going to bed at 11:00pm every day will help as well.  The absence line at work is 555-4901 urlLink * . I think I'm going to call in sick on Wednesday to go to the Microsoft Security Summit. Yeah I could have very easily legitimately taken that day off as training, but I never filled out the paperwork or talked to the right people. Somehow this links in with "it is easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission" but I'm not sure exactly how it would apply.  MSS should be pretty lame and humdrum. I mean, it's not  supposed  to be an exciting event, is it? I don't want to check Feedster for others' opinions till after MSS and I've written about my own reactions.   *  Yeah, like I'm going to post a confidential number online. But I needed to write down those last 4 digits somewhere I can check Tuesday night.

      I drove all the way to the gym tonight only to note once I was in the dressing rooms with my pants down that my shorts weren't in my bag. Oops. Enough of an excuse to skip PT for the night and go for a drive instead. Basically this is my excuse for why I listened in on the disgusting self-congratulatory spectacle that was on tonight.  KUHF wasn't covering the DNC national convention but both Pacifica and AM talk radio were. I love talk radio when I have the patience to listen to it (it can be hard for a conservative Muslim to listen to the radio these days,  urlLink respectable conservatism is so passe ) but the ads bored into my skull after a little while and the commentary was less than intelligent so I switched over. Is that  it ? Is that alone the one thing that prevents liberals from gaining the cachet of talk radio? There are no ads on Pacifica. Thier business model is against it. There's little to no local support from businesses. Financing may be what will forever prevent serious liberal radio from taking off (well, other than general idiocy and the outright flakiness of the left).  Clinton was genuinely funny tonight as the main speaker, despite one slip of the tongue worthy of Dubya himself: " the terrorists are well-armed and well-dangerous... well-armed and more dangerous ". Conservative Freud-ists can have fun with that one. His best joke (and not one very well thought out, though he stuck with it for a while) was his claim that now that he's joined the top 1% richest in the country he's suddenly a part of the Republican base, and the tax cut was for him. He's probably the #1 topic online tonight. Blogs are the  urlLink talk radio of the internet .   Update: looks like Kerry is quite prone to this... during his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination on Thursday night he claimed that he'd "double the size of the special forces in order to increase terrorist operations". At last, a presidential nominee that  really  understands the meaning of American military power!

      It's pretty miserable to spend Sunday night at work but quite honestly I had nothing better to do and things are looking&nbsp;pretty desperate schedule-wise for this week. All I was going to do this evening was watch some TV, browse the web, and perhaps code a little on  VisioDiff  (more to come on that one I promise, it's really slick) so basically there was no excuse. It's a matter of duty: there was work to be done; I've got to do it. Working till midnight on a Sunday is a different thing entirely when you bring your personal laptop along and there's no one else at the office. I had  Shrek 2  and  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  to keep me company. Since I watched both in the theaters I had no qualms about fetching them via a torrent. I'll post some thoughts on those movies in a while, but for now just a couple of observations: 1) Ron doesn't move his arms when he runs, and 2) it would have saved Harry and Hermione a lot of work if they'd just freed Buckbeak the first time around, when they first left Hagrid's hut, rather than take the back-asswards approach via the Time-Turner. But that's just the benefit of hindsight, or of the spectator. Anyways even with the extra work this evening there's plenty of hell to go through up ahead because I simply committed to more than I have time for. Between me and the guy I'm paired with we have projects from Amgen,  BMS ,  OMRI , Merck, Merck, and more Merck all in one week. Plus I've got an interview for the lead web developer position (hah!) in the newly reorganized development group set for Tuesday so things may be looking up on the career track. An  MCSD  would come in real handy right about now.

       urlLink VoiceObjects AG just joined the SALT forum , the standards body behind the newer XML based voice applications standard. What makes that interesting is that they're also very vocal (ha ha) members of the VoiceXML forum and that their platform is supposed to render to either platform. That certainly goes along with what Ian said about the voice standards being at such a low level that  urlLink no one actually codes to the standards  and instead operates at a much higher level.  Yet surely either VoiceXML or SALT have some unique advantages over each other? Well the big difference is that VoiceXML defines a default algorithm for flowing through questions and that in SALT you must code that yourself each time, but Microsoft's involvement in SALT makes clear that no one is actually expected to re-code that algorithm by hand: it's mindless grunt work and they've got tools to do it for you.  VoiceObjects' web pages don't have any details on the platform API itself, which is a real blow to me, since my workplace is still considering a transition to speech recognition and I'd like to nudge them onto the path of using an established platform rather than coding our own (in ASP no less). All I can really tell from their site is that  urlLink VoiceObjects uses Java  on the server, and probably straight servlets instead of J2EE. Either way it's clear that using an established VoiceXML framework means one of 2 approaches: 1) use Java (we're not ready for this), or 2) use XML-based web services (we're not ready for this either).  #2 is more likely in our case but in that scenario as well ICON's gonna need someone like me who knows a little bit about a broad range of XML standards. Either SOAP, AngelXML, or naked VoiceXML are all options that we may need to support in addition to pda-friendly HTML, XHTML-MP, and/or WML.

      I  still  don't get spinner rims. These are hubcaps that have an outer shell on ball bearings so that after the car stops the outer shell keeps on spinning. Yes they do sorta look cool on a brand new car when they're all shiny and look like a blurred sci-fi force field protruding from the tires. But do the people who own these realize that later in life the cheap ball bearings wear down at different rates and before long you have all&nbsp;4 spinners going at different speeds? It looks really bizarre. A car can stop and of the 2 on the side towards you one will be going quite fast while the other is just slowly turning. It induces a sort of horizontal vertigo where your eye isn't immediately sure just how fast the is/was going. They're probably rather brittle as well. I'm pretty utilitarian and tend to value things based on how well they last and how well they do their job, but you don't have to think that way to understand how useless spinners are.  Hey people: it's been  years  since they came out, they're no longer in already!

       win32com.client.constants  fetches constants defined in a type library only if  makepy  has generated a Python wrapper for the relevant typelib. Otherwise you have to define the constants yourself, typically fetching them out of the documentation for the objects you're using (various Office components in addition to ADODB in my case). If you use  py2exe  to link together a  urlLink redistributable package of Python code  you'd better  urlLink link in the makepy wrapper . The problem with doing that is that the build will then reference a very specific version of the COM object, since you have to put in the GUID (aka "strong name" nowadays) and the major/minor version numbers of the object. If you try to do this  'typelibs': [(code,0,1,2) for code in 'visio.application adodb.connection adodb.recordset'.split()]  you end up with  running py2exe *** generate typelib stubs *** Traceback (most recent call last):   File "H:\Validation\VoxDiff\Source\icophone\VoxDiff\Setup.py", line 55, in ?     options = {  ...    File "C:\Python23\lib\site-packages\py2exe\build_exe.py", line 1056, in collect_win32com_genpy     makepy.GenerateFromTypeLibSpec(info, bForDemand = True)   File "C:\Python23\lib\site-packages\win32com\client\makepy.py", line 194, in GenerateFromTypeLibSpec     tlb = pythoncom.LoadRegTypeLib(typelibCLSID, major, minor, lcid) pywintypes.com_error: (-2147319779, 'Library not registered.', None, None)  which is really not very happy for the obvious reason. I can't afford to bind  VoxDiff  to just version of Visio or  MDAC  since we have all sorts of funky versions across ICON so it seems that the best solution is just to replace  customProps = win32com.client.constants. urlLink visSectionProp   with  customProps = 0xF3 . I wonder why the AddSection method is  urlLink mis-capitalized  as "addSection" on that reference page?

      After wrestling for  hours  today ping ponging test builds back and forth with a developer trying to get the system to match a bad spec exactly I've been thinking  there has just got to be a better way . The only solution I can think of? Write a  strategically vague  design spec. What the hell does that mean? Well it means that your spec gives some leeway to the programmer. Some margin for error. Along with defining what's "just right" it ought to define what's "good enough". Merck will forgive us if we ship a few drug kits too many (though probably not too few) to an investigator site. So why write a precise (yet impossibly difficult to follow) spec? Well of course it's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is permission: we'd rather spec up front and have a nightmarish time meeting it than empower the programmer to make decisions and spec out where the areas are that it's okay for him to do what's best. All we need now is a good standard for how to express such "optionals" and "ranges".

      Here's the short version: go to  Tools|Internet Options...  and choose  Delete Files...  to clear your browser cache. Apparently there's some kind of hidden kung fu going on that's affected by the cache size. Another tip listed in the knowledge base is to shrink the size of your cache in order to prevent the problem from re-asserting itself later. It doesn't suggest a good size though.

      Everyone has been annoyed by Real's  urlLink heavy-handed sales pitch  at some point. It's hard to find their free player, and when you do it tries to make up for the fact that it's  urlLink not a part of Windows  by  urlLink getting in your face  every chance it gets. Well they're trying to get rid of that rep and it may be working. In fact, Car Talk  urlLink switched back to RealPlayer  after experimenting with Windows Media for a number of months. Real's sales team kicked into high gear and presented the Magliozzi brothers with free hosting for their audio, and an email pushing  urlLink "less-annoying" as a major feature  of RealPlayer 10.  Sales seems to sure have alot of power in any company. Anything to keep a client. I wonder why MS didn't respond in kind; they've got a much more powerful sales team. CarTalk is probably a major source of free content for Real though. They're just a more important client to Real than it is to Microsoft, where they're just a number. I guess it's an example of how you can get better customer service from a smaller company. There may be hope for Real yet. Other than  urlLink Helix  (which kicks [ urlLink four legged beast of burden ]!).

      There was a commentary on NPR today that ended with  urlLink a beautiful and pithy little sentence :  And perhaps today will remind us all that America is at its greatest when we greet the world with an outstretched arm, and when we lead not just with fire, but with light.
