      I noticed a story in the paper today about the recently concluded Summerslam event that happened, I think, in Toronto. I found out that the current World Wrestling Federation (sure, they can call it WWE all they want, but it's still the federation to me, know what I'm sayin'?) was a guy named Randy Orton. Randy Orton? No wonder pro-wrestling has completely gone down the crapper. Twelve years ago, this guy would've been partnered with, say, a Marty Jannetty and forced to don matching tights with a tag team partner. Now, he's the champion, for Pete's sake. What has civilization come to?  Suddenly, I began to long for the good old days of the early 90's, back when wrestling was still an enjoyable "sport" (and I use that term loosely) to watch. Back then, we were privileged to have classic matchups between Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior or Macho Man Randy Savage and Brutus the Barber Beefcake. Now we have Randy Orton and Christopher Nowinski. What happened to all the nicknames? The truly good nicknames? You know, Macho Man, Ravishing Rick Rude, Jake the Snake Roberts, etc. And how did wrestling somehow, within the past 12 years, transform from a showcase of mat maneuvers to a male version of a soap opera. In your average 2 hour wrestling show, only 27 minutes of it are actually devoted to wrestling. The rest of the time, you're listening to two really bad actors mouthing off to each other on wireless microphones. When did it all turn wrong?  It wasn't just wrestling. It was everything. Take, for example, TV shows in general. Today, reality TV is all the rage. We are so saturated in reality television that we have elevated the parodies of reality shows like "Joe Schmoe" and "Superstar USA" to prime time viewing habits. Reality TV has exposed us all us Peeping Toms, voyeur wannabees deprived of what we think is our constitutional right to pry into other people's lives. In the early 90's, the top shows were good sitcoms like "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and "Home Improvement." Speaking of Fresh Prince, what happened to the likeable Will Smith of 1992? When did he undergo that metamorphosis from cool Fresh Prince Will to "I'm King of the Universe" egotistical Will? And why did Carlton never achieve true celebrity status? He made that show! Where have you gone Alfonso Ribeiro? Why has North America chosen to embrace Will and cast you aside?  Everything from Wrestling to real sports to music to TV was just more innocent back then, wouldn't you agree? That was before the strike that killed baseball. That was before the dawn of 9 figure NBA contracts (We have Derrick Coleman and Glenn Robinson to thank for that). That was back when Boyz II Men were cool and both Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were still in the Mickey Mouse club. What has happened to the magic of those days? Why can't they make movies like "White Men Can't Jump" anymore? Why must everything be so postmodern when all we ever want is to be entertained?  Of course, I've talked about purely entertainment choices here. Real life probably wasn't as magical as we would like to remember it was back then.  But art and media have such profound influences on us that I can't help but acknowledge the truth of the statement that entertainment choices and pop culture are a reflection of a society's morals. So what has happened to our morals? When did it become acceptable to show violent plastic surgery on prime time ("The Swan")? When did someone like Paris Hilton discover that they could become famous by simply capitalizing off their, shall we say, extracurricular activities? When did we as a culture immersed in show business start to want to become actors and actresses who mutilate themselves for fame? Entertainment choices seem so unrelated to real life but actually, they're a lot more relevant than we think.   I don't think I'll ever see the magic of the early 90's again. I don't even think there was such a thing. It was probably just as corrupt as any other society (think 17th-18th century England and their libertines). But I for one, would like for people to stop and think about how they can help stop this downward slide towards that horrible future where 80% of your adult population will find their significant others through "Elimidate."  Talk about a dystopian vision of the future.   Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to try and download some old "Fresh Prince" episodes.   --Mark

      Yes! I finally finished University. After four long years of gruelling hard work, I finished my last exam on August 18th 2004 at 9:00 pm. It's going to take a while to get used to the fact that I am done school. From now on, there will be no more guilt when I've spent my free time doing no reading or studying because...I'm done school! And I don't think the feeling has totally sunk in yet. Maybe when I wake up tomorrow and I don't have to look at any more textbooks for the whole day, I will realize the extent of my blessed state.   I wanted to thank some people for helping me get through this last course, ENG216Y. Some very good-looking and very awesome people. Thank you to Kristy Fletcher, Antoinette Naughton and Tony Ellington for being my support group in this class. You guys helped me get through a very tough course for me. It wasn't tough because of the content. I think it was tough because it was the last one and I was so afraid of slacking off and not doing well. Thank you for being my personal lifesavers. So Kristy, Antoinette and Tony, I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I hope we get to meet again someday in a different setting. In fact, I already have one made up. Ready...here it goes: we all get to be extras on the set of Tom Cruise's newest major motion picture, "Barometer Rising." (based on the novel by Hugh MacLennan and co-starring Cate Blanchett as Penelope Wain)  I'd also like to thank the following people for helping me get through university: Papa, Mama, Mobin, Tita Vicky, Tita Liza, Tita Lorna, Nanay, Tito Lito, Tita Tes, Meldrick, Martin, Ate Arlene, Tim, Mr. and Mrs. Sreedharan, Mr. and Mrs. Reda, Dr. and Mrs. Perumalla, Peter Vanderherberg, Peter Lombara, Peter Dearlove, Vijay and Jen, Jamie and Vanessa, Wes, Mike and Elisha, Matt, Steve Hayhoe, Steve Doxsee, Sharon, Sarah, Regan, the Vandendools, Chuck, Damien and Darlene, the Cholys, Pastor Sam, Pastor Sunder, Pastor Alan, Scott and Cynthia Veals, Shawn Gray, Pastor Howard and Pastor Walter, Davika and all those I forgot to mention. Thank you. As you can plainly see, it takes a village to raise a university student who will eventually graduate.   And of course, none of this would have happened if God was not on my side the whole time. In fact, the diploma I get should have His name on it since He has provided miracle after miracle to ensure that I finish. Thank you for looking out for me, Lord. Indeed, all things are possible with You.   It turned out to be a pretty quiet moment after I had written the last sentence on my exam paper and turned it in. I always thought I would do something pretty wild after being done my last exam. It turns out, I just shook my professor's hand (although Kristy, Antoinette and Tony claim he gave me a "virtual hug") and left. I always thought I'd do something crazy like flip my desk or better yet, get up on my desk and start stripping down to my underwear while yelling: "so long suckers!" But no, it was a pretty uneventful final moment in the world of undergrad academia. Looking back, I should have done an end zone dance at least, or hid my cell phone somewhere in the room and call someone long distance as soon as I finished (after you, Joe Horn of the New Orleans Saints). But these things always cross your mind when it's actually too late to do anything.   In honor of my just completed undergrad degree, I will now present my personal list of the top 5 celebrations of all time, real and fictional of course.  I will also discuss why the celebration worked and why, on the other hand, it may not have been that good of an idea to begin with. So, without further ado:  Mark's Top 5 celebrations of all time:  5. The Mighty Ducks celebrate their Pee Wee state championship after beating the Hawks on Charlie Conway's penalty shot.    Why the celebration worked: Pure Disney Magic at its best. Gordon Bombay at least wins a championship after quitting from the law firm run by Mr. Ducksworth. Charlie's mom can't be accused of dating a loser anymore. Adam Banks wasn't cruelly injured for nothing (imagine if they had lost, Adam would've asked the nurse to give him unhealthy dosages of morphine, trust me).  And best of all, Coach Riley's string of 15 consecutive pee wee banners comes to and end, leaving him to ponder: maybe I could've coached high school or college hockey at some point instead of beating up a  bunch of helpless kids for all these years.  Why it may not have been a good idea after all: The mysterious disappearances of characters over the next 2 Mighty Ducks films begs the question: Did coach Bombay really care about his players? I mean, how could there be 2 Hall brothers (Jesse and Terry) in the first movie, one of them in the 2nd movie (Jesse) and none of them in the third one? And to think they replaced him with the kid from "GoodBurger?" Come on, I would've filed a suit if I were Jesse Jackson a long time ago for blatant racism. They clearly limited the number of black kids on their roster to two. And since the Asian had to be included in the 2nd movie (Ken Wu), there were enough minorities and poor Terry had to be shipped off to another family while his brother Jesse wins a gold medal for the US in the Junior Goodwill Games. For shame. Also, what ever happened to Karp, Peter and the Duncan Siblings? Am I the only one who notices these things?  4. Hulk Hogan celebrates the end of Wrestlemania VIII by beating Yokozuna after the big sumo wrestler had beaten Brett Hart for the WWF championship. (Hogan wins the belt after Yokozuna is the proud owner of it for 9 1/2 minutes)  Why the celebration worked: A few choice words for you: "I am a real American...fight for the rights of every man, I am a real American, fight for what's right, fight for your life!" A few more choice words: "If you hurt my friends, then you hurt my pride, I gotta be a man, I can't let it slide..." Sing along everybody!  Why it may not have been a good idea after all: When Hulkamania suddenly turned on the people that supported him and told kids that they drank their vitamins and said their prayers in vain...he probably turned into the most hated villain (but certainly one of the most entertaining ones) of all time as "Hollywood Hulk Hogan."  3. The 1997 Takeover of Hong Kong by the Chinese from the British  Why the celebration worked: After 99 years, the Chinese got back what was rightfully theirs.  Why it may not have been a good idea after all: Come on, you really think I would write anything in this space? Besides, if I even came up with one little point to put here, my Dad would probably disown me.   2. Apollo Creed shows up Ivan Drago minutes before their bout at the MGM Grand by entering the ring to the carnival of James Brown performing "Living in America."  Why the celebration worked: The Americans really showed us that their culture is so much better than the Russians' during that routine! Wow! I mean, of course a culture is much more civilized if the have: a) absolutely no sportsmanship or class during boxing matches, b) absolutely no understanding of what was really going on in the world at the time, and c) half naked dancers and the godfather of soul predict a sure victory minutes before the bout even begins just because this prediction would go well with their costumes. The celebration really had me wishing I was an American!  (Batman, the sarcasm meter is off the charts on this entry! It's going to blow!)  Why it may not have been a good idea after all: Ummm, Ivan Drago killed Apollo Creed in that fight, remember? No really. He literally killed the man. (If we were all to learn a valuable lesson from this, we would never ever gloat in front of a Russian again. Never again.)    1. Terrell Owens celebrates a touchdown by pulling a Sharpie out of his sock, signing the football he just caught, and tossing it to his agent in the stands.  Why the celebration worked: Possibly the best premeditated/spontaneous celebrations of all time. You know something's good when it can create its own paradox. And it increased T.O.'s popularity by 400% (even though it was mostly negative publicity, but as all you advertising people know, any publicity is good publicity).   Why it may not have been a good idea after all: You know, he could've tossed the ball to a kid near the endzone. Was this too much to ask? Can you imagine Brett the Hitman Hart taking off his glasses and giving them to Vince McMahon? Wouldn't you have just thrown tomatoes at him right at that moment? So why would you give an autographed ball to a man who could have your autograph at anytime? My theory is the ball was sold on ebay for $18.95 plus shipping and handling.   Well, that was a pretty long entry. Tune in next time for more entertaining reflections on life, love and all the other things that start with l.   Take Care,  Mark

      Today I had a chance to have coffee with my friend Chuck Kim (more popularly known as "Huck Chuck") and we got to have a pretty deep conversation about spiritual issues. There were two things I learned from this talk with Chuck that are probably going to be life-changing lessons for me:  1. We are imprisoned by theological fallacies we have come to believe and acknowledge as unshakable truths.  This is indeed unfortunate. I realized that how I thought God views me is not consistent with what it says in scripture. I have lived my life as if I could change how God views me by somehow doing more stuff for Him. But the truth of the matter is, even if I did nothing for Him, it wouldn't change the fact that God considers me His child and thinks of me as His precious treasure whom He loves dearly. So it is really freeing to live in this light--that no matter what I do, I cannot change the fact that God loves me with an everlasting love. Now I finally understand what my Mom has always told me: "Mark, you can do nothing that will make us love you more or love you less." You know, God thinks of us that way too. We can do nothing that will make Him love us more or love us less.   2. God looks at you and sees the same thing at the lowest and highest points of your spiritual walk.  It took me a while to realize the impact of this claim. Chuck explained that when God looks at us, He sees Jesus' robes that cover us. No matter how dirty we are inside, it is Christ's righteousness that makes us righteous. I don't think we could ever do anything to add to this righteousness or take away from it. So my question is, why do we try to live our lives as if righteousness depended on us?  Why not just live our lives as free men and women empowered by this truth? That Christ makes us holy and therefore we are free to abide in His love and enjoy life. I think this is the abundant life that Christ talks about in John 10:10. In my Bible translation, it says "life to the full." It is my desire to be able to live this life. I think I can only do it, though, once I have a correct understanding of how God views me.   So my tired soul may finally find rest in Christ's love if that is the case. It will probably take me a while to fully understand this concept, that God loves me for who I am and not what I do. But I think that in knowing this, I can do my ministry with a right attitude and a proper heart before God. Ministry, in this light, becomes "enjoyable overflow" as opposed to "obligated payment-work."  Pretty neat stuff, eh?  So take heart, US Olympic Men's Basketball Team. God loves you because you are LeBron James and co., and screwing up in front of only the biggest international sporting stage against a country with a population of only 4 million won't take away from His love for you. Sure, you might not be able to shoot your way out of a paper bag, but God loves you regardless. Sure, all those AND 1 mixtapes have so warped your sense of how the game of basketball should be played that your entire backcourt was outplayed by Carlos Arroyo. But it's okay, God loves you! And sure, you have disgraced the name "Dream Team" once and for all by allowing yourselves to be referred to as an installment of the original Dream Team in Barcelona, but it's okay. Larry Bird may never forgive you, but God does.   With that in mind, I have made a suggested list of 12 players along with the appropriate coaching staff that in my mind, will win the gold medal in the next major international basketball competition (i.e., world championships)  Starting Five: C-Tim Duncan PF-Jermaine O'Neal SF-Tayshaun Prince SG-Richard Hamilton PG-Dwyane Wade  Bench C-Erick Dampier F-Ron Artest F-Ben Wallace F-Shane Battier G-Ray Allen G-Paul Pierce G-Jason Williams (the new and improved White Chocolate)  Head Coach: Rick Carlisle (Indiana Pacers) Lead Assistant: Greg Popovich (San Antonio Spurs) Assistant: Hubie Brown (Memphis Grizzlies) Assistant: Jerry Sloan (Utah Jazz)  I mean, this team would not be glamorous, but it would win the gold. You'd have great perimeter defense in Prince and Artest. A tireless workhound who doesn't care how much he plays in Battier. You'd have the required speed in penetrators like Pierce and Dwyane Wade. And you'd have the necessary shooters to break the zone in Allen and Hamilton. Plus, you have a backup point guard whose primary focus is making sure the offense runs properly in Jason Williams (who would've thought this 4 years ago?). You'd have the toughness to bruise opposing frontlines to death in Ben Wallace and Dampier. Finally, you'd have the two best players who play with their back to the basket in Duncan and Jermaine O'Neal. Your coaching staff includes one of the most brilliant young minds in basketball in Carlisle, a true player's coach in Popovich, another player's coach in Brown and probably the best X's and O's basketball coach of all time in Jerry Sloan to orchestrate your offensive sets. This team would beat Puerto Rico by 24 points and not lose to them by the same amount.   So tune in next time for more insight on spiritual matters and for more fluent segways from theology to basketball. If only all basketball coaches could be theologians as well...Did that player commit a foul or did the foul choose him?   'Til next time,  Mark

      Welcome everyone to my first ever blog. Here you can learn all about what's going on in my life, what God is teaching me and what you can pray for to encourage and support me. I'll try my best to keep this blog entertaining and informational at the same time. So hold on to your hats, we're about to embark on our initial journey into the wonderful wonderful (well, most of the time, at least) world of Mark Chan.  Yesterday I saw my best friend Tim Sreedharan off at the airport. It was really quite special to be there. Tim's off on a 2 year mission stint to a Limited Access Nation (LAN). I was a bit sad to see him go because I'll miss him but in a way, I'm really happy that he gets to follow God in this way. Tim and I always had special conversations which were half serious and half, umm, well, shall we say intellectually challenged. But you know, this was how we kept each other in check. So I can already imagine what our first conversation will be when he gets back:  Mark: Tim, how does it feel to be elevated to sudden hero status for becoming an overseas missionary? It must be pretty high up that pedestal.  Tim: Oh please. Christian model, yes. Celebrity, yes. Living example of true sainthood, yes. But hero? Hero's a big word. I don't think I've attained that status yet. No, I'll stick with "living example of true sainthood" as my new found status.   Mark: I see they really fixed your pride problem in that Limited Access Nation you went to.   Tim: And how!  So yeah, I can already see that day when we have that conversation. In the meantime, in Tim's absence, I must try and find other people with whom I may have such exchanges of reason and thought. I've come up with a short list of people along with some pros and cons about them.   Candidates: 1. The Reverend Benny Hinn        Pros: Bling blingin more than Stephon Marbury after a 7 year contract extension. Cons: May transform anytime into the Christian Don King.   2. Christian Recording Artist Rebecca St. James Pros: Beautiful voice and physical features will ensure 100% attention on my part. Cons: The inevitable "I'm sorry to have to do this but I'm gonna have to ask you to marry me" outbursts from yours truly.   3. Former Toronto Maple Leaf Goalie Curtis Joseph Pros: Can't get anything past him glove side (where "glove side" is a metaphor for the emotional side of conversations). Cons: May take less money and abandon me for an accountability partner in Detroit.  So Timmy, man. I'm going to miss you. You're irreplacable brother. Here's to seeing you in God's perfect time.   And also, congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Mike and Elisha Lupson. One of the best weddings I've ever been to and by far the funniest and most captivating speech from the groom I have ever heard. If you're reading this, could one of you forward me the recipe to that Chicken in white wine sauce with almonds we had at the reception.   I still need to find the video of the reception and get the part when Sunder spins the hula hoop on his neck for 98 seconds. I plan to give it to Dave Pascoe and have it randomly show at the screen at some point during next week's sermon.   So drop by sometime soon for my next installment. Till next time, remember that old Chinese proverb--  Confucious say: "Baseball is wrong. Man with four balls cannot walk."  Till next time,  Mark
