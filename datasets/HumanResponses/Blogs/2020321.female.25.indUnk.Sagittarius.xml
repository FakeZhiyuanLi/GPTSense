      HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!! Tonight is the Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden & I think I'm ready for it! My fingernails are currently painted black & I can see black lipstick, fake eyelashes, fishnet stockings, a wig and a pair of wings in my future.

      Another busy day! After I left work 35 minutes late yesterday, the plan to get these presentation books copied & out the door (via overnight to L.A.) was for me to walk the book about 5 or 6 blocks to Kinko’s and have them make the 27 copies over the course of about 2 hours. Then I would have to go pick them up, bring them back to the office, hole-punch and then spiral-bind each one. Oh, and insert dividers for each of the 3 section. Not too bad, except that I wasn’t going to get the presentation until around Noon. Now, all of that has changed. Our Production Dept. will be able to complete the job on time for me to send them out today. However, I am now at the Production Dept’s beck & call for the rest of the day. Oh well, so much for a nice leisurely day without the boss.  On the laundry front, I was supposed to do them on Sunday; however, I kept Jackson on Sunday and didn’t get a chance to do them. Mondays are too busy to do them after work. So then my plan was to prep them and do them just as soon as I walked in the door from work yesterday. As noted, I was about 45 minutes late getting home yesterday so that ruled laundry duty. But today is the day!! I don’t care if I’m doing them at 10 o’clock tonight because we need our underwear back!! I’m trying to clear up my Thursday night so that I can go over to Amanda’s and meet her cousin. Friday night, Olivia, Chris and I are going to the Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden. We might even be able to score some backstage passes and party with the band afterward since Amanda’s cousin is a groupie and can get us in. This all remains to be seen since I haven’t actually met this cousin of hers. If we don’t party with the band, then I think Olivia and I will be going to Hogs & Heffers, which is the bar made famous by the movie Coyote Ugly. I plan on recovering Saturday, so that rules out laundry on that day! Busy, busy!  OK, now off to find some lunch and then back to the grindstone!

      Hey boo, not too much has been happenin round here, as always. But that's a good thing. No news is good news, right? Work is getting more and more stressful evryday. There are so many things I have to remember, sometimes I end up scanning in my pens and pencils rather than the pictures I'm supposed to be working on. Oh no!!! Roni is here to give me a ride home, so I will see you so very soon!!!!!!!!!! Love you!! And your little boy, too!

      Yesterday was so busy that I didn’t have time to post to my blog. Well, onto another day then. My boss left work an hour early yesterday because someone forgot to reset the office clock. I told him he deserved the extra hour. (Wonder if that will be reflected in a pay raise or bonus this year?) I did send him a nice basket of goodies for Boss’s day.  The latest to partake in the sweatshop clothing industry (unknowingly, of course) is Sean “P. Diddy” Combs. His clothing line, Sean Jean, is accused of using a Honduran sweatshop. It’s reported that they pay their workers $0.25 per $50 shirt that they sew. They work 11 to 12 hour shifts, subjected to daily body searches and contaminated drinking water. Ok, so I will not complain about my job today.  In a sad note, The Price is Right announcer Rod Roddy, died Monday at the age of 66.  And on this day in 1886: the Statue of Liberty, a gift from the people of France, was dedicated in New York Harbor.  OK, another busy day so I gotta get busy!

      It's the end of the weekend and I'm sitting here threatening my cat, Berg, with the water bottle in an effort to keep him from scratching at the front door. I think he does it just to get sprayed. I had a paper shopping bag on the floor yesterday and he climbed inside and sat like he was the king of the bag. I took a picture of him looking all regal-like. We have so many pictures of him on our computer, he has his own folder.  This weekend was the Gallien/LaCour family reunion, which is my Mom's side of the family. I hear that everything was very nice and everyone had a lovely time. Someone scored me my very own freshly printed copy of the   Gallien Family Cookbook  . I'm very excited about it! I'm very excited to learn that my cousin, Rachael Gallien Smith, is pregnant for the 2nd time! I have more to add to that list: 3 ladies at my work - Bea, Anna & Jenn. Very exciting indeed! I wonder if 2 more people I know will also become pregnant, as they say that these things happen in 3's. Hey, the theory held true last time!  Chris is working his little toes off at the Westin today. He had to work a double like he did last week. He hasn't actually called me today so I can only assume that means that he's been very busy today. That's good since time will have gone by faster for him. Jackson came over today & we played video games and watched Daredevil. We had a good time and then he had to go home and do his homework. I'm now on the phone with Becca, so I have to go now.

      FRIDAY! YEAH, FRIDAY! Chris and some of his new friends from the Mandarin Oriental are supposed to go bowling tonight at Chelsea Piers. They have black light bowling at this place. Even the pins glow in the dark! I wish I were going, but alas, I don’t think I’m invited. Maybe some time soon Cindy, Jackson, Chris and I can go and have some fun!   When you think of New York City, you think about how crowded it is with all of these millions of people, Times Square, cars honking, yellow cabs rushing past, Central Park, city buses and subway trains. As far as city pets are concerned, you’d also think most people would stick to the usual house cats and dogs of various sizes. Animals such as a dozen snakes, an alligator or a tiger would seem to be somewhat far-fetched, right? Not so, my friend, no so. But I can at least say that these animals seem to be confined to Harlem or the Upper West Side of Manhattan anyway. Let’s just hope they don’t find any of these pets in Queens.  In the news: A Swedish tourist tried to smuggle eight baby snakes into Australia. They found four venomous baby king cobras and four baby emerald tree boas strapped to his legs in homemade pouches. The cobras had died during the nine-hour flight, but the boas survived. He had planned to sell the snakes for $3500 in order to fund an eight-day vacation.  OK, flu shot done! I’m a big girl, I didn’t cry or pass out – go me!! Now my arm hurts though. It hurts more now than it did when she stuck my arm with the needle.

      A new episode of FRIENDS comes on tonight! I’m very excited! And Chris doesn’t have to work tonight, so we get to spend some time together!! Today is a good day – so far. Tomorrow we get free flu shots here at work. Nice little incentive they give us here at my work. It’s free for me & Chris, but there’s no way I’ll be able to get Chris around a needle much less have him volunteer to be stuck by one.  Today I find myself stuffing envelopes with invites to each state treasurer for the National Association of State Treasurers meeting here in NYC. Our company is hosting a dinner and program for them, which includes Jeff Greenfield (political commentator and reporter) as speaker. Meanwhile, I’m also looking for flights home for Christmas. These airlines are really sticking it to us with these holiday fares! Normally, it costs me about $225-$250 to fly home roundtrip. For Christmas, I’m seeing fares anywhere from $285 on up. I still don’t know if Chris will get to come home for Christmas. I keep trying to get him to give me an answer so that I can go ahead and get tickets.  Little known fact: Tuberculosis was New York City’s leading killer in 1913. It was also known as consumption because of the way it consumed its emaciated victims.

      Wow! It’s quite chilly outside & the temperature is supposed to drop throughout the day. Definitely a leather coat type of day! I’ve just read that the “hot” Halloween costumes for women these days are Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders or to dress as Trinity from the Matrix – just in case you’re still looking for ideas. Also in the news: the next installment of “Surreal Life” will include both Tammy Faye Messner (the ex-Mrs. Baker) and Ron Jeremy (the porn king). OK, so does anyone else see any conflicts of interest here? The show will also include Vanilla Ice, “ChiPs” actor Erik Estrada, “Baywatch” actress Tracy Bingham, “Real World: Las Vegas” housemate Trishelle.  One of the ladies I work with, Ada, just got back from France. She brought us some lavender soaps when she went to visit the factory at Le Chateau du Bois. They smell soooo good!! A small observation from my little desk here on the 36th floor in Rockefeller Plaza: there are a lot of people that I work with who literally drag their feet when the walk. I’m totally shocked as I stop myself from saying, “Pick up your feet!” They all sound like they’re trying to ski on carpet.

      Another day, another dollar, another headache. Today is my 3rd and final day to sit in for the president’s assistant. This morning, he gave me a box of 4 chocolates that he got at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington DC last week. I’m saving them for dessert! No leftovers for lunch; Subway instead. It’s double stamp day!!    So what else is new? They say that today is an “Indian Summer” day – which for us means that the high for today is 69. I’m all for Indian Summer days!   In today’s HEADLINES dept: A man is suing Wheel of Fortune host, Pat Sajak, over a hug he received on the show that he claims hurt his back so bad, he needed surgery and months of rehab. A Michigan man survived a plunge over Niagara Falls. He wore no protective devices, etc., just the clothes on his back. Amazing, but now he’s wearing handcuffs and is sitting in some holding cell somewhere in Ontario. I’m currently reading a story on the Times Picayune website about this bacterium that appears as a small bump and then swells and is very painful. As it turns out, this mysterious little bacterium is resistant to penicillin, etc. It’s very contagious. I’ll let you know how it turns out.  And on this day in 1879, Thomas Edison invented a workable electric light at his laboratory in Menlo Park, NJ. (courtesy New York Times)

      Today is my 2nd day of sitting in for the President’s assistant. I have a feeling (and hope) that today will be even duller than this past Friday. Laurren, the president’s assistant, is in California for about 6 weeks working on her acting career. This weekend I was pretty lazy, but then again, when has my weekend been exciting lately? I made King Ranch Chicken Casserole yesterday evening and it is pretty good, but it doesn’t beat my Mom’s.  Big CONGRATULATIONS go out to JASON & JENNIFER WHITTINGTON, who just got married this past Saturday in Natchitoches, La.  New findings from this weekend: there is a device called an Octadog, which turns an ordinary hotdog into an octopus you can eat. Interesting and just a bit scary as well! (MSRP $16.95) I also discovered a popcorn fork – so you don’t have to worry about getting that pesky butter all over your fingers cause I know that’s always been my biggest problem!! Today’s discovery is: “Snapple Pie” hits store shelves. OK, it’s not an actual pie but an apple pie flavored Snapple drink. It’s only available for a limited time (Oct-Dec 2003) to coincide with apple picking and the holiday season. Do I dare try this one?  OK, now onto this whole David Blaine stunt. I can’t figure out why anyone would want to literally starve themselves for, what, 44 days?!? Publicity? Is he just that vain? I don’t know. Now the guy will have to be weaned back onto solid foods. I mean is that the sort of thing that tickles his fancy? I guess we all know what our own reactions would be to that sort of proposition. You certainly didn’t catch me hanging from a cardboard box suspended 10 feet above the ground behind my Queens apartment building, now did you?  Oh, and now for the kicker: There are reports that Prince (yep, the rock star, Prince) has been going from door to door to door sharing his Jehovah’s witness faith in the Minneapolis area. Now if that isn’t strange . . .

      It certainly has been a lazy weekend for me. I actually got to spend some time with Chris Friday night and Saturday morning - it was a real treat! I made raspberry scones for breakfast (it was a mix). Now it's Sunday morning and after only an hour of sleep, Chris is back at work to pull a double. I would feel bad for him except the only reason he got so little sleep was because he and Sergio went out for drinks after work. Sergio ended up crashing here as he also had to be back up at work to pull a double today. I'm just hoping that they let Chris come home early so he can get a little sleep.  Otherwise, it's all been pretty quiet. The weather is really beginning to get cold out there. This time of year usually marks the beginning of my semi-hibernation. The colder it gets outside, the less you'll see me on the streets of Manhattan! That's what I hate so much about living up here - because this shit lasts for about 6 months. I'm going to try to be better this year than I was last year. I just ended up getting really depressed about the whole situation, but I'm hoping I can pull out of it this time around. We'll see!

      WE’RE GOING TO THE WORLD SERIES BABY!! GO YANKEES!! OK, so I didn’t stay up and watch the end of the game, but I’m glad they’re going nonetheless. Today is finally Friday and I, technically, get to sleep in tomorrow morning depending upon what time Chris has to get up to go to work. That boy could use some sleep for sure! But I know if we have some spare time, he wants to go see Kill Bill.  Today’s lunch consists of leftovers from last night’s meal. I baked boneless, skinless chicken breasts along with potatoes & carrots – all sprinkled with some Lipton Onion soup mix & garlic salt. It turned out quite nice indeed! Unfortunately, there weren’t any carrots left over from last night’s meal, so I have to run down to Au Bon Pain at around Noon to pick up a little something to accompany my chicken and potatoes.

      I’m really excited today since I can get a large soup for just $3 from Hale & Hearty Soups!! I’ve been looking forward to it since that tall strange man shoved the institutional green flyer at me yesterday afternoon. I was about to tell him off until I heard exactly what he said. Then I’m like “Hell Yeah!!” On a sad front, there was the whole State Island Ferry accident yesterday afternoon. Luckily, I don’t like on Staten Island and to be quite honest, I’m not sure why anyone would – it’s entirely too far away!!  On a good note, after Chris is done with orientation today (around 4 pm) he’s free to go home and sleep his little heart out. He’s done well this week working both jobs, etc., but I noticed this morning that he didn’t roll out of bed in his usual chipper mood. I think this schedule is beginning to take its toll on him and I wonder if it will really ever get any better unless he quits one of these jobs. Looks like we’ll have to wait and see.  Hey Bec, get your cats fixed - especially the male - unless you want him to start spraying in the corners. I hear you can never really get rid of that smell. Well, off to my discounted soup . . .

      Hey Donna boo. I see you've been very busy these past few days. You should dismantle that push cart for what it did to you. No push cart will ever hurt you again!  Not too much has been going on around here. Work is keeping me busy. But it pays the bills, so I refuse to complain! Mr Lovan Tomas (my kittie) is about to lose his manhood. Roni and I have finally saved enough pennies that we can now take his hairy ass to a doctor that works out of his back yard. Just playin. But we are castrating him. That'll teach him to sniff ass around our house.  Well, I guess I must get back to work now. I hope your week is so great you'll need two days to recover.......I love you!!!

      I’ve never considered myself a sports fan. I mean, I’ve gone to a Mets game, but that was over a year ago (August 2001). During that outing, I purchased: a Mike Piazza jersey, the commemorative beer cup and various eats/beer that tinkered on the verge of $100 for the day. I had a blast, but it was an expensive outing nonetheless. Fast forward to the ALCS 2003: NY Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox. I’ll admit that I’m not glued to the TV as soon as it comes on, but I’ve actually been pulling for the Yankees (Amanda pulls for the Red Sox). Chris and I actually sat down Saturday night and watched one of the games – OK, so he fell asleep while I watched the game. And I was just as shocked as everyone else when a fan reached out and snatched the ball away from the Cubs preventing them from making the 2nd out in the 8th inning in last night’s game. I’m no diehard, but I’m wondering where this newfound interest in baseball is coming from. Incidentally, last night Chris ending up having to work a little late at the Westin due to the Red Sox coming in.  They always seem to stay at the Westin, which is nice for Chris since they tip well, but their luggage rolled in shortly afterwards and they ended up doing room drops.  But as long as they tip well . . .  By the way, if you’re keeping count, today’s lunch will either consist of a chicken, broccoli & cheese hot pocket or (if I’m being bad) a salad, which will cost about $7.  IN THE NEWS: I just read “Rome Rocks to Mother Teresa, the musical.” And then I read another story where a 9-month pregnant woman chased a 4-year-old kid around a McDonald’s restaurant and rubbed hot French fries in his face after he spilled ice cream on her shirt. What is this world coming to, I ask you? Ok, so in case you are unaware, I read news websites all the livelong day while at work trying to keep myself occupied.  I do work when I have it, but for the most part, I have enough spare time to visit about 10 to 12 news sites a day along with other sites.

      Today's lunch is leftover pork chop, corn & scalloped potatoes from last night. Good stuff! I've been busy today at work, which is not exactly the norm around here. Chris has been super busy with all of his working - and as John W puts it, his luggage/baggage fetish. It looks like we'll actually get to see each other this Friday evening, which makes me a very happy girl! Don't know if anyone has checked out Courtenay's blog, but I like to take a look every day as it appears to be much more interesting than my life right now! I'm planning to get a package together to send to her of NYC tourist stuff and if I can find something unique, I'll throw that in there too. Ok, off to take a small walk outside since it will probably be the only sunshine I'll see today. Oh, I just found what I'm going to get my 2 bosses for Bosses Day this Thursday: the Gourmet Orchard Basket from 1-800-flowers. They're really into this eating healthy stuff!

      Monday, Monday, boring Monday. It was so quiet at work that I nearly fell asleep at my desk. Sad, but true. Ah, living in NYC - isn't it glamorous? Amanda is coming over tonight to watch Monster House and wrestling.  Last night, I had the strangest dream: I was driving through these small narrow streets all over this city. Which city, I have no idea. Finally, I park my car and I end up at this diner where they're serving po-boys with sausage, peppers and mashed potatoes & gravy - all on the po-boy! And I'm upset because they're taking forever to take my order when there isn't anyone there. I remember saying how it had been a whole 30 minutes and they just keep staring at me. Why won't they take my order?!? I think I woke up around 4:30 am with a stomach ache and feeling nauseous. Maybe it was from the po-boy.

      I have done pretty much nothing this weekend. Too much to drink Friday evening means recuperating all day Saturday. No more wine!! Beer is safe, wine is bad! Thankfully, Chris took care of me.  By the way, my leg hurts so much from Thursday's fall on top of the push cart.  It has been throbbing like crazy! I couldn't really take anything for it Saturday since I figured I would just throw it up. Today, today will be better . . .

      Today's lunch is cheese ravioli w/tomato & basil sauce from Caccina below Rockefeller Center. Not bad, though it could use more tomato sauce. It has a slight kick to it. Today is finally Friday and I did NOT start the day off on a good foot. To start with, I was bringing laundry back last night in the push cart & with the army bag on top of it when the cart tipped over and I fell on top of it. I didn't fall all the way down, though my right shin is quite bruised today. Then, this morning at Au Bon Pain, I dropped a couple of quarters then a $5 bill.  When I went to pick up the money, I lost my balance and kind of fell, but not all the way (again). Embarrassing, but at that point, I just didn't care anymore. I took my everything bagel and went & ate my breakfast at my desk, only I kept dropping my container of cream cheese on the way back from the kitchen. I just hope no one gives me a child to hold today! I'm afraid of what I might do!  On the job front, Chris started orientation today at the Mandarin Oriental. This whole thing has moved so quickly that he hasn't had time to work out what he'll do with his other job at the Westin. Luckily, he's off for a few days and doesn't have to worry about that until Sunday morning. Ok, got to go down to the messenger center in our building to pick up a food order. Until tonight . . .

      Well, Chris just got a new job - luggage attendant at the Mandarin Oriental New York Hotel at Columbus Circle. He starts orientation tomorrow morning. Everything with this new job has happened very quickly. He still has his job as a luggage attendant at the Westin Times Square. He isn't sure how or what he's going to do just yet about the Westin. He could work there just part time, but he's planning to work the Mandarin Oriental full time as they pay much more per hour. Otherwise, I guess not much is happening up here. We're going out tomorrow night to the Moroccan tapas bar to wish Gerard & Judy all the best in Washington DC. Well, until tomorrow . . .

      Hump day, hump day & feeling a little better day! I think my mixture of Robitussin & Nyquil is doing me some good finally! I'm about to head to lunch with some of the girls I work with. Laurren is leaving for California next week and she'll be gone for a month. We're either going for Thai or Indian food. Speaking of food, we're going to a Moroccan tapas bar on Friday to wish our friends, Gerard Judy & Monique, all the best when they move off to Washington DC. Gerard leaves this Sunday and Judy & Monique will leave in a month. OK, it's off to the Thai place . . . yum!!

      Well, it's Tuesday and I think I'm feeling worse by the day. Whatever I have is about to slam into my chest, so I've decided to put some 'tussin on it. We'll see if that clears it up.   Bec, I've taken a consensus and I don't think you should give Bryant a Mohawk. Turns out that parents really don't appreciate that sort of thing, but if you've got the balls . . . Chris has decided to pay tribute to our friend Ray by dressing up as a transvestite Viking for Halloween if we can find everything he needs. Don't worry, I'll send pictures!   You know, I haven't been to the Fair in years & I absolutely love the Zipper or whatever they're calling it this year. Ironically, I'm terrified of the Ferris Wheel. Go figure!  Well, the weather isn't too bad. It gets into the lower 60s during the day and into the 40s at night. I still can't figure out if what happened over the last 2 or 3 months up here actually qualifies as a summer. I'm dreading the winter this year. Last year was especially rough on me. Nothing beats a good ole Louisiana winter - or really a Louisiana anything! Looks like I'm a bit biased, but who can blame me? ~ Donna

      Chris & I are going to a concert on Halloween night with a girl that I work with - Olivia.  Olivia and I are dressing up. We have wings and wigs - the rest is still kind of up in the air. I think Chris and I may go pick out his costume this weekend.  I found out this morning that our friends Gerard & Judy are moving back to Wasington DC. We haven't seen them since April & now I find out they're leaving in a week - time flies! I was supposed to go over to Amanda's apt. last night to watch Smackdown (wrestling), but I don't feel well and really didn't feel like standing out on the (elevated) train platform waiting for the subway. And wouldn't you know, I walk outside today and can see my breath. I guess it's out with the denim jacket and in with the leather coat. Where has our summer gone I ask you?!? At least it's Friday! I can sleep in tomorrow!! And Becca, Dr. Pepper at 8 am? I'm scared to ask what you're currently eating for breakfast.  It's probably twinkies, chips or twix bars!

      Good morning, Donna! How was your coffee? My Dr. Pepper was amazingly refreshing so early in the morning. But you've been up for much longer than I, eh? I hope your Friday is great. Don't you love Fridays? I LOVE Fridays! You've got the whole weekend!!!! Love y'all and miss you already! See you soon!  Love Becca

      Well, this is my very first post! I just got home from work in midtown Manhattan. It seems that no matter where I live, I do the same thing - put on my pjs as soon as possible!  Creature of habit, i guess. I'm hoping that my future blogs will be more exciting. Maybe after my mixture of Theraflu and Nyquil kicks in, things might get interesting.  We got back Monday night from a little trip to Rayville for a friend's wedding - Brad. We had a blast, we just didn't get any sleep! Well, I guess we'll sleep this weekend. Can't wait to go home for Christmas, maybe even get to see more of my family & friends this time around. Well, till next time or unless something astonishing happens tonight . . .

      I just found the coolest website for ordering  urlLink 80s t-shirts  and memorabilia for all of you holiday shoppers out there. That's all I really have today since I'm on cleaning duty today. I've already done part 1 of dishes and I have just a few more to do, but I ran out of drying space. Go figure. Stupid small apartment. After my coffee and then shower, I'll be off to do laundry which I have done in nearly 2 weeks. Good thing I stocked up on underwear last time I was in Louisiana!  I've discovered that visitors to my website who are using a Macintosh have trouble clicking on my links. I will eventually get the links added to this blog site so that you may access pictures from here. Unfortunately, I don't know a lick about html code as I've just been winging it up until now. I'll have to find out more since the "easy-to-use" wizards that I used to set up these sites is no longer available to me. So much for resting a bit and sitting pretty. Time to get back to work and learn me something. Who knows, if I figure it all out, maybe I can work something out with the Natchitoches Times (newspaper) so they can update their own website and I can read all of the local hometown dirt from the comfort of my leather Administrative Assistant's chair on the 36th floor Rockefeller Center. Perhaps I can teach Becca when I go home at Christmas and she can update their site and thereby pay her more money. Note to Becca - discuss with Charles! You never really know until you ask. And this way, they won't have to contract the job out.

      Thanksgiving! Good! Just Cindy & me for Thanksgiving day, so we ended up drinking, eating and watching the Clean Sweep marathon and then Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood. Ok, so it was a chick-flick kind of day. We had a good time, though. Chris had his turkey dinner on Friday and then we ordered in Chinese Friday night. ENOUGH TURKEY!!  Gay as the day is long - check out this website for “ urlLink Smittens .” Need I say anything else? Anyway, we all remember the Mel Gibson movie  Conspiracy Theory right? Well, they must have based the movie on this guy. Check out this website. I admit that I haven’t finished reading the whole thing since it’s 10 pages long and I have a life, but I read over the first 2 pages. Maybe this guy needs to make a visit to a mental institution.  urlLink http://www.drunkbastard.net/resume.htm   This next little link is just interesting. As a woman, I keep a lot of junk in my purse, but it’s always fun to see what other women have in their purses. Check it out at  urlLink http://www.poeki.net/bags   OK, I really need to do laundry today, but I’ll probably wait until tomorrow since Chris will be at work. Looking around my apartment, I think maybe I need to do a little cleaning as well.

      It’s Pre-Turkey day!! All I have left to get are slivered almonds and a small aluminum-roasting pan. That’s pretty good for me! Cindy took Jackson to the halfway point to Albany where he’ll meet his grandfather and spend Thanksgiving. Tomorrow, she’ll come over and we’ll have a girlie turkey day! I think we’ll be cooking everything at my place, but since we’re basically cooking for 3, there’s not a whole lot to do. I read about this root from Peru that I see all the time at the grocery & produce stores in my neighborhood. It’s called yacon and it’s a root that scientists say is “good for the gut, potentially safeguards against cancer, helps absorption of calcium and vitamins and can lessen the blood sugar peaks from eating sweet food that are a problem for diabetics. Though packed with sugar, its principal appeal to the health conscious lies in the fact that the sugar in question is mainly oligofructose, which cannot be absorbed by the body.” (courtesy MSNBC.com)  Last night, I was surfing the web and came across this link to an anti-rape patent. I’d seen it before, but now that I have an outlet for sharing crazy things with others, here ya go: http://www.levins.com/asm-7.html urlLink

      Hey big donna!!! It's Thanksgiving again. And what are we gonna do this year? That's my big question.  The concert was so f*ck@ng awesome. We got to meet all three bands. After the first band got off stage we went to talk to them and me and Roni were talking to the bassist and the lead singer and then Trevor and Jacob walked off. Roni and I, not wanting to be rude and just walk off too, stood there and talk to them for a few minutes, until Trevor and Jacob came back and told them not to take their girls from them. So, that's pretty exciting, we got hit on by two band guys, hot ones too! I'll have to show yo the pictures as soon as I can figure out how to get them on the computer. But the bad thing was the ride home. Soooo close to Natchitoches and that poo-nanny of a trooper had to make his quota. It's gonna cost me $162, but I think I figured out a way for it not to show up on my insurance. I shouldn't own a car. I don't know what's wrong with me. Everytime I try to be the bestest driver, something stupid always happens. (cough*cough*LOSER*cough*cough)  Mom's cooking stew for us for lunch. I'll eat two bowls, one for me and one for you! Christmas is coming up so fast! I can't wait for everyone to be home. We should definately take some pictures. Well, its time for you to work, young lady, and it's time for me to pretend to work. Tell Chris to take it easy big pimp and I'll see you oh so soon!!!!!  Love you,  Becca

      Too busy to post yesterday from work and I couldn’t access the site once I got home, so here I am today with the updates you’ve all been waiting for: We are now the proud owners of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the extended edition. Who’d have guessed? Probably anyone who knows Chris, that’s who. We had a good weekend. We watched 28 Days Later on Friday night and just hung out and ate popcorn. On Saturday, we headed to Best Buy to pick up our latest round of DVDs. On Sunday, Amanda and I went to Union Square to the Christmas Market. I got a new scarf, which is just the coolest. I also got this little herbal heat/cold pack that I’ll probably give as a Christmas gift to one of my grandparents. Then we went down toward Houston Street to watch the cute guys playing street hockey. So worth the time! Last night, I realize that I hadn’t done my Thanksgiving shopping for Thursday, so it looks like I’ll be running around looking for a turkey breast today and maybe tomorrow. If I can’t find a turkey breast, then we’ll be having ham. Every year before this, Chris has always gotten a turkey from the hotel. I wonder how much this is going to cost? I wrote that last little bit yesterday, so I can now tell you that a 5 lb. turkey breast cost just under $10. And let me just say that pine nuts are quite expensive! My recipe calls for a mixture of pine nuts and slivered almonds. I found the pine nuts, but I still have to go get everything else for my Thanksgiving meal.  I can’t help but feel like I’m stuck in a state of frustration these days. It comes from many angles, most which I cannot openly pinpoint on this public blog. Into my private journals they will go. I’ll be going home in just under 1 month. Yeah! I’m looking forward to it, but I also don’t like flying alone. Not much I can do for that though. I hate leaving Chris behind, but at the same time, I can’t let a free ticket home go to waste – not that I want to! I think my plan this time around is to take as many pictures with our digital camera as possible. I’ll bring our video camera, but I want lots of digital pics!  On Monday’s AP: Border agents last week landed a meaty bust, seizing 756 pounds of bologna arranged into the shape of a car seat and covered with blankets in a man's pickup.  Also, Media mogul Ted Turner has taken a small step to demonstrate his belief that women should run the world because men have "mucked it up" with too much warfare and military spending.  I first read this yesterday evening and I’m not sure exactly what to say about it except, maybe that’s what he deserved. See for yourself: PARTICIPANT AT KKK INITIATION WOUNDED AFTER SHOTS FIRED INTO SKY. JOHNSON CITY, Tennessee (AP) -- A bullet fired in the air during a Ku Klux Klan initiation ceremony came down and struck a participant in the head, critically injuring him, authorities said. Gregory Allen Freeman, 45, was charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment in the Saturday night incident that wounded Jeffery S. Murr, 24. About 10 people, including two children, had gathered for the ceremony. The man who was being initiated was blindfolded, tied with a noose to a tree and shot with paintball guns as Freeman fired a pistol in the air to provide the sound of real gunfire, Sheriff Fred Phillips said. A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited at the bottom of his skull, authorities said. Freeman fled the ceremony but was arrested near his home, authorities said. He was released on $7,500 bail. (courtesy CNN.com)

      The sun is a beautiful thing. It’s so nice to see sunlight. I realize this must seem a strange statement to my friends and family back home, but with all of these tall buildings here in the city, you don’t actually see the sun. I’m so glad that today is Friday! It felt weird not having to wake Chris up at 4 something this morning, but I automatically woke up anyway. Once I remembered that Chris was off today, I turned back over and drifted off to la-la land.  Well, it’s official: The “naked photographer” has been captured in Ohio. This guy, who happens to be a staff lawyer for the state House, ambushed women in order to take pictures of their shocked expressions. Huh? He was charged with public indecency and assault, posted bail and was released. He was then rearrested the following day when investigators searched his home and found incriminating photos, which led to charges of felony kidnapping and gross sexual imposition. Police think he kept these photos as souvenirs. Just goes to show you that being a pack rat can be a bad thing.  There is a story on WNBC.com concerning the death of a college student who died after riding on top of a subway train last weekend, the 6 train to be exact. The stupid thing is that someone did the same thing in October. They died. This most current subway surfer wasn’t alone. Another student died instantly of a fractured skull. The tunnels here in NYC aren’t like those that I’ve seen in Washington DC. In DC, the tunnels are huge. Here, they’re just big enough for the trains to fit through. In sad news, also from WNBC.com, an elderly man was killed by a street sweeper after being crushed and possibly dragged after the sweeper backed up. OK, I read this one and started to pass it up, but I just couldn’t do it. In the Manhattan Supreme Court, celebrities honored jury duty at the Court’s Juror Appreciation Day. In the presence of other famous New Yorkers -- Regis Philbin, James Earl Jones, Ralph Lauren – Twyla Tharp danced, Judy Collins sang, and Jon Stewart joked. Seems silly enough, but read the  urlLink article .   I read an interesting article on MSNBC.com about resistance to the Patriot Act. To be quite honest, I don’t know exactly how I feel about the Act myself, but I thought it was a good read, so check it out.   urlLink http://www.msnbc.com/news/996267.asp?0cv=CB20   People magazine has named Johnny Depp as the Sexiest Man Alive. I agree.  To lose one pound, it is necessary to cheat the body of 3,500 calories — say, 500 a day for a week, or 350 a day for 10 days.

      Not much happening in my world today, thus far. It’s a rainy day here in the Big Apple, but it’s getting brighter outside. If you have access to BBC America (the TV station) and you like shows like Trading Spaces, then you should watch Homefront in the Garden on Wednesdays. You’ll have to check your local listings, but it comes on at 8 pm here. They don’t just re-do your typical garden. What they do is amazing and somewhat mind-blowing. It’s only a 30-minute show so it’s quick to see results. I watched the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show last night on TV. I love lingerie, so I had to watch. They had some very interesting pieces showcased. If only my closet was big enough . . .   There’s a story out on the web about a guy in Ohio who is in jail on forgery charges. He struck a deal for them to table his transfer from a local jail to a state prison all so that he could watch a football game on TV over the weekend. The place where he’s going doesn’t have TV for inmates. Interesting fact courtesy of NYTIMES.com: Berlin is the world's first major city to switch from analog to entirely digital television broadcasting. The transition went almost unnoticed in Germany or elsewhere, which is remarkable, given that in the United States, the same process has been bogged down by politics.  On a poll on CNN.com this morning, the question was raised “Are you shocked by the charges against Michael Jackson?” Not surprisingly, 93% weren’t shocked. Go figure.  That’s really all for today. I’m going home for Christmas one month from today. I don’t like leaving Chris alone during Christmas, but I can’t pass up a free trip home either. I can justify my guilt by reminding myself that he’ll be working the entire time anyway. It’s a good thing Mom & Dad have a new calling plan that allows them to call nationwide for no extra charge. Hope they’re not surprised when they get their bill and find that I called Chris at 3 am local time every morning to wake him up. Oh! And I’m working on filling out my insurance forms for re-enrollment for next year. Pain in the ass, let me tell ya!! Well, it’s getting closer to lunch time - time to post. I think Dawn & I will be heading to Au Bon Pain today. She wants a salad and I think I’m going to get a tuna sandwich. I’ve had soup at least 3 times this week. I’m tired of soup. Watch me end up getting soup.

      By now, you’ve surely seen or heard the stories that Michael Jackson’s estate, Neverland Ranch, was searched by investigators on claims than another 12 or 13-year-old boy was molested while on the property. Police came armed with an arrest warrant with Jackson’s name along with 60 to 70 investigators. From dangling babies over the side of balconies to admittedly sleeping in the same bed as young children that he brings into his home, it’s about time someone or some agency investigated this man. I’ll agree that he was all the rage in the 80’s, but there is a limit! Oh, and I was watching the news this morning as I’m getting ready and I see that a few Wall Street brokers were arrested for taking commissions on deals that never went through. Bad brokers. Can’t really feel sorry for them since what they did was wrong and I see them as being a money-hungry type of person anyway. I guess it really doesn’t surprise me that they’ve finally been arrested.  On the war front, Chris & I have a friend who is in the Marines, Jeremy Lewis. He’s like 20 to 40 days away from getting out, but his group has been pulled to go to Iraq. I don’t know how long he’ll be there and I’m not sure he really knows either. Once he finishes over there, he’ll come back home and then he’ll have an additional 90 days left to complete. Then he’ll finally be released. I’ll be happy when that happens.   Interesting fact for you on this rainy Wednesday: The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any other country by far. Each American, on average, generates about 45,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. That is about twice as much as the average person living in Japan or Europe.  I read a story this morning on how women are getting their feet surgically altered in order to wear fashionable shoes. The surgeries are actually medically necessary or would be at some point. They are for removing corns, calluses, bunions, correcting hammertoes, etc., which I can’t knock. I think it was the quote at the end of the story by flight attendant Gloria Diaz: “I don't care what my feet feel like," she said. "I will wear a beautiful shoe no matter how much it hurts if I have to, but now it doesn't have to hurt!" (courtesy MSNBC.com)  OK, and finally for one of the most insane things I’ve heard/read lately: Hip-hop magazine, The Source, has accused Eminem, the rapper, of racism. He allegedly said, “Black girls are dumb, and white girls are good chicks” on an album that dates back to 1993. On the tape, he was rapping about his breakup with his black girlfriend. He said that he made it out of frustration right after their breakup. I’m not saying that he didn’t say this, but has ANYONE listened to his songs? Is this suddenly the only outlandish thing he’s done? The guy has been sued by his own mother – enough said. He’s always been followed by controversy. It’s what he does best.  Wait, I just read something else that, well, as Jerry Brown puts it, “makes your bootie wink”: A Texas baby is recovering Tuesday, one day after doctors at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park created an anal opening for him. Chief of Pediatric Surgery Dr. Alberto Pena performed the rare anorectal surgery on the 10-month-old baby boy Monday. The operation was teleconferenced live to Hadassah Hospital in Israel, where about 80 surgeons from Israel, Greece, Turkey and Italy watched. Pena developed the procedure and has done about 1,700 anorectal surgeries since 1986. He says the problem is a birth defect in which the anus and rectum do not develop properly. This type of malformation affects one in 5,000 newborns annually. (courtesy WNBC.com)  And finally, on this day in 1863: President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.

      So far, today is a much more relaxed day than yesterday. However, I now have my “irk” of the day: I booked roundtrip tickets for someone that I work for. I was given the dates by someone else. Flights booked, itinerary printed, placed in folder & given to traveler. Today, I find out that they never went on that trip nor was it cancelled. We’ve lost the money on that trip and we really can’t do anything about it. I feel like yelling at the person who gave me the dates because she looks at me all innocently, but I’m not going to yell or really say anything because it wouldn’t do any good. In truth, she could have given me the correct dates and I just screwed everything up myself. Who really knows at this point? Luckily, it wasn’t one of our most expensive trips. Instead, I’ll just take a few deep breaths and try to think about other things and how I can make this whole situation better. But I still want to hit something.  In breaking news: the Massachusetts' highest court today ruled that the state couldn’t deny gays and lesbians the right to marry. The court stopped short of allowing marriage licenses to be issued to the couples that challenged the existing law -- and gave the state Legislature 180 days to find a solution. (courtesy CNN.com) Interesting development considering if one state allows same sex marriages, then all states must allow them. I’ll be curious to see how this one ends.  We’ve all heard of jelly bracelets. We wore them in the 80’s (a-la Madonna style) and they are of course making a comeback. However, in some of the local schools here in NYC, the jelly bracelets are associated with a game called “snap” in which different colored bracelets represent different sexual acts. In some variations of the game, a yellow bracelet symbolizes hugging; purple means kissing; blue means oral sex; and red means a lap dance and if someone breaks a bracelet, he or she is entitled to a sexual favor. I, for one, cannot believe this! Its nuts! These kids are like 12 and 13 years old. They’re KIDS! They’ve likened to a modern day form of spin-the-bottle. You know, I hate to admit it, but of the 2 or 3 times I played spin-the-bottle, I always hoped it would never land on me! I hated that game!

      WOW! I am tee-total tired! And yet, well, actually I was going to say something along the lines of: since I've been so busy or since I haven't been able to devote more time to my blogs as of late . . . but truthfully, I just feel like blogging one more time on this lovely November Monday. Amanda is coming over in about an hour to watch wrestling with me and I can't decide if I want to cook or not. To be honest, I really don't   want   to cook, but I don't necessarily want to spend the money on take-out. OK, that's not quite right either. It's really "ordering in" because we all know at this point in the day, I'm not getting dressed again to go outside. My feet hurt. Darn boots.  Nothing too exciting is happening in my life right now. Chris is working, working and I'll get to see him again on Friday - except for the 20 minutes or so I see him during the 4 am hour to rouse him out of bed by scratching his back. Maybe that's why it takes him 4 tries to get up, but probably not. I mean, if I only got 4 hours of sleep a night 5 days a week, it would probably take many tries before I got out of bed. Don't know how he does it.  Berg, our cat, just threw up on the living room carpet. Gee, thanks. Darn hairballs. Which reminds me, but I can't really remember if I blogged about this the other day, anyway, this lady brought her 3-year-old child to a doctor to have a huge hairball removed from the girl's stomach. Turns out that she has that disease that makes you pull your hair out at the roots -  urlLink Trichotillomannia . Kind of crazy - and that was what I was reminded of just then. Thanks Berg! Hopefully someone has learned something today - even if it's only that there is a disease out there for pulling out your hair. Good boy! Down Berg - don't attack. He's such an angry cat. Alright, now I'm heading off to order in some supper. It'll either be pizza or Chinese. Probably Chinese.

      Busy, busy again today. Laurren is back from California! I got her some Gerber daisies and made a sign that said “Welcome Back Laurren,” which I colored with crayons yesterday evening while I was watching JFK. I’m kind of glad that I watched that movie when I did because today I’m watching the Today Show on NBC and they interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald’s brother. Can’t remember exactly what year JFK was assassinated, but it’s getting closer to the anniversary (40 years, I think) so, of course, they’re re-hashing everything. Good movie if you like that sort of thing. I do. Anyway, the weekend went pretty well. On Friday, Chris and I went out to eat at Uno Pizzeria and then watched Matrix Revolutions. Both excellent! We brought our new camcorder along to play with so that we could learn how to use it. On Saturday, we went to Best Buy in Queens and bought like 5 movies along with a carrying case for the new camcorder. Always much fun at Best Buy, but you can’t stay in there too long or Chris will go nuts! On Sunday while Chris worked, I stayed home and did some light cleaning and that was about it. I rested as much as I could since I figured that today would be pretty busy since I have lots of presentation materials to get out this evening. I may be staying late today . . .  Interesting read on ABCnews.com: a British multimillionaire will hand over his infant to a gorilla for a night of baby-sitting. He says that’s kind of how he grew up, only odder. Very strange man indeed and I’ll be surprised if there aren’t any protests, but we can only wait and see. In a story out of Shreveport which I found on CNN.com, it is reported that Southern drawls & accents have thwarted voice recognition systems used to route non-emergency calls. I guess we’re just too complicated for their high-tech systems!!  OK, I must go find something good for lunch today – hopefully something warm instead of just a sandwich or salad. Later kids!

      As I walk down the hallway to get my morning cup of coffee here at work, I feel like I’m on a ship in the high seas. The building is creaking and moaning. Luckily, since I’m an avid watcher of the Discovery Channel, I know the building is supposed to move in high winds.  Keeps the whole things from toppling over.  I would say that I’m not sure what to make of the Senate’s 40-hour talk-a-thon, but realistically, it’s just a big publicity stunt that has wasted time and taxpayer dollars. It all has to do with the approval of Bush-backed judges. According to Senator Rick Santorum, "Never in the history of the United States Senate have we required more than a simple majority to confirm a judge. And now, this year, the Senate Democrats have decided they're going to raise the bar to 60." (courtesy CNN.com) I think that pretty much explains it in a nutshell and I don’t know if I even want to spend more time on this silly little subject, so I won’t.  Not enough time to get into everything I’d like to right now, but we got a new camcorder yesterday. Chris surprised me with it! Good boy!  P.S. Christie, from yesterday's blog, is Chris's cousin. Oh! And Mom is being released from the hospital as I type. Nothing but rest scheduled for her this weekend - and I think she deserves it after all she's been through!

      CONGRATULATIONS! Christie & Bruce Bolton had a little girl: ANNA BELLE BOLTON at around Noon yesterday.  She weighed 7 pounds 14 ounces.  I’ve been a busy little bee here at work lately. Tired as all get out by the end of the day. The only good thing about it is that it makes the day fly by – that and we’ll be getting end of the year bonuses and raises soon, so I’m hoping someone is taking notice of all of my hard work. Mom is doing well and getting better. She’ll either get out of the hospital today or tomorrow. The weather is supposed to be dropping throughout the day today and very windy – gusts up to 60 mph. I guess we have it easy though since Los Angeles is getting pelted with hail and snow. I didn’t know that it even snowed in L.A. What is behind all of this crazy weather?  There’s not a whole lot happening in today’s news – at least that I’ve had time to read anyway. One little tidbit though: the women of Wal-Mart are posing for Playboy. I guess eventually, they’ll also have the women of Target and Brookshire’s.  OK, back to work to make more travel arrangements.

      Another rainy day. Yuk! Good news is that Mom is doing well after her surgery. I’m hoping that they eventually give her solid foods or she might get cranky. I know I would. This morning as I’m trying to get Chris out of bed to go to work, he tells me that I’m being mean to him. However, he didn’t mention how nice I was to him the prior 3 times the alarm went off. I even scratched his back on the 3rd attempt to get him up. I’m a little hurt.  I was reading a story in the Offbeat News section of CNN.com about new protests against Naked Sushi night at a restaurant called Banzai in Seattle. A model wears nothing but a thong and a couple of strategically placed flower petals. Plastic wrap is then placed over her torso and then the sushi is placed on the plastic. This little event takes place once a month at the restaurant. I’m totally sure how I feel about this issue. The protestors argue that this degrades women and will promote violence against women. On the flip side, the restaurant and patrons alike claim that this is a work of art.  Seems that some children in Brooklyn found a US Army issued missile launcher in a trash can in their neighborhood. An adult took it away from them and dropped it off at a police station. Luckily, the thing was inoperable, but could you imagine?!?  Of course, were would we be without the shock of the day: millionaire Robert Durst was found not guilty of murdering 71-year-old Morris Black of Galveston, TX. He actually admitted to killing him, hacking his body up into pieces and then throwing them into Galveston Bay. He then fled from Texas and returned to move the head since he thought it could be used to identify the victim. After doing that, he winds up in Pennsylvania with $500 in his pocket but steals a $5 sandwich. Caught, extradited to Texas and the rest is history. The catch is that the jury was asked to find him guilty or not guilty of murder – and no lesser charge. The defense claims that Durst killed Black in self-defense. The jury agreed. They couldn’t really take into account the actions of Durst after Black was killed only that he died as a result of an accident and it was not intentional. Talk about shock and surprise! Even Durst couldn’t believe it! How often does someone kill someone else, admit to killing them & dismembering the body and get away with it? I mean, I can see how he got off on technicality and to be quite honest, I almost think it was brilliant of his lawyers to take that gamble, but it was just that – a big gamble that ended up paying off.  Oh! And I learned a new term: BIN (booger in nose)

      Mom is going in for a hysterectomy today. About time, too! The only down side is that she won’t be able to do any lifting for about 6 weeks. I’m happy that she’s finally getting this done, but I wish I could be there anyway. I’m not sure if anyone has ever heard of exploding manhole covers. I had never heard of it until earlier this year and living in NYC, many (paranoid) people this it is terrorism related. It’s actually due to a buildup of steam or gas. I’ve never actually seen it happen, but I remember when they started exploding on 5th Avenue once. Today, they’re exploding in Queens, but not where I live. OK, so I’ve moved on to looking for Thanksgiving dinner recipes. I’ve printed out 2 different menus: A Simple Feast for a Small Gathering & Light and Healthy Thanksgiving Dinner. I think I’ll read over both and go with the one that looks least complicated.  Not sure if I ever revisited this piece, but a few days ago, I wrote that there is a new British Royal scandal that has been shrouded in mystery because no one is allowed to divulge any details. Well, the rumor around the mill is that Prince Charles might be bi-sexual or he had a bi-sexual affair with one of his former servants. Of course, this could all be BS and I think it is BS. I’ve been trying to read up on it and it seems that there are so many rumors floating around; seems like the press has been feeding the flames by printing “what ifs” boosting their sales. I just think its funny that there is another British Royal scandal, but no one knows what it is and yet there is all of this denial and lawsuits to block the press from printing it, etc. Crazy!! In other news, at least six Brazilian prisoners suffocated in a sewer after an attempted escape from the Sao Paulo State Penitentiary on Sunday afternoon, the state Security Secretariat said. In all, it is reported that 87 inmates tried to escape. They believe that there are another 7 prisoners who are dead, lost in the myriad of tunnels and pipes.  As part of my job here at Sentinel Real Estate Corp., I work on a fund called SB Partners. Many times people need to re-register an account or they sell their interest in the fund. When that happens and the original holder of the account is deceased, they must supply us with a copy of the death certificate. Interestingly enough, I always seem to find myself looking at the death certificate to see what they died of and how old they were. I got one the other day and the cause of death was “organic brain syndrome.” What? OK, so I’d never heard of this disorder so I turn to the Internet to answer all of my newfound questions. Turns out that this is just a generic term for the things that happen to your body as you get older or by definition “Organic brain syndrome is a general term which refers to physical disorders that cause a decrease in mental function, usually not including psychiatric disorders.”  Examples are degenerative disorders (Huntington’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, etc.), Cardiovascular disorders (stroke, etc.). OK, so the list actually goes on and on, but you get point. It’s basically anything that happens to you when you get old that decreases your mental capabilities. So, by request, on my death certificate, please have them put under cause of death “stopped breathing and she won’t wake up.” That should sum up the problem.  I found a very interesting website for all of you who have ever wondered: Where does my poop go? So check out the link below. It’s kind of a long read, but not too bad and you’ll probably have a few questions answered by the end of the article. Enjoy! http://www.portlandmercury.com/2002-12-24/feature.html  Oh, and thanks Becca! You made me blush a little! I'm very glad our family is so close and we can share in each others joys and sorrow and be there for each other. I love you and can't wait to see you in just over a month!!

      Cacky is safely back in Roxie, MS taking care of her aching and sore husband, John, who was in a car accident this past Saturday night. Luckily, he’s just sore and no more. We had a great time with Cacky during her trip. We went out to eat Friday night and then to an Irish pub for some live music where a homeless/bag man came inside to dance to the rhythm of the night. He made friends with some guys who bought him drinks. Of course, the more he drank, the more he kept trying to go on stage. The bar keep, James, finally had to tell him to either sit or get out. On Saturday, we hit the stores while Chris kept Jackson. Jackson scored 2 video games out of the deal. We were done with shopping around 4:30 pm and then went home to get ready for dinner & the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) later that night. Good times indeed! I’ll be adding the pictures under the Gallery 3 link on our homepage, but for some reason, I was having problems adding pictures this weekend. I’ll try again later.  As far as the stress meter is concerned, things are pretty shaky all around. Just when things seemed to be getting better, we’re hit with another curve ball. I’m hoping we can make it to the end of the game before one team calls forfeit and walks away. Only time will tell at this point.  I’ve been so busy today at work that I really haven’t had a chance to go full throttle at my blog today, so until tomorrow . . .

      This has been the longest 5 days in my entire life!! I’m so glad this week is over! I’m mentally drained from it all. OK, so no harping on the grief for now. I need to be in better spirits. I have a long night ahead of me. It’s harder for me to stay up late on Friday nights because I get up so early to get ready for work. I’m looking forward to that 2nd wind later today. Unfortunately, I won’t get off in time to go to the airport with Chris & Cindy to pick up Cacky. For now, the plans are to meet up around 7 pm at Cindy’s apartment. We’re going out to eat at a place called The Copper Kettle and then we’ll go to Tailor’s Hall for drinks afterwards. I’m sticking to my usual beer regiment so that I won’t puke all day long tomorrow. On Saturday, we’ll go shopping. We’ll end up at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater for a couple of shows later Saturday night. Can’t stay out too late Saturday because Chris has to be at work at 7 am Sunday.   A commuter’s tale: I was on the subway yesterday on my way home from work. The train was packed and I was standing, holding onto a bar. Whoever was driving the train must like to watch people jerk back and forth – that’s the conclusion most of us came to anyway. We were in the tunnel beneath the East River on our way to Queens when we suddenly jerked to a halt. At first, I was still standing and then someone started to fall. It was like this whole domino affect and the lady standing next to me was about 3 times my size. I think I hurt my right kidney. I later slammed into her when the train conduction jerked to a halt again just before Queensboro Plaza. Luckily, everyone was in a good mood and there were no words exchanged, which is a rarity here in the Big Apple.  I’m not even sure exactly what category this next bit falls into, but for weeks, newspapers have declared they know a dark rumor about the British royal family that could bring the monarchy down —but they could not print it because of Britain’s tight libel laws. The bomb finally looked set to go off this week, when the Mail said it was ready to print a 3,000-word scoop based on the testimony of an ex-royal servant — but was blocked at the last minute when another former servant sued. (courtesy of MSNBC.com) So there’s all of this brouhaha of what Prince Charles did, but denies doing, but no one will say what he did or didn’t do. Confusing!! And in Malaysia, the government will restrict the importation or publishing of books judged to be too scary because they could be a bad influence, a minister said. The restrictions would apply to books with elements of mystery, fantasy, the occult and superstition that were "calculated to entertain by frightening" the reader, Deputy Home Minister Chor Chee Heung was quoted as saying Thursday in The Star newspaper. "These materials will create an unhealthy picture on the minds of the readers, and influence them by such far-fetched ghostly stories," Chor was quoted as saying. Turns out that all media is high censored in Malaysia. (courtesy AP)

      Today is a brighter day in many ways! For one, it’s almost Friday, which means that Cacky will be here tomorrow! Chris is off work tomorrow & Saturday. I have a feeling that he’ll be sleeping most of the day tomorrow until we go pick Cacky up from the airport. I hear that the US Mint will be releasing an updated version of the nickel in 2006. The front will stay the same, but the backside will be one of two designs: a handshake or the Lois & Clark longboat. It’s about time the nickel got proper recognition.  On the web: There will be a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday. At the peak, the moon will hang in the night sky like a dark, reddish-orange coal. The eclipse reaches totality at 8:06 p.m. Saturday night, EST. That stage -- when the moon, Earth and sun are lined up precisely and the moon passes through the darkest part of Earth's shadow -- lasts just 24 minutes. (Courtesy of CNN.com) I just read an article about a new reality TV show titled “Can You Be A Porn Star?” with 28 women competing for $100,000 and a contract. It looks like you’ll only be able to watch the show via pay-per-view. It seems people will do anything to get on TV these days!  Weird but True (courtesy New York Post): Canadian biologists puzzled by a mysterious, underwater sound think it could be herrings farting.  “It sounds like a high-pitched raspberry,” said Ben Wilson of the University of British Columbia. Makes me wonder what goldfish sound like . . .

      Well, while things are still chaotic for now, but there is a silver lining and a glimmer of better days to come. All’s well that ends well, isn’t that how it goes? On the work front, Chris is tired working double shifts 5 days a week. I told him again last night (again) that if it’s too much on him, to quit one of the jobs before it starts taking its toll on him. On my job front, we get a pizza party today since they ran us ragged last week getting about 5 presentations out the door. I suddenly feel like I'm back in high school. And this Friday, Cacky is coming to visit for her birthday weekend!! Friday can’t get here fast enough!  Not too many things happening on the web today, but I did find the link below. It will connect you to some ridiculous but true lawsuits from over the years. It’s a quick read and you’ll probably laugh your bootie off or snort on a few of them. Enjoy kids! http://channels.netscape.com/ns/atplay/laughable.jsp?floc=ap-main-1-L1

      And the frustration continues. What good can I do from here? What good would I be if I were there? As it is, I feel like I’m chasing something that doesn’t want to be found to begin with; something that doesn’t want to see or talk to me. I find it strange and discomforting. It’s never quite been like this before. I know things are rough right now and will be rough for a while. Why do I feel like I need to help fix this situation? Human nature, I guess. I obviously can’t do a thing for anyone from here. So I’ve decided to call in some reinforcements. I need someone with more experience, more understanding with words of encouragement & Yaya wisdom. I need someone who has been in rough spots herself. And then all I can do is cut the cord, so to speak, and wait because that’s all I’m really allowed to do from here. Helplessness sucks. It would be so empowering to say that I’d NEVER allow myself to feel this way again, but let’s face it; I didn’t really have a choice in this matter to begin with. Why is it when we’re upset we shut everyone we love out of the picture? Why can’t I be in 2 places at once?  Alas, I cannot help heal the world when it wants to hurt and needs to hurt. All I can do is be here to help pick up the pieces when the time comes to move forward. God, please give us the strength and patience to get through the rough seasons of our lives.  So on a lighter note: In the news: The Defense Dept. has settled a lawsuit with Linda Tripp for $595,000 for a Privacy Act violation. The 1974 Privacy Act prohibits the government from releasing unauthorized personal information about individual Americans to nonfederal organizations. Lucky duck! In hopes of adding excitement to its patrons' nightlife, The Cutting Room, a bar in New York City, is mixing drinks with Nexcite, a Swedish import marketed as an herbal aphrodisiac. I’ll take some libido on the rocks, please! On Netscape.com, I read about 20 kooky ways to save money. Whoever wrote this article is obviously smoking crack.

      There are many things that happen to us in life that we simply don't understand. We don't know why we feel the way we do. We don't know why we look the way we do. Many times, people feel the need to "fix" what they feel is wrong in their lives. And while that isn't a bad thing, it sometimes turns out to be not quite as easy as we expected. Plan A doesn't quite work, but Plan B doesn't really work either. So in the end, you take part of Plan A and part of Plan B and you come up with Plan C. No one said Plan C would be easy. No one said Plan C would be completely pain free and happy and full of rainbows & kittens. Sometimes Plan C hurts and sometimes, it hurts a bit too much. In the end, it may not work at all even though it showed such promise in the beginning. In despair, we try to "fix" it once again. This time, we don't want people to know that Plans A, B, and C didn't work so we tell them everything is fine; "I'm still on Plan A! Everything is A-OK!" But what the masses don't know is that you've secretly been working on Plan D, which turns out worse than all the rest. Only this time, Plan D isn't an easy thing to let go or control. So the masses step in and try to help - try to "fix" things as well. Did they ask to help? Where were they when everything was going so wrong with Plan A and Plan B? Where were they then? How come they didn't put their two cents in when Plan C was in motion? It pisses you off; makes you angry. How dare they try to fix what they don't know! Who said they have the right? But, who says they don't?  At what point in your life and your troubles do you realize that what you've been doing isn't working anymore? What makes that realization an easy one? Where is the guidebook of life that's supposed to explain everything and make this world happy and beautiful once again? Geez! So many questions and so few answers do I have beating down my door. I just want to stand up and scream ENOUGH!! I'M DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT! IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, JUST F**KING SAY IT ALREADY! But then I come back down to reality and I realize that that won't really do anyone any good anyway. Where is my magic wand? Who borrowed it? I want it back! I want puppies and ice cream and rainbows again. I want picnics at that spot on Hwy 165. I want coke floats and to chase butterflies at dusk with a net I made out of an old shirt and a wire clothes hanger. I want to listen to Kenny Rogers in that big ugly brown van again. I want to go skinny-dipping with that boy down the street trying to catch a peek at us doing cartwheels off the side of the pool. I want to go fishing again in the woods behind Mr. Witty's place. I want to go back to Gulf Shores and watch the sun set and then rise and then set again. I want to eat dill pickles at basketball games in that old gym and then sneak back into the music room while no one is watching us. I want to sneak out at night and go into the circle and sit under that tree until we get chilly again. I want to stand in the sand in the Red River while my toes disappear. I want to make slightly pornographic mud pies on the bottom of my red wagon again.  If life were this simple, we would still be 10 years old and riding our bicycles everywhere. Why were in such a hurry to grow up? Make things our own? All I can do now is to make my life what I see in my daydreams. To make life as fun and exciting for my nieces and nephews as it was for me. This is what I have to promise myself. To get myself through the day; through the week; through the month; through the year. Through my life that is now, well, my life. I want to make life fun again and if I can't wave my magic wand and be 10 again, then I can make life fun for them again. That's what matters anyway, right?

      Drama. Not too much drama, but enough to hurt your stomach a little; that’s how my weekend ended and my week started. If I could, I would wave a magic wand and all would be right & good in the world. As it is, I can only sit on my hands, make phone calls (wait for them to call me back) and pray that all will be OK in the end. Even though I’ve been calling to try to help, I think I’m just adding to the stress of the situation. I hate being so far away during these tough times. If only I were rich enough to take off for about a month to help out. Perhaps in my next life . . . And yet I feel so helpless even though I know there’s pretty much nothing I can do from here. I’m frustrated, very, very frustrated.  On a livelier front, Cacky will be coming in this Friday for her birthday weekend in NYC! We have a few activities planned, but nothing too major as Chris will have to go to work early Sunday morning (7 am). We have plans to go out to dinner, an Irish pub, shopping and, of course, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. Everything else is pretty much up in the air.  I would write more, but I’m afraid I’m a bit preoccupied and can’t seem to grab hold of a complete thought, so let’s just make comments on today’s news! I’m sure by now everyone has heard about the California lawyer who was shot at point blank like 5 times. Amazing video! Talk about a disgruntled client! On Sunday, I watched Sean “P Diddy” Combs run the NYC marathon. He ended up raising over $2 million for NYC schools so I can’t really shoot down his efforts as just another publicity stunt. In truth, I like P Diddy – his music and most other of his business ventures. He seems like a stand up guy anyway. And in case you haven’t heard, Minnie Driver (the actress) is planning to work in a Cambodian sweatshop in order to help improve working conditions and pay for people in poor countries. She’s planning to bring a photographer along and they’re hoping to make a documentary or write a book about the ordeal. OK, so now I have to question whether she’s doing this for poor people or poor Minnie.  In case anyone would like more blogs to read, there is one (www.bigwhiteguy.com) in which this Canadian white male who is now living in Hong Kong recounts his adventures of living in a city where the “tax rate is unbeatable” and he sees “things most people on dream of seeing.” This site was featured on CNN and is good to read in case you just don’t have enough to fill your day. Yes, I say live vicariously through the Big White Guy!! Why not? It’s cheaper than going there yourself! Ok, now off to order Chinese food from Chef Ho Dumpling House!!

      Wow! We saw it all last night, I think! We went to a Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden, which was the 1st time any of us had been to MSG. We had a great time but you should have heard some of the comments as we walked through the Times Square subway station on our way to the concert. Chris was a Redneck Alien Trucker and Olivia & I were Angel Sluts. Don't know if that's what we had in mind when we picked out our costumes, but that's what we ended up with. Check out the pictures in Gallery 3 - we saw: a glow worm, cheerleaders, fairies, butterflies, girls scouts, scooby-doo, 80's man, princesses, the Pope, Hawaiian girls (I mean, men), chicken man, the gingerbread man, candy corn, walking Christmas trees, Goth girls, Austin Powers, devils, cat women, stop light girl, TV man, etc. You name it, we probably saw it! Including the guy I spotted in nothing but a speedo. Thankfully, that one wasn't too close to where we were sitting! At one point, I went to the bathroom & Chris went to get beer. I come back from the bathroom & Chris is standing up there placing his order while some girl is trying to kiss him. She liked his Alien Redneck Trucker teeth.  My wings broke just before the end of the concert, but I think I can repair them. My feet were hurting so bad by the end of the night & we ended up walking like 10 blocks from 33rd Street to 42nd Street trying to catch a cab. Never found one! We ended up squeezing onto the 7 train at Bryant Park and taking it into Queens and transferred to the N train. Got home just before 2 am. All in all, good times all around! OK, off to soak my aching feet! And to store my wig & wings until they're needed once more in this City of Dreams.

      I started thinking about the movie Fight Club after an earlier conversation with a co-worker. Then I started thinking about what a Single Serving Friend is. Then I thought about my latest Single Serving Friend. Ernest, I think his name was. I met him on the flight from Atlanta, GA to Alexandria, La. He was going to Natchitoches, coincidentally, to see his daughter, Erica (we'll call her), for her 18th birthday. He began telling me how she didn't finish high school and quit in like either the 9th grade or 11th grade. She now works for a small local fast food joint. My new friend, Ernest, has been trying to convince his daughter to come visit him and his family in either Boston or Germany. A little history: Ernest and this woman were never married and he is now remarried and living in Boston. His new wife is German and they go back to Germany occasionally. Anyway, I was telling him how I'm glad that I got out of Natchitoches for a bit. Even if I eventually ended up there, life is certainly worth the experiences. You can always go back home, but some opportunities won't wait on you.   So I told Ernest how I thought leaving was one of the best things I ever did. Not the easiest, but it has helped my grow in these 2 1/2 short years that I've been here. I certainly enjoy going home and I certainly wish I could be there more often for all of the little things, but what can I do really. I go home as much as I absolutely can. I enjoy every minute of it because I know I have to tell them all goodbye at the airport. Airports make me cry. I'm usually teary-eyed for the first leg of the trip, which is only an hour long. But it's a new year (almost) and new vacation days are coming - except the ones that I "borrowed" to go home for Christmas.  By the way, New Year's is tomorrow night. I am not going to Times Square in case you were wondering. And I know you were. Last year, Chris's parent were here, so it was fun to go out. This year, Chris is working and Cindy has a date. Dick Clark, here I come baby!! It's you and me this year! If I can stay awake that long.

      I watched the Michael Jackson interview where he said that he was manhandled by the police, etc. What can I say really but, ARE YOU CRACKED OUT MICHAEL?!?!? Jeez! I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but the dumbass is lying.  Interestingly enough, M&Ms will phase out color in 2004. The company says that this is an effort to turn over a new leaf and gain market share. In early 2004, the only colors available will be black and white. They will then run a contest 4 or 5 months later reminiscent of the golden ticket from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." They will produce 6 bags of colored M&Ms - all candies in each of the 6 bags will be the same color. One bag each for: yellow, orange, red, green, blue, and brown. Click  urlLink here  to read.  I read an article on Time.com about whether or not the draft should be reinstated. The thing is, with the attacks on the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon, Chris and I had to sit down and have a serious talk about the goings on up here in NYC. At that time, there were many anthrax threats as well as the possibility of smallpox or something like that. I forget now that it's 2 years later.  In the news: Tammy Faye Messner, the ex-wife of televangelist Jim Bakker, says she may pick up some tips on make-up from the male transvestites she'll appear with this Friday. The former Tammy Faye Bakker will host Drag Bingo in Durham , to raise money for the Alliance of AIDS Services Carolina. (courtesy  urlLink WNBC.com )

      So my efforts at trying to post each day of my Christmas vacation failed miserably. Sucks for you, kid. All in all, good times indeed! Indeed. As reported, I held an alligator for the very first time in my life. Not so bad. My flights went well and during my 2 hour layover in Atlanta on the way back, I had an appointment with an endless bowl of chips & salsa from Chili's and a Corona. I ended up buying myself a silver band for my thumb. Momma likes. It was a WONDERFUL Christmas vacation!! I, however, have come to the realization that I cannot spend a holiday as important as Christmas away from Chris.  I've been so out of the loop in the news world that I didn't even know there was an earthquake in Iran or mudslides in Utah, etc. In truth, I couldn't figure out how to work my Dad's satellite TV. I must admit that I'm a little ashamed of myself, too. I'm surrounded by technology and I can't figure out how to watch my favorite channels on satellite. Dumbass.  I found this interesting little website of  urlLink found notes . Neat site. You should visit. And then I found another site for someone who decided to take the whole cell phone matter into his own hands by " urlLink rearranging " it.  And this next one is just about the scariest thing I think I've ever seen.  urlLink Ugly sweaters, really fast .   And for all of you with time on your hands: the  urlLink Michael Jackson  game. OK, so it's kind of lame, but you're the one who's bored. Not me.

      This week has gone by all too quickly and yet I can't wait to get home to see my husband and sleep in my own bed! I've had a great visit back in Louisiana. Santa was good to all! I have 2 nephews here in Natchitoches: 2 1/2 years old & 10 months old. I don't understand how my sister still has an ounce of sanity left in her body. My sister-in-law has 3: 5 years old, 3 years old & a 1 year old - all girls. I don't know how they do it! At times, I feel like I'm ready to have kids until I come to visit some of my nieces & nephews. Then I feel like waiting for another 10 years. They're exhausting, but I love them all! Today, we went out to Campti & Coushatta to see some of my aunts, uncles and cousins. It was so nice when the boys fell asleep in the car on the way back! Well, I guess I'm off again since my sister and her husband just came in. Time for more coffee and some awesome carrot cake made my very own loving mother!! Oh! And we had fried turkey yesterday for Christmas dinner! AWESOME!!

      Ok, so I've been home for about 2 1/2 days and I'm just now able to post. It's been busy so far. I can't comment on any news this time around as I haven't stopped long enough to watch anything on TV. As soon as I landed in Alexandria, La on Saturday, we ate at Cracker Barrel. Then, we drove to Rayville to go see my grandparents and my in-laws. We did a little present swapping, ate some good ole deep-fried chicken and then watched the Blue Collar Comedy Tour starring Jeff Foxworthy. Too funny! My sister-in-law, Cacky, recorded it from Comedy Central one night. Good work, Cacky dahlin, good work! I got all kinds of good stuff for Christmas already and it's only the 22nd!! I just want to point out that I haven't even worn my coat since I landed. It's been in the 50's or 60's during the day. Crazy!! Oh! And I held a couple of alligators just about an hour ago. I took a picture with them, too! Their snouts were taped shut so they wouldn't bite anyone. My little nephew, Bryant, was a little scared of them but he stuck it out for the pics.  This morning, Mom, Dad & I got in the car to go to Shreveport for a little shopping. The car didn't want to start, but Dad coaxed it and it came to life. We took it back to the dealership since they've only had it about a month. Turns out that a rat crawled up in the engine and tried making a nest. It chewed through a few wires, which had to be replaced. Ended up costing about $130 plus tax. And about 2 hours of our time. However, I must say that Moffit Mazda is just the nicest car dealership you could possibly pick. Alright, Dad's making some cheese toast which happens to be an old favorite of mine, so I gotta go. Until next time . . .

      Sorry, boys & girls, for the lag in posts, but we've been dealing with a family situation. I haven't really been surfing the net lately. I haven't really been able to concentrate on one thing. However, Chris and I did manage to clean out our closets last night. Instead of sharing the closets, we've decided that we would each have one closet each to ourselves. I think we're officially a married couple now. For the most part, even though we've been married for over a year (and living together for about 5 years before that), it still feels like we're roommates. But, things are beginning to move toward the other spectrum.   Chris flew out to Louisiana this morning for a funeral. He'll be back in the Big Apple Friday afternoon. We'll have Friday night together and then I fly to Louisiana on Saturday morning for a little Christmas vacation with my family. I'll try to post from there, but if I miss a day or two, we'll all somehow survive, I'm sure. I plan on getting my hair cut and add more blond highlights while I'm down there. It's just cheaper, damn it. It amazes me that quite a few women that I work with spend about $150 on their hair each time they go. And they go very regularly - about every 8 to 10 weeks. Insane!  I've nearly finished my Christmas shopping and I'm very proud of myself, if not a little astonished by my power-shopping ability. If I don't finish buying gifts up here, then I'll have to finish shopping at my old buddy: Pecanland Mall in Monroe, La. I used to work at Deck the Walls (picture frame shop) when I first started college. Great times!! Pecanland has always been good to me. Last time I was home, my mother-in-law (Daisie, we'll call her) and I went through like 6 stores in less than an hour. We're animals! But I must confess, I really can't keep up with her when she's going full steam for some long-term shopping. I don't know how she does it. My Mom used to be the same way. I just haven't shopped with her lately, so I don't know if she's slowed down any yet.   Must send a big shout out to COURT as I was mentioned on her blog the other day. You should definitely read her blog along with the others that I have linked to the right of this post. I wouldn't waste your time. I promise. As a matter of fact, I was inspired in some way or another by each one.  Wow! I've just discovered that you can actually bid on eBay for your very own  urlLink Imaginary Online Girlfriend . What the f*ck?!?The bids range from $3 to $50. I wonder how much I would pull in?

Each copy of "Bhutan: A Visual Odyssey Across the Kingdom," is 5-by-7 feet, 112 pages and costs about $2,000 to produce. Hawley is charging $10,000 to be donated to a charity he founded, Friendly Planet, which has built schools in Cambodia and Bhutan.

      It snowed again today! Of course I decided that I needed to get some shopping done today, so I trekked 15 blocks in the wind and snow down to Steinway Street to buy clothes for my nephews for midnight Mass, which happens to be at 10 pm this year. Huh? Oh well, more important things to ponder these days. Ok, so after the clothes for the boys, I then decided they needed shoes. Cowboy boots for Bryant it is then. Alright, so I trekked the 15 blocks back to my apartment to meet Cindy and Jackson. They were only here for about 30 minutes before Chris called me. "Please don't hate me," he says, "but I left my resignation letter for the Westin at home and I need you to bring it to me. By the way, did you know it was snowing?" OK, so at 3 pm, Cindy & Jackson scooted off and I headed into the city, dropped off the letter, stole a kiss from my man and then hopped on the 7 train and went to Amanda's to help with her holiday cookies. Home by 7 pm to watch WWE Armageddon. Busy day.  Tomorrow is our company's holiday party. I usually end up drinking a bit too much wine at this thing and then dancing my socks off. I plan to stick to beer this year in the hopes of no hangover!! Wish me luck! There's always an after party, which I have yet to make it to. The bad thing about this whole deal is that we have to go to work the next day. Half show up and out of those half, they show up late. I'm surprised they show up at all.  In case I don't get to post tomorrow, I would like to say:    HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD!!          I'm going home to Louisiana this Saturday for a whole week! I'm pretty excited, but I'm exhasted thinking of all the things that still need to get done before I leave. And, I still need to finish getting 11 more Christmas gifts. I'm sure I'll be having a Bloody Mary just as soon as they pull out the beverage cart on the 8 am flight to Atlanta from NYC. By the end of the week, I'll have deserved it twice-fold. Before I hit the publish button, I just wanted to say:   THEY CAPTURED SADDAM HUSSEIN!! FINALLY!!  GO USA!

      Well, I had lunch today at Takashimaya with Dawn and Andrew and I didn't get a chance to post earlier so I emailed it to my home email address.

      Wow! There really isn’t jack shit happening in the news world so far today. Well, a few things, but nothing I’d like to comment on. However, last night, I found the link so that you, too, can get your  urlLink 2004 Horoscope ! Lucky you! So go and find out what the New Year has in store for you!  The 12-year-old boy who accidentally killed a 6-year-old girl three years ago will finally get a new trial. I’m sure you remember this one. His defense said that it was an accident as the boy, Lionel Tate, was trying to mimic wrestling moves he’d seen on TV. He was tried as an adult, found guilty, and has served 3 years of a life sentence without parole. Personally, I don’t think he should have been tried as an adult in the first place and, luckily, they’ll now give him a new trial because the court failed to evaluate his competency before the first trial. Good for him! I just think he really didn’t mean to kill that little girl and he had no idea he could hurt her that bad. Kids that age have no idea what mortality is and all the like. I can’t believe that his attorneys let him be tried as an adult in the first place.  I got a call from my former boss, Walter LaRose, this morning so I wanted to give a shout out to all of my friends in MONROE, LOUISIANA!!

      So yesterday started off a little rough and it ended about the same. After work, I walked the 1 block to the train station, swiped my card, hopped onto the N train that had just pulled into the station when an announcement came over the system: “Due to an earlier stalled train, the N and W trains may or may not be running into Queens. We won’t know anything until we pull into 57th Street. To get to Astoria, Queens, take the downtown train to 42nd Street/Times Square and take the 7 train to Queensboro Plaza and then transfer to the N or W train.” Ok, all well and good except that we sat there for about 10 minutes before everyone started going upstairs, crossed the street, back downstairs to wait on the downtown train platform. I, on the other hand, seized the opportunity to do a little shopping, as I needed to find a pair of pants for our company holiday party. So I did my thing and walked away with 1 pair of black pants with a nice ribbon detail and 1 glittery pink shirt that I’ll probably exchange as I now have pink glitter all over me, still. After my shopping, I went back to the train station on the downtown side. No train. I then walked to Times Square (about 8 blocks) and took the 7 train to Queens. I got to Queensboro Plaza and they announced that all trains were arriving and departing from the upper level to go back into Astoria. Happy, happy, yeah, yeah as I was already on the upper level. Then, to everyone’s chagrin, a train pulled into the lower level and an announcement came over the system, “The train on the lower level will be going back into Astoria.” So hundreds of people were trying to make their way downstairs to get onto the Astoria bound train only to have the train conductor then tell everyone that the next stop on that train was Lexington & 59th Street in Manhattan. Well, F**k that!! Since there were no other trains in sight, I walked home from there, which took me about 10 minutes in my boots. Finally! Home at last!!  OK, then it was time to get on the phone with Verizon’s tech support to try to figure out why we haven’t been able to get online since Saturday. Well, 45 minutes into the call and catching a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel, I got a beep on my phone. It’s Chris, so I flipped over to let him know that I was working with Verizon on our little problem. Oops! I hung up on both Chris and Verizon!!! Son of a B**tch! So I called Verizon back and 30 minutes later, we had Internet!! It was all the router’s fault. Damn router.  And scene.  There is a story on MSNBC.com about an order from the Pentagon barring those nations that were opposed to the Iraq war from bidding on reconstruction contracts in Iraq. I must say that I can both sides of the argument. On the one hand, why should those countries who adamantly opposed the war and who did everything they could to stop it be awarded contracts when they haven’t done the prep work that enables them to safely go into Iraq to rebuild. However, on the other hand, the US doesn’t own Iraq. Who’s to say the Pentagon should get to decide which countries are allowed to bid on contracts. Shouldn’t an order like this technically come from the UN? I’m afraid it all comes down to greed. Luckily, I don’t have to deal directly with this stuff, so I can keep my petty little comments in my blog and the world will be a happier place indeed.

      Before I get into all of the lousy details of my day, let me first say:   HAPPY 29TH BIRTHDAY BOB!!!   Ok, so now I can tell you that I’ve had a hell of night and morning. It started at 12:15 am when Chris came home, dropped his bag off and went upstairs to Sergio’s apartment. Berg meowed at the door for the next 20 minutes. I screamed only 3 times, I think, from the warmth of my bed to SHUT THE HELL UP BERG!! Later, Chris’s alarm starts going off at 4:15 am, which is normal but I’m in such a rotten mood already that I can’t go back to sleep before the alarm goes off again 10 minutes later and then 10 minutes after that. Finally, he gets up at 5 am – again, this is normal. At about 5:25 am, it sounds like someone is hitting our radiator violently with a hammer. While some faint banging is a normal (occasional) occurrence, this sound was very loud. I nearly jumped out of bed. Within 5 minutes, our neighbor, Ms. Gertie, started knocking on all of the doors on the 1st floor to let everyone know that she didn’t have electricity. I finally lay back down only to have to get up to my own alarm at 6 am. Much to my dismay, the lack of Ms. Gertie’s electricity wasn’t the only problem our building was having: no heat and no hot water. Ah, a barely luke-warm shower it is then. Then it’s finally time for my morning cup of coffee only to go cold on me quicker than normal due to our freezing cold apartment. New York City! Ain’t it the life?!?  I just read on MSNBC.com that Ozzy Osbourne had to have emergency surgery after an ATV accident. You can read the story  urlLink here .    Now, what we’ve all been holding our breathes for, the facts on the paper vs. plastic bag saga:  Convenient and Everywhere    Plastic bags were first introduced in 1977 and now account for four out of every five bags handed out at grocery stores.  Americans make 2.3 trips to the grocery store each week. If people use five to 10 bags each time, that's between 600 and 1,200 bags per person per year.   Stores usually pay less than a penny per plastic shopping bag, and 3 to 4 cents per paper shopping bag.   According to the Grocery Industry Committee on Solid Waste, less than 1 percent of shoppers consistently use cloth shopping bags.    Paper or Plastic? You Decide.    Plastic grocery bags consume 40 percent less energy to produce and generate 80 percent less solid waste than paper bags.   Plastic bags can take 5-10 years to decompose. Paper bags take about a month to decompose.   Paper bags are made from trees, which are a renewable resource. Most plastic bags are made from polyethylene, which is made from petroleum, a nonrenewable resource.   Two thousand plastic bags weigh 30 pounds, 2,000 paper bags weigh 280 pounds.   A packed standard-sized paper bag can hold up to 14 items, an average plastic bag often holds 5-10 items.  Research from 2000 shows 20 percent of paper bags were recycled, while 1 percent of plastic bags were recycled. But plastic bag recycling is growing as plastic lumber products become more popular.

      All in all, not a bad weekend. My calves and my right arm still hurt a bit, but they’re getting better. I think I’m weathering falls down stairs better these days. On Friday night, Chris and I braved the snow and 35+ mph winds to go watch The Last Samaria starring Tom Cruise. Excellent movie and I would definitely recommend it to everyone! I made chili this weekend – perfect timing, I think. We had it 3 ways: with cornbread, with cracker, and with Frito Lay corn chips all topped with shredded cheese. Just right, kid, just right.  During filming in a remote area of Italy earlier this year for the controversial Mel Gibson film "The Passion of Christ," the actor who portrays Jesus was struck during a lightning storm, according to an October report in the trade paper Variety.  Also struck was assistant director Jan Michelini, who had been struck by lightning at a previous shoot for the film, in Matera, Italy.  None of the strikes created a serious injury.  The film's portrayals of Christ and of Jews are expected to make it extremely controversial. (courtesy MSNBC.com’s Weird News) I really wanted to see this movie, but after these lightening strikes, I think someone up there might be trying to tell us something about this movie.

      Well, we've just finished moving Sergio from Brooklyn to Queens in the 1st blizzard of 2003. He's moving into the apartment directly above ours. It wasn't too bad as long as you're ready for it. A few layers of clothes and some snow goggles and we're all set, thanks. Our living room radiator is popping and clicking right now. We would normally have it turned off, but it's been a little too cold lately.  Today is the NATCHITOCHES CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL!!! I wish I were there! I hope someone had a funnel cake for me! Mom & Dad opted out of the festival to go Christmas shopping in Shreveport.  Ok, off to take a muscle relaxer and melt into the couch. I didn't overdo the moving until I slipped down the stairs while loading Sergio's things into the new apartment. I didn't fall all the way down since I was hanging from the banister with one arm. Ok, off to melt now.

      They’re predicting 4 to 7 inches of snow here in the city over the next day and a half. Should be interesting to help Sergio move his stuff from Brooklyn to Queens in the snow. They said that it wouldn’t snow until later this evening, but it’s already coming down pretty good. Well, the flu is really kicking some ass this year! I would say that I’m glad I’ve already had my flu shot, but the strain of influenza that is killing people out there isn’t contained in the flu shot they’re handing out. Great! I got that stupid shot for nothing! All that anxiety!  There is a story out of Lafayette, La. about a little boy who received disciplinary action from his school. The mother received a call from her son’s school informing her that he had used foul words. Once she saw the disciplinary form, she got upset because he hadn’t used curse words but told another student what “gay” meant. His own mother is gay and he was explaining what it all meant. The boy was scolded in front of his class, sent to the principal's office, banned from recess and ordered to attend "behavior clinic" after his conversation with the kid. The school says that it is all a misunderstanding and that he’s not being punished for discussing what it is to be gay, but because he was off task from the students’ lesson. Now, the ACLU is involved and is threatening the school with a lawsuit. OK, in my school days, nearly every kid was off task at some point or another. I have a hard time believing that behavior clinic attendance should be required if the issue is simply being off task. Someone’s blowing smoke.  A man in Queens was issued a ticket for too much noise when his son’s balloon popped on the sidewalk. How insane is that? The man says that he’ll fight the ticket in court. I’m afraid I’m on this man’s side on this one.

      So far, today has been a good day. It’s butt-ass cold outside, but what’s new? Chris doesn’t have to work tomorrow and I’m looking forward to his alarm not going off at 4:15 am. On Saturday, we’ll be helping his friend, Sergio, move from Brooklyn to the apartment directly above ours. Should be an interesting arrangement as long as I don’t hear any strange sounds from above.  OK, so I’ve watched Fox’s “The Simple Life” starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie for the last 2 nights. I think my jaw hit the ground after last night’s episode. Their host family secured them jobs at a dairy farm. Now, this is their very first job in their entire lives and they’re going to work on a farm. I knew things would go wrong when they showed up an hour late and Paris carried her Louis Vuitton bag with her to milk the cows. At the end of their workday, they were supposed to fill all of these bottles with milk and seal them for the delivery truck that was on its way. After the owner walked away to tend to other matter, they proceeded to hide half of the empty bottles they were to fill and then they: spilled about half of the milk, added water to some bottles, got dirt in a few, etc. They then disappeared into the dairy farm owner’s home to sleep on his couch. Once he found them, he gently said that he would do better by himself, paid them each $42 for what little they worked and wished them the best in life. I have to hand it to the dairy farm owner because I would have cussed them to no end and then kicked them in their pampered asses. I must say that I thought they would have done better as far as jobs go. Next week’s episode has them working at Sonic where they proceed to put up naughty words on the marquee and then flip off passers by while wearing Sonic food costumes. We’ll see what happens next week.  I’ve also been watching MTV’s “Rich Girls” starring Ally Hilfiger and Jamie Gliecher which, at times, can be just as jaw dropping when you see all of the things they do or can’t do. For instance, if I’m not mistaken, Jamie has someone do her makeup every morning. On the episode I watched last night, Ally was whining and crying to her dad about her childhood and then because she wants to be able to stand on her own 2 feet without her parents help. She then goes grocery shopping for ingredients to make nachos, but has to ask various people in the store what goes on them or what type of cheese to use. I must say that one thing I’ve noticed about these über rich people is that they lie around and nap a lot!  In today’s paper: Five high school students pleaded not guilty yesterday to robbery charges stemming from a monthlong crime spree in which they posed first as female prostitutes and then undercover cops, to rip people off.

      Ok, it’s a long one today because I went home last night and found some interesting things on the Internet, but first, I’d like to make a correction to yesterday’s post. “A Simple Life” starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie is not an MTV production, nor is it showing on MTV. It is showing on the Fox Channel, though it is by the same creators as MTV’s The Real World, Road Rules, etc.  Glow-in-the-Dark pet fish coming soon: The nation's first genetically altered household pet -- a fish that glows in the dark -- is set to begin appearing in stores next month everywhere except perhaps California, the only state with a ban on lab-engineered species. I’m tempted to get one of these fish just to see it glow in the dark, but I’m also afraid that Berg will make a quick dinner out of him regardless of how much it cost me.  An Australian launched the latest accessory for pampered pooches Tuesday -- bottled water in flavors like chicken and corn, liver and bacon, or beef. The purified Dog Plus K-9 water went on sale in pet stores at $2.10 for 1.3 pint plastic bottle. "It's like a sports drink for dogs," said Andrew Larkey who thought up the idea. "Dogs get bored with plain water -- they deserve variety just as much as people."  Larkey plans a similar line of drinks for cats, in roast chicken and pork flavors early next year. People can safely drink it as well, he said, but it probably won't be a hit with humans. "I've actually developed a bit of a taste for it myself, but I think most people's first reaction is to be a little suspicious," he said. He said each bottle also contains half a dog's recommended daily intake of vitamins B1, B3, B5, B6 and C. (courtesy AP newswire) Huh? I would ask who might be crazy enough to buy this BS, but I have a feeling people I actually know might buy this stuff. Scary, kids. Scary.  A new study revealed the U.S. rate of teenage births fell a staggering 31 percent from 1991 to 2002. The rate declined from 62 births per 1,000 girls to 43 per 1,000. The study also contained some revelations on regional and racial differences regarding teenage sexuality and motherhood. New Hampshire had the nation's lowest teen birth rate in 2001, with 21 births per 1,000 girls between ages 15 and 19. The worst was Mississippi, with a teen birth rate more than three times higher, at 67 per 1,000. Interestingly, of the 11 states with the top teen birth rates, all but New Mexico require that abstinence be stressed in sex education. In all, 22 states have such laws. Overall, Southern and Southeastern states had the highest teen birth rates, while New England states, except Rhode Island, had five of the six lowest rates. Other findings included a marked racial difference as to whether girls and boys were equally likely to have sex early in life. Among teens who had sex before age 15, white girls were just as likely as boys to have sex. But black or Hispanic girls were less than half as likely as black or Hispanic males to do so. Hispanics had the highest teen birth rates, with nearly three times more than the 30 per 1,000 reported for whites. (courtesy NYPost.com)  FOOD FACTS & FICTIONS (courtesy NYPost.com) Just in time for the holiday season of stuffing your face!  MYTH: If you eat late at night, the food turns straight into fat.  FACT: It's how many calories you eat - not when you eat them - that counts. MYTH: Foods like grapefruit, celery or ice-cold water can burn fat and calories.  FACT: No food can burn fat. (If only!) MYTH: Raw vegetables are better than cooked.  FACT: Cooking carrots and tomatoes helps to release cancer-fighting substances called carotenoids and lycopenes, so the body can absorb them more easily.  In fact, packaged, heat-processed tomato products such as spaghetti sauce can deliver six times more lycopene than the equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes, according to the American Dietetic Association.  What's more, some beans such as red kidney beans contain natural toxins, which can cause diarrhea if the beans aren't cooked properly. Boiling them for 20 minutes makes the food safe to eat.  MYTH: Boiling vegetables is better than microwaving them.  FACT: The longer you cook your food, the more nutrients it can lose. MYTH: Cravings are your body's way of telling you it needs something.  FACT: You wish.  Chances are, you're craving the pleasure and comfort you feel when you eat those foods - not a specific nutrient in them. MYTH: Any type of water is always better than soda.  FACT: Although regular water is calorie-free, some trendy vitamin waters contain as many as 100 to 125 calories per bottle.  Keep in mind that a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola carries 140 calories.  MYTH: Food labeled low-carb means it's healthy.  FACT: Check the label: There's no governmental standard for low-carb the way there is for low-fat or organic, and even if a product touts that it's low in carbs, it may be packing in the calories. MYTH: Vegetarian meals are healthier than meat dishes.  FACT: To compensate for lack of flavor, some meat-free dishes are loaded with sodium, fat and calories. MYTH: Nuts are evil and should be avoided if you want to lose weight.  FACT: Although nuts are high in calories and fat, most varieties have low amounts of saturated fat, which is linked to an increased risk of heart disease.  They're also a good source of protein and have no cholesterol.  Lingerie becomes anti-drug weapon: They have tried aerial assaults and stiff jail sentences. Now Colombian officials have a new and unlikely weapon to combat the cocaine trade: push-up bras and thongs. Some 900 peasant women in Colombia are set to make racy lingerie and sell it to French supermarket chain Carrefour under a U.N.-backed program aimed at encouraging impoverished farmers and their families to stop growing drug crops. (courtesy MSNBC.com) I wonder if they get to keep any of the articles that they make? But then their problem might not be drugs but birth control. Oh well.

      It’s another beautiful December day! Olivia, who I work with, baked a cartload of sweets and brought half of it to the office. She even placed them in individual cellophane wrappers. And everything is wonderful! But she says that she’s done with her baking until Valentine’s Day. She made brownies, biscotti, cookies, candies . . . Amazing!!  “The Simple Life,” an MTV reality show featuring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie is set to debut tonight. The show is about these 2 rich and somewhat spoiled girls being dropped in the middle of rural Arkansas to live with a family. In the beginning, I don’t think the girls are told exactly what their living conditions will be. I think it’ll be fun to watch them adjust and to see some of their reactions to being asked to pluck a chicken or “checking” the cows. I know most people know what this means, but if not, it involves one of your arms, a long plastic sleeve to slip your arm into, and a cow’s rectum. Good times!  And for all the men in our lives: DaimlerChrysler's Dodge unit is sponsoring a pay-per-view "Lingerie Bowl" during halftime of the Super Bowl on Feb. 1 featuring models dressed in lingerie playing a seven-on-seven tackle football game. The show will cost viewers $30. The teams will be coached by former NFL stars Lawrence Taylor and Eric Dickerson. (courtesy CNN.com)  P.S. IT’S SNOWING AGAIN!!!! Flurries all week and nothing sticks, but IT’S SNOWING AGAIN!! OK, it quit snowing.

      December 1st – what a lovely day! Well, kind of. It started off sunny and bright and then turned strangely overcast and gray. Now it is just cloudy and looks like it might rain later.  Ideally, it’s time to do some holiday shopping but it looks like I’ll have to wait until when (or if) I receive a holiday bonus. And if it happens like last year, that means that I’ll have a whopping 2 days to shop before I have to stuff it all in my luggage and hop on the plane bound for the South. I think I’m up to the challenge as long as I’m not sick during those 2 days. I recall a mere 2 years ago when I received my holiday bonus. As soon as I got off work, I hopped on a downtown train and picked up my wedding dress & tiara from the shop. I remember carrying it back onto the train and getting somewhat strange looks. I guess most people would have taken a taxi home that day, but what can I say? I was broke – I’d just spent every last penny I had on that dress. I think it’s balled up in some room at Mom’s house now. And since the wedding is now just a memory, I’ve decided on a new use for my tiara: I will wear it on each birthday from here on out (once I get it back from Mom & Dad’s house). If only I had it today . . .  Ok, not much happening in the news, but I pulled this from the web word for word, so don’t go charging me with plagerism: A particularly curious statement by U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s at a press briefing won him an unexpected honor on Monday. Rumsfeld, usually renowned for his uncompromising tough talking, was awarded the “Foot in Mouth” award for a baffling message which probably left his audience in the dark, Britain’s Plain English Campaign said. “Reports that say something hasn’t happened are interesting to me, because as we know, there are known unknowns; there things we know we know,” Rumsfeld told the briefing. “We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know.” (courtesy MSNBC.com)

      Last night, some girls from work & I went to eat at Noche for Restaurant Week. [Sidenote: Restaurant Week is a week (or in this case, 2 weeks) when many of NYC's top restaurants offer fantastic meals for a low price. Since it is now 2004, the lunch price is $20.04. Last year (2003), the price was $20.03.]  So, we go to Noche and have a lovely time. The food was OK; nothing to write home about. The place itself was spectacular and the service was fantastic! Pretty good time. Then, 3 of us (Abigail, Olivia & me) went to a farewell party for another co-worker at a bar/restaurant called Eamon's on 45th Street. Cozy little spot - very nice. I did a shot jagermeister, which I haven't done since about my senior year in high school. It tastes as awful as I can remember. Funny, when I took the shot, I remembered sitting around the kitchen table at Allison O'Con's in Natchitoches with a few other girls. We were all standing around taking turns taking shots of jagermeister before we went out for the night. I can remember riding in Allison's car, but I cannot for the life of me remember where we went that night. Oh, well, I guess. Couldn't have been too many places - it being Natchitoches and all.  Otherwise, not too much happening. Chris is making his famous Open N-train Sandwiches that totally rock! 2 sandwiches: 1 ham and the other roast beef. Spicy brown mustard, mozzerella cheese, Swiss cheese, plum tomatoes. Baked open face until all the cheese melts. FANTASTIC!! Ok, gotta go eat!!

      My cat is evil. There's no other explanation. He must hate me and, now, I severely dislike him. If it weren't snowing last night, I might have thrown him outside. He woke me up at 2:30 am scratching on some boxes that we have set aside for Salvation Army to pick up on Saturday. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Spray, spray, spray with the water bottle. Doesn't really deter him much. He just hides behind the bedroom door and waits for me to lie back down and then starts all over again. My friend, Olivia, suggested a bitter apple spray they carry at the pet store. I'm all for it, let me tell you. He kept me awake for an hour last night. I had just enough time to fall asleep and wake right back up to Chris's alarm at 4:30 am. Fantastic.   On the other hand, it snowed overnight. Boy, did it ever! New York City covered in snow - it's a beautiful sight. At first. As long as you remember not to stand too close to the buildings. Melting snow/falling ice from 50-odd stories up scares the hell out of you if you're not expecting it. It's also startling when it smashes into the windows of the 36th floor on its descent.

      Though yesterday ended better than it started off, I'm back in my dreary mood today. (You would have known all about that already if my stupid email hadn't gotten lost along the way) But luckily, I was finally able to access one of my favorite blogs:  urlLink becca.oooo-caliente . Due to our company firewall, it wasn't letting me view her site, but thanks to some karmic slip - I'M IN!! Woo hoo!! I've missed her blog! Thankfully, I'm still able to access blogs for Court & Oz, so I'm up to date on their happenings in France & London, respectively. Now if only I could get to BigWhiteGuy from work.  Well, I've decided that I would've never made it if I lived in Mauritana back in the day: Obesity is so revered among Mauritania's white Moor Arab population that the young girls are sometimes force-fed to obtain a weight the government has described as "life-threatening". (courtesy  urlLink BBCnews.com ) I still weigh the same as I did when I graduated high school, so I'm afraid that I would have been kicked and spit on - and very poor. Thank goodness we live in a society that idolizes skinny bitches!  Wow! It's snowing! It stopped. It's snowing again! And it stopped again. Make up your mind Mother Nature!! I'll have to change the beat of the music playing in my head to keep up with the changing weather. (from Norah Jones to Black Eyed Peas) OK, now where were we? Oh! This past weekend, Chris bought me How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. It's so nice that he thought about me! Especially when he bought himself 4 more DVDs. Well, at least he thought about me. Point is, it's a really good movie and I so wish my life here in NYC was more like that: parties every night, flexible work hours, great clothes, Knicks tickets, diamonds the size of brussel sprouts dangling from my neck . . . Ah! Tis the life!!  Interesting website that I got off of Oz's blog. Check out  urlLink FactCheck.org  if you've ever questioned claims made by any and all political bigwigs.

      So we all know the pros and cons of Bush's State of the Union Address last night, right? Right. Why is it that politics can get people so fired up and that they feel the need to try to make me see their point of view? I used to be interested in doing something political. I remember going to the State Capital in Baton Rouge on a class field trip and loving it. Dreamed of one day working in that grand ole building. I don't know, one day I think it would once again be fun to work in the Capital, but I just can't stand all of the BS that goes along with it.   It looks like Louisiana's wetlands will have a new spokesman:  urlLink SNL's Mr. Bill . The effort to save Louisiana's eroding coast is about to get a new catchphrase: "Ohh nooo!!!"

Excerpts from the  urlLink Northwestern State University crime blotter  in Natchitoches, Louisiana.  Just goes to show you that not much is happening. (courtesy currentsauce.com)   12-11-03   6:40 p.m.  A student from Rapides called and complained that residents were smoking marijuana in a room on the 4th floor of the south hall. The room was unoccupied, but it was speculated that students were using the room to do drugs. A statement was taken from the RA, and no drug paraphernalia was found at that time.   10:11 p.m.  Two NSU students were caught engaging in "extracurricular" activities inside their car in the tennis court parking lot. They were advised of university policies and left campus.    12-12-03   10:49 a.m.  A call was made from the Columns regarding a young man in possession of a gun removing the weapon from the couch and proceeding to take it in to his bedroom.    12-13-03   12:04 p.m.  A wreck on Tarlton Dr. did not result in any serious injuries, but one victim was transported to the Natchitoches Parish Hospital by request.   3:18 p.m.  A female tried to run over a male at the light on College and Caspari in front of the flower shop.   12-14-03  2:53 a.m.  The TKE's were told to leave their house.   5:21 p.m  An Iberville worker called to report students having a food fight.

      Nice long weekend. I needed it. On Saturday, Chris & I went to Down the Hatch with Olivia, Michael, Derrick, Anne & Caroline. $18, about 10 or 12 pitchers of beer later & too many hot wings to count, we left Down the Hatch and took in the 9 pm show at the UCB. Pictures from our outing are in the Gallery 4 album. My stomach did NOT like me the next day! Nothing too exciting as the sidewalks are too iced over to really go anywhere, though Amanda & I did go to Home Depot this morning. I nearly killed myself on the commute. And then I did laundry. I lost count how many times I nearly busted it.  Just in time, the  urlLink State of the Union drinking game !  OK, this next link is just bizarre.

      New York City is so pretty all covered in snow. It's so very cold outside. They say that you can get frostbite in just 8 minutes of exposure. I believe them! I had my leather gloves on and my fingers were so frozen. And while I'm enjoying watching the white stuff coming down, I know in the next day or so, it will all turn to solid, packed ice that forms a sheet over all of the sidewalks. What mounds of snow are left at that point will be dirty brown or yellow. Ah, snow!   At around 2:30 pm yesterday, I went downstairs to  urlLink Au Bon Pain  to get a cup of coffee. My friend (and co-worker), Laurren, went with me and talked me into getting this devilish little pastry called a crème la fleur, which has cream cheese on top and inside of it. We split it and it was gone in a flash! Yum-scrum-delicious!  Now, it's Friday morning and it's 4 degress outside. I feel a sick day coming on. My boss called out yesterday saying it was too cold for him. I second that motion. As soon as I dry my hair, I'm getting back into bed with Chris.  I've stumbled upon another little blog written by fellow New Yorkers. Check it out by clicking  urlLink here . These people are really funny and I know you'll get a kick out of it.  In the news: a  urlLink watchdog group  has deemed the US military partially responsible in the deaths of two journalists killed at a Baghdad hotel during the Iraq war.  Wow!

      Today isn't as cold as it was this weekend (36 today). Thank you God! Unfortunately, it will get cold again this Wednesday. Darn. In order to keep our apartment at a comfortable temperature, I have to close off the bedroom to save heat. On top of that, I keep hearing a noise in our walls that sounds like something is falling. I think it's the plaster from an apartment above ours (I blame it on Sergio). I hope the whole thing doesn't come crashing down on top of us one day. That would suck a big one. Chris and I cleaned out our front closet last night. It used to have 15 boxes of things we've been lugging around from apartment to apartment without anywhere to display. We threw out most of it. We set aside 3 boxes of "stuff" and 2 bags of clothes to go to Goodwill. Now there are only 5 boxes left in that closet. It's so nice! Next weekend, we're doing the middle closet - only 3 boxes. I blame it on TLC's Clean Sweep marathon that ran on New Year's Day.  By the way, if you'd like to see a very clear picture of Chris's red fleur-de-lis tattoo, go to   and then click on the Tattoo & Press link on the left and then click on the Color Work link on the right. Chris's should be the first one up (he got it in July 2003). Hard to miss. It's a big red fleur-de-lis. If you're in NYC and thinking about getting a tattoo, I highly recommend Pon. His work is amazing! And he's worth every penny. And, no, it doesn't hurt a bit. And if you believe that, you're a dumbass. I have a 4x3 inch black shaded fleur-de-lis in the lower middle of my back. I got it on my 23rd birthday. Hurt like hell.  Today, Kathleen Blanco was sworn in as Louisiana's first woman governor. She took the oath in both English and French.   It seems that Martha Stewart is posting about her trials and tribulations on her website www.marthatalks.com  .  Now, I wasn't planning to comment on this story and yet, I really couldn't pass it up. This guy in Germany posted an ad on the Internet seeking someone who was willing to be killed and eaten. One such man replied to the ad. The only thing, according to his partner, is that he "never expressed any desire to die." However, according to Mr. Cannibal, he "wanted to be stabbed to death after drinking a bottle of cold medicine to lose consciousness." (courtesy CNN.com) Hmmm. It would appear we have a conflict of interest in this case. Mr. Cannibal was interested in eating willing participants, but Mr. Victim was only interested in being slaughtered after Robotripping. (see my previous posts about robotripping)  On this day in 1915: The US House of Representatives rejected a proposal to give women the right to vote. (courtesy NYTimes.com)

      It's 10 degrees this morning. 8 below with the wind chill. Why, God, why? That settles it - I'm putting off Bed Bath & Beyond until midweek or next weekend. Chris & I went to see Big Fish last night and I nearly froze on the walk back home. My earrings simply attracted the cold to the inside of my poor ears. Chris had to go to work this morning and I don't think the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental is heated very well. Poor thing must have 2 or 3 layers on today.

      We're finally doing our gift exchange with Cindy & Jackson today. We got Cindy a DVD player and a movie. We got Jackson a move, a game for his Game Boy Advance, a kit for his Game Boy Advance with: a magnifier, cleaner, case, extra battery. While we were at Best Buy last night, we (of course) got ourselves 4 more DVDs to add to our ever-growing collection. Last night's choices were: Underworld, American Wedding (the unrated version), Alex & Emma (my choice), and XMen 2.  I read on WNBC.com that a man fell asleep on the E train and woke up with a steak knife sticking out of his chest. Holy Crap!! I will NEVER fall asleep on the subway!! Not that I've ever been able to. And then I read a story about a couple of pranksters who tapped into the frequency used by a local Burger King speaker that is used when ordering in the drive-thru lane. When someone orders a whopper, for instance, they yell at the customer and tell them they are too fat and to pull up to the window. Though these guys are cussing at customers, I must admit that it's a little funny. Who would have thought of tapping into the speaker's frequency?   And now, a littly funny: 20 Clues A Woman Should Call It A Night  1. I have absolutely no idea where my purse is. 2. I believe that dancing with my arms overhead and wiggling my butt while yelling WOO-HOO is truly the sexiest dance move around. 3. I've suddenly decided I want to kick someone's ass and honestly believe I could do it too. 4. In my last trip to "pee" I realize I now look more like Tammy Faye Baker than the goddess I was just four hours ago. 5. I drop my 3:00 am. submarine on the floor (which I'm eating even though I'm not the least bit hungry), pick it up and carry on eating it. 6. I start crying and telling everyone I see that I love them sooooo much. 7. There are less than three hours before I'm due to start work. 8. I've found a deeper/spiritual side to the geek sitting next to me. 9. The man I'm flirting with used to be my 5th grade teacher. 10. The urge to take off articles of clothing, stand on a table and sing or dance becomes strangely overwhelming. 11. My eyes just don't seem to want to stay open on their own so I keep them half closed and think it looks exotically sexy. 12. I've suddenly taken up smoking and become really good at it. 13. I yell at the bartender, who (I think) cheated me by giving me just lemonade, but that's just because I can no longer taste the gin. 14. I think I'm in bed, but my pillow feels strangely like the kitchen floor. 15. I start every conversation with a booming, "DON'T take this the WRONG WAY but.." 16. I fail to notice that the toilet lid's down when I sit on it. 17. My hugs begin to resemble wrestling takedown moves. 18. I'm tired so I just sit on the floor (wherever I happen to be standing) and take a quick nap. 19. I begin leaving the buttons open on my button fly pants to cut down on the time I'm in the bathroom away from my drink. 20. I take my shoes off because I believe it's their fault that I'm having problems walking straight.

      Chris and I have decided to work on taking a vacation for ourselves at some point this year. This means that we may not make it home as much during 2004, but since we've yet to take our honeymoon then I'm OK with being a little selfish this time around. Where, you ask? Well, the list is building and so far, we have: the  urlLink Cayman Islands , Jamaica, Costa Rica, Portugal, and the list is growing.   Interesting bit: A painting by artist  urlLink Scott LoBaido  depicts Bush holding Bin Laden's severed head and the American flag in the other hand.  I read a story on the  urlLink AP newswire  where this guy wrapped his friend's apartment completely in foil while he was away on trip to LA. Absolutely hilarious and I'm now plotting to do something similar when I get the chance! Watch out kids! You could be next!  Top 10 Hollywood Money Makers: 1. Jim Carey 2. Nicole Kidman 3. Jack Nicholson 4. Tom Cruise 5. Julia Roberts 6. Johnny Depp 7. Russell Crowe 8. Tom Hanks 9. Will Ferrell 10. Renee Zellweger

      18 degrees this morning. 18. Oh, and then there's the wind, which drops the temp down to like 9 degrees. 25 for the high today. Otherwise, not that bad of a day. Yesterday was Chris's first day back to work since he resigned from The Westin. The Mandarin Oriental (his new job) gave him 2 days off paid as a Christmas present, which he took this past Sunday and Monday. He has one more day coming as his New Year's gift, which he'll take sometime next week. While it is nice having him home, he's a loud person. Please don't feel like I'm talking behind his back. I've already told him all of this to his face and he agrees that he likes to make plenty of noise. He even whispers loudly.   Now onto the subject of Berg. Berg has a reputation among our friends here in NYC and he was quite the legend in Monroe as well. (We used to have people drop by who had never come by before and the first thing they wanted to do was meet Berg because they'd heard all about him.) If you'd like to see a picture of him, click on the Galleries 1&2 link on the left. He's 15 pounds of pure evil with claws and teeth. He's very protective of the front hallway for some reason and hates the guys who deliver our groceries. He won't let Amanda and me play a decent game of gin rummy due to his desire to lie down on our cards just as the game gets underway. When Olivia stays over, she's scared to go to the bathroom during the night. Anyway, for the last few nights he has woken me up by scratching on our mattress or playing with a shopping bag. I now keep the water bottle next to me at night and my aim has gotten better with my left hand.  Not too much happening the news world today. Hugh Heffner wants Britney Spears in Playboy. Not that that is really news to me. Every guy in the US wants to see Britney in Playboy. I'm sure that would be the hottest selling issue ever.

      I read a story on MSNBC.com today about a growing trend among teens: getting high from cough medicine, aka Dexing or Robotripping. I don't think this an entirely new concept as I remember it coming into fashion when I graduated from high school in 1996. It is their cough suppressant, dextromethorphan, or DXM, which kids are after. In large doses, DXM can cause hallucinations, heart problems, and a zombie-like state. Sounds like fun, right? Not to mention that wonderful cherry flavor. Unless of course your hardcore and go for the original flavor.  Oh, a little word of advice if you're ever walking around the streets of Manhattan and someone approaches you about your hair. These people are selling packages that are supposed to include services such as: haircut, massaging shampoo, deep conditioning treatment, head massage, facial, etc. The package costs around $60 and then there is an additional $10 service fee that you only pay the 1st time. So, they swipe your credit card right then and there and hand you all of your information. Then you make your appointment with the hair salon and let them know what services you'd like to schedule. Like a dumbass, I did this in March 2003. For all of the "free services" included in my $60 package, it ended up costing me another $150 not including tip. The whole time I was in the salon, these 2 guys were fighting back behind me and had to be pulled apart from each other several times. Since that splendid event, I've been approached another 2 or 3 times. I just look at them and yell, "IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY AND I'LL NEVER MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN!!" Then I run.

      Get ready everyone, I feel the need to jump atop my soapbox: Some of these people that I work with really freaking irk me! Let's take the issue of covering the phones as an example. There are 7 assistants sitting along my row. Of all 7, the 2 whose bosses needed the phones covered until 5 pm on days before & after holidays, well, these are the 2 who either skipped out early or just didn't show up at all. Alright, that's all I can really say about that even though I'd love to go into a rant, but alas, people I work with occasionally read my blog and I must keep things nice and rosy. Peachy f*cking keen. Not to mention those who rudely interrupt me while I'm talking and act as if they've done nothing wrong and I'm just sitting here twiddling my thumbs waiting for them to come and talk to me. (Example #2) Oh, and THE PRINCESS! (Example #3) Her voice will forever grate on my nerves as she retells each story 3 or 4 times or the way she keeps interrupting to ask questions when someone else is talking. You totally lose the point of the f*cking story! Anal! Anal! Anal! Anal! Ok, time to carefully step off the soapbox so I don't fall and kill myself.  So, in today's news: Wisconsin town rings in New Year with  urlLink toilet bowl parade  complete with a giant throne and plunger scepters. (courtesy ABCnews.com)  Oh, and in case you haven't already heard, Britney Spears is now working to annul her new marriage to her lifelong friend from Kentwood, La. She says it all began as a joke that went too far. I think it probably all began with too much alcohol. Well, at least some guy back in Kentwood can claim that he's been married to Britney. Even if it was for only 24 hours or however long it took them to sober up.  And then there's the case of the Crocodile Hunter who went to work feeding hungry crocodiles with his 1-month-old son held next to his side. Maybe I'm wrong (and I don't mean to bring up MJ again), but I'm more worried about MJ dropping his child off a balcony than I am about the Crocodile Hunter bringing his kid to work with him. Oh yeah, the Crocodile Hunter is upset about the connection made between MJ and himself.  From News of the Weird: * In October, San Francisco artist Jonathon Keats, 32, registered his brain as a sculpture and began selling futures contracts on its six billion neurons, offering buyers the rights to any creative products it might produce if science learns how to keep it alive after his death. He also wrote a prospectus for investors, with MRI scans showing the idea-fertility of various brain areas. For now, he is selling inexpensive options ($10) to buy a million neurons for $10,000 when he dies; he sold 71 the first day.  * California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante (runner-up to Arnold Schwarzenegger in the October recall election) is not the family's only public figure. As the San Francisco Chronicle reported in September, his sister Nao Bustamante, 39, is a prominent performance artist whose work includes (1) wearing a strap-on burrito for men to kneel before and bite in order to absolve themselves of "500 years of white man's guilt" and (2) sticking her head into a plastic bag filled with water and tying it around her neck to resemble a Houdini stunt, to create "an urgent situation to respond to."  From Smiley Anders from the  urlLink Baton Rouge Advocate : Giving 'em hell: LeRoy tells of the time Boudreaux was showing Thibodeaux around his new neighborhood when they came upon two beautiful churches directly across the street from each other. Thibodeaux asked why there were two churches so close together and Boudreaux explained that they had different beliefs. He explained it this way: "The church on the left says there ain't no hell, and the church on the right says the hell there ain't."

      Chris and I watched Cold Mountain last night. All in all, a good movie. Neither of us like the ending and I think he cursed it the entire walk home. For some reason, I'm just not a big fan of Nicole Kidman. I think she's a very talented actress, hence all the awards, but she just irks me. Can't explain it. Maybe she's just too perfect or something. There was a girl that I graduated with who was the same way. Damn all you perfect people.  Chris has been playing his new video game Prince of Persia. It is by far the most awesome video game I've seen yet. You can control time and run up walls. Amazing graphics! Though he did have to break down and get the game guide because he got stuck. This game is so full of puzzles and riddles. Kickass game!  Well, it appears that Britney Spears has tied the knot: Pop star  urlLink Britney Spears  marched down the aisle in Las Vegas on Saturday, marrying a childhood friend from Louisiana, according to news reports. (courtesy AP news)  A friend of mine sent me this website for some unique greeting cards, Sugarqube. While it costs about $10 for a year subscription, it's free to sample them all. So check it out by clicking  urlLink here .  OK, it's time to wake up Chris so we can go do 2 weeks worth of laundry. Luckily, the Sugar Bowl game doesn't happen until 8 pm local time so I won't miss out on any of the action. GO TIGERS!!

      I can no longer post during my lunch hour from work, so my posts will now be more sporadic. Also, Chris now only holds 1 full-time job and is off in the evenings and on Fridays & Saturdays, so there's a chance I'll be a little more distracted than normal. On the other hand, I'm really happy to have all of this new-found time with him. I just hope I don't get tired of him!  A new reality TV series will soon air: Reality TV is about to meet flight delays, singing flight attendants and passengers too large to squeeze between the armrests when a program on  urlLink Southwest Airlines  Inc. takes to the air on Monday.

      HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!  This year, I spent New Year's Eve with Jackson, my 8-year-old nephew who also lives in Queens. We played video games (Sly Cooper) and then watched The Hulk. Uncle Chris made it home (via taxi) about 20 minutes before midnight so we got to ring in 2004 all together.  Sadly enough, before all of the festivities started, Chris called me to let me know that if "something" were to happen, he would find his way home. I then reminded him that it took about an hour and a half to walk from Rockefeller Center across the Queensboro Bridge to our apartment. He said that if it was a real emergency, he would probably make it here in about an hour. Showoff. It just goes to show you the kind of things we have to think about in this day and age. After that little conversation, I was sure glad that Jackson was coming over to take my mind off things! After I picked Jackson up and on our way home, we stopped for some ice cream and then we had corn dogs for our big meal! We sure know how to party!  I hope everyone had great fun in whatever you did to ring in the new year! Here's to 2004! May your hangovers be kind!

      !!!HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAY RUTHIE!!!  (My mother-in-law or Daisie as we like call her)  I didn't blog yesterday after work because Olivia, Chris & I went to see  The Passion of the Christ  and I certainly recommend watching it.  It was bloody & gory, but not overly done.  It may make you reflect a bit, but why shouldn't it?  I don't want to give away the movie, so I'll try to wait to post about it.  I was supposed to go to the movies with Amanda today, but we were late getting there and it was sold out before we could make it halfway through the line at the boxoffice.  We're trying again tomorrow at 3:30 pm and I've already reserved tickets on  urlLink Fandango .  If you live in a smaller city, you might not need Fandango, but on an opening weekend for one of the most hyped-up movies of all times in NYC, Fandango is a necessity.  Since Amanda & I didn't go to the movies, we went shopping.  She had never been to Steinway Street here in Astoria. (She lives in Sunnyside)  Steinway has all of the shops: Express, Victoria Secret, Gap, Gap Kids, The Children's Shop, Foot Locker, Modell's, Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc.  I'm surprised that I didn't spend more than I did - I'm very proud of myself.  We stopped by the party supply store and I bought myself some purple feathers and a glue gun.  This guy at work keeps stealing my pens, so I'm going to decorate my pen with feathers and see if he steals it again.  Chris played paintball today with some of his friends.  On the way out of the city, a city bus sideswipped their car and then took off.  A second car was following the car Chris was in and they flagged down the bus.  Not sure what all happened with that.  They still played paintball even though some of their backs were hurting.  He called just after 5pm from Hooters; I guess they're not hurting too bad.   Saturday's Links  Cool link for you:   urlLink The Man Project .  Not that you can very much with it, but it is so very cool.  Funky (and funny) album covers from yesteryear -  urlLink click here .  What were they thinking?  And why live your day when you can simulate it?  Click  urlLink here .  Awesome, isn't it?  I had 2 bowls of cereal - since it's simulated, I don't have to worry about simulated weight gain, now do I?  And I also drove fast since I don't have to worry about any simulated cops giving me simulated tickets.  OK, must hop off the computer so Chris can download pictures from today's festivities.  Hopefully back later . . .

      Damn our IT department!!  They keeping blocking my posts that I email to myself from work.  Damn them.  Anyway, on Tuesday night, Chris and I met up with 3 others that he worked with at The Essex House: Burn, Ana & Michael.  We had dinner at Peter Luger's Steakhouse in Brooklyn.  This place is well known in these parts for being an incredible place and I must second that, but let me tell you about the adventure we had the other night.  7:35 pm-Burn meets Chris & me on the corner on the way to the subway. 7:45-we're sitting on the subway going into Manhattan where we transfer to the J train at Canal Street. 8:20-sitting on the J train going over the bridge into Brooklyn (the train goes above the river here because the bedrock is too deep; nice view of the city). 8:40-we finally make it to Peter Luger's after walking about 3 blocks from the train; meet Ana & Michael. 8:45 pm-this is our reservation time, which we spend crammed in the bar along with everyone else who has made reservations tonight.  Have some beer and duck when the waiters come by with trays of steaming, hot, sizzling steaks & shrimp (we were starving when we left the apt). 9:30-we finally get seated at our table and have dinner: boiled shrimp, tomatoes & onions, rare & med-rare steaks, German fries, creamed spinach, hot fudge sunday, cheesecake.  Damn, there went the diet. 11:20-leave Peter Luger's and try to find a cab.  There are none, so we walk back to the subway happy, drunk and slipping quietly into a steak coma. 11:30pm-hop on the subway which isn't going into Manhattan, but back one stop into Brooklyn where we transfer to go into Manhattan. 11:45-get off the first strain, transfer to another train (F train) because that one wasn't going any further due to construction. Go in the wrong direction - only 1 stop - turn around and go the right way.  We're rocking now!  Unfortunately, we passed Union Square where Ana & Michael needed to get off, but we stop at Herald's Square/34th Street and all go to our respective trains (N train for us). 1 am-we're finally home!  Go straight to bed so that Chris can get up at 5:15 am to be at work at 7 am.  FANTASTIC!

      I've heard of people looking for love on the internet, but this website is a touch worrisome.  Simply titled  urlLink A Family Proposal , I wonder what kind of people are actually interested in something like this.  I'm sure there are plenty who have responded in earnest, but my response to that is: What the f*ck?!?  As many times as I've emailed my fantastic blog to myself so that I could post, it keeps getting lost along the way.  Seems that someone in our IT department at work sucks.  Luckily, I printed it out today and will now post it so I hope that it has the same passion that I had the other day writing it.  If not, blame the IT guy - I am.  So, here goes:  So there's this guy who is so upset with the current presidential administration that he has put a plea out on the Internet to raise enough money to move his wife, child and himself to the Netherlands.  He supplies numbers and percentages of people supporting/against Bush, the economy, job loss, etc., but I don't think all of his facts are straight.  Granted, I voted for Bush in 2000 and I'm not sure how I'll vote in 2004, but I loathe that EVERYTHING gets blamed on Bush and the current administration.  Something tells me that we didn't lose all of those jobs just because Bush is in office.  I agree that the Patriot Act isn't the best solution to today's problems, and yes, we have "lost" certain freedoms that we once took for granted.  I don't think Iraq was as an imminent threat as we were once told, but a threat nonetheless.  And I don't think it would have been long before it would have become an imminent threat.  There has to be some other underlying issue here - perhaps it could have something to do with the former administration, but to be honest, I don't know and I don't care enough to spend all my days combing facts & figures trying to point fingers when finger pointing won't get the job done.  If anything, it feels like the Bush Administration is running this country like a business.  This guy has even gone so far as to imply that Bush will somehow rig the voting machines in the upcoming election since the maker of the machines, Diebold, is a Bush supporter.  So to  urlLink Daryl , I say, "Haul your ass to The Netherlands and I don't give a shit how you get there!  You won't get any donations from me.  I had to work hard and save to get myself and all of my shit to NYC, so you can do the same, buddy."  Oh!  And when people tell this guy to just leave the US, his response is, "I always find this to be a strange contradiction for a nation that prides itself on 'satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.'"  Ok, Daryl, are you talking about America or Wal-Mart here?  Strangely, I've never heard of this catchy little national motto he speaks of unless of course I'm standing in line at a store or I've just ordered something AS SEEN ON TV.  I seem to remember America's jingle being something like: IN GOD WE TRUST.  I don't know - call me crazy.

      Well, I had this fantastic blog for today's post, but like before, it has gotten lost between here and there.  Oh well, it will be there to post tomorrow.  Luckily, I saved it this time.  Go me!!  I think I just pissed Chris off.  I won't go into details cause it's just confusing, but it included him taking a nap and me trying to send him to bed for the tonight.  Needless to say, he's not my biggest fan right now.  I guess I should go in there and help out now that he's worked out his anger on the poor helpless chicken.

      Another Saturday night well spent!  Chris, Cindy (Chris's sister), and her new boyfriend John, & I went to an Italian restaurant and then to the Upright Citizens Brigade last night.  Good time though I must say that the UCB seems to have blown up in popularity since our last visit about a month ago.  Still a good time no matter how many uptight college kids bump into me in line without saying "excuse me."  Before the show started, the 4 of us perused the grocery store next to the theatre where we happened to see a couple of the actors/comedians from the UCB.  One of the guys does spots on VHI for shows like  The 80's Strikes Back  and  The Best Week Ever .  It probably won't be the last time I see these guys since Chris will begin taking improv classes in early March.  He's been wanting to do this for a while, so I'm glad he got off his ass and signed up - oh, that's right, I had to actually sign him up.  Well, close enough.  And now, the list of random links for your viewing pleasure: Your very own  urlLink Pimp Cup  - just what every family dinner needs!  I've seen some interesting things posted by the Japanese and I can proudly add this to this to the ever-growing list.  Check out some of the  urlLink strangest trucks  on the planet!  If you ever thought your house was messy, please click on this link for what must be the  urlLink most cluttered house in America !  I don't understand how someone lives like this.  The sad thing is that I'm sure there are homes that are worse than this.  And now for the  urlLink suicidal snowman  - I must admit that I'm getting stircrazy myself with this cold weather.  And let's not leave out those of you looking for additions to your art collection.   urlLink Gallery of Original Booty Babe Art  - you know you're curious!  Just go ahead and click on the link.  Ah!  I'm so proud: the  urlLink Miss White Trash Beauty Pageant .  Fantastic ladies.  You make us all so proud.  I guess the one positive thing I can point out is that NONE of these ladies are from the Deep South.  Ah!  And some  urlLink virtual knee surgery  for your viewing/interactive pleasure!  You get to actually perform the surgery yourself and, for me, find out why I'm not a surgeon making loads of money.  Even though this is animated, it still makes me slightly queasy.  Until tomorrow, kids, Enjoy!!

      So, I'm doing my research for our trip to Europe this August. Since we don't want to squander all of our money in Europe, I'm looking into staying at some hostels. What are hostels, you ask? Well, they can be anything from a B&B, dorms, convent, etc. where you share rooms and bathrooms. Usually, the men sleep in one area and the women in another though private rooms are available for a slightly higher rate. Hostels are great if you want to keep things cheap and you want to meet loads of different people. For the most part, it appears that younger people stay at hostels - especially all of those who are backpacking across Europe. I'm really intrigued by this whole concept and can't wait to stay in one! We'll, of course, have a few nights in a real hotel with our own private bath - probably in Rome and then in Paris. We're planning to take the eurail from Rome to Paris and stop at various places along the way. You know, keep our travel somewhat open and spontaneous. I think we must be tapping into some part of ourselves that missed out when we were just a bit younger and a bit poorer.   Yesterday after work, some of the girls, Chris and I went out for a few drinks at this place called The Grotto. Today, I'm going with Olivia to a margarita place - if the Chairman of our company doesn't open up a bottle of wine for us after work, that is. I'm hoping he'll open up the wine and we can drink here instead of spending our money elsewhere. I need to blow off some steam after today's fiasco of trying to get an earlier flight for someone that I work with. The whole thing ended with him on a later flight (due to weather delays) and him hanging up on me. At that point, I went downstairs for coffee and a puff off of my friend's cigarette. I don't smoke unless I'm REALLY pissed off, which doesn't happen very often. Very frustrating!  OK, time for a few links. First, the  urlLink RoboReceptionist . I never thought I would feel threatened by the advancement of working robots in my job as an Administrative Assistant. When you see movies like A.I. or Terminator and the like, you think about automotive jobs or factory jobs being the first where robots replace humans in the workforce. Now, with the RoboReceptionist, they're hitting closer to home and I don't think that I like it. There are still downsides to this little experiment of theirs: the person seeking info must type in their question; she can't handle anything too complicated, etc. It's just scary - that's all I'm saying.   So do you remember they guy from the American Idol tryouts - Hawaii, I think it was - that made you laugh until you pee'd your pants when he sang Ricky Martin's She Bangs? Well, this guy has such a cult following from his 90 seconds of fame, he now has his own website and he actually has contracts and deals! I saw him on TV last night on ESPN, I think. He's been on the Ellen Degeneres show and has been the subject of a skit on SNL. Check him out  urlLink here . You'll need speakers/sound to hear his American Idol audition. Warning! William Hung has had NO professional training - just so we're clear on this.

      Sorry for the absence in blogging as of late. No excuses really - just being lazy. Chris offered to do the dishes tonight so that leaves me wonder what it is exactly that he wants out of this. Oops! Now he's singing The Bee Gees' Staying Alive. In a really high pitched voice. And I think he's dancing in there. If only you could witness this event!  I have a FANTASTIC list of links to dole out to you but, unfortunately, I must go assist with dinner tonight: lemon chicken, rice, and broccoli.  Since I hear that my father-in-law (we'll call him Fred) is feeling down today all the way down in Lake Charles, La, I'm adding this link especially for him and because I know we need to see one more parody of the Janet/Justin Super Bowl Showstopper! Click  urlLink here . Ok, the real link I wanted to include for him is  urlLink here . Caution - contains nudity. Oh! And because I know he's probably pretty bored sitting in his hotel room, click here to play a small  urlLink game . Chris says it's addictive and since I had to physically remove him from the computer because of this game, I'll agree. I nearly forgot - just in case anyone has been left wondering, the advanced  urlLink Donald Rumsfield fighting techniques  are here! OK, OK, I have to go help make dinner. The rest of the list will come soon! I promise!  And last but not least (by far!) - Shout out to my 1-year-old nephew (as of yesterday) IAN!! Happy Birthday playa!

      I'll be back later today to blog after I return from Manhattan. I'm to meet Cindy & Jackson at H&M Clothing Store on 5th Avenue, which is across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral. Unfortunately, it's butt-ass cold outside and I'm not looking forward to being outside today but I just can't sit home all day today. I HAVE TO get out of my apartment! OK, just talked to Cindy and we're meeting at Ellen's Stardust Diner on the corner of 51st and Broadway, which is the ONLY diner that I can remember where it's located. It's also the diner we ALWAYS go to when someone comes to visit. The wait staff sings during your meals - they're all aspiring actors/actresses hoping to make their big break in the City.  Chris and I have been looking into different locations for our trip, which we've decided to take around our 2-year anniversary in August. So it seems we're looking around the Mediterranean - maybe start in Rome and then see where the winds take us.  On a progressive note, Chris has FINALLY signed up to take classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater starting March 7th. His class will be on Sunday evenings.  This is only level 1 and he'll have a few more to go through, but he'll give this one a shot and see how he likes it. Personally, I don't understand how he's not already on stage somewhere. If you've ever met him, you know he's hilarious! By the way, the Upright Citizens Brigade is where Horatio Sanz (of SNL) got his start, among others like Matt Walsh. Oh! Chris dogsat for Adam Sandler the other day at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Most of the cast of 50 First Dates were at the hotel for a press junket. Chris says they're all really nice - especially Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider. Points in our books, boys, points in our books.  This week's  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings  I say ... and you think ... ?   1. Dragon :: China 2. Molecule :: scientist 3. Tire :: Goodyear 4. Mighty :: Joe Young 5. Octane :: fuel 6. Troll :: bridge, stream, pay a toll 7. Atmosphere :: pressure 8. Guide :: you lead, I'll follow 9. Leash :: dog 10. Dustmite :: need to dust  OK, off to eat some diner food baby!

      Not much going on today since it's the most dreaded day of the year for every single person on the planet. I'm not single, but Chris and I have both expressed our distaste for this "holiday" over dinner and a movie last night. By the way, 50 First Dates was pretty damn funny! I recommend. Ok, so off to the weird links I found this morning.  This one is just strange, gross and there's really no other explanation for it since I have no idea what's going on - all in Japanese or something. Very strange. Click  urlLink here .  Ever wondered what it would be like to pop a water balloon in space? I know you have. I sometimes can't sleep at night without trying to figure out just what would happen. Well, you can now rest easy because it's finally  urlLink here !  Want a hoodie with the name of your neighborhood on it? Then click  urlLink here .  Cute stuff.  Want to see an animated  urlLink girl pee standing up ? Yep, very strange indeed. Thank you Magic Cone. I will not be buying this one.  OK, this is something you just have to see! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! Click  urlLink here !  And next, a pretty damn funny  urlLink Nutrigrain  commercial. At the end, you'll feel GREAT!  And finally, a  urlLink weird and twisted animated movie . It's what every Valentine's Day needs.  So on this special day, Rock Hard & Love Long!

      Ah! Elevator Episodes! What are Elevator Episodes, you ask? Well, you see, at work I go down for coffee every afternoon around 2:30 pm with some friends. When the mood strikes us and there isn't anyone else in the elevator we work with, we start these louder-than-usual conversations about random things - can't get into details. We like to stay covert in our operations. It's funny when one our lips are quivering because we're having a hard time keeping a straight face or we're counting floors because we're about to pop a stitch. I wonder if we're really having as much fun as we think we're having or if we're just delirious by that point in the day. Ah, who cares.  My Dad sent me the following today and I just had to share: Southernisms  Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit.  It's been hotter'n a goat's butt in a pepper patch.  He fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down.  It's so dry the trees are bribing the dogs.  He's as country as cornflakes.  This is gooder'n grits.  Busier than a cat covering crap on a marble floor.  If things get any better, I may have to hire someone to help me enjoy it.  I'm bout as nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  Busy as a moth in a mitten.  Happy as a clam at high tide.

I can spray Berg with the water bottle using my left hand from across the room in the middle of the night in the dark and hit him square between the eyes 100. Instead of road rage, I get subway rage when people bump into me without saying excuse me

      Howdy do?! I'm working on a list for tomorrow's post which is quite time consuming, so I won't post too much today. Chris just sold both of his paintballs guns on eBay. One will go to Indiana and the other goes off to Kansas. May they make someone happy. They're making me happy just by not being here and when the money comes through for the payment on these things, it'll been even sweeter. OK, off to make some spaghetti for my honey.

      Wow! Another fantastically boring Monday! Well, I guess that's better than being too busy to sit down at my desk. So I will try not to complain. At lunch today, I went over to The Gap to get my little nephew something for his birthday coming up on the 17th. So I'm at the cash register and the guy says, "did you buy out the store?" and I artfully reply, "well, if the women's section wasn't done entirely in pastels, I would have bought something for myself instead." Yes, I know I left him reeling in shock but sometimes you just have to put your foot down. I absolutely refuse to wear pastel colors so that I match a gazillion random kids walking down the sidewalks of New York. Not me, buddy. No way.  Speaking of fantastic days, I got the new Mardi Gras rice bag order form in today's mail from Bertrand Rice down in Elton, Louisiana! http://www.bertrandrice.com Check out their site and order something! The couple that owns/runs this little shindig are cousins of mine on my Dad's side. Every time we would go down to South Louisiana to visit, we would stay at their house. David & Lorraine have 3 kids: Jon, Andre & Julie. So much fun!! Jon is in school and is also currently in a band that travels around playing Cajun music. Andre is at McNeese studying hard, I'm sure. Julie is at LSU and running track. My oldest sister, Bridget, sees her from time to time, as Bridget is a grad student at LSU.   Well, I haven't been down to good ole Elton in about 7 years and I sure would like to go again soon. They do an old fashioned Mardi Gras run where all the men dress up and ride horseback along a predetermined route. They start (usually) at my cousin Todd's house for a little breakfast. The men ride their horses while a wagon follows that carries the musicians and the beer. At homes along the route, the Captain of the "krewe" will ask for permission for the group to approach the house. Once they have permission, the group sings a song, which asks for a little something to go into the pot for their gumbo. If the owner wishes to contribute a chicken, for example, then they release the live chicken in the yard for the boys to catch. Once the chicken is caught, its neck is wrung and it is tied to one of their horses to be brought back to add to the gumbo. This continues throughout the route and they acquire various ingredients for the gumbo. The ride ends at the local Catholic Church where the women take the goodies the men have brought back and they make their gumbo. All who have contributed are invited to attend and partake in some social gathering and mighty fine gumbo.  OK, off the feel good stuff for a bit. Time to get down to stupid political antics: Amazingly enough, someone (OK, any active Democrat about right now) out there is willing to spend hard earned money to look into whether or not our President went AWOL from the Alabama National Guard in 1972. Granted there's no investigation at this point, but as this is an issue now, it will certainly be an issue later this year during the campaign for the White House. I'm floored - who the hell cares?!? Do you? If you were going to vote for George Bush in November, would this newfound knowledge change your vote? Are we voting on what happened in 1972 (6 years before I was born) or are we voting on what's going on right now in this country and in this wonderful world of ours? Yeah to Kerry who received 3 purple hearts, a bronze star and a silver star in Vietnam. Congratulations. Well done. Kudos. That still doesn't tell me that he can run this ship any better than ole George W. F*ck it! I'm voting for Ross Perot.  And finally, the Grammys. I guess if you didn't know who Beyonce was before, then you do now. Other than that, the show left me hopeful that MTV's music awards will be absolutely fabulous this year because the Grammy's were slightly boring. The media has used the words: demure, downplayed, etc. They say the only way Justin Timberlake was allowed appear was if he apologized, which he did. BORING! I wish Janet had shown up - that really would have rattled everyone! And we'd all be happier viewers if SOMEONE - ANYONE would have gotten rattled. Thank goodness MTV goes over the top each year!  Top 10 Reasons to visit yayaempress: 10. Rotel Tomatoes (Queso) 9. Mrs. Gertie this, Mrs. Gertie that 8. Comfortable Couch 7. Chris's Teeth 6. umm, chicken! merrily! 5. SERGIO 4. Ummm Sandwiches 3. Coooo-kies 2. "so this is Queens" 1. Watch the relationship between Berg and Yayaempress unfold  Top 10 Reason NOT to visit yayaempress: 10. Do I take the N or the W train? 9. "attention... attention this is a Brooklyn bound train" 8. "I hope Berg does not bite me" 7. Unlimited supply of Comedy Central (Chris!) 6. 1 hour and 15 min. commute 5. memory loss 4. "no more wire hangers" 3. Mrs. Gertie 2. sex, lies and video tapes 1. "sure is a lot of noise coming from upstairs"

      Not much going on this weekend. A couple of friends came over yesterday afternoon. We just sat around and ate, drank beer watched a movie and some funny shows on TV. Good time! Plan was to go out last night, but I wasn't really feeling that well so we altered our plans. Thanks girls! Next time, we're definitely going out!  I found a really cool website the other night that was stamped onto a $1 bill, which was also stamped with a fleur-de-lis. Check out  urlLink Where's George  where you can track your paper currency and see where different bills have traveled over time. You can enter in bills that are currently in your wallet after you open an account (free!), so check it out!  This next one will make you chuckle and yet I found it to be slightly disturbing. But don't take my word for it, check out Mr. Bush in  urlLink drag .  I say ... and you think ... ?  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings   1. Identity:: different 2. Reveal:: open 3. Live:: not dead yet 4. Attitude:: extra flavor 5. Night:: sleep 6. Nevada:: Las Vegas 7. Weekend:: no work/sleep late 8. Write:: something I like to do 9. Friend:: it takes all different kinds 10. Seventeen:: ah! the year I graduated high school  Well, those crazy Asians have done it again! Check out the Asian version of  urlLink Cereal and Milk . I just shook my head the whole time.

      Damn Verizon. For some reason, I haven't been able to access my home email. Hope they get that fixed soon. I must have a billion junk emails to sort through so I can feel important. Why, yes, I would like to enlarge my penis, look at busty girls all the live long day, and make millions without ever leaving my home. America in the 21st century - isn't it great!  Here's a little diddy I think you'll like. It takes a moment to load and it's in a different language, but sometimes you just don't need to understand what's being said to understand what's going on. Click  urlLink %20&f_id=681">here .  Well, it looks like I've found yet another website for  urlLink 80's paraphenelia . AWESOME!  Here it is!! The website of the guy who  urlLink streaked the Super Bowl ! Yeah, baby!!  And this next one is kind of creepy, but it's like a wreck on the side of the road. You HAVE TO watch it! You can't stop. It's addicting. Check it out  urlLink here . It's almost as creepy as watching that doll thing sit in front of her computer and take off her clothes or rearrange herself or whatever she was doing. Remember that one? If not, check that one out  urlLink here .  And for all of my fellow drinking friends, you'll enjoy this little site devoted to  urlLink drinking stuff . You can find out your blood alcohol content, drink converter, drink calorie counter, etc. Not a bad spot to visit.

      I've added another link under "blogs i read" in case you're interested. It's  urlLink Yates on the States  and pretty damn cool by my standards. Seems I spend most of my days floating from blog to blog to blog. Always lookin' baby, always lookin'. As a matter of fact, I just rolled over to ole' Faye's site and she seems to be having a rather rotten day. To quote, if I may:  "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuckity, fuck fuck!!!! And that's how I feel no matter what.   fuck it."  It would seem our dear friend could use a little pick-me-up. Poor dear. I'll have to send her some stickers or some other cool crap that fell out of yet another magazine onto my living room floor. Have no fear - I'll send something cool Faye! I promise!  So, I bit the bullet and called Salvation Army today. It seems that I neglected to post about this lovely experience, but about 3 weeks ago I scheduled an appointment so they would come by and pick up all of the junk Chris & I have set aside for donation. January 31st - last Saturday. So I jump out of bed around 8:30 Saturday morning. Throw clothes on. Forego a shower just in case they should come by for the pick up. (you can see where this is going, right?) Chris is asleep and I don't want to wake him, so I pull out all of the donation items (9 boxes and 3 or 4 bags) into the front hallway. This is great since the guys won't have to walk too far and can grab the stuff and go. Fantastic! I'm on top of things. Well, the hours tick away. Chris finally wakes up. Says, "they still haven't come to get this stuff?" Smartass. Next thing I know, it's 9:30 at night and I'm telling Chris, "well, they could technically still come, right?" I am so stupid, stupid, stupid. I was all set to buy some rather large garbage bags this weekend and throw all of it out, but Chris made me feel guilty. So, I called them again today and in about 2+ more weeks, it'll all finally be GONE!! Again.  Now I'm going to turn toward the TV in my nice swivel computer chair and watch a repeat of The Apprentice since I missed last week's episode. And then at 8:30 pm, I switch over to American Idol. There! I said it - I WATCH AMERICAN IDOL! But in my defense, this is the 1st season I've watched it and there really hasn't been much on TV since I started watching only 2 or 3 days ago. Uh! I need to go take a shower.

      Not much happening in my world right now. I was supposed to go out to dinner with Chris at this place called  urlLink Water's Edge , which is here in Astoria but it has a fantastic view of Manhattan. So I'd heard loads about it, right? Right. So last week, I call up and get reservations for tonight at 7 pm (it being Restaurant Week and everything). All set - everything's a go. Then, we were to go to  urlLink Copacabana  for a party for one of Chris's co-workers. Well, without getting into too much detail (because frankly, I'm a bit tired today), dinner is cancelled and Chris is now partying at  urlLink Copacabana  with his buddies. It was all a time issue really since Chris's friends started partying at around 4 pm. Since I had to work until 5 pm and then go home, change clothes and try to find the place by myself . . uh, . . . don't think so kid. From what I read online, the place has quite the line on Tuesday nights not to mention velvet ropes. Sorry, but I find velvet ropes to be intimidating.  Well, for anyone else who has had a long day, perhaps you'll enjoy this little diddy:  urlLink Online Orgasmic Simulation . Interestingly enough, there is no nudity associated with this link but not something you want to try to expain to little Johnny sneaking a peek over your shoulder. Enjoy my little ones. Enjoy.  Well, since not much else is going on, I'll end this by sending out a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY to  urlLink Natalie ! I'm just a fan of her site. Pretty damn kickass, my friends. Kickass.  urlLink Natalie , I hope you party like a rockstar for at least 1 night!

      Super Bowl - one game, so many topics around the water cooler this morning. #1 - can we address the fact that  exposing Janet Jackson's ta-ta WAS planned? Regardless of who said what after the "incident," it was planned. CBS might not have known about it, not sure if MTV knew about it, but Justin Timberlake & Janet Jackson certainly did - hence the huge chunk of metal attached to her nipple. And why don't we back up just one more step: why the hell was Janet Jackson even performing? She hasn't had a hit in like 10 years! All of the other performers have had hits in the last 1-2 years. Why Janet? Why not some Grammy award-winning performer from the last 2 or 3 years? If you ask me (and it  really doesn't matter if you didn't since I get to rant on and on and on, but), this was all a big stunt to 1) boost a sagging career & tat-ta and 2) take the media off her brother for a bit. Don't know how well that worked out since the FCC is now looking for some answers. Good luck with that one CBS, MTV, Janet & Justin! But don't take my word for it! No, listen to what a real expert has to say! Click  urlLink here .  Oh! And #2 of my rant from above: why didn't they show us the streaker?!? (top of the 3rd quarter) I'm outraged! It's not like he wasn't at least wearing a thong. I'm shocked and appalled that I wasn't offered the chance to watch some British guy running naked across the field during out beloved Super Bowl. It's the Super Bowl, man! Why wouldn't  someone streak? And if it's never happened before, then the real question is why has it never happened before. I mean, this is America gosh-dog-gonnit! Why did we have to let someone else do our dirty work for us?!? We're not thinking Americans!   And now it's time for  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings ! I say . . . and you think . . .?  1. Ignore :: the stupid bitch to your right 2. Death :: party for the deceased 3. Missy :: Elliott 4. Ballet :: tutus 5. Guest :: not actually invited to the party, but they lucked up anyway 6. Campus :: college 7. Lonely :: in a crowd 8. Company :: sometimes a lot of work 9. Helicopter :: twirly bird 10. Sterile:: easy form of birth control  Ever wondered what Lord of the Rings would have been like if it'd been written by someone other than JRR Tolkein? You know you have! Click  urlLink here . The VC Andrews one is pretty darn good!  A little sampling if you will: Dr. Seuss  by  urlLink gonzoron   "Gandalf, Gandalf! Take the ring! I am too small to carry this thing!"  "I can not, will not hold the One. You have a slim chance, but I have none. I will not take it on a boat, I will not take it across a moat. I cannot take it under Moria, that's one thing I can't do for ya. I would not bring it into Mordor, I would not make it to the border."

      I'm sure most everyone is watching the Super Bowl today. Hell, I even know a few people who actually went all the way to Houston to watch it all in person. Ah, the perks of knowing people in the business. They don't get the tickets for free, but they at least get a chance to buy decent tickets. I hope they're having a blast! For the rest of us sitting at home watching all of the pre-game mumbo gumbo, here's a little something to help while away the time:  This next couple may take a little bit to load, but hysterically disturbing, nonetheless. Not something to watch with impressionable kids around. Part 1:  urlLink Stick Figure Penalty  Part 2:  urlLink Stick Figure Penalty: Chamber 2   This next one is long, but worth it. It's interactive and has loads of violence. Enjoy!  urlLink Ray - Part 1   And the  urlLink Bug on a Wire  game is always fun!  Ok, little ones, I'm off to watch more Super Bowl mumbo gumbo and pray that my darling husband will do the laundry like he said he would do. Just earlier he called me and offered me $50 to do it for him, but I did it the last few times all by myself and I think it's just his turn already. Besides, I know he'd probably never actually hand over that money so I'm just saving myself extra work. And he had 3 days off this weekend. He's Mr. Procrastinator! And I am his lovely bride. Tee Hee!

      Learning how to sew . . . it takes a lot of patience.  Amanda came over Monday night and we laid out some fabric for a crib bumper she's making for her sister.  Unfortunately, we had to lock Berg out of the room so he wouldn't lay down on the fabric and pattern pieces.  The whole time he was shut out, he kept sticking his little furry orange paw underneath the door.  He can be cute and funny sometimes and then he can be the devil other times.  He's a very strange animal indeed.  Chris and I went to the UCB last night for a couple of shows.  All very awesome and very hilarious!

      Last Friday, I honed by flower arranging skills once again.  The president of our company has a vineyard in Australia and at harvest time each season, he has flowers from the vineyard shipped to our offices.  My friend (and coworker), Laurren, and I do most of the arranging.  Another friend, Dawn, sometimes helps out - but she's usually busier than we are.  Anyway, we ended up making like 7 or 8 arrangements from these 2 boxes and these are some of the most exotic flowers I've ever seen.  They have this one flower called a protea, which actually comes from bush, and it looks like that plant/flower from  Little Shop of Horrors  that at any point could jump out and eat you.     Otherwise, not too much has been happening.  I was in one crazy ass mood this past weekend.  You know the kind when you've started evaluating certain areas of your life and you don't like what you see but you can't blame anyone but yourself?  Yeah, I was in that mood Saturday and Sunday.  Chris & I were supposed to be going to Peter Luger's Steakhouse again tonight with some of his friends from The Essex House (hotel), but those plans changed.  Now, I think we're going to slip out to a couple of shows at Upright Citizens Brigade.  Should be loads of fun since we haven't been in a little over a week.  Ok, off to powder the nose and then off to the show.  Later gators.  Oh!  And I knew I said I would do the links today - and I might still after we get back - but if I don't, tough shit.  You'll get them when you're ready for them.  Now behave!

      OK, so now I've decided to change things again.  Since some people were getting confused as to whether or not these stories are autobiographical, I've decided to move them to a different page with a link to the right - titled  urlLink YAYA STORIES .  Let me assure you that these stories are all fiction.  My husband is a loving man who puts me on the top of a pedestal - for the most part.  I slip off the pedestal when things like paintball and comic books come up, but that's only happens once in a full moon so I'm ok with that.  If you enjoy the stories, them drop me a line and let me know.  I don't know how often I will post a new chapter in this ongoing saga, but I will do my best to entertain the masses.  I will have to get to the weekly links tomorrow since I now need to go make dinner: pork chops, mashed potatoes, gravy & green beans.  Yep, I cook!  Go figure!

      Since I've changed my posts as of late, I guess I should explain.  I used to write some short little stories for my own personal amusement back in high school.  Now since I have so much free time on my hands and this blog as an outlet, I've decided to pick it back up again.  But have no fear, you will still get your weekly links.  Unfortunately, this weekend's links will come after I get back from a baby shower out on Long Island and while I am doing laundry once I get back from the shower.  So until then, enjoy the stories and if you just hate them, post a comment and we'll go from there.

      She had such a fucked weekend.  It all started Friday with too much to drink.  On Saturday, he just wouldn't quit calling her names.  He said he was just picking on her, but she'd had enough.  The whole situation pissed her off.  To top it all off, he began lecturing her on getting a new job.  She doesn't know why he thinks she hates her job so much.  She's told him time and time again that she likes her job.  She likes the people she works with.  Why does he keep telling her that she needs to find another job - one that she'll actually enjoy going to.  How many times does she have to tell him?  And now she's left by herself the whole day to contemplate the past few days.  She wakes up feeling inadequate.  She feels like a loser.  She doesn't like how she feels about herself or her situation.  And that seems to be the problem with her.  People push and push her in directions that aren't her own.  She's played everyone else's games for the past few years.  Now she feels stifled and ignored and yet she knows that her situation won't change unless she takes hold of the reins.  That one little step is the scariest and she knows it, but she's tired of feeling this way.  She can see a fight coming soon.  A big one.  One that will affect her in many ways.  And yet she knows that it will only affect those areas in her life that she allows it to affect.  She has to be in control again.   *all stories are fiction

      "I got a new pink top this morning to wear to Webster Hall for fight night tomorrow," she told her friend.  "Pink?" her friend inquires.  Yes, she thought, my world's gone to pink!  But I can't get away from it this season.  It stares out at me from every single store window I pass.  It seems that every shop in Manhattan has clothes in varying shades of pepto bismol.  What to do, she pondered.  She'll wear her new pink top that's topless but has this swanky piece of lace that is attached under the breast and then wraps around her neck, knowing that it will choke her at some point during the night.  Knowing that part of her future is taken care of, she turns her thoughts to dinner.  Nothing jumps out at her from the cabinets, which is a good thing considering food doesn't generally jump.  She knows the pork chops in the freezer will take too long to thaw.  And if she went that route, she'll have eaten Berg's cat food before dinner would be ready.  "It should definitely be something that tastes good," he suggests.  She nods her approval and hopes that he wouldn't prefer something that tastes like it came off the subway floor instead.  She shakes her head and narrows it down to meatless spaghetti or ordering dinner from the Chinese place down the street.  "Spaghetti!" he says, so spaghetti it is.  ***  She stands at the sink washing last night's dishes and she thinks back to her commute home this evening.  They guy she sat next to on the train smelled curiously like hotdogs.  She tried not to look directly at him as it is common knowledge that you just don't look directly at anyone in New York City.  He got off at Queensboro Plaza and took the smell of hotdogs with him.  Perhaps he's a street vendor, she thought.   *all stories are fiction

      "Sweet, sweet nectar of Mexico!  La Cerveza Mas Fina!  I concur!" she shouts.  He just looks at her from the couch, controller in hand.  She's drinking her Corona and he has Star Wars on the brain.  She's had a long day and doesn't want to think about how she stayed 45 minutes late at work today.  "I wanna be on Hollywood Squares!" he says.  OK.  Pencil that one in.  Today is just another day for the record books.  Another day spent staying late at work, which seems to be happening a lot more lately.  Ever since that fateful memo was circulated, her workload seems to have doubled.  She thinks back to the days when she first started working at this company.  She had nothing to do.  Absolutely nothing besides flipping through magazines, surfing the internet and planning her wedding.    Two and half years later, she wonders why her boots hate her so much and what will happen if she can no longer walk like a normal person.  "You're becoming a New Yorker," they tell her.  Fashion - it hurts so much sometimes.  She remembers when she was a little girl, when her mom would fix her hair and she would squirm in the chair.  Her mom would say, "you have to suffer to be beautiful."  She grins and looks back down at her feet knowing that by morning, she'll have forgotten how she had to peel her boots off along with the wet, sweaty socks.  In the morning, she'll pull her boots back on for one more day, waiting for Spring and Summer - flip flop season!   *all stories are fiction

      This just in:    urlLink Ozzy Voted Alien Ambassador     Where there's water, there must be life, therefore Mars must have aliens. Internet pollsters recently voted Ozzy Osbourne as the favorite to represent Earth to our alien brethren. Other top choices included Tony Blair, George Bush, and Simon Cowell. What a bizarre perspective aliens would get of humanity!    Followed by:   urlLink  Two top French nutritionists are telling people to go for a Big Mac and keep their fingers off the traditional French quiche .

       Your Sunday Links:    urlLink PETA , eat your heart out.  I'd be surprised to find I don't have a relative in a similar picture somewhere in the universe.  Fantastic site.  Just  urlLink click it .  You'll love it.  You'll bookmark it.  You'll thank me.  I've heard this one before, but it's always so funny to hear again.  It's a  urlLink radio prank call gone wrong .  When I was younger, we would go out to visit my grandparents every Sunday after church.  Louisiana being Louisiana and summer being damn hot, we always found ourselves sitting out on the front porch and my grandfather would always have a fly swatter by his side killing all of the unlucky flies who came within range.  Now that I'm here in NYC, I don't have a front porch and summer is rarely hot.  I very rarely see flies here, but I can relive my memories with the  urlLink virtual fly swatter .  Hours of useless fun!  I found  urlLink this website  on blorgy and laughed my ass off!  Of course I cringed toward the end and I am now rethinking the whole childbearing thing.  I have never heard childbirth described in such a fashion.  Funny, but scary.  And finally, some awesome  urlLink doctored photos .  Really cool!

      She steps out into the cold wet night and clings to his arm as they turn and head toward the busier street just down the corner.  She smiles as they catch sight of a yellow cab sitting on the opposite side of the street.  They're lucky; it's so hard to find a yellow cab when it's raining.  He motions to the cabbie and they climb in the backseat and are on their way.  They sit in silence as they cross the bridge into Manhattan.  She likes looking into the apartments that are lit up, noticing how they're decorated and arranged in comparison to the others.  He has his sights set toward downtown but says nothing.  They're both lost in their thoughts and the goodies displayed in shop windows they pass.  At the corner of 8th Avenue and 26th Street, they pay the cabbie the $15 fare and climb out to make their way to the little theater that has become one of their favorite spots.  Inside they wait in line for the box office to open.  They're always so anxious to get good seats; they like to be in the first row.  The box office announces the sale of tickets and they step up to pay their $16.  Once in the theater, they grab their usual seats, drop off their coats and head to the bathroom and then the bar for $4 beers.  The details are taken care so now they can enjoy the next hour which promises to be filled with laughter and fun.  After the show, they step out of the little theater smiling and recount their favorite parts of the show.  Then talk turns to food and their cross-town trip they need to make to get to their next stop of the evening.  He hails a cab and they hop in.  "We need to get to 33rd Street at 2nd Avenue, please," she says.  She turns to him and asks how he's feeling and if he's up for the rest of the night.  He assures her that he's fine and that he'll let her know if he starts feeling bad again.  At the corner of 31st and 2nd Avenue, they climb out of the cab and begin the search for dinner.  They pick a nice little restaurant and bar just 2 doors down from their next stop for the evening.  It's dark inside with old fashioned lighting and a nice dark oak bar that just begs patrons to pull up a stool and order an ale.  They comply and also order a little food to help ward off the evils of drinking on empty stomachs.  They make small talk with the bartender and listen to one of the regulars telling stories in a booming voice.  They laugh with the others and then turn their attention toward their food and drink when it arrives.  An hour later, they pay their $25 bill and leave the bartender a $10 tip, step out into the night and walk the 5 steps to the last stop for the night.  Once inside the crowded bar, they make their way to the back to find her friends drinking beers and cocktails; introductions are made.  He steps up to the bar and orders them beers.  Heineken for her, Corona with a lime for him.  They walk out the back door down the steps to the covered courtyard bearing a pool table.  A couple of guys are setting up for a game of 8-ball.  It's chilly out, but the alcohol helps to keep them warm.    They hang out with their friends for the next couple of hours and then decide to head home around midnight.  He has to be at work early the next morning.  Outside the bar, they walk uptown a couple of blocks to get ahead of the others hailing cabs on the street.  They spot a cab making a dropoff and then climb inside.  Twenty minutes later, they're home.  They struggle out of their coats and winter clothes.  She slips into something a little more comfortable; a purple silk slip with lace.  Ten minutes later, the lights go out and they head to the bedroom.  Yes, it's another great night that leaves them smiling as they fall asleep in each other's arms.   *all stories are fiction.

      Happy Belated Birthday Roni!!  Sorry, I missed my post yesterday since we were watching  Dawn of the Dead  , which was awesome!!  Tonight we're going to out a bar on the East side around 34th Street for a friend's birthday party.  $30 all you can drink from 10 pm to 2 am.  Sounds like a winner to me!!  I'll let you know how it turns out.  This link is fun, if not a little gross but I know you'll enjoy it!   urlLink Click here !  For all of the hunters in our lives who have come back from a day in the woods with only 1 sock or part of a tshirt, there's the  urlLink off road commode .  Go to the website and then view the video.  Kinda funny.  This link contains nudity, but it's fascinating.  It's a  urlLink boob job without surgery .  Interesting, indeed.

      Happy, happy Thursday!  When all the good shows come on!  Or most of them anyway.  I read an article that Omorosa, the bitch who got fired from Apprentice, just got some Ebony award and she's got offers for some sort of political commentating job for the upcoming election.  I hope she enjoys her 15 minutes of fame because I can't imagine that she'll last long as dramatic as she is.  I so can't stand that bitch.  Anyway, I was walking into my building today after work and after stopping off to do a little grocery shopping when I ran into one of my neighbors, Julie.  We're inside the building but outside our apartments chatting away and I hear Berg (satanic cat) meowing at the door.  Since I'm just standing there anyway, I let him out into the hallway.  He's rubbing all over the wall kind of hopping as he turns around and goes for another rub.  He's wagging his tail and he's so happy.  As soon as I get us both back inside, he turns evil again.  Ah, what can you expect?  I'm just keeping the water bottle  beside me so I can spray him in the face when he starts scratching on the door or the movies/dvds or the mattress or the window or Chris's amp or the couch . . .

      It is still snowing today - very lightly, but still snowing.  I'm so ready for summer!!  I ended up coming home early today because I'm not feeling well.  Lucky for you, that means that I've found time to post some links since yall have been so good to me lately!  If you haven't seen the QVC knives blooper,  urlLink click here .  It takes a while to load, but damn funny.  And while I was nosing around the net, I came across a story titled:  urlLink RIAA Claims Music on Car Radios Meant Only for Original Vehicle Owner .  The story was pretty comical, which makes me wonder if this website is entirely satirical.  Well, you can be the judge and then feel free to let me know.  Then there is the story of a  urlLink fag and his fagmaster .  Don't worry, this isn't some biased story of homosexuals, but a story of what the true word "fag" is all about.  Interesting little read about a gentler time.  I eventually found this website full of strange, yet very interesting photos.  If you look at nothing else on this page,  urlLink check this out !  I encourage you to also click on the link for  urlLink A Girl's Bestfriend , which again is strange but fascinating.

      OK, where did all of this freaking snow come from?  I mean, I knew it was supposed to snow a bit, but it is  still  snowing and there's like 3+ inches on the ground.  Poured down buckets all day long.  Anyway, Chris & I went to a couple of shows at the UCB tonight and Chris ran into a classmate & her husband of his there.  And then we met another guy who is taking a level 1 class there under the same teacher that Chris has, but on a different night.  Well, while that doesn't matter to you, they were great shows and (again) if you're ever in NYC, please, PLEASE go see a show at UCB.  So worth the $8.  On 26th Street at 8th Avenue.  You need to make reservations and get there 30 minutes before the show starts.  Alright, since it's getting late, I need to get to bed before I turn into a pumpkin.  Cause I do that you know.

      Nothing much going on today, except it was my friend's birthday today.  She said that she work up all depressed and sad.  I know the feeling since I sometimes fall into the sinkhole myself.  But I think her day turned out to very nice indeed.  As I'm sitting on the N train on my way home today after work, I just watch the other people.  And there are certainly different types.  For instance, there are those who read, listen to music, nap until their stop and instantly pop up when they get to their stop.  But first, we'll explore what I've to come to know as Pole-Huggers.  Pole-Huggers stand right against the pole and lean on it no matter who else is holding the pole.  You sometimes even have to pry your fingers from underneath their squishy bodies.  It grosses me out.  Then there are those who bring things to work on on the train, i.e. cross stitch, crotchet, knit, sew, homework, read papers for work, write in their journals, etc.  Just the other day, this guy from Peru approached me on the platform trying to get directions - only he doesn't speak any English.  Unfortunately, my Spanish stinks to high heaven and even though I somehow conveyed this lack of skill to this guy, he insisted on carrying on a conversation with me.  Ok, so what the hell am I to do at this point.  I figure, "yeah, why not work on my Spanish a little?"  A few words back & forth, not really understanding what's going on, I hop off the train.  This is what happens when you spend 2 years of Spanish not learning Spanish.  Ok, I've exhausted what part of my brain was left over from work today.  I must now go heat up some gumbo that I made yesterday and then plop myself down on the couch to watch some Fear Factor.  Tootles kids.

      Funny thing happened to us on the way to the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) last night.  We're in a cab in Astoria heading for the bridge to Manhattan when my window was struck by an orange.  Yes, an orange.  I'm just thankful that the window didn't shatter.  Fucked up.  Anyway, we went to 2 shows last night at UCB and had a great time.  We had to sit on the floor for the 2nd show and that was fine until about the last 20 minutes.  Pain, pain, pain.  I felt bad for stretching my legs out every now and then, but I really couldn't help it.  All in all, an ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC show!!  So then here I am at home by myself today and I do a few things around the house, i.e. vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, washing dishes and the like.  Then I decide to make some gumbo, so I head down to the grocery store to get supplies.  I buy my groceries and head home, start cutting up onions, bell pepper & celery when it dawns on me that I've forgotten to get sausage.  OK, so back down to the grocery store and find out that they don't have the right kind of sausage.  So I debate on whether to go to another store and then decide to go & it takes me only about 2 minutes to find what I need but 10 minutes to get through the check-out line.  I book it back to the apartment and finish up making the gumbo.  Needless to say, it turned into a bigger ordeal than I thought it would have been.  Well, not too many new links for you today, but there is this:  Want to practice your typing skills in a fun game?   urlLink Click here  - it even has a groovy beat to go with it.

      My sister sent me this file and I wanted to share it with all, but unfortunately, I can't post it.  Just as well I guess since it had some big, big nudity in it.  I then found a link to it on another website, but they've pulled the file.  Go figure.  Nothing too exciting happening this weekend.  Chris & I went out to eat last night at this place called The Brick Oven here in Astoria.  Very nice & quaint.  It was only a 15 minute walk there and back, which hopefully helped burn off some of that dessert!  Now on Comedy Central's Dave Chappelle's show, they did a skit about Rick James.  For all of you fans out there - CHRIS - here's a little something for you.  You can get your own   urlLink I'm Rick James, Bitch!   shirt for a mere $14!  Come on, you know you want one!  And if you have money running out of your ass and your out of fresh ideas for Holloween this year,  urlLink click here  and try Riders.  I can't imagine hopping on the subway wearing this.  This past Halloween we squeezed in next to Jesus complete with cross.  It was a tight squeeze, but we managed it.  I think he grazed my ass at one point, but it was Jesus so what was I to do?  Ok, that's all I have for now.  Until later . . .

      Interesting enough, presidential hopeful John Kerry has made mysterious claims that various foreign leaders are pulling for him to beat GW in November. However, he won't release any names since it might damage their relationship with the current administration. There's an  urlLink article in the Washington Times  about this and how they've checked into his travels over the last year or so and cannot substantiate any meeting that he's had with any foreign leaders. Not only that, they say that no foreign leaders have even been in the same area as Mr. Kerry with one exception though Kerry was not at that meeting. The article goes on to say how 75% of those polled thought that terrorists would be happier with a Kerry win in November.  I'm not trying to make this a political blog by any means, but this whole election year so far just irritates me. If America's image wasn't tarnished enough, the bogus claims by Kerry make us the laughing stock of the world. In the  urlLink Washington Times article , there is this quote by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer: "I think it's probably better to keep foreign leaders and the views of foreign leaders out of domestic elections, I mean, certainly we do that here in this country. I mean, people express different views to you, if you're a candidate, I tend not to pass on those kinds of views publicly."

      OK, well blogger or the internet just ate my post.  Too bad, cause you missed some pretty boring shit.  So now I peruse my usual pages and I happened upon a story of a  urlLink 52-year-old man from Kenya  had not bathed in 10 years.  His odor was so bad, the townspeople hatched a plan to trap him, tie him up and then bathe him.  Well, like the saying goes, it takes a village . . .  For all of you out there fed up with your computer, work, or whatever, here's a little game to help you rid your aggression.  You basically just  urlLink beat the crap out of your virtual computer .  Takes a little while to load, but works just the same.  And this website, you just can't beat -  urlLink third nipple piercings .  Yep, third nipple piercing.  No, I didn't stutter and I know you're dying to look.  Don't worry, no one will tell on you if you just look.  You know you want to.  Go ahead - it'll make your booty wink. (courtesy Jerry Brown)  Ok, now someone please tell me I'm right because I have a hard time believing this is real.   urlLink Click here  and tell me what you think.  The picture has to be doctored.  Right?

      I forgot to tell you about my embarrassing mishap at work today.  Olivia went downstairs to smoke and her boss comes looking for her to bring 2 coffees to a meeting.  I offer to get the coffee, grab the company coffee mugs & head down the hall for some fresh coffee.  After arranging it all on a small tray, I proceed to one of the conference rooms, see a meeting but can't see who's holding the meeting due to the way he was sitting.  I walk in, realize it's not the meeting I'm looking for but proceed to offer coffee to the 2 guests as our guy is looking at me quizzically and says "no, but that's nice of you to offer."  I then excuse myself and then head off to find the right conference room.  Face turning red.  Laughing to myself.  Looking pretty stupid when you consider that all of the interior walls of the office are glass from the waist up.  Ok, so it's not as funny now that I'm typing it all out, but trust me, it was funny at the time.  Trust me.

      Just in time for Martha, here are the  urlLink 5 cushiest prisons .  And the dumbest Wal-Mart shopper of all time - A woman was caught trying to pass off a fake $1 million bill at Wal-Mart by purchasing over $1,600 worth of merchandise. Now, I know we've all been to Wal-Mart and they scrutinize $100 bills that come through the registers. I find it hard to believe this woman actually thought she could get away with a $1 million dollar bill. After they arrested her, they found 2 more in her purse. And the kicker is that the US Treasury doesn't even produce $1 million bills, though they are available to purchase as souvenirs at some stores.  Ah, yes,  urlLink Men in Kilts .  It's all I've ever wanted in life.  Interesting little website I found here called  urlLink Rebel Holler .  I haven't explore it completely, so feel free to give a shot and let me know in the comments section if it sucks.  It's certainly a little different.  And is it wrong that I want a  urlLink Sperm Toilet Seat ?  And it's like $12.  Who can beat that?  This next site makes me cringe a little.  It's a guy getting shocked by  urlLink 16,600 volts of electricity .  Remind me never to do PCP.  Or you can take a little pop quiz: can you tell which one is a  urlLink female or shemale ?  I got 12 out of 16.  I demand a recount!

      We're having the strangest weather this week. It was all nice and sunny last week - temperatures into the 60's. This week, IT'S SNOWING. And not just some teeny-tiny little snow flurries here and there. Big fat snowflakes! And now it's stopped. Good, since I forgot my umbrella today.  On the work front, I've finally gotten most of the tax forms faxed off to the 50-something people who requested them. Unfortunately, my boss dumped a whole load of stuff on the production department (which are requests for presentation materials - like 20 copies of each in color). Most of the people in that department are cussing him about now. One girl is so busy (& upset) she won't even look at me since I'm his messenger. And I think he's just informed me in a roundabout way that I may be staying late to help him get something done since he'll be out the rest of the week. On top of that, I still have to go over to my friend's apt in Sunnyside (Queens) to feed her cat. She had to fly home to take care of her mom who broke her hip while her dad goes to the funeral of his wife's brother. Follow me? Tends to get a little confusing at times. I guess this means that Chris will have to start the dinner we were supposed to make last night. Lucky Chris. Oh! And on top of that big pile of crap, I'm exhausted again today. I can feel that pain between my shoulders again.  Pretty cool  urlLink blog by a fellow NY'er .

      Change of plans on dinner - we're ordering in instead.  General Tso's Chicken with a side of crab rangoons.  Wish you were eating at my house, don't ya?  And I forgot to say this because I meant to call last night when Chris got home, but fell asleep:  HAPPY (BELATED) BIRTHDAY MR. MIKE!!

      Another grueling day at the office.  It started off by some investor screaming at me on the phone.  I was proud of myself as I held my tongue instead of telling him to "F*ck off!"  Then, as I'm trying to hole punch the 3000+ pages of tax forms, I jammed the electric hole punch and ended up having to cut my papers out of it.  Then it was off to email a request for duplicates for these destroyed forms.  Great day, great day!  On the plus side:  TODAY IS DAWN'S BIRTHDAY!!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CORN NUT!  Tee hee!!  Anyway, there weren't too many exciting things today.  I'm so completely exhausted I could lie down and cry.  And now I have to go do the dishes and then help Chris make dinner.  We're trying out some pork stirfry tonight.  Don't know how it will work out.  OK, to dishes & dinner . . .

      Well, not much news on this Saturday.  Chris, Sergio & I went to Best Buy, Game Stop & Sports Authority today in Sunnyside.  I picked up some workout clothes & a new sports bra along with a jump rope.  Sergio says that jumping rope will be lower impact than running, so I'm giving it try.  Only problem is that I'll have to go outside to jump rope since it's 9 feet long and hits everything/one around me in the living room.  NYC apartments are a little small for my tastes.  Then, we picked up Jackson on our way back to the apartment.  He's spending the night with us while his mom goes out on a date.  She'll pick him up sometime tomorrow.  So once we got here, we ordered pizza and watched  School of Rock  with Jack Black.  Cute movie and a must have for the teenage'd ones in your life.  That's my day in a nutshell - sadly I'm not leaving much out.  It's been that slow today.  And now I need to go scoop out Berg's litterbox so he doesn't dig a whole into the basement.

      Eeek! Yucky day here in the Big Apple. The buildings have all but disappeared across the street due to the fog. Everyone around me seems to be in a funky mood, including me. And it seems to be affecting my typing abilities. I could use a massage for sure. Chris & Sergio went out again last night for what has become their weekly ritual. They didn't get home until 5:30 am so I can only guess that they had a good time. Since I always have to work the next morning, I'm never invited to these little soirées. Oh, well. Don't cry over spilled milk, right?  I had the strangest dream last night. I was at a restaurant going up a set of stairs meant for the waitstaff (cause the elevator was broken) but on my way up, I changed my mind and headed back down. Then all of a sudden I was riding the stairs, which had turned into a Ferris wheel. There was some guy standing below smiling watching me ride and we were talking as I went past. Then I woke up. Don't know what that was all about.  Anyway, I wrote my rent check to Chris last night and on the memo line, I wrote "for sexual favors." He hasn't noticed yet, but I'm hoping that he does before he deposits the check today. Maybe someone at the bank will notice and give him a funny look. Tee Hee!! Goodness! We're supposed to go watch Starsky & Hutch this evening when I get home. Can't wait!! I love a good Ben Stiller/Owen Wilson movie!  My friend Olivia, who I work with, just walked by with her monkey wrapped up in her pashmina - or cape as we like to call it. (I guess I should first explain that she has a sock monkey that sits on her desk here at work.) I wished her and her new arrival well. She says she's going to breast feed him.  And something a little different: My 5 Gratitudes for Today:  1. Seeing my husband passed out in bed (finally) and he's still mostly on his side 2. The first sip of coffee this morning 3. Stepping outside at lunch to get a cup of 5-star gourmet chili for $6 4. Walking into my apt after a long day at work 5. Climbing into bed next to my hunny!

      Chris & I have started to go walking after work now that the weather is getting warmer.  We'd have gone running today, but I've just been way too tired after work for the last couple of days.  Next week.    So anyway, there's a lot of talk about how many of the widows from 9/11 are upset at Bush because he uses images of the destroyed WTC in a campaign commercial.  I find this issue a little tricky: it was certainly a historical event that took place during Bush's administration that he handled well, however it's wrong to use this personal tradegy as a political platform.  I would say that it seems like they could have found another way to tie the two together without using those images, but I went to the website and watched the video (entitled  urlLink Safer, Stronger ) and it's very well done and only on the screen for like 2 seconds.  I don't find it offensive at all, but then again, I didn't personally lose anyone on that Tuesday.  I was here that day and I can't say that it didn't effect me in a lingering way - still does to this day.  But Bush & Kerry are tied in  urlLink today's polls  and like I said yesterday, things are going to get nasty this year.  Well, in Texas, a woman gave  urlLink birth to her own grandchildren .  I guess it had to happen in the South, didn't it?  And I know I shouldn't find this funny, but I can't help but laugh! Seniors at a  urlLink retirement home in Florida  got into a fight at the salad bar over lettuce. Three people were hurt and had to be taken to the hospital for minor injuries - but it's just funny darn it!  This next one is just neat.  It's one of those things that would be fun to have, but you wouldn't want to admit spending money on.  Ooo!  I think  urlLink I want one !  And for the  urlLink courageous hampster  that is in a better place now.  May the dumbasses who launched you into the air have a backup plan next time around.  Can you imagine having a  urlLink famous feces  picture frame sitting on your desk at work?  OK, maybe not at work.  Alright, gonna go watch Friends, Will & Grace, The Apprentice, and Scrubs.  Later Gators.

      I've gone and done the unthinkable - I now have a piece of clothing that is pink. Only it's not too pink, but rather mauve. At least that's my story.  I can't believe I'm wearing pink - and I've actually gotten a load of compliments on it, too. Damn pink skirt. Now I'm going to have to wear it more often.  So I'm getting ready for work this morning and listening to the  urlLink news  when I hear this atrocious story of a 20-year-old woman in the Bronx whose heart was cut out after turning down her boyfriend's marriage proposal on Valentine's Day. Can you say fecked up? Also, in the news, it seems we'll be seeing a Kerry/Bush face-off later this year in the  presidential elections. I guess I can't say that I didn't see that one coming. Still doesn't mean that I like Kerry all that much.   It seems that an individual or group is trying to  urlLink blackmail the French government . They sent a letter saying there were 10 bombs hidden throughout the state-run railway system and they would be detonated unless they were paid over $5 million. French police have already discovered one of the bombs and defused it saying that it was a very sophisticated bomb. All I can say is that I hope they find all of those bombs before we roll through there in September.

      Well boys & girls, I've finally found out that Dick Clark is 74 years old!  The world's oldest teenager they call him. I wonder just how much work he's had done . . . Oh well, I'm sure Joan Rivers is catching up to him anyway.  Nothing really new on this fine day here in the Big Apple. I read Court's blog and I found her French wedding experience very interesting indeed. I can't believe that they start the reception so late in the evening - and there are 2 of them! Oh! And the fact that marriage is a civil union at the courthouse with no big frills - onto the religious ceremony with barely any frills. They must save it all for that 2nd reception that lasts until the break of dawn.  Big shout out to one of my favorite new blogs:  urlLink Rita ! Kick ass stuff girl, kick ass! Don't know if I'd ever give possum stew a try, but you never know just what you'll eat when you're hungry enough - or you don't know what that mystery meat is in the stew. But in case any of you are missing out on the recipe of possum stew,  urlLink here it is !  I hope to add more of the blog addresses that I visit on a regular basis to the list on the right very soon.

      I wanted to get on the computer yesterday to post, but I was busier than a one-armed paperhanger. And I don't know why I'm so frustrated today, but I think it's going to get better as the day goes on. It is so absolutely beautiful outside today that I don't see how I could stay in a rotten mood. Normally, I go downstairs to get lunch and then come right back to my desk to eat, but I just couldn't today. So Dawn and I ate outside at Rockefeller Center right next to the skating rink, but above 1 level. Beautiful!!  So I went to see The Passion of the Christ again yesterday and it is a phenomenal movie. Please go see this movie! If nothing else, it brings a human aspect to the story of Christ - something that I think was missing during all of my years in catechism. Some people cried, some didn't, some flinched each time Jesus was beaten, some didn't, and some couldn't  take it at all and left the theater. Each moviegoer had a different experience and this is the type of movie that makes you reflect. Just what a good - I mean GREAT - movie should do. Fantastic job, Mel Gibson, fantastic job!  Good news is you are obese and you've done something drastic to help lower your weight - you can  urlLink deduct it from your taxes ! But since I'm not a tax consultant, please don't reference this site when you get a knock on your door from the IRS. You are not my child and I will not take responsibility for your tax shortcomings. Frankly, the IRS scares the hell out of me.  Here's something you don't see everyday: A town in Vermont,  urlLink Killington , wants to succeed from Vermont and join New Hampshire. Wild! I haven't heard of any sort of succession since the Civil War, and well, technically, I didn't hear that directly.

      I love Thursdays!  And even though it's payday, I'm still broke since my rent money comes out of this paycheck.  And to top it all off, I opened up our rent invoice and our monthly rent went up by $98.  No notice or anything which pretty much sucks.  Rent nearly kills me & I hear they may raise subway fares!  They're bleeding us dry!  NYC had a budget surplus of like $4 million at least - you'd think they would help the straphangers out since they raised fares not even a year ago!  Ahhh!  Geez!!  Assholes!  Whew!  I'm glad I got that off my chest!  Berg is being evil as usual.  He's scratching on the chair, the movies on the shelf, the couch, the front door, the closet door, the mattress - everywhere except one of his two scratching posts.  Go figure.  Chris & Sergio are going out tonight to The Whiskey Bar.  Chris hasn't been in a couple of weeks.  It was time.  I've been telling Chris that he needs to go to the doctor for his chronic indigestion.  He has stubbornly refused.  As a matter of fact, we just went back and forth with me trying to get him to go and him saying, "I don't want to go because of needles.  If they can do something without needles, I'll definitely go."  At this point, I assured him that there's a really good chance they won't have to draw blood or anything, but since I didn't say "100% sure," that's not really good enough for him.  I was turned down.  He's stubborn and hard-headed for sure.

      I felt compelled to post this  urlLink next link  after hearing about it on the news this morning and then receiving the link in my email from a cousin - well, Chris's cousin to be exact (Thanks Dub!!)  Anyway, this guy is divorced and found his ex's  urlLink wedding dress  when he was moving.  Long story short, he is selling it on eBay.  He's even modeled the gown himself and his comments are absolutely hilarious.  Please,  urlLink go and enjoy !  You'll love it, too!  Not so much happening today.  We went to the UCB last night and it was hilarious!  We stayed for 1 1/2 shows - I was getting a little ancy(sp?) toward the end.  Today, Chris signed up for his Level 2 classes at UCB.  His graduation performance is in a couple of weeks & I know he'll do great!  I'm proud of him for taking these classes because he truly enjoys them.

      Here's a little something you don't see in the news these days:  urlLink Explorers are planning a quest to Turkey's Mt. Ararat in search of Noah's Ark . Biblical stories have placed the Ark near this location, however, past expeditions never turned up any evidence. Then in last summer's heat wave that hit Europe, "a mammoth structure" was exposed and thanks to satellite imagery, they've been able to pinpoint a more exact location. I think it would be very exciting if they found a boat-like structure up there. It would certainly boost a lot of people's faith.  I was reading on ABCnews.com about a family of 7 who eats on less than $12/day. They now actually run a business from their home that teaches others how to do the same thing. I found it an interesting read, so  urlLink click here  to read their story or  urlLink click here  to go straight to their website.   And I just read this story on  urlLink CNN.com  about a guy who is attending NYU, but couldn't afford to pay a $1000 housing deposit so he's been living in one of the school's libraries for the last 8 months. He kept an online journal ( urlLink homelessatnyu.com ), which is how school officials discovered him and then moved him to a free dorm room. Very interesting since I read a book not that long ago where a girl lived in the school library as well.  There is a report our on  urlLink SmokingGun.com  about an assistant writer for "Friends" who has filed a lawsuit against 3 of the writers. She claimed they were lewd in their actions and comments and frequently spoke of the actors/actresses in a lewd (read sexual) fashion. But, please, go check it out for yourself.  Ok, so now Chris & I are off to go to Herald Night at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater.  It's a cheap night of hilarious entertainment - only $5 per person during the week & only $8 per person on the weekends.  I can't think of anything cheaper in NYC.  Except for my Goodwill Dress.  About 4 years ago, Easter snuck up on me and I didn't have a dress to wear or really any money to buy it with.  I could have asked my Mom & Dad to buy me one, but I thought I should at least give it a shot.  I stopped by Goodwill looking for a cool purse, throw pillows or scarves when I glanced at the rack of dresses.  I found a nice little red dress that is sleeveless with a red paisley design on a chiffon-like material over a red sheath that goes to my knees.  Marked at $5 (read: affordable), I brought it to the register and low & behold, it's on sale 1/2 price.  That's right, my $5 dress was now a mere $2.50.  I still own that red dress and I get compliments every time I wear it.  It's probably the cheapest since item of clothing that I have & it's what I get the most compliments on.  I'm confused.  I still wear it because it's so comfortable and is wrinkle resistant.  I can ball it up, toss it in a bag and it's fine.  Again, confused but I'm Ok with that.  It's my Goodwill Dress.

      I would just like to celebrate the fact that I am now a SLIMY MOLLUSC in the Blogosphere!!  And that's all I can say about that for now.  I wanted to post all of the different levels, but I'm too tired to look.  Not much happening in the wide world of Cooper today.  It got cold again - go figure.  I wish it would just turn warm already!  I'm tired of this cold, overcast, rainy crap that is 2004.  OK, I have to go start dinner because Chris is refusing to do anything until I'm standing next to him breathing on his neck.  And since I'm pretty damn hungry and he's cutting the chicken, I have to make a choice here . . .

      Well, instead of SoHo/East Village, Chris & I wandered aimlessly around Greenwich Village.  I absolutely love this part of the city.  It just has an energy to it that our current neighborhood in Astoria (or all of Queens for that matter) simply lacks.  One of the things Chris received when his grandmother passed away was an old pipe that his grandfather used to smoke.  So while we wandered around yesterday, he picked up a pack of vanilla pipe tobacco along with one of those little cleaning tools.  He smoked when he got home.  It didn't stink like most pipes stink thanks to the vanilla, though I must say that it was a little weird to see him smoke a pipe.  While we were out and about yesterday, we also explored the shops at the new Time Warner Center.  Nice place and very clean.  That's about all I have to say about that.  Most stores exceeded my budget.  We went into one lady's clothing store where everything was somewhat expensive, but what I noticed is that for as costly as they were, most of them were falling apart.  Call me crazy, but why would I pay $425 for a sun dress when the straps are no longer attached the garment and the ends are now all frayed.  Perhaps their manager should do a floor check and weed out some of the damaged pieces.  Perhaps I simply won't shop there & I shouldn't worry about it.  Now today, Amanda and I are supposed to go to Herald Square to find her something to wear to her sister's baby shower.  After that, we might go see Jersey Girl.  Ok, so I need to go take a shower now & rid myself of this funk.

      Chris & I went to see Kill Bill: Vol 2 last night and it was great!  Not as bloody as the first one, but it tied up all ends in a nice little package.  I definitely recommend it, but please watch Vol. 1 before seeing Vol. 2.  That's just the way these things work, people.  Weekend Links:   urlLink Classic SNL skit on how to deal with your child being gay .  Hilarious!  Now here are a series of cartoons by the creators of South Park - need I say they are dirty, contain nudity & obviously not appropriate to watch during "working hours" unless of course you think you're a badass and can get away with it.  Just remember: the IT department is watching!!   urlLink Cartoon #1    urlLink Cartoon #2   And now for something you can share with your whole family:  urlLink Escher's "Relativity" in Legos .  Pretty cool, but I wonder how long it took them to do this.  I'm sure I'm going to hell for putting this next link on here, but I simply couldn't resist.  It's the  urlLink Jesus Christ action figure playset .  Cross not included.   urlLink THE WARNING SIGNS OF MASTURBATION .  Sponsored by your local White House.  What frightens me on this one is that this website looks so official, yet very obvious it's completely satirical.  Please correct me if I'm wrong on this one.  OK, that's enough for today.  Hopefully more links will follow tomorrow.  Today's plan is to wander aimlessly around the SoHo/East Village part of Manhattan today since it is such a beautiful day!

      Today's meme is pretty simple:  1. Pick up the nearest book. 2. Open to page 23. 3. Post the 5th sentence and these instructions.   Tomorrow she goes to Mercy.   from The True And Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters by Elisabeth Roginson

      Talk to me baby Say something nice Talk to me honey I need your advice  Never mind fortune Never mind fame I don't wear diamonds I don't drink champagne  So, what's that song?  Can you guess it?  Let's see if anyone gets this one right.  Otherwise, I'm sitting here wasting some time.  I need to do laundry tonight, but it was kind of busy at the laudromat when I walked past it on my way home.  So I figure I'll wait until about 6:45 or 7 pm and then give it a shot.  Last night & tonight are free dryer nights so there are always tons of people fighting for dryers.  You only save like $2 to $3 and I would rather pay extra so I don't have to fight others for machines, but we are completely out of towels and my underwear selection is starting to thin out.  Interestingly enough, I was having this same conversation with one of my coworkers and she said that she only does laundry like once a month.  My jaw nearly hit the floor, but she explained that most of their clothes go to the dry cleaner.  Insane!  I wish I only had to do laundry once a month, but then I would hate to see my dry cleaner bill.  Chris is napping on the couch after having a late night.  He only got like 3 hours of sleep before he dragged himself (with my help) out of bed and into the shower.  I've been up since before 5 am, but I don't do naps well.  I usually wake up very cranky & moody and then I just feel like shit.  He also had one too many whiskeys.  I've certainly been there before.  "Dear God, please don't let me throw up.  I promise I won't drink on an empty stomach again."  I'm sure I've heard those words come out of my mouth at least once . . .  Ok, off to do laundry.  Wish me luck!

      Ok, so I have another new layout.  Drop me a comment if you can't read the text or if you have any other problems.  And I added pictures to the Gallery 3 link on the right from Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah's trip.  I'm afraid the text will have to come later since I'm having trouble with the text editor for that website.

      So not much happening tonight.  Chris went to Peter Luger's Steakhouse in Brooklyn with some of his friends from the hotel.  I opted out tonight since 1) I wasn't aware it was tonight, and 2) I really didn't feel like going.  I'm still recovering from this weekend.  I feel kind of bad for not going, but I really was somewhat blindsided by it even though Chris insists that he told me about this on Saturday.  Unfortunately, I was busier than a one armed paper hanger on Saturday.     urlLink This link  will make you somewhat crazy.  Don't really know what it has to do with epilepsy, but that's what the site says anyway.  Well, the  urlLink world's oldest mouse  celebrated his 4th birthday this past Saturday.  He is the equivalent of 136 in human years.  Happy Birthday Yoda!  And as it turns out,  urlLink Abe Vigoda is alive  today.  Who'd have guessed?  This next story tugs at my heart.  This cat now named  urlLink China, was trapped in a cardboard shipping box  for 30 days.  It somehow got trapped in a box that contained bird cages from China.  It traveled by ship to the West Coast and then by rail to Tampa where it was found.  When they brought it to the vet, it only weighed about 3 pounds.  Yes, I'm a cat person.  Here are more  urlLink pictures  from someone who had spare time and photoshop on their computer.  Interesting & freaky all at the same time - especially the  urlLink 4th picture down .    And finally, here is some of the  urlLink coolest code art ever !  Just click on the names on the left.  Cool, huh?  Oh!  I simply cannot leave without singing the praises of this group of  urlLink Roman Catholic schoolgirls .  I guess they were tired of looking at his willie.

      I would say "sorry" for the lack of posts, but I've had a damn good time with my guests since they got here on Thursday.  Now our apartment is entirely too quiet so Chris has decided to run his power tools to help mask the void.  Ruthie (Chris's mom), Cacky (his sister), and Savannah (Cacky's youngest at 16 months) came in on Thursday afternoon.  Once they got here, we visited a bit and made dinner.  Then we had us a little ceremony of sorts.  When Chris's grandmother passed away, they divided her belongings amongst the children.  In the end, they had some of her jewelry that they turned into rings for the granddaughters - and I got one, too.  Mine is a ruby that came from a 40-Anniversary wedding gift that her husband gave her.  It's so pretty and I'm very touched that I was included cause one day, I hope to have a little girl to pass along the ring.  I love sentimental gifts.  They mean more than any expensive gift in some bright shiny store.  Chris also received his granddaddy's walking cane and some of his watches.  During their stay, we hit Chinatown up to Prince Street, Columbus Circle, Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Central Park (picnic), Rockefeller Center/Midtown area, Jeckyl & Hyde Club, City Lobster & Crab Company, The Brooklyn Diner, Ricky's (adult store - and yes, purchases were made but those stories shall be told another time), The Upright Citizens Brigade, and shopping, shopping, shopping & shopping!!!  They left the apartment at 4:15 this morning.  I miss them already, but Berg is really upset he doesn't have his choice of luggage to lay on and roll around.  He's currently taking out his aggression on one of my chairs.  The bastard.  By the way, I will be changing the layout soon to something that everyone can read.  Ok, I have to go watch the end of Fear Factor - they had to do some pretty disgusting stuff on Day Two.

      We just booked our trip to Italy baby!!  Whoo hoo!!  3 nights in Rome, 3 nights in Florence & 3 nights in Venice!  I'm so excited!  Neither Chris nor I have been to Europe - or taken a vacation together for that matter.  This will be just after our 2 year anniversary.  Yeah!!  Interesting little tidbit: the national debt clock that hangs in Union Square here in NYC has been taken down. The building where it was hung is being demolished. It will be replaced with a new higher-tech clock next month and hung about a block north. When the clock was taken down, the national debt was more than $7 trillion.  Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah are coming tomorrow!! I so can't wait! Bring on the Yaya good times!!  I've recently discovered (about a month ago)  urlLink this website  that is more political than I'll ever be on my site.  I've enjoyed  urlLink his posts  so far. His post today is about John Kerry and the purple hearts he received for injuries while serving in the military. Check it out. I think you'll definitely see Kerry in a new light; an unflattering new light.  I stopped by  urlLink Dooce's  site today and read about how she is going through postpartum depression. After reading her story, my heart goes out to her. I wish there was some way that I could help out. After reading her blog everyday, I feel like I know her. I simply wish there was an easy fix for depression, but I know there isn't. I must say that's something that scares me about getting pregnant. I've gone through my own funk a time or two, but never to the extent that she has. But she's a strong person and she'll make it through and then teach us all a lesson in return.  Not much else is happening here in my little world. It's been raining since Monday. I'll be going to pick up our visitors tomorrow from the airport. Chris will have to meet us at the apartment cause he won't make it to the airport in time. My only concern is that the 2-hour live season finale of The Apprentice is tomorrow night and I desperately want to watch it. I may have to tape it, if the boys aren't playing video games. I seriously hope they're not playing video games.

      I'm not sure if anyone caught the Nick & Jessica Variety Show on Sunday night, but I did. I think the thing that drew me in was that I missed out on the heydays of variety shows. I was too young. So I watched with baited breath and I laughed at times and other times I realized it was all a little corny. But now that I've seen the first show, I'm wondering what they'll do different for the next show. Since it comes on Sunday nights, I'm sure I'll be watching it again due to the lack of quality programming offered during that timeslot. If you haven't watched it, check it out and let me know what you think. I read an article on MSNBC.com this morning that said the show was the highest rated during that timeslot Sunday night. Should be interesting to see if they can pull it off again.  Anyway, Chris & I went to Bed Bath & Beyond after I got off work today.  Bought us: a halogen lamp (all brushed steel like), a fogless shower mirror so we can stare at ourselves at random, 3 ice cube trays, a can opener that cuts the can so there are no sharp edges (of course), and some hangers for my skirts (cause I can't wear pants to work).  At just under $150 later, we took a cab home.  The cabbie had such horrible body odor that I almost choked.  Which reminds me, this guy sat next to me on the train this morning and he smelled like vinegar and eggs.  N-A-S-T-Y!  Nasty!!

      BTW, I found this link on one of the blogs I read daily.   urlLink Anne of In A Puddle  has started a project to record the voice of random bloggers just like us.  It's really cool and I think I'll do it in a few days time.  Need to think of something to say so I don't sound like a complete dork.  If you're interested,  urlLink click here  and then click on the link to listen to  urlLink Ann of In A Puddle .  She'll give you instructions.  Hope to hear you soon!!

      So in case you're totally oblivious, I've got a new layout.  I certainly like it better than the old one.  Hope you like it and don't find it too confusing.  Let me know in the comments box if you find something isn't working.  I'll do my best to fix it.

      HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!!  Since you've all been good boys & girls, you get . . . . . LINKS!!  Had you fooled, didn't I?  This is pretty cool cause the  urlLink bunny  won't let go of your cursor until you shake him off.  Appropriate for Easter I think.  Then, of course, there is the  urlLink milk rap commercial  brought to you by the dairy farmers of Ontario.  Unique to say the least.  Takes a bit to load, but funny.  This must be one of the best  urlLink rush posters  I've seen.  Leave it to the  urlLink TKE's .  And if you'd like to know the difference between Europeans and Italians, just  urlLink click here .  OK, that's it cause there weren't that many good ones today.  HAPPY EASTER!

       urlLink Interesting .  I can't even think of anything else to describe, but I couldn't watch for too long or my eyeballs were gonna fall out.   urlLink Cool, though, very cool .  If only my office was the kind where we could pull something like  urlLink this .  Awesome guys!  Awesome!  Cool video of a  urlLink one-legged guy dancing his ass off .  He does more with one leg than most white people do with two.  And this is a totally gross " urlLink brief safe " complete with skid marks.  Fantastic!  This - This is insane!  It's a  urlLink thorax cake  which bled different sauces.  Here's hoping someone I know will be incredibly cool and make this one day because they have nothing better to do with their time.  Seems like it would take quite a while to do.  Ok, off to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

      Do you know your  urlLink pimp name ?  I do.  My  urlLink pimp name  is  Macktastic empress Dogg  - and don't you forget it.  And while we're at it, do you know your  urlLink porn name ?  Surprisingly, I do.  My porn name is  Honey Lips , but then I chose a random identity and got  Serenity Fox , which I like too.  If Chris ever gets a hairy chest, I'm doing  urlLink this  to him.  I found this cool website for a hotel in Berlin that has the coolest rooms!  Check it out by  urlLink clicking here .  Awesome, isn't it?   I personally found  urlLink this  a little offensive since it resembles Berg, but others may  urlLink find it funny .  And then, of course, there is  urlLink Dionne Warwick's Cosmic Peephole .  Fun and doesn't cost a thing.  This is a pretty  urlLink funny beer ad  that I don't think I've ever seen on TV.  Enjoy!  If only beers really did that.  Takes a little bit to load, but worth it.

      Stomach growling, feeling faint, must eat soon . . . so, I'm a little hungry and about to make some chicken alfredo pasta cause I'm a badass.  And Chris will love it - except that I forgot to get the kind of pasta that he loves, but tough shit.  I'm not getting dressed again to go back down to the store in the cold and the wind.  April in NYC - ain't it grand?  While I'm sitting here typing, The Rock is on Conan O'Brien and it reminded me to tell everyone: Chris met The Rock last week when he was staying at The Mandarin Oriental (hotel).  Interestingly enough, he checked in under the name of "Mr. Cook."  He only stayed like 1 night and then moved on.  I could eat him with a spoon!  Visitor update: Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah are coming up on the 15th for 4 days.  Becca & Trevor are coming up at the end of May for her 21st birthday.  Then, Brad & Adrianna are coming up at the end of June and, last but not least, there is a possibility that we'll get to see our friend Hiroshi after summer when he flies in from Las Vegas to visit a friend here in NYC.  That's it so far this year.    Oh!  The piece de resistance (of course) is our upcoming trip to Italy.  We've finally narrowed it down to staying in just Italy: 3 days in Rome, 3 days in Florence (with a day trip to Pisa), and 3 days in Venice.  I SO can't wait!  Chris and I have never been to Europe - hell, I don't think we've ever really taken a trip together by ourselves!  And that's saying a lot considering we've been together for 9 years (married 2 and a half years).  Ok, off to make dinner so I can EAT!!

      I'm doing my laundry today and the laundromat is 2 1/2 blocks away.  A few moments ago, I went back to put the clothes into the dryer.  On my way, this old man comes out of his apartment building wearing NOTHING but a thin navy blue robe.  NOTHING else.  NOTHING.  Anyway, he then asks me if I wanted to come clean his apartment.  I declined and told him I was doing my laundry, but thanks anyway.  So he asks me if I wanted to come do laundry in his apartment.  Ok, so "No thanks, I'm kind of busy.  But thanks."  WTF?!?

      Well, the Met was great!  If you're ever in NYC, it's a must see - even before the American History Museum, which is usually packed to capacity.  The Met was easier to get into (shorter lines) and they have a coat check.  Very nice!  Chris & I spent 3 hours there and only saw part of the 1st floor and a very small part of the 2nd floor.  But one of the places we saw on the 2nd floor was just row after row of objects behind glass.  There was virtually no one else up there and it almost felt like we weren't supposed to be there.  Like we discovered some secret part of the museum.  It was absolutely fantastic - and this from someone who's not a big "art" fan, but it certainly wasn't just paintings.  There was so much more!  Anyway, more on that later.  I'm sill downloading pictures and I hope to post some to one of the picture galleries.  Of course since everything was pretty much behind glass, you'll see our reflections in a few of them.  Oh!  And it was cool in the American Wing portion because they had these rooms that you could walk through that were set up just like those that would be typical of Virginia or Massachusetts or Maine in the late 1800's.  Gorgeous!!  Ok, enough!  Cause here are your links!!!  I know you're smiling and that makes me happy!  So, here you go:  This is just a strange story - almost sci-fi like:  urlLink Woman Grows Extra Breasts .  And not in a good way either!  And now,  urlLink The Rainbow Plucking Orgy .  This was a children's cartoon that was broadcast in the 70's and 80's.  I think it has a completely different connotation now and certainly wouldn't have made it on air.  It's hard to keep a straight face watching it.  OK, that's all for now.  I need to go do laundry.  More later.

      If I can get Chris out of bed, showered & dressed, then we're going to the Metropolitan Musuem of Art today.  Don't think I'm being cruel - this was his idea.  He went to go see Hellboy last night and I opted to sit out of this one.  For some reason, comic book movies simply don't grab me.  I'm sure I'm not the only soul walking the planet who thinks this way.  Wow!  I just woke the man up!  Time for some morning lovin'!  After he brushes his teeth that is.

      Some great links for ya:   urlLink The Excorcist in 30 seconds - with bunnies .  Absolutely fantastic & hilarious, but I'd suggest turning the volume down on your computer lest you go deaf.  I'm sure most parents discourage  urlLink playing with food , but this I might actually encourage.  Don't know what this article is actually about since the headline is the coolest part!!   urlLink Click here !   urlLink Check out this link .  That's right!  They have hyenas on leashes.  Yep, hyenas.  And if you haven't been able to  urlLink slap a ho  in a while, have no fear - just  urlLink click here .  I, myself, am a Super Pimp!  Beat that!  And I'm sorry, Chris, but this is the  urlLink biggest penis  I think I've ever seen!  Even bigger than that donkey's penis in front of Mrs. Jackie's house!  This is kinda fun for all of you familiar with the hip hop world.  It's the  urlLink Hip Hop Adventure !  Ok, I think you've had enough for today.  But I couldn't leave you with the last link, so here you go.   urlLink I think I want this for my birthday !  December 1st (hint, hint!!)  It'll make the work day go faster!

      I've been working at the same job for the last 2 years and 8 months. I'm basically the middle-manwoman for an investment portfolio. 75% of the investors in this portfolio are elderly and when they call up for information or forms, they expect things to be done rather quickly because, as they often remind me, they may die soon. At this point, they usually pause and I really never know what to say: "Yep, so you'd better hurry up and cash that check. You could die later today even!" Yeah, that never really seems to blow over, so I usually just give them a monotone "Yes sir or Yes ma'am" and leave it at that. Every once in a while, I get a screamer on the phone. This person wants to know why they don't get more money and why I'm not doing something about them getting more money - all while screaming angrily into the phone. I've even been cussed at.  I had a nice change from the norm the other day when a 75-year-old lady called me to change the name on her account. She was telling me all about her friend of 31 years who passed away and all of the things they used to do. She was laughing and carrying on; I must have talked to her for 30 minutes. Well, when she sent the paperwork back to me, it smelled of stale cigarettes but it also included a nice card. She wrote that it was the first time she laughed in 6 months. Made me feel all nice and gooey inside. I think I'll frame that card.  I got this next little funny from  urlLink DaGoddess  and I simply couldn't resist since it made me laugh out loud at my computer monitor. Needless to say, I got a few strange looks! Here goes:  It was opening night at the Orpheum and the Amazing Claude was topping the bill. People came from miles around to see the famed hypnotist do his stuff. As Claude took to the stage, he announced, "Unlike most stage hypnotists who invite two or three people up onto the stage to be put into a trance, I intend to hypnotize each and every member of the audience."  The excitement was almost electric as Claude withdrew a beautiful antique pocket watch from his coat. "I want you each to keep your eye on this antique watch. It's a very special watch. It's been in my family for six generations."  He began to swinging the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting, "Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch . . . ."  The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until suddenly, it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces. "Shit!" said they hypnotist.  It took three weeks to clean up the theater.

      I'm fucked up!  And Chris the Great is turning the AC on cause he's a badass.  Today is Becca's birthday.  A Marine bought us each a shot of Yagermeister (sp?) and I think we're all fucked up!  And my  brother-in-law, John, is a badass, too!  Anyway, after the Met, we went to PJ Carnie's and had a couple of drinks a few appetizers.  Then, we went to Faces & Names and had a few more drinks and a dish of curly fries.  That's when the Marine bought us the drinks.   We've had a good day & I must go since I can't type cause I'm too fucked up!  Later gators!!

      My little sister is here!!  Which is why I haven't posted since Wednesday.  Well, that's not entirely true.  On Thursday night, we had a going away party for a couple of people at work.  I would have done fine with my Corona beers until the shot of Yagermeister & the shot of Jack Daniel's.  It's the shots that kick my ass.  So I was late for work on Friday, but I get points for at least making it.  Right?  Yeah, well, points for me anyway!  Becca and Trevor came in Friday evening around 6 pm and then hit Times Square, Rockefeller Center & walked up 5th Avenue up to Central Park South.  We've also seen Battery Park, the WTC site, the Wall Street Bull, Chinatown, SoHo, the East Village, Central Park, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, and Grand Central.  And today:  HAPPY 21st BIRTHDAY BECCA!!  So today, we're obviously going to do a little drinking after we go to The Met (museum).  I made her some chocolate cupcakes for breakfast & her boyfriend, Trevor, just went and got her some flowers - she's in the shower right now so she'll be surprised when she gets out.  OK, gotta go!

      I can't decide if this is a  urlLink music video or porn , so please, judge for yourself.  This is not appropriate for work or small children & you need volume for the full affect.  I just don't know what to say about it.  Please, someone give me that word I'm so desperately looking for here . . . something besides  urlLink Tralala .  And following along the same lines, here's this  urlLink snazzy ad for a cell phone company .  Nice work, guys, nice work.  And  urlLink this is fantastic !  It makes me want to get up and dance just like that!

      Tonight is the big finale for American Idol. I didn't watch the first 2 seasons and the only reason I tuned in this season was because they cancelled Buffy. So really, what's a girl to do?   I couldn't let this headline pass by without comment:  urlLink Spanky the Circus Clown Charged With Child Porn . Ok, I think the name "Spanky" should have sent up red flags to start with.  I just tried to get our passports and had one of the most confusing conversations I think I've ever had.  I think I might need to get my hearing checked.  That's probably my problem right there, but I'm actually afraid I'll need hearing aids or something & I'm just too young for that.  It's really frustrating when you can't hear people.  I think I know how my Dad feels sometimes.  Anyway, I did the unthinkable yesterday: I unleashed Chris the Great in Best Buy unsupervised.  I don't know what I was thinking.  He came back with one movie in particular:  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep .  It was one of the craziest, funniest movies I've seen in a long time!  I'd recap, but I'm not sure I would even know where to start.  It's a great movie so go see it!!  I just went to  urlLink Rita's site , took  urlLink this quiz  and found out that I'm a CENTRIST, which means: Centrists favor selective government intervention and emphasize practical solutions to current problems. They tend to keep an open mind on new issues. Many centrists feel that government serves as a check on excessive liberty.    Ok, so now what?

      I saw a poll on CNN.com that asked who had a better plan for Iraq: Bush, Kerry or Nader. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Kerry hasn't even announced a plan for Iraq, has he? If so, I haven't heard a single thing about it.  After stopping off at  urlLink Rita's  site, I came across  urlLink this article and photo . Sponsored by MoveOn.org, it has (of course) been linked to the Kerry campaign which doesn't surprise me. I can tell you now I'll probably never ever support MoveOn - especially after seeing this bullshit.  That's it!! I don't know what's wrong with the world today! I couldn't believe my eyes when I read that  urlLink Western Washington University cancelled its annual Pornfest . I mean, what's wrong with us if we can't enjoy a little porn in a group setting? Who else will sponsor condom hunts and self-gratification information booths?!?

      Since I didn't get a chance to post last night, you get an early bird post.  Unfortunately, not really much to post right now.  Chris & I are going to apply for our passports today, I think.  We were supposed to go yesterday, but he had a meeting after work and I can't seem to find a passport office that stays open past 4 pm.  I'm going to have to take off a little early either today or tomorrow to get things done.  Swell.  On the up side, I'm seriously looking forward to Becca & Trevor coming up Friday!  I think I'm mainly ready to do a little bar hopping, but who really knows.  In an effort to help brighten your day,  urlLink click here  to read a blog by an intern having an affair with a Congressman.  I haven't gotten too into it yet, but I'm sure I'll have at least an hour on my hands today to explore a little.  And one more before I go:  urlLink 213 Things Skippy Is No Longer Allowed To Do In The US Army .  Enjoy my little ones, enjoy!

      Think you have a bad neighbor?   urlLink Check this out .  I just saw my neighbor a moment ago when I took the trash out.  She said that I'm always cleaning, but after see  urlLink that guy's apartment , I feel the need to go clean some more.  And I love rollercoasters just as much as the next person, but after  urlLink checking out this page , I'll think twice about wearing some itty bitty shorts on that next coaster.  I've seen plenty of cottonfields, beanfields and cornfields in my lifetime but never a  urlLink concrete cornfield .  Strangely serene.  This is a slightly different variation of the  urlLink McDonald's ebonics ad  that was sent around a few years back.  Nice and short so the guilt doesn't last too long.   urlLink Click here for some really cool street art .  OK, off to clean something.

      I will now be referring to Chris as Chris the Great.  Why?  Because his hands built the world, baby!  I came home at lunch today because I was so exhausted.  After eating some lunch, I took a 2 hour nap.  I NEVER take naps.  Ever.  So it was a little strange.  Maybe I'm coming down with something.  Oh well.  Your gain because I feel like doing a little link whorage today:   urlLink Can you imagine not know what sex is ?  Now try to imagine being married for 8 years and then going to a fertility clinic because they haven't been able to have a child.  Why, you ask?  Because they've never had sex and had no idea what it was.  Very, very strange - especially in this day and age!  This is one of the silliest inventions I think I've ever seen.   urlLink It's a foil sleeve for driver's who put one arm out of the window as they drive.   It kind of defeats the purpose.  Just what every new couple needs to compliment their bedroom -  urlLink a quilt made out of Crown Royal bags .  I think I'll skip this one, thanks.   urlLink Another strange website that follows your mouse .  Interesting, but not as fancy as some we've seen in the past.   urlLink Can you spot the differences ?  I must admit that I'm not the best at it, but it's still fun.   urlLink This is an interesting take on an online clock.  Kind of nice .

      I was so freaking stressed out today over finding Chris's state-certified birth certificate so that we could get our passports.  And in the back of my mind, I thought I would be OK and there wasn't really a reason to worry this much, but I couldn't stop myself from stressing out.  Anyway, long story short, I got home & found his birth certificate in the place I put all of my important papers.  Who would've thought to look in the very place it should have been in the first place?  Go figure.  I think I may get a chance to go see a Broadway show sometime soon.   A Boy From Oz  starring Hugh Jackman is on the top of the list, but all of this is tentative.  Some exciting news: my oldest sister, Bridget, who was just here visiting, will be graduating from LSU with her masters degree in Marketing.  Our family is going down to see her and everything.  I wish I were there!  So to Bridget:   CONGRATULATIONS!!  WE'RE PROUD OF YOU!

      Well, my sister came and went. She flew in Sunday evening and left this morning. I spent the last 2 nights with her at her hotel near Wall Street and it's kind of strange to stay in a hotel in the same town where you live. As a matter of fact, I haven't even been home since Sunday so I'm seriously looking forward to going home, putting on my pj's and sitting my ass in front of the computer to catch up on everything I've missed. However, I'm pretty sure there are still dishes left over from Sunday night's dinner waiting for me to wash. My work is never done.  Since I wasn't home Monday to blog, I need to get this off my chest:  HAPPY (belated) BIRTHDAY MOM!!  Monday was her 53rd birthday and she ended up working late. Just what she wanted, I'm sure. I did call her on her birthday, but I also like to announce this sort of thing to my entire of audience of 2 people, so there you go.  I can't help but comment on the  urlLink $1000 omelet . That's right, I said  urlLink $1000 OMELET . You can find this little treasure consisting of eggs, lobster, 10 ounces of caviar, and a few trimmings at Norma's restaurant in Le Parker Meridien hotel on West 57th Street. But if you'd rather just read all about it,  urlLink click here . I hear that only 1 person has ordered it so far: a British journalist. I wonder how that looks on his expense account. I'm sure it's a little more than what his daily allowance would cover.   urlLink This next article I found is fascinatingly odd . This guy slathered his entire hotel room - tv, bed, towels, doors, carpets, etc. - in about 14 jars of Vaseline. They found him at another hotel covered from head to toe in - you guessed it, Vaseline!! They also found pornographic materials in the trashcan in the first hotel room.  I found this on  urlLink Sheila O'Malley's  site and I think it's pretty funny considering I'm not a big Kerry fan.  urlLink It's a picture of his daughter in a completely see-thru dress - nipples, underwear and not much else.

      Have you ever had a time when your significant other treated you like a goddess (or god)?  Welcome to my Saturday night!!  Of course, I think it was because of my hair.  Let me explain: Yesterday, I had a hair appointment - touch up my highlights and a cut.  Well, the place I go to always straightens my hair before they cut it.  It's just something they do.  My hair is naturally wavy with a side of frizziness that Chris is always commenting on.  So when I emerge with straight-as-a-board blond hair, his heart went a flutter.  He treated me like a queen the rest of the day - not that he treats me like a slave girl any other time.  Of course, I may have to start straightening my hair more often.  I'll leave out all the details, but let's say no one had trouble falling asleep!  But to bring your mind out of the gutter for a moment, I'll tell you about our evening after we left the hair salon.  We walked from 32nd Street btw 5th Ave and Madison over to 40th Street and 7th Ave (I think) to go to Midtown Comics.  Low and behold who do we run into but Chris's sister, Cindy, and her boyfriend, John.  Hugs, hello's & comic book discussions ensued and then we all headed over to 9th Avenue for a food festival!!  Yum!!  They, of course, have every kind of food at these festivals and wouldn't you know it we found a place (The Delta Grill on 48th & 9th) that was selling boiled crawfish and crawfish ettoufee.  Yes, we got one of each and beer.  Unfortunately, the boiled crawfish were tiny and it was bland as all get out, but it was nice to be able to peel and suck a few on the streets of Manhattan.  After our mudbug orgy, Chris and I walked back to Times Square and headed home.  Great day!!  Now, for the exciting part of today:  BRIDGET IS ON HER WAY TO NYC!!!  Her first time to come visit and I'm meeting her at the airport at 4 pm.  I'm very excited!!  Unfortunately, I need to get off my ass and get busy cleaning this place.  Too much playing around yesterday leads to hurried cleaning today.  My apartment isn't too, too bad, but it's certainly not spotless.  Wish me luck!  Oh!  I went back to the Haloscan comments because I didn't want to loose what everyone has contributed, so comment away!!

      Chris & I watched Troy last night and let me just fill you in on something very special: there are 2 or 3 nude shots of Brad Pitt in this movie!!  Not full frontal nudity, but close enough to fill your dreams with men sweating and wearing teeny tiny leather skirts.  Yummy!!  It was a great movie & I have quite a few favorite parts, so get out there and see it!  P.S. Eric Bana & Orlando Bloom are fantasticaly yummy, too!  In sad news,  urlLink Becca's (becca.ooo-caliente.com)  cockateil died.  My condolences, Becca.  In the spirit of all that is bloginess, I stole this from  urlLink Cindi Rella !  It's a  urlLink fun golf game  you can play anywhere as long as you have a computer and a line to the internet.  Enjoy my little ones!  Today I'm going to get my hair cut and my highlights touched up.  I'll feel like a new woman when I'm done.  When I get home, I'll have to start the cleaning process since my sister, Bridget, will be here tomorrow afternoon!!  Since they changed her interview time, she comes in a day earlier and now we have 2 days/evening together to hang out.  I'll show as much as I can without overwhelming her.  I can't wait!  And then, my little sister, Becca, and her boyfriend, Trevor, will be here in like 2 weeks!!  They're staying for a whole week and while I'll have to work every day they're here, but they'll have plenty to keep them busy until I get off work.  OK, off to wake Chris up and then get ready to go into the city - cause I'm in Queens right now.  By the way, I'm working on changing the layout since Blogger is now offering many more interesting templates.  However, I've lost all of my comments.  Sorry.  Don't know if I'll get the ones back from Haloscan or not.  Leave a comment or email me if there is something missing that you'd like added back.

      Have you ever picked up a piece of clothing that you own that you haven't worn for while and you sit and wonder why you haven't worn it in so long? Well, that happened to me today. I was getting ready for work and picked out a black cap sleeved shirt that has a kind of mock wrap around neckline. It's black with red, pink and white flowers that ties in the back. So I decide to wear my little shirt to work and when I get there, it finally dawns on me why I don't wear the shirt to work anymore as I look down and see my right breast about to pop out of my shirt. Note to self: quit wearing the boob shirt to work!

      I don't know why, but I watched the video of the beheading of Nick Berg.  For one, I didn't think they would actually show the whole thing, but I was wrong.  I won't link to it but I will say that it's one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.  If you want to see it bad enough, then you, being the resourceful person that you are, will find it.  The sad part is that this was retaliation for the Iraqi prisoner abuse.  I could go into a whole rant about how wrong the abuse was and how these soldiers' superiors ordered them to pose and what not and how I feel about it.  I'm not jumping on that soapbox today.  I'm too disturbed by the video.  At the end of the video, they hold up his head in front of the camera just before it goes off.  Very disturbing.  Before I move onto lighter topics, let me first point out that I've been wondering if the media wouldn't highlight all of the bad things happening in the world, would we be happier people?  Would the ignorance of not knowing be worthwhile?  Would it give us a better quality of life?  I guess not.  Perhaps that was silly of me to think so.  Just because the media doesn't showcase something doesn't mean that it's not taking place.  So moving on to lighter, brighter things, can I just say that Brad Pitt is positively yummy?!?  With all of the hype for his next movie, Troy, coming out this Friday, there are pictures of him plastered all over this city.  And after about 2 years of absence, I say it's about time.  That's what my life has been missing: Brad Pitt all ripped up wearing a teeny tiny leather skirt.  I can now die a happy girl!  An update to what happened to my friend's son yesterday.  She got home and checked him out.  His neck hurt where one of the boys punched him and he had a headache that evening.  Turns out that there were 5 boys who tried to jump him and they all go to a charter school in the area where she lives.  Luckily, these boys were wearing their school uniforms and bandanas around their heads which made them easily to identify.  My friend went to their school this morning and spoke with the principal who offered to let her and her son come in after school and try to identify the boys by looking through the yearbook.  She plans on taking up her offer and once she identifies them, the school is going to contact their parents to make them aware.  She also made a report to the police but hasn't pressed charges.  She put it on record in the event they should try to pull something similar or worse and she'll call the police back with the boys' names once she has them.  I think she's probably done the smartest thing I could think of in this situation.  I would have never have thought to call the police or try to track these boys down by what uniforms they had on.  Note to future self.  I just got a call from my oldest sister, Bridget!  She is coming to NYC next week for an interview.  Unfortunately, she'll only be here overnight so I'm going to go spend the night with her in her hotel room.  I'm so excited that I get to see her, but sad it'll only be for 1 night.  Oh well, beggars can't be choosers, right?  I'll gladly take what I can get.  I'm going to try my hardest to show her as much as I can while she's here.  Today's Memes:   Top 10 Things That Make Me Happy   10. Sleeping in on Saturday mornings - and it's twice as nice when Berg doesn't scratch everything in his reach just to wake me up.  9. The Internet.  I can find anything my little heart desires in the blink of an eye.  8. My coffee maker.  It's programmable so all I have to do in the mornings is pour myself a cup.  7. DVDs/DVD player.  Our collection grows by leaps & bounds so it's nice to have all of this at my fingertips.  6. The smell of fresh cut grass.  I have no idea why, but I love it!  5. Berg and all his evilness!  4. A beautiful summer day.  And a sundress to go with it!  3. Beer & other vices (in general) as they are what makes an ordinary day all that more interesting.  2. My family & friends.  They're always there for me no matter how rotten I feel about myself.  1. My husband.  He can read me (most of the time) even when I'm trying not to show my true feelings and he can make me laugh at the drop of a hat.

      It's such a beautiful day!!  And about damn time, too, considering it's May 11th!  Blogger has a new look and I think I like it.  Not so much happening in my world today.  Amanda came over last night and we started a lively game of Monopoly at about 9 pm that lasted for about 2 1/2 hours.  Amanda was kicking my ass & Chris's too!  She owned both utilities and all 4 railroads.  Chris was the first to erect a hotel and he would have bought more if it hadn't been so late.  I think I came out on the short end of the stick with fewer properties, but I did have Boardwalk and Park Avenue in my pocket!!  I've read so much these past few days about the Iraqi prison abuse and then I hopped over to  urlLink DaGoddess's  site.  I think she puts into words what I cannot, so please go and read.  It's a great post and if there's anything I could gank from her site today, it would be:  urlLink Apologies Do Not Weaken Us & Let's Move Forward .  And there's only one more thing I'd like to cover before I sign off today.  My friend (and co-worker) got a call from her oldest son, who is about 12 years old.  He was upset and crying.  She calmed him down and asked him what was wrong.  Turns out that some kids tried to jump him when he got off the bus at his block.  (The bus drops him off 1 block from his house)  This group of kids called out to him and he tried ignoring them.  Then one kid came at him and punched him in the neck.  Another kid was about to hit him when he took off running.  He ran home and called his mom.  She was upset - who wouldn't be - and left work early.  Her son did the right thing by getting out of the situation quick, but that leaves you to wonder what will happen tomorrow and the next day when he gets off the bus.  What about the day after that?  It's not like she can be there every day when the bus drops him off nor should she have to baby him.  After all, kids get into fights.  It's simply a part of growing up.  But when you and your kids live in Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, the Bronx, New Jersey, etc, you realize that things aren't like they were when you were growing up in a small town in the middle of BFE where people would actually stop and help someone in need.  Here, in this metropolis we call New York, people aren't as nice.  When someone is in need of help, most people here just walk on by and pretend they didn't see or hear a thing.  No one wants to be held responsible or worse yet, liable for something that might go wrong.  That's one of the scariest things about what happened to my friend's kid today.  If this group of kids really had tried to hurt her son, would anyone have stopped to help?  I'd like to think so, but I somehow doubt it.

      I found myself with time on my hands today so I was trying to think of some interesting topics for my post.  I've visited my usual news websites and found there's a lack of interesting things to post about that haven't already been beaten 12 feet into the ground.    So instead, I thought I would tell you what little I know about my stalker.  Let me first say that I don't for sure if he's stalking me, per say, but for all intents & purposes, he'll be my stalker today.  Nearly every morning when I leave for work, I get halfway down the block and I look up to find this guy standing on the corner.  He's always just waiting there.  Once he sees me, he starts walking very slowly to the subway.  Maybe I'm just a tool he uses to time the train, I don't really know.  Anyway, I see him & he starts walking to the train.  I pass him by and he doesn't say anything to me and he doesn't speed up his walking.  As a matter of fact, that's really about it except when it rains.  For some reason, he walks a little too close for comfort when I'm carrying my umbrella.  When it rains & I find him walking too close, it takes every little bit of self-restraint I have not to beat him down with my red Mandarin Oriental umbrella and then hop onto the train.  I don't necessarily feel threatened by my stalker, I'm just curious.  Why me and why does he just wait on the corner until he sees me coming.  Oh well, life's mysteries, I guess.  Needless to say, every time I see him, I'm left daydreaming about what exactly I would do to him if he should ever try to grab me.  And let me tell you, I'd sure make a hell of a racket & I'd go down kicking and screaming and biting and cussing to boot!  Well, that's enough stalker talk.  Today's Memes courtesy of  urlLink Monday Madness :  1. If you had a farm, what would you name the following animals:  pig, cow, goose, chicken, and horse (assume these are show animals and not food.)   pig : The Great Flying Bacon goose : The Mystical Magical Goose chicken : Wise Cock horse : The Stallion  2. What are the top ten spices you use in cooking and what is cooked with them as the main spice (ie. Oregano : spaghetti)   how about I just list the top 10 spices that I use to cook, huh?  Ok, they are: salt, pepper, Tony's Chachere Seasoning, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Salt, Lowry's Seasoning Salt, Garlic - ok, that's only 8, but I'm done.  3. Name your favorite flower and describe yourself using the letter.  This week, my favorite flower is the peony.

      It's such a beautiful day here in NYC!!  And about damn time, too!  Last night when we went to the movies, I finally got to wear my favorite sundress with a hoodie, of course.  I was so comfortable and it was so nice out that it almost felt magical.  Ah, summer!!  Yesterday at work, I came across this story on  urlLink Slate  about this woman who did an experimental silent treatment for just a couple of days and she tells about how hard it was to do it.  I thought it was pretty funny and it's a fast read, so check it out  urlLink here .  And now for your Saturday Links:   urlLink Can you catch a fly with chopsticks ?  It's kind of hard, but I caught at least one before I moved on, so here go -  urlLink your turn !  Why carry around some plain, boring black umbrella when you can carry around a  urlLink Bright Night Illuminated Umbrella ?!  According the article, it comes with 2 bulbs that actually do a great job of lighting up everything underneath the canopy, which you have the option of controlling with a button on the handle.  It has a battery compartment for 4 AA batteries that will give you 4 hours of lighting.  Cool colors, nice handle, great construction, & a light - would else could you possibly ask for?  OK, I know that's only 2 links, but I'll have to come back later.  It's such a nice day out that I can't just sit here in front of the computer anymore.  See ya later!

      Chris & I saw Van Helsing, after drinks & some appetizers.  I liked it for the special effects, but don’t expect great things from it.  The story line is a little weak.  I think the most awesome part was when these guys would turn into werewolves.  They would rip off their skin and their bones would start moving and shifting - it was really cool!  I also liked the vampire brides and how they would immediately change into these gorgeous women as soon as they touched the ground.  I'd recommend going to see it, but again, don't expect great things.   I haven’t bought my Mom a Mother’s Day gift yet but her birthday is the 17th, so I’m planning to send something halfway between for both events.  I know that’s kind of lame and lazy but that’s how things get done around my house.  Lame & Lazy.  If I had a ranch, I’d have to call it L & L Dude Rand and stock it with hot guys who walk around bare-chested all day long while they lift heavy things so that they sweat & then they’ll need me to rub their shoulders after their doneeeeee – sorry, I was drooling on my keyboard.  I’m going to have to come back to this subject after work!  My thoughts keep getting away from me and then I wake up only to have my coworkers staring at me strangely too afraid to ask questions.  Well, Chris is graduating from his Level 1 improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade.  His show is this Sunday at 4 pm.  I can’t wait to see my baby perform!!  I’m thinking about making a t-shirt with a picture of him on it and that says something stupid (read: embarrassing), but I’m going to have to think hard on this.  I may have to tap my sister, Bridget, for some ideas.  She’s a clever lass.   And for today’s random question:  What bones have you broken, if any?  And how did you break it?   Well, during the summer before 3rd grade, I was playing basketball on a concrete slab (that used to be our house before it burned) with 3 others.  I tripped and fell on my right arm.  It didn’t hurt until everyone started pointing at it & then it hurt like hell.  Long story short, I ended up in a full arm cast on my right arm.    A week after I finally got the cast off, I went over to my friend’s house to play.  We were climbing trees, doing cartwheels, running all over the place, etc.  Unfortunately, I tripped (again!) on my way into her playhouse & broke the same arm in the same place.  Luckily, since my Mom was still in the driveway talking to her Mom, she ushered me into the car wrapped my arm in ice and then we were on our way to Shreveport to get my arm set again.  And finally, in the 6th grade, I fractured my left arm during gym at school.  It was the first class of the day & we were playing dodgeball when, again, I tripped.  I made it through the day only to go home and beg my Dad to take me to the hospital cause it hurt so badly.  So there, that’s my 3 broken bones.  I won’t even get into the story of the 3 stitches I had in my head due to (once again) dodgeball.  Thought I was gonna say that I tripped again, didn’t ya?

      I found this little website, on  urlLink DaGoddess’s  website;  urlLink creative & funny story about moving to New York City through the eyes of a monkey .  I have a feeling our little friend, Pepe, will have similar experiences when he accompanies us to Italy, so be on the lookout for The Adventures of Pepe Vol. 1: Italy coming in August to a blog near you!  Neat website where people can  urlLink submit 5 things others don’t know about them .  Since I haven’t debuted there yet, here are some (not just 5) of mine:   Things I’m not afraid to admit, but probably should be:   I get to work an hour early so I’m not in bad mood due to overcrowded trains.  I’m usually pretty good about not eating sweets until right before my period at which point I will sit on the kitchen floor and eat left over chocolate icing right out of the can using my finger.  I still like to send handwritten letters to my family.  If I could, I would live in South Louisiana and I would be the happiest person in all the world.  My cat, Berg, thinks I’m his mistress and tries to make a move on me from time to time.  I have a heater underneath my desk that is always on as long as I’m at work.  And if I’m really cold, I also use my heating pad which can also be found under my desk.  In nearly 3 years, I’ve only been to one small part of Central Park several times.  I’ve only been to 1 major league baseball game – the Mets & they lost.  The very first concert I went to was either Bad Company when they came to NSU in Natchitoches or Clint Black in Shreveport.  I used to watch professional wrestling religiously.  I ordered the pay-per-views every month, but I have since stopped watching.  Part of me is disappointed and the other part is relieved.     And now, get ready for the Thursday Threesome :   Onesome : Something Old – Do you have anything that you’ve owned simply forever A cherished childhood toy, an antique handed down through the family . . . I have a wooden coffee table and an old metal kitchen table that was my (great)Grandmother’s.  They have traveled with me everywhere!   Twosome : Something New – Buy anything lately?  I bought lunch today, does that count?  Otherwise, the last thing I purchased that wasn’t food was a baby shower gift for someone I work with: diapers, wipes, baby spoons, medicine dropper, pacifiers, gas drops.   Threesome : Something Borrowed – Ever borrowed anything and never returned it?  I hate to admit it, but yes.  Some old tapes of ECW (wrestling) that someone loaned when I moved to NYC.   Bonus : Something Blue – See anything blue from where you are? What is it?  My shirt is blue, but other than that, my mousepad is also blue and the label on my water bottle and the cover of my notebook, the highlighter in my penholder, the top to my lotion bottle . . .   Play along!  When you’re ready, post your answer in your own space and  urlLink leave a comment here  so we can find you.

      I went to the Social Security Office yesterday expecting the worst.  How wrong I was!  And how happy I am to be wrong!  I'll have my new card in about 2 weeks.  Awesome!  There were no arguments on changing my name, no diagrams drawn, no accusations thrown in my direction.  Fabulous!  Two down, one to go.  Next comes passports.  Last night was the season finale for The OC.  I began watching The OC from the very first episode because there was absolutely nothing on TV on Tuesday nights since Buffy went off the air.  Yes, that's right, I was/am a Buffy fan.  I'm not a fanatic like some people I know, but a fan nonetheless.  I'm a little sad that The OC will now be reruns until Fall, but that's how the system works.  Tonight is the 2-hour season/series finale for Friends.  I'm sure I'll bawl my eyes out tonight.  I've already warned Chris and he's prepared to hand me tissues at will.  He's loves me so!  I am, of course, a little sad Friends is ending but it's been like 9 or 10 years and I think it's time.  I guess you can't keep the same gig forever.  So Monday evening, my (not-so-little) sister, Becca, went to my parents house looking for one of her rings.  No one was home at the time, so she looked around, used the bathroom & left.  Well, somehow, the toilet kept running and kept running and overflowed and ruined the carpet in my parent's bedroom, Becca's old bedroom and the hallway carpet.  Mom discovered this about 3 hours after Becca left the house.  They had to remove all of the furniture in both bedrooms, call the carpet people to come clean up as much water as possible, and then the insurance adjuster.  Once, they get everything squared away, they'll be laying down hardwood flooring throughout the house.  Unfortunately, it looks like they'll be spending Mother's Day weekend prepping the house by painting, etc.  Oh!  And it would seem when they pulled up the carpet, they found the ugliest brown tile flooring.  They had to remove that as well.  I feel so bad for them because they hadn't planned on doing all of this work just yet, but they were planning on redoing the flooring at some point.  Perhaps this will jump start the remodeling of their house.  I wish I were there helping them out.  I love that sort of thing.  Well, I need to go blow dry my hair & get ready for work.  I don't wake up looking stunning, you know.  My tiara is usually crooked in the mornings when I wake up.  Time to go fix that.

      I am now official.  I have a New York State driver's license - or a temporary license, anyway.  I'll get the new one in the mail in the next 3 or 4 weeks.  It was not without conflict, which was to be expected.  I got up to the first counter & everything was OK.  I took my picture, she gave me my number and papers & told me to go sit until my number flashed on the board.  I did as I was told and my number was finally on the board.  So it was up to counter #9, I handed him my paperwork and waited.  First, he didn't want to accept my marriage certificate because he didn't think it was the official one from the state.  I argued my case and he finally asked his manager who said she would accept my certificate.  Yee haw!!  Then of course, he argued with me on how I'd decided to change my name.  Technically, when you get married and you're changing to your married name, you should simply switch out the 2 last names.  However, my Mom & my sister both did it differently.  (First Name, Maiden Name, Married Name)  I choose to do it differently as well.  This obviously angered the little man behind the counter who proceeded to argue his point which included 2 different drawings so that he could stress his point even further.  He went so far as to tell me that I was in the 10% who was in the wrong & I was setting a bad example for my future (nonexistent) children.  I stand there trying to keep my cool, everything going slightly red.  Obviously, I could have decided to change my name to Lulu Tutu if I felt like it & there really isn't anything anyone could do about it.  I don't know why this guy felt so compelled to argue with me, but he let me change my name how I wanted.  I was proud that I kept my cool - only because I was afraid he'd throw me out and make me come back another day.  This was my 3rd attempt after all.  So today, I'm off to the Social Security Office here in Queens.  I'll let you know how that turns out.  I'm actually quite afraid that it's going to turn into one huge disaster, but we'll have to wait and see.  I guess I'm up for making multiple trips to the Social Security Office if I have to.  I did for the DMV.  After getting my new social security card, I will attempt to get a passport.  I've got fun written all over me the next few weeks.  All of this so we can go on our trip to Italy at the end of July.  Now I have to go get ready to go.  It's May 5th - Cinco de Mayo!  Unfortunately, it's only 49 degrees outside and the high for today is only 61.  Come on summer!!

      Some Mondays are just fine & dandy - no big deal.  Today, I thought my head would explode.  First, I went down the DMV (that says it all right there, doesn't it?) to get my Louisiana license changed to a NY State license & also to change my maiden name to my married name.  Yes, nearly 2 years after the fact.  You don't have to remind me.  It's not like I haven't tried to do this before, but they didn't accept my marriage certificate last time because it wasn't  the certified copy.  Anyway, so after asking my sisters to go by the courthouse & picking up the correct copy, I sat on it for about a year.  So that brings us back to today. I'm in line at 8 am.  The office opens at 8:30 & the line is halfway around the corner & down the block.  Once I finally make it to the window, they tell me they need my birth certificate which I have conveniently left at home.  I silently collect my papers, etc. and head to work.    Once I hit work, I'm told that the 22 books we sent out on Friday (and that I stayed an hour & a half late to complete) had to be redone since there weren't any page numbers and there was 1 spelling error.  I just bit my tongue, hole-punched the 22 books, spiral bound them, boxed them up and sent them out.  Silently cursing everyone.

      I had somewhat of a strange day today.  At 1 pm I went to a baby shower that was on my street, but 4 1/2 blocks down.  I work with the mother-to-be.  So I go to their apartment (which is huge!) & there are family members there from both sides.  And they were all great!  Very nice, but I couldn't help but compare this shower to the baby showers that I'm used to going to back home.  Let me start by saying I have a HUGE family on both sides of my family.  My Mom's family all live within about an hour's drive, but most are about 20 minutes away.  When we get together, it's 90% family & there are like 30+ people there with kids running everywhere.  And you get EVERYTHING!  This was the group that we mainly did this sort of activity with since they were all so close.  I think in today's experience, I was that other 10% in the "friends" category that goes to showers.  There were about 20 people there including me.  Actually, I think I was the only one there who wasn't family, but it didn't take me long to strike up a conversation with Pam.  Pam's mother was married to the mother-to-be's grandfather.  After much thought, I finally figured out all of the connections.  Anyway, Pam is married and lives in Greenwich Village.  She is an artist & photographer.  Her husband is a writer, I think, at Sports Illustrated - which just happens to be across the street from where I work.  His office is on the 2nd floor above one of the letters.  Anyway, she was telling me how they just went to Greece so that he could do a story on the upcoming Olympics.  She went with him and took like 1000 photos.  However, they just got back from New Zealand just a few days prior (to the shower).  She couldn't stress enough how great New Zealand was to visit.  Little does she know that she doesn't have to convince me too hard since Chris & I are dying to go to New Zealand on our next trip.  During her trip, they went bungee jumping.  She's in her mid-40s and she doesn't look like the adventurous type, which gives me hope that I won't chicken out of bungee jumping one day when I get my opportunity.  After leaving the shower around 4:30 pm, going home & changing clothes and going to the grocery story, I did laundry.  Such a tiring chore.  I'm glad it's over.  Until next week that is.  Oh!  Back home at the grocery stores, I don't remember ever seeing packages of chicken feet or cow tongues among other strange items I find up here.  Odd thing is, I can't even find blocks of Velveeta Cheese at this store.  They have most of the basics, but I also have a hard time finding Lemon Pepper seasoning there as well.  Ok, enough of that.  So Chris & I are trying to learn some Italian before our trip at the end of June.  I have some words down, like: thank you(grazie), you're welcome (prego), excuse me as in sorry (scuzi) - and I think that's it.  It's a start, but I really need to buckle down and work on it.  I'd like to be able to understand certain words so that our trip will be even more AWESOME!  Ok, so I guess I'm going to go learn some Italian now.

      On the subject of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by 6 US troops, may I just say that it's appalling?  I'm somewhat outraged by this.  We wouldn't want US citizens in prison elsewhere in the world to be treated in this manner.  They did it for shits & giggles and I hope they get what they deserve.  They now say that the soldiers who did this didn't know the Geneva Convention rules.  Seems like someone should have filled them in considering they were responsible for Iraqi prisoners of war in a war zone.   urlLink But moving on to other things, I read this story about a woman who drove around with her mother's decomposing body in the passenger seat of her for like 5 days.  They were from Oklahoma and they finally stopped the daughter in Florida.  Authorities say she died from natural causes so no charges will be filed, however, the daughter is now being held for psychiatric evaluation.   WEED MARCH - Yesterday, I read the following in the AM-NY newspaper.  I didn't even know such a thing exists & I'm surprised they can do this but since they're simply meeting and not smoking, it's OK.  You would never hear of something like this in the small town where I grew up - only in NYC.  Anyway, the article goes:   Million Marijuana March set for Sat.  - Potheads from all around town are expected to converge on Lower Manhattan tomorrow for the New York City Million Marijuana March.   Organized by a coalition of marijuana legalization advocates, protesters will march from Greenwich Village to Battery Park.  A variety of issues will be raised, from the Rockefeller drugs laws to medicinal marijuana.  The weed walkers will assemble at noon at Houston Street and Broadway and start marching at 1 p.m.  Police said they will treat tomorrow's march like every other large gathering.  May Day marijuana rallies were first started by the radical Yippies during the 1970s but fell out of favor in subsequent years.

      Not much time to post today since Chris-the-Great & I are about to go watch Spider Man 2!!  I wasn't a big fan of the first movie, but I hear this one is much better, so I hope they're right!  I just wanted to do a little promoting:   urlLink Operation Shoe Fly  is an organization "formed in an effort to help with the collection, consolidation, and delivery of humanitarian aid for the Afghani people."  (Yep, I stole that right off their website.)  They're not only asking for shoes, but for other objects to send to Afghanistan, so please check it out and help if you can.  There are 3 options:  Option 1: Mail directly to Operation Shoe Fly-  Operation Shoe Fly c/o Jim Thomson B Co, 214th Aviation Regiment APO AE 09354  Option 2: Mail to Angels for Afghanistan who will ship pallets to the Stan-  Globous Relief Fund (OPSF) c/o Angels for Afghanistan 1775 West 1500 South Salt Lake City, Utah 84104  Option 3: Mail to Chief Wiggles who will add to his shipments to the Stan-  Bridgepoint Systems (OPSF) c/o Operation Give 542 West Confluence Avenue Salt Lake City, Utah 84123  Alright, must go get ready for Spidey, but before I go,  urlLink click here  for the next installment of: What the F*ck Where They Thinking?!?

      Brad & Beth are now safely back on Louisiana soil and I'm sure Brad is driving his truck doing some "country riding."  Don't ask.  Anyway, we had a great time with them!  I'll be posting some pictures in the Gallery 6 link on the right in a couple of days.  As of this post, I only have 3 up.  I hope they come back for another visit so we can do everything we missed.  In other news, I've started reading The Da Vinci Code.  I'm only on Chapter 4, but it's good so far.  Also, the Discovery Channel was filming an episode  urlLink Surprise By Design  in a building across the street & down from our apt.  I must go wake Chris-the-Great from his nap & heat up some leftover spaghetti for dinner.  I don't think I need to cook at all this week since I have leftovers spilling forth every time I open the refrigerator door.

      I am so exhausted!  It's been a busy week for me and I'm glad we can sleep in tomorrow.  Well, actually, Chris-the-Great has to get up early (8:45 am) for a class rehearsal.  Brad, Beth & I are going to the Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero, the Merril Lynch bull near Wall Street.  From there, we'll just play it by ear as they say.  We have to go back down to Chinatown at some point and we also still would like to go to the Empire State Building before sunset.  We've had a good time so far, but my poor knee hurts.  After walking Chinatown, SoHo up the to East Village (4th Street around Astor Place).  Oh!  And we also went to see Dodgeball with Ben Stiller & Vince Vaughn.  Absolutely hilarious!!  It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time - like consistently through nearly the entire movie!  I don't know if it's just because we used to play dodgeball in school & it could be quite vicious sometimes.  I think I've already posted about how I received 3 stitches & broke my arm in my dodgeball days.  I'd look for it, but I'm feeling pretty lazy tonight, uh, I mean this morning.  Anyway, hilarious movie!  Go see it, you won't be disappointed.  I've really got to get to bed now.  My eyes are starting to close.  Tomorrow, the adventure continues.

      Well Brad & Beth made it here just fine & since they've arrived, we had lunch at Uno Pizzeria here in Astoria & then we walked around a small part of Central Park until Chris got off work.  We also walked around some of the shoppes at the new Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.  We're home for now.  Chris has class tonight and I think I'm going to take them to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral tonight.  Chris will get out of class at 10 pm and I don't know if they're up for going out later.  I'll probably be too tired to go.  I have the hardest time staying up late during the week.  So far, I think it's a lot busier than they thought it would be and maybe a little cleaner, too.  Chris & Brad are up on the roof and Beth is catching a quick nap while I blog my little heart out.  I just posted a picture of Radio City Music Hall from the night of the PRIMUS concert.  Enjoy.  If you look close enough, you'll see the name of the tour on the marquee.  Gotta go entertain.

       urlLink Primus  was awesome!   urlLink The Hallucino Genetics Tour !  It started at exactly 8 pm and ended at 10:57 pm.  They said something about having to be out of the building at 11 pm.  There was no pig, but the drum solo knocked my knockers off!  The concert was at Radio City Music Hall & I had never been there before.  It was like stepping back into the 30's with all of the grandeur of gentlemen & ladies - the building, not the crowd of concertgoers.  The bathrooms alone were divine!  The seats were velvet with carpet everywhere - in the seating area, not the bathrooms.  There were ushers everywhere and I even got patted down as we entered Radio City.  And even though they announced before the concert that there was no smoking, that didn't stop people from lighting up.  And we're not talking cigarettes here.  The ushers didn't stop anyone & no trouble, of course.  Most potheads are fairly harmless especially when there's live music 75 feet in front of you from the most awesome band in the world.  Unfortunately, getting myself going this morning proved to be difficult.  After I got up and got my shower & Chris-the-Great was out the door, I took an hour nap.  I don't think it did much good.  My eyes wouldn't even open until Noon today.  I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep standing up.  Still worth it.  Brad & Beth are coming tomorrow!  Chris-the-Great has class tomorrow night, but I'm sure we'll find something to do while he's gone.  I of course still need to finish cleaning the apt.  I'll probably finish up tomorrow morning.  On the other hand, I'm taking the bus to the airport tomorrow.  I haven't done that in a while and I'm kind of looking forward to it.  Buses really arent' my thing.  I just can't seem to get the bus schedules down so I never take them unless I absolutely have to.  I don't mind walking.  Ok, off to go clean something.  But before I go, I checked out  urlLink Lisa  at  urlLink Just A Girl In The World  and found it to be worthy of the link button.  Go check her out!  Now!  And while I'm plugging, go also check out  urlLink Becca !  Shoo!  Now go!

      Another Monday off to a fine start.  I could have killed Chris-the-not-so-Great this morning.  Sergio came downstairs last night & cut his hair around 11:30 or midnight.  Chris took a shower afterward, but didn't bother writing me a note or resetting his alarm clock.  I've been awake since about 4:50 am - in 10 minute intervals.  He didn't tell me until nearly 5:30 am that he had already taken his shower so he could sleep for a while.  All that time - wasted - not sleeping.  But the upside to all of this is: I'm going to see PRIMUS tomorrow!!  Yeah, that's right bitches!  So don't expect a post tomorrow, I'll be partying away!  This week will be busy: Brad & his friend, Beth are coming for a visit on Thursday.  I don't know Beth but I guess I'll have time to get to know her.  Then, in late August, my sister Catherine & her husband, John, are coming up for her birthday!  I just found out today so I'm way excited!  But, let's not forget Italy.  I mean, it's only the first real vacation Chris & I have ever taken together in the 9+ years we've known each other.  Oh, and our first trip overseas ever - for both of us.  Yeah!!  The only thing we have left to do is get our passports.  If for some reason our waiting this long to get our passports screws up our trip, I'm going to flip my lid!  I've got to think positively.  Think positively . . .  In today's news: In pursuit of the $10 million X-prize, the first privately built aircraft made it 62.5 miles upward into space, briefly. It then returned to where it took off just a short time afterward. This is the first step in competing for the prize; the contest will happen later this year. ( urlLink CNN.com )  From News of the Weird: From a police report quoted in Seattle's newsweekly The Stranger (April 29): "[A] witness stated that he and another witness watched the suspect walk up to several different men [at the University Book Store on the University of Washington campus], get on his knees, and sniff their anuses. He would then lean forward as though he was getting a book off the lower shelf. [One witness] also said that when one male got up from a bench and walked away, the suspect walked over and started smelling the area where the male had been sitting. When the witnesses confronted the suspect about the incidents, the suspect said, 'Sometimes I forget myself and get carried away.'"  I'm hearing so much about that fat f*ck Michael Moore - that hypocritical piece of sh*t.  Anyway, his movie is coming out this weekend or next and there's a lot of hype about it and I'm trying to decide if I'm going to go see it.  I mean, on the one hand, I don't like the man.  He's a big hypocrite.  On the other hand, I'm curious to see what kind of lies this man has on tape.  I'm also curious to see what kind of footage this guy has from the Middle East.  For instance, as we all know by now, he had footage from one of the hostages but didn't want to release it since he thought it would generate negative publicity for his movie.  That selfish piece of sh*t.  Alright, so I'm going to see the movie but I won't be happy about paying for it.  I hate thinking he's actually making money off of this.  Why do I hate this man so much?  Oh, yeah, he's a big fat hypocritical piece of sh*t, that's why.  I need to go have a beer and calm down.  That fat f*ck.

      I love Fridays because it's the start of the weekend, which means I can sleep in tomorrow!!  Yeah!  Chris & I went over to Cindy's apt. earlier to set up her new computer.  It was shipped to our apt. so we had to bring it over.  Damn that thing was heavy.  The monitor came double boxed, so we had to leave the smaller box at our apt. so we could fit it all in the cab.  She should get hooked up to the internet next week & then the fun will begin for her.  We just watched Duplex on Movies-on-Demand tonight.  Ben Stiller.  Drew Barrymore.  It was kind of funny at times but the ending kind of sucked.  Killed what little the movie offered.  Here's a  urlLink link to a mysterious little clip .  It takes a while to load & I don't have any information on it really.  It's obviously a shootout in what appears to be somewhere in the Middle East.  Scary when you stop and think about it.   urlLink This should be illegal  - I mean, there should be a limit on the breast implant size based on your body type/frame and just plain common sense.  Next up is a collection of  urlLink strange band names .  OK, last one for the night:  urlLink Which Muppet Are You ?   urlLink I am Gonzo .

      I should have just stayed in bed this morning.  First, I have a hard time getting Chris up, thus he stalked off to the shower in quite the mood. Then, I couldn't get the mouse to work on the desktop computer this morning so I could check the weather. After 2 attempts, I used the laptop. Later, my train was held up at the last stop in Queens before going into the City due to a stalled train at the next station. I transferred to the 7 train and walked from Times Square to Rockefeller Center. It wasn't a bad walk, just 10 blocks. The thing that set me off was having to walk on sidewalks that had just been washed. Doesn't sound bad, does it? Well, I was wearing flip flops and the back of my pink skirt had little black dots all over it. Unfortunately, I didn't notice it until after I'd waited in line at the bank's ATM for 15 minutes trying to make a deposit. Luckily, that part went right - so far anyway. So I finally rolled into work 40 minutes after my normal time. Unfortunately, I couldn't do anything about my skirt. To top that off, what's waiting for me when I get home: dishes & laundry. I should have just stayed in bed.  I called my little sister earlier to rub in the fact that: I'M GOING TO SEE PRIMUS! Amanda and I are going this Tuesday night.  Something I find strange: you know those plush dolls from Hallmark that dance and sing when you push a button? I seriously can't stand those things! I go to Hallmark today and find one of my coworkers pressing all the buttons and laughing up a storm. It took all that I had to not drag her away from the table and give her a good kick. Those things are just so annoying, so PLEASE, don't anyone ever buy me one of those things! I'll probably just burn it.

      It's been another lovely day in the neighborhood, so far anyway. Today at lunch, I went to a Japanese bookstore/gift shop in Rockefeller Center with a friend. She's half Japanese & her American father teaches Japanese at a school in Florida. So for Father's Day - which is this Sunday - she got him a few things for his desk at the school. The store was really cool, but I didn't know what half the stuff was since neither of us speak Japanese nor read it for that matter. If we couldn't figure out what it was by looking at it and turning it over and over in our hands, then back on the shelf it went!  Chris the Great checked in Jessica Simpson & her sister, Ashley, today at work. He said that Jessica is a stuck-up snob but everyone else was really nice. Which brings me to my next announcement: The season premiere of SIMPLE LIFE 2 will air tonight on FOX at 8 pm EST. I must admit that I watched it last season simply to see how they fared in the middle of nowhere, but I'm afraid this season will be too commercialized after the success of last season. I guess I'll have to wait & see!  In other TV show news, Chris & I have been watching HBO's Deadwood. The first season just ended and it was way better than I thought it would be. I'm afraid I'm hooked and now I'm upset that I have to wait until this fall to see a new episode. But have no fear - I will not have to go that long before seeing a (repeat) episode. We subscribed to HBO & Cinemax-on-Demand and we can now watch any show on those stations that has already run this season. I can go back and watch all episodes of Deadwood back-to-back if I feel like it or I can watch soft porn until my heart's content, which is what we did last night!  Our company's Summer Outing is coming up the 2nd Monday in August. Every year, they rent out the country club & people have the following options: golf, tennis, swimming, softball, volleyball, or just laying out by the pool. And then there's the open bar for the entire day! Here's a general rundown of how the day goes:       catch the bus from the office at 10 am     get to the club around 11:30 am     eat brunch & drink mimosas     activity (or inactivity) of your choice     freshen up at around 5 pm     cocktail hour at 5:30 pm     dinner is served around 6 or 6:30 pm     catch the bus back to the city around 7:30 pm  All in all, I think it's a lot of fun. Unfortunately, last year it rained most of the day & people were kind of stuck inside. This year, the Summer Outing will be my first day back in the office after our trip to Italy. Nothing like a nice day of lounging around and drinking to get you back in the grind.

      I went to see  urlLink The Boy From Oz  last night and it was by far one of the most fantastic things I've ever seen!  It was my first Broadway Show and I hope it won't be my last.  Hugh Jackman starred in the show & he was so witty & energetic that it blew my mind.  And he got undressed/dressed on stage a couple of times, which is always nice!  Not much else to report.  I'm exhausted so I can hopefully veg-out tonight and get to bed a little early.  There's a lot of talk about who John Kerry will choose for his VP.  I think  urlLink Blackjack  breaks it down best, so go take a look at his post.  Since I won't be voting for Kerry, I don't care that much who he chooses.  It will be interesting when the debates start later this year, so Kerry will have to pick someone who can debate Dick Cheney.  It should be another interesting election year!  Well, I guess I should go get ready for work.  Time to go pay the piper.

      Well, the desktop is finally up and running.  Turns out that we had to disconnect the hard drive we installed a few months ago and rerun the recovery disks.  Alls well that ends well as they say.  I was perusing  urlLink Natalie 's post over on  urlLink Pickle Juice: Raged and Obuse  where she talks about her amazing ability to flirt.  Oddly enough, this reminds me of a dream I had the other night where Chris was sitting on the living room floor with the girl and he was flirting right in front of me.  He then leaned in and gave her a kiss, pulled back, and then went for a 2nd kiss.  Boy was I mad when I woke up!  And when he woke up, I let him know I didn't appreciate his cheating on me right in front of me.  Very strange dream.  Very.  OK, time to trade computers with Chris.

      This is my first post from my new laptop computer.  It's a nice little Toshiba Satellite and I like it!  We're bringing this laptop to Italy so that we can download our pictures from our digital camera so we can take even more pictures of Italy.  When Becca & Trevor were here, we took 750 pictures and each one was 6.2 megapixels which equals a lot of memory.  Ta da!  Laptop.  At the same time, we're trying to fix the desktop which was running slow.  We decided to simply start over from scratch.  It unfortunately didn't work so smoothly but the lady on HP's technical support line said that I need to disconnect everything except the monitor, mouse & keyboard and try again.  After that, they'll charge me $40 to work on it since it is no longer under warranty.  On the bright side of things, my cousin Rachel will be coming to NYC for a visit in July with a couple of her girlfriends.  They're staying at a hotel not far from where I work, so I should be able to spend some quality time with her.  She's just a year younger than I am and grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.  Her dad and my dad are 1st cousins.  I haven't seen here in about 5 years or so - maybe 6.  Anyway, I'm really looking forward for her visit.  Also, later this month, Chris's friend, Brad, is coming for a week with a friend of his.  Chris says he sounds excited about coming and we're excited he's coming, so that makes a good match!  Well, I just inserted the final disk of 7 disks which will take in total 33 minutes to run - I would know since this is the 3rd or 4th time I've done this tonight.  Wish me luck!

      Friday night, Chris & I watched The Chronicles of Riddick & I loved it.  Of course, I also liked the first movie, Pitch Black.  I think this one was even better than the first.  Saturday, Chris & I had a very lazy day.  We didn't even get dressed until Cindy & Jackson came.    We kept Jackson last night and we've just had biscuits with syrup.  Jackson's now watching the Osmosis Jones cartoon.  I'm supposed to go to Central Park with Amanda later & I'm really looking forward to getting outside on this beautiful weekend.  Ok, I've got to get a shower and wash this funk off me.  Today, from  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings  I say ... and you think ... ?    1. Colorblind : my Dad  2. Shallow : ditch  3. Erotica : The Village  4. Figment : Fragment  5. Eviction : apartment  6. Composed : literary work  7. Chill : cool  8. Girl : bras (don't ask)  9. California : sunny & warm 10. Bond : Bond girls

      I had such a problem getting onlne tonight!  Turns out that our internet connection wasn't automatically connecting, like it normally does.  Regardless, I am watching the MTV Movie Awards.  And it is absolutely hilarious so far!  Tom Cruise is yum-scrum-di-li-umptuous!!  Chris is at his third Level 2 Class at UCB.  I think he's having a good time so far, but each level gets harder and more intense and I think he sees that right now.  I posted a picture of Berg, but I don't think you can really see how big he is.  He weighs about 15 lbs. and he's very protective of the hallway and doesn't like the men who deliver the weekly box of groceries.  Or the buzzer.  And sometimes the phone.  More sad news:  urlLink Ray Charles died today around 11:35 am at the age of 73 from complications of liver disease .  It's sad to lose both Reagan and Ray Charles within a week's time of each other.  As  urlLink Becca  pointed out, these things usually happen in 3's . . .

      Wow Faye!  I can never space my clothes out like that; I don't have enough!  For all of you fans out there, Faye is a guest blogger on this site.  She's funny, she's brilliant, she's Southern, she's a badass.  Welcome Faye!!  In the spirit of Anne of  urlLink In A Puddle , I will posting a picture of Berg in all his glory.  Coming soon!  There's not much going on right now.  I'm watching President Regan's funeral procession from the plane to the Rotunda where his body will lie for visitation by the public.  This all makes me very sad.  But let me just say that I have such tremendous respect for Nancy Reagan.  She's so graceful.  I've been to more funerals than I can count & while I'm sad Mr. Reagan is now gone (he was one of my favorites), this whole thing makes me think of all of the family & friends I've lost over the years.  I miss them.  But onto happier things: last night, I made  urlLink Thai Peanut Chicken .  I got the recipe from  urlLink KraftFoods.com  and it was absolutely fantastic!  We're having leftovers tonight.

      I'd just like to say that Dennis has good observations....  I've only worn this shirt a few times to work. I think it was once when I had an interview to go to and once when I had a date for lunch. And then today. But I'm only wearing it cause I couldn't find anything to wear that wasn't dirty or a t-shirt.  So, I'm in the back getting a cup pf coffee when Dennis comes up and says, "No clean clothes? You got an interview or a lunch date?" I was like, "Yea! No clean clothes!!! How did you know?" He then informed me that I've only worn this shirt a few times and they were all special occasions.   I so need to go shopping.

      Something that irks the living daylights out of me: coworkers who walk right past me in the morning that don’t say hello or good morning.  They literally won’t talk unless someone else initiates the conversation.  And I just absolutely refuse to do it anymore.  I know that sounds silly and childish but I don’t care.  It’s not like we don’t all talk to each other all the livelong day.  We work in the same area.  We have to look at each other all day long.  Why do they have their noses stuck in the air with their ears shut?  That’s what I miss most about the South; the hospitality and friendliness.  Oh well.  I could complain about that until the cows came home but that won’t get me anywhere.  So, onto bigger and better things.  Chris & I are enjoying our new 6.3 megapixel digital camera.  I’ll be posting some pictures now that I’ve figured out how to do that, but since the pictures are rather large in size, I will be posting pictures from Becca & Trevor’s trip on a separate webpage.  I’ll add the link to the right when I’ve completed it.  I also have new pictures of my nephews that I’ll be posting soon, though the boys are naked in nearly all of the pictures.  What can I say?  We’re Southern & don’t believe in clothes sometimes.  I don’t think there are any shots of any winkies, so I don’t expect child porn charges to be filed anytime soon.  One of the ladies in our office has just walked past handing out copies of the latest sample sales.  A sample sale is a hugely discounted sale of designer brands; anything from Vera Wang to Chanel to Armani to Gucci to Kate Spade to Sean Jean and on and on and on.  While normal prices are slashed up to 90%, everything is still somewhat expensive – especially considering my paycheck.

      In sad news, former President Ronald Reagan has passed away at the age of 93.  According to  urlLink CNN.com :  His office said he died of pneumonia, described as a complication of Alzheimer's disease, a condition he made public in a stirring letter in 1994.   In disturbing news, someone has allowed  urlLink J Lo to marry again .  This time to singer Marc Anthony.  Let's see if this one will last the year mark.  I somehow doubt it, but they could surprise me.  In an effort to do my part, I've joined  urlLink Spirit of America .  If they should need me to, I'll volunteer my time and/or skills - what little I have - to help send aid to those who need it in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I've seen various references to  urlLink Spirit of America  all over the internet & I've always been a late bloomer, so go check it out & volunteer if you can.  They need all the help they can get and they've already done some good in these war-torn countries.  Now, I've taken that first step.  Go take yours.  And while I'm at it, I'm also going to plug  urlLink  Voices of Valor: D-Day: June 6, 1944   written by Douglas Brinkley and Ronald Drez, with help from our very own Anne of  urlLink In A Puddle  who worked on the 2 CDs that come with the book.  Go and check it out.  So far, I've only read what's on the page that is  urlLink linked here  & I'm intrigued.  I plan on picking up the book.  In another piece of sad news, Becca & Trevor left this morning.  I'm sad & I cried on the walk back from putting them in a cab.  I miss them already.  I'll be putting up pictures from their trip in the next few days.  If I can figure out how to add pictures to my blog, then I'll add a couple here and there.  I'll let you know when I have pictures from their trip up.  Yesterday, we went exploring in Central Park.  Neither Chris nor I had ever been that deep into the park we discovered a lot of hidden areas - rape stations as we like to call them.  Needless to say, we promised each other to never venture that far in without someone with us.  There are some really secluded areas with waterfalls & bridges and such.  Pretty cool.  Finally, for this week's  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings :  I say ... and you think ... ?   1.  Charity : give money 2.  Scale : cliffs 3.  Jennifer Lopez : married again?!? 4.  Coercion : terrorism 5.  Meter : measurement 6.  Pressure : earthquake 7.  June : summer 8.  Infestation : summer bugs 9.  Serial killer : The Frighteners (which I watched the other day) 10. Anguish : torment

      So this past week's blogging has been a little sporadic, but next week will be back to normal.  I'm a little sad today since Becca & Trevor will be leaving in the morning.  I'll probably cry like I always do.  I think they're going to stay up all night tonight since they have to leave the apt. at 4 am.  I plan on staying up with them.  I tried staying up last night, but crashed around midnight.  I woke up at 5 this morning to find Chris the Great asleep next to me, with his bedside lamp and the TV on.  But, since you've been lacking, here, ladies & gentlemen, are your  WEEKEND LINKS :  It's about time you've met  urlLink TRAVIS !  Yes, he's the next internet superstar!  And then there's  urlLink ghetto furniture at its best !  If this shows up in my house or the house of anyone I know, I will personally destroy it.  Want to see a picture of  urlLink John Ashcroft made entirely out of pictures of porn ?  Of course you do!   urlLink Just click here .  I don't know about you, but I prefer to have no party favors than  urlLink this !  I would say this is a  urlLink bizarre series of art , but I'm sure someone's loving it.  While I like the style, I just don't think this happens very often.  If so, someone needs new undershorts.  I'm sure some people get off on  urlLink this sort of thing , I just hope I'm never invited over to their house.  You sick, sick f*cks.  This is a  urlLink badass webpage  if ever I saw one.  Watch his eyes when you move around the page.  And finally, here are the  urlLink dirty 2nd cousins of the Care Bears .

      Ok, so I thinks it's obvious - to the world - that we got a little drunk the other night for Becca's 21st birthday.  May I just say that Marines & Fleet Week are now my favorite holiday!  So now Becca & Trevor are somewhere in Chinatown hagling for sunglasses & watches.  I'm so proud!  Unfortunately, I now have to pull myself out of this chair & go in there and do the dishes before I start dinner.  Never stops.  And today's winner of the Yayaempress: What the Fuck Award is:  urlLink Man Commits Suicide After Sex With Hen .  Dude, what the fuck?!?

       YA YA REVOLUTION    Today, our revealing expose on  Ya Ya Empress  continues.   A post from  Friday, October 3, 2003  provides our first definitive proof of her trusty sidekick, sweetly referred to as  Becca .&nbsp; However, she is also known as  Becca The Bruiser  on the undercover circuit.&nbsp; Ashcroft has photographs, magnificently captured in black and white I might add, of BTB holding Mormon missionaries' bicycles over a trash compactor until they agreed to do her evil bidding.&nbsp; The Bruiser has also been known to discreetly do away with top level officials by slipping them genetically altered  Dr. Peppers  with the  fizz of death .&nbsp;   In other news on this day, Ya Ya, sends a secret message out to her supporters for a secret project thinly veiled as televised wrestling.&nbsp; In reality, Ya Ya has masterminded a plan to harvest the transients looked down upon by society into an indestructible army of darkness.&nbsp; Yes, the code name  Smackdown  can mean only one thing - a finely tuned crack whore martial arts squadron.&nbsp; It is a straight man's best fantasy and worst nightmare as he watches them pull those Chinese stars off their nipples and plant them firmly in his chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I  shudder  even now as I think about it.   On  Tuesday, October 6, 2003 , Ya Ya has decided to make her him-bot, formerly known as Chris the Great, into the general of her  Crack Whore Debutantes of Death (CWDOD) &nbsp;by dressing him up as a, and I quote, "transvestite Viking."&nbsp; The CWDOD is on constant standby, ready to respond with one subtle movement of the horn on his helmet, his long blonde pigtails flowing out behind him like a Nazi propaganda film that can only be achieved by a well placed stage fan.&nbsp; (Thank Becca the Bruiser for that one, disguised as a hotel maid with a peg leg and monocle.)    Thursday, October 9, 2003 , shows that Ya Ya has planted her him-bot undercover at the  Mandarin Oriental New York Hotel at Columbus Circle , which is a sinister match with his fatal, chopstick-wielding skills.&nbsp; In addition to stealing small, scented soaps in the shape of Chairman Mao's head, popping the freshness seals on freshly cleaned toilets. misdirecting room service to deliver big juicy steaks to vegetarians and speaking with a bad Chinese accent picked up around, say Cuba, he will be on the ready to steal what Ya Ya has been after for years... the ancient Chinese secret from their laundry services.&nbsp; With it, she could develop secret weapons that could wrinkle freshly pressed clothes within a 50-mile radius of ground zero.&nbsp; There is nothing worse than a wrinkled news anchor, which could effectively destroy the morale of the entire city, or more unthinkable, New Jersey.   Finally, on  Wednesday, October 15, 2003 , we are lucky to find a secret message from BTB to the Ya Ya. (Don't you just love secret code?)&nbsp; "Becca" confirms the chilling effectiveness from Ya Ya's push cart tests and agrees that they should arm Ya Ya's crack whore soldiers with them.&nbsp; Sashaying down the streets on roller skates, and gaudy outfits stolen from the rack of  Frederick's of Hollywood , her crackerjack crack whores will take out the strongest citizens of New York first by snapping their spine from the impact of their shopping cart and then carting off the body in their cart as if it is just another homeless person dressed smartly in an Armani suit.&nbsp; Feeling overly confident, BTB uses the name of her best undercover agent, Mr. Lovan Tomas, and leader of her below 14" feline spy ring.   In her last post for the day, Ya Ya confesses her plan, once again symbolically hidden in code, to steal the testicles of every man in the world.&nbsp; Yes, she talks about someone stealing a baseball at a game, but it only makes patent her true intent for the society she wishes to create - Boys Without Balls (BWB).&nbsp; What diabolical purpose can she have for all of these bollocks?&nbsp; Stay tuned.

      As an insider to the Yaya Empire, it is in great hush-hushness that I expose the true Yaya to you all. I can only do this as she and Chris the Great are overseas.  (I have just finished watching The Bourne Identity and I think I can take over the world, one assassin at a time!) Let us look at a little background history, shall we?   We know that she was born and raised in Louisiana.  She supposedly had a full childhood with regular trips to visit family out of town. Records indicate one arrest when she was just in high school. (Once? In high school??? What????) She was smuggling illegal immigrants in from the borders of Mexico. One can only assume that these immigrants would serve as minions to her ever growing empire.    Is Yaya really in Italy? Do you really believe that she's on a "honeymoon"? Stay tuned to find out.......

       WHO IS THE YA YA EMPRESS?    Hey there, it's Jef from  urlLink Cult of Je f in his first ever guest blog, while Ya Ya Empress and Chris the Great are in Italy.&nbsp; I hope they are having a wonderful time.   To tell you the truth, I don't know Ya Ya (May I call you Ya Ya?) very well.&nbsp; We just collided like two people trying to carry several drinks back to our individual groups of friends in a bar one night, but I just keep coming back to learn more.&nbsp; She's kind of like those little chocolate covered pretzels - you can't eat just one.   So, I thought I might explore and ask the questions others may be too afraid to ask: Who is Ya Ya Empress?&nbsp; What is her evil plan for world domination?&nbsp; Where does she keep her secret chocolate stash?&nbsp; I am determined to probe Ya Ya...  deeply .&nbsp;   First, what is a ya ya?&nbsp; Ya can be an acronym for "Young Adult" and "Yet Another."&nbsp; It is also the feminine for yo yo in the lost Serbian language Shoolencrouch, which links her roots back to the once powerful country of Hotchglosia, whose descendents have now fled to an underground of retail terrorism, flooding American stores with useless Ronco rip-off's such as pasta bowls with built-in colanders, shoes with retractable wheels and devices to bejewel denim jackets.   Secondly, what is an empress?&nbsp;  urlLink Dictionary.com  defines an empress as the woman ruler of an empire or the wife or widow of an emperor.&nbsp; This can mean only one thing.&nbsp; Chris the Great is secret Russian royalty and he has been replaced for her own dark purposes by a him-bot, which is a robot duplicate of the original Christ the Great.&nbsp; She can now rule through her puppet pawn with no one being the wiser... except me, the thorn in her diabolical side.   To begin my research, I have started with her  urlLink first post  from Thursday, October 12, 2003, and I have determined that Ya Ya is a drug user.&nbsp; That's right! You heard it here first.&nbsp; She engages in the dangerous practice of mixing over-the-counter medications together for a Theraflu/Nyquil cocktail.&nbsp; She obviously does not understand how to responsibly use Nyquil. It should only be used to treat colds, sedate hyperactive children and as a morning beverage.&nbsp; Further information gleamed from this post indicates her culvert operation is centered in Midtown Manhattan, which the Muppets once took quite successfully.&nbsp; When she isn't plotting to take over the world, Ya Ya likes to further explore her flannel fetish, which she innocently refers to as PJ's,&nbsp;at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that she believes in the institution of marriage to throw us all off into believing that she is a humble housewife and not&nbsp;the international woman of mystery that she is.&nbsp; She closes her message by waxing on about her enthusiasm for Christian holidays wrapped in pagan traditions and and a future rendezvous with her family, AKA her henchmen/henchwomen.&nbsp; While this may look like a harmless post, I was able to have it analyzed by one of our country's top encryptologists, Dr. Hubert E. Pickens at the University of Podunkville, Alabama.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a special computer program, Dr. Pickens revealed that this post contains a secret message, which is "More diamonds needed for the death ray.&nbsp; Send salami immediately."   I will close for now, but if I should disappear, do not be surprised if the CIA shall contact you in code here.

During my absence,  urlLink Jef of Cult of Jef ,  urlLink Cinderella of Cinderella's Random Thoughts , along with my sisters, Catherine (Cat), and Becca will be filling in.&nbsp; Here are the keys little ones, just clean up after the party & don't break anything valuable.&nbsp; I've already hidden the sex & drug paraphernalia so don't even think of snooping around for it.

      O.K. thought I had this blog thing figured out but tried to post something a minute ago and it just disappeared on me!  Maybe this one will go through.  So I guess YAYA and Chris the Great are just about ready to leave for their Italian vacation, wish I was going with them.  It will be interesting to see what will happen to her blog while she is away!

Today is laundry & clean the apartment day.&nbsp; It totally needs it!&nbsp; I'm trying to wash up all of our clothes that we'll need for Italy.&nbsp; We leave Wednesday & I couldn't be more excited!&nbsp; Amanda will be stopping by every other day to feed Berg and give him some company.&nbsp; I wish he were the type of cat that she could bring back to her apartment to play with her cat, Chloe, but Berg while Berg has a big bark, he's really just a pussy.&nbsp; Yes, pun intended.

      So tonight, Chris-the-Great & I went to a little bar called Faces &amp; Names on 54th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues.&nbsp; Nice little spot, but there has been so much turnover at The Essex House (Hotel), that I don't even know half the people anymore.&nbsp; But I did get to see my favorite gay friend - Damien.&nbsp; He's so absolutely fabulous that he could entertain me all night - not to mention what happens when he gets together with Chris.&nbsp; They ham it up big time!&nbsp; Damien is in some sort of position at The Essex House where he deals with big name stars and their press junkets, etc. that are held at the hotel.&nbsp; He seems to know everyone!   We went&nbsp;to wish Mai good luck on her trip back to Japan, which is where she is from.&nbsp; She'll be going back for good & we wish her the best!&nbsp; Another hotel friend, Kelly, is moving to a little French island for a year.&nbsp; She's saved up enough money and now she's going to spend the next year lounging on a French beach and studying for the LSAT trying to get into law school.&nbsp; That's awesome, too!   Chris-the-Great & I watched a video about Rome last night.&nbsp; It was so exciting and I want to watch it again before we go.&nbsp; We'll start packing this weekend so there's time to run out and pick up&nbsp;anything we're missing&nbsp;before we leave Wednesday.   I'm sitting here posting since I left Chris-the-Great at the bar.&nbsp; You ever just get ancy and need to leave a place?&nbsp; That's what happened tonight & when I told Chris-the-Great that I needed to go, he thought I would be upset that he wanted to stay for another hour or so.&nbsp; I gave him my blessings and he walked me to 7th Avenue, hailed a cab, kissed me&nbsp;and handed me&nbsp;cab fare.&nbsp; I love him.

      Today, the minutes ticked away at a granny snail's pace at work. It should have been at least two days - that's how long it was! And I didn't have a single thing to do pretty much the entire day besides track down presentations for our Production Dept that my boss was reviewing. Oh, and I strutted around in my new white skirt with the purple and tan flowers on it that I bought yesterday, along with the purple v-neck shirt that matches. Everyone has complimented me on it - even my boss who for the past 3 years has taken absolutely no notice of what I've worn. Today he says, "I really like what you have on today." I'm like, "Thanks!" And that was that.&nbsp; Until I get off the train today at my stop after work.&nbsp; I walk down the first set of stairs, go through the turnstile, round the corner and nearly bump into a girl wearing my skirt and a lighter purple shirt.&nbsp; Damn, thought I'd gotten hold of a good skirt there, but now I'm afraid I'll be seeing it everywhere.   The weather is really crappy today and if I remember correctly, the weather report this morning was for monsoon-like rains. Lovely. Because that's the kind of rain we've had the entire day. Perhaps one day soon it will decide to get sunny & warm before "summer" is over. Oh! Lightening just now! With the faintest hint of thunder. What I wouldn't give to be back on the farm with a nice tin roof listening to that rain come down!   From what I hear, my nephew, Jackson, is in Louisiana having a good ole time. It's been reported that he loves this Grandaddy's new pond and tractor. His grandmother, Mimi as we call her, has already bought him a pair of rubber boots and some new tennis shoes - or sneakers as these Yankees call them - and some sandals.   Oh! I nearly forgot - I saw a girl get hit by a car yesterday! Ok, maybe I should say that with a little less enthusiasm: i saw a girl get hit by a car yesterday. She wasn't really hurt. She was jaywalking and a cab driver was backing up so he could parallel park along 49th Street &amp; 7th Avenue. He bumped her and she did the rollover & flip thing in her teeny tiny skirt. I'm sure someone caught sight of her undies, but not me. Not that I'm interested in that sort of thing - you know, other girls undies. Anyway, all's well &amp; good with her, I guess, though I imagine her leg has to hurt today where he hit her.   So earlier, I ventured over to Newsfeed - News for Bloggers, News for Junkies, where I stumbled upon this story:     urlLink US food scientists working for the US military have developed a dried food ration that troops can hydrate by adding dirty water or urine.   Now, I don't know about you, but I just don't think I could live with myself knowing that I rehydrated my food by pissing on it. I just couldn't do it. You?   And then I read a story on MSNBC.com today that tells us what we already know:  urlLink Howard Stern, blogs and voter virgins hold the key to the election.    I watched this video a couple of weeks ago, but since I've heard about it all over the news I figured people might be looking for the link to  urlLink This Land &nbsp;by brothers Greg and Evan Spiridellis.&nbsp; It's a spoof of this fabulous show we call Election Year 2004.&nbsp; Watch it!&nbsp; You'll love it!

      So Chris-the-Great was on the Graham Norton Effect last night.&nbsp; His part was about 45 minutes into the show.&nbsp; They were doing a scene where earlier, they sent an audience member backstage to be painted so that he could hide in plain site on the streets of Manhattan.&nbsp; As soon as Graham Norton spotted the guy, they called him on his cell phone to see if that was him.&nbsp; That was Chris-the-Great's cue to walk this dog past the guy.&nbsp; Chris stopped and started talking to the guy and his dog started sniffing the guy's crotch.&nbsp; They don't show Chris-the-Great's face, which is good since they'll be able to use him again this season.&nbsp; Once they show his face, that's it until next season.&nbsp; I'm so proud of him!&nbsp; I know this was no big part or anything, but it's a start and it will give him some experience with TV and he got paid.&nbsp; Always a good thing!  I am so ready to sleep in a bit on Saturday.&nbsp; I woke up yesterday morning thinking it was Saturday - you can imagine my disappointment when I realized that the alarm&nbsp;going off was meant to wake me up early for a reason.  Tomorrow, I'm heading out to New Jersey for what I hope is atleast a&nbsp;dry day if not sunny.&nbsp; I bought a&nbsp;new swimming suit yesterday even though I may not get to use it.&nbsp; Ok, I must go get ready for work.

      So Chris-the-Great did a spot on the Graham Norton Effect but I don't know when it will air.&nbsp; Sometime next week, I would assume but since I don't watch it all the time, I don't really know when it comes on.&nbsp; I'll let you know more as I find out more.   Anyway, Olivia & I went out for martinis last night - my first martini.&nbsp; I had one raspberry, one strawberry and one apple which I didn't finish.&nbsp; I would have been sick if I had finished the third one especially since I hadn't had dinner yet.&nbsp; I came home to pig out of Wheat Thins and cheese sprinkled with Tony Chacherey's seasoning.   So this time week, we'll be on a plane to Italy!&nbsp; Three days in Rome, three days in Florence & three days in Venice.&nbsp; I'm so ready for some vacation!&nbsp; But first, this Saturday, I'm going to a coworkers house in New Jersey.&nbsp; I'm meeting up with 3 or 4 other girls from work to take the hour long bus trip.&nbsp; We'll be hanging out by the pool all day drinking so it's good no ones driving.&nbsp; Maybe I'll come away with a little bit of a tan.&nbsp; I may have to go buy a new swimming suit.

      Mr. Mike & Jackson left at 6:15 this morning for Louisiana.&nbsp; I enjoyed their visit, but I sure wish&nbsp;our aptartment was&nbsp;bigger.&nbsp; I've been up since 5 am, so I'm looking forward to turning in early tonight.  &nbsp;  After 3 martinies (Raspberry, Strawberry & Apple) with Olivia after work today, I am finally home watching BIG on the Discovery Channel.&nbsp; Chris-the-Great is off taping some segment on the  urlLink Graham Norton Effect .&nbsp; I'll let you know when it is supposed to air.&nbsp; I'm proud of Chris-the-Great!&nbsp; It's taken some time but I think he's finally found something that captures his attention and he finds interesting - improve/sketch comedy, not the Graham Norton Effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've been cruising through what blogs I can at work, but our IT dept blocks so many of my daily reads.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, let me tell you about this:&nbsp; I think maybe I can't remember who reminded me why blogging is for me, but here goes:&nbsp; It's the glimpses into someone's life - their everyday mundane life - that they choose to share with me.&nbsp; It's those priveleged moments that they&nbsp;choose to pass along to those they've never met.&nbsp; It's sweet & kind moments that they think no one will give a rat's ass about, and yet they post it anyway not really knowing why.&nbsp; It's the drunkin posts I give after going out drinking with Olivia.

      Chris-the-Great had his level 2 graduation show this afternoon &amp; they were great!&nbsp; 10 times better than his level 1 graduation show, but they've worked their asses off and it shows.&nbsp; I'm very proud of him! &nbsp; Other than that, we didn't do a whole lot today.&nbsp; After his show, Chris-the-Great and his classmates went out for a couple of drinks while Mike, Cindy &amp; I came home&nbsp;and watched  urlLink Love Actually .&nbsp; Great movie though it seems they could have made a couple of movies out of all of those characters and we could have gotten to know all of the characters a little better.&nbsp; But then again, it would have been a totally different movie.&nbsp; So, long story short, I loved  urlLink Love Actually ! &nbsp; Last night, we went to eat at this place called  urlLink Neo's  which does this fusion sushi &amp; it was fabulou!&nbsp; It was a little pricey, but definitely worth it.&nbsp; Afterward, we went to UCB and watched the 9 pm show -  urlLink Respecto Good vs. Elvis .&nbsp; Very funny indeed! &nbsp; That's about it really.&nbsp; Chris-the-Great &amp; Mike are watching  urlLink The Road Warrior  on TV.&nbsp; Very strange movie.&nbsp; Funny to watch it now that it's over 20 years old (1981).&nbsp; The costumes are great, let me tell ya.&nbsp; And great storyline.&nbsp; Ok, not really. &nbsp; Mike has one more day here in NYC.&nbsp; Cindy is taking off work tomorrow so they can all hang out.&nbsp; Early Tuesday morning, Mike is taking Jackson, my nephew, back to Louisiana for about a month.&nbsp; And since Chris-the-Great's parents are building their new barn on their 80 or so acres of land in  urlLink Richland Parish , Jackson will have plenty to keep him busy.&nbsp; I hear there's some wood that needs stacking &amp; some turtles that need to come out of the new pond.&nbsp; Ah yes, cheap child labor!&nbsp; All in exchange for a little spending money, some tractor &amp; 4-wheeler driving among other fun stuff.&nbsp; I wish I were going!

      Another day, another random trip to Brooklyn.&nbsp; Well, Coney Island anyway.&nbsp; My father-in-law, Mike, came in yesterday from Louisiana.&nbsp; He's staying with us this time around.&nbsp; Friday night, Mike, Cindy &amp; I went to see Chicago starring Paige Davis as Roxie Hart.&nbsp; While the show was great &amp; I love me some Paige Davis, there was a woman in black leather underwear &amp; fishnet body stocking&nbsp;who had a fantastic body!&nbsp; I think I was watching her more than ole Paige.&nbsp; I'm glad Chris-the-Great wasn't there or he'd have left me on the spot.  &nbsp;  Anyway, today, Mike, Jackson &amp; I went to Chinatown and then on to Coney Island on a whim.&nbsp; We had time to kill.&nbsp; Mike &amp; I had never been to Coney Island &amp; I definitely want to go back when I have more time.&nbsp; We walked along the boardwalk and onto this great long pier where people were throwing crab&nbsp;baskets out with raw chicken.&nbsp; They were catching these small crabs that really weren't worth eating, so I don't know why they were keeping them.&nbsp; Not my problem.&nbsp; We ended up riding the Q train from one end (at Coney Island) to the other end (at 57th Street).  &nbsp;  Afterward, we met up with Cindy, John &amp; Chris to go eat at Neo's, which is a Japanese Fusion Sushi restaurant.&nbsp; Nice place &amp; some of the best sushi I've had yet.&nbsp; A little pricey, but great!&nbsp; After that, we went to the UCB and watched Respecto Montebon during the 9 pm show.&nbsp; Now I'm about to head to bed.&nbsp; Chris-the-Great has to go to work in the morning - 7 am.&nbsp; Poor thing.&nbsp; I'm planning on sleeping in until Berg wakes me.

      I found  urlLink this video  via Daniel at  urlLink ...was I there?  and it is hilarious!!  Warning!!  Not safe for work & you'll need your speakers.  Chris-the-Great and I are about to go watch some improv comedy at the UCB.  I haven't been since Brad & Beth were up here for a visit.  Update on Mamaw Ilva:  [Background: she had a heart attack Saturday and was in ICU; she's 80-yrs-old] She's in a room now and is in high spirits & says she never been so popular with all of the phone calls & flowers, etc.  She sounds good and I could hear my Papaw Leo coughing in the background when I called.  They're going to try to regulate her blood pressure with medicine and start her on a cardiac rehab program.  There's no blockage, which is good, cause we're beef people.  Maybe that's a good side effect of a diet rich in home grown red meats & vegetables.  Gotta love her!  Well, I should go pull Chris-the-Great away from his Playstation.  He's been playing XIII which is a RPG or role playing game.

      Last night, Chris-the-Great & I went to hang out with some friends we hadn't seen in about a year.  They moved to Washington DC, bought a house & had another kid - they already had one.  It was really great to see them & I didn't realize how much I'd missed them until I saw them again last night.  They will leave Monday morning so I think we're going to hang out with them again this afternoon - after I do laundry & before going to the  urlLink UCB  tonight.  Today from  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings , I say ... and you think ... ?    1. Crippling : Devestating  2. Tough : Hard  3. Slinky : Red Dress  4. Slogan : Catch Phrase  5. Stuffed : With Cheese  6. Instructions : Please Follow Them  7. Expletive : F*ck Off!  8. Cartoon : Saturday Mornings  9. Toddler : Full of Engergy 10. Insinuation : Blame

      I'm a wee bit upset right now because I just found out that my grandmother had a heart attack.  My parents are on their way there now, but I can't seem to put it out of my head regardless of the fact that there's nothing I can do for anyone this far away from home.  I called my sister, Cat, and she's promised to call me no matter the time of day or night if she hears anything.  I can only wish her the best and that she'll begin feeling better soon & perhaps that her doctors will step up and treat her instead of trying to pass her heart problems off on her gall bladder or whatever other lame excuse they can come up with.  I wish I were there at the hospital with them.

      And now for your Saturday links:  These are some  urlLink pretty cool bears , just run your pointer over them.  And here's a little story about a couple who attended a concert but then decided they wanted to play a  urlLink more active role .  Lord, may I never drink that much that I would do something like that!  I just don't know that many people who would have sex on stage at a concert.  This is a fun little  urlLink optical illusion  - it's just a little hard to look at first thing in the morning.  And from the same website, I found a picture of  urlLink this toilet  that I've heard so much about.  You can see outside the toilet, but they can't see in.  Crazy!  I wish I knew where this was.  I've been waiting for this to come out for a while now:  urlLink Kerry Poppa .  The game where John Kerry's head explodes.  Loving it.

       urlLink Anchorman with Will Ferrell  was pretty funny - not as funny as Dodgeball, but funny.  Chris-the-Great is about to go out with his friends & I'm staying home since I had enough Jack & Coke last night to tide me over through tonight.  I'm about to watch VH1's Behind The Music: Guns-N-Roses.  They played this the other day and people raved about this, so I can't not watch it.  I'm obviously not the only one who has noticed this, but thanks to Rita of  urlLink Res Ipsa Loquitur  & Matt of  urlLink Drudge Report 2004 , we can all get one collaborative look at what's unfolding in front of our very eyes. I'd like to join in in saying: GET A ROOM!!  I haven't had time to check out the entire site, but you should  urlLink Play along with the Saddam Hussein Dead Pool ! Thanks to  urlLink Becca  for that one!

      I'm sorry Cat, but it seems that you may never get your chance at Kenny Rogers. He's just become the  urlLink father of twins . (He has 3 children from a previous marriage.)  I think most of us have seen The Passion of the Christ and are now familiar with the actor who played Jesus, James (Jim) Caviezel. It seems that on a recent trip to New Mexico, the locals mistook him for the real thing and began  urlLink requesting miracles from the actor .  Just wondering: Why is it that just about every IT dept I've come across are full of a bunch of arrogant b@st@rds? Not only are they arrogant, but they have also blocked half of the blogs I read at work. A$$hats!!  Harvey over at  urlLink Bad Example  has answered the Precision Guided Humor assignment of coming up with a  urlLink theme song for Michael Moore .  By the way, a belated HAPPY BIRTHDAY goes our to our own el presidente: George W Bush!  Sorry, I'm late with that big man!  Thanks to  urlLink Uptown Girl  who gave me something fun to do that didn't include porn.  She has a  urlLink picture of Kerry & Edwards and invites you to supply a caption  in the comments section.  There are some pretty funny ones already posted, but I challenge anyone to give it a whirl!  And last, by far far not least, thanks to Court of  urlLink Viva la France  for her recipe for Fromage Blanc or Creole Cream Cheese!!  I've personally never had it, but I'm willing to give it a shot.  Fromage Blanc or Creole Cream Cheese 1 gallon skim milk 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 Rennet tablet (you can find these in the grocery store by the ice cream toppings)  Heat milk to 80 or 90 degrees. Stir in buttermilk and rennet and set aside at room temperature. If you have to cover it, use cheesecloth. After 24 hours, you will have curds. Pour this into a mold (I used a colandar or you can get a plastic container and punch holes in the bottom) and allow to drain for another day or so.   The fromage is ready when it's no longer dripping.  In Louisiana, they usually pour cream or half and half over it to serve. You can also find recipes using fromage blanc/creole cream cheese from Chef John Folse and Emeril. It can be both a dessert or a meal-type food. For example, in Alsace, they serve it with garlic, onions, and roasted potatoes.  A couple notes on texture--when I finished mine, it had the consistency of ricotta. To get it more like French fromage blanc, I poured a little milk and half and half in it and used a blender to whip it.  Oh, and if you're a Fromage Blanc virgin, the best way to eat this is with strawberries. And maybe a little sugar on top.  Delish.

      Ok, onto the soapbox: I'm getting irritated again. One of my friends is so very moody & a little b*tchy. Instead of getting bent out of shape over it, I'm trying not to let it bother me. I just hate it when she's in one of her "moods." I don't need that kind of shit on my Tuesday-that-feels-like-Monday. Update: she's being nicer now. Her Midol must have kicked in.  In the political arena, John Kerry has finally made a decision for once in his life: He's chosen John Edwards as his VP running mate. I can honestly say that if John Edwards had been the Democratic pick, I would be having a harder time deciding whom to vote for in November. As it is, I can't stand John Kerry and would rather not associate myself with that man at all. I know others can say the same for George Bush, but this is my blog and I'll decide whom I vote for.  You liked those 2 uses of the word "whom" didn't you? Ok, so I never would have chosen them if spellcheck hadn't picked up on it but it does make me sound smarter, now doesn't it?  In Vacation News: we got our passports early Saturday morning! The mailman rang my bell while I was half asleep, though I did have enough wits about me to remember to pull on a robe. Thanks be to Jesus cause I was wearing a little Victoria's Secret pink ballet slip that is oh-so-comfortable!  Unfortunately, I just found out that our camera that we loaned to Sergio was stolen while he was in Puerto Rico. We lost our $300 camera and $100 memory card and he lost over 150 pictures - and some were pretty wild from what I hear! I'm not that stressed about the camera since Sergio said he would replace it, but I hate that he's out that money and that he's lost all of those pictures. Lesson learned: things get stolen in Puerto Rico.  For the good of your funny bone,  urlLink click here !  You like that  urlLink farting cat , don't you?  Chris-the-Great saw it and sat there giggling on the couch with tears rolling down his face.  It must be a good one.  OK, last one.  I promise!  Here's a funny joke for you no matter what your religion:  There were 3 good arguments that Jesus was black  1. He called everyone "brother"  2. He liked Gospel  3. He couldn't get a fair trial   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Jewish:  1. He went into His Fathers business  2. He lived at home until he was 33  3. He was sure his Mother was a virgin and his mother was sure he was God.   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Italian:  1. He talked with his hands  2. He had wine with every meal  3. He used olive oil   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was a Californian:  1. He never cut his hair  2. He walked around barefoot all the time  3. He started a new religion   But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Irish:  1. He never got married  2. He was always telling stories  3. He loved green pastures   But the most compelling evidence of all - 3 proofs that Jesus was a WOMAN:  1. He had to feed a crowd at a moment's notice when there was no food  2. He kept trying to get a message across to a bunch of men who just didn't get it  3. Even when he was dead, He had to get up because there was more work for him to do.

      Not much happening today.  I have the day off and don't really have a thing planned.  I might walk down to Steinway Street and go check out The Children's Place to see if they have any sales.  That's about it.  I'll be back later.  In the spirit of  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings : I say ... and you think ... ?    1. Resignation : goodbye old job!  2. Coupling : requires a couple  3.

      Happy 4th of July!!  I especially want to wish our friend Jeremy who is in Baghdad right now searching for insurgents &  urlLink Blackjack , of course, because he's in Iraq, too.  What did yall do for the 4th?  Chris-the-Great & I went down to Astoria Park here in Queens.  We layed out for a while and played frisbie & threw the football back and forth.  Then we walked along the water toward Hoyt Avenue.  We stopped at one spot underneath the Triboro Bridge and when the waves washed ashore, you could hear the water going over all of the glass.  It made a tinkling sound.  Crazy.  There was so much trash and garbage washed up it was pretty nasty.  Hope everyone has had a good weekend and if you're off tomorrow, drink a beer for me!

      Spider Man 2 was an excellent movie!  At least twice as good as the first movie - perhaps better.  Chris-the-Great was cheering like a little boy in a toy store.  Tonight, he's at class and then he's going to watch a little improv.  I'm sitting here watching Most Extreme Elimination Challenge on Spike TV.  I love this show!  It's basically just footage of people falling and hurting themselve, but it's a Japanese game show dubbed over by some very sarcastic Americans.  Mucho funny!  So Chris-the-Great bought an English-to-Italian phrase book yesterday and we've been learning a few words every day.  I can't wait!  I've already started buying some small things for our trip but I still need to get a converter for our electronics.  We're bringing our laptop, so I hope to post during the trip.  Later this month, Mr. Mike (my father-in-law), Cindy & I will be going to see  urlLink Chicago  starring Paige Davis from TLC's Trading Spaces.  Ok, I'm going to nap on the couch for a bit until Sergio comes down to borrow our small digital camera since he's heading to Puerto Rico for a bit.

      OH... Lookey here!  I thought I'd come tinker around for a bit.  What do we think we can find (*oops, trip, crash*)?  Damit, she told me not to use the good China.  Does falling into it really count?  Better go look for the super glue.  (*opens large drawer in the kitchen*).  Now why, oh why, would somebody have so many batteries?!

       IN ZE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME   Dear purveyors of freedom:  I am writing this from an Apple Store in the  urlLink Tlaquepaque Arts and Crafts Village  in Sedona, Arizona.  I barely escaped the truck stop when I was ambushed by the pussy posse. I turned around just as the hind quarters of a tortoise shell landed in my face. I would have been blinded if it were not for my cheap, imitation J-Lo sunglasses. It's not easy subduing ninja kitties, but luckily I was able to wield saltwater taffy like a whip, a little skill I picked up from dating an American Airlines flight attendant with an Indiana Jones fetish. "Oh Professor Jones, open up my ancient tomb." By the time I was through with them, the only thing you could see was their little tails whipping back and forth from under a Ms. Pac-Man machine.  I trust no one now. In order to blend in with the locals, I have begun wearing a black beret, a t-shirt with black horizontal stripes and painted a thin black moustache on my upper lip. I speak in a fake French accent and spy on suspicious characters by pretending to paint on my easel. The fact that I do not have a canvas seems unimportant to others. I know Ya Ya's hidden lair is somewhere in the iron mountain. I suspect her testicular ray canon is in there, waiting to steal the testicles of men all over ze planet, replacing them with little wooden decoys. I must have proof to be sure, dear readers, therefore, tomorrow I head down into the Sunshine Valley Nudist Colony to see if I can knock on wood.  Stay tuned. I feel Mr. Lovan Tomas is near; something smells fishy.  Resistantly Yours,  Jef

      Ah ha! and Oh No!!! It seems that my cover has been blown. Mr. Lovan Tomas has been pulled from the operations and put in the warehouse to oversee the training of the other kittens. He will for sure make our little kitten rebels the most rebellious yet! (How did this Jef know that Mr. Lovan Tomas was orange? How?) We have sent his "sister" Sativa in his place. She is equipped with the voice of Shel Silverstein. No one will ever suspect those big "Puss in Boots" eyes to be pushing a laundry cart. I have also sent our neighbor's oldest boy. He isn't much for taking orders, but he can't stay away from cute kittens.  You might recognize him when you see him reading a Ramona Quimby book.   Yaya checked in with headquarters this morning from Florence, Italy. She says that Italy is beautiful. I wonder if she'd had time to "make friends" there.   As Yaya's next of kin here, I am honored to wish Bridget Marie Verret a very HAPPY BRITHDAY!!!!! And I shall sing...."HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU. I'M SO GLAD YOU WOKE UP! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUUUUUUU!!!!" I hope you have a great birthday and we see you soon!  Well, until the next mission.....

       ON THE RUN FROM MR. LOVAN TOMAS &amp; THE 14" FELINE SPY RING   I am writing to you from a 24-hour truck stop just outside of Licking, Missouri. The warm glow of the neon flamingos and palm trees seemed comforting. I had to leave Atlanta quite suddenly when I heard the doorbell ring. I placed my ear against the door and heard several cats meowing in hushed tones. Suddenly, one of them tried the doorknob and I was out the back door like a cork out of a champagne bottle at a New Year's party for AA members with esteem issues.  I'm afraid that I just have a few items that I grabbed while in fight or flight mode. Looking at them now, it's clear to me that a state of panic is not the best frame of mind to be in when deciding what supplies to take when you have become a political fugitive. I have a lip balm, nail clippers, some beef jerkey, a copy of Ricky Martin's greatest hits and a box of Jello pistachio pudding mix. I'm sure McGyver could do wonders, but I will probably have to venture over the Dairy Queen on the other side of the truck stop for sustenance.  I thought I had lost them when I crossed the border into Alabama. Feeling confident, I stopped to get something to eat. When I returned from the restroom, I found an entire pussy patrol ordering combo meals. What was I thinking when I stopped at  Captain D's ? I managed to escape with the cats in hot pursuit. I jumped onto the back of an 18-wheeler and shouted at them in a mocking tone, "Ha! Try to get me you bunch of pussies!" However, my arrogance soon dissipated as I saw an orange tabby hoist a rocket launcher onto his shoulder while a cool calico lined me up in the crosshairs. Fortunately, the truck just made it over the top of the hill and vanished as I saw a nearby billboard for Stuckey's erupt into flames.  What do they want from me? What do they think I have? Well, I do know one thing - they'll never catch me alive. Wait! Of course, they must want-  What's that sound? OH NO!
