      Feeling alone. Left out. Unloved. Uncared for. Misunderstood.   "You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."  I shall learn to see the imperfectness in my classmates and love them perfectly...   I'm sad...

      I'm trying and am still trying... but why is it so hard to shake off this overly sensitivity of mine? I hate this feeling... I'm afraid... Really afraid that this feeling will affect me alot...   I really don't like this current job at Koh San. It's mental torture and physically too. The peepz there aren't really totally that friendly. The lights there make me dizzy and wanna puke. Time seemed to pass SO, and i emphasize SO slowly there compared to Kuri-kuri or New Otani. I have decided by hook or by crook, I will be quit after next week. Don't wanna leave just like that when they are still shorthanded. I hate myself for being so kind-hearted at times.   10 Reasons for hating myself: 1. The spirit of depression seem to be able to possess me easily.  2. I'm a violent, ungentle, unloving, uncaring, unsensitive, useless girlfriend. Sorry my love. 3. My habitual lateness is causing me to lose confidence in myself. Especially when I have to meet my classmates to discuss projects and I start thinking they don't like me because I'm late. 4. Constantly lacking of sleep and not concentrating in lessons and memory system failing seriously.  5. Always putting myself to all sorts of torture and have regrets later on. 6. Failing to treat my friends well. Sorry Mel, sorry Liz, sorry KJ, sorry Mun, sorry Weiming, sorry Vinc, sorry Mad, sorry Baoting, sorry Dawn, sorry Jas, sorry Zhen, sorry Jon, sorry all my friends. 7. No discipline in everything I do.  8. No self control. 9. No money management. Sorry Mum, sorry Dad, sorry Ben. 10. Failing to treat God the way He treats me. Forgive me, Father.  I'm suffering from serious depression and paranoidion. I serously need to repent and read the bible for directions. Jesus, save me.

      Haiz... Yesterday was so irritated by blogspot! Wrote a whole load of stuff&nbsp;but when I click on Publish Post, the whole thing was gone!! Hmmph! Nvm...   Anyway, what I wanted to say is that I have decided that yesterday night, which now also seems to be,&nbsp;was a good and right time to write down what has been happening to me these past 2 weeks which caused me to turn into a paranoid freak. Some people thought the main reason to be Ben but the truth is... he only contributed a little of it... =X Anyhow, the main reason was my poly life. My new life in school... which I haven gotten used to yet...  Guess it all started when Ben left for Philippines... I began to feel alone... In school, I'm constantly thinking that my classmates don't like me, while in actual fact, well... they don't hate me or dislike me... Really don't understand why I have such thoughts too! Horrible me... Guess it's all spiritual attack. Moreover, I'm always thinking that time is not enough. Everyday seems to pass by so quickly before I&nbsp;could&nbsp;really summarize exactly what I've done. Plus the stress from schoolwork... Felt so suffocated...   Anyway, I'm on the path to recovery! So my friends... Just give me some time and wait... I'll be back! The same old smiling happy lover of God ME! =P I love God, I love Jesus, I love the Spirit Man in me, I love people, I love everybody!!! Last of all, I will try to be the very best of me and I love ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Though it's still long from now, but the feeling of another person gone is really unbearable. Guess life's all about people coming in and leaving...  At least one good news for now is that Ben will be coming tomorrow~ Yay!!! FINALLY~ Miss him so much~! Hehez... My parents and I will be going down to fetch him. Lucky him~   How~~~ Haiz... Up till now I still don't have friends... So sad lorx... Why~~~ =(((((( Jesus, please bring me to the right people, to speak the right words. I love You & truly You.  FF&BSci online quiz tomorrow but I haven't read anything yet. Really don't know what is the matter with me nowadays. Never pay attention in class, kept missing lectures in the morning, don't know what homework to do and when it is due. Worse still, not even sure what to do for some of the homework/projects. HOW~~~

      He called again!!! ;)  I really wanna give thanks to God!!! Even though I broke fast today, but he still blessed me with abundance of food!!! After work today, I brought home with me 2 packet of hotplate beef cum rice, 3 packets of sushi & 2 chawanmushi! Hehez... But sadly I only had like 1/4 of everything... I love Jesus! I love Jesus! I love Jesus!!!  Very tired now... Gotta sleep early or I'll be missing my 3rd week of MicroEcons. Haiz... Project deadlines coming up... But I don't know what I'm supposed to do!!!   Oh yes Mel, I think you will have to be disappointed. Cause getting a dog is really quite impossible. Up till now, I don't have the money, nor any idea where to even find a dog! U try praying to God lar k? Must have faith that He will give it to you somehow...

      I hate Ben! I hate Ben! I hate Ben!!! &nbsp; This was how I felt in the morning... &nbsp; But 15 mins ago he just called me. Told me that his handphone went flat. Again. That's why he couldn't called me last night. Said he tried but the batt was flat and everyone was asleep. Haiz... Oh... Why and how did I fall so deeply in love with this man...  &nbsp; Was late for only 6 mins this morning. But still, I took a cab from Tampines interchange. Stupid cab driver didn't had change for $10 and forced me to go beg some people for small notes. How embarassing can this get... Doesn't he know that the whole campus has like thousands of people and we are not all friends? Haiz... God~ Love love... Must love all people.  &nbsp; Was feeling somewhat lonely again. Shed a few tears last night. PMS was over. But why??? Think I'm undergoing depression. AGAIN. Couldn't find the source to it. Why bother~ it will go over in a while anyway.&nbsp;Life's getting bored. Wake up... School... Home... Computer... Sleep... Wake up... School... Work... Home... Computer... Sleep... I need something to spice up my life alittle. What should it be...?  &nbsp; Oh yes! I broke fast... Haiz... Forgive me Father... I was really hungry...&nbsp;Friends~ Where did all my friends go to~~~ Sunday is coming!!!

      Darling called me this morning! Hehez... Actually I received his msg saying that he didn't called me yesterday night cause he didn't bowl very well and wasn't in a good mood. Later on in the early afternoon he called me. Told me he would call me at night again but so far haven't received any call yet. =(  Anyhow, was wakened up by my mum's scolding this morning. Yes, I know I'm suppose to go to school but I'm just simply too tired. So in the end I waited for my mum to go to work and I went back to sleep. =X Have been missing IntH&T lecture for 3 consecutive weeks already. Don't know what I'm doing.   Some of the projects' deadlines are coming up. Been staring at the computer this afternoon for 5 hours straight! My degrees gonna shoot up again... =~( Still thinking whether I should get a laptop. NO MONEY!!!

      I'm missing him loads... He didn't call me today! Hmmph! Wonder how is he doing and how did he bowl...   Anyway, I was supposed to meet Mel and Jon at the airport at 11am this morning to study but I woke at 1pm and slack at home till about 4pm before heading for the airport. We stayed there till 7pm then Mel and Jon decided to go for a movie. So we went to Tampines Mall and catch 'Meangirls'. Cool show. Worth the money. By the way, I just realised that "The Moscow Circles" is just beside TM! When Ben comes back, I'm gonna pester him... =X  Got to study now but many distractions... Need to study for another one more hour to complete study hours. I MISS HIM!!!   There's so many movies that I wanna watch!!! How... I need money... By the way, anyone giving away dogs? Please help me to ask around and let me know. Deadline is reaching soon...

      Stayed for overnight prayer meeting last night that's why didn't have the energy to write yesterday night. Ben flew this morning. My mum sacrificed her sleep to send him off too. He will be back only on thu. I'm missing him already. Please take good care my love. Hope he bowls well in Manila and win something back.  Went out for cell group today. Junhe will be booking in NS on thu, yes the day when Ben comes back. I will miss him too. Time flies past really fast. From the first time he came to church, to the time when he gave his heart to God, till now... this baby christian slowly growing. Though it's only a few months but I can't deny that we have indeed develop a kind of relationship. A bond that God has placed between us. All I can wish for and pray now is for him to keep his faith well. We had a sort of 'farewell' part for him today. Sang at his previous workplace; "Party World KTV". The room was free but we had to pay only for the drinks. Cheap like anything... for a KTV room that is. All of us had a great time fellowshipping with each other. I will miss him too. Really... The joys he brought to our cell group.  To Junhup: You must endure and remain faithful ya? Never give up on God cause He will never give up on you!   I'm getting tired. I'm missing people. Good night.

      Today is horrible! I had menstrual cramp the WHOLE day and it was like hell~ The contraction of the womb can really kill a person! Anyway, most of my day, I couldn't concentrate in class cause the pain was simple too irritating! Joo and Sara even tried to lie to me by giving me a lozenges telling me that it helps the stomach and I actually believe them! *Hmmph!* But anyway, luckily later on I took a headache panadol pill and it actually helps! Hahaz... So miraculously I was healed. Praise the Lord!  After school, Mel went down to TP to meet me. We went together to meet Ian, her beloved cousin. He treated us to a great meal~ I was like another 2 months pregnant... Hahaz! After the meal, he bought mascara and 2 Giordano shirts for Mel. She's so blessed!   And after everything, I went down to Kovan to find my darling. Finally I get to see him after 3 days! Hehez... love love love him~!   Still don't know what to get for Mel... HOW??? Mel~ I don't have the money to get a dog!!!!! Can a stray one do? I tell you where the dog is, you go collect k? =P bleahz...   To Liz: Hope you are recovering fast and coping well with school work! Though I never msg you doesn't mean that I don't love you anymore k? Must still take good care wor! Love you always~! *hugs*

      In school now... Didn't manage to update my blog yesterday thanks to Mel. She really cute larx she... From the first day i step into her house, there were never any 'rules in my room'. Don't know what caused her to do so but she has just created a set of rules that her friends, even her good friend like me!, have to follow once we are in her room.  Anyway, yesterday's bible seminar was good! Pst. Kong preached really well. Now I'm all ready and set to win souls for the kingdom of God! Hehez... To all my unchurched friends: Watch out for my return! I love God and am loving Him more everyday. He is indeed the only way. I want to go heaven. I want to live in a place where satan has no say at all. I want to be with Jesus everyday, every minute, every hour.   I miss Ben... He is having range training this week and will have to stay in camp throughout. I can only get to see him on fri when he comes to church. He is a great boyfriend and I will strive to be his best girlfriend ever! Hes leaving next week (I think) for Philipines. Die... recently memory system down very badly. Kept on forgetting the dates he told me he will be leaving singapore and also many other stuffs. God~ increase my memory capacility~  Mel's birthday is coming... 28 July. To Mel: if you are reading this, remember I have bible study! =XxX Oops... Anyway, she wants a surprise. But seriously speaking, I've really run out of ideas. BUT I'll try my best... k Mel? TRY...   Gotta do my work soon! Running out of time... TatZ!

      Another day has passed. Well, Liz is fine now. At least she's home safely. Loved by the ones around her. I'm glad she realised it and really cherish them from now onwards. After much thinking, I realise that I'm not really that a good friend after all. Don't ask me why. I can't answer myself either. Used to think that just caring and worrying for a friend on the quiet side is enough. But I guess I was wrong. Love still needs to be shown on the outside to really be known. Hope I learn to love even more as well...  Couldn't wake up this morning so i missed lecture... again. Was feeling kinda lost in the afternoon. All of a sudden I was afraid that I couldn't cope with poly life. Cause it's mostly individual's work. I feel helpless at times. So sad...  I miss God. I haven really been talking much to Him lately cause constantly getting headaches and feeling tired. Hope I can sense His presence in a powerful way tomorrow. I miss Jesus. I want to praise Him... Love you Father!

      Haiz... So many unexpected things happen within such a short period of time... I'm feeling so very tired right now. Well, its not really 'many' but anyhow it all just made me so physically tired now. Dying...  Last night was the victory dinner which marks the ending of the 5th inter-club league. How time flies... 4 months ago I was still crying and feeling frustrated for my inability and everything. Nvm... Anyway, halfway through the dinner, Mel called me. Then there and then everything happened.   I slept at 3 plus 4am on sun morning. Woke up around 8am. Went for make up cgm with Ben cause he had to play for masters and couldn't make it for cgm on sat. We had to stand outside the place for almost 20 mins cause apparently they(the make up cell peepz) couldn't hear the knocking of the door. After that both of us went to meet my family at some dim sum restaurant and on the way there, he made many wrong mistakes and went on the wrong roads. After like what seemed a million years, we finally reached  . The food there is... well, I was just hungry and didn't really concentrate on whether the food was good. But Ben mentioned that he would bring his cousin there one day cause it had all his cousin's favourite dishes. Lunch was $130+ which made up of almost 40 dishes. Horrible us.  After lunch, Ben fetched me home and I rested for 2 hours. Woke up and went to work. Hands are breaking now. At least I earned $30 enough to survive through this week. Really feeling shagged right now. Hands are breaking. Back is hurting. Mind is swirling. Sweet dreams Grace...

      A story of my life; brief account of what happens day to day... Of course, i can't be too transparent in here if not i will definitely offend or hurt some people... Isn't blogging all about this...? - wanting to let people know what you did, who you saw/met, which cute guy/girl you saw blah blah blah... but then careful not to let out too much in case someone hates you for it? Haha! The things human beings do... and sad to say, I'm one of them too.   Anyway, I guess most of my reasons for doing this is because there are just some things/words in my heart that i wish to scream out but obviously can't display in public. Perhaps this is the only place where I can express myself "freely" - to a certain extent of course.  Oh yes! Another reason could be: Some events/incidents which are special/memorable/stupid/hilarious blah blah blah that I might want to jot down so that I can read it again and have a good laugh myself?  I'm not a poet or something so don't expect to find me using 'chim' vocabs or fluent sentences that makes much sense. Just like this.  Think this is about it. Introduction to my life that begins on 8/7/04. Well, not entirely my life cause I'm already a 16 yrs 10 mths and 20 days old 'grown up' girl. =) Cheerios!

      Wow... Today's service was good! Parade of Ministry and Pst. Kong's preaching... I was greatly  impacted by it too~ Yeapz... We should not always worry about every little thing... Why so? Cause... - 40% of our worries never come to past. - 30% of our worries come from the past. - 12% of our worries are health related. - 10% of our worries are petty and over small little details. Thus everyday we only have 8% worries to really worry about. That's like 57.6 mins a day. Which means each day we can only allow an hour of worrying, other than that we should put on our big wide beautiful smile! =D  After service, we went to try out the food and drink stalls on the 4th level. Hmm... though portion abit small but haha... not bad lar.. the drumsticks are nice! Went to fellowship more over at Jurong Point. By the time I reach home, it was almost 7pm. My parents, sis and uncles went to see the fireworks! I didn't go... =(((( Coz initially my friend asked me out for a drink but Mel didn't want to go so I was not interested as well. No more fireworks for me... =(((((((((((((((((((  I'm missing him again... Well, shall just divert my attention over to Ah Pa... ;) Wanna practise my guitar now. Will I be able to fulfill my promise to Mel 2 years back? I doubt so... God~ I need more of your anointing!!!

      Am I really working myself out? I really don't know... My parents told me to stop working. They said what for make myself so tired when I'm getting a $500 allowance monthly. I don't know why I want to work also. Maybe God just gave me this job during this period so that I can work and pay for my mission fund next month...  Okok... I'm shag... Worked from 12 to 6pm today. Maybe cause didn't had enough sleep last night that's why feeling so tired. School will be starting soon. I haven't studied a bit this week, except for meeting up with my groupmates for project. Always feeling so restless... seriously I think I get my parent's idea now.   Ben's away for 3 days already. 17 days to go. Can I make it through?   This week is our church 15th anniversary! But I still haven't got any friends to go yet. Am I such a lousy labourer of God? I think cause I never pray enough for friends... Anyway tomorrow's fasting. So yea... Hope the harvest will really come in by Sunday!

      Firstly, I wanna thank WontdieonE and BOK for your comments! Yeapz... God's love is indeed amazing and everlasting... I learnt in church that most of the time, the devil will try to ruin us by speaking negative thoughts into us... but we have to learn to divert all these unto God's love for us and its all the devil's doings... In this way, we will be able to forgive and forget more easily. Like how God always forgives our sins... ;)  Very tired now... Fell asleep last night while watching tv... =X Tv not switched off, never read bible or talk to God. Sorry Father! Woken up by my maid at 6:15a.m. Then went back to sleep and woke up again at 10:53a.m. Was late for meeting my group mates in school to discuss our project. I really gotta do something about this habitual lateness of mine! It's hindering my spirit of excellence from progressing.  I seriuosly need rest now... My brain is dead...   Mat 11:28-30 "Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."

      I HATE THE devil!!!! HATE him TO THE CORE!!! I SHALL CURSE THE devil AND BIND him SO THAT he WILL GO BACK TO HELL WHERE he BELONGS!!!!  All the irritating people just come all at the same time. One by one adding on to the anger! But I shall not blame it on the flesh but on the devil!!! Purposely don't wanna type capital letters for the devil cause he don't deserve it! God, Jesus, Holy Spirit but not satan! he is just a small ant that I, with God's authority, can trample on! I shall cast him away back to where he belongs, to the place where he suffers... I HATE him! I HATE him! I HATE him!   I need to let out... and this is the only way I can think of to prevent myself from committing any sins or before I murder someone... God~ teach me~ How to handle such situation?? How to deal with satan??   By the way, HAPPY BIRTHDAY SINGAPORE!!   I'm deadbeat but I still need to do research online... How?? My brain is not functioning well already... Can't think... I need my daily bread now...  Isa 27:1  In that day the LORD with His severe sword, great and strong, will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan that twisted serpent; that is in the sea.

      -sigh- Just came home like... 15 mins ago? Real tired now... Ever since I got this new job, which began this week, I'm always feeling exhausted everyday after work so not much chance to come online and update my blog or even time to check my mails... Forgive me if you don't feel updated about my life ya?  Anyway, really wanna thank God today. Well, everything at work was smooth... At least I didn't break any glass or spill any water again. Merely forgotten to bring a few bowls of soup... =X Luckily His angels are holding all the cups for me that's why the cups didn't topple. ;) So sleepy now... Guess that's all for today...   Oh yes! About my test on thu... Hehez by God's grace, I scored 36/50 which is erm... considered not-bad already for someone like me who studied only 4 topics when I'm suppose to cover 6. Give praise to the Lord! Some of my classmates who studied all 6 topics only scored like 30,31,32,33? So I guess my 36 was a bonus yea? Hehez... Tml's cell group... Can't wait to be in God's presence again and fellowship with my beloved cg members~ Love them da most!  To Mel: I have forgiven you yesterday night already. So don't need to be too bothered about me.

      Haiz... woke up today and knew that its not gonna be a smooth day. Forgot to bring matric. card for identification. So I received my first warning letter for not presenting my matric. card. The test wasn't exactly smooth either. Everything's so wrong!!!  Broke a glass cup and accidentally poured water over my manager's pants. Why do such things always happen to me???????? Though he did not scold me, but I felt really really bad... Its only the second day of work~ But really gotta thank God that my manager did not scold and the teacher that he also did not scold me when I told him I forgot to bring my matric. card.   Hopefully today will end well. Hmm... seems like there's nothing now to go wrong about anyway. Nitez!

      I'm having regrets... About everything...  I'm regretting that I gave Mel the cats. Cause she can't spend much time outside now. My initial intention for introducing Mel and Liz the job was hoping that we could all work together. I know we are in different schools now and if nothing is done, our relationships will drift further. So I found this job to be really good cause all of us seem to be able to work. But the end result is we still only get to see each other on fri(s) or sat(s).   I'm regretting that I agreed to the Koh San job. The working environment is not friendly at all. All the staffs constantly seem to be feeling stress. Pressure is strong. It's so hard to even communicate with them.  I'm regretting about my course. TP is too far away. Everyday I'm late for school. The classmates aren't making me feel any better. After all the stress from work and relationships, I have no mood to study at all. Not able to catch up with school work. No one is helping me.   I'm regretting alittle on my relationship with Ben. I treat him 'not-so-good'. He treat me back the way I treat him. Worse part is both of us refuse to tell each other about it. We are having communication breakdown. I don't know. I'm talking it out with him now. Really don't know what will the end result be.  I'm regretting that I did not spend enough time in God's presence. Though I did not glorify Him much, but He is always with me, showing me love and sending people of love to me. I took Him for granted. I know that His patience also has a limit. So before He reaches His limit, I gotta do something about it. I love His people and love Him even more. I will continue to motivate myself and learn to love Him in every way more. Sorry Lord, I love You. Really... I love Your presence, I love the Spiritman You gave to me, I love Jesus...   Hope I'll be back on track soon and everything will be so smooth in my life again. I really need to have a clear view of where I'm going now. I pray... really pray that God will deliver me through this tough time.
