      That's the song for the day, try it out. It's really good...to me, that is.  Something's on my mind lately... Ever got the feeling that you're forgetting to do something, but don't know what it is? That basically describes me right now. I feel like I'm forgetting something, but just cant put my finger on it... Bah...if it's important, it'll come back sooner or later. No need to go all constipated in the head about it.

      Well, I finished most of my business and I'm rather free now, but I don't know why I just feel stressed. Enough about that, it's not important. Oh, for the next few entries, I'll be putting my recommended songs as a title, so if you have the time, just check it out. Most people would know that I'm picky about my music, so you might get some ideas on what songs I like.

      A continuation from my previous entry, I woke up at 8.30am. Almost forgot I had a badminton game and a gym appointment with someone at 10am, but I made it in the end. Actually, I should've just cancelled it, because I think I overworked my right arm and it's still aching right now.  Since I fell asleep early the night before, I had to reschedule and so I needed to finish up my history notes on Sunday. Getting back from my game + gym, my arm hurt a bit and I couldn't write as normal as I usually would. But then, I had to finish the notes, so I just did it. Screw the messy hand-writing, I was already running out of time. Well, that kinda sums everything up...  You know what I think? I'm currently assuming that our surrounding noises actually affect our dreams. This has happened twice to me so far. The first time was when I left the computer on with my Winamp still playing my MP3s. That time, I had some sort of a mixed dream, combining several songs into a scenario which actually turned out rather sad. I cant remember exactly what it was, but I knew at the final part of the dream, I woke up and I immediately saw the similarity between the final part of the dream and the song currently playing. Another occasion, was just quite recent. It was the TV instead of the computer, but the dream I had was closely linked to the sounds that were coming out of the TV. Well, who can understand the subconscious mind? Certainly not me, that's my bit on dreams.

      I've been busy these past few days, but I think everything is clearing up now. Since I have the time, I'm going to talk about yesterday(Saturday, June 26th) first. Well, I had a "gotong-royong" at school and I had to be there by 7.30am. Normal enough, right? For most people, yes. For me, nope. The night before was a Friday night. So, sticking to my usual routine, I went to bed at around 3am since I always sleep late on any given Friday/Saturday night. Back to the story, I slept at 3am and had to wake up at 6.30am to get ready for the "gotong-royong" thingy at school.  Well, I slept for a total of 3 hours and 30 minutes. No big deal, right? It's quite normal, actually. Anyway, the "gotong-royong" was kind of fun and after that, I went home to take a quick shower and get a change of clothes and I was off to watch "Around the World in 80 Days" with some friends. It's a nice movie, worth a look, if you ask me. But I'm a Jackie Chan fan, so I'll be biased and support his movies. =P After the movie, I got back home and for some strange unknown reason, I felt tired. I didn't bother about it at first and went about my usual stuff. Time passed, too quick for my liking, and I fell asleep at 8pm, totally missing dinner. Next thing you know, I woke up at 2am and I went to watch TV until 5am. I was planning to watch "The Sum of All Fears" at 11pm, but I slept through that, so I settled for "The Tuxedo", another Jackie Chan movie, at 3am. After the movie, I went back to sleep at around 5.30am because of over-tiredness-ness-ness. So yeah, that's basically what I did from Saturday 6.30am to Sunday, 5.30am. A perfect waste of time, if you ask me. Remind me not to sleep too much next time, it put me behind schedule. I HAD plans which I was forced to cancel just because I accidentaly fell asleep at 8pm.

      Yes, longest BM essay evar! BUT no, I'm not talking about the length of the essay I wrote. I'm talking about the TIME I took to write the damn thing. I started at 2am on Sunday morning, 20th June 2004. I was stuck and couldn't write anything for 3 hours until 5am. That's when I decided to go to bed in hopes of getting an idea when I wake up. Unfortunately, that was hardly the case. When I woke up, I was still clueless. But somehow, sometime later, inspiration kicked in and I finally finished the BM essay at around 3-4PM.  It's a good thing we get to choose which essay to write in the exam. If not, I'll most likely need another 13 hours to finish whatever you ask me to do.  Oh, remember I mentioned that I bought a cup of coffee on Friday during tuition? It's in my previous post, refer to that. Anyway, I think I "burnt" my tongue on the coffee. I only felt the effect on Saturday, though. I had a weird and irritating feeling on my tongue and when I put toothpaste to cool it off, it will start bleeding in some places. But that's yesterday. Everything is fine now.  And how exactly did I get my tongue "burnt", you ask? Well, usually people would sip their coffee since it's most likely very hot, right? That time, my hand kinda "slipped" and I took in a bigger gulp than what I wanted to. Damn, it was hot...

      I bought another cup of RM5 coffee and brought it back to tuition again. It's fun =P  Anyway, I don't think I've mentioned this before, but there're these new twins in school. Oh, did I mention that many girls are going "OMGOMG!!! There're SO cute!!1111shift+1111" Damn, man. They really need to learn some self control. The idea of gathering around the staircase just to catch a glimpse of them seems kind of...dumb...  But then, to each his/her own. I've said it before, this is just a phase. It'll end sooner or later, but until then, it's their business if they want to make fools of themselves.

      When I got back my history papers. The overall total was a whoopin' 66. Just add an extra 6 at the back, and you'll get "666", The number of the beast, to those Iron Maiden fans. Anyway, no, I'm not proud of 66, but I expected something worse. Hey, I went totally blank on one of the essays and I left out a few structural questions too, so I thought I was going to get maybe something in the 50's. Now all I have to do is worry about my Moral paper. Yeah, I didn't have time to do a 20 mark essay question for MORAL...so sue me...  Hmmm...Russia's going to play against Portugal later in the morning. Well, I'm talking about football/soccer, of course! I'm sure anyone who has known me for at least half a year would know that I'm totally Russian biased. I know, Russia's chances of getting a win here is slim, but I'll continue supporting them anyway. Well, I wont purposely get up at 4am to watch football, I'll watch it if it's earlier. But I'll await hopefully favourable reports in the papers the following day.

      Ok, I can't write much here... I have this headache which is bothering me a lot and I can't think right. No, don't ask me to go take a panadol. I don't believe that something which goes into our digestive system can affect our mind. One more thing, don't try to explain how it works by using some scientific thing, I wont listen. =P  Anyway, first day back to school, can't think of anything to say. It's pretty normal, I guess. I'll go nurse this headache of mine for now...

      Well, I slept at 7am this morning and woke up at about 10am. A total of around 3 hours of sleep! Isn't that cool? I know, I know, it's not really anything great. Let's see...As stated in my previous entry I finished watching the movie at around 3am. After the movies, I read the 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' novel until 7am, and I drank a total of 3 cups of coffee during the period when the first movie started until the time I went to bed.  Anyway, does anyone here believe that each of us has a "twin" somewhere out there? By "twin", I mean someone who resembles us a lot in appearance and vice-versa. Take me for example, most people I know say I look very much like that Chinese basketball player, Yao Ming...did I get the spelling right? Well, people say I look like him a lot except that I'm just shorter. Now, putting me aside, I think I've found the so-called "twin" of two of my other friends. I found somebody who looks almost like one of my friends, Wei Yang. Yea, I met that other dude in my physics/chemistry tuition. Coincidently, there is also a girl in that tuition who also goes to the same BM tuition as me, that resembles Vila, one of my female friends. Only thing is, she's fairer than you, Vila.

      Yes, 5 hours. From 10pm until 3am. Hey, don't look at me like that. I just wanted to make the most of the time remaining until the school holidays ended. And the 3 movies I watched were good too, so it was worthwhile.   Let's see, first I started out with "Route 666" on Cinemax, Astro channel 41. That show is about some FBI dude who had to escort this other dude to this place along with a few other FBI friends. Well, it so happens that they get stranded along Route 66, a deserted road in the middle of the...desert. Oh, it's rumoured to be haunted too. Haunted by what? Well, last time, 4 convicts were shot and kinda buried alive IN the road by some lousy corrupted sheriff dude. Actually, not buried alive...they got rolled over by a steamroller while they were still alive and then buried. But anyway, even in the afterlife, those 4 convicts come back in zombie-like bodies and kill anyone who stays on the road long enough or anyone near the road. Okay, I'm not a good storyteller, so sue me. But it's something like that. =P Wanna know the ending? Watch it yourself, no spoilers here.  The next movie is "The Assignment", also Channel 41 on Astro. It's about this naval officer who resembles some other terrorist dude...A LOT. So some CIA dude gets the naval officer to impersonate that terrorist guy to make it look like the terrorist was double-crossing the KGB so that the KGB can do the dirty work and kill the terrorist guy for them. Did I mention that it was censored? No? Well, it was. I think 2 parts had mild nudity, so the proper thing to do is...cut it. Yea, just remove the whole scene from the movie. Anyway, it's quite good in my opinion, so check it out if anybody wants to.  And the last movie is "The Bourne Identity" on HBO, channel 40. I don't really need to explain, right? Most people would've either read the book or seen the movie already. I wont elaborate on it.  Enough about movies, I was watching my sister play a very old Playstation(NOT PS2)game earlier. God, it brought back many memories...I was small, dumb, naive, etc. back then. Well, I'm not small now, but I wont comment on the dumb part. I'll leave that up to you, the readers, to decide. Back to the topic, I looked at the game and many memories came back. It's always about the "good ol' days", isn't it? In this case, yes, I would say so. I didn't have a worry in the world back then, now, just look all around. We worry about school, grades, projects, our social life, our image, girl problems, boy problems, our finances and all that stuff. But hey, that's life, it's all part of growing up. Learning responsibility, that's what moulds us to become the person we will be in the future.

      Yeah, they charge around RM4.50 for a regular-sized cup of black coffee at San Francisco Coffee. Hell, I could've made myself a cup at home for very much cheaper and faster too... Let me elaborate what happened. I was at my usual Friday physics/chem tuition in Bangsar. It's 3 hours and 45 minutes long, first half we study either physics or chem then we get a 40 minute dinner break. For the second half, we study whatever we didn't do during the first half. So that means, we do chemistry for the second half if we did physics earlier and vice-versa. So, during the break, I didn't follow my friends to go have dinner, but just stayed in class to talk to other friends. Well, suddenly I had a craving for a cup of coffee. So I went out and bought a cup. I could chose from Starbucks, Coffee-Bean or San Francisco Coffee. I took SFC because it was nearest...Well, they're all on the same street, but they're all the same anyway. So right in the middle of tuition I got my caffeine fix. For RM5, I guess it's worth it. Nothing beats bringing a cup of coffee into tuition and taking a sip from time to time! =P  Well, I guess I don't need to have my late-night coffee now. Or maybe just one more cup...later. I'm planning to stay up extra late for tonight, seeing as the school holidays are almost over, I plan to make full use of the remaining time I have. Heh...why does that sentence sound like I'm going to die soon? =P

      The truth? Which is...? ...There is no spoon.  Ok, ok, I'll stop that now. But in relation to the title, I actually did realize something. Well, earlier today, I was playing a strategy game(as usual), and I hesitated to launch an attack. I very well had enough resources, troops and generals and had a high percentage of being successful. So why did I hesitate? From studying this situation, I have come to a conclusion: I am too conservative sometimes. Or maybe it's because of my natural human nature...  Let me elaborate on my first point here. I say I'm too conservative because I'd rather only make a move when I'm sure 100% that I'm going to be successful. In other words, I don't take risks SOMETIMES. Don't get me wrong, I've taken plenty of risks as far as I can remember up until this point of life. Some may be worth it, some may be just plain dumb and I've had an equal amount of the total successes and failures as a result. So I say to myself, should one be more aggressive? Or keep defending until the perfect time comes for one to act? If you ask me, life can be closely linked to what I have just pointed out. We need to make decisions. To either be aggressive and seize what we want as quick as possible, or standby on the defensive to wait for the perfect opportunity...With the risk of having that perfect opportunity just slip pass us if we wait too long. This fact applies to our everyday life, whether it be about girl/boy issues, business, politics, etc.  Now, onto my second point, the "natural human nature" I mentioned earlier. In that particular situation, I refused to act. Why? Because I take into consideration that I might be sacrificing lives for a worthless cause. Oh, sure, I know it's just a game, but I still don't like seeing too many of the people who support my actions die. Funny thing is, I still feel pity for them even though it's a game and they are not real. That may seem kinda soft of me, but if killing was made legal right now, I would gladly go and hunt down many people who I don't like. I won't list them down, it's personal.

      Well, earlier today, I was walking down the road. Seems normal enough, no? Yes, that's normal. Well then, I walked pass a parked car and I could've sworn that I saw something inside...No, I'm not talking about the seats, steering wheel, radio, etc. I was quite sure I saw 2 people inside and they acted as if they were arguing about something. They were flailing their arms around and stuff from what I could see. But when I looked again 5 second laters, the car was empty. Funny thing is, this happened twice today. Maybe it's just the light from the sun, but it seems pretty interesting to me, it cant happen twice in a row, right?  It makes you think...Our minds are complicated, but yet simple at the same time. I quote a line from one of my favourite tv shows: " The one with the biggest brain always has a way out. A tiny door marked 'exit' "  Now, this quote can be true in most cases. The smarter person will almost always have a plan to get through whatever they face. BUT, what if they are on the opposite side of the chess board against someone smarter or craftier?  This next quote is in reply to the previous one. It goes:  "Well, it's time you start running for it."   But even if they do run for the "exit", where will they end up? That's life for you. Nobody knows what will happen in the future. So you see, even the smartest person will eventually get trapped. Like a rat in a maze, every turn leads to another wall in its path.

      I tell you guys, it's never been like this before. Yes, I like coffee before this, but I don't get addicted to it. Now I'm totally hooked on it. Funny this is, I like my coffee late at night...don't ask me why, I just do.  Anyway, I've been reading a lot these past few days. That 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' novel really gets you hooked. It's actually the history of China and tells of the epic of the Han Dynasty during the 2nd and 3rd century. There are 120 chapters and it's about 1100 - 1700 pages long depending on the font and paper size. If anyone's interested, I'd suggest you give it a try. Hell, it even helped me on my English essay during the mid-term exam. I wrote about one of the battles in the book for the essay I picked which is a story about "Cooperation brings success" or something like that. It really saved me a lot of trouble since I didn't need to think much. It was all in my head.  Today? Well, nothing special. Just the usual school holiday routine. Wake up and just stare at the TV or computer screen the whole day. There, that should be a good start to the new blog. I have more to tell, check back sometime soon. =P

      Okay, this afternoon, I was watching this old P. Ramlee movie on Astro Ria with my dad. Hey, don't ask me why, it just so happens that I accidentaly pressed the '4' button on the control. Being a black & white movie, it doesn't sound very appealing, does it? I found it rather amusing, actually. First of all, there are some comedy aspects in the movie, but it's not really funny. The fun part is when me and my dad crack lame jokes about the scenes in the movie. It's hard to describe, only the people who were there knew how it was like. =P  I'll admit one thing, though. The story is quite good. It's about a teacher who falls for this woman in a bus. He gets to know her and they start going out. Well, back in those days, the term "going out" is best pictured as going to the zoo and singing songs...because that's exactly what they did. Neither of them know that they are actually NEIGHBOURS who argue A LOT. You see, the guy always shouts at his neighbour(the woman) and he finds her annoying, but they have never actually seen each other's faces. Unknowingly, they hook up. I say the story is nice because it makes you sit down and see what's going to happen next. I myself was anxious to know what will happen when he finds out that she was actually the neighbour he had been shouting at and arguing with all this time. When they find out the truth, they just laugh and decide to get maried. I missed the part after that because I had to go out for dinner. So, don't underestimate olden black & white Malay movies. Don't knock it till you've tried it =P  This reminds me. I'll type down a few of the latest movie endings, SPOILERS!!! : Shrek 2 - Shrek dies in the end Spider-man 2 - He dies in the end Harry Potter - Harry dies in the end too KING ARTHUR - Yup, you guessed it. Arthur dies in the end. - I realize that the movie is not released yet, but trust me. I can predict endings. XD  Just to prove I can predict endings : I, Robot - The character Will Smith plays dies in the end =P  Notice a pattern? Hehe...

      So, did anyone watch the new series, "John Doe"? As far as geniuses go, I still prefer Jarod from the show "The Pretender". Basically, John is more like a super-smart civilian who helps out the cops. I say CIVILIAN because he has that innocent look of his.  On the other hand, Jarod might lose out to John on the smart factor, but Jarod's 'style' is much cooler. For instance, when Jarod talks on the phone, he'll usually leave a riddle/message and then just hang up before the other person gets a chance to reply. Wouldn't we all want to do that? =P  So far, there's only been 1 episode of 'John Doe', so I cant comment much. I'm looking forward to further episodes. But I dare say that nobody can match Jarod's way of catching criminals, though. =P

      Yay, I just finished the last of my BM rumusan work! Time for an update.  I was watching a movie earlier and I wanted something to drink. So I thought to myself "Hey, a cup of coffee would be nice!" and I proceeded to make one. Half-way through making it, I thought "Hey, something different would be nice!", so I reached out for the nearest thing and put it into the coffee too. What was it? The Milo milk powder. Turns out, the mixture is pretty good, but I think I put a bit too much of the Milo powder because I cant really taste the coffee. I know I'm not the first to do that, but it's still worth a mention. =P  Anyway, about the movie I was watching, it was about these three guys who dressed up as girls for something that I wont elaborate on. My question is, "Why do the people in the movie have to ACT dumb and think that they're really girls?". Just look at their shaven faces and you'll instantly tell that they're guys, we need to be more realistic in this department. Men wouldn't pass for girls that easily just by wearing a wig, putting on fake breasts and some make-up. But nonetheless, the movie was amusing. I think I'll go check what else is on TV right now...

      Well, I was doing my personal accounts just yesterday and it turns out my balance from last month is RM81.81. I'm only counting the ammount I have in my wallet, not the overall thing...I'm too lazy for that. Just thought that RM81.81 is a nice coincidence...ok, I have 1 cent in my wallet...so sue me.  Anyway, don't you just hate know-it-alls? There's a girl in my physics + chem tuition, she's nice when talking about normal things, kinda pretty too, but she goes into "know-it-all" mode whenever a question is asked. It can get pretty annoying after a while, I think it's only me, though. No one else seems to bother. No, I don't hate her, I actually kind of like her, but it sometimes gets annoying. Maybe I'm just jealous, or maybe not... I guess I'll just ignore it.
