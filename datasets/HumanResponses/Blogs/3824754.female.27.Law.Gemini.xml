      Well, the title says it all. I'm leaving work early today. Maybe I'll go out to the links? Or catch a flick? Or I can just lay on the beach and dream I won the MegaMillions lottery? Yeah, that's it.  &nbsp; Regardless, I'm getting out of here. Ciao!

      I went shopping for some nice lingerie today. Victoria Secrets, one of my favorite stores, had a sale.&nbsp; So I had to pick up a bag full of goodies. I'm adding an irrestible little black mesh&nbsp;slip and a pink silk and black lace teddy to my collection.  &nbsp; I stopped at Marshall Fields on the way out of the mall to see if their sale was as good as advertised. However, I was traumatized while shopping there. One simple rule in selling sexy lingerie: Never place the lingerie section directly across from the baby clothes. I looked at a red lace teddy and admired it for a second before pulling it off the rack. Then I looked up, and staring back at me was a whole row of pastel "onesies." Red lace teddy... Newborn baby clothes.... Ahhhhh. Needless to say, I placed the lingerie back on the rack and quickly exited the building. I'll have nightmares tonight about durability inspectors at the Trojan factory sleeping on the job.  &nbsp; -K

      I love TLC's show "What Not To Wear."&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept&nbsp;is&nbsp;hilarious.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;identify&nbsp;one of your friends or relatives as the most fashion-inept person on the face of the earth, and then you have that person secretly filmed over the course of a week or two.&nbsp; Why? So you can show the entire nation just how horrible that person looks.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then the set up goes to another level.&nbsp; You invite your friend/relative to a fictitious gathering so that the "What&nbsp;Not To Wear" cast can publicly humiliate him/her.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cast makes sure the friend/relative knows just how ridiculous his/her&nbsp;appearance really is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just when&nbsp;all&nbsp;of that person's dignity and&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;are gone, you have two&nbsp;fashion experts give&nbsp;that friend/relative&nbsp; some&nbsp; fashion advice and free clothes. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Boy!&nbsp; What would you do if someone nominated you for "What Not To Wear?"&nbsp; S**t, if you were really a friend, it seems like&nbsp;you could spare me the televised drama and public humiliation, and just tell me to my face that I have&nbsp;a problem with style.&nbsp; Even if it's a serious, never go to the store unsupervised or else the fashion police will chase you down with&nbsp;German Shepards&nbsp;until you come to your senses and promise to burn your entire&nbsp;wardrobe problem.&nbsp; Now, if I don't listen after a courtesy intervention, feel free to nominate me for any show you like.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just need a safe harbor provision, a "get out of jail free card."&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nevertheless, I can think of a few people I would like to nominate.&nbsp; Like my uncle whose&nbsp;idea of perfect picnic&nbsp;gear is a rayon shirt with the first&nbsp;3 buttons undone, so you can have the privilege/horror of seeing his chest hair; a belt the size of a weight-lifting safety belt; really casual/bummy shorts; dress socks that come up to the knee; and perfectly shined black dress shoes.&nbsp; Oh, did I mention he's still rockin' a jheri curl that he'd like people to believe is naturally curly hair.&nbsp; And I almost forgot to mention his jheri curl is really long, like mid-way down the back long.&nbsp; Oh yeah, he wears a Mr. T starting kit too, as if he walked into the pawn shop and said, "How many gold&nbsp;chains&nbsp;and rings can I buy for $100? Gimme the cheapest stuff ya got that won't turn green."&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hmm, yeeeaaah (in my best "Office Space" voice.).&nbsp; Ok, so maybe some people need shock treatment.&nbsp; Forget everything I said in paragraph 3; I changed my mind.&nbsp; I'm all for surprise public humiliation.... as long as it's not me. -K

      I’m only twenty-six But some think I’m in dire need of a relationship Reminding me of my biological clock And as they speak I hear a resounding tick tock Is my situation so desperate? I thought I had plenty of time yet Should I take out an ad in the Detroit Free Press? Letting men know about my sexual prowess: “Young and successful Intelligent and beautiful I am all of these and more Woman seeking man  With healthy sperm Call this number to score.”

      &nbsp;I've been pretty down lately, but sad times don't last always. "Weeping may endure for the night, but joy cometh in the morning light." I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, which is great.&nbsp;&nbsp; My family's been really supportive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have a romantic/fun/adventurous weekend planned that I'm really excited about.  &nbsp; I recently got tickets to the Prince concert, which makes me really happy!  &nbsp; Other than that, it's just hot. I mean muggy, humid, just want to sit on the couch naked with the fan pointed at me and drink ice cold water out of a gallon jug hot. &nbsp;Man. &nbsp;Note to self: never rent anything that doesn't have air conditioning.&nbsp; That includes cars and apartments.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Speaking of hot, I would really like to move to southern California when I'm done with Law School. San Diego, to be exact. I hear San Diego has perfect weather all year long. But until then I'll just imagine Lake Michigan is the ocean.

      How to spin the truth....  &nbsp;  "Your honor, my client is a respectable member of the community.&nbsp; His grandmother is very ill right now.&nbsp; Just before the incident in question, he visited his grandmother while sick in the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Four words, your honor.&nbsp; She only said to him four words.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Son, please help me."&nbsp; And that's exactly what he tried to do.&nbsp; When he was caught with 500 kilos of cocaine, he was merely trying to raise enough money to pay for his grandmother's treatment.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; He loves his grandmother dearly and would do anything that he felt wasn't going to inflict direct harm on another person in order to help his grandmother.&nbsp; Your honor, he was only thinking of his 80-year old nana.&nbsp; He deserves another chance."

      Well, actually I didn't see any lions or tigers... or bears for that matter, but I did go to the zoo.&nbsp; I got a chance to check out the snow leopards, cheetahs, red pandas, monkeys (and apes), and wolves.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I even got a chance to feed and pet the giraffes, which was great.&nbsp; Their tongues are huge!&nbsp; They were almost like a really passive dog, just galloped (as opposed to ran) over to you, put their heads up near your hand, and then grabbed the giraffe-cracker from my hand with his/her tongue.&nbsp; Neat, huh?  &nbsp;  I went canoeing this weekend!&nbsp; Oh my goodness, did I have a good time.&nbsp; We drank a few "Mike's" and canoed three miles.&nbsp; At first my partner, who was sitting in the back of the canoe, had to get the rust off of her canoeing skills.&nbsp; She almost decapitated me a few time steering us under bushes.&nbsp; Once the rust was off, we were ready for all the obstacles the river had to offer.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, that's all for tonight folks.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Adios.&nbsp; Hasta Luego.&nbsp; Bien Venidos!&nbsp; Ciao!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  -K

      Pres. Bush is here in the Grrr. I got in the elevator with one of my co-workers and she just let out a loud sigh. "There are too may people downtown today," she said. She looked at me and continued, "People going the wrong way on one-way streets. I swear, that man attracts every idiot in the county."  Amen.  I'll admit, I supported Bush in the beginning, but my support has dwindled to the size of a subatomic particle. I was never a Republican. I'm socially liberal and fiscally conservative, so his proposed policy worked for me in 2000. However, in 2004 it's a different story.  I think the War on Iraq did it for me, but it was only the straw that broke the camel's back. No pun intended. His handling of our economic downturn, our unfinished business in Afghanistan, and the freaking Patriot Act were all factors that prompted my shift from Bush-backing to Bush-bashing. The War in Iraq merely provided the fatal blow, and the Fahrenheit 911 nailed the coffin shut.  Funny, there are lot of people like me. I work with a guy who worked on Bush's campaign in the first election. The first time around he met Dub-ya and helped him get elected. Four years later, he hates to even admit that he's a republican. "Anybody but Bush" is his current philosophy.  Well, I'm going to leave here a little early to avoid the "idiots." John Kerry will be here on Monday, and I can't wait for that. His speech last night was amazing.

      Well, I don't know about "love," per se, but I am in a wonderful relationship.&nbsp; It's really cool, because I haven't met anyone like this in a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, if you know anything about me, I'm so anti-love.&nbsp; Until recently, that is.&nbsp; I won't say that I've fallen in love or anything, but I'm a helluva lot more willing to do so now.&nbsp;   A friend in college once told me, "Kimberly, one day love will bite you on the butt and you won't know what to do."&nbsp; Well, dammit.&nbsp; My butt hurts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still resisting, but eventually I may throw my hands in the air and just give in.&nbsp;   And what's up with this?&nbsp; I always fall for guys whose names start with the letter "D."&nbsp; If your first or middle name starts with a "D," your chances are pretty doggone good.&nbsp; If not, you're at a significant disadvantage.&nbsp;

      I met my co-worker's girlfriend and her last name is Balseizer.&nbsp; Yeah, that's pronounced Ball-sizer.&nbsp; Let's just say I had to keep my mind on starving Rwandan children to keep from laughing in her face.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if that wasn't bad enough.&nbsp; Her grandfather's name is Richard.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Ladies and Gentlemen.... Dick Balseizer.

      Shopping in Michigan City.&nbsp; Burberrys, Coach, Ettienne Alger, and much, much more.   So, I dropped a&nbsp;few hundred in Indiana today, I deserve it.&nbsp; I bought some boots for the fall, a skirt, some luggage, a book, some shirts, and ice cream!&nbsp; Well, what's a wonderful summer day without ice cream.&nbsp;   We also stopped by Sawgatuck, MI on the way home.&nbsp; That is such a great beach town for the wealthy.&nbsp; Great shops, tons of water, more Mercedes and Lexus than a dealership, and ice cream.&nbsp; Stopped in a store to check out some gear.&nbsp; We thought we were done clothes shopping, but the Gucci sign caught my eye.&nbsp; The Chequer provided dinner and a drink.&nbsp;   Other than that, life is great.&nbsp;   This weekend I venture off to the cabin in Indiana.&nbsp; I nice romantic weekend in the woods!&nbsp; Nothing better than a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered starberries and a jacuzzi.

      Friday was my last day at work and it was pretty eventful.  Did my last "free" happy hour for a while at the Anchor Bar. Got a $30 parking ticket. My battery died. Got a jump, drove around, and then... the battery died again. Got a lift to a partner's house.  Had drinks in his 3,500 sq ft home on the lake. Took the 25' boat out at midnight, and cruised the lake for a while. Listened to jazz in the partner's great room.   Oh my... the house gave me something to aspire to.

      Man, I'll miss Mr. James.  I remember singing Fire and Desire with Jerry Downing and Rodney (forgot that brotha's last name) in Math 115 (Calc) at the U of Michigan.  Right after our 95' rendition of Rick's masterpiece, I ran right out and purchased the Best of Rick James and Friends (e.g. the Mary Jane Girls, Teena Marie, etc.) from Tower Records.  And folks laughed at me....  He was the man in the 70's, the 90's, and until death.  R.I.P. Rick James  Unity!

      Being romantic is simply listening and responding to what you hear. It can be as simple as gazing into another's eyes or as elaborately planned as trips to Venice. Regardless of whether one chooses the simplistic or the complex end of the romantic spectrum, romance is the flint that lights the fire called love, and the flame keeps the fire burning continuously.  Romance is simply listening to me to find out what I like. Trips to far off places don't mean a damn, if you're merely trying to impress me with money, and simplicity is merely frugality when its a means to date me cheaply. There are some days when hot cup of cocoa is just as romantic as sparing no expense on my wildest extravagance. Romance does not correlate with finances, but hopes, dreams, and desires, all of which are free.  Relationships are like high risk investments and romance is an investment performance report. Is the forecast favorable, or depressing? If things aren't quite what you desire, is your investment worth hanging onto because you know it'll rebound in the future? Every stock, whether a penny stock or a blue chip, has its ups and downs. Despite the hassle, some uncertainty and fluctuation is necessary to achieve great gains in the future.

      The Sunday Night Sex Show is the best -- even though it comes on at midnight on weekdays on the Oh! Oxygen channel.   This 70+ year old chic is hilarious.   I love to hear her talk about sex. She knows her stuff... no pun intended.

      Just when I think I have this whole thing called life figured out, my comfortable existence is picked up and tossed around like Dorthy's crib in a Kansas Twister. And just when I think the whirlwind is over, I travel down a path that, on the surface appears to be the land of milk and honey, the answer to all of my problems, but in reality the path only leads to disappointment. That sucks.

      I had a really great weekend. Actually, it was a weekend many women would die to have.  Friday Dinner, candlelight, a roaring fire in the fireplace, a bottle of white wine, and playing those games that lovers play all night long.  Saturday An intimate breakfast on the porch: eggs, bacon, English muffins, and tons of kisses. Dairy Queen and kite flying for lunch. [Side note: I rule in the kite flying skills.] Intimate intermissions including strawberries dipped in special bitter sweet chocolate obtained from a chocolatier and Veuve Clicquot-Postsardin Champagne. Stories that'll make your toes curl. Dinner and caramel apple martinis in the jacuzzi. Dessert in the jacuzzi. Spending the next 3 hours in the jacuzzi.  Sunday Awwww..... gotta go home, but I got tickets to the Prince concert (row 7). I can see the man's facial expressions! I'm soo in heaven!

      I have a chronic pain in my neck.  It's gotten so bad that whenever I sit, my collarbone, neck and shoulder blades ache.  I thought I may have a pinched nerve, but my mother claims I have some octogenarian ailment like arthritis or bursitis.  OK, whatever.   First of all, arthritis is an ache in your joints.  I ache in the entire shoulder area... not in my joints.  And bursitis... well, dammit, I'm just being stubborn on that one.  It just sounds old.   All I know is, in about a week, if I don't get this taken care of, I'll start looking like Ben Stiller in Zoolander.

      That is D's description of me.  He was trying to pinpoint my style, and that's what he came up with. Essentially I've got this "funky librarian" style. Well, I guess that's a classic style with an urban flare. And because the things I buy -- e.g., Stuart Weitzman shoes -- are not necessarily within a librarian's budget, I'm the Funky Rich Librarian. Moreover, the average librarian doesn't show off the tan lines, so I'm the sexy funky rich librarian.  Tada! That's me.

      OK, I'm getting ready for my Fantasy Football league and then I read this.  I thought it was real, but I guess I was fooled.  Funny stuff fellas... funny stuff.  Holmes Injures Groin Aug. 11, 2004 Brian KelleyThunder Lips  Priest Holmes out at least 14-16 weeks with an odd groin injury. (AP)  The Kansas City Chiefs confirmed today that Priest had injured his groin today during a workout with the team. Apparently his 'manhood' became erect, planted into the ground causing him to twist his legs to contort in a bizarre way. Tony Gonzalas witnessed the play and had this comment "It looked REALLY painful, but I have to admit that I was aroused." This will really hurt Priest fantasy value, as the team is not expecting him back until week 15-17

      Man, this is such a great movie. I got a chance to see it for the first time this weekend. Prior to the Kill Bill movies, I was not a Quentin Tarantino fan.  I know some of you are screaming right now, "HOW CAN SHE NOT LIKE TARANTINO?!" Well, I guess I'm the single person on this earth that can't stand Pulp Fiction.  Anyway, I digress.   I really digged these movies, both Volume I and II.   I love Old School kung fu flicks and these movies were right up my alley.  Revenge, blood, amazing gravity defying moves, etc. I loved it! I've been quoting it for the last two days.  Now that's a good flick.  If you haven't seen it, pick it up. Wal-Mart has it for $15.99.  -K

      Yeah, I know... it makes no sense.  Technically, I grew up in the city, but my father instilled in me every bit of North Carolina country-ness he has in his body.  We had a large garden in the back yard, fruit trees, and hunting dogs.  I used to fish with my dad before I could hold a pole by myself.  I even went squirrel hunting with my dad as a child ...  now if you had any doubts, squirrel hunting alone should sway you to my side.   This weekend, I went fishing and caught a bluegill and a small mouth bass.  I also picked a bushel of green beans from the garden.   But more importantly, I walked barefoot through the yard and while fishing.   In the words of my brother, "I just love to be barefoot.  I'll sit barefoot on the porch."   Barefootedness is the litmus test which determines how country someone is.  How often does someone walk barefoot?  If the answer is 5-7 times a week, including times spent outdoors, then the person is a country boy/girl.   My country-ness used to embarrass me, because it was unexpected for most.  I remember the first time I discovered I was country.  I was sitting in the cafeteria at Michigan, and some friends waved at me from across the room.  I responded, "Hi you!," which in proper english, it's "How are you?"  Since then I've learned to accept my country-ness and love it!
