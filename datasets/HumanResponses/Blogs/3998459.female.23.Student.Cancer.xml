						   Oh, I am stoked! I bought a ticket to go a visit Maggie! YEA! I was really bummed, I really didn't think I'd get to see her this summer, but I WILL! I'm really excited to go and see her.  Summer school has started and Bob, the drummer/co-writer/backing vocals for my band,  urlLink Stericks , and three more of my good friends are all going to be at my college's research facility, which is located right by my home! It's great, I have stuff to do on the weekends! They are crazy busy during the week, they are taking a years worth of class in three weeks or some ungodly deal like that.  Anyway, summer is ok, it's so much better than last year. So I'm grateful.  I miss everyone who I can't see. You all mean a lot to me!

						   Alright, so the weekend happened. Saturday, my family had to go to this picnic at a local state park. It was good to see a bunch of people I haven't seen in a long time. I got a chance to kind of show off my portfolio. Good for me.  Maggie and I talked a bit, not a whole lot, she had a party Saturday afternoon. Got lots of graduation money, that's always good. She then took off to her internship, so we talked a bit on Sunday in between flights  Father's Day was just bad. We all woke up feeling like it was going to be a bad day. Maybe a self-fulfilling prophesy. Dad was just grouchy all day, and when my sister tried to talk to him about his gift he just kind of blew her off. Really made us want to get him something, oh well, seems to happened on "special days". There's something about the pressure to happy that makes everyone edgy. It's too bad. It'll get better.  Well, I'd better get back to work. Hope all ya'll who read this have a great day!

						   I'm sitting here in the Anacortes Starbucks. Thanks to the guys at Garnet Web, I get Wi-Fi here. I'm on a bit of a break before work. It's nice here, probably somewhere around 80. Seems just about right after being in Walla Walla. Oh, well, whatever.  I talked to Maggie this morning, she's returning a bracelet she got for graduation from her parents. It's REALLY nice, but she doesn't really wear bracelets and she wants to have something she'll wear a lot. She's looking at rings and necklaces. The bracelet is either white gold or platinum (I didn't find out for sure), and had like .9 carets of diamonds, so it wasn't cheap... Lucky girl.  Well, that's about it for now. Yoga wasn't so great this morning. I think I'll keep looking, maybe I'll end up getting a video and do it at home, we'll see.  Well, have a good one!

						   I have, by far, the coolest girlfriend, ever!   Maggie and I and the way to Jimmy Buffet  Her dad got tickets to see Jimmy Buffet, and she talked him into getting me a ticket. It was SO much fun! He's the king of hedonism. The parking lot was the biggest tailgate party buffet I've ever seen. It was ten acers of kiddie-pools filled with hard liquer, wet T-Shirt contests, jello shots, pirate flags, shark decorated minivans, and so many CRAZY things! Some people hauled in a full tiki bar and like a 20 foot square patch of sand! I could not believe how many people were fans.    As you can see, Jimmy has a Taquila named after one of his songs...  Maggie and I danced and sang the bits of songs we knew, got covered in dancing drunk fan's beer, and smelled "the weed" a lot. I could NEVER live like that , but it's kind of fun to visit it once and a while a get perspective, or maybe I just secretly want to be a pirate... ARRRRRR! *Swash, swash, buckle, buckle*  Anyway, talk to ya'll later...

						   Well, it's been a while since I've posted, but I guess there are adages for that, huh? Anyway, I found a really good price for a flight back to Illinois, so I jumped on it, and now I sit, in pre-flight, waiting for the gates to open and allow the flood of really unhappy travelers to surge down  the poorly decorated, tan hall way, and burst through the the cabin door, to be greeted by a southern stewardess named Sandy.  "Hi-ah, waly-cuhm to flaht number tew say-van fowr. Nown stahp sur-vi-ehs to Chic-ah-gow Meed-wahee. Thu cri-oo woooood lahk to thang-k yoo fowr flah-yin Ayee Tu-ee Ayee Ehr-lahns! Nahw, in-joe-y the flaht noahw, ya heer?"  Some how, the thought of putting my life in this women's hands is scary,  somehow comforting, but not reassuring in anyway. Although, the thought of her perky self fly the plane is almost better than a pilot so sleep deprived he can't remember he's flow from Orlando to Las Vegas to Portland and hopped a commuter to Seattle.  I guess I'm just ranting now. But, seriously, we go through like five hours of security checks only to find out the planes are pretty much flying themselves.  Here's an annoying side note: I go into a Starbucks that is conveniently located at the exit of security, and get a Black Tea Lemonade. I ask the guy if they have a T-Mobile Hotspot, and he says no, bummer for me. But, he says, he knows that this corridor has wireless internet! Great, I say, and I thank him. I get my drink, and find a seat by a plug in. I start up my computer and wait for it to boot. It does. But, lo and behold, no Wi-Fi service, at least my computer doesn't think so. So I check it's settings, and MY COMPUTER LIED! There it is: ERAIR. So I click on it, and it asks for a password. Well, suffice to say it's evidentially an internal work wireless, 'cause I CAN'T GET ON IT! Kind of bothered me. So, now I'm typing this in NotePad and saving it so upload later. I'm also not getting any work done, which in all actuality has nothing to do with there being no Wi-Fi and more to do with me being lazy. Wireless internet tends not to help laziness. Therefore, I'm perturbed.  I saw The Terminal with Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, about a week ago, and if you've seen it you know that on of Tom Hank's character's friends is an Indian Custodial worker. He kind of walks hunkered over and likes to watch people ignore the "Wet Floor" signs. Well, as I'm sitting here a custodial worker for SeaTac walked by pushing the exact same cart, and walking in the exact same hunkered way! If the guy in The Terminal was working at SeaTac and not JFK, and if he was of European decent and not Indian, that would have been him. Fun for me, none for the people who didn't see the movie.  There's a play set and the end of this seating area. You know like the ones that came out in the late 80's/early 90's. They're blue and green, with a red slide, and they look like they're inflatable, but really they are made of hard plastic. They are reminiscent of fantasy cottages. Anyway, it's just sitting there at the end of the alcove that houses a couple of gates, A4 and 5, I think. Kids are crawling all over it, but it seems so out of place. They should be in a backyard, with a tall wooden fence, and have a grass floor, not a carpeted one. I think I may be becoming WAY too picky, but honestly, who puts a other yard accessories in an airport? You don't see garden hoses, and plastic Flamingos, and mailboxes! Not to mention the lack of that tall wooden fence. I think that's fairly definitive. Yes? No? Maybe?  Well, I suppose I should wrap this up, I'm supposed to board in fifteen minutes and my plane doesn't seem to be here. That's cause for concern. Maybe it's on the other side... Maybe it's been delayed... MAYBE I'M AT THE WRONG GATE! That's not good. All this negative thinking has got my all mixed up.  So, one last thought to leave you with. Do you ever feel like, when you're inline to board the plane, and even though you have an assigned seat, and you are guaranteed that seat, it says so on the ticket, that you will get to the front of the line and the lady will go, "I'm sorry, planes full." And then pull the little tube-like gate thingy closed infront of you? I do, and it it keeps me up at nights!  Well, the plane showed up, good for it. I guess I'll write sometime else. I'm good like that.

						   Saturday was a very good day! I was at a Leadership Conference for the first part of the day, really encouraging, I needed it! Anyway, yea for me.   Lauren and Seth were just one of those couples that everyone expected to get together, they were really close friends all through Middle School and High School, but they never dated each other. They dated others, but no one ever really fit. They finally got together last summer. It was SO special to see them together, they were very obviously in love, but you didn't feel uncomfortable around them.  Lauren and I graduated togther, played in our Christian High School's worship band together, and were pretty close friends. We had a mutual friend that we were both close too, and so it was just natural for us to be friends. She's a great person, I have HUGE amount of respect for her. OH, and she also got me a job at a fruit stand one summer when I couldn't find a job. I ended up getting fired from the job, but she didn't have anything to do with that (I don't think).  Seth is an AMAZING drummer! We, too, played in the worship band together, but we really got to know each other just because the two of us are crazy, and we have a blast with each other. He plays drums in the band  urlLink Mindhead , along with another high school friend of mine, and I've become friends with them through that as well.  Ironically, of all the people I knew and were friends in high school, Lauren and Seth are ususally two of only a small handful I'm still sort of close to. They are truely good friends!  Seth Fikkert and Lauren Burr were married at sometime just after Seven Post Meridiem, August Fourteenth, Two Thousand Four in the Year of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.    Seth and Lauren at their reception  I wish these two an amazing life together, they are good people and it was so awesome to see them together! Conrgrats guys!

						   Well, the summer hits just keep on coming! My dad and I went and saw the Village People and KC and the Sunshine Band! It was SO much fun. Very surreal for me, but kind of oddly reminicent for him. I guess that I have this really romanic view of the 1970's. I keep assuming that the songs I hear on the radio and in movies was what everybody listened to. I just assume that there was one type of music. People had their preferences, but basically you either listened the radio or you didn't. Well, evidentally, that's not the case. My dad was NOT into Disco at all, and come to find out, it would be like being into Pop music today. KC even compared himself to 'Nsync, saying that he was my generation's mom's Justin Timberlake. It was really enlightening.  I really felt odd, in that I never expected to see any of these people, they are out of another world, a past society that can't be accessed any more.  The Village People were SO ... the Village People! They didn't disappoint at all, nor did they exceed expectations. Just right. The guys were all the original line up, minus the Motorcycle guy (he quit in the 80's and the picked up a new guy).   The Village People Preforming  The Village People also informed everyone that most of the US has been doing the YMCA wrong. so they had this whole tutorial. It was REALLY funny! Well, I'm doing my part and spreading the word, here you go,  urlLink click here  for an animated tutorial.  It was SO much fun, my only regret was that Maggie couldn't be there. My dad isn't the best dancer in the world, and it was just better to sit and watch.

						   Alright, I've started this post like three times, I've uploaded the photo and then ... I space out! Anyway, I'm going to follow through this time.  OK, so I know I left IL like three weeks ago, and I should have posted this like the day after it happened but, I didn't. So, deal.  As far as show value Jimmy Buffet wins hands down, but for venue: K.D. Lang at Ravinia Park. The place is AMAZING! Ravinia Park is, as it sounds, a park, except it's built around a large ampatheater. Also, adding to the unique quainess to the show, is that people treat going to a concert at Ravinia like a day at Ascot. Crowds show up in droves hours early, so that they can setup their elaborate picknics. People actually bring candelabra and table cloth-covered wagons come table and fine wines and foods and, coolest of all, some even bring chandelars to through over the baughs of the trees. It's an amazing experience!    I didn't get a great shot of the stage or the park (I'm a smart cookie), so here's a cute one of Maggie and I!  Maggie, her friends Aaron and Etson, and I went to the show together. We brought goat cheese and water crackers, stuff for sandiches, a very good Brie-wrapped-with-pastry-sheets-and-brown-sugar-thing that Maggie made, some non-acoholic Cabernet Sauvignon (long story, but someone won't be celebrating anytime soon), and I don't know what all, oh yeah, grapes, really good green grapes. Etson ate most of them...  After we ate and listened to the concert for a while, Maggie and I decided to walk around and look at all the scenery. Aaron was studying for something so we left him and Etson, who was still eating, to their own devices.    Aaron studying at Ravinia...  We walked among the gay and lesbian couples, K.D. Lang is a fairly proud lesbian, so political as well as musical supporters came to the show, looking at all the really well decorated tables surrounded entirly by men. Lesbians lose points for decor, sorry, but it's true. Anyway, we walked through the park and it was the most amazing movie moment of my life so far. Ms. Lang was singing a Tony Bennett cover, the sun was about to set, and the twinkle lights in the trees were on. Maggie and I danced under a very large shade tree, and it was REALLY romantic.  Anyway, we had a great time!
