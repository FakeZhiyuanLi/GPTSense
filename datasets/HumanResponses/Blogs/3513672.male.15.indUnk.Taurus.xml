      hmm... ive had better days... this morn i almost forgot to wake up completely for skool...my auntie almost told my sis to leave home without me.... so yeah..had to rush out of bed awful quick...  got to skool a lil late... but no worries there... then remembered dat we had a bio test in the morn... yeah... did sum very quick last minute revision... and i dont think i did too badly... but nobody likes tests... after dat was pshe...didnt do anythin... lester theo and me played 3-man tic-tac-toe...we let theo win...cos it was his bday... so yeah...  HAPPY BDAY THEO!!!...=D...many best wishes for the year ahead    played ball...then had german... had to print my coursework... which took forever to do cos the skools internet is so incredibly slow at the current moment... sat nxt to samira who spent the whole lesson goin aight... she wrote i love trees on my hand... great eh?!... after dat was rounders... was a nice game... until it got slightly too competitive...and samira and deepak started arguin etc etc... yeah... well i guess...its nice to see ppl take their sport seriously...  played bball at lunch... by this time of the day i really didnt feel like ballin at all... so yeah... i didnt bother runnin etc etc... had a lil accident and charlie got his eye cut when kelvin elbowed him... but accidents do happen in bball... they happen all the time....charlie came bak... and then kinda landed on me when he jumped... his weight and mine landed on my bad ankle... which wasnt good... walked funny after dat...  end of the day was physics... we got our coursework bak...and guess wat...lester and me got called up cos a bit of our coursework looked very similar... i.e. he was accusin us of copyin and cheatin... dats the second time its happened to me this week... i was not a very happy person... and neither was lester... to top my day off... may started writin on all my stuff...and toby ran his mouth off again... personal warnin to u toby... i may not have the capabilities of beatin u up so i prob wont do anythin... but i suggest u dont keep talkin crap to lester or anyone else... they will hit u...  so yup..dats been my day... had a fairly quiet ride on the bus... and then popped over to benjis for awhile to play pool... have a good trip to bali!!! theres a senior concert tomorro... lester playin kompang again... i didnt see him at the fair... so i might go watch tomorro... if i can find a lift... we'll see...   ]-[3nRy

      hmmm...for once im not actually between doin my hmwrk when i write a post... im gonna write this before i start my hmwrk...well...actually... i jut cant be bothered to do any to tell the truth...   today started off as quite a rush... wid me runnin round everywhere!!! hehe...well...i woke up late...and had to rush to skool...but got there late...ran up to tutor room... and found out dat mr shorthose hadnt reached yet... hehe...then when no teacher came after awhile...ran down to get register...and was told dat students couldnt do it... but eventually shorthose came and got it done... then went down to bio... and ms bloomer hadnt come yet...so i ran down to dt to get my pencil case...ran bak to bio...and then realised i brought the wrong book...so ran to locker to get it and ran bak...hehe... it really hasnt been my day... or week...especially wid all the stuff i been forgettin...but it just the forgettin bit dats annoyin...im growin old...  had pshe and then break and then german.... we got our grades back for german...i just got an A*...so happy...hehe.. i got 30/32 overall... samira got 32/32... well done to her... hehe... rest of the day went pretty uneventfully... had games then lunch and then physics at the end of the day...we marked our tests and then got let out early... doesnt happen very often...  so yeah...today was a pretty uneventful day... a lot of news from the NBA tho...hehe... let see...first things first... lets just say that whining gets u everywhere...earlier on in the month i posted bout carmelo anthony being excluded from the USA Olympic Basketball team... and how he was whining bout it and how it was very unfair...well..dats all set to change... according to sources, he has now been given an invitation to join the team... woo hoo... good good... altho the team goin might not be as scary as the dream team... it definitely looks strong... [to read more bout the latest additions to the US team...click  urlLink here ]  nxt up from the bball world... the expansion draft was today...for all those dat dunno wat this is... literally... the NBA has a new team...called the charlotte bobcats... sounds kinda sissy to me but nvm... but yes... the team got to pick the players they wanted today... but the players they could pick from had to be free agents [i.e. they werent playing for the team currently or the player's contract has run out]... so yeah... probably the biggest name on the list they picked was gerald wallace... theres part of an article bout dat  urlLink here ... they also got the number 2 draft pick..should be interesting...  more gossip/news from the NBA...tho most of this stuff may be confirmed soon... t-mac may join yao [yes dats the big 7'5 chinese guy] in houston whilst francis mobley and cato go to orlando... shaq also wants a trade from LA...and by the looks of things...kobe may end up stayin in LA... dats if the jury in colorado deems him as innocent...well...not guilty... if they do find him guilty... kobe bryant will be sportin a new black and white striped uniform... payton has resigned wid the lakers also... he's a funny guy... check this quote out... "I'm more of a (guy who) wants to handle the ball, control the ball, penetrate, get eight or nine assists and take 10 or 11 shots off floaters and runners," he said before the finals. "That's my game. I'm not a shooter. I'm more of a scorer." arent shooters scorers also?! i dunno...  wells...time to get started on my maths...   ]-[3nRy

       urlLink     so...as we all know... the Detroit Pistons are the new NBA Champions... and wat an excitin series it was....not... to tell the truth... the pistons completely embarrassed the lakers... and yes...the better team did win...  first of all...the pistons were playin like a team on a mission... and completely dismantled the lakers... they played harder...better defense...and wanted the ball more...  the lakers may have four hall-of-famers in their team... but 2 of them are "not in order" like many of the exhibitions in the msian science centre... they played horrible offense and i have never seen a team as confused and unorderly as the lakers made the finals... but i spose they did make a couple of good plays...and they did win game 2... so yeah...ill give dat to them...  one of the big problems the lakers have is dat they dont have any set plays for Kobe... for all u kobe-haters out there... im sorry...but u just gotta admit it... he's a great player... the lakers cannot rely on shaq alone to score those buckets... as good as he is... bball is a team game... and the lakers arent playin as a team...and they definitely not playin good bball... to quote a laker fan: i know there is no "I" in "TEAM", but there is no "D" in "LAKERS" funny stuff...but its completely true... nxt yr... we might see a whole new laker line-up... phil jackson, gary payton and bryant may all be leavin...whilst karl malone is still decidin whether or not he is goin to retire... i dont think the lakers might ever be the same again...  but gotta give it to the pistons... they are a solid team... and a scary one too... not a line-up to mess wid... ben wallace is a savage animal... rip hamilton outruns ferrari's as a warm-up... then theres rasheed wallace and chauncey billups...both of them can play...and finally there's my man tayshaun prince... =D... don't forget dat this is only his second yr in the NBA... he's definitely gonna be one of them top 10 frwrds!!! if he isnt one already dat is... and no lester...neither keith van horn or nene are better than prince...  this has gotta be a good year for the people in Mo'Town and the owner of the pistons...he owns the detroit shock [WNBA champions] and the tampa bay lightning [NHL champs]... i got my money on the pistons winnin again...provided they keep the same line-up... so dats it for this NBA season...detroit will still be celebratin... and it'll be a long off-season for the lakers... ill leave u guys wid pics from game 5...   urlLink    Big Ben skies for another rebound...dunks this one bak in   urlLink    Kobe Bryant...needs his own set plays?   urlLink    Big Ben...doing what he does best   urlLink    Chauncey Billups   urlLink    Tayshaun Prince   urlLink    Happy chappies...   urlLink    Ben Wallace with the NBA Trophy... and Chauncey Billups with the MVP     As for the lakers... its a long walk home...     urlLink      ]-[3nRy

       urlLink    Pistons won Game 3 in The Palace of Auburn Hills...Detroit home ground... well...after watchin the game...i have figured out why the lakers lost... firstly... they faced one of the best defenses...if not  THE BEST ... in the league.. they were limited to only 68 points... a franchise low in the playoffs i think... and they have 4 hall-of-famers in their team... dats how good the pistons defense was... secondly... the lakers offense really really sucked...they lacked rhythm and were highly unorganised... and finally... the offense of billups and hamilton... damn... just incredible... i think the lakers are gonna hafta work for their rings...  urlLink     one more thing dat u bball fans might wanna know... carmello anthony...a.k.a Melo... is very pissed off with being left off the US Olympic bball team... in an interview... he said: "They've got their mind set on what they want," Anthony said of the USA Basketball selection committee. "Don't nothing include Carmelo. Nothing in the NBA includes me. You realize that?" Asked what other NBA-related events he had been omitted from, Anthony said: "Everything." Anthony, who led all rookies in scoring in 2003-04, finished second to Cleveland Cavaliers guard LeBron James in Rookie of the Year voting. Neither was named an All-Star, but James will play for Team USA in Athens this summer, and Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade, another rookie, also is expected to be named to the team. he has every right to be angry... dat kid can ball... and he has proven it... losin the Rookie of The Year award to LBJ was bad enough... but this is just b/s... maybe the "B" in NBA stands for business instead of bball... cos wat the NBA is doin only seems to be for its own good and an attempt to hype it up more... (i.e. givin lebron the ROY and givin him a spot on the US roster)... the US rationale for excludin Melo is dat the small forward position is already overstocked... the current roster includes:  Mike Bibby Tim Duncan A.I. LeBron James Richard Jefferson Stephon Marbury Shawn Marion Jermaine O'Neal Amare Stoudemire  doesnt look super scary... but good enough i spose...but Melo should still be on there... dats my 2cents....feel free to give me urs...  ]-[3nRy

      todays been a blur... almost like a dream... might've been cos of dat simulated crash... maybe not... wtv it is... it feels like im just watchin from sumwhere faraway... strange....  got up in the morn...and realise dat im runnin ahead of schedule in my daily routine... so i got a couple of minutes...read a magazine...on bball wat else?!...and then broadened my sister's knowledge by telling her of who the Ku Klux Klan were... she's a bit blur... hadn't even heard of tupac till i told her...  get to skool...and it all quiet for awhile... till ppl come in... then had a lil assembly/demo on road safety courtesy of Schlumberger (pronounced "schlum-ber-schzay"...kinda rhymes wid touche... not "schlum-burger")... watched a lil video...and then saw this lil machine thing called..."The Convincer"... sounds scary doesnt it... basically just simulates a crash at 15km/h... not very fast... i took a ride on it... had to sign this thing which said dat they werent responsible for any injuries/death caused to me... its not too bad...kinda knocks the wind out of u for a couple of seconds... watched a couple of other ppl ride it... looks nasty how ppls heads just snap forward...they put a watermelon in the seat... just to show us the "nasty" consequences of crashing... when the thing crashed...the watermelon just stayed in the seat...then just kinda rolled out... dont think dat went quite as planned... but i guess the lil crash is a good reminder to buckle up...tho i really dont imagine anyone gonna do it on them buses... my bus dont even go all dat fast...  then had chem... ms liew started sayin how me and lester always used to be top of the class but our standards seem to be slippin now... geez...cut us sum slack... sum ppl expect a bit too much... i got an A...and im happy...  rest of the day went... had maths...then had dt...then econs... nothin much happen really...didnt do very much work... tho jing got a lil upset over sumthin... and felix is walkin a fine line right now... lester has plans to kill him...cos he pasted jing loves lester on jings locker...or sumthin like dat... not a good idea... soon enough was on the bus on my way back... and im home now...safe and sound... sat alone on the bus...had sum time to think to myself... got sumthin on my mind right now... maybe i tell u another time...  GOOD LUCK TO THOSE DOIN THEIR FRENCH GCSE!!!!   ]-[3nRy

      today was a sumwhat interestin day...if u can call it interestin... for starters...i had very little tests today... which was a good thing... started off wid bio... which was a bit better than dat traumatic extension paper which probably scarred everyone for life...couple of questions which i didnt have much of a clue too... but at least u could have a guess... for example... there was sum question on wat colour a positive benedicts test result gave... i picked orange... cos it seemed like a nicer colour...compared to blue and purple... was right... see guys...the kangaroo key chain got  SUM "LUCK"   nxt up was german...i did coursework...so dat was ok... got a dictionary and my german stuff...just had to sit quietly and write bout how to keep fit.. hopefully i did alright...didnt have much to say... so wrote 200 or so words... samira on the other hand had plenty to talk bout... she wrote almost 300 words... not exactly unexpected...but nvm... the ppl who did french for block 5 were spose to have their french writin after dat...but dat got postponed...much to the relief of many... so the rest of the time after the test was spent talkin... while samira fretted over her IT test... vanessa was tellin me how she had to revise extra hard to understand the stuff...and benji was talkin to may... there was also a big debate over wat size floppy disks were...  then came lunch... this was the toughest part of the day.. and no it wasnt anythin to do wid pickin wat to eat... had more to do wid the lines of tryin to eat wat i picked... had sum roast beef of sum description... cuttin it was a nightmare... my hand got tired tryin to chop it up... not funny... chewing it was even worse... was almost like chewing gum... sum how or another...i finished my food... ppl dont call me rubbish bin and pack rat for nothin... food was followed by bball...played outside wid the yr 8's...had no shoes... was fun... tho i think i did sumthin to my ankle again...nothin too serious tho...i hope it isnt serious at least... apparently the bball indoors became a lil too violent... involved sumbody hittin another person cos he got elbowed...and also cos he was kinda frustrated... not mentionin names of course...but maybe a lil too much hustle if u ask me...i think they've apologised to each other...so it all good...  after lunch them ppl who did IT had their tests... apparently was well easy... rest of us had to "revise"...mr shorthose started tellin us bout a friend of his who caught crabs...another one who had his nose broken by a gf...and a kid he used to teach dat broke sum guys nose by jumpin on his head...ouchies... apparently there more sex ed nxt yr for yr 11...and he says he might be bringin in bananas and condoms... =S ... so dats a heads up for u ppl... tj already started practicin... he started humpin the table...  well...its bak to revisin for me... tho i dont seem to get very much done... o well... ill hope for the best...  ]-[3nRy

      Ok...so i am a little late on this... but tmac is now officially a rocket... well...he was one since yesterday... im glad the trade went thru... the rockets got McGrady, Tyronn Lue, Reece Gaines and Juwan Howard, whilst magic got Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley and Kelvin Cato... in my opinion...both sides stand to gain... but the rockets stand to gain more than the magic...  look at it... now we have yao ming and t-mac... pretty much 2 of the top 10 biggest players in the NBA... well... yao almost literally is the biggest... hehe...but think bout it... itll be like magic johnson and kareem abdul jabaar... or shaq and kobe... this team is goin to be destructive... with yao who dominates on the inside... and tmac cuttin and slashin to the hoop... the teams are just gonna start cryin cos they just cant stop them on defense... sounds scary... hehe... and heres another thing... they got a long time to spend wid each other... yao turned 24 this yr whilst tracy turned 25... prob got at least 4-6 if not more yrs together... wow...  wells.. everybody in houston  urlLink was happy  wid the trade... but the stupid magic GM or wtv started whinin and dissin tmac... i assure u...when tmac finds out...if he hasnt already... he's just gonna be more determined to win this yr... and he's also gonna be more determined to kill the magic everytime houston plays orlando... hehe... now the magic GM...is a dumbass...  lester and me now have an extra team to support then... he got his spurs... and i got my pistons...and we both got the rockets to support this yr... hoo boy... now to see wat happens wid the lakers....  ]-[3nRy
