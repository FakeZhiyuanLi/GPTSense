      i have serious problems. i am such a fuckin slacker. i have no modivation to wake up in the morning and it is bad news cause i keep skipping the only case i really should be going to. oh well i am sure it will be fine it is always fine.  i had lots of fun last weekend also. i am warn out from it though. the party was fun but being the cup person sorta blows cause you have to be all responsible. i love going on my roof and the night ended with the roof talk so im happy for that. if you havent been on my roof before you should come over and we can kick it together except for im a huge pussy and am rather slow so you have to deal with that when we go on the roof. everytime im a little less inhibited though.   i am at school i have to write this paper for thursday and i need to interview lynn, naomis old roomate but i dont even know how or what im supposed to be asking because i didnt go to class to ask the teacher today. oops. im gonna email the ta and see if she can email in time to find out what the fuck im doing. (oh incase you were curious im interviewing lynn because its a community psych class and i wrote a paper earlier on homeless women and the second paper is to either summarize 4 more papers on homeless women or interview someone who works with homeless women and lynn does.. yeah)  muffy is in town and that is super exciting. she is coming to chicago tonight so if you wre not doing anything you should come  i would like to note that when i say "you" i am referring to any of my friends that read this.  well im gonna go email some TA's sorry this is so boring

      the movie i saw was called Route 181: The South. 181 was the resolution created in 1947 to split Palestine giving 57% to jews and 43% to palestinians. Although jews accepted this, palestinians did not because they felt as if the land was theirs and giving 57% of it to jews would be equivalent to giving 57% of your house to the dude who stoll your car last week. yeah so anyway The South was because it was a three part movie based on geography (which I though was a really cool way to do it) it went through the south, north and center of Israel and the unrecognized territory of the gaza strip and west bank giving personal interviews to basically anyone they came into contact with that would talk to them. it was very interesting because you got a feel of how israelis and palestinians think. unfortunately i did not get a chance to see the center or the north but apparently its on dvd and im going to buy it. the south of israel is predominately israeli and therefore the movie was predominately of one opinion. being palestinian i understood where they were going with the movie. an important fact is that there was two directors of the movie a palestinian and an israeli. so its almost like a joke really. "a palestinian and a jew decided to take a road trip through israel, the west bank and gaza and take interviews.." anyway in the south they interviewed an eldery israeli man who worked for the israeli water museum. although they didnt discuss politics in the begining they did discuss water in israel. they asked questions hinted at the fact that israelis have all the water they could possibly ever need while palestinians were living in ghettos without water supplies. once any political talk about the oppresion of palestinians came up the elderly man freaked the fuck out no joke like he turned red and screamed it was kind of scary. anyhow even though i havent seen the other movied i know that when they go to the poor palestinian areas they will touch on the fact that they have no water. i might be saying this confusing but i just think its super cool. i cant wait to buy and finish it. unfortunately the movie can be very very boring i wish they could have made it in one movie instead of 3 but i am assuming it is virtually impossible to film the entire country in one movie. part of the movie is landscape because you watch them physically drive while they film outside from inside a car. you never see the interviewers only the interviewed and the landscape of the country through their eyes.  I feel this method of filming the opinions of the poeple of such a controversial area can be the most unbiased. Although there it still can show a biased view based on the questions asked by the interviewers it also shows random people with all different opinions. I also believe that the questions weren't very biased but I do feel the directors have an opinion.  When i buy the movie i hope that everyone will watch it.

      so i used to have one of these in a time of my life that was very fun and very painful at the same time. jessica has sparked the want to leave my thoughts for others to read. i attempted at choosing about 15 titles for this damn thing and this is the one that finally was not taken. apparently i am very unoriginal. oh well. anyhow hopefully you poeple will read and comment or else this is just not going to last. that is really how the old one died.  i am in the computer lab at school right now. that will probably be where i am when i write these since i no longer have internet. i have class in 15 and so i need to leave in 5 so this wont be to long.   i am taking 3 classes this summer. i have more school in the summer than i did during the year. i have class from 9-4 on T and Th and class from 1-3:30 M, W, and F. Tuesdays and Thursdays are super rough as you may have guessed. i am not a morning person. i am taking my second psychology class. a part of me wishes i would have done psych. i find it very fun and interesting. the class i am taking is community psych and i love my teacher. he is fun, interesting and makes the class fun and interesting. its not easy but its fun work rather than busy work. everything thursday we have these exercises due that come with some sort of group work its lots of fun. last week was 10 sentences that start with i believe... this week was observing a place that has enclosed borders and writing about the groups of people that were under or not represented. fun stuff. well i am gonna get going to art history now (which by the way is really interesting.. not the class but the fact that the art history kids are SO MUCH DIFFERENT than any other kids in my different classes.. mainly poli sci of coarse but yeah they are hip if you will) im out.

      apparently not updating your blog is a crime--that was the meanest blog comment ever jessica jeesh.  i am volunteering at the abbey and am trying to capitalize on internet as much as possible so i get to post again. for all who dont know i dont have internet so its hard for me to post.  i cant even talk much cause well like i said im volunteering and it is just rude to be doing personal shit but i will wait until scottie yells at me.  so lately i havent been doing much school is over i think i did pretty bad for all you who are wondering but i did graduate or at least im pretty sure i did i have an appointment with an advisor tuesday to find out.  i have been thinking about things and i  think im just going to suck it up and move back in with my parents... i know its horrible and i dont really want to but im trying to way in my positives and negatives here.   living with parents positives     i can get a job and save money which equals stuff, vacations, and paying off debt all the things having a job gets you, you know...and less stress about money  i can work on making myself happy rather than drinking my life away  i can still have my freedoms and sleep at all my lovely friends' houses right guys?  my parents house is pretty damn pimp--and girls you all can come over and kick it  just because i move back doesnt mean i have to be there forever im prolly gonna go to school in a year and than i will be back on my own with my responsiblity hopefully.   negatives     palos park no friends in palos park no privacy constant bitching constant fighting lack of freedom no chicago apartment no city ahhhh  my decision isnt final so i dunno what to think really but i cant type anymore i will blog soon though jessica.
