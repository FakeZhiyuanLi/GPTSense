      Why do you fear totalitarianism and dictatorship? What if your Fuhrer was magical, artistic, a dandy, or a fop? A sexy, hard man who cared about what you cared about. What if he was obsessed with the future as well as tradition? What if he longed to perform great works on a global stage but did not desire to reduce the entire planet to a smouldering charnel house ? What if he were a man above this inane political squabbling that seems so redundant and trivial? Of course, the youth remain mere fodder for the eternal death machine. The aging war pigs are terrified of suffering defeat at the hands of time. They are most terrified of the youth. Our youth are being led like lambs to their deaths. Soft, complacent and altogether oblivious of their wants, desires, needs as individuals with an eternal will to overcome the tyranny of monetary oppresion. Do you think your masters care a whig who you vote for? Either way, the economy reigns in your blood. Like parasites, the system eats away at your healthy flesh, rendering you too weak to combat it with studied, decisive action. As long as you remain ill, you will imagine that a choice exists between party A and party B. You will fail to see that they represent the same choice. It is simply a matter of how quickly you want to succumb to the promise of affluence, social significance, self worth that is affixed to personal income, savings accounts, vacation plans, money market accounts, etc. etc. That new I-Pod, DVD burner, plasma screen, etc. Status is a drug that is far more insidious than heroin, crack, PCP, or organized religion. Who you are dictated by who knows you and in what context.       "

      God, I'm ill.  I drank to many Tiki Mists today and it is going through me like a very dull blade.  Carving me up slowly and clumsily, wrenching back and forth, across tendons, into organs.  I'd rather have excruciating agony, instant fetal suffering.  I'd rather be rectally impaled upon a three-pronged spike. This inability to sit in the same place for more than 5 minutes before having to run into the water closet is making me yearn for a swift blow to the back of the head.  Pain is something I can relate to.  Incontinence is simply vulgar.  Only wretched hill folk should have to feel this way.  From drinking too much of the good turpentine.  Hell, if they drank too much of the good stuff, they'd probably be blessed with instant blindness, paralysis, vomiting, involuntary spasms, projectile diarrhea. Now, that would fill the day nicely.  Me, I am sitting here wondering if I'm ever going to get smart enough to lay off the soda pop.  I'm totally hooked on it even though I know it is rotting my teeth, corroding my intestines, fucking with the lithium's ability to keep me stable, sending evil sprites into my mind to force me to pray to strange, incompetent gods.  I worry about everything yet care for nothing.  I will never breed, nor spawn, nor flinch, nor say hello when I toss her honey body off the end of the pier.  She will not make me blink, or try to hold her down against the urge to shake her awake.  She is sperm soaked panties and harlot stares and angry teeth clenched in preparation for my ceremonial castration.  Her fingers, digging into my neck, my back, cock, arms.  Clawing, sharpening, teasing with flicks of the tongue and dry cackles of dust searing my flesh beyond time, above the struggle for identity and completeness.  Her mind is a nursery filled with crippled children high on meth and ghb.  Slobbering, bleating babies with broken limbs, scarred faces, hands gnarled in prayer.  She tries to think around them but they instinctively reach out and take hold of whatever is near.  No discernment, just need.  Raw, pulsating hunger.  To be fed, to have soiled nappies removed from chaffing asses red and burning with inarticulate rage.

      Smoking is going the way of all glamourous things. It has been ruined by the common weal. Like wearing fur, eating meat, drinking, fornication, killing the ill-constituted and weak, burning entire villages, etc. Smoking used to be a pleasure. Before it was commercialized for mass consumption and inevitable abuse, smoking was a luxury. The popularity of smoking has vulgarlized it. Yet it is still possible to enjoy a cigarette. One can still make love with sincerity and passion. A cigarette, a glass of absinthe, the glorification of past lives...
