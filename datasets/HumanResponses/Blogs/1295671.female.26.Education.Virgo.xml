      1st/2nd grade What's a jewia? Today we were talking about Sacajewia, the famous Native American who helped Lewis and Clark discover the Northwest.  "What's a jewia?" a boy asked. "You mean Sacajewia?" I said. "Yeah, what's a jewia?" he replied. Right then I realized that he thought I had said "sack of jewia".  I explained who Lewis, Clark and Sacajewia were.  Even at the end, some kids still didn't understand.  They asked,  "Why did they carry a sack of something across the United States?"   "What's in the sack?" "What's a jewia?"

      Third Grade I was reading aloud from "Ramona the Pest" by Beverly Cleary.  We came across a section of the book in which Ramona's Dad comes home and tells the family that the car's transmission is broken, and that the auto repair shop will let them pay in installments.  Knowing that the students probably didn't know what this meant, I asked them to take their best guess.    "I think it means that Ramona's Dad will have to pay before they install it."   Sounds logical to me….

      Yesterday I was in a kindergarten classroom that had A LOT of pets.  Have I ever told you how much I don't care for classroom pets?  I counted how many pets there were: 5 rats (my absolute least favorite) 1 hamster (almost as bad as a rat) 2 guinea pigs (not so bad)  1 rabbit  3 crabs  walking sticks a canary (These last three are the only three I would consider owning.  No biting or fur involved.) I don't mind being in the same room with these animals as long as they are in cages, but when the teacher asked me to feed them I considered reviewing my job description.  My main concern was the rats, but the guinea pigs were making hissing noises at me!!!!  I found a solution though - I know that kindergarteners LOVE to feed pets (just like they love to squeeze and "pet" them).  So I just asked a girl if she would be my helper and made sure that she was the one who reached into the cage and got the food bowl out.  The animals didn't attack her hand - which I really didn't think would happen but you never know.  Another funny thing that happened. When I was counting the animals I noticed an aquarium full of sticks and leaves so I asked a student, "What kind of animal is in that aquarium?" She said, "Oh, there's drumsticks in there." "What?" "Yeah, drumsticks."   I looked closer for some sort of insect I didn't know about.  Probably deadly.  They were walking sticks.

      epitaph for a newt  Kindergarten classrooms are often chaotic.  On one such chaotic day in one such chaotic classroom a newt was killed, but not intentionally.  I'm almost sure that if those PETA people knew what went on in kindergarten to classroom pets they would be picketing every elementary school in the country.    "Teacher! (frantically) The newt is stuck!!!" (visualize other children also screaming and jumping up and down in the background) Indeed, the newt was stuck.  It's head was stuck in the lid of the aquarium almost as if in the act of putting the newt back into the aquarium someone had closed the lid too early.  It's head was inside the aquarium and the rest of it's totally stiff and terrified body was outside. "OK", I said, "I'll open the lid and you catch the newt."  I assigned the roles this way because I don't like to touch dead newts.  The catch was successful. Me to the class - "Sometimes when a newt gets hurt he doesn't like to be touched or petted for a long time so we are going to leave the newt alone during choice time."  I said this as if the newt was alive.  This is the nice thing about being a substitute, the real teacher can break the bad news tomorrow.  I just have to break the news to her...

      We just spent a wonderful weekend with my best friend Sarah, and her friends (and my new friends) Tara and Paul.  We watched the Tuba Christmas downtown in the pouring rain.  200 tubas in Pioneer Square playing Christmas Carols.  Starbucks, rain and tubas - aaahhh - Christmas is here.

      Third Grade This story is one I remembered from a couple weeks ago. We were reading something historical in which they used the word "petticoat".  You know, those things that women used to wear. I asked the students if anyone knew what it meant.  "I think it's like one of those little sweaters that they put on dogs sometimes."

      Merry Christmas everyone.  Our house smells like cranberries and oranges.  We are heading out to Peacock Lane (a local street that has Christmas lights).  Paul is finishing up the presents he is making.  Tomorrow we are going to the Robinsons and to a Christmas Eve service at Mosaic, our church.  On Christmas we are going to the Tupper's.  Paul has the rest of this week off and all of next week.  We are so excited to get to spend some time together.

      This just in: ALF is back!!!!  My family used to watch ALF all the time.  I copied this from yahoo:  "The 7,385 signers of the "Bring Back ALF" online petition letter have finally gotten their wish.  The furry, cat-craving extraterrestrial star of the 1980s NBC sitcom, most recently spotted slumming it for long-distance services 10-10-220 and 1-800-COLLECT, has just landed his own show on Nickelodeon."

      There will be no funny school stories for a whole two weeks.  It's Christmas break!  I do have a cute Sunday School story for you though.  Paul and I teach the preschool class which has been fun.  Paul knows "the cleanup song" now.  I have once or twice been tempted to belt it out while he and I are cleaning up around the house, just for fun.  Anyway, yesterday Paul had to do the first part of Sunday School alone because I was doing a puppet show with two other ladies.  During the puppet show (which the preschoolers attended but didn't know that I was a puppet) my character said that Jesus came to earth as a "tiny baby".  Right after I said this a hear a little preschool voice out in the audience say (very earnestly), "No, he was a king, a king, Jesus was a king!"  Then I hear Paul, "Shhhhh, listen."  He said he smiled and winked at her, and she smiled back.

      No school again today for the third day.  You would think I would have cabin fever by now since we haven't ventured out in three days, but surprisingly I keep finding new ways to be occupied.  I spent two hours knitting in the Starbucks two blocks away from our house yesterday.  It's fun to see neighbors.   There is a thick layer of freezing rain (ice) on top of the snow but it finally seems as though it's melting.  Paul discovered a broken water pipe in our old house and is fixing it this morning.  I am going to walk to Safeway later.  Walking has been our only form of transprotation lately.  Hopefully tomorrow everyone will be back to normal, but snow days sure are fun!

      Hello weekend!  I have a three day weekend because of Martin Luther King Day.  This is one of the many benefits of being a teacher - so many days off!  Of course, being a substitute I don't get paid for them but I am looking forward to having a real job.  I have already started the job hunt for next year.  It takes soooooo long to fill out all those applications that I thought I would use all my days off being proactive (a good "interview" word - I'm practicing).  Who ever thought it would take so much work to get a job.  Whew! Speaking of MLK Day I remembered that yesterday I was speaking to a student about MLK because we had an assembly about it.  She said, "I think Martin Luther King was the king at the beginning of the world, he was probably the first one who was born."  Where that came from - I don't know. Today is Saturday and Paul and I spent it doing - as he puts it - nothing.  Sometimes what is relaxing to me is "nothing" to Paul.  We went out for crepes in the morning and then to the library, where I loaded up on books like "101 Best Resumes" and "The Idiot's Guide to getting your dream job".  Paul got some movies on things like snowshoeing and dog-sledding and mountains (he is having a mountain movie marathon even as I am writing this).   The library is our ultimate in cheap entertainment.  It's a paradise.  There is a library downtown called central library - it's hunormous.  It's beautiful.   We also like Barnes and Noble.  At first we felt a little guilty about reading all thier books and magazines without ever buying anything, but we go there about twice a month now, just to sit in comfy chairs and read.

      I haven't written much lately because I haven't been working much lately - with the storm and everything.  So today I was in one of my favorite classrooms - a first second split - and they are just so funny.  There are some conversations that teachers just aren't supposed to overhear, and when I hear them, I usually just chuckle and ignore them.  Today I heard one that went something like this: BOY: "It's not true, I never even kissed her!" (this is what I heard first so you can imagine why I kept listening) GIRL:  "But you are her boyfriend." BOY:  (very insistant) "No - I'm - not." GIRL:  "But you know even though you don't think you are her girlfriend, you are because she says so.  It's like, she doesn't have to be your girlfriend but you are still her boyfriend." BOY:  "I give up."

      Yesterday during a particularly boring lesson (not my choice of course - but one that the teacher left for me to do), my students were actually pretending to fall asleep.  I was tempted to let them get away with it.

      Kindergarteners sometimes freak out when a sub shows up.  Sometimes I talk to them about how thier teacher and I are alike and different just to calm thier fears.    ME:  How are Ms. Smith and I different? Student:  She has black hair and you have short hair. Another Student:  Your neck is bigger than hers. Another Student:  Yeah, like a giraffe. Another Student:  Yeah, you look like a giraffe.  So you can see where this conversation was going.  I stopped them short before they went on to other body parts.    The best part of today was watching "Finding Nemo".  It's a tough job but someone has to do it.

      The names in this story have been changed to protect the guilty. Get ready for this:  kids know alot more nowdays than they did five years ago.  One time I was subbing for a second grade class and I was flipped off by a student.  This story really contains two forms of misbehavior - tattling and swearing - the classics of childhood.   Here's how it went down: It's a typical overcast day in the northwest.  I line up my students and march them outside to go home.  Now, one thing you have to know is that students who misbehave naturally gravitate towards the back of the line so that they can talk and, in this case, swear.  I haven't really found a good way of preventing this.   When we reach our destination outside a stampede of second graders heads towards me.  Seriously, about ten children.  You know when a student is about to tattle because they have a look of victory and horror / disgust in thier eyes.  It only takes a few days to learn this look.  It makes a teacher want to run for cover.   "Eric said the f-word."   "Eric said a bad word." "Eric is swearing." This continues for a while.  All this while I am saying, "I know.  I realize that.  Please go back in line.  I know.........." Finally, a boy comes up to me after all the others have left, very seriously, and said, "I heard Eric say the word that means this."    And then he gave me the finger.  In front of a whole playground full of teachers, students and parents.  It was one of those moments that you remember in slow motion.  I knew that he thought that it was a nicer way of saying the same thing, so I talked to him a bit about why we don't use that gesture.  Even though I think it's sad that second graders know the f-word, this one of my best stories.  I told this story one time to some friends and one person said that when he was working with kids a student came to him and complained that someone had called him the j-word.  When he asked him what the j-word was he said, "Jerk."

      I just walked to the library and stopped by Zupan's.  When I was coming out of Zupans an older (probably homeless) man asked me a question.  I couldn't understand what he was asking me because he didn't have any teeth so I asked him to repeat himself.    "Do you currently indulge in the habit of nicotine?"    Now I don't often get asked if I have any smokes because I really don't look like I smoke, but this is the most creative way I have ever been asked for a cigarette.

      Tonight Paul and I were reading and drinking coffee at our favorite "crepe and coffee" place - Java Vivace.  If you hang out in a coffee shop in Portland long enough you are bound to see something weird.   A man came in the door waving an umbrella above his head, in calm, almost robotic-like movements.  He never stopped waving the umbrella and came into the room we were in with some other patrons and turned in a circle waving the umbrella all around the room.  The whole time he was saying in a monotone voice, " I read the Oxford Collegiate Dictionary.  I read the Oxford Collegiate Dictionary.  I read the Oxford Collegiate Dictionary."   Then he turned around and left just as quickly as he came in.   Paul and I were silent for a moment.  We looked around to see what other people's reactions would be.  One couple chuckled and rolled their eyes.  The barista didn't even raise an eyebrow.  No one else made any motion that signified that anything out of the ordinary had just happened in the room.   After a few minutes I had to start laughing, knowing that no one would be paying attention to me, just like they didn't pay attention to the crazy man.

      Yesterday a very disrespectful little boy called me "Mrs. Whatever".  It was one of those days that seems to drag on and on and on and on.  At one point I looked at the clock and thought, I can't believe I have only been here one hour.   Today was a different story however.  For an hour we watched "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" and ate cupcakes and cookies. That's the thing, when I wake up I really have no idea what will happen or where I will go or if I will have fun.  It's pretty much an adventure.

Yesterday I took some Claritin 24 hour non-drowsy extended release cold medicene in the morning to help get me through the day because I had to work.  It worked.  I was actually not drowsy for (almost) 24 hours.  I couldn't go to sleep until 3:30 last night.  Good thing I didn't have to work today.

ME:  I hear you have a great student teacher. Students:  Yeah ME:  What are some of the things you like about her? Student:  She does cool science experiments with us. Student:  She's nice. Student:  I like her because she is a teenager. ME:  Really?  A teenager?  She looks older than that to me. Student:  I think she's about 18 or 20. ME:  Well how old do you think I am? Student:  Probably about 30.  Turns out we are the same age...

      "I'm warning you, I'm not a counselor, I'm not even a middle school teacher," I said to the middle school "behavior management specialist" whom I was there to replace.  Once in a while there are not enough substitutes to go around and the automated voice calls you for a job you are not really qualified for.  I guess, technically, I am a certified teacher.  But let me tell you, the middle schoolers and I both know that I'm not supposed to be there.  I wonder how the behavior management specialist ended up teaching golf?  This was the only class I had to teach in the afternoon so I made my mind up that I could make it through.  I went to the gym thinking that there would be a person coming to teach golf and I would just be there to help.  When I got to the gym the PE teacher told me that the golf teacher would not be there today.  "Good luck", she said.  I have learned that when someone tells you good luck (especially secretaries) it's never a good thing.    So it's really hard for me to look like I know what I am doing when I don't - especially when it comes to sports.  The only other times I taught junior high I made the mistake of telling them I was really an elementary school teacher.  That was not a good move.    I'll have to say that the golf lesson went very well.  I even have to say that the day was rather amusing, although I will never go back.  Paul wants to go back to school next year to be a middle school science teacher.  I say good luck.

      I was a middle school counselor last week for (thank goodness) only half a day.  I'm sure there will be more on this later.  It was quite a harrowing experience.  I don't want to give it all away but I actually had to teach GOLF.  I know some of you who know me well are laughing right now because the actual amount of coordination and knowledge that I have in this area could be contained in a hollow easter egg.   More on this later... (I took notes while I was there for my blog knowing that it was good material - I think I am a blogging  nerd )

When we got to the part where the man gets rescued he said, "And then the American guy came and helped him out."

      This morning - very, very early in the morning Paul and I heard helicopters circling around and around.    "They must be looking for a fugative,"  I thought.  When we woke up we could still hear them,  there is a rapist on the loose in our neighborhood (don't worry mom my husband is watching out for me and has pronouced death to the man who harms his wife) so we thought maybe they were looking for him.    That is, until I went to work this morning.  I was driving to the Hawthorne bridge and just on the corner of Hawthorne and Grand is the courthouse building (about 12 blocks away from our home sweet fourplex) and all the gay couples were lined up to get married.  There were reporters and everything.    Then I got to work and I had to call the person I was subbing for.  Guess where she was?  At the courthouse getting MARRIED to her partner.  Then as I was coming home I saw the same scene again only huge.  News trucks, helicopters, the works.  Paul and I are going to walk down there now and watch the circus.  History in the making whether you like it or not.

      There are some seriously impressive blogs out there.  It makes me feel humble.  These people have links and you can leave messages for them and everything.  It's amazing.  I have been having fun checking out blogs from teachers and also christian blogs.   Check this one out from a christian teacher:  urlLink What in Tarnation?  Also, this one is impressive.  There is so much so see.  I'm still trying to figure out how to let people email me.   urlLink Jen Speaks  Stayed home today (no jobs) and washed all my windows, inside and out.  The reason for this was because I really couldn't stand to look at another job posting.  I would rather do housework than job hunt.  I also found the coolest cow serving tray at a thrift store.  The bad news is that there is no more housework to do, so if I stay home tomorrow I'm stuck with the job hunting.

Student:  Mrs. Robinson, you shouldn't walk in the grass in the morning. ME:  Why? Student:  Because a lot of people bring their dogs here and the dogs go poop and the principal doesn't have time to clean it all up before we get here.

      I've had a dry spell of good stories to write in my blog, even though I have been busy.  I'm feeling better about looking for a job too.  The school system here run in rounds, so that the most experienced teachers get first dibs at the jobs.  I am in (of course) the last round of hiring, but I was encouraged by some teachers that were telling me that alot of the good jobs don't even open up until the last round. I wish I had a digital camera so I could take some pictures of some of the flowers that are blooming around our hosue.  Spring is here! I am expecting a new baby nephew any day now.  Everytime the phone rings I think, he's HERE!  But not yet.  I will post when he comes.

      Hi, lately I have been suffering from bloggers block, probably because I have been sick.  I'm on the other end of it now though.  It's a throat problem.  I've spent a day and a half on my deathbed and now it's time to live again.  My cold's are much shorter these days since I've found some miracle herbs that cure me every time.  The Robinson's made an important purchase this week - a rope for rock climbing.  Just one more activity to add to our repertoire of outdoor stuff.  Now we can canoe, rock climb, backpack, camp, etc.  Much to Paul's delight.    Update:  Now we can mountain climb too since my Dad just found some crampons and an ice ax at a garage sale for thirty dollar.  He's handy to have around.

      Believe it or not, I have never been to Learning Palace.  I always thought it was for teachers who weren't creative enough to think of things on their own (I can be snobby sometimes, everyone has an ugly side).  Well, today I went and let me tell you this place is like cocaine or heroin for teachers.  Seriously, I could have spent ALL day there.  If you are a parent or teacher, let me warn you, it's a dangerous place.  Fortunately, I was there to spend my church's money (I am in charge of getting supplies for preschool Sunday School), so not much damage was done.  I had myself convinced that since I can write teaching things off on my taxes and they give a ten percent discount it's really practically FREE.  You'll be happy to know that I have landed safely back in the land of reality.

Paul:  The are too big. ME:  They will shrink.  They are exactly the same size as the ones you have now. Paul:  OK  Today:  ME:  Why are you wearing your old T-shirts? Paul:  They are too long.

      A deli owner is being credited with saving the life on a 90-year-old customer who never misses her morning coffee. So when she failed to show up the other day, the owner got worried and called police, who rushed to her home in the nick of time. Parsippany police say that if Chris Kim hadn't called them, his 90-year-old customer probably would have died in her bath tub, where she had been trapped for almost two full days. That's customer service ...

Our weekend was great, Paul and I helped his parents get moved into their new house.  It has a hot tub, so we're pretty excited about that.  Other things we did this weekend: -bought kumquats (Paul swears that I will like them) -rocked out at church -barbecued  -walked at Hoyt Arboretum  -ate out at Red Robin (the place we always go when we can't decide where to go and don't want to try anything new)

My heart leapt with joy.  I can't tell you how wonderful it made me feel.  My very first apple.  I went out and bought myself some shoes for the occasion.  They make my feet look like little presents - you'd have to see them.  They're red.

      Well, I just wrote a gut-wrenching, heart-breaking post about my spiritual struggle with job searching, but it accidentally got erased, so I will not write it over again.  It's a cloudy day here in Lake Wobegon (er- I mean Portland).  The mist is rising over the West Hills.  It's a day when I wish I had a bike.   I don't know if any of you know this but Paul and I have some pet birds.  Well, they really are wild and they live outside but we like to think of them as our own.  We hung a bird feeder a couple months ago and now our house is the most popular gourmet hangout for all the birds in Portland.  Seriously, birdseed is going to start taxing our budget.  Someday, when I have my own digital camera I will take a picture.  I can hear them right now because the backdoor is open.  It's very comforting and now I think living here would be boring without the sound of our pet birds.  Another thing about pets, I want a dog, but Paul is against it.  That's another post.....

      In an effort to attract more pet birds to our house, Paul is putting in a birdbath.  I'll let you know how it works out.  No luck on the dog issue either.  I tried pleading in my most pitiful voice.  He's immune.  So we can have more birds, but no dog, where's the logic in that!!!

       Odd experience of the week:   We bought a book about our new truck (manual type) on Half.com the other day.  A few hours later a man shows up at our door with the book and money to reimburse for the shipping we paid.  HE LIVED IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.  Of all the places in the world this book could come from, he lived in our NEIGHBORHOOD.  It actually wierded me out a little.   For those of you who don't know how half.com works:  if you have a book you want to sell you can just post it on this website and people can buy them from you and it's your responsibility to send it to them.  Kind of like eBay without the bidding.

      For a reward today let the kids watch "The Fox and the Hound".  We watched half of it on Friday and half today.  I am amazed at how much kids love that movie even though it was made in my childhood.  Our family had a record of the soundtrack to the Fox and the Hound and we used to listen to it over and over.  I can still hear Big Momma...

      If you were praying for me today, thanks.  The interview went well.  As I was on my way to the interview, I stopped to get gas at a local gas station.  When the attendant (who was a nice, older man) saw that I was dressed up, he asked if I was going to work.  I said no, I'm actually on my way to an interview.  He looked me straight in the eye and with the kindest, most sincere smile on his face he said, "Oh, I just know you're gonna be great.  I'll bet you're just the person they're looking for."  It made my day!

      Well, it's a hot day here in PDX.  Yesterday Paul put the air conditioner in our bedroom window.  Alas, the poor little machine only cools one room even if we strategically direct the air flow with fans.  It doesn't often reach the 90's here.   We have harvested spinach, lettuce and radishes from our garden so far this year.  Oh, how I wish I had a digital camera.  I would take pictures of all our produce.  Paul is such a diligent farmer.  The rows are planned perfectly and placed painstakingly.  Each vegetable is cottled and harvested at exactly the right time.  I'm so proud of my perfectionist husband.  He really is reaping the rewards and daily explodes with joy at some new change in the garden. Well, that's the news here in Portland, Oregon.  Where the sun shines brightly, the vegetables grow strong, and the husbands are above average.

      If you are a person who sees Paul pretty often you may notice that up until now he has been wearing a different variation of the same thing for most of his life.  Don't get me wrong, I love the look!  But, there are only so many combinations of jeans and t-shirt possible. Paul and I decided that new threads were in order.  We went shopping today specifically for Paul.  He's now a fan of the funky button up shirt!  You'll notice next time you see him - a new confidence - a new style.  I do have one thing to say though, we did buy an ungodly amount of polo shirts.  I guess you can't teach an "old Paul new tricks".

Helpful advice from my grandma when I told her about the test:  "take big bites Annie, then you won't need dinner."  That's why I love her!

      We sold our car.  It wasn't as painful as I thought it was going to be, especially when we started to decide which kind of digital camera we were going to buy with the money.  We chose one and so far we love it.  Paul figured out how to work it in two minutes. Below are some pictures of out first day with our camera.  We had fun playing around with it.  I am really excited to be able to share more of our life through our blog.  I know my family especially enjoys reading it and many of our friends as well.

      We have a car to sell!  Anyone need a car with high milage that overheats in the summer sometimes?  It's a steal at 800$.  The other day I was cleaning out the car and became very emotional as memories of first date, first kiss, honeymoon and vacations came flooding back to me.  I can asure you that as the sold car drives away from our house there will be tears in my eyes.  I have to remind myself that a sold car means a new digital camera for me and my little blog!

We were about 20th in line and scored some hiking boots, chacos, a backpack and some climbing shoes all for ridiculously low prices.  We've decided to make it an annual event.  We've been before but never gotten up so early.  And yes, in case you are wondering, Dave Duff was about third in line!  He always beats us. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      One time, when I was young, my brother and I were in the same Sunday School class.&nbsp; It was a small church.&nbsp; The Sunday School teacher (bless her heart) asked us the inevitable question about what had been going on in our lives.&nbsp;  My brother liked to tell stories.&nbsp; Mostly ones that weren't true.&nbsp; So while him and I were there in front of everyone he made up a story about how his family had gone to Hawaii that week on Alaska Airlines.&nbsp; Being young and innocent I first thought, "wait a minute, did I miss something..."&nbsp; Then I thought, "is he really stupid enough to let me catch him lying so I can tell on him".&nbsp; As much as my brother liked to lie, I liked to tattle.&nbsp;  Then I realized, " It's fun to lie!"&nbsp;  I felt a camaraderie with him, and even thought about helping him out.&nbsp; Even as an adult, I sometimes wonder whether I could make up stories and get away with it.&nbsp; The thought crossed my mind earlier today.&nbsp; "What if I started a blog that only contained made up stories by me?"&nbsp; The thought was electrifying!&nbsp; This is what is so beautiful about blogging.&nbsp; &nbsp; P.S. I mean lying in the most non-harmful&nbsp;way :)

The highlight of the trip for me was seeing two black bear cubs walk across the road in front of our truck.&nbsp; It was the first time I had ever, ever seen a bear.&nbsp; Paul saw the mother bear, but my eyes happened to be closed at the time.&nbsp; I so wish we had gotten a picture - because they were CUTE.&nbsp; Here are some pictures we did take:

No, I haven't grown in quite a while (I'm 26).  Well you must be getting skinnier then.  I think these ladies see me as a perpetual teenager.&nbsp; I will never grow up in thier eyes.&nbsp; Even when I have grandchildren I will still be just a kid to them.&nbsp;

      portion of an email from a friend:   "Have you noticed that people who have gardens turn into stalkers during the summer? Mystery sacks of produce show up on our doorstep all the time. I have my own garden and can't possible eat all the stuff that is ready, so I force it on people who don't want it too. It is a vicious cycle. Hope you are enjoying the summer bounty!"  my reply:  "Yes, I have experienced the summer garden stalkers, and have been one of them myself.  I sent a bag of lettuce with Paul to work one day and told him not to come back with a single leaf!  Our tomatoes are about to come on, and I am afraid that in force they will be extremely dangerous.  I may end up tossing them at passers by and then running away."
