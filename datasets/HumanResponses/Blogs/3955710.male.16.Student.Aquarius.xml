       Greetings, fellow strangers. I got a comment from 'Anonymous' about my little query on metaphysics. He gave me a link which is cool, so I'll check that later.    &nbsp;  This week's sorta boring really. There's loads I could do, but I can't be bothered to do. Like the aforementioned Sainsbury's application form. My mum asked me why I hadn't done, so I said 'mental illness'. This is actually true. I suffer from a behaviour pattern called Avoidant syndrome, which is a common psychological problem where people with the syndrome prefer to let others make big decisions for them. There is actually a really good DIY psychiatric test online, here's the link.    &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.4degreez.com/misc/personality_disorder_test.mv     &nbsp;  Sorry, I suddenly realised we have 5 street atlases next to me. I don't have a clue why. My strange family. Thinking of families, they're going to scrap the sitcom 'My Family'. Yay! It seems that the best shows have the shortest runs, while the crap ones go on for ever. I don't really believe about the whole going out at the top stuff, I think that's shit. Will & Grace has done like 100 episodes, and Friends did 200+.    &nbsp;  Thinking of TV, I was watching a show called 101 Embarrassing Sexual Accidents last night. Some gay blokes decided to make bedtime fun by pouring quick setting concrete up their ass. Concrete sets pretty quickly, especially 'quick setting'. You should always read the label! Also Taiwanese women enjoy putting their mobiles up their ass, with the ringtone on vibrate. But it said this gives you incontinence, so don't try it kids!    &nbsp;  See ya   THOM    &nbsp;

       Good evening, y'all!    &nbsp;  K was a character in The Castle by Franz Kafka, one helluva book. Sex, fear, hate, death. What more could you want?    &nbsp;  Victor has been evicted from Big Brother. Victor acted like a bit of a cunt, constantly trying to wind people up with his  braggadocio  and  machismo  attitude. And he didn't think he would leave! He's not a real gangster or Yardie anyway, just a jumped up twat. I think Dan will win, maybe Stuart. I like Stuart's attitude, doesn't get involved in anything, just sits there and soaks it up and gets laid.    &nbsp;  I have just seen Spiderman 2 with Marcus and Mark, it was very good. Good acting, particularly from Alfred Molina playing the villain, and obviously nice to see Kirsten Dunst. They've left it open for a 3rd film, which I believe they're making right now. Went to Woking to see it, and then went in McDonalds afterwards. It was alright until about 20 chavs came in and made it ChavDonalds. Also there was a poster in there asking for new staff, offering 'a good wage'. Yes, at Â£4.25 a fucking hour! Hi-larious. We decided to make a quick exit, and got back to the delights of Ash Vale and Heath End respectively.    &nbsp;  Thinking of chavs...  urlLink http://www.chavscum.co.uk     urlLink http://www.chavtowns.com     &nbsp;  Great websites.    &nbsp;  Ooh my holiday's in 8 days, which is cool. Had a look at the map today and looked at the mountains. Scarily massive, there were even permanent glaciers, where the snow never melts and it's perma-ice. There's a road right the way up one of the mountains, which is 1565m tall, way higher than Ben Nevis. There's some mountains which are getting on for 3500m (10500ft). Looks wicked. Hopefully, the surf's up again, like the storm last year when they had the 15ft waves.    &nbsp;  Still thinking of X. I really should e-mail her and tell her my feelings. As they said in Spiderman, 'if you keep love inside you, it's going to make you sick'.    &nbsp;  Signing off,   THOM

       Bonsoir, retards of the universe. Me and Rakhee have just been debating black. Black as the colour. Apparently it isn't a colour, but if it wasn't, the Universe couldn't exist. Confused? Yeah. Please go on this website for some real brain gymnastics.    &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.rotten.com/library/religion     &nbsp;  And then scroll down and click on  Quantum Physics  for advice how to phone your future self. Strange like a lemming in the desert.    &nbsp;  Question: Does anyone know what metaphysics actually is?    &nbsp;  In other news, I almost had a emotional breakdown last nite because of my crap life but in the end I didn't. For me my depression isn't like a black dog, it's more of a black curtain which goes down over my eyes and everything gets dark. It's scary cos it gets worse and worse until it gets better. There's not too much to worry about at the moment, but then there is actually and I can't be bothered to explain it to you.    &nbsp;  What a great blog it is! I could be all candid and confessional like Oli was in his blog, but I don't have the nerve to tell everyone what's going on inside my head.    &nbsp;  I'm not sure why I chose the title today. It just sprang out of the air.    &nbsp;  See Ya    &nbsp;  THOM

       Hello    &nbsp;  Thought for the day: Will there ever be a time when there is nothing to write about? The answer is no because there is always something happening and until the point where there isn't it is. That last sentence looks so fucked up now.    &nbsp;  Word of the day: FUBAR- Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition. Can someone comment and say if this was actually invented on't t'internet or if it was there before? Cos I don't know.    &nbsp;  Today I listened to Jimmy Carr on XFM. Wow! He is brilliant on the radio (or on the TV in my case, eating Bitesize Shredded Wheat) He was talking about people who have had 'insult added to injury'.     &nbsp;  One bloke had had his shoe pissed in by some boy, who had then smacked his tooth out with the same shoe. Later that evening he decided to go to his friend's party, where he encountered the boy again, this time fucking his girlfriend. That's what I call world-class bullying.    &nbsp;  He also asked listeners to text in examples of Pikey Behaviour in their family. My personal favourite was the man complaining about his wife who had ran off with his mum. (And I thought my family was fucked up)    &nbsp;  Mr. Carr also played The Futureheads who are currently  ausgezeichnet . You will visit this link below:    &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.thefutureheads.tk     &nbsp;  And download from the 'super information highway' as it was called on the TV about 10 years ago, and play the 'Decent Days and Nights' video.    &nbsp;  Also watched golf today. There is one major irony in golf; whoever gets the lowest score wins. Crazy but true.    &nbsp;  Kalling out from Starship Afrika    &nbsp;  THOM    &nbsp;

       Hi! I will continue to give my titles self-consciously cool names because i'm pretentious and artistical. I have suddenly realised how uncool music fashionistas are. I mean what could be more boring and bland and 'alternative' than wearing a CGBG tee? I mean show a bit of imagination. That reminds me; order stuff off:    &nbsp;   urlLink www.cjs.net      &nbsp;  I want an At The Drive In tee and a Mars Volta tee so I want to wear them because I like the bands not as a statement  de la mode . I will also use French, Spanish and German terms because I'm pretentious&nbsp;like that. It will also look studenty. To complete this look... arggggh!!! that's what i was diatribing about in the first place. Can we really avoid the influence of cool? No. I might just say fuck it and get an afro... but I haven't got curly hair and I'd look ridiculous. Ah well.    &nbsp;  Have just written a poem/song called Arctic Snow. I may post it on this at a later date. Most of my poetry I write at 2am in the morning, fuelled by a mix of Coke, DT Instant (Double Triple Coffee, six teaspoonfuls of granule, downed in one. Ferocious) and Chili Heatwave Doritos. It generally concerns girls I either fancy&nbsp;or have fancied. You didn't think I actually had a girlfriend, did you?&nbsp;At the time it all looks brilliant, and I imagine poetry critics comparing me to a young Dylan Thomas. But in the cold harsh light of day it is always crap. However Arctic Snow might be different.    &nbsp;  Avoiding poetry though, I could be a singer/songwriter like Ben Kweller, Ryan Adams e.t.c. (Thought For The Future)    &nbsp;  Next time I will do a complete profile and really sort of introduce myself. Then we're going on a little tour of Starship Afrika and then we're going to warm up for my holiday by doing the TOP 5 HOLIDAY MOMENTS! (includes plages nudistes, seasickness and crazy germans playing crazy golf!)    &nbsp;  A Bientot de Starship&nbsp;Afrika!   THOM    &nbsp;   &nbsp;
