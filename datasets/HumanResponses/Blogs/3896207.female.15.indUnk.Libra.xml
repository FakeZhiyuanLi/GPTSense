      I&nbsp;had my oral test&nbsp;today. I&nbsp;happened to be oblivious to it and&nbsp;didnt do any preparations for it, despite the fact that&nbsp;I didnt expect myself to be called today.  I must be having bad lucks coz i'm the last who was called. I didnt want it to be delayed until next lesson because of the teacher, saying that should anyone who wanted to call upon that oral test will be deducted 50% of the marks. I didnt want my marks to be cut down, so I did it with my common general knowledge... I wasnt having much confidence facing the teacher's stern look. When I was there in front of her,&nbsp;I was having butterflies. I did tell my teacher frankly that&nbsp;I didnt do any preparations but she still didnt want to give me a chance.She said she was tensed seeing me doing that oral, heh.  My topic was Child Abuse. I did the elaboration by myself and it hiddenly means that&nbsp;I got stuck in the middle, a lot. I was damn sad and nervous, but still&nbsp;I had to face it just now. Hell.  Grrr--I dropped 2 marks!!I was quite disappointed just now. But, come to think of it, I did it right there..without any preparations. I can still accept it though. There's still 1 oral test left for next year, work it carmen!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I went to Air Force Museum today. It's located at the Mes Wira Angkasa, RMAF Base, Sungei Besi, yeah, it's near MBS-Methodist Boy School. Shit,&nbsp;I have to wake up early in the morning. We ended up to&nbsp;be the first batch to arrive at the MBS and then only we were taking off to the&nbsp;Air Force Museum.   When we reached there, there was no better. We still have to wait; the interactors from other school were so 'punctual' and thank them very much. What to do... So&nbsp;I just waited there and pray for excitements coming right up.   As usual, we have to be seated before the speech given by those so-called VIPs in the function. That is a vocational service project for the career opportunities in the uniformed services. To&nbsp;foster the ideals of service&nbsp;as a basis of worthy enterprise. I was sorry that&nbsp;I think&nbsp;I wasnt paying full attention on those speech, kinda feeling sleepy and bored. *yawn*   They&nbsp;shown us the career opportunities in the Royal Malaysian Air Force, as well as the Police Force. They are paid so well, but the thought of being one of those categories&nbsp;didnt flow to my mind. Sorry. After that, there was a personal experience being told by a police officer. That was tremendously cool!!&nbsp;Their refreshments could be the favourite part which we enjoyed the most.Not to mention the visit to the RMAF Museum, that was well, acceptable, just nice.Forgetful me forgot to bring camera along!! What a huge mistake!!   On our&nbsp;excursion to the MBS, there was a  lil'  misunderstood with the interactors from&nbsp;the Victoria Institution.They played a trick and built up our curiosity man! And then something happened. Sigh. That was&nbsp;definitely my friend's fault. Anyways, no worries!   A&nbsp;delightful visit.   &nbsp;

      Another week has come to an end. At least almost.  How&nbsp;I loved today...   It was raining. The weather's been cold and chilly. Just exactly what&nbsp;I wanted.. Looking out the window,&nbsp;I saw a plant. And, i was dreaming, during accounting lesson. Teacher's masterpiece of howling a lullaby to us was such a success!! No offense, teacher. Thanks for your hardwork though.   Not meeting Good Friend. At least we can still contact via email or sms. What a great&nbsp;science and technology. Chill.   &nbsp;

      Wednesday again. Sometimes i like wednesday, sometimes i dont. Why? well..mainly because some reasons for sure. I enjoyed wednesdays for the passed few months ever&nbsp;since i've transferred to this school, (for your information, yes i am a new student!! but, i guess not anymore. it's already July man!) because i used to have a good friend who has&nbsp;transferred to another school somewhere in Pahang that would play volleyball with me..there were four of us then. This thing could be complicated, you know, me-transferring-to-this-school-then-a-good-friend-of-mine-transfer-to-another-school thing. She has left us for exactly 52 days and i guess it'll be 52 weeks soon. How i longed to meet her since she's gone. Without her presence, i can not play volleyball that joyfully as i was, this is&nbsp;due to the fact that&nbsp;there are only three of us now, not to say we're selfish, it's just that we like to play in a small coterie of people. Her absence has stopped my urge to play volleyball.  I played the basketball today. I'm sorry for the opponents. I grabbed the ball from them for my team's sake. But, that was just a game. Watching the ball bouncing on the floor, i thought of my ex-high school days...Sigh.&nbsp;I played volleyball and basketball then. Err..i did mention here that i'm not a good player at neither one of them, didnt i?&nbsp;Haa, besides those activities, i 'talked' under a shady place which is something i loved. What to worry about, my teacher didnt care..he was being so nice to us.  IF  he really turns around, we just pretend like we're playing, that's all&nbsp;i did&nbsp;then.&nbsp;But hey, everyone likes it right? Okay, except for guys. Alright, that was history. Now, my time is controlled by the teacher. She will make sure all of us are doing something, at least not&nbsp;something i used to do..*sigh*  Actually avoid making things worse then, i didnt mention that there is a new student in my class..by all means..one has gone then one came. I'm still trying to be friends with her.. I think, she's okay anyway. Good Friend is coming back this Friday, maybe. Miss ya and cant wait gal..  &nbsp;

      How time passed..it's already Friday!! man, i like Friday..it just feels so great..put aside my homework for a moment i mean. I know, homework are endless..you are given homework everyday..yeah..i mean it!&nbsp;I tried to finish my homework that's given out on that particular day..but i just..couldnt! Why?? Why?? Is there anything wrong with me? or just me..of being lazy.&nbsp;I guess so, but i dont want all these..really!! i wanna finish my homework earlier... so that i can do some other useful things, which i'm interested of course.  &nbsp;  Wanna know what are those ?? If you know me well, guess you've already have the answer..anyway, to satisfy your curiosity, things like..reading my story books..scan through the lyrics.. and all..sigh..these are some things not&nbsp;anyone will do but, that's just me.. :p  &nbsp;  I'll be going for a body check up tomorrow, kinda fear of that.God, please dont let anything to be fallen on me...Hell yeah..this leads me to the hard time that i've once been through.. I've seen my beloved grandma died of liver cancer. It hurts. Argh..i still miss her... even if she's not here with us right now, but i know she has become our guardian angel up above..  enough of that, i dont wanna recall the moments we've shared..the moments we've rushed all the way&nbsp;to the hospital..the&nbsp;moments..&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyway, just hope everything goes right tomorrow...Look, i'm still hoping!!  No matter what i do, i just cant get myself off the Hope. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sometimes&nbsp;I shudder myself to realise the fact that fact is doubtless, still&nbsp;fact. Fact hurts, sometimes. Indeed, it surprises us at times as well..  Life is inconceivable. It offers challenges.. And&nbsp;I believe,&nbsp;that's what that makes our live so unpredictable. So unfold.    urlLink     what a peaceful PEACE on beach..&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;

      One chaotic question that lingered in my mind for quite some time is that why do we have to face fears, anxieties, discoveries, confusion, hesitation... and all. I know, this is a way of life. Life's like that, but why do we get it? We asked for those, I reckon.  Pressure and stress..are part of those as well. We have to get rid of those..as we, human beings cannot avoid stress despite the fact that prolonged stress can be harmful. That is detrimental to our health which is why we need to hang out. Yay..I love hanging out...shopping..even window shopping!! yeah.. Yet most importantly, no music, no life!! I'm soo into Hanson recently..sighh..wow..I have soo many idols..couldnt even list all of them here..you name it!!!!  Back to the topic, hesitation and doubts..*blushing*..are somewhat the feelings I cant runaway from..I dont know why..but, I'm a Libran though..hehe..Librans are mostly indecisive..I've gotten better though, I can make my own decision latterly.. Hopefully, it'll last long...  Hope.

       urlLink    britney...&nbsp; urlLink     The song, Everytime seems to melt thousands of people's heart. Maybe that's because it says something related to their soul..their indescribable feelings..I'm not excluded. Without a doubt, The Reason by Hoobastank has become my favourite. I play it every day..not being exaggerated, I turned on my CD player for that song every morning when I'm putting my school's uniform on!!

      I was having a nice nap, but I think that dream was a mess. I kinda remember what happened to my body and soul in the dream, but never hoped that to be happened in real life. The reality. Reality will overcome it.  Wake up from dreams are something dangerous, you'll never know whether the dream that you have just dreamt of will happen to you, sometimes you wish it would, of course. Put aside the thought at the moment, it's difficult and wake up! Wake up to reality, never looked back to the past; there are more interesting stuffs that worth your concern.   My dream was one thing really bad, wish it never happened. Gotta live through it, without fear. Come on.

      I dont know what I am going through now, and I dont know what I want all these years. Is it just a better result? There's no point when we struggle so hard all these years doing homework and revision and when we've grown up, all that you're doing right now is useless.  No one can predict the future, that's really true. No time wasting to hope for the better things to come to us, we gotta appreciate things happening to us, who knows if anything will happen to us in next few seconds.  I'm feeling numb. I'm coming back to no one every day, I feel so lonely. Everybody's busy doing their things. I have my own things to worry about too, just that maybe I've spent too much time thinking, and leads me to the wrong path. No one's there to correct it and point it out for me. I'm losing my way, hesitating. Friends do help, but not all the time, dude.  I'm tired of it.

      Here goes again:  Turn ons  Libra needs peace and harmony in all their relationship so help them maintain that. Venus the ruling planet gives them beauty and they have weakness for people who can compliment them about their beauty (you will not have to make an effort to do that anyway). You can help Libra seek union and partnership in life. If you have Libra partner you can be sure to share beautiful and pleasurable moments together.    Turn offs  Libra is kind and gentle soul but very argumentative. Hence do not start an argument or discussion unless of course you are free and do not know how to pass your time. They hate to lose and most probably in between of discussion they may change their side too (remember scales can tilt) and still continue arguing from other side. Do not push your Libra partner into making decisions. They will keep weighing pros and cons and may still not be able to come to any decision. Have patience!     urlLink    Libra &nbsp; urlLink

      Wasted another saturday again.  Sitting by my desk, I wish to finish off my additional mathematic tasks just now. Failed again. I lifted my white flag to my darling and dived into it, my bed. It's my best accompany but it can cause a vigorous person to mutate into a lethargic person.  Sometimes I do things that I regret. I try hard to cover that particular thing although it doesnt affect me much and yet I fail to do it, sometimes. I find reasons for myself to make myself comfortable again. Time seems to play a trick on us. If you want something, it flows by or vice versa. I believe that's what that makes our life so interesting.  The worst is never over coz another worse thing is waiting for us everyday. I wake up in the mornings, look into the mirror, wonder what will happen next. Everything that I expected wont seem to be, it turns out to be another totally unexpected thing instead. I tell myself not to expect things as expected things will never happen. Obviously, I dont allow myself to expect the positive things; afraid the bad will come.I am extremely conscious that thinking this way is unhealthy, so no expectations for me.I do aim high for better achievement, this is better, you know, just aim.  Life is beautiful. Smile to the world and live with it, my pal.

      I saw something from the net just now and below are the things I have found to describe me. Do you guys think it's accurate or is it just crap? No fear, tell me straightout and be frank of course. No pressure, just honestly.  Here goes:  You are mysterious, never selfish and get interested in things easily. Your day can be sad or happy depending on your mood. You are popular between friends but you can act stupid at times, and forget things easily. You go for person that's trustworthy.    Cheers.

      I dont know what happened to me these days, always being misunderstood by someone. I mean, friends and teachers. I didnt happen to fightback, as in tell them the truth. Just let it be, they will understand me someday, I thought. As a student, it's better if we dont mess with the teachers. Dont you think so?  Everyone grows up with misunderstandings. I learnt a lot from those though. We've gotta give in to avoid arguments. Peace finds harmony.   "Magnanimous people have no vanity, they have no jealousy, they have no reserves, and they feed on the true and solid wherever they find it. And what is more, they find it everywhere." -Van Wyck Brooks
