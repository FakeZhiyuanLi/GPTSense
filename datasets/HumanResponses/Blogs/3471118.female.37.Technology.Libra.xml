       urlLink PROV 2, 16-22 :  16 It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words, 17 who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God. 18 For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. 19 None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.  20 Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous. 21 For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; 22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.   The "It" that will save you also, is wisdom.  (From a few lines above the start of this passage.)  While the learning Bible explains this in a much more literal way, the adulteress and wayward wife being unfaithful, immoral women who ignore their marriage vows or are prostitutes, the "land" being Israel, promised by God to descendents of Abraham, I can't relate things that way to my life.  So it makes more sense to me to view these passages in a more figurative way...  Don't let anyone draw you away from God with "seductive" words, things they say to make sinful things seem attractive and worth doing.  Have the wisdom to know what is right and to follow what God wants you to do.  Going down that path (of sin) leads to death, and no one who does that is going to have the eternal life promised by God.  Do what he wants you to do, be a good person, stick to the right path, and you'll have everything promised by God, including an eternal life with him in Heaven.  Don't do that, and you're basically screwed.

      Okay, I survived baptism, and other than the beginnings of a panic attack (which I was able to fend off) nothing went horribly wrong.  A few tears, but no drowning, no flailing, no embarrassing moments (besides the crying in front of strangers thing... ugh) -- and except for when it was all over and it seemed half the church was commenting on how terrified I looked.  I'm just glad it's done and went better than I expected.  Thank God for Bobby bringing me to the pool to practice yesterday!  If not for that, things most definitely would not have gone smoothly.  In fact, they wouldn't have gone at all.  I wouldn't have been able to do it.   urlLink Bible Gateway : MATT 7, 1-5 :   1 "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. 3 Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."   Fairly obvious, this one.  Don't be a hypocrite and go around judging other people unless you're perfect yourself.  However you judge someone, you're going to be judged in the same way, and with the same harshness, yourself.  If you have things you need to change about yourself, your own sins, shortcomings, etc., don't go judging other people about theirs unless and until you've taken care of your own.  I think I'm doing a lot better with this, actually, and trying to be less judgmental about people.  I especially never want to come off as holier-than-thou, so I think I'm really trying hard to keep my own issues in mind before I jump on someone else's.  I'm not perfect, but I do think I'm getting better, so... that's a good thing I guess.

       urlLink LUKE 15, 3-7 :   3 Then Jesus told them this parable: 4 'Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.' 7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.   We're the lost sheep, God is the shepherd.  He's gone out searching for us, and when he finds us it's a joyful thing.  It's a lot easier to rejoice over finding something you lost than it is to rejoice over something you always had and never lost.  You appreciate those things that much more.  So when God goes looking for us, and finds us, and we go with him, it makes him much happier than it would if we'd never been lost in the first place.  Maybe this explains why he made us sinners to begin with?

       urlLink Bible Gateway : JOHN 16, 7-11 :   7 But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 8 When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt[1] in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: 9 in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me; 10 in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; 11 and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.   A little confusing, the learning Bible wasn't as much help as it usually is.  It's a little hard to see the relevance to my life here.  It seems to be more just general information Jesus was providing.  Maybe I'm not understanding it completely.  He's saying that unless he "went away" (died on the cross? ascended into heaven?) the Holy Spirit would not come to the disciples, so it was for their good that he was going away.  When the Holy Spirit came, he would rule the world to be guilty of sin, because people in the world did not believe in Jesus.  They would be found guilty in righteousness (and again, I hate that word, it really persists in having no meaning to me) because Jesus was going to heaven with God and wouldn't be able to be physically "seen" anymore (and maybe because of my aversion to the word "righteousness" I don't really understand this verse).  And they would be found guilty in judgment because Jesus was judged and condemned to death when he didn't do anything wrong.  (The learning Bible says this verse refers to the defeat of Satan -- I'm not seeing or getting that.)  So basically, I don't understand most of this.  What I do get from it is that Jesus had to die in order for God to give us his Holy Spirit, which is what allows Jesus to continue to live in us.  And anyone who doesn't have the Holy Spirit is going to be found guilty of their sin, judged, and condemned.  I think that's what I get from it, anyway.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : JOHN 15, 15-24 :   "15 I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.  17 This is my command: Love each other.  18 If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 20 Remember the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 21 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. 23 He who hates me hates my Father as well. 24 If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.   Longer than usual because I'm catching up on two days worth.  Again, I've gotten behind, and away from doing this on a daily basis.  I want to keep up with that.  Even in just the 31 days I did it with the church verses, going back and reading them over has helped me at times.  We aren't just serving God -- we have a relationship with him where he has let us in on the "secrets" of life.  He's chosen us to do his works, specifically to spread his word to other people and try to bring them closer to him.  If we do this, God will listen to our prayers and help us out when we need it.  All we have to do is love each other.  There's going to be opposition to us, even hatred of us, because we are Christians.  That's the same as it was when Jesus was here -- they hated him too.  We aren't owned by the world, we belong to God, so the world doesn't understand us and therefore might hate us.  (I don't think this is a given in general, just a possibility we have to be prepared for.)  The world isn't going to treat us any better than it treated Jesus, and we have to be ready to deal with that.  But in the same way, people in the world might listen to what we have to say -- like me listening to Bobby and the pastors and learning about Christianity.  However they respond to you, it will be because of Jesus, and because these people don't know God.  And if they continue to not know God, it won't be (and shouldn't be) because no one told them about him.  We should give them the opportunity to know him, but with that also comes responsibility if they continue to choose not to know him.  That sounds so harsh.  But I guess it's true.  I don't ever want to come off sounding holier-than-thou, though.  "Well, if you don't believe in God, it's your own fault when you die and go to hell!"  What a horrible way to approach things with people!  I understand the concept here.  But if I were ever going to tell anyone about God and Jesus, I would really not want it to be that way.  Maybe that is the truth, and maybe it will be the end result, and maybe they do need to hear that and realize it.  But it's not exactly a good way to get people to come over to this side, you know?

       urlLink Bible Gateway : DEUT 28, 11-13 :  11 The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity- in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground- in the land he swore to your forefathers to give you. 12 The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. 13 The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.   More of God's promises...  He will make us prosperous in our lives (using examples more relevant to the times, but also applicable to our lives today).  We will be blessed in everything that we do in God's name.  We will have enough to loan to others, but won't need to borrow from anyone.  God will put us first, not last.  If we do God's will, do the things he wants us to do, we will always be on top, not at the bottom.  God will take care of us.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : ISAIAH 58, 9-11 :   9 Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.  "If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk, 10 and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday. 11 The LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.   A continuation of a previous Isaiah reading, and says very similar things.  Pray to God and he will answer you. Ask him for help and he will provide it.  I think the "yoke of oppression" is supposed to be our sinful nature, so do away with that, don't be accusatory or judgmental toward other people, don't talk maliciously about them, spread rumors, or gossip, take care of people who need it -- people who are hungry or who need someone to stand up for them -- do all that and we'll be able to show the world what it means to be Christian, how our "light" (through Jesus) shines from the inside out.  God will guide us to where we need to be and will take care of our needs for us.  We'll have strength and we'll be able to flourish in whatever we try to do.  More good things to remember about how to behave, what to do, and how God will take care of us if we do these things.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : JONAH 2, 5-9 :  5 The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 6 To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you brought my life up from the pit, O LORD my God.  7 'When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.  8 'Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs. 9 But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD.'   No matter how bad it gets, God will still protect and save you, as long as you remember him and continue to pray to him. Don't worship idols instead of God and give up all that he can provide to you. Worship God and he will give you salvation.  I still have a hard time with the story of Jonah, accepting it as literal truth. But whether it is or isn't, the message is the same. It really doesn't matter how hard things get, even being close to death.  God is going to be there to protect you and save you.  You just have to keep worshiping him, and praying to him, and he'll give you salvation.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : EPH 4, 1-6 :  1 As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit-- just as you were called to one hope when you were called-- 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.   As Christians, we should live our lives in a way that lives up to the expectations God has for us now *because* we are Christians. We should be humble and gentle with each other. We should be patient with each other, and we should show love to each other (which helps us to be humble and gentle and patient).  We should try to keep things peaceful (the learning Bible says, "Keep the unity, which God produced through the reconciling death of Christ. It is the heavy responsibility of Christians to keep that unity from being disturbed."  I don't really understand this, but I think it means to keep the holy spirit close to us, the way it was when it first came to us from Jesus' death. But I really don't know if that's right, it seems very confusing.).  We need to remember that there is one God, one son, one spirit, and one hope - which is in them. There is just one God and Lord and Father and he is everywhere, in everything and in everyone.  This was really a little confusing to me (I don't like Paul's writing very much, it never seems clear to me) but I think it's just basically telling us how we should be interacting with other people now that we are Christians -- with patience and kindness and gentleness and love, upholding the expectations and responsibility that comes with being Christian and setting the example for others.  And do all of this remembering where our hope lies, and that God is in control of everything.  And if that is what the passage is saying, then it's something I know I need to remember, and I hope I'm doing better with that.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : MATT 12, 46-50 :  46 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. 47 Someone told him, 'Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.' 48 He replied to him, 'Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?' 49 Pointing to his disciples, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers. 50 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.'   Pretty self-explanatory I think.  Jesus wasn't rejecting his mother and brothers, he was just making a point, that Christians (people who do God's will, followers of Jesus) are all brothers, sisters, family as children of God.  Not much more, really to say about this one.

He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty."   Jesus is pointing out that it was God who provided the manna from heaven, and not Moses, but that God is providing something even better -- Jesus, so that we can have eternal life with him in heaven.  Jesus came down from heaven and gave life to the world, and living in him, believing in him, will give us eternal life, free from hunger or thirst.  Basic concepts to remember and believe in.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : PROV 26, 20-28 :  20 Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down.  21 As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.  22 The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts.  23 Like a coating of glaze over earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart.  24 A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but in his heart he harbors deceit. 25 Though his speech is charming, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart. 26 His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.  27 If a man digs a pit, he will fall into it; if a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on him.  28 A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruin.   The learning Bible was little help here, just sending me all over the place to read other verses in other parts of the Bible that were supposed to be similar. But, I think it's fairly easy to get the general gist of the passage, even if some of the language doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Basically, God doesn't like gossips, people who talk badly about other people, who spread rumors or lies, are deceitful, or who cause rifts between people.  Without gossip, an argument won't have as much fuel to continue.  But people who enjoy causing arguments, who enjoy spreading gossip, add fuel to the fire.  Their words get taken to heart, and can be very damaging to those listening, and to the person spreading the gossip too.  They may try to cover up what they're doing with a fake smile and throwing in occasional compliments, to make it sound like they aren't really saying or doing anything wrong, but they are being deceitful.  Eventually, it will come back to bite him, though.  They will be exposed for what they are doing, and whatever they have done will come back and be done to them.  People who lie and spread rumors hate the people they are hurting, and covering up what they are doing by acting all nice about it just makes it worse.  I have known so many people who were like this.  Trish is like this.  She will spread lies and rumors about people she doesn't like, and do it in a way that makes it seem so harmless, like she's just repeating something she heard or whatever.  I really can't stand that aspect of her, she used to do it at Armstrong all the time, and she still does it.  That's beside the point, though.  God doesn't like people who do this, so we should be really careful about what we say, pay attention to whether things we say can hurt someone, and be careful not to spread gossip or perpetuate rumors others may have started.  I'm glad I'm over the whole gossip thing, but I still need to be careful about it.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : ROM 15, 1-7 :  1 We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. 2 Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. 3 For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: 'The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.' 4 For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. 5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus, 6 so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 7 Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God."   As Christians, we should bear with people who aren't there yet, who don't know about God, and not put them down or criticize them to make ourselves feel better or greater-than-thou.  We should be encouraging other people, being nice to them and making them feel good about themselves, and then they might be more open to hearing about what we believe.  Even Jesus did this, and when people had bad things to say against God, he took those insults on himself. Everything written in the Bible is there to teach us, so that we can have hope in God, and so we can show hope to others who don't know God yet.  We don't have to agree with everyone else, but we should accept them anyway, and love them anyway, the same way Jesus accepted us.  I probably interpreted this incorrectly, and read more into it than was there.  But it just seemed to be in line with what I was thinking, about how we're supposed to be, and act, and represent ourselves as Christians, not just to other Christians but to non-Christians too.  We are supposed to set an example of love and acceptance, the way Jesus did, and we should be reading and learning from the Bible so we can teach other people too.  So even if I'm off-base with what with passage was specifically referring to, I still think that's a good lesson to keep in mind.

He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives.  7 'But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. 8 He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.'   Don't try to get through life on your own, putting your trust in your own abilities or things in the world around you. You won't be very successful and will have a lot of adversity to deal with as a result.  Put your trust in God and trust him to help you through your life.  He will not only help you but will make you successful and prosperous.  You'll be able to live without any fear, knowing that he's going to be taking care of you.  Like the previous reading, this is just a good thing for me to remember in general. Putting my trust in anyone isn't the easiest thing to do and the fact that it's God doesn't make it much better, although I know it should.  I am doing better about it, but keeping this in mind will help a lot with that.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : MATT 5, 43-48 :  43 You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies  and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.   This makes a lot of sense to me. It's easy to love the people who love you, anyone can do that.  It's a lot harder to show love to people who hate you, or who you hate. Doing that is what really shows that you are the kind of Christian who can be an example to other people, because it is so hard to do and so against our human nature and instinct. But doing that will show other people what it really means to be a Christian -- far more than the fire and brimstone condemnation of everyone who isn't a Christian that so many "Christians" demonstrate to the world.  We'll never be able to reach that level of perfection that is the standard set for us, but that doesn't mean we can't try for it.

If you live in God (as a Christian), he will give you protection. You can trust in God to give you strength and to keep your safe from harm.  You don't have to be afraid of worldly threats, like attacks from enemies, diseases, etc.  God is going to keep you safe and what happens in this life isn't going to matter to the eternal life God will give you.  This is another way to look at my fears.  It seems like over and over again there are things in the Bible that talk about how you don't have to be afraid because God will protect you.  I'm doing better with my fears, but it would really help to be able to remember this more often than I do.

The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.'   Because we love God, we'll do what he asks of us. (In return?) he will give us the holy spirit to be with us until Jesus returns. The spirit brings us to truth (the truth about God, about Jesus, about the Bible) but many people in the world will never accept it because they don't have faith in God.  Since we do have faith, the spirit will live with us and inside us.  We won't be left alone until Jesus comes back because he will be with us through the spirit.  That's kind of a nice thing to remember.  I wish I did remember it more often.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : JAS 5, 7-9 :  7 Be patient, then, brothers, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. 8 You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near. 9 Don't grumble against each other, brothers, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!   I am so far behind in my Bible readings it isn't even funny.  I have a feeling this is one I should have read the whole chapter to understand. We are supposed to be patient -- for what, I'm not sure, maybe Jesus' return, maybe with people who we don't get along with, maybe just in general.  Jesus will be returning to earth, and when he does he'll take care of judging people.  We don't have to do that now, we don't have to be angry with each other or judge each other.  We can be patient in the knowledge that when Jesus comes back, he'll take care of all that.  I have no idea if I'm even close on this one...

       urlLink Bible Gateway : ISA 58, 6-9a :  6 'Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? 7 Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter- when you see the naked, to clothe him, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? 8 Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. 9 Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.   Another hard one...  Work toward eliminating injustice and oppression in the world.  Give food to the hungry and shelter and clothes to people who need them.  Don't turn away from your family when they need you.  (Basically do what God wants you to do?)  Then your light will shine through you from the inside out (like the previous verses that talked about this) and you'll be healed (spiritually?).  God will protect you, with your faith (there's that word "righteousness" again...) going ahead of you and God coming behind you to protect you and keep you safe.  When you need help, God will answer and will help you.  The learning Bible made this so much harder than it had to be because it kept going into the historical aspects of whatever was going on at the time and taking the verses literally to apply to the history.  It's a lot easier when you just look at the verses as instructions of how to be a better Christian, and promises from God of what he'll do for you if you do what he asks of you.  I guess it wasn't that hard after all.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : 1 COR 15, 51-55 :  51 Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed-- 52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 54 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: 'Death has been swallowed up in victory. 55 Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?'   I don't like how Paul writes. His stuff is always hard for me to make sense out of, and the learning Bible isn't much help.  Not all Christians are going to experience death, but we will all be changed in an instant at the end of the world when Jesus comes back.  He'll sound a trumpet and the people who have died will be raised, and Christians' bodies will change from mortal to immortal.  Then a saying (a prophesy?) will come true, and Christians will be victorious over death.  Death won't be victorious, and will have no sting, because we will have our immortal and imperishable bodies for eternity.  This is like what the pastor was talking about a couple of Sundays ago, about what will happen when Jesus returns.  I didn't realize that was going to result in us having physical bodies in heaven.  I thought it was just a spiritual thing.  I wonder what happens to people who get cremated, then.  I don't guess it matters, though, God can still give them their bodies back.

      This is my worst nightmare...  I don't want to go to the dentist, so I put it off and put it off until something is wrong and I'm forced to go.  I damn near need a valium just to get in the door.  My stomach is fluttering, my palms are sweating, and I'd do just about anything to get out of there.  I would leave, but I need to know what's wrong so I stay.  The whole place seems dark and ominous.  No one seems to enjoy their jobs very much -- no one is smiling or friendly, they all seem to want to get out of there as much as I do.  I'm taken back to the room but they won't let Bobby come with me.  (I'd actually walk out of a place that did that, but for the sake of the nightmare, Bobby can't come in with me.)  So I have to sit back there alone waiting for Dr. Sadist to show up.  When he does, he's very somber and morose, unfriendly, unsmiling, just as miserable as everyone else in the place.  He looks at me like I'm a nutcase for being afraid to be there.  He's very matter-of-fact about the whole thing -- you need to get your teeth checked, no one likes it, you just do it, so suck it up.  He doesn't understand my fears at all.  He's very swift and doesn't take the time to let me know what he's doing.  He gets annoyed by me hesitating to open my mouth for him.  When I finally do, he starts right in with no preamble or explanation.  He's got that pointy thing they use and he's poking around all over my teeth and gums.  He doesn't talk to me while he's doing this at all.  He doesn't seem to have any empathy about what he's doing, either, he's just poking at me without a care in the world.  He's cutting into my gums, making me bleed, letting me rinse only when he needs to see better.  He doesn't think my TMJ should hinder me from keeping my mouth open for two hours straight while he pokes and prods around in my mouth.  When he's done looking around he says I need a lot of work done.  I have cavities that need to be drilled, I have to have a root canal, need my wisdom teeth pulled, and he's going to do it all right then.  He pulls out a needle the size of my arm and sticks it into my gums without even telling me he's going to do it.  I was going to ask him to use the spray-on novacaine first to numb the shot a little, but I didn't get a chance to ask before he just did it.  It's excruciating but he doesn't seem to notice.  It's supposed to be numbing my mouth but I can still feel stuff.  I try to tell him that but he doesn't listen.  He says it takes a minute to kick in and it'll be fine in a while.  So he starts with the drill.  That is the most miserable feeling in the world.  My whole mouth is vibrating from it, it starts hitting a nerve in my tooth and the pain is horrible.  I start to squirm around because of it and his hand slips and the drill hits my mouth.  Now I'm bleeding and have a hole where there isn't supposed to be one.  He tells me to sit still and keeps going.  He's working very fast, like he's rushed and just wants to finish the job, annoyed by how much there is to do.  The drilling hurts, but the filling is finally done.  Without giving me a minute to catch my breath and relax a bit, he starts in on the root canal.  I've never had one before so I don't know exactly what's involved, but I know it hurts like a bitch.  Then he grabs these big clamp-like things and latches them on to my wisdom tooth and just starts pulling.  It makes me sick to my stomach, the pain is so bad, the feeling of him wiggling my tooth around until it starts to loosen, and then he's in there with that pokey thing again trying to pry the tooth out.  I feel like I want to pass out.  This happens three more times with the rest of the wisdom teeth.  When he's finally finished, he wants to give me a cleaning.  As if I'm not sore enough, he starts in with the scrapy thing, and then the buffer thing, and they're hitting all the work he's just done and rubbing against the sore spots, but he doesn't care, he just keeps going.  He finishes with the cleaning and tells me I can go.  He's got this twisted little smirk on his face while he's writing up the paperwork, which comes to a couple thousand dollars.  I feel miserable and it's a week before I can eat solid foods again.  My jaw aches, I have bruises around my mouth, and I think I'll be waiting another ten years or so before I go through this nightmare again.

      So I'm scared to death about going to the dentist, but I make myself just do it.  I have to keep reminding myself that I need to be there, that it'll be over soon, that there's only so much he can do to hurt me, and that Bobby will be there with me.  It doesn't really help, but at least it gets me in the door.  I'm taken back and have to sit in the chair, waiting and nervous.  The dentist comes in and seems to be understanding of my fears about being there.  He tells me he isn't going to do anything without letting me know first and he'll try to be as pain-free as possible.  He's obviously trying to calm me down and relax me.  It takes a while to get me to open my mouth, but he says he won't do anything, he just wants to look with his mirror.  He pokes around in there for a while and is being pretty good about letting me know what he's doing so I can stay relaxed.  He doesn't find anything wrong and says I just need a cleaning.  No cavities to fill or root canals to perform, nothing major.  I hate getting my teeth cleaned and start to get worked up again, but he's doing what he can to talk to me and keep me calm.  Bobby being there, talking to me, encouraging me, and telling me it's okay is helping.  I like knowing he's there and keeping an eye on things.  So I let him do the cleaning.  It's uncomfortable and it hurts to keep my mouth open that wide for that long, but he lets me rest my jaw when I need to.  The scraping makes me bleed and I hate that taste, but I can rinse and it goes away.  I hate the sound it makes too.  There's music playing so I try to concentrate on that instead.  His hand doesn't slip and he doesn't cut into my gums or anything so it isn't too bad.  When it's finally over I'm really relieved to be getting out of there.  I won't have to come back for a while, and at least I know I could get through it.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : 2 COR 3, 13-16 :  13 We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away. 14 But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 15 Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. 16 But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.   Refers back to the Exodus verses from a day or so back.  The difference is that for Moses and the old covenant with God, the radiance faded so he covered his face so no one would see it.  With the new covenant with Jesus, the radiance does not fade, so the veil is not needed.  So when you become a Christian, that veil is taken away, so everyone can see the radiance that shines through you because of God.  At least, I think that's how I understand things, from the learning Bible.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : EXOD 34, 29-35 :  29 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD. 30 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him. 31 But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them. 32 Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai. 33 When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face. 34 But whenever he entered the LORD's presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, 35 they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.   Most of this just seems like a historical recounting of events.  The one thing I think I can take from it is the part about Moses being radiant after speaking with God.  The learning Bible says he put the veil over his face so the Israelites wouldn't see the radiance fading, and then took it off to speak with God and became radiant again.  I think that parallels the verse a couple of posts back in John about the light shining through you when you are doing what God wants you to do.  It's the same light, the same radiance, that comes from the inside out when you are close to God.  It's what Bobby has that people can see when they interact with him.  It's the radiance that you get when you're close to God.  I think it's the same thing here, and it's another example of how God can change you from the inside out.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : LUKE 21, 1-4 :  1 As he looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. 2 He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. 3 'I tell you the truth,' he said, 'this poor widow has put in more than all the others. 4 All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.'   Giving things you can easily afford to give isn't sacrificing anything.  When you give of yourself, or give things that are costly to you, that means more than a gift you have no problem affording.  This is hard for me because I don't agree with tithing to a church or giving huge amounts of money.  I much prefer to give in ways that make a difference, like volunteering or taking on some role that is helpful to people.  Giving of my time and energy, of my abilities and talents, of my internal resources, of my intellect, are more of a sacrifice to me because I value my time and privacy so much.  Giving monetarily is okay, and I like to give to charities, and I like to contribute to the church.  But giving so much that it hurts our ability to live and eat, as I'm assuming the woman in this passage did, isn't something that agrees with me.  I don't have the constitution for it.  I don't know if that's wrong, but it's how I feel.

God has a purpose, and it isn't going to be thwarted.  Rain and snow come down from heaven, nourish the earth, and create food for eating and profit -- it has a purpose.  God's word is the same way.  He's not just putting it out there for no reason, he's giving it to us so that we can do what he wants us to do with it.  That purpose is going to be achieved, it's not going to be thwarted.  And his purpose is for us to have inner joy and peace, knowing the truth of God's word, and to spread the message to other people.  All of God's creation will benefit (and rejoice?) from our doing what God wants of us.  It's good to remember that God has a plan, and it's going to be followed to the end, exactly the way he wants it to, and nothing that we or anyone else does can stop that.  That gives me some confidence to know that I don't have to be in control of every little thing.  What God wants to have happen is going to happen, and what he wants not to happen, won't.  I just need to trust in him and do my part, which is what he wants of me.

       urlLink Bible Gateway : JOHN 3, 19-21 :  19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.   I think Jesus is supposed to be the Light that came into the world, and represents goodness.  But people, having human nature and the inclination to sin, love darkness (sin) instead.  People like the sinful things they do, usually because it brings them some kind of physical pleasure or comfort, or lets them be selfish with their needs and wants.  But if you live this way and love your sins, you are rejecting God and Jesus and you'll never "come into the light" (the realization of the truth?) because then you'd have to face up to your sins and change how you live your life.  If you live your life by God's word, knowing the truth, you'll come into the light (be plain and obvious to everyone?) and it will be clear to others that the things you do are because of God.  I think this is how Bobby is and has been.  He's lived his life as a Christian, and because of that he shines in a way that very few people I've ever known have.  You can see there's something special in him, and when you ask him about it, he tells you -- it's because of God.  I think that's an example of what living your life by and through God will do.  It is so plain and obvious, and he's been such a good example of Christianity.  No, he's not perfect, no one is, and I don't expect him to be.  The point is that he tries to be, and you can see him from the inside out.  It's so plain and so clear that there's something special going on inside of him.  That's the kind of example I want to be.  Maybe someday I'll get there.

If you can help someone who needs it, do it.  Don't put off helping someone who needs it if you can help them now.  Get along with your neighbors, with those around you, who have no reason to distrust or suspect you - don't blindside them with something that can hurt them for no reason.  Don't lay down judgments and make accusations as a third-party observer.  If someone has done you no harm, leave them alone.  Don't be violent, or appreciate violence.  That would go against God.  Do what God wants you to do and you'll be part of his family and have a close relationship with him.  The helping others who need it part is something I've been thinking about more often.  I would love to be able to do something that helps people for a living -- I mean, really helps people, who have immediate needs, not in some obscure arms-length sort of way.  Bobby and I briefly talked about foster parenting, but I'm not sure that's right for me, for the same reasons I haven't been sure about parenting my own child.  I know there's something out there that I can and should be doing.  It'll come to me, and I hope that when it does, I act on it the way I'm supposed to.

Because of his wisdom, God was able to create the world knowing perfectly well how it would have to work.  He made the entire earth, the oceans, streams, and rivers, and the sky, clouds, and rain.  It was his wisdom that allowed him to know exactly how to make the world.  We should use our wisdom too, to make sound decisions, using our best judgment at all times.  We should always keep those things in the front of our minds so we can make our decisions based on what God would want us to do.  Then we can be safe and secure that we are going down the right path, without fear or stress or concerns.  We'll be able to sleep well at night knowing everything is in order.  Another way to look at the "God takes care of the details" thing.  I just need to make sure I'm on the right path -- using my best judgment and wisdom based on what I'm learning in the Bible is the way I should be living my life -- and everything else will work itself out.  I don't need to be afraid or have fears of the future, where I'm going to end up career-wise, whether I'm making the right decisions on a job, all of that.  It will work out.  God will handle the details.  And he's guiding me along anyway.  So I can take a deep breath and relax.

Two days worth because, again, I'm playing catch-up...  Remember the things the Bible teaches and the things God wants of you. Put them into action and he'll reward you with a long and prosperous life.  Keep love and faithfulness to God close to your heart so you don't forget them or God and can keep him a priority in your life.  Trust God, his promises, and his teaching -- don't rely on your own worldview or beliefs or understanding of life, rely on what you know from what the Bible says.  That way you can stay on the right path, and that too will give you a long, healthy, and prosperous life.  Honor God, live the life he wants you to live, and you'll receive blessings beyond measure.  If you start to have bad times, don't show resentment toward God.  He might be trying to teach you something, but it's being done with love, the way a parent loves a child.  If you can remember all this and have the wisdom and understanding of God's teaching, you'll have a long, prosperous, and blessed life.  Part of this reminds me of what you hear all the time about people who go out of their way to help other people.  People who always give of themselves, who everyone knows they can count on and trust to come through.  Those people always seem to be the most loved, and when they have hard times and need people to come through for them, the response is overwhelming.  I think that's part of what these passages are saying.  Do what God wants you to do, stay on the right path, show love to him and to other people, and the reward -- either from God or from those around you (which is also from God, really) is going to be more than you could imagine.

      Every time I think about this trip, my stomach gets knotted up. There is so much to think about, so much to do. We don't have an itinerary, not even any real concept of how long it will take us to drive there. We have to rent a car, find hotels along the way that take dogs, make reservations, make sure we can get to these places in a reasonable time frame. We have to find a hotel to stay in while we're there, make those reservations. Bobby needs his tux, I need my dress. Then there's all the crap you have to do when you go on a trip - cancel mail and newspapers, turn off the water, get someone to keep an eye on the place, rotate lights, etc., make sure no food will spoil while we're gone, make sure bills are paid, shows are recorded, computers are powered down. Pack. For me, for Bobby, for the dog, for a two week trip, so much stuff to pack. Medicines, phone numbers, the laptop. So so so so so much to do.  And then my fears about what could happen while we're gone. The dog getting hurt, Bobby getting sick, being a thousand miles or more from home, from our doctors, from anyone who can help. Something happening back here, an emergency, someone breaking into the house, a fire, a flood. I don't know how to manage any of that from Minnesota. I need a list of hospitals, vets, emergency clinics out there, phone numbers of neighbors here. If something goes wrong... I don't even want to think about it. My anxiety is building just writing this.
