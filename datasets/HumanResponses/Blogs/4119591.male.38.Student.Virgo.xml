      I know, I know. This movie came out like 200 years ago, but I finally just saw it.  I had been avoiding it because I just knew I was going to dislike it or that it would be seriously weak. I liked it and it wasn't even slightly weak.  So, normally what I would do at a time like this is run out and tell all of my friends (both of them) to see  urlLink this film  right away, but I won't because I'm apparently the last person on earth to see it.  Decent flick. Go  urlLink rent  it... again.

      The  urlLink news  today is a-buzz about a controversial Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law against sodomy.  Texas prosecutors had argued that the state was entitled to regulate public morality and that bans on homosexual acts were a longstanding U.S. legal tradition.   Seems to me that if Texas really wants to uphold "traditional family values," it should start by cracking down on heterosexual acts outside of marriage. ...but that would ruin the lives of too many politicians, now wouldn't it?

      I received an update today from the Social Security Administration. The notice listed out how much money I've made over the years and how much of that was collected from me and my employers.  At the bottom, in bold, not-so-friendly letters it read:  Your estimated benefits are based on current law. Congress has made changes to the law in the past and can do so at any time. The law governing benefit amounts may change because, by 2042, the payroll taxes collected will be enough to pay only about 73 percent of scheduled benefits.  Let's see... I'll be in my mid-to-late-seventies in 2042. Kids will be playing their darned holographs too loud and no one will give me a place to sit on the space bus. To top it off, I'll have to use the money I've been shashing away since I was 25 because the money that has been taken from me since I was 15 will be exhausted.  Am I outraged? No. One of two things will happen, I'm guessing:   The next few generations yet to be born will be asked (or told) to support us Gen-Xers.   The next few generations yet to be born will get fed up with us old codgers and make us into house pets.   I don't care either way. As long as they turn their music down.

      When I first saw "the web," I was working for a hi-tech company. A co-worker of mine dropped by my cubicle all excited about this new thing he had seen. He was talking about the NSCA Mosaic HTTP browser. I don't remember what version we had running, but it was UNIX-based and displayed through Xwindows of some flavor. Stones, knives and bear skins by today's standards.  The first site I saw featured  urlLink LEGO  products. It might have been put up by the corporation or it might have been made by an enthusiast of the little plastic blocks but, whichever it was, I wasn't impressed. I thought, "What good is this? What would anyone use this for?" ...Such brilliant insight helps to explain why I'm not a multi-gazillionare today.  I created my first web site in about 1996, if memory serves. A local ISP offered all of the necessary and (at the time) cutting edge tools for creating and serving web content. By this time I was beginning to "get it," although I still saw the web as some kind of geeky toy. Just being able to do something that many of my friends could not brought its own taped-glasses, laugh-snorting, nerdy pleasure.  I taught myself to write html (hyper-text markup language) from scratch and, later, to use tag-based authoring software and syntax checkers. Very slowly I was able to move away from the strict technical challenge of pages that said, "HEY I HAVE A WEB PAGE," to attempting interesting (to me, family members and friends anyway) content.  Nowadays it seems that everyone has a web page, everyone has listings of their favorite bands, everyone has pictures of their dogs and kids and motorcycles... why should I even try? Because, I never know who might be watching.  And so, it is for you -- whoever you are -- that I toil away at this self-congratulatory endeavor. Here's hoping that at least something here brings a smile or a nod or perhaps even sends you into a blind rage. As long as I get a reaction, I'm happy.  All the world is a stage... and it's your turn to sweep.

      As seen in the  urlLink CNN  news item entitled  urlLink Vatican fights gay marriages :   The Vatican issued a 12-page set of guidelines with the approval of Pope John Paul II in a bid to stem the increase in laws granting legal rights to homosexual unions in Europe and North America.  Yeah, the Church has made it clear over the years (particularly in recent years) that the only recognized Holy union is between a priest and his alter boy. According to the news report, it took the Vatican two years to draft the 12 page document ( urlLink link ). That's six pages a year! With such a slow transmission rate, I have to wonder why Heaven doesn't just cough up the $50 a month for DSL?

      The magic of Cable Television is a mysterious thing. Digital Cable Television is even more mysterious. Data compression and digital signal processing make it possible for the cable company to cram four or five channels of programming into the space where only one analog channel would otherwise go. Using this magic, it is now possible to have 500 stupid channels instead of just 90.  So there I was, watching one of my favorite stupid channels, when I noticed that the network didn't match up with the channel number. Channel 162 is supposed to be BBC America but instead I was seeing Professional Bull Riding on the Outdoor Life Network (OLN). I don't subscribe to OLN. Given a choice, I would rather beat my head against a wall than watch OLN.  I clicked to what was supposed to be TNN/Spike TV and got MTV-2 (also, not something to which I subscribe). CNN was Bravo, Bravo was Home Shopping, IFC was unavailable and so on. My world began crashing down around me. It was almost as if I couldn't trust what I saw on the screen.  There aren't too many things that a man in this day and age can call his own but I think that the bond between a male and his remote control is a sacred thing -- not to be trifled with. Take away that basic foundational relationship, and everything else falls away like a house of cards. Set adrift in a sea of uncertainty, I sought counseling and solace from the cable company customer service personnel.  After turning off, un-plugging, wiggling this, changing that, as instructed by the service representative to no avail, I was asked to bring the cable box in for repair or replacement. I'm going to do that today. I'm still a bit shaken, but I know that eventually all will be set right.  Occasionally we read about some apparently deranged individual walking into their place of work with a rifle, or about someone leaping out into traffic at a busy intersection and we have to ask ourselves: Is this person getting the quality Cable Television that they need? Could this tragedy have been prevented if only Lou Dobbs' MoneyLine had come in more clearly or if "Worlds Worst Drivers" had not been preempted by local advertisements? Perhaps we will never know, but paying attention to these societal pressures more closely may help us stave off loss and pain in the future.  Click.

      Tania and I went to see   urlLink Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines  last week. We rarely see films in the theater so it was a special treat to experience that for-real squeaky plastic chair and spilled soda under the feet environment that only a cinema movieplex can provide. But enough about that.  Terminator fans will find much to like here. However, I think newbie Terminator fans (those who have not yet seen parts one and two) will get lost quickly. John Connor (played well by Nick Stahl) is now in his early 20's; the doomsday date for earth has come and gone, thanks to the adventures that took place in  Terminator 2: Judgment Day . But just as we saw in that earlier film, the future is not set, and the arrival of two terminators from the future (one good and one bad) almost assures that the disaster of SkyNet will come to pass anyway.  Arnold's character is sent by humans back in time to protect John from the very blonde and very bad T-X (played by Kristanna Loken and a lot of computer magic). If you thought the T-1000 in the previous movie was flexible, wait until you see this new model!  As with the other films in this franchise, stuff blows up and all manner of unlikely things happen to our almost indestructible hero/villain Arnold "T-800" Schwarzenegger. This may come in handy for him should he decide to throw his hat into the California Governor Sweepstakes to be held later this year.  Allen and Tania give it 7 popcorn kernels out of 10. Go get in line right now.

      It would seem that my group at work did not win the Powerball lottery. The $263.1 million prize will be split between the Walkenbachs in Missouri and someone else in Pennsylvania.  An Associated Press  urlLink story  had this to say:  William Walkenbach, a production supervisor, said he wants to "finally get me a tractor with brakes." He will never be able to sell his old tractor now. Everyone in the world knows that the brakes don't work. Sheesh!

      In a  urlLink Reuters  story, we're told that Shelton "Spike" Jackson Lee has had a change of heart regarding the renaming of The National Network to Spike TV.   In a statement, Lee said he "no longer believes that Viacom deliberately intended to trade on my name when naming Spike TV."   One reason might be that  Spike isn't his name !  "As an artist and a filmmaker, I feel that protection of freedom of expression is a critical value, and I am concerned that my efforts to stop Viacom from using the Spike TV name could have the unintended consequence of threatening the First Amendment rights of Viacom and others," Lee said in a statement.   What a pile of dingo's kidneys. He's had this sudden turnabout because Viacom is going to give him some shows on MTV. The president of Spike TV, Albie Hecht, offered up this gem:  "Spike and Tonya Lee have a relationship with MTV Networks," Hecht said. "There are development situations that are in place that could potentially be broadened."   The Hecht with it. Somebody, please bring me a shovel. Conspiracy theorists might conclude that Viacom and Lee planned all of this to raise awareness (and financial opportunities) in both camps. So, by repeating all of it here, I might actually be helping their cause! You're welcome.  The terrorists are winning.

      The  urlLink PowerBall  lottery jackpot is estimated to be $250 million dollars and there is a drawing this evening. A group of us at work have pooled a few dollars between us to leverage our chances of winning something. This brings our odds to something approaching the odds of being struck by lightning while being crushed by a falling piano filled with circus clowns.  I don't normally play the lottery. A friend of mine likes to think of state and national lotteries as "taxes for people who do not understand statistical probability." But with the jackpot being so very high, it seems silly not to at least try.  There is another fantasy involved: Imagine everyone in my office resigning on the same day. "Smell ya' later!!!" That unlikely scenario is worth throwing away a dollar or two. Of course, I would continue to work for free just because I love what I do so very much.  There's nothing so compelling as becoming suddenly rich and enjoying all of the trappings: big houses, world travel, celebrity, law suits, excessive substance abuse, jail time. Yup, when I'm rich, I'll remember all of you fondly and perhaps even use my phone call after booking and fingerprinting to ask you for bail.

      Tania and I spent the 4th with my cousin Kathy and her family. In the tradition of our forefathers and formums, we snacked on hamburgers and hot dogs and then blew stuff up real good in the street in front of their house. A good time was had by all.    After the eating but before the blowing stuff up, I took all four of Kathy's kids and a friend of the family on motorcycle rides through the neighborhood. (Not all of them rode with me at once, mind you -- they went one at at time.) None of them had ever ridden on a motorcycle before... you never forget your first time. I rode on the back of my dad's bike when I was quite young.  I put about 40 miles on Maggie the Magna just by tooling around. The youngest girl, Jamie, wasn't at all sure she wanted to go once she got up next to the bike, so I took her around the block and then asked if she wanted to continue. She did. Because of a navigational mistake on my part, her ride ended up being longer than those I gave to her older brothers. She has promised not to gloat.  As a moto-pusher I'm happy to have shared my addiction with a few more people. The first one is always free. We get the kids hooked on our junk and then raise the price. ;-)  The Motorcycle Safty Foundation reminds you to "Start SEEING motorcycles." ...and if you like one of them enough, settle down and start a family.

      Just today I remembered that our former local cable modem monopoly had been replaced by another, larger, monopoly. The previous company had sent several notification messages about making changes to email clients and news reading programs so as to "not miss a single message."  The other thing I just remembered was that my cable modem account comes with an email address. I rarely check it and, when I do, the only mail there is from the cable company. So I checked my "old" account one last time and discovered that I had yet another message reminding me to switch. I gathered the new information, made the necessary changes to my mail client, and told it to check my "new" account.  I had three messages: The first was a welcome from the "new" cable monopoly and the other two were spam promising to change my physical dimensions in very graphic ways.  Neat. New email address and new spam. Eventually the thing will fill up with garbage and no longer accumulate new messages.

      Reuters carried a  urlLink story  this morning that quotes President Bush, (justifiably) fed up with recent attacks on US military forces station in Iraq, as taunting the attackers.  President Bush on Wednesday challenged militants who have been killing and injuring U.S. forces in Iraq, saying "bring them on" because American forces were tough enough to deal with their attacks.  I'm not qualified to second-guess the troops since I've never been in combat myself, but I have to wonder if maybe "bring it on" is better said by someone who is actually on the ground doing the fighting?  It seems to me that they have been bringing it on and, yes, they usually get pounded hard as a result, but only after US forces are hurt or killed.  Be careful out there. There's a war on.

      I'm going to use the word SPIKE at least once in every conversation I have today.  Spike Lee is suing Viacom (owners of the New  urlLink TNN ) over their choice of name for their revamped guy-oriented channel: Spike TV. A name like that could only lead people to assume that Spike Lee is involved (in someone's mind) and so Mr. Lee is having a  urlLink litigious  cow.  Honestly, when I heard about Spike TV for the first time, I thought of the late Spike Jones. Spike Jones Jr. has  urlLink weighed  in on the side of Viacom. Jones was named Spike at birth and would rather not have someone named Shelton Jackson Lee lay claim to exclusive use of Spike.

      Space exploration has long been an interest of mine -- in particular, manned space exploration. When I was a child I longed to become an astronaut and to strap myself to stalk of burning oxygen and hydrogen to reach orbit and the moon. As I grew older, I came to realize that being an astronaut required math skills... and then it was all over. My career choices seemed to be limited to that of Cowboy, Software Engineer or Pornographer. Hay fever and fear of prosecution forced me into the computer business.  I've been reading the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) report (yes, 248 pages) for the last two nights and I'm about 3/4 of the way through. The physical cause of the accident would seem to be incontrovertible: a piece of insulating foam on the external fuel tank near one of the support struts came loose and struck the left orbiter wing, causing a breach in the leading edge heat shielding.  But the report places part of the blame for the accident at the feet of NASA's "can do" culture and that sometimes "can do" was confused with "should do." Schedule, political and financial pressures all led to an environment in which past successes (sometimes just luck) were taken as proof that deviation from standards were "okay." For instance, the foam shedding issue had been observed on many occasions and, even though ZERO foam shedding was the standard, managers began to see it as acceptable.  In addition, the report features a chapter devoted to the history of NASA's manned space flight program and the process by which we ended up with the Shuttle as it is configured now. It is not a pretty story.  If you'd like to be a geek like me and read the entire report, you can find it  urlLink here .

      To great fanfare, Beaverton OR welcomed its first ever  urlLink Krispy Kreme  donut shop to town. Folks at my work went out to get in line for a heart attack. Ironically the arrival of Krispy Kreme to town comes just a few weeks after I was diagnosed with diabetes. Good thing it didn't happen the other way around -- although I guess I would have died smiling.

      Remember kids: don't threaten to "ki11 the pre$id3nt" unless you really mean it or unless your  urlLink teacher says it's okay  to do so. A Santa Rosa teacher gave an assignment in class that encouraged students to send the message to a member of Congress. The lesson was supposed be an "experiential exercise that would instill a sense of fear so they would have a better sense of why more people don't participate in the political process."  Expression is one thing, threating violence is another. Class dismissed?  I'm waiting up to see how long it takes for the FBI to arrive at my door.

      At issue is the presence of a 5,000+ pound engraving of the Ten Commandments that sits in Alabama's judicial building. Chief Justice Roy Moore of Alabama's Supreme Court placed it there (I'm assuming that he had some help) a couple of years ago and now he is being ordered by a Federal court to remove it.  From a CNBC.com article entitled  urlLink Commandments debate spans nation  :   In Alabama this week, the drama could hardly be any greater if Moseshimself came down the stairs of the court building to argue over display of the Ten Commandments. Presence of the tablets in the judicial building has been championed by the state's chief justice, and shot down by all his colleagues, with protest gathering on both sides. But this case is only one of many battles waged in courthouses from Pennsylvania to Washington state. And despite appearances in Alabama, the verdict on the issue remains out.  The complaint is that the 10 C's represent or might be seen to represent the State's endorsement of one religion over another -- a no-no according to the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution. Or is it? The text says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..."  Does the presence of this religious artifact in a "secular" court amount to Congress establishing an official religion? I don't personally think so. As long as the judge upholds the law, I don't see a problem with extra lawn ornaments on the grounds.

      In our zeal to apprehend and remove terrorists from our midst it is important to remember that ours is a nation of laws and that, even in difficult times, the Constitution must be upheld.  Over a year ago Jose Padilla was designated an "enemy combatant" because of his alleged involvement in a plot to detonate a "dirty" bomb. (Dirty bombs are conventional explosives mixed with low-grade radioactive material.) Mind you, this U.S. citizen has not been charged with the crime. Instead he is being held in a military brig without an opportunity to speak with an attorney.  Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the  urlLink Cato Institute  has  urlLink this  to say:   Obviously, to defend Padilla's constitutional rights is not to defend Padilla. If he is guilty as charged, he should never leave prison -- if he isn't executed.  Potential mass murderers deserve swift, sure and severe punishment. Genuine justice demands no less.  However, justice must be done, which means the truth must be determined through a procedure consistent with the Constitution.  If Padilla can be treated this way, any other citizen can be similarly detained. Let us hope that we can get our collective heads on straight and defend our founding document at home as well as abroad.

      I've always had to be a little bit different. If there is anything I fear it is that I might accidentally be thought of as "normal." Normal is so boring. It was for this reason (and others) that at the age of thirteen I taught myself to ride a unicycle.    Most of my friends were riding tricked out BMX bikes (I ran mine under a truck the year before) or racing around on super-light skateboards (mine came from the previous skateboard generation, was made of metal and had clay wheels -- no kidding!). So I figured that doing something that hardly anyone else could do would set me apart just far enough to remove any suspicion of normality.  My friend Kerry also rode one wheel and so we became almost inseparable throughout that seventh grade school year. We rode to school, we rode to the park, we rode to the store on the weekends. One Spring morning we showed up to school with handle bars and a bicycle wheel between us -- a  tricycle , get it?  So it was with great pleasure that, for the occasion of my 38th birthday, I grasped desperately for a retreating youth in the form of another unicycle. This one is much nicer than the one I had as a child -- 24" wheel, longer cranks and a trick handle at the front of the seat for acrobatics.  It has been said that you never forget how to ride a bicycle; it always comes back to you no matter how long it has been since your previous ride. The same can be said of unicycling. However another phrase came to mind today as I wobbled on one wheel for the first time in 25 years, "Youth is wasted on the young." OUCH! I used muscles in my legs that I had forgotten were there! Even as I type this I can feel my legs shaking.  My plan is to work up enough endurance to get all the way to work (1 mile) and back each day. I can never be 13 again, but I can at least approach some semblance of fitness in my "old" age.

      I've been listening to tunes on my 15MB Apple  urlLink iPod  for about three months now and thought I'd make a note, if not a review of the gear here. First of all, it's just amazing to be able to tote along not just some of my music but all of my music. After quite a few nights of playing disk jocky with my CD's, I digitized (ripped) almost all of my collection to my iMac. Subsequently I downloaded those tunes to the iPod via a FireWire connection. The iPod indicates 1754 "songs" inside and they go just about wherever I do.  The headphones that came with the unit are those little "earbud" things that, on me anyway, fall out at the slightest head movement. I purchased a pair of Philips behind-the-head headphones that work better for me when I'm moving around.  Battery life could be better. I find that they won't last an entire workday and so near quitting time I'm forced to listen to the clickity-clack of my keyboard. Charging is accomplished through a desktop cradle by way of the FireWire cable, drawing it's power from either the iMac or from a specially made AC wall bug. If I want to do charging away from home, I'll need to purchase another FireWire cable.  Audio quality is quite good, regardless of source: mp3 or AAC files. My musical tastes range from quiet vocal-dominant ballads to thrashing Industrial stompers and the iPod handles them all with equal grace.  The touch-sensitive controls can at times be a tad too touchy. It is very easy to inadvertently move to the next song or drive the volume up to 11. Fortunately there is a switch at the top which disables the front panel controls. The display has a contrast control, but I have yet to find a setting I'm completely happy with. The built-in backlight mitigates the issue somewhat but use of the light reduces battery life. Alas, there is no free lunch.  Oddly enough, this review came about because I wanted to talk about Karsh Kale's new album  urlLink Liberation . It rocks my world... and my iPod.

      Sounds scandalous, doesn't it? No, it's not what you might think. The other iJacking has been around for a a long while now. This is new. Excerpted from this  urlLink WIRED  article...   Feel Free to Jack Into My IPod.  Crandall was boldly approached by another iPod user, a 30ish woman bopping enthusiastically to some high-energy tune.  "She walked right up to me and got within my comfort field," Crandall stammered. "I was taken aback. She pulled out the earbuds on her iPod and indicated the jack with her eyes."  This is, of course, pretty silly. However the wireless sharing idea sounds cool. It wouldn't have to be limited to iPods. More excerpt:   Sharing an iPod through its headphone jack is also a crude, low-tech version of what some predict is the real killer application of future iPods: transforming them into short-distance broadcasting devices by adding Bluetooth or similar radio technology, coupled with Rendezvous, an Apple-developed networking technology that allows devices to discover each other automatically. ... "It would greatly annoy the RIAA, which would argue that it's a portable Napster," he wrote in 2002. "But ... this music-sharing appliance could have fairly dramatic social effects.... You could get promiscuous with strangers: You could pair and exchange a song on the same short bus ride. You could create short, ad hoc personal broadcasts, to anyone else with a Bluetooth iPod. You could have a 'What am I listening to?' menu option and share your choice with anyone within discoverable range."  Don't mind me... Soon I'll be bopping within my comfort field with promiscuous strangers.

      In an effort to stay somewhat in stride with the household laundry (as any good househusband would do) I scooped up all of the dirty laundry I could find this morning. Most of it was in the clothes hamper where any good househusband would place it, but other random articles of clothing were found on the floor, behind a table, and on the bed. Loading all of the colored items (remember, segregation is okay -- even encouraged -- where laundry is concerned) into our fabulously advanced Maytag washer, I set it to whir while I moved on to chores waiting for me in the garage.  Sometime later I returned to find the wash, rinse and spin cycles had completed. When I removed the first bit of clothing to place it in the equally stunning Maytag drier, I noticed a small bit of paper clinging like a barnacle to one of my socks. "Uh oh," I thought, "Looks as if I left something in a pocket." As it turns out I had left several somethings in my pocket -- an entire wallet full of somethings, as a matter of fact.  Remarkably the contents of my wallet were in pretty good shape as was the wallet itself. The few dollar bills were, of course, in perfect shape as U.S. currency is designed to survive such mishaps. The credit card, driver's license, and membership cards gleamed in laminated splendor. The business cards (both mine and those given to me by others) were soaked through but salvageable. Only one small slip of paper was rendered unrecognizable but I suspect that this item had originally been a long-ago note about picking up this or that at the grocery store.  I suppose something like this could have driven a reasonable person to homicidal rage but I decided to count it a blessing. Arrayed in front of me on the kitchen counter was the entire, expanded contents of my wallet. I had been presented with an opportunity to sort through all of the stuff (and things) that had accumulated in there over the preceding four years. Deciding what was worthy of preservation and what could be easily discarded gave me a great sense of accomplishment (if not god-like power -- sort of like deciding who lives and who dies.)  When my wallet eventually dries out, it will be lighter and better organized than it has been in years. One less thing for me to think about until I wash it again.

      I recently picked up a Griffin  urlLink iTrip  for my Apple  urlLink iPod  . This little device broadcasts the audio from my iPod to any nearby (optimally within three feet) FM radio. (You remember FM radio, right?)    The iTrip comes packaged with a collection of "songs" in the form of mp3 files. Each "song" is about five seconds long and contains a short burst of bleeps that tell the iTrip on which frequency to transmit. So, for instance, if you want the iTrip to broadcast on 94.1MHz, you simply play the iTrip 94.1 "song." It is really only necessary to play the first few seconds of the song to make it work... In fact, I discovered that if I played the entire song, it wouldn't work.  A small  red  LED (the manual says  blue ) provides some limited feed back on whether or not the iTrip received commands. You can use one of the songs to turn the LED off. I did this to conserve battery power. Despite what the Griffin marketing collateral says, the iTrip does have a serious impact to battery life. The good news is that it draws its power from the built-in iPod battery and can be charged while still attached.  So finally there's a station on a radio near me (very near me) that plays the songs I picked out and doesn't have a bunch of yapping "personalities" and commercials. It is bliss, I'm telling you! I really needed this. Couldn't live without it, in fact. More important than food and shelter.  Or not.

      A few months ago I purchased one of those nifty new HDTV sets that all the kids are raving about these days.  The picture looks great (when supplied with the proper signals), but it hasn't made TV shows any better. Was I ripped off? Shouldn't there be a "plot enrichment" mode? Can't it be made to filter out reality shows?  500 channels and still nothing is on. But I'll keep watching just in case!

      Is that fire retardant on your breath? It's not just for breakfast anymore.  According to this  urlLink WIRED  article, all of us are running around with loads of toxic chemicals in our bodies. Given the bad habits of my sordid past, I should probably be condemned and burned down lest I contaminate the water supply.   "Davis Baltz shops for organic food and otherwise tries to live as healthy as he can. So he was shocked to learn that the pollutants collecting inside his body sounded much like a Superfund cleanup site: pesticides, flame retardants and other nasty, man-made chemicals turned up in a recent test."  While the notion of having nasty stuff built up in our bodies is repugnant on the surface, no one is actually sure how much of the bad stuff is, well, "bad." Conspiracy theorists and professional environmentalists will likely have lots of fun with this one.  Meanwhile, I'm going to put all of that Homeland Security duct tape and plastic wrap to good use. The trick will be getting the new plastic and adhesive wardrobe to coordinate with my tin foil hats.

      Tania and I just finished watching  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind , the 2002 semi-autobiographical  urlLink film  adaption of the book of the same name written by Chuck Barris. Barris is probably best know in popular culture as the host of  The Gong Show .  I remember watching  The Gong Show  in the seventies (back when there were few channels and even fewer choices). At the time, watching the Barris' show was arguably better than, say, watching paint dry on a new wall. I can even vaguely remember the controversy surrounding specific things presented on the show and more generally the broad strokes with which critics painted the program. It was thought at the time that such programming lowered standards of broadcasts (a relative notion if there ever was one) and caused our national IQ to drop.  Fast forward to about 1998 and remember that similar criticism has been leveled at the likes of  Beavis and Butt-head  and, more recently, at the popular spate of reality shows. Just how dumb can TV get? I don't think we've reached the bottom nor do I think it honestly matters.  If TV is dumb,  Confessions  is a smartly (and darkly) produced film (directed by George Clooney) about the master of all that dumbness. To hear Berris tell it, he's more than just  Gong Show . He created the  Newlywed Game ! This, at least is verifiably true. However there are other aspects of Barris' life that were previously unknown -- and possibly downright untrue. False, perhaps. For instance, did you know that Happy Chuck worked for the CIA (indirectly) and participated in the assassination of as many as thirty-three people? No? I didn't know that and I don't think I know it now.  The trick to enjoying  Confessions  is in watching a life unfold in flashback and in allowing the author to have his way with the truth; watching through the lens of his point of view and imagination. You know that what you're watching is at least partially fictional, but it is intriguing all the same.  Sam Rockwell stars as Barris, Drew Barrymore plays his girlfriend, Penny.   Tania and I give it six popcorn kernels out of ten. Maybe extra (low-fat) butter for clever cinematography.

      And to think that all of this time people have been telling me that oranges are "good for you."  Now the Department of Fatherland er, uh, Homeland Security is telling us that we're under an Orange Alert. An attack could come from from the air (any number of terrorist branches could be harboring "ready to drop" oranges) or by sea (in the case of navel oranges).   All I can think to say right now is, "I told you so." The next revelation of doom will likely come from those pesky vegetables everyone tells me I should be eating. Don't say I didn't warn you.  Be careful out there.

      I think I have finally figured out what is behind the lottery business.  "Revenue?" you ask? Well, yes, a little of that and also some taxable income. According to this Associated Press  urlLink article , a city in Ohio was dismayed to find out that they could not tax the winnings of a local lottery-winning resident.   The news came at a bad time for South Euclid, which laid off six workers and made other cuts to help bring its $16.5 million budget down to $13 million, Welo said. The city had planned to use the windfall to rehire some workers and improve parks and recreation programs.  I think I finally understand how it works. It goes like this:   A city collects as much tax as it can possibly collect, creates bloated, ineffective public schools (specifically lacking the math education related to statistics and probability) which in turn brings thousands of new potential lottery players into the economy as they come of age. The hope for each city is that their respective constituents will be stupid enough to play and to do so often enough that one or more of them will win, entitling the city to a portion of the winnings in order to over-fund more crappy public schools.  Just because a theory is absurd doesn't make it wrong. ;-)

      Did you know who this Steve Irwin guy was before he was accused of endangering his one-month-old son? I didn't.  At least I didn't know him by name. Irwin is the Crocodile Hunter of Animal Planet fame (Animal Planet is one of those cable channels that we pay for but don't watch.) His modus operandi is to annoy wild reptilian creatures until they snap at him in apparent disgust -- all of it caught on camera as he provides a play-by-play narration.   Recently Irwin has been at the receiving end of some serious criticism because he was seen on tape feeding food to a crocodile with one hand while holding his newborn child in the other. Some have compared his behavior to that of Michael Jackson who, in 2002, dangled his kid out of a hotel window. I'm not sure which is more potentially harmful: a known carnivore or a suspected pedophile. Seems like Irwin knows what he's doing where crocks are concerned though.  This Associated Press  urlLink story  says, "Some fans sent messages of support while others vowed never to watch his shows again." I think I'll go with the latter group but, in my case, I'll vow never to watch his shows for the first time either.

      Just a friendly reminder to pay close attention to what your mobile phone company is "offering" you.  I've been a SprintPCS customer for three years now. When my previous contract came to an end, I received a nice, friendly note from the company offering an additional hour of "evening" minutes each day. This offer was being extended ostensibly because I had been a "loyal" customer. What I didn't read (my bad) was that the new plan took away an important feature: free PCS-to-PCS minutes.   About two weeks into the new plan I became aware that each time my wife called me from her Sprint phone we were "dinged" once for every minute she used and again for every minute that I used. In other words, we were essentially billed twice because we were both using our phones. Upon review of my new plan I saw that indeed this is what I had agreed to. (Again, MY BAD.)  After many MANY minutes (free of charge) on the phone with SprintPCS customer service, I was able to broker a deal to return my plan to more-or-less the same agreement I had made originally. I explained that, if they didn't make it "right" again, I would solider on through the end of my agreement and then switch providers no matter what they offered me subsequently. With number portability now the law of the land, I would be taking my number with me as well. In addition, I promised to spend the remaining year of my contract dogging Sprint publicly on my web site, in my blog and in person every chance I got.  They made it "right." Can I recommend Sprint? Not enthusiastically, but I will say that even a few minutes of any potential customer's time is well spent pouring over the fine print. They didn't have to make it "right," but they did -- so they win points for customer service. Next time, I'll read more closely and assume less. "Fool me once, shame on me..."  Dialer beware.  Want to talk about Cable TV companies? I don't. ;-)

      President Bush has recently called for a  urlLink constitutional amendment  to define marriage as being between a man and a woman. Finally! What a relief it is to have our Executive looking out for us. Who knows what horrible things could take place if, say, John and Don wanted to spend their lives together as a married couple. Oh, but wait! John and Don have already been living together for years. Surely by now the awful things that are supposed to happen when men marry men have already happened.  Perhaps it is because of John and Don that heterosexual marriages (the "right" kind, remember)  urlLink fail  40% of the time. Traditional marriage is a sacred institution and that is why for centuries it has been God's plan that Elvis can hitch up John and Sally forever or "until we sober up." Seems to me that marriage isn't particularly sacred in this country until someone comes along to ask if maybe we could change it.  Me? I'm a married straight guy; been married to the same gal for over eighteen years. We were married in a church and, as far as we're concerned, that's where the deed was done. I say this because, just after the ceremony, my wife and I had to sign a piece of paper issued by the state of Oregon that it was okay for us to be married. Well, good on them! But, basically, my life partner and I would be together anyway, regardless of what the state says.  Of course there are some legal ramifications to our marriage: namely that we have a right of survivorship should one of us die and that, at tax time, we can file our return as a couple. Additionally, my wife could make some decisions about my health care should I become incapacitated because, well, she's my wife. (Unless I'm in a vegetative state and my parents object to me being  urlLink unplugged .) Why is it impossible for same-sex partners to have this same assurance? Why is it such a scourge on our nation to admit that it might be a good thing?  How about we separate marriage from civil union; the church, chapel, temple, synagog, or mosque, would have responsibility for the first and the state (not the Federal government) would oversee the second. Some folks might want to get married and also enter into a legally-binding agreement. Others might want to have a ceremony at Starbucks or Vick's World of Tractors and then run down to city hall for the paperwork. What's the harm? Why can't same-sex couples document the same kind of commitment to unity as do their straight neighbors?  Are we getting hung on up the word "marriage?" Throw it out of state verbiage completely! That's right, you only get married as part of a religious ceremony. The state records your union and/or disunion. Simple.  Oh, and Mr. Bush? You've already made a mockery of our constitution, why go on to mess it up some more?

      A funny thing happened while signing up for an on-line class.  As some of you may be aware, I've been playing the role of semi-professional student lately. This is why, among other reasons, thompsonian*NET hasn't been updated regularly (or at all) lately. Anyway, let's not laugh at me, let's laugh at the on-line support I get from school (I will not name the school).  The on-line instruction page says:   The actual class will start Saturday February 14th. When you log in on Saturday, you will see your list of available classes. If you do not see your class or you are having login problems, please call the office M-F, 8am-5pm for help, 1 800 XXX-XXXX.  Does anyone else see a potential malfunction here? What happens if, for instance, I log in on Saturday for my first class and I cannot get in? Apparently I should wait until Monday to ask about it. Fun. My school offers courses in Information Technology Management. I won't be taking any of them but, then again, I don't think the ITS staff has either.

      I'm not sure whether this is outrageous or merely strange. I think it might be strange.  Music Television ( urlLink MTV ) which, until about ten years ago played music videos, occasionally finds time to play them between reality shows such as  urlLink The Real World ,  urlLink Cribs , and  urlLink The Osbournes . The new pop sensation that all the kids are raving about this week is  urlLink Fountains of Wayne  and MTV will be airing their new video periodically (between commercials for sneakers and "news" breaks). Problem is, they won't be airing the video the way Fountains of Wayne made it; they have removed some objectionable material.   This isn't entirely surprising since the network regularly alters videos to fuzz out corporate logos, obscene gestures and (one would presume) Janet Jackson's right breast should her wardrobe malfunction again. What happened this time is that, according to this associated press  urlLink report :   Fountains of Wayne made a video for the song "Mexican Wine" that originally showed twin ten-year-old girls jumping up and down saying they were going to perform "'Mexican Wine' by Fountains of Wayne!"  The girls are no longer seen uttering the words "Mexican Wine" presumably because ten-year-olds are much too young to be talking about wine. I thought that maybe they could just get around this by saying that the song is actually entitled "Mexican Whine" thereby removing the drug reference.   Whine not? "Wardrobe Malfunction" worked pretty well the last time.

      ...to get off of my property. This was the message I had for the sales dweeb wannabe who knocked on our front door at 9 P.M. While I suppose I should give him props for not calling on us during dinner, I thought that the hour was sufficiently late to cause alarm (we live in the 'burbs, after all.)  The kid was representing a local car repair shop and wanted to sell me on a coupon book containing eight oil change vouchers. For this, I would write a check made out to the shop. The reason for his visit was to, "let the people in the neighborhood get to know us."  I suggested that he leave the business' address with me so that I could go over there myself and get to know them. He wanted to sell me the coupons. I suggested that, if the shop could afford to offer oil changes for so cheap that perhaps they should just lower the price for a limited time; surely that would induce many of the neighbors to get to know them. He still wanted to sell me the coupon book. I asked if I could go to the shop in person, have an oil change and then, if I liked the service, purchase the coupon book directly from the shop. He really wanted to sell me the coupon book right then and there.  Finally I told him that I absolutely wasn't interested. And, then when he began to tell me what a great opportunity I was walking away from I told him, "The only person who will be 'walking away from' anything will be you walking away from my house." I gave him some specified time to reach the other end of my driveway before I would go into a blind rage.  Sigh. You always think of the perfect things to say later on. A few of them were:  * We don't have a car anymore. We donated it to the auto repair shop trade school so that boys and girls could learn an important skill. * We don't need a car. You see that big cul-de-sac? That's where the helicopter lands each morning to take me to work. * Look! A naked woman!   * I'm so glad you dropped by. Would you like to come in for a bite?    Ah, entrepreneurship ... or is it ontra-manure-shi*? Release the hounds!

      Tania and I just watched all THREE HOURS of the 1999 PT Anderson film  urlLink Magnolia  staring just about everyone.  The less I say about the plot here the better. Internet Movie Database  urlLink reviews  are fraught with spoilers and run hot and cold; very few are luke warm. We thought it was hot, but we're still asking ourselves if we really did see what we thought we saw. It rains cats, dogs and other things.  Especially  other things.  This film is not your ordinary Hollywood production and may not, in fact, be your cup of tea. You'll either love it or hate it. If you're not afraid of being completely confused for a while (or for, say, the rest of a day), check it out. ...or don't. You have been warned.

      You may have heard something about the Democratic National Convention going on in Boston, MA this week. It's a large affair and, depending upon your political leanings, either significantly important or more of the same.  Either way, you might want to check out all the  urlLink blogging  that is going on from the convention floor. So far it looks as if the traditional journalists are busy interviewing the unconventional journalists, keeping these blog-stars from getting much of anything done. We'll see if they have another excuse as the week goes on.   I'm not a huge fan of either major political party so please don't take this as an endorsement for the Dems. For the most part, I'm interested to see if there is any noteworthy difference between what comes out of traditional news outlets and what appears on the blogs. I'm hoping that the GOP will allow similar reporting at their convention later on this year.  (Allen lives somewhere between wonksville and geekland.)

      Those of you living under a rock may not know that Apple has released a new generation of  urlLink iPod  mp3/AAC players. According to Apple, they feature longer battery life and the ability to vary the playback speed of audio books.  The new units are slightly less expensive ($$ per Megabyte) than the second generation players. This is a good thing considering that the iTunes Music Store has made the 9/11 hearings available for free  urlLink download  in 36 files. All freedom-loving Americans everywhere will want to review every syllable of these exciting investigatory hearings. Armed with one of these new iPods, you'll have the necessary storage to collect all of the hearings and you will be able to play them back at high speed to impress your friends!

      Tania and I just (finally) watched  The Matrix: Revolutions . If only we could live that two hours over again, I'm sure we would put it to good use. But, hey, I'm being negative again and I previously said I wouldn't be so down on everything. Stuff blows up; lots of people die. Thousands of Agent Smiths cause trauma for Neo. If "more" is better, this film is great. Work it out for yourself.  On a more positive note... remember, I'm endeavoring to be more positive... Tania and I also went to see  Spider-Man 2  recently. If you're a fan of the comic (we are not comic fans) you might find it lacking, but if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one even better. It's campy, fun, and full of ambiguous characters (neither good or bad, rather a mix of both) just like real life.  And while I'm on the subject of films, I would also recommend  Twelve Angry Men  (1957) starring Henry Fonda. I watched it as part of a discussion topic for a social psychology class. The movie depicts an example of minority opinion having sway over a majority.

This most recent dedication is differentiated from previous declarations by nothing at all so far as I can tell. Upon review, it would seem that I only take the time to blog if I'm really upset about something and this leaves any reasonable reader with the impression that I'm continually pissed off.   Generally speaking, I am an optimistic guy. Now, if only everything didn't suck... ;-)

      Allegedly, everyone's favorite vocalist, Linda Ronstadt, was escorted from the Aladdin Casino because she made some remarks favorable to Michael Moore's film  Fahrenheit 9/11 . (She was escorted from the building; the alleged part is that she is "everyone's" favorite vocalist.)  According to  urlLink this  open letter from Michael Moore to the owner of the Aladdin, Ronstadt dedicated the Eagles song Desperado to Moore and, presumably, to the essence of his latest documentary film. Again, allegedly, Ronstadt was escorted out of the building and "wouldn't even let her go back up to her room at your hotel!"  While I think it's certainly okay for someone to think that this was a wrong-headed thing to do and that, by acting in such a strong-armed way, the Aladdin is risking some bad publicity, nowhere do I see any violation of Ronstadt's first amendment rights as Moore claims. Let's examine that amendment, shall we?   "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  I don't recall -- and perhaps Moore can help us here -- the number of the House and Senate bills that were passed to prevent Ms. Ronstadt from speaking her mind. What I do see here is the owner of a company making a decision about what sorts of material may be presented on his property. Now, he exercises this right at the risk of public outrage and a possible boycott, but he has violated no laws. More importantly, Ronstadt's first amendment rights were not violated because the first amendment has nothing at all to say about private employers. The limit is placed on government's power with regard to speech.  I am sympathetic to Moore's point here, but he is way off base to call this a first amendment issue. He has been way off base before and I'm sure it will happen again.

      As you probably know I have a registered domain name. (It's printed on this page several times -- you figure it out.) Anyway, occasionally I get an email from parties interested in linking to my site and, after blacklisting their address, I go on with my life as if nothing happened. Usually this mail comes from those link-building services that aim to increase visitors to a site by linking yours to others. I don't give a flying poo about how many people visit my site; the whole operation seems a waste of time.   Most recently (about an hour ago, actually) I received just such an email. The author thought that I might want to provide a link to and perhaps a review of a "related" wood-working web site. You know, because I do a lot of wood-working and I post about all of my latest creations with the lathe and the plainer and the orthogonal reciprocating crosscut in-line band saw and stuff. The truth of the matter is that I haven't once mentioned "wood-working" or "wood" and I seldom like to talk about "working" at all.   This guy's site claims that his messages aren't SPAM because there's no commercial gain involved. But I have to wonder what is the point of increasing clicks and face time for a site if it isn't commercial? Ponderous. ...blacklisted! (Whew, that took a little longer than usual.)

      Many years ago (when dinosaurs roamed the earth and I was in my early twenties) I remember telling people that there were three things I would never do:   I would never own a cell phone. Cell phones in the eighties were expensive and, frankly, status symbols. If you could afford one of those things and didn't mind carrying the battery pack around your waist, you could show the rest of the world just how bloody rich you were. I despised these people.  I would never live on a cul-de-sac. For many of the same reasons above, I saw life in the 'burbs and more evidence of conspicuous consumption and wanted no part of it at all.  I would never own or drive a BMW. The Ultimate Driving Machine was, in my mind, the Ultimate Yuppie Machine. My motto was "Die yuppie scum!"  So you might wonder how I'm doing so far on my list of things I'm "never going to do." I own a cell phone. In fact, I cancelled my old-fashioned residential phone line and rely on the mobile phone exclusively. No regrets there. I live an a fabulous home in the 'burbs on a cul-de-sac. So much for that ambition. Finally, while I don't actually own one, the neighbors have a beautiful BMW coupe that stirs a certain amount of awe in me every time I see it. Someday if I give up my motorcycle fetish, I might have to own one of those too. I've grown up (a little) and have found that I have certain materialistic needs. Also, I'm nowhere near as "smart" as I was when I was younger -- in fact, I'm now as dumb as I thought my parents where back then.  What does all of this have to do with anything? Well, almost nothing actually... but you have stayed with me this far so I might as well get to the point. I ran across this  urlLink column  in Newsweek (care of MSNBC) written by Robert J. Samuelson who refuses to own or use a cell phone for more fundamental reasons. He thinks that mobile phones are annoying and unreliable. Someday soon, I may be the last man in America without a cell phone. To those who see cell phones as progress, I say: they aggravate noise pollution and threaten our solitude. The central idea of cell phones is that you should be connected to almost everyone and everything at all times. The trouble is that cell phones assault your peace of mind no matter what you do. If you turn them off, why have one? You just irritate anyone who might call. If they're on and no one calls, you're irrelevant, unloved or both. If everyone calls, you're a basket case. While I think he makes valid points, he's ignoring a few others. For instance, just because you have a cell phone doesn't mean that you have to answer it when it rings or that you even have to let it ring. If I don't wish to be disturbed, I will turn the ringer off and turn the vibrating page feature on (or as I like to called it "pleasure mode.") If the caller-id suggests that the person on the other end is worthy, I'll take the call. If not, they can go to voice jail and I'll call their voice jail at a time of my choosing.   Samuelson complains that people talk on their phones in restaurants and other public places. I don't see these behaviors as evidence of evil cellular technology as much as I see them as just poor social skills. If you won't pick your nose in a crowded elevator, then you shouldn't gab about your painful gall bladder surgery between courses three and four at the Fine Diner. Choose your conversation times and topics carefully and you won't often offend where decorum is required or expected. There's really no need to bury your electronic head in the sand.  So, please keep in touch. My voicemail will call your voicemail and they'll do lunch sometime.

      This is  urlLink fun . (NY Times free registration required.)   Are you going to the Big Apple to protest the upcoming RNC convention? (Hey, who isn't?) While you're there, don't forget to pick up your "peaceful political activists" button. I think you can get your parking validated and reduced admission price to the Museum of Sex. I'm not making this up. "It's no fun to protest on an empty stomach," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday, when he announced the program at NYC & Company, the city's tourism office, which will distribute the buttons to all comers to its Midtown office. I suppose the only good time to protest on an empty stomach is while on, for instance, a hunger strike. Perhaps I'm just pointing out the obvious.  Trade in your " Lick Bush. Beat Dick. " bumper sticker for one of these protest buttons and be on the side of the good guys. Its the right thing to do and, besides, it could save you serious money at Applebee's. Try the Freedom Fries. Whatever you do, don't go to Central Park with your friends and, um, say anything political.

      Thanks mostly to a tip from one of my peeps (shoutz out 2 Gordon out on da West side), it has come to my attention that Taiwan will finally receive its first  urlLink Mr. Donut  franchise. I can't count the number of times I've been in Taiwan and haven't been able to find a decent donut (I can't count it because zero doesn't require counting although the number is roughly donut-shaped.)   Word on the street (or cul-de-sac) is that if Mr. Donut does well, the owner will follow up with the much needed Mr. Saltine and Mr. Pencil Sharpener.

      No way! You mean there exist several  urlLink agendas , hidden or otherwise, in the appointment of scientists in governmental positions? Say it isn't so! Incorporating scientific advice into policymaking involves an implied contract of trust between government officials and scientists. Scientists trust that their advice will be weighed honestly, without attempts to distort, deny or refute it. Government officials trust that scientists will not inject personal opinions or a political agenda into their advice. I'm not sure where this "implied contract" comes from. One would certainly hope that any administration would be open to any and all points of view -- something that I think our current administration cannot seem to get right -- but the notion that government-funded science itself isn't or shouldn't be political is ridiculous. Scientific research is expensive; it requires money. The sources of funding will almost always have one political or philosophical bent of one kind or another and so, to one degree or another, scientific research will necessarily bend to the will of the funding bodies. All the more reason to leave government out of such endeavors. ...but that's just me. Want another example? How about government funding for the arts? Now  there's  a topic on which we can all agree.  Not.

      The sly folks down at the Department of Homeland Security are going to launch a new program to teach kids how to rat out... er, “educate” their parents. According to this USA Today  urlLink article :  Starting next month, children in grades 4 though 8 and employers nationwide will be asked to help get families and companies better prepared to respond to a crisis. Let the fun begin. Soon Johnny will be informing on Mommy and Daddy when they don't follow the National Plan. Just as children learned to bug their parents to quit smoking and wear seat belts, Homeland Security officials hope grade-school kids will prompt moms and dads to put together emergency plans. And to hold still while the nice officer scans your implanted ID chip. All the more reason to home school your kids, in my opinion. Oops... here come the helicopters again. Where’s my tinfoil hat?  Goose steppin’ to the oldies!

      Adding to our previous installment on our youngest dog's obsession with whatever it was that had crawled under the deck... It would seem that the culprit was a squirrel. I saw it, they saw it and chased it to the tool shed in our back yard. The squirrel made its way safely up the fence and over the top, but that didn't restrain the dogs from running back and forth along the fence like the morons that they are.   I became distracted with something and then looked up just in time to see Hunter's back end disappear beneath the shed. He had used those wonderfully evolved/created/bred paws to dig himself a trench just deep enough to scurry through. Of course he's too stupid to know how to get himself out again. While he was under the shed, the older dog, Reiner, heard noises and thought that he had better investigate – barking like a … well, like a dog. The noises he was hearing were coming from the aforementioned Hunter who was now trying to figure out how to get back out.  The short end to a long story is that I had to shovel a trench deep enough so that I could reach in, grab hold of Hunter and pull him part way through the channel until he could figure out that his freedom was just a belly crawl away.   Back in the house now, the dogs are "grounded." I've taken away their allowance and they can't watch television with their friends after school. I've also erected a make-shift barrier along the bottom of the shed to try to head off a repeat performance of today's excitement. Kids these days!

      (or Rhesus Pieces)  Yet another WIRED.com  urlLink article  to share. (Notice how I seem to get all of my news from WIRED? I subscribe to the print version, look at the pretty pictures and then read the thing online.) It seems that scientists have discovered that if they block dopamine receptors in the brains of rhesus monkeys the monkeys turn into mad office workers. No kidding. For their study, Richmond and colleagues used seven rhesus monkeys. They had to push a lever in response to visual cues on a projection screen, and got a drop of water as a reward.  "They work more efficiently -- make fewer errors -- as they get closer to being rewarded. But without the dopamine receptor, they consistently stayed on-task and made few errors, because they could no longer learn to use visual cues to predict how their work was going to get them a reward." The only drawback was that, with all of the water the monkeys were sucking up, bathroom breaks took away whatever efficiency they had enjoyed. The next revolutionary work-inducing invention will be the in-cube toilet, no doubt. "The gene knockdown triggered a remarkable transformation in the simian work ethic. Like many of us, monkeys normally slack off initially in working toward a distant goal," he added. The original study was supposed to be finished months ago but the scientists involved knew they had lots of time to complete it and sort of, you know, slacked off until the last minute. This is common; I have a report for social psychology due on Friday and that's why I'm blogging right now.

      Don't you just dislike those web sites that require you to "register" in order to read their new items? (I was going to say "hate" instead of "dislike," but the feeling I have just isn't that strong.) I mean, I understand why companies want to at least have a good guess at how many individual readers drop by (and view their ads) -- this is one of the ways in which they make money. Seems "reasonable." However, I have a very poor memory for which sites I've registered a log-in name; which address I used, which password I thought of and so I created a single alter-ego (complete with its own valid email address) to use for all of my registrations.   As far as they know, I'm a middle-aged housewife earning $45,000 annually (by selling orange peel lampshades on eBay) and my interests are skateboarding, knitting and Pong. Presumably this information is used to support advertising revenues and to select what kinds of ads I am likely to see when I visit any given web site with which I am registered. It's a good gig -- at least it is for me.   WIRED.com (no registration required, by the way) tells me that I am not  urlLink alone . Lots of people do this -- certainly not the majority, but likely enough to throw off the official count when ad rates and demographic stats are concerned. My comrades and me are likely going to cause the next economic depression... sorry about that.   Signed, Amanda Hugandkiss, Hoople, AK.

      "Whine! whine! whine," went the doggie.  So, I let the mini-doxie outside for the umpteenth time in a two-hour span.  Does he need doggie-Detrol? No, he doesn't pee, poop or anything. Instead, he obsessively sniffs his way to the northwest corner of the deck and "plop!" he's off the deck, nose augured into the ground. He's on the scent.  Is it a rabbit?  Tasmanian devil? Who knows. But, I'm convinced that something wicked went under the deck, perished, and now the aroma of decay is tantilizing the puppy senses. It calls to him. He must go.  "Whine! whine! whine," went the doggie.  I look over the side of the deck and can follow his puppy trail along the perimeter: signs of digging, a double-paw-width, as he's tried to excavate a path to claim the tempting prize.  How incredibly gross. He's drooling as he looks up at me.  Tail wagging.  I look over at the tweeny-doxie who sits in a prized spot of sunshine on the deck, soaking up the rays. Completely oblivious. Or old.  "Whine."  Oops. That was me.  I think I need to go inside now.

      Many news outlets are running with a  urlLink story  about four people killing six other people over the theft of an Xbox and some clothes.  The four killers, armed with aluminum baseball bats, forced their way into the home where the victims were in beds early Friday morning, and beat them to death -- just as Victorino planned, Johnson said. I suppose headlines such as "Xbox killers" and "Sheriff: 4 charged in Florida killings over Xbox" make for sexy copy but what really happened is that, allegedly, a bunch of thugs killed people who were asleep in bed. The fact that an Xbox was misappropriated is tangential to the larger story.   While I'm sure I would see red if someone stole my game console, I don't think I would feel justified in beating the perpetrator to death with a baseball bat. You have to understand that I own a PS2 and play Grand Theft Auto quite a lot. If I want to beat someone to death with a bat, I'll do it in the game. (Cue: New call for more strict regulation of violent video games... wait for it...)  What about a comprehensive "assault bat" ban? I mean, you can't tell me that those aluminum bats are useful for hunting... er... bunting. Bats don't kill people, stolen video games kill people. Personal responsibility, anyone? Anyone? Bueller?

      According to this  urlLink story  in the Scotsman News, Prozac and other pharmaceuticals have been found as trace elements in drinking water. Apparently these chemicals are not entirely broken down when digested and end up in the waste water; some of the material survives treatment and ends up in ground water. A spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which includes the DWI, said: “It is extremely unlikely that there is a risk, as such drugs are excreted in very low concentrations and biodegraded during sewage treatment and in watercourses. I would have thought that DWI stood for Drinking Water Inoculated had I not read that it stood for Drinking Water Inspectorate. Expectorate? Perhaps I was within spitting distance of the truth.

      After years of running with hand-me-down computers my parents' latest boat anchor finally bit the dust. You can only replace bits a pieces of an old machine so many times. So, anyway, they asked me to take them computer shopping. I just love spending other people's money! I set them up with a fancy new HP. This thing has more bells and whistles than I've seen recently and it has been a while since I've even touched a PC so it was an adventure. Windows XP has moved all the controls to places I couldn't find but we eventually got everything going. About 25 critical updates later we had a working machine... I think.   It passed the ultimate test: viewing of  The Matrix  lobby scene. Superb.

      There's a big stink being raised by some critics about the alleged selling of "advertorial" material on Fark.com and possibly other blog sites. Product placement seems to have migrated from the visual media to electronic print outlets. From a WIRED  urlLink article :  Paid placement is a long-running issue with search engines. Google does not accept payment for ordering search results, while Yahoo does. But while newspapers and magazines have traditionally been loath to blend advertising and editorial, product placement is common on television and in movies. Yeah, right. Our local newspaper has runs a huge real estate section each Sunday that is quietly labled as a product "of our Advertisement Department" or some such.   I just want to make it clear, you know, for those who really care, that we at thompsonian*NET receive no incentives or cash from any company or organization in exchange for mention in our blog. That's why, for instance, I won't mention the fine products available from Winkley's Pharmaceuticals, makers of NutraMints -- "the mutli-vitamin that leaves your breath fresh as a summer breeze." Mmmm... good supplement.

      There's an  urlLink article  on WIRED.com about a guy who built an antenna on the end of a rifle stock. He can snoop your fancy-pants bluetooth phone from a distance.   Security professionals Adam Laurie and Martin Herfurt demonstrated the attacks last week at the Black Hat and DefCon security and hacker conferences in Las Vegas. Phone companies say the risk of this kind of attack is small, since the amount of time a victim would be vulnerable is minimal, and the attacker would have to be in proximity to the victim. But experiments, one using a common laptop and another using a prototype Bluetooth "rifle" that captured data from a mobile phone a mile away, have demonstrated that such attacks aren't so far-fetched. Check out the pictures... I guess there's no need to lead the target. Long-distance calling takes on a whole new meaning.

Taken directly from the  urlLink transcript  of today's statement by GWB as he signed the latest defense appropriation bill into law: "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." I think I understand what he was trying to say but... uh. Does he write his own material?

      I just want to take a moment to welcome two new contributors to the thompsonian*NET blog.   Tania, in addition to being my lovely wife of almost 19 years (gasp), is a talented writer and thinker. (Well, she can be forgiven for not thinking clearly when she chose a husband.)  Aaron had absolutely no choice in the matter of being related to me -- he was born that way. My youngest brother possesses a fantastic sense of humor and his own unique style. (Because you see, if it wasn’t  unique , then it wouldn’t be his  own , now would it?)  Please welcome them both. I look forward to their contributions to the experiment.

Bob Ivey is unforgettable as the latex-wrapped, fireproofed mummy. His cowboy boots are a great touch, pard'ner. Who woulda thought the story of two old guys in a nursing home battling evil could be so engaging?  Filmed in 30 days on a very low budget, it's destined to become a cult classic.

      Tania and I went for a ride out to Forest Grove for lunch today. The weather here has finally turned to a more characteristic overcast and 70 degrees. The webs between our fingers and toes have almost grown back as a result. A scan of the skyline to the west made me think that it might actually be raining a bit out toward the coast. All of this is a welcome change given the heightened awareness of fire hazard in the area. Most of the fields have been cut and bailed but it would be a shame if the hay got wet – yeah, I know, they use machines to move those bails around these days but, still…   For the locals: the intersection of highways 6 and 47 at Banks is all torn up. Expect about ¼ of a mile of loose gravel. We weren’t expecting it.

      What are dachshunds good for? I've conducted a controlled study of dachshund usefulness over the past four weeks. Using a "tweeny" and a miniature dachsund as test subjects, I've observed the following:      They sleep.     They eat.     They pee and poop.    They repeat as as often as necessary.    But what good are they? I also explored this question. And here's what I discovered:      They are adorable.     They are entertaining.     They have the capacity to love unconditionally.     They're darn cute!    I think we'll keep 'em!

      According to a  urlLink story  on silicon.com:  The Finnish army is in a right old state if one official is to be believed. A bunch of young men are being excused from military service due to a debilitating modern illness - internet addiction. Apparently anything can be thought of as an addiction these days. Of course you might expect someone who uses the Internet as much as I do to be cynical -- obviously I'm in denial. I wonder if there's a support group for folks like myself who cannot seem to resist an RSS feed.  I'm a pretty busy guy... hopefully the Internet Addiction support group meets online.

Unfortunately, now that I look at my web site, I think it looks like garbage by comparison.   No time to worry about that just now though.

We'll rent it in October when it comes out on DVD.  ... or not. Time to get a bigger boat? (People say we're gettin' a little dinghy.)

      I think I can at last admit that I am becoming "old" in the sense that I no longer connect with or even recognize popular music. Some time ago (perhaps even as many as 15 years ago) MTV stopped playing music videos.  A friend of mind told me that they play music in the wee hours of the morning because the more expensive-to-produce talking shows don't find their audience at that time. I instructed my ReplayTV DVR to record a segment of MTV over night and, sure enough, the channel plays a good number of music videos over a period of three hours. Some of them are in such heavy rotation that you will see them twice in that time span. Anyway, that's when I realized that I had fallen completely out of touch with anything even remotely "youth-oriented." Long ago I passed out of the much vaunted 18-34 year old demographic and so too passed beyond the grasp of this channel with which I once connected so well. I did like most of what I saw however -- even though I had not a clue who the artists were.  Darned kids. ;-)  PS: Hey, I miss  urlLink Martha Quinn .
