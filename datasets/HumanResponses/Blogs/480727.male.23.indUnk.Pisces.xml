      the inner conscious tells me that i shouldn't open to others,..i mean expressing wats deep inside,..but wat the heck,..rather tell the truth than be guilty abt it,... lets use an example for such action... wanna tell a lie,..but a lying is something that does not happen,..(something thats not experienced,..) therefore one will tend to forget wat he/she lied abt, n will make the mistake of blurting something different,..therefore,...am not gonna lie,..=p erm,..then again,..thats why they have a lie detector,.. well, well,..such nonsense gonna be blurt our my dear, so bear wif it,.. but one thing for sure, i wanna hear about u,... erm,..."arafah"...thankz to u,....i get that title.. thankz to me its not my nick

      damn. that prose is so true. wish there were more pple in this world who realised that.  am feeling damn pissed off now cos this guy who has been clinging to me for the past dunno how many months has suddenly announced that he never intended to make something out of it. i tell you if he was in front of me right now he wouldnt have teeth left.  i mean, fine he wants to be frens i'm ok with that, so dun la tell me you love me you miss me and then now you say that I'm the one who's perasan and thinks he likes me. what the hell?? i tell you i am so sick and tired of PERASAN guys ok...why is it they always think i like them, or worse still, they think i think they like me?? ish. can you please dont call our meeting a 'date'? i dunno...i dun like the word.  how about just a meeting of two pple who havent met for a long time? better?  i dunno. "dating" sounds so stressful. sorry for being so grumpy today. i just had to let off steam...

      seems that the tradition that i ha in JC is being carried on,.. used to celebrate 14th FEbruary as friendship day,..remember old frens, say hi,....buy them some stuffs,..exchange,..go out fer lunch or dinner,.. well,..this year seems to be juz smsing,..nvm,..am going for a chalet tomorrow,...free food,..=) thinking back abt my past, seems that my life is painted by frenz,...well, they come n go,...but some remains,...received an e-mail from one of the jjcian,...would like to share it wif u,...   Being Twenty-Something  They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get hot and scared because you barely know where you are now.  You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or Insincere, but that they are as confused as you are.  You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren't so great after all.  You are Beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not. You are insecure and then Secure.  You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly change is the Enemy and you cry and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing To do but stay where you are or move forward. The stupid ones plateau, the smart ones rise.  You get your heartbroken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else.  You go through thesame emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem tomake a decision.  You wonder what in the hell is wrong with you. We are making a lot of mistakes, but helping one another learn from them. We will piss one another off, and laugh at the end of a conversation that Started with angry words.  We are in our best of times And our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out. We are friends, and in 10 years we will be friends who have figured out where we fit in in this world. So don't be anxious about tomorrow, Live one day at a time.

      since when do chinese girls like jocks? i thought they like anyone who's rich? :) the dinner ended at 12 actually..but we were hanging around taking pictures until 130 and by the time i got back it was 2am lah... i dunno...during the week i sleep very little, but when i come back during weekends i sleep like a log. like just now la balik rumah at 12noon...have been sleeping till now...it's 4pm... the lecturers are ok lah...not really handsome. some of the clinical doctors are la...but not the regular lecturers. i fell asleep in class yesterday and today..habis kena marah ngan my roommate for staying up late so how was the eco challenge?  saw a video on the riots in ambon and maluku yesterday nite..it was so upsetting...was reminded of it when you told me pasal sentosa and its parties..i mean our biggest problem normally would be what dress to wear to the next glam occasion but for these people it's matter of survival...it's so sad...such a big diff between countries that are not very far apart... sigh tie you up later then...:)

      eh...next time service la the bike properly nearly had a heart attack reading the line that you had an accident how's your fren? i suppose most brilliant people end up being mad cos they cant relate to the rest of the population and vice versa. the problem with the general public is that they are so narrow minded. i dont know which category i fall in tho.:) studying is fun..gee that sounds like the bookworm club slogan...i mean if you approach it properly...must make sure you leave room for other stuffs too la where you working now? as in, the part time job thingy i agree with you about the exes can be good frens kinda thing but it also depends on how you break up. i mean like with my ex(the most recent one) we were so close during the relationship...and i know him inside out...can anticipate what he's gonna do in what situation...but i dont think he even remembers what i like. i know he does..but cos he was two timing me..i find it hard to talk to him...i mean how can i ever trust him again, you know? but we are still very close la...it's just that it's a one sided thing...he talks i listen...and besides...i dont really like to talk to non-boyfriends about my personal problems...prefer to figure it out myself... his gf dumped him last night...he was so upset he sounded insane...i wonder if he was that upset about me leaving him...i dont think so since he already had a replacement in the sidelines i dunno why i'm still frens with him...he causes me so much hurt...but i suppose we go way back...so i guess i do care about him in some way

      itz ok for me to be a madman,...taking it as a compliment,..=) ever heard of plato's analogy of the cave,..the madman was a genious,..kind of like einstein n other weirdos,.. if you never hear abt it before,..i'll be glad to tell you his analogy,..well,..learn a bit of philosophy from my art project,..=) guess wat,..had an accident juz now,..=( well,..no major injuries juz bruises,.. was on a bike wif my colleague,..(nak gi kerja part time),..bike jammed in the middle of PIE,...swoosh,..white van missed us,..bang,..blue lorry hits us,...the back box was smash,..nearly hit on an incoming car,..selamat my reflex is quick,..alhamdulillah masih dapat chat dengan dia,..well,..bike dah stall,..damaged badly,..gotta thank the box though,..kind of cusion the impact,.=)  tell u wat,..honestly ,..you are my dream ger,..well,..since my childhood.. am using u as an inspiration,..(well even though am not in contect wif u,..gotta have role model, rite) erm,..calling u my dream will be to ridiculous of couse,..well,..lets make it a make belief,..of coz u dun have to be wat i think u are or anything,..its juz me feeling my void of emptiness,..its good to dream u know,.. erm,..haven't been studying for a year now,..kind of misses it,.  i find it funny how people sees a relationship.to me relationship, premaritally is about being the closest of fren of the opposite gender,..well of coz u can have a close guy fren without a relationship, but juz add love as in feeling to it,..even with the "love" diminshes, n relationship ceases,..dun think that frienship freezes,..he still knows you better than some other friend,..know wat you are like,..your likings n stuffs,..still could be best of buddies,..well,..am like that wif my ex,..erm,..only have one,..therefore the ideology seems to work for me,..dunno abt you,..seems to have lots of them,..-bad publicity,..  abt parents' midlife crisis,..seems that being at home to be a perantara does work here,..ben watching mum n dad playing crouching tiger, hiddn dragons for eons now(erm,.haven't watch the show)..least family is not that rocky yet. opps,..i'll be back,..

      oh god...i think i have just connected myself with a madman.. heh. so what you up to? what is it about me that you wanna know? and what is it that you wanna tell that your inner conscious is not letting you tell? hmm..that's the prob with talking with a poet always got isi tersirat :) erm..about me... sigh am still very much a studious person for a while i tried to change it and be hip and happening but i think i like myself better this way and besides i like what i study even though my friends say it's quite morbid cos i look at corpses every other day but i like it just hope i can pass the dratted exams it's REALLY difficult ish love life...nothing much i'm kinda over my last ex there's this sarawakian guy who is kinda hovering around but not really making any moves so i'm not gonna bother that much then there's you... then there's that silly guy who tells everyone i like him but tells me he likes me...duh... so i dunno i mean priority for me will always be studies and family and family these days aint so stable my parents are going through mid life crisis so i dunno think i should be home more often to jadi perantara that's the prob when you are the eldest the whole family's burden is on your shoulders whether you are a guy or a girl and somemore my brothers and i are quite far apart in terms of age but we are close la but you know...i cant really tell them that my parents are fighting kan...kesian la pulak...

      arghh,..for the firs time in my life,..i've been sabotage,...adding the spice to it,...by my own relatives,.. well,..its my cousin's one year old b'day,..theres a family gathering ,.well, a party,. went on, a happening one i might say for a 1 yr old,.felt that i better keep mump abt THE day,..dun intend to celebrate it,.bought for him two cute socks,..hehee,.. after the party, the cousins planned to go bowling, of coz gotta have some adult(kalau tidak siapa nak belanja),..had fun at the bowling alley. Then we went to Bt Gombak to eat,..erm,..they did gave some hint abt the sabotage,..like" erm,..so who's gonna be home the left overs(curry, sambals n dalca)"..din realise it though..when its parting time, my brother promt for the others to go to the car, to take some berkat from the b'day party. so,..all of followed,..in the middle of the bringe,(was engrossly talking to my cousin),..kapoom,..AN air raid of flour and eggs,..was caught by surprise. ..  Erm,..when i reached home, took a look at the mirror, realised something. My hair was white, ...then told myself, no wonder they uses flour for b'day,..kind of makes me looks older,..maybe thats wat it's suppose to symbolise, The coming of age. The egg, seems to be seen as the "birth",.. conclusion, age is the lost of youth,  Hey, you take care now,..had a good ay juz now,..n my room,..its pretty neat,.=) wished that you are here,.....@hugzzz@

      they say life is straight, u live to die.. i'll say, life is dead.  just gonna comment on something. seems that we men are funny. we tend to like pretty ladies. and most of our crushes are damsels. so wats the true defination of love at first sight.. erm,..am getting alot of it lately.. they say that beauty is found in the inner self. but seems that many have that that beauty. get to know many girls with great hearts. then again, confucious once said"every man are born a good seed". arghh...love is funny. but one thing for sure, getting to know someone is special. you dun say hi to everyone, u'll meet up somehow..well, to me this is the beauty of fate. I think that fate is the searcher of ideal couple. a cupid in the form of time. thats y most people are attached from within their social circles.  Dunno abt you, but from my own experience, one could adapt to changes. Wat can i say, life is a big stage. Acting well is the best way to be kept on-stage.

      hmm...piles is not caused by heatiness. what la you. ahem. it's caused by not going to the toilet often enough and then when you do, the pressure builds up and the veins in your anus enlarge and protrude out, and the possibility of it bleeding once it has protruded is more. there's only 3 major veins in the anus and they kinda go around it so...moral of the story...eat lotsa fibre, drink lotsa water, and go to the toilet regularly. make sure when you do your stool is soft. ok...? heh...this is the doctor speaking. :) NS..i dunno. i think it's ok la just that most people have trouble getting back to complete their studies after that. dah lama sgt tk study kot...its good for the girls la...cos once they reach uni the guys will be 2yrs older...more matured...:) take care

      hello. i dun think you come here anymore but just in case you do i thought i'd just leave a word or two.   how are you? i havent heard from you in a long time. you didnt reply my mail and i dunno whether it's because you didnt get it or you havent been online or what. i hope you are okay.  it really was nice seeing you the other day. i had no idea you grew so tall.  i was supposed to go back singapore next week for a fren's wedding, but my father didnt let me go. he didnt really give a reason. i was hoping id see you again then. guess not.  back to studying again...and am enjoying it this year cos i'm not as lost as last year. and i just bought a brand new stethoscope!! i'm so proud of it you know. like it's a symbol that i'm getting closer to achieving my dream or something.   hope to hear from you.

      welcome to the real world,..no red carpets shall be staged for u, nor ladies with rose petals to grett you.. just some clothes and an identity card to say that its you. well well,..seems that as one grows older, reality bites deeper. am gettintg the hang of it =P ok, am having a movie marathon ever since the long medical leave. watched 12 movies,..two more in the cinemas,..reign of fire and a mafia thingy(well people forgets) let see, seems that patches of these movies are bringing sense into me,... well,..am pretty awaken,, seems that the phrase "wat goes around comes around"(art of war) seems to be bugging me,.. every action will have a reaction had my blues of courting. seems that one will never be satisfied with something, there will always be another that one will want.well, thats wats happening to me,...am being choosy,..too choosy actually. i dunno, no one is perfect enough. or issit i'm not perfect enough. well, i've found out that both comes together. First, one tends to be choosy,.." is she the right one,..no, she dun look good enpugh, no, she burps,..no, her hair, i dun like her hair,..her speech,..the slang's too much",..but when one finds the "perfect" one..."hey,..i'm not good enough for her,..hey, maybe next time,..erm,..today is not a good day to ask her out,..hey eheyhey... seems that i'm never contented,..therefore,..its better to be alone,..well,..its not the right time thats for sure,.. There has always been a broplem with money,..have enough to go out on my own,..dun think i have the space for another,..not on my account that is,..its hard to ask a girl out if one dun treat her,..it seems so, not right. i dunno,.people say time have change, people are going Dutch, well,..i feel awkward if i dun treat a girl out, dun think i could manage if a girl treat me out,..Its not an EGo thing,..i dun do these stuffs in front of people, am not showing off,..maybe i'm brought up this way,..or maybe girls never prompt to go dutch,..maybe,..i dunno.  ok, am setting something in life,..knowledge wise,..since we live only once, i dun see the thing for specialisation without an all rounded education, i think one have to be taught all aspects of life, say it, nautical, engineering, maths, history, geography, architecture,religion, computing,arts, name it. with these broad aspects of knowledge i think one could find contentment in understanding,..philosophy is a great form knowledge which i very much like. Seems that its the basis of knowledge,..well it keeps me pondering, keeps me thinking, why this, why that.maybe its like this maybe its not. One thing for sure, one shouldn't spend each day on just one thing, but on everything. Socialising is a study, walking is a study, seeing is an observation, hearing is a disipline, everyday life is a great act, eating is a good testing, sleeping is a magnificant fantasy builder, talking is an interection, exchanging of ideas, well practically everything is something, its just up to one to actually make full use of knowing.   ok ,..hand's aching, gotta rest,..nightz,..i'll be back,.. to myself,>>> you are you,be somebody, not nobody, not just a name to be engraved but to be seek and known,..

      ok,..shoots,..am having morbid thoughts,.. dreamt about dead relatives and colleagues,(damn). seems that when someone leaves this realm,..theres a loss in both world,..the deceased gonna leave everything he/she once had posessed, and the people was left could only remember him by and wait for time to consume their fate,..funny episode in this dream is when one of my colleague tries to bring everything he have,..but ended with only a tombstone was quitee cute,..Things just gets deleted away (ni ariff main game banyak sangatlahni) but one part of the dream seems to be an eye opener,..my uncle have lots of multimedias(cameras,video cams, tv, Hi-fi,tv monitor), when he pass away, it seems that the relatives gets choosy in getting the things he left behind.well,i got myself a digital cam,..=p.but the funny part is that my supposed dead uncle seems to be ushering the relative to his stuffs.  another humourous death, my Warrant officer, a chinese, so called died, but his grave was in the muslim cemetery, he was surprised by this, and asked the rest of the tenants why issit his lot is so small. erm,..how come i could see the 'dead' talking on their graves.  Well, thats just a dream. but seems to last throughout the whole of my sleeping duration yesterday.but one thing for sure i've never been having thoughts of seeing them dead as soon as possible before.am having a big question mark for why issit that the 'deads' are people whom i seldom thought about.  okok,..today's eerie feeling, got goosebumps while reading the articles on september 11th. Suddenly theres a thought thst something will happen today or tomorrow, and i'm gonna be there to experience it.oh ya, one more thing, about the dream, i'm one of the dead also...thats why i'm writing this down....

      okz,..life is full of surprises Droplet of water, Ceasar or the hour. Contracted fever, Tongues turns sour.  Cyles of life, evolution and death. Spawning and marks,  Scar of birth.  King of own realm, Slave to others. One of its kind, similar to others.  Inevitable to the minutes, opaque to fate. catastrophies we are hooked, transparently walks through the eternal gate.  Whats sweet? whats nice? Bitterness a boon  and sweetness a bane in disguise. SO why not suffer, why not be in pain. Eternity last forever  And thats fate unchanged.

      well,..that depends now, on which group of gers u r with,..most of the gers i know are very friendly pple. of coz theres a few back stbbers here n there. Menjadi lumrah alam for those gossipy type to be around. So gotta choose wisely =p. Well,..religion wise, could group into category, those who really practise th religion n those who r pretending to. Basically i think that the latter just wanna find a "good" future hubby, a five minute thingy to show that they r religious. Wears the tudung for a month, back to square one after that... Most of the pple are repenting, starting off from scratches, u can see the steps they make, not too sudden, but slowly. Maybe its the school culture that make the local muslim mature religious wise slowly,.. erm..ni ada ura ura nak balik singapore lah ni,....=) aniwae, selamat berpuasa,..=)...a week to go to Raya...=)

      no la i have no intention to balik singapore..i think my chances there are limited...as in i wouldnt be able to reach my full potential without compromising my faith. i guess the same goes for any minority groups. so..i guess i better stick to where i am the majority. then, mebbe, after im done here, ill go back and see what i can do for the people there. but im not sure its a gd place to raise my kids. if i have any by that time. i mean, i very nearly screwed up my chances while i was there. i dowan my kids to go thru that. so...selamat hari raya and maaf zahir batin ok...

      Good thing for guys,a new experience, better perspective to the working world, i mean its like being given a job. National service exposes us to the real singaporeans thats inhibiting the country, i mean, one can't avoid the "gangsters, gays and such" makes one adapts to them, ..making us more open. For some it is the first time in their life, they are given a responsibility to do something, kind of making them more independent. Physically, its taxing but sculpturous, wat else, in my kind of work, i get to interect with the public, am able to understand the needs of the local population in a bird's eye view. wat else, NS foster friendship to a larger circle of cliques, could be good, or bad cliques, that depends on how one chooses friends. Erm, there's a bad thing abt NS, kind of waste one's time, especially in terms of education. a two to three years gap of being in another line kind of makes one loses focus. Honestly in country like singapore whereby everything well, almost is spoon fed, NS kind of counter the silverspoon legacy,  overall, NS is a good thing, but its up to individual to take advantage of it or perished with the negative influence. My opinion is to enjoy National service and try to excell in in, make oneself more competative, look at it as a free training to the real world, not a simulation,.... and dear, how are you?

      ha, had a new philosophy about life,.....  we are born on the beach our path is to the islands ahead we start off on the sandy ground, slowly moving to the gentle waves here we still have the sands to support us, legs first, then knee and up to the rest of the body. at a certain point we'll have to jump about, and starts to swim,.. if we give up swimming, we'll drown as we swim to the open ocean, the waves gets rougher if we tire off, we'll drown. be persistant and swim on, till we are near to an island we gotta choose the islands  some of the islands have beast that are carnivores,some herbivores or theres both some islands are small, some are big on the small island, we might get bored, so we'll move on to a bigger island on the bigger island, we migt get lost, so, we might find the beach and head off to another island till one finds utopia, its and endless cycle but still, throughout the journey, one must go on, not stopping, for one's survival depends on it.

      i think the situation in the world today is so sad and depressing we should do all we can to cheer ourselves up. i think ISlam is a great religion if the people go back to the roots of it, and put aside their egos and eccentricities adnd concentrate on strengthening the ummah instead of their own selfish gains.  i think iraq and palestine are countries which should be helped but i think the US since its lead by a complete dimwit-shouldnt be in charge of it. its so dangerous to put just one country in charge of running the world. i mean, all the guy seems to do is attack people-when his own country is at its lowest since 1987. i dunno. i just think its wrong. and i think everyone's so desperate that they themselves resort to violence.

      (live life the fullest) we'll never going back to the past, so why not play with the present.  ha, been doing lots of thinking lately. y bother to live, y bother to study, y bother to be a civilian, y this y that .. religion and its authenticity i mean seems that all religions are the product of history. Its validity is questionable. look at the current news. We are still not sure wats happening at IRAQ and what is written in history, US on war with iraq to salvage prisoned nation.hahaa,..right. we r looking at technology and communication at its peak. well, not trying to say that i dun belief in religion. just rational thoughts..guys,..am still a muslim =P  booo,..ariff, got lots of assignments to be done,................. bye

      yes love for someone can grow...but sometimes, you take the risk and chance it...but it just doesnt happen..not meant to be kinda thing... oh well that's life kan? my frens were saying how ironic it is that i used to tukar bfs so many times and now i havent had a bf for 2 whole years at a period of time where it matters most. i guess...now im more choosy who i go out with, knowing that he might be THE one...*ponder*

      haha tak main lah all this catfights all...if you want her you've got her...:)  i think ultimately the desicion in a catfight(?) belongs with the guy. if i was ever in one, i think ill just ask the guy to choose and if its not me then ill leave the happy couple alone. its not worth it you know? why force someone to be with you when he likes someone else? just a thought. so you dun think yr gf is the right one at the mo? haha i tell her then you know... not like i know her anyway. school's starting in 2 weeks. im starting to feel like ive wasted my hols doing nothing...i hate this feeling..it always comes when hols are about to end...bencinya... i wonder what studying in a hospital for real will be like..i mean yes ive had patients last year, but this year its like for real...scarynya....

      i dunno it feels unfair to be in a relationship and not give your whole heart when you can...i guess thats part and parcel being in a relationship la, its a risk you have to take.  fwah so you are gonna bring who down? for your concert that is. bring..kylie minogue..i bet a lot of adolecent boys would love that...:)

      hmm...i guess being open comes with time..i mean that's what it is for me lah...takes me quite some time to open up then when i do its like i give my whole heart kinda thing. which isnt really a gd thing cos then when the other person breaks my heart its like i have no heart left. :)

      ok wait...so what exactly have you been doing all this while? i think the st marine thing sounds good... i guess im biased cos my dad worked at the shipyard. i mean, put it this way, its the only thing you've got a scholarship for. and i think that makes matters alot easier cos you dun have to really think about tuition fees. cos i dun think you're really cut out for teaching, i dunno. what exactly is the scholarship for? yr degree pro is for what? im confused here, you've gotta spell things out a bit... take care
