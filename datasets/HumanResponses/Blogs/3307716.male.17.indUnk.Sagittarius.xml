      This just in. So when I applied to the summer program, they ask for you to send in your email adress, so your host family can contact you. My mom filled out the app, so she sent in her own email adress. So i get an email today at about 3:00 (it was sent earlier; i woke up at 3). She had recieved an email from one of the kids in my host family, with two pix attached, saying that she was the one in the white hat:   wow. I fully intend to get with both her and her hot friend by the end of the trip:). So I had a chorus concert today, and my parents came up to see it. So we got back to my room after the concert, and my parents told me that the application said that I should bring a nice little gift for the host family. So I suggested something like a t-shirt or a CD of american music, and my mom says, under her breath "or a thong." Lolz for all. suffice it to say, this should be a fun trip to germany. Holla at me

      So I was sitting there, minding my own business. I had just gotten back fromt he library and was soaked. There was a very heavy rain Monday evening, and I was completely soaked. There was quite a bit of lightning, but it seemed far away, using the flash-time delay trick. I was talking to some people online, when all of a sudden ZAP, crakle, FLASH! my screen goes black. We spent the next couple hours trying to figure out just what had happened, and whether there was anything on fire(we did see somehting smoking on the outside of the dorm). Anyway, the idea is that the internet router got fried, along with most people's network cards(including mine). Luckily,  Stuart has the best house councilers evar, and they bought everyone who needed them new network cards. So everyone lived happily ever aftar. Holla at me folks.

       urlLink  FOXNews.com - Foxlife - Out There - This Doesn't Taste Like Diesel Fuel   John O'Hare, 73, and his wife May, 69, of Glasgow had spent a week touring Scotland in their camper van and had parked at their final stop just a few miles from home, reports the Scottish Daily Record.  While they were sound asleep, a thief crept up to their encampment with a plastic hose and fuel container, intending to poach some diesel.  He apparently stuck one end in his mouth in order to get the siphon going â€” and, in the darkness, the other end not into the van's fuel tank, but into its septic chamber.  The next morning, the O'Hares stepped outside to find on the ground: the plastic hose; the fuel container; the entire contents of the septic tank; and a puddle of human vomit.

      So for the last 3 days, I was in Isham with a "Heavy growth of Non group A strep throat." What sucks worse than having a 103 degree fever is not having a 103 degree fever but not being allowed to see Pirates of Penzance, battle of the bands (though the lound hardcore rocking would probably have hurt my head) or Prom): I now get to "work on my history paper" also known as procrastinating working on my history paper; I didnt get it done during the first couple days of my stay at isham. They gave me some penecillin and ibuprofin, and hopefully I will be better by Tuesday, when classes resume.  Oh, and btw erika, the instructions for hosting blogger on student are  urlLink here.

       urlLink Zombie RFID tags may never die - News - ZDNet : But when should the tag's tracking powers be turned off? Kill commands, as they're known, do exist. The idea is that when a shopper passes a certain point, any active RFID chip essentially shuts itself down (German supermarket Metro tried similar technology with its RFID rollout and was rather red-faced to find its kill commands were more like  nasty-kick-in-the-shins  commands).

      Blogger claims to have this thing that lets you send an email to a *secrect* address and automatically post it to your blog. I am taking a pause in my paper, partially to escape one of the "quiet rooms" in the PACC which arent actually that quiet. Thanks guys.

      So as I type, I am trying to build gcc on INSERT (which is like Damn Small Linux). It will probably not work, but its worth a shot and I dont want to go to sleep. So I am downloading gcc to student, then going to transfer it to my comp. The end result will hopefully be to build lufs to allow the my comp to mount folders on student locally, so that each restart doesnt require a new install of OpenOffice.org. Did i mention I am at home? so all of this is taking place through an ssh to student. God i am cool. On a more scholarly note, I just got a whole pile of work done on my history essay. Mein Vater and I went to Hahvahd and sifted through their impossibly large libraries (with comps similar to PA's, only with bigger monitors). I now have a grand total of 10 books, 11 if you count "The Quakers in America" which I now have 2 copies of. I have gotten the introductory paragraph mostly done, I just need to pretty it up a bit and give some of that neat "beyond your topic" crap that Westtown told me to do. I also have a 3-5 page English essay, another chapter of "Das Fliegende Klassezimmer" to read, and a couple days worth of math to catch up on (tho that isnt really that hard). It really makes me wish I had spent all that time studying rather than setting up this Blog:(

      Just wanted to let everyone know that I am using firefox and thunderbird in the PACC, off of my USB drive. In case you don't already know, firefox is a browser (like Internet Explorer, only it doesnt suck) and thunderbird is a mail client.   urlLink

      Just got it to properly host off student! Might be just slightly against the AUP, but since when did that stop anyone? I think it was just a matter of creating the right directory and chmoding it to 777 (prob not the best idea, but still). So now, all you loyal readers, I am online! I will include more stuff later (hopefully). But for now, I am off to do some homework (for once in my life;)

      I really need to get out of here. so its summer break and whoopee. Now i have the freedom to stay inside for 3 days in a row and watch tv/play GTA Vice City (an excellent game, may I add). I haven't spoken with another teenager (except on AIM) since school ended. I a leaving for DER VATERLAND (germany) in a week tho, should be excellent(see previous post). I should really call up some day student and have a crazy party or something. right. Anyway, enough with the self pity, I already tourtured Angela with enough of that, I did fix the family computer by reinstalling windoze (haha, im funny!) and almost got mine working under gentoo linux while watching the man show on an HDTV and "Paycheck" over Wifi. That was awesome. I'm goin to try the same tonight, but with "Shaolin soccer" which seems like a kinda crappy movie, but come on, you know thats all you thought about when u were little  and playing soccer. Unfortunately, it is the "subtitled" version, which means that the movie is in Chinese, with a text file of the translations!! How helpful. Well, this post has gotten long enough, and i want to eat something before it is 12 hours before my doctor's appointment tomorrow (2PM) so I will conclude this post with a joke: whats black and white and has a really hot host sister waiting in Germany? ME!! (work in progress) Holla at me

      I know I have not posted in a while, I have been in germany, and my host family's computer miraculously failed to accept my USB Flash Drive (which contains my preposterously secure password to this fine establishment). Anyway, I am working on a multi-part installment detailing my Reise nach Deutschland, but seeing as there is so much to tell, it will not be finished for a little while, and in the meantime I would like to update all of my fine readers with some stuff. I am working on a website on which to host pictures from germany that myself and others took. There are a few small obstacles, such as the fact that Apache (the software) is being a bitch right now, but man always triumphs vs. machine. You can check out my work in progress at http://209.6.202.247/ but for a little while it will be a lot of nothing. In other news, my cousin Benjy, his brother Ollie, and my Aunt Barbara came stateside to chill for a couple days. Its okay, but Benjy and I do not have too much to say to each other, so the day is kinda boring. He doesnt seem too interested in watching white text scroll up a black background. Go figure. Saw Spider-man 2 today, which was good. I don't think it was quite a 95% that  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  gave it. The action was solid, but it got way too mushy by the end. I may see it again, i think it was that good, like Shrek 2.
