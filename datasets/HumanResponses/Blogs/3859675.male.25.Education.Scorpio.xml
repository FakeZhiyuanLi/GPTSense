						   &nbsp; Well, this week, I am so tried of summer break. I am just waiting for school to begin so I can have a small break. I mean I need something more to do then just taking the kids (nephew Kevin age 6, niece Trinity age 4) to the movies, and figuring out more about my computer. Today we saw the “Cat in the Hat,” I didn’t like it.   My best friend and fellow brother in the Lord, Owen, has gone on a weeklong mission trip to Mexico. He went with some others from his church, Lighthouse. He left Saturday and should be back latter this week. I hope all goes well for him.  I went to church Sunday morning and found out that my pastor, Pastor Jim, has asked the church board for a 6 month leave because of health related problems. I know Pastor Jim has been sick before and he had an accident a few weeks ago and that has not helped him. The church board has granted his leave and now he is at home, I think, healing and getting better.

						   &nbsp; The last few days I have been wondering, “what will I do as a job when school is over?” some of you may know, I go to ISU (Idaho States University) and am majoring in American Studies with the idea of transferring into the ISU Teacher-Education program.&nbsp; Well I found out I may not be a good teacher, as in doing it by all and myself. Long story. I have been trying to figure out what I can do.   Well, tonight in study (Jay’s group), the lesson we watched talked about the job Jesus held, working with wood. It seems that wood wasn’t used a lot back in his day. By looking at the buildings and household things, and ect., we call see everything was made of stone. Jesus was a stone carver. Now that was something to think about?  Well, by talking about Jesus’ job, I began thinking about what I will do as a job.  *What skills do I have? Well, skills are learned in school and are given by God. All of my college classes are in the areas of Teacher-Education, Political Science, Literature, and History. I believe God has given me the natural ability to break down things that is hard to understand and to make it simpler. I do not know for sure.  *What is my calling? I know my calling has something to do with the “youth.” I always thought I was meant to be a Youth Pastor. Even helped out at my church with the Youth Group when I was 1st saved (age 15) and even became a Sunday School teacher for some teaching the high school class over at the church.   *What is my desire? Well my desire is to follow Jesus. I want to give Him everything. I love to teach others and help them to learn.  &nbsp;I am still trying to figure things out and will let you all know when I figure it all out. I just need a lot of prayer on this issue.

						   This song has been going in and out of my head fo the last few days. I think it’s freash in my head because I am feeling this way.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEN THE MUSIC FADES (THE HEART OF WORSHIP)&nbsp;  When the music fades, all is stripped away,&nbsp;And I simply come;&nbsp;Longing just to bring something that's of worth&nbsp;That will bless your heart,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (bridge)  I'll bring you more than a song,&nbsp;For a song in itself&nbsp;Is not what you have required.&nbsp;You search much deeper within&nbsp;Though the way things appear,&nbsp;You're looking into my heart&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (chorus)  I'm coming back to the heart of worship,&nbsp;And it's all about you,&nbsp;All about you Jesus.&nbsp;I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it,&nbsp;When it's all about you,&nbsp;All about you, Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King of endless worth, no one could express&nbsp;How much you deserve.&nbsp;Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours,&nbsp;Every single breath&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(now go to the bridge)&nbsp;

						   “I like to drink out of the toilet.” This is what my nephew told me as he was joking.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hello. I have been busy with a lot of things. Last night I spent 5 hours writing letters to folks. I didn’t notice the time go by. I just got home from a great Bible Study Fellowship at Jay’s house. God is really re-teaching me the meaning of fellowship. The importance of it is needed for our Christian lives. I learned tonight that fellowship was highly needed in the early church.  &nbsp;  Not much is going on instead of going to Fellowship, Summer Movie Matinees, and ya, forgot to tell you, last week I saw Spiderman 2. I loved that movie. I just don’t like that they don’t go by the comics and all. It makes us, who know all about the comic storylines sad a little. But it was a nicely done movie. The best I have seen in years.&nbsp;

						   The night air is kind of dry in southern Idaho. Oh great now I am thirsty thinking about the dry air. This summer is the hottest, well I don’t know for sure, summer I have spent in Idaho. I heard something about the sun and its direction with the Earth or something, I don’t know, the weather is just strange.   Question: What do you do if you don’t like the weather in Idaho? Answer:   Just wait 5 minutes and it will change.  It seems to be true. I once saw it snow, well looked like snow, just in May, and now it’s July. Wow, the weather, I sometimes wonder what God was thinking when he made it. I just know that it is interesting and can’t wait to find out why God made things the way they are. The only answer I can think of is,   “For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving” (1 Timothy 4:4).  I just like looking up to the stars and wonder how everything is made, what a perfect design the Father has made. I mean if we were made different, like an organ somewhere else in our bodies, and it was not connected perfectly, then we would not be around. I just wish I were half the designer Jesus is.

						   I don’t know why but I just feel like singing.   *hums a little*  I must be happy and all. Family life is getting interesting and my life in God is doing well. I feel good tonight. I have been joking round and fellowshipping with some Brothers and Sisters tonight. I don’t have much to say tonight but I am just trying to continue to gig deeper into the meaning of love.  In study tonight we talked about a video. *can’t remember name* but it was about the area where Jesus did His teachings and all and we read the Sermon on the Mount and all. Which is one of my favorite speeches of all times. Basically read Matthew chapters 5 to 7.   Well, to make a long story short, the beginning of the speech, known as the Beatitudes, links up well to what God has been teaching me about love and all. I write more latter about how, but I am tried and wanted to write this down before I go to bed and all.

						   I don’t know why but the day seems strange to me. I wish I had something fun to do. But all is good because God is good. I mean he has been teaching me about love. Not just the simple lines everyone knows,   “Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” 1 Corinthians 13: 5-7  I wanted to dig deeper and have spent the last week looking for a verse that talked about love in more detail, but all I had to do was read down to a few verses.   “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.” 1 Corinthians 13:1-3  These are simple words and phases that tell what love is supposed to be. But the question I have been asking is how do I love? How can I dig deeper into understanding this? I think I have found an answer, or a good idea. I need to start loving others. But now the question is how do I start loving others. The only thing that comes to my mind is to be kind, understanding, and to live in the truth as verse 5-7 suggest.  My goal is changing for this summer, now I want to learn to love others, and the way to do this is my getting out more and allowing myself to have more fellowship. I think I am on the right path, just hate waiting but I know Christ will carry me during the hardest times.

						   Hello, this is the first time I am doing an online journal. I want to do it to help encourage others, let them know how I am doing in my struggles, and how life is doing. I have been struggling with sin as always but I know God is faithful whenever I need Him.   I have been out of school for the summer and have not much to do until mid-August. I just need to find some good books to read and to start reading them. All I have been doing this summer so far is trying to lose some weight, get healthier, and taking the kids (my nephew, and my 3 nieces) to the Summer Matinee Movies every week.   I have also been trying to get together with some brothers and sisters-in-Christ to encourage them. It seems to me that the summer seems to be an interesting time. It seems that folks have a harder time growing spiritually; I have been having that problem as well. I have been finding harder to deal with life because I have so much free time because school is out and all. The problem is boredom can bring sin, I am currently looking for more to do until August.

						   I don’t know why I haven’t written in a week or so.  BAD NEWS: Well I think my dog, Baby, may be on her last legs. I hate that sometimes, that we became so connected to our pets and the something happens and they die. She hasn’t yet, but my family and I are trying to make her feel better until the time comes. Besides the fact Baby is sick, life is still good. I just feel like I should do more. But I cannot, besides pray and hope and to be ready for the time.  GOOD NEWS: Life is good but the whole pet thing. I will miss her. I don’t know what to really say or do, but I do know that we need, that I need, to look toward the positive side of life. To see the goodness that God created.
