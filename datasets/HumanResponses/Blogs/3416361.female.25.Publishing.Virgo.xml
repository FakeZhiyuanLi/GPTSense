      He seemed to have magical powers and wowed us with his intuition.  "Pick a two digit number, any two digit number..." he said.  Sadly, we discovered he was a shonky shaman wanting to  flog some potions and talismen   urlLink

      Yep, buses are safer than...... base jumping .   urlLink      Especially when it's a  Brand spanking new  Double-decker monster.  3am.  Blackness. CRUNCH.  Somewhere near Bolivia.  The bus zigzags for a bit and then stops.    Que paso? (What had happened?)    Our driver  Took a snooze  At the wheel  And   Hit a tree!    While the front windscreen  Was smashed,  Noone was hurt.  Not physically anyway.   (The bus in the photo is just symbolic)  '15th April'.

        urlLink    Women's fashion is phenomenal! This woman has all the trademarks: > A colourful, stripey bag which probably carries her bubba > Two plaits with woollen extensions > A daggy cardy (although an alpaca wool shawl is just as common) > A falda gordo (fat skirt) with 5 layers! > A suede bowler's hat (tilted for singles and flat for the rest) Given that they wear this day in, day out, you can imagine the curious aroma that wafts about at Tupiza bus station!

      The one on the right is a savvy businessman. A very moving emotional performance (complete with bubbling booger) convinced me that six pesos would be the bare minimum to get his mug in this photo. The girl was happy with a melted caramello.   urlLink
