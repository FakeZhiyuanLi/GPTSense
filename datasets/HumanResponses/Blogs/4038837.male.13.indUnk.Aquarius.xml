       There were two more boring indian parties/socials today. One was a lunch party. There was nobody there I knew except for one little kid. Everyone else is gone. Later there's another party at night and the night parties go on forever and ever. Dev is at Ohio, Sid is in India, and lots of other people are scattered elsewhere around the globe. It seems everybody is somewhere except me. The boringness (is that a word?) of summer continues on. Seriously...where is CY-TAG when you need it? I spent a lot of time editing my blog today. I added a time cursor. I also added some music. The song is "Swing, Swing" by the All-American Rejects. If you have a suggestion for a different song, suggest a song and put it as a comment. I added some background fireworks but they were kind of annoying so I took them out. I also added this popup when you enter the blog that says welcome to my blog and make sure to sign my guestbook and other stuff like that. I added some "mini" games on the sidebar if viewers get bored of reading my blog. I could understand why you would get bored reading about my life. I added a couple of other stuff, too. Well... I've got to go get ready for the party.

        It's another boring day. Yesterday, I watched the Kerry convention. It was pretty boring. One funny thing is that when he was talking about Edwards, he was like "This son of a millworker..." It seemed like he was going to say something a little different. j/k. I found out how to do this cool thing called audioblogging. You can call this number and record your post and it is posted to your blog. It's pretty cool. I also added a guestbook, a hit counter, and a search to my blog so make sure to take a look at them and sign the guestbook. The summer's starting to get kind of boring but I don't want school to start. I just want to go to school to talk to some of my friends I haven't seen for a while. Nobody really wants to talk online anymore. They'll answer but it seems like I have to keep the conversation going. Most conversations just go:      Me: Hey   Them: Hey   Me: What's up?   Them: nm u   Me: same      After this, most people will just stop talking. it seems like I have to talk to them for them to talk back. This isn't with everybody, though. There are a couple people who are actually pretty fun to talk to. Moving on...   The days just seem to be getting longer. I really don't know what else to say.

How long have you known me?  4. When and how did we first meet?  5. What was your first impression?  6. Do you still think that way about me now?  7. What do you think my weakness is?  8. Do you think I'll get married?  9. What makes me happy?  10. What makes me sad?  11. What reminds you of me?  12. If you could give me anything what would it be?  13. How well do you know me?  14. When's the last time you saw me?  15. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't?  16. Do you think I could kill someone?  17. Describe me in one word.  18. Do you think our friendship is getting stronger/weaker/or staying the same?  19. Do you feel that you could talk to me about anything and I would listen?  20. Are you going to put this on your journal and see what I say about you?

        I'm really, really bored. There's nothing to do today. I had piano but after that i've just been sitting around all day. I can't believe school starts in less than a month. I don't want summer to ever end. I just want to go back to CY-TAG instead of school. I don't know what else to say. I guess I'm out.

        I just got back from Lost Island. It was waaaaaay fun. My sister and I went with Dev and Nina. They have this new ride (a toilet bowl)&nbsp;from last year where you go around this bowl like thingy and when you get to the bottom, you go down this chute thingy into water. It's hard to explain. It's funner than it sounds though. There were a lot of other cool rides, too. I'll post a picture of the map of the park with all the ride names later.&nbsp;There was some pretty good food there, too.They had Dippin' Dots there and I haven't had it forever. They are like a ton of small balls of ice cream in a cup. It is really good. After we ate, Dev and I had this crazy idea that if we took out more air from our tubes, we would go faster. I think the chlorene was getting to our heads.&nbsp;Obviously, we were wrong so we went back to keeping the air in the tubes. Then, we went go-karting for a little bit. It was my first time. I've never been go-karing before. After Lost Island, Jasmine and Nina went to a movie but I couldn't go because I have Karate at 8:00 so Dev didn't go either. That's pretty much it for today.

        I just figured out that as soon as I get a blogger it seems like everyone now has a livejournal or a xanga. Kate has a blogger, too so I'm not all alone. Yesterday was pretty boring. I didn't do much all day. Towards like 5:00 I played tennis with Dev, Nina, and Jasmine. Then Dev came over for a little bit and we set stuff on fire. Then, I had Karate at 8:00. I didn't do so well because I ate right before and I realized that you probably shouldn't eat right before you exercise. But anyways, it started out pretty good but there was a ton of way hard exercises. Then, we had to do break faults. Break faults is where we learn how to fall. It's how you land so you don't get hurt. I was doing pretty good at the front, side, and back break faults but I stunk at the ones where we were thrown. It took me forever to finally get it right. I felt kind of embarassed because I'm a brown belt and even blue belts could do it. That's pretty much it for karate. It was a boring day as usual. I think I'm going to Lost Island (a water park) tomorrow, though. So I'm looking forward to that.

        I just made my blog. Everyone has one so I decided to make one too. Since this is my first post, I'll inform you of all the stuff I've done this summer. The beginning was pretty boring. I just sat around, watched TV, and played on the computer all day. 2 days before CY-TAG, I got a laptop. It's a Toshiba M35-S320. CY-TAG started on June 13. This was my 3rd year at CY-TAG. CY-TAG was awesome this year.&nbsp;Sam and Shrikar were the only people I knew from last year. My roommate was Kavin. I knew him before CY-TAG so that made things easier. I took Chemistry this year. Weekends were the most fun. We could sleep in whatever room we wanted. I liked this year of CY-TAG better than last year. A ton of people came back from last year for the last dance. Emily, John, Abby and some other people came back. Besides class, CY-TAG was great.&nbsp;I never wanted to leave. I hope a lot of people come back next year.&nbsp;After CY-TAG, I had Order of the Arrow for Boy Scouts. I couldn't eat or talk for 24 hours. I didn't mind the eating or the talking part. In the morning, we had to do like 8-10 hours of service. It was waaaaaaaaaay boring and there were a ton of mosquitoes. After Order of the Arrow was over, they gave us a ton of food. After Order of the Arrow, I haven't been doing much. I've just been playing a lot of tennis&nbsp;with Dev and seeing some pretty good movies. I had a tennis tournament on Thursday and Friday. I did horrible. That 's pretty much my summer so far.

       Well, I'm starting to get used to the fact that school is about to start. We're leaving for San Diego later today. so I already have all my school stuff packed and everything. I'll be gone for like a week so I won't be editing for a while. The last couple of days have been really boring. There's been nothing to do except pack and go on the computer. At like 5:30 yesterday I went down to the Salvation Army volunteered there. I'm looking forward to San Diego. We are going to see some relatives there because it is my cousin's birthday and also an indian holiday is coming up on August 30th.Well, I've got to go finish packing. I'll try to post as often as I can in the next week or two.

       On Friday, Amit, Dev, and I saw AVP: Alien vs Predator. It was pretty good. Afterwards, we went tot the mall and looked around and stuff. Yesterday (Saturday), I went to the mall and bought some clothes and stuff and afterwards, Dev and I slept over at Amit's house. It was fun. In the morning, we went to Lost Island for the Cedar Valley Medical Specialists picnic thingy. It was really fun but it started to get boring after a while because Lost Island only has like 8 slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool. We spent about 3 hours there. Then, I went to Ben, Andrew, and Alex's Eagle ceremony. An Eagle is the highest rank of boy scouting. Later, there's another Indian party thing. That's about it.

       On Saturday, I had to go to Jasmine's dace Folk Festival thingy. They did a couple dances and stuff. It was at this park in Waterloo. Then, there was an Indian party at night. That's pretty much it for Saturday. On Sunday, Dev and I went to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. It was really funny. After the movie, I slept over at Dev's house. We played video games and stuff. Yesterday, we had a hose fight and it was awesome. We used the gardening nozzles and made forts and stuff.   We were way cold afterwards. That's pretty much it for the weekend. I can't believe school's about to start. Atleast it's something to do. Right now is the most boring part of the summer and there is never anything to do. I guess I'm out.

       I didn't wake up until 10:00 today. Jasmine had some people come over at 1:00 for dance practice and they didn't leave until like 7:30. I had to do the music because they couldn't or wouldn't do it themselves. Can you imagine? 6 hours of indian songs. It's a nightmare. So then, when they left, Jasmine told me that she needs a file splitted, converted, and burned by tomorrow (or today since it's after 12:00). So I spent an hour doing that. That's pretty much it for today. Tomorrow (or today) there's a karate kamiza. It's where a black belt get's promoted. They're not boring it's just that your feet fall asleep when you sit down forever. It's supossed to be unlike any we've seen before because the black belt getting promoted is like a 7th dan (degree). So I guess that's it.

        Today was a fun day. The morning was kind of boring but at 3:00 the girls had dance practice so Dev came over. First we played some ping-pong but we got bored so we made these firecracker things.          STORY TIME :           We took 5 sparklers and put all the powder in a plastic container. Then, we put some flour on it and put some Axe deoderant and aerosol and stuff. It took us like 1/2 hour to get the thing to light. When we did get it to light, there was a fire about 1 foot in diameter and sparks were like 2 feet high. It was awesome. The workers who are working at the house next door were laughing at us.  That's the firecracker story.

        I went to the dentist today. I see my dentist everyday because it is my mom but today was different. I actually had to go to the dentist literally. I didn't have any cavities but I had to have one tooth sealed because one of my sealents (?) fell off. Basically, I just got my teeth cleaned. They put fluorine and stuff. I'm a huge gagger so I hate going to the dentist. But on the bright side, Dev is back from Ohio. He said it was pretty cool. He went to Cedar Point and went on the world's fastest and tallest roller coaster. Anyway, I'm somewhat excited and somewhat sad that school is about to start. I'm excited because I get to see everybody again and there is finally something to do on the weekdays. I'm sad because I don't want to go back to school and let the stress start. I like stress-free summer. But most of all, I don't want homework. Ninth grade is starting and now I actually  have  to get good grades if I want to get into college. So that's pretty much it for today. The usual boring stuff.

       ^Doesn't that sound like the name of a science video you would watch in school? I think all that Bill Nye we had to watch in school got into my head. Anyways, today was an okay day. I watched Red vs Blue a lot today. I finally finished watching the second season. I can't wait for the third season to start. I'm thinking of buying the DVD of the first and/or second season. I'm not sure. The weather was really wierd today. First, it was pretty good weather up until 5:00. Then, at like 5:30, the sky got almost pitch black and it started pouring. I wasn't expecting it because I didn't watch the weather for this week. So it's been pouring since then and there was a Severe Thunderstorm Watch and all that stuff so I figured that this font color would fit the weather. Hopefully the weather will clear up by tomorrow morning. I hate waking up to rain. By the way, here are some changes I made to the blog: 1. I put a button at the top of the page so you can turn the clock cursor off because I know some people probably get annoyed by it. 2. I put this swirly thing in the taskbar and window title. I might have said this before. 3. I'm thinking of changing the music. If you have any suggestions, post it as a comment. Also, I made a post earlier with some question thingy for readers to fill out so if you want to you can fill that out and put it as a comment. That's basically it for today.

       Not too much to do today. I sat around again and went on the computer a lot. I worked on my blog a little bit. I added this little swirly thingy on the title and the toolbar. Otherwise, I've just been watching TV and stuff. I had karate today. I got my hakyma (I don't know how to spell it). It is like this skirtish thingy we have to wear when we are doing our weapon kata. It is for etiquette. Then, I ran a weapon kata. I ran with a yawara not a hambo today. Nobody probably knows what i'm talking about. A yawara is a small weapon with points on the end. It is a practise weapon. A hambo is basically a mid-sized stick, about 3/4 of the size of a walking stick/cane. Moving on, piano is over for the summer until school starts. Next week, we are babysitting/dogsitting Addy. Addy was the dog we gave Jasmine for her birthday. After about 1 year, we decided we couldn't take care of her anymore because our schedules are so busy. So we gave it to our neighbors who have the same kind of dog. Jasmine gives Addy a walk and goes to visit Addy every once in a while. Anyways, we are dogsitting her next week. Atleast it's something to look forward to.

       Today, our parents made us go to Des Moines to look at appliances for the new house. It was sooooooo boring. I really don't like going to buy appliances and things for the new house when I've already made it clear to my parents that I'm not interested and I don't mind how the house turns out as long as it's done soon. I just stayed in the car and watched Red vs Blue most of the time on my laptop until the battery ran out. Then, I finally went inside and looked at the appliances and stuff. After 5 minutes, I just went to the home theater section and watched T.V. Finally, we left. On the way out, I was amazed to see that there was a car dealership that was selling Porsches. I was like "Whoa....Porsches in Iowa?" Afterwards, we went to the Montage. It was pretty good. They have really good appetizers and dessert. That's basically the end of my boring day.
