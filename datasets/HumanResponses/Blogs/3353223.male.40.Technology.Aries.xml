      Well, time moves on and things change.  We have a visitor with us at the moment. Eileen is from Pauline's home town and is currently living in Queenstown. She has popped up to Christchruch for a short visit.  Eileen arrived at the house last night and joined us for dinner with Joshna, who attends the same course as Pauline. Joshna is slightly frightening since she has knows the script of The Princess Bride far too well, shades of Alex, I think.

      At work things move on. I seem to have gleaned enough undertsanding of the existing code to make better progress. I managed to get a bit more working.  We had a works evening out. Unfortunately, Steve and Phil could not be there but Simon, Helen and myself managed to turn up. We were joined by Pauline, Sally, Wayne, Judy and Helen's husband. We had quite a few drinks at The Bohemian before moving onto dinner at Thai Thai on Colombo Street. Only Wayne, Judy, Simon, Pauline and myself managed to go to Thai Thai - Sally had to leave for the babysitter and Helen and her husband also went home.  The food was as good as always - Red & Green curries, Paed Thai and Chilli & Garlic Seafood with Jasmine Rice. Really tasty and plenty of it. Simon said he felt over stuffed but that isn't too surprising since he also had a big lunch today. Pauline was also stuffed since she had devoured a double and triple cheeseburger at lunch.  We had a great evening out. Pauline and Judy seem to be hitting it off very well.

      Finally managed to get the hang of this API at work. Progress is a bit slow with the legacy GTK stuff still in place but progress is being made.  I met Pauline at The Yellow Rocket Cafe in Cathedral Square for a lunchtime coffee and a bagel. They serve good strong coffee. We mused over our housing situation and looked at the latest copy of Harcourt's Bluebook. As usual, the best ones (i.e. the ones we like) either cost too much or are only available at Auction!  We met with a mortgage broker this evening to see what we could, or could not, borrow towards a house purchase. Seems like we have a pretty open choice when it comes to lenders in the current market, given our situation. All we need to do now is work out whether we want to buy, or build. Building seems preferable but will certainly be a lot more stressful!

      Spent most of the evening in waiting for a Mortgage Broker to turn up so that we can discuss the finer details of what we can, and cannot, afford to buy/build. I ended up reading Multitool LINUX instead.  Signed up with Z-talk for low calling rates so I can call Allan in Eindhoven.

      The blog starts here!  We're living in Christchurch now and I now work for Bluewater Systems Ltd. Pauline has signed up for a course at Canterbury University in Computational Tools for Management Science.  We have done a bit of snow boarding at Mount Hutt. Both of us fall down a lot but, so far, we have both escaped major injury. Pauline hurt her wrist on the first trip and then banged her shoudler on the second but has manged to avoid serious injury so far.  My old schoolfriend Philip visited us the other week and he came to the mountain with us. He is an intermediate level skier so he spent most of his time on a full ski pass, unlike myself and Pauline who are still on novice passes. I sometimes suspect that this will be where we are at the end of the season!  E-mails sent to Bob and Allan to see how they are getting on. Spent some time playing with the e93 editor for Windows.  Well, that's the first one done, wonder if I can keep this sort of thing going?

      The car was found by the police tonight. They called me up and I dutifully ran out to look it over. It is difficult to list all the things that may now be wrong with it since I'm not all that hot on the underlying mechanics of cars. However, the thieves managed to destroy the driver-side door lock. Once more they destroyed the ignition barrel. There is something at the bottom of the ignition barrel which prevented me from inserting my key, so I could not start the car to see if it would run properly. They also decided to steal the carousel for the CD player in the boot as well as the CDs in it. Amazingly enough they left my badminton racquet and YSL fleece in the back seat. Clearly the fleece sported the wrong logo and they aren't badminton fans.  The car was uplifted and taken to the breakdown company's secure warehouse.  Then the police rang me again and said they had caught the individuals who were in the car. Would I like to pop along a review the stolen property they had recovered?  So off I popped.  A few block later I was face to face with the thieves. Well, at least with two of them. One was standing on the kerb, looking at his feet; the other was in the back of the police car staring at his knees. I couldn't say that I recognised either of them but the kid in the back of the car was the same complexion as the driver of the car on Saturday.  I didn't recognise anything apart from the car air freshener. They asked me if I recognised the car cigarette lighter but since I don't smoke I never noticed it as missing when I looked in the car.  The police had picked up two others but drove them off just as I turned up to review the loot.  They were all kids aged 14-15 years of age. They had admitted bering in the car. What amazes me is that they were still riding around in it on Monday night. This means that they had kept it secure for two nights. I guess it must have been a fun car to drive?

      If you see a black Subaru Legacy GT Wagon with registration ZL1852 please call the police because it has been stolen.  We parked the car on Oxford Terrace near the Centenial Leisure Pool yesterday morning at midday. We were having brunch with some friends at The Bohemian. After that we went into town to do some shopping. Just as we were walking back to the car, Pauline asked me what or registration plate was as she had just seen our car pull into the car park for the Leisure Pool. We ran into the car park to see what was going on, only to find two young lads (approx 15-17 years old) sitting in the car with the doors open. They were waiting for three of their friends to get into the car.  As we got to them, and Pauline shouted "get out of the f**king car" they slammed the doors shut. The three guys outside the car ran off; two in one direction, one in another. We tried to get the doors open but they had locked them. They did a 90 degree reverse, nearly running us over in the process. The car revved loudly as they failed to get it into  drive  and ended up sticking it in  neutral . However, that failure didn't last long and they floored the accelerator and zoomed out of the car park, turning east onto Armagh Street.  We phoned the police and they put out an all points about the theft but nothing came of that. Some officers turned up, interviewed us, and another witness or two before giving us a lift home. One of the witnesses was a off-duty police officer, he had seen the car tear off but wasn't able to get it. He did see two supicious youths on Armagh Street that looked a bit shifty and got a verbal id out of one of them but none of this would hang together in court because he did not see them attempting to get into our car; he had just seen the car tear off out of the car park and some kids fleeing from the scene.  Nasty little lads.  Not only did they steal our car and nearly run us over but they gave up a good chance to get off scot free by just leaving our car and running for it. So in addition to stealing our car, they could have hurt us with their dangerous reversing, and they gave up any chance of mitigation by running from the car when we called on them to get out of it. They just sealed the car up and drove of. Clearly, they were intent on stealing it.  Now, this all comes about 5 weeks after the last attempt to steal the car from Chapter Street. That time, the cheeky scamp managed to get into the car but failed to get it started. He just ruined the ignition barrel, leaving me with 390 NZD of car repair bills. That time I lost my sunglasses (200 NZD), mu daysack (approx 80 NZD) and Cross pen giftset from my last UK employer. My pen giftset was recovered a few days later but nothing else of value was.  This time we had so little in the car. A badminton racquet, an Yves-Saint Laurent fleece and some CDs - Pulp Fiction, OMD and A Brief History Of Nearly Everything.  Our ideal scenarios is that they crash the car, into a tree, hopefully, writing it off in the process whilst hurting themselves significantly so that we can get a full payout on our insurance so that we can buy a decent replacement car. Our next door neighbour says that there are a good few 250T Legacy Wagons on the market these days. They perform about the same as the 2.0L GT and are a lot easier (i.e. cheaper) to maintain.  Knowing our luck, the car will turn up in a few days but with only minor damage. If that happens we need a complete inspection of the car to see if there is any other  hidden  damage that might manifest itself later on. If so, we need everything fixed now, not later.  Mind you though, 10K for a replacement car would buy us a better car today than the one we had due to the recent drop in Subaru prices.

      Well, what did I do this weekend?  I finally re-read  urlLink Programming Ruby  by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt. I bought this book a few years back and have only managed to get around to reading it again. Ruby is a very impressive language. It is fortunate to have Andy and Dave as advocates. They write well about it and use simple, but powerful, examples to show its power.  Andy and Dave are the  urlLink Pragmatic Programmers . Their first book  urlLink The Prgamatic Programmer: From Journeyman To Master  is a great read. When I first read it I was in something of a lull workwise. I had become jaded and was fed up with the continual stream of new technologies which were hurtling into my world. I was not very impressed by them and thought that many of them were nothing more than hype. Their book reassured me that I was not turning into some crusty old fogey who was always looking back. I was not being a naysayer, or looking backward. I was applying critical judgement to what I saw and heard. The discomfort that I felt was tinged with a lot of experience.  When I was a young programmer, I thought that I could write code to do anything, if I felt inclined. As I got older, and acquired more experience, I began to realise that writing code is the last thing I should attempt to do. Taking time to understand your problem is so much mnore important. When I fully understand something, or when I get a good understanding, I generally end up writing code that is shorter, simpler and far easier to test.  Unfortunately, every few years , I forget this lesson and fall into a trap of thinking I may have some godlike genes within me. Naturally, I end up re-learning this lesson very soon thereafter. At least, I re-learn the lesson a bit more quickly than I used to.  My other pragmatic book this weekend, which I am only dipping into, is  urlLink Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS . I have read lots of CVS books and manuals. Andy and Dave's book is simple and workmanlike. It describes the philosophy of CVS which I consider to be important. However, it mainly follows a recipe-based approach with neat, small examples that beautifully illustrate complex points. I particularly liked section 6.11, Removing a change (pages 86-88), which describes how to use the -j option on update to back out previous changes that introduced defects into the code.  I still haven't finished reading Pragmatic Version Control but I am definitely going to have it sitting on my desk at work. It is just too damned handy not to have close to hand.  A wonderfully pragmatic weekend.

      Welcome to our newest addition to the household ... a Compaq 2577 Notebook. Very classy, and quite inexpensive. Unfortunately, it beat out the Sony that we looked at last weekend. Pauline bought a handy little rucksack carrier to go with it. She's loaded it up with her other Firestarter materials (i.e. The SPFE Handbook, Fire Dynamics and Enclosure Fire Dynamics). It weighs a bit but ... she's strong!

      I really need to change the time I play badminton. The gang of us that played at 6:30pm was quite big at one point but now we are down to an average of 5 people. The 8pm class is starting to look better with 20+ people playing most weeks and the quality of the players being very high. I finally managed to break into a sweat tonight when I played with 3 of the other regulars (a grand total of 8 tonight).  That 8pm class looks a lot better; ... but I reckon I need to upgrade my racket ;-)

      You know how it is? You decide you can't make do with dialup any more so you 'upgrade' to ADSL. Well, that's what I did around about a month ago. I took my pay rise and decided to use it for my monthly ADSL charges. Thankfuilly, my employer has a business account with one of the main electronics distributers in New Zealand so I was able to purchase a  urlLink DSL-504  router at a good price. At the time  urlLink Dick Smith Electronics  was offering it for around $198; their current price is $228, I got mine for $178. Like I said, a good deal.  I had some initial set up problems. The biggest one being that I kept getting an authentication error when I trioed to connect to my ISP (Xtra). This was because my ADSL service got installed two days early and my ISP hadn't activated my ADSL account. A short phone call soon fixed that problem. They enabled my account when I called in and I got connected straight away.  I did have an intermittant problem which was caused by the way Telecom New Zealand has changed their DSLAM setup which wasn't totally compatible with my router but a quick e-mail to D-Link's technical support sorted all that confusion out. My expereince of D-Link's support has been very good. They generally know what they are talking about and deliver explanations that I can understand.  I wish I could say the same for TNZ's support.  The trouble with telcos, and TNZ in particular, is that all they really want to do is send you a piece of paper every month demanding some money from you. TNZ, in particular, wants to give up its engineering heritage and become a billing organisation. The mere fact that their business relies on an engineering infrastructure seems to be an annoying burden.  Anyway, their support is not always the best. I spoke with one guy last night who would not believe that the Link light on my router was on. Once I convinced him of this he became a bit more reasonable. Actually, this was the second guy that I had spoken with that night. The first guy told me he was the only one working there yet I get someone else 10 minutes later.  The first guy, Alastair, knew what he was talking about. He told me that he would reset the port on the exchange. That would take about 15 minutes to happen so I should have a cup of tea or something and come back to it in around 15 minutes time. So I thanked him and went off to make a cup of tea.  I then had one of those "ah, ha" moments and decided to watch my router's status web page to see what would happen. Lo and behold, about 5 minutes later I saw a "Physcial line error" which means the ADSL line has gone down, or been unplugged. Great I thought, another few minutes and I''l bee connected again.  That was not to be. My router went from "Physical Line Error" mode to "Connecting" mode and there it stayed for quite some time. This was when I decided to call the Jetstream (Telecom's brand name for ADSL) support people again. And this time I didn't get Alastair, but someone else.  Now I am sure he knows what he is doing but frankly I don't think we 'clicked' and this made things a bit more difficult. He was the one that wouldn't believe me when I said my Link LED was on. We spent a lot of time getting nowhere. He offered to send a "contracter" out to the exchange and then onto my house if they could not find a problem at the exchange. Naturally, I would have to pay them $81 if the countracter found my equipment at fault. I declined this offer. Frankly it did not seem worth it, especially when I have to work and can't sit around at home for someone to eventually turn up.  What I wanted to do was try and solve the problem then and there from the ground up - i.e. my Link LED is ON so the physical connection is there, can you see my connection attempts, etc. But this just cannot be done. TNZ have very little insight into anything above the bottom of the protocol stack. They can tell me if I am connected but they cannot, apparently, tell me if my connection attempts are getting through but being rejected. Only the ISP can do that and they aren't the ISP.  Of course anyopne that knows TNZ and Xtra knows that Xtra is a business unit of TNZ. Xtra charges are billed on my monthly phone bill. They are meant to be a separate unit but they are just another part of TNZ to me; albeit a slightly more hip one.  In the end, I hooked up the analog modem and dialed in the old fashioned way. That let my partner submit her university course assignment. A little later I disconnected the modem, and tried the ADSL service again. And what do you know, it was working again!  Maybe that cup of tea, and a biscuit of course, would have been a good idea.  As it is I find this complete lack of ability to diagnose faults a real worry. This is meant to be an always on service but it doesn't feel like that.  A friend of mine in Australia who is in the know about all things IP, tells me that Telstra customers have the same kind of problem. The ADSL link just stops working and the best thing to do is turn off the router, make a cup of tea, drink the cup of tea and then come back to things and turn the router on. Telstra and TNZ apparently use the same DSLAM vendor so it isn't surpising that TNZ customers suffer the same problems as Telstra's Australian customers.  Still, I find it all very annoying ... Now where's the kettle, I fancy a cup of tea.

      I have just had a very frustrating afternoon trying to buy a notebook computer with my Partner.  My partner has started a distance learning course. She is about two thirds of the way through here first unit and the final exam is approaching. Unfortunately, she will be away on holiday when her exam starts. Being a distance learning course, the exam has been structured with distance learning in mind. All she has to do is download her exam materials one day and then submit her answers a week later. All very reasonable. Since she will be back in the UK at that time visiting relatives it makes sense to buy a notebook computer so she do her work whilst she is staying with her parents. All we need to do is buy a notebook computer for her to take with her. That doesn't sound too difficult, does it?  Well, yes it is, if the store staff manage to ignore you consistently for an hour or so.  We stayed in one of the shops for around 40 minutes looking at the notebooks that they had on offer. We tried several times to attract some interest from the staff but with no success. We went into the shop next door and had the same experience. On the way out of the second store we noted a particularly good deal on oil-filled gas heaters - it can get a bit chilly in the winter evenings here. So we went up to the counter to buy one and were completely ignored for the next 10 minutes. One of the staff even stood opposite us whilst he went through some invoices for someone else. Neither he, nor his colleague next to him, acknowledged our existence.  Do not come to New Zealand for a pleasant shopping experience. Shop staff here can be this rude on a regular basis and don't even realise that they are doing it. I must acknowledge that this was a Sunday which is a very busy shopping day. However, a polite "I'm sorry, I'm helping another customer at the moment, I'll be with you once I finish with them" would have gone a long way in terms of customer relations. As it was, it never happened. So guess what? We will not be buying anything from either of those shops. We are certainly not buying a laptop from them, nor that really good oil-filled heater deal they had on offer.  Do you think it is a coincidence that neither of these shops had any female staff working today?  So, one of the other branches of these chains will be getting our trade. There are plenty of them around town. The respective staffs of "Bond & Bond" and "Noel Leemings" stores at The Palms Mall will not be seeing us again.  Pity really, because I suspect the commission on a notebook computer is a bit better than that for a standard TV or washing machine.

      Well, here we go as I enter the world of blogging.  I manage to keep a daily notebook on what I do at work and I have managed to do that every work day for the last couple of years. I wonder how I will get on with this blog. I did try starting one before when I first moved to Christchurch from Wellington but I did not have the tools to make that easy - no high speed internet from home and no easy content manager of my own, just some simple scripts under Cygwin and VIM.  Perhaps things will be different this time around?

      I had breakfast this morning with my previous boss (lets call him XXX). He had just returned from the UK and suggested breakfast at Drexels whilst he was still running on UK time.  We got to talking about life, what we want to do and how we intend to achieve it. XXX is very interested in economics and would like to make a career out of it but where would he start on the salary scale? With a bit of luck he would get more than 40K NZD a year but he already owns his own business and pays himself (significantly) better than that. He now has a mortgage so taking a salary cut would be very hard, if not impossible. Finally, being a economist in New Zealand, would probably entail a move to Wellington. And I don't think he's all that keen to move to there; after all, he lives in Christchurch for a reason. At one time XXX worked for ARM in the UK and Texas. He chose to return to NZ. From what I see he is pretty happy with that choice but ... he's not doing what he (thinks he would) love to do.  And, of course, this sets me to thinking. With Pauline away in the UK, I now have far too much time to think. What about my career? What do I  really  want to do?  There is a scene in the movie  Good Will Hunting  where the psychologist asks Will what it is that he wants from life. Will doesn't have a clue; and the psychologist knows it. He tells Will that he can't even answer a  "very simple question" . From this we are supposed to see how weak Will truely is; how fragile his image is; how empty he has allowed his core self to become.   What do you wanna do? [pause] You and your bullshit. You got a bullshit answer for everybody. But I ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a straight answer; ... because you don't know.

      Well, the car is back. However, the front passenger door has been damaged in  the trailing edge corner. I saw this when I inspected the car but it hasn't  been fixed. The front passenger-side mirror is covered in scratches,  presumablby from when the hide the car at night so they could ride in it the  next day. The number of scratches on the passenger-side door has increased  significantly. The steering wheel has been damaged; it now has a nick in it  which wasn't there before. This nick is an imperfection which makes the  whole thing feel  awful. Also, they have re-keyed the car. Now I have a  piece of bare metal as a key instead of a nice chunky Subaru key.  On the positive side ... the car sounds and performs ok; but, I have an  untrained ear so what do I know?  Seems to me that the negatives outweigh the positivies.  _________________________________________________________________ Theres never been a better time to get Xtra JetStream @   http://xtra.co.nz/jetstream

      Guess what, the insurance company wasn't aware that my car had been recovered.  Turns out the investigator had not passed the good news onto the insurance company. No matter, a quick phone call and all that was sorted out. By 13:30, the insurance assessor was appointed. With a bit of luck he will manage to give my car the look over today, failing that, ... tomorrow.  Then I will have some idea of what this is all going to cost and whether it can be repaired or the agreed value paid. I reckon the damage is not too bad, so I guess that the car will be repaired.  Hopefully this will all be over before Pauline flies off to the UK next week.

      Today I met the insurance investigator. He was appointed by my insurace company to investiagte the theft of my car. He seemed like a nice enough bloke and I totally failed to detect any hint of ex-policeman about him.  He recorded everything I said whilst filling in part of the insurance claim. I went to quite some length to emphasize how keen I was to have Archibalds, the main Subaru dealer, do any mechanical work on the vehicle. He said that he would pass this onto the insurance assessor for me. I doubt that they can object, Archibalds have done all mechanical work on the car since I came to Christchurch.  He hadn't been able to look at my car yet bust said he would do so soon.

      "There was no great planning in what we did, the company evolved. You have to follow the river - it's the same now. There is no magic formula, but don't hire MBAs."

       We only do software ...  I strangled the scream that was welling up inside me.  If there is one thing I dislike about generic software jobs it is the attitude that  we only do software . I feel that this attitude fails to accept that software is part of a system, albeit often a crucial one. In my case, the system is an innovative scientific instrument. This is not a piece of software that exists purely in the binary innards of a computer. It reaches out and controls things in the real world: valves, relays, vacuum pumps, etc.  And I think of myself as a systems engineer; not just a programmer who uses a "requirements gathering process" to work out what to do next and how to do it. I feel that my systems knowledge allows me to make informed decisions based on prior experience with other (often quite different) systems. My boss, however, does not want to that. I was told in a recent feedback session, "we do software,  not  hardware". I have a lot of experience writing software at the software-hardware boundary. It has given me a lot of insight into how hardware and software should be co-designed. I enjoy this. He finds this troubling. If I speculate, I think this is because he does not want the responsibility of a software-related hardware design decision going wrong.  So what do I now? How do I keep doing what I feel I am good at if I constantly get feedback, in all its implicit and explicit forms, that says  "we don't like that, please stop doing it" ? Is this another reason for dusting off the CV and looking around?  Or am I just getting overly sensitive to my environment? I have come from a RTOS/Unix/Linux environment into a Windows only environment where the developers know Windows well but other platforms might as well not exist. They can make Visual C++ .NET sing but, once I got into it, so could I; and I still have RTOS/Unix/Linux skills.  So what am I saying?  I am  not  a coder.  I am  not  a developer.  I  am  a  systems software engineer .  Please don't waste my experience by trying to turn me into a coder. I have far more than that to offer and you are wasting my time, and your money, if you do so.

      Well, yet another reason to quit this job and move one. I am getting fed up with being cut off mid-sentence and told that what I am about to say has no bearing on things.  This time it was Clare. I was about to describe my experience of ramping solid state detectors and why you had to do so when she cut me off mid-sentence, telling that what I was about to say wasn't important.  That left me fuming; so much so that I had to get out of the building to blow off some steam.  I guess what infuriated me was the way in which she was perfectly able to discount my experience as being totally irrelevant to the question in hand.  And what was that question about?  Ramping the power to our detector.

      Just back from my holiday to the northern hemisphere. I was visiting family and some friends. I tried visiting my old university supervisor but missed out because he had already left on his vacation. Never mind, I bumped into an old classmate who now teaches there.  Bookwise, I managed to hold back and not go overboard. The new additions to the Milne library are:   Web Design In A Nutshell (2nd Edition)  how to be a complete and utter failure   Tears of the Giraffe, The Kalihari Typing School for Men, The Full Cupboard of Life; I still need to pick up Morality for Beautiful Girls.  How did I feel going back? Especially after all this time?  Well, I felt very relaxed. I had a pretty stress-free holiday. I spent very little and was glad of that. I didn't feel very acquisitional.  What did I notice on going back?  On the negative side, they don't pack your shopping for you in the supermarket unless you ask them; Service in shops, especially shoe shops, is awful. You queue for everything. You have to hang around at the counter to collect your coffee after you oprder your coffee since they don't bring it to your table. And the breadth of choice is incredible; so incredible that the large number of options tires you before you can make a choice.  On the positive side, it was wonderful to see my dad, my sister's family (especially my nephews), Pauline's parents, her sister and her sister's new man, and last, but not least, my godson Blair. Bascially, being able to spend time with family was great fun. Looking back it is so long since I actually spent any decent length of time with family members. I was always on the go - popping up for a brief day-long (if that) visit.  Sometimes it's just great  to be .  Could I go back and live there?  Probably, but not to Watford, or the Scottish Borders, but maybe, just maybe, I could go back to Aberdeen. Pauline tells me that she avoids visiting Aberdeen because she always likes it. I hadn't realised this before. I can see what she means.  Saw a house in our old street going for 227,000 GBP. If we had been able to make renting the house a viable option, we could now be looking at not having a mortgage here at all. Never mind, that road was not open to us when we moved here. Mind you though, it just shows what can happen when you hang around somewhere long enough. Just keep in mind that Watford might be a very special case.
