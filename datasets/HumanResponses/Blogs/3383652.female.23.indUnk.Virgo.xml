       What the heck am I doing?   Was supposed to be doing some substantial work yesterday night.     Task List   1. Pack the books and lecture notes (for the papers I have just       finished - hope I won't have to dig them out again in Aug)  2. Dust the ornaments (Can't even see my M&M and Precious Thots) 3. Remove all papers, notices and messages from my computer screen,      mirror, door and walls)  4. Start thinking about the subjects to take this coming july 5. Take a closer look at all the stuff I have chucked aside earlier 6. Think about how not to waste my June break   GUESS WHAT!!!! I spent the entire night (from 9pm to 12mn) playing games on my mum's 6100.     Who says work should start at 9am    I was all ready to leave for work at 7.50 am this morning until I felt a stirring turbulence in my stomach. I hesitated, thinking whether it is a "cannot wait" thing or just mild disturbance. Cannot wait, indeed. I made a dash for the bathroom and stayed in there till 8.15 am. Damn. I ended late for work. By the time, I took the long stroll to the MRT under the hot sun, pushed and kena pushed by the rushing crowd at Raffles Place (all latecomers), my access card registered my incoming @ 15 minutes past the 9am mark.   Now I know what Yiwen means when she says she need to visit the loo every morning before embarking on her bus journey to work.    PS. In case you are wondering, I am not trying to be disgusting here.

      Can't believe it that I actually flared up at a client's friend. Let's just call him Mr Kay Poh. Was already explaining to my stupid client for close to an hour on the same issues concerning probate. Heard myself saying "as I said earlier"..."as I told you earlier"... "as mentioned a moment ago" (blah blah blah) The things just couldn't get through my client's thick skull.   On top of that, I have this big loud blabbermouth aka Mr Kay Poh who couldn't keep his opinion to himself. I strongly believe that his middle name is  "Interruption".  He interrupted almost every sentence of mine with either "I think", "Why", "Can't he"...   After 50 minutes of torment, I shut him up with  "CAN YOU GIVE ME A BREAK & LET ME FINISH MY SENTENCES"   Complete silence. I then said what I needed to say and kicked them out of the office, all within 10 minutes.     What a thirsty hour.

      Felt like I have a lot to write today....    Movie   Watched "Troy" last night, compliments from the firm. The scenes were magnificent. Kinda of remind me of "LOTR". I was blown away by the structures (though Alex says that it is all just rocks, rocks and rocks). Notwithstanding Achilles and Paris, Hector is the charming dude. Paris is the hateful coward who had the cheek to proclaim it is love, when he jumped into the bed with someone's wife. Saw the giant wooden horse, which reminded me of one of the stories in my pri/sec school chinese textbook. So familiar yet so distant.   When I entered the theatre, it was already dark. For goodness sake, why on earth are the lights showing the seat number so dimly green in Bugis!! What is the point of having lights when you can't even see the tiny wordings!! Felt like a complete idiot until cat (knight in shining armour) came to the rescue. She shouted "Xiang" loudly. Gosh, everyone know my pet name. Come to think of it, luckily the lights are already off and hopefully no one saw my face. Hahahaha...      TV   Went shopping for a TV @ Mustafa (Yiwen's suggestion) after the movie. Saw a pretty neat Philip 21 inch TV, going at $370. Do I really need one? I could be $370 richer, by forgoing this luxury item.       Conversation with Alex (fyi, our conversation was half english and half mandarin. And I have translated the mandarin part into english words for your convenience) :    Only read this part if you are really bored.    Alex : Dear, the American Idol won't help you to choose your TV. You          gonna walk around. (It was 10.35pm on a thur night.)  Me : What? Just a short short while more. I walk around when the        commercial is on.   Alex : Ok. I walk around first.   Me : mm.   (commercial break)   Me : Hey. Where is that guy? (walking around)   Alex : come take a look at this.   Me : I don't like it. The colour not nice.   Alex : Ok lor. You walk around and see lah.   Me : This look cool. Nice colour.   Alex : The price is also very nice. $999 for a 25 inch TV. You can get         a decent 29 inch one.    Me : Oh. Ok. I walk walk and see see first.   (AMI)   Alex : How come you glued to the TV again?   Me : Can't you see meh?   Alex : Sigh  (Alex went MIA for a while till the commercial)   Me : So difficult to pick a TV. Everyone looks almost the same. You       pick one for me lah since you also will be watching it.   Alex : Argh....   Me : Why you so long.. My legs very tired liao. Faster faster.   Me : This one lah. It's cheap and looks cool (while pointing to a 21       inch). Colour should be not bad lah. (part of the reason why i       chose this is becos, the flat screen TV next to it, is showing       AMI. I can just stand there, watching AMI while Alex examine the       proposed TV.)   Alex : Okie then. We take this one.   Me : Good.   Alex : So your room is all ready?  Me : ?????  Alex : The wiring and space.   Me : ?????  Me : Sigh. So troublesome. We buy another day lah.   Alex : Okie lor since you say so.   The end      MRT  Saw 2 conflicting scenes in the train today. One side, an old auntie nearly fainted. Men rushed to help her up and offered her their seats.  Other side, Man fighting for a seat with an auntie (think about the Mother in Ok No Problem). What a sight. The man won becos he is young, agile and fast. Ya, he is young, agile and fast, so why would you resort to fighting for a seat with an auntie! Would you die, standing just a few MRT stops!  Sigh... Mankind (I literally mean  "Man"  is deteriorating.)

      Just wanna share a game site where I frequent for  brainless  games.   Particularly like the one with a man playing guitar and singing to his sweetheart staying on the 2nd floor (i assume). He scores points by catching the roses thrown to him.    urlLink BrainlessGames    Footnotes : Being an IT idiot as usual, I bugged Yiwen on doing this link. To my dismay, she nearly vomitted blood. Frankly, I wouldn't understand the codes she given me... I kept quiet and followed suit, just like an average singaporean.

       Dumb dumb me ... actually deleted all my boss's emails by accident(imagine, 2000 mails in 5 months). Shit. Called for help and was told to restore them 20 by 20. Geeee.. This gonna take up my entire afternoon. Sigh. What's wrong with my hands... clicked on "Yes" when I was thinking of "No".

      While I enjoy reading Peiqing's "online diary", I have never thought of doing one. Till lunch with Yiwen today, she pointed out this  idiot-proof  site to me.    Think i will be trying it out for a while. Afterall, I have nothing to do now. Whatever I plan to do after my exams, I have clean forgotten what they are.

      Yesterday, due to overwhelming workload and excessive preparation cum discussion for bintan trip, I had asked Alex to pick me up after work at 7pm.   Tele-conference with the girls ended at 6.10 pm. I was bashed. Just packed up my bag and left @ 6.20 pm.   Paid my IRAS tax and telephone bills. Just talking about the tax made me feel weird. After all my 23+++ years, I am paying income tax for the 1st time. It's only a mere $41 but it symbolises my sudden growth. I felt that I have grown up. No...no....no.... I refuses to grow up.  I refuses to be treated like a working adult.   So I made up my mind to analyse my IRAS assessment next year. I will go through the handbook from the 1st to the last page. I will try all means to avoid paying taxes again. I am gonna to claim relief for my studies, parents, insurance and whatsoever that I can find.   Coming back to my yesterday early departure, I landed up in one of the boutiques. Tried a couple of skirts. Worried that I would have to pay for the damages done to the skirts because of my ring, I took it off and placed it on the little shelf in the changing room.      Seeing that the size fit, I paid for the purchases and happily left the shop. I was standing at the side of road, waiting for Alex.   Suddenly, I find myself racing to the boutique. Panting, I knocked on the door of the changing room and asked the lady to pls open the door for me.   There I found my ring, still seated comfortably. PHEW!!!

      This is real exciting. My weekend beach break is finally confirmed. Yep, we got the ferries tickets and the resort has been booked. Though there will hardly be any scuba diving like redang, I think it would still be enjoyable.   Afterall, we have the same group of people less Eng Eng & Jennifer. It's a beach resort. We are travelling by boat and bus.   In fact, I do miss the beachy feeling. The sandy white sand with the blue vast sea, this feeling never disappoint me.   Maybe it's a good idea to escape to the beach once a year. It can be somewhere near like Bintan or slightly further away, Phuket or Bali. Of course, budget and time constraints are 2 very big factors.   Never mind, let me just bask in the anticipation of the coming weekend now.

      After 2 satisfying chawanmushi at Sakae Sushi last friday, I was in a DIY mood. Went immediately to Cold Storage to (1) look up the receipe book for chawanmushi (2) gather ingredients.   The ingredients seem simple. Gotten some golden mushroom, mirin, dashi no-moto. This dashi no-moto is the most difficult to find because I had absolutely no idea what it is. So I literally read every single label on every single bottle, packet and can in the Japanese foodstuff corner. I must have been damn unlucky, to find it on the highest shelf at last. There I was, standing on tip-toe like a short monkey, trying to reach the bottle. Wonder where my tall bf is at that time. Then I found out that he was in the queue to buy 4D.   Tried it out on sat night.   It was a failure. The small cup was over-crowded with crabmeat, prawn, golden mushroom, chicken and the egg was too tough. It was hard and lumpy. Not my idea of chawanmushi.   My mum commented that I had too many egg and too little water.   I was so excited at first only to end up in disappointment. Worse, I had to finish 3 cups of chawanmushi and my mother finished the last one, out of pity.    For those who wants to try it out too.    urlLink  chawanmushi receipe

      I m so lucky to have that many people here with me in the office on a sat morning.   For those who are not aware of this, our firm has a roster where every SLA/LA and secretary will have to perform a yearly sat duty ie. to come in office, check computers, printers, photocopiers, mark attendance and handle "Urgent" fax or calls.   After working here for 1 yr and 2 mths, the DAY has finally arrived. Been asking cat, belle  and germaine on what to do today and what is expected of me ...blah blah blah.... I reached the conclusion that it is all very easy work like walking around with 1 eye closed. I was hoping to relax and wait for time to pass.   As usual, I was 15 min late. To my horror, there are already 5 pax in one of the war rooms here at my floor, with more pax to come. What made it worse, was the realisation that my big boss would be coming in too. Damn it. my dream sat morning was dashed.     They laughed loudly and demanded Spinelli coffee. Armed with 30 bucks, I was sent out to buy 4 daily roast, 2 skinny latte and a cuppacino. Help me!!! It's only 10.15 am now.

      While waiting for Alex at Suntec, I went shopping.   Walking past a shop in CitiLink Mall, this particular white top caught my eye. I walked into the shop, searching for it. It comes in 2 other colours, black and pink.   Becos the black one comes in orange bits, so I asked for a new piece. They do not have it there and I was told to come back the next day to collect.   While paying for it, I struggled to make a decision on whether I should take the black colour I like or the pink one. My cousin is having her customary wedding in Jul. Becos I am one of the jie mei and pink top is the uniform.    Was also contemplating to buy in both colours... I must be mad, a single piece already cost me whopping $38.90.   I sticked to my will and paid for the black one.   5 minutes later, I walked back to the shop assistant and asked for the pink one instead. Finally decided to save $$ and get this pink top now, than to shop for another pink one for the wedding.    Now, another decision has to be made. Got to choose between the beige A-line skirt or black pleated skirt?   I hate this. It isn't my wedding, to begin with.

      I feel really bad about it. I indirectly caused a cockroach to be scalded to death.   After scaring me in my boss' room, I transported it to the dustbin in the pantry. Here come along a colleague of mine, who poured the remains of his still scorching hot tom yam instant mee into the dustbin, directly onto it.   It struggled violently and slowly... slowly... ceased all movement. Pronunced dead on 23 July 2003 @ 4.25 pm.

      I m disturbed by the fact that I can't get a chalet for my stupid brother's 21st birthday in september. Notwithstanding that it is a weekend and it so coincides with the 1-week school holidays too.  Tried all means and ways but sadly, there is only the coasta sand resort left. All I can choose now is the venue, either pasir ris or east coast.   This is what happens :   14 June 2004 Entrusted Alex to ballot for the Changi Chalet. He happily called to say that though he didn't manage to get the one with the sea view but a chalet with a fountain view. (Double-storey, 2 bedrooms, kitchen, common area for bbq etc)... Sounds real good and cheap ($150 ++) for 4D/3N. Close relatives aka Yiping, Yiling and Ruiyi were informed. We were so excited at that time...  "oh boy oh boy, we can go sentosa and play for the entire day"    18 June 2004 @ 11.30 am  I got 3 missed calls from him on 18 June within a span of 5 min. Geezz.. must be damn urgent, i thought. All of a sudden, I got a headache which is giving me hell, after returning call to him. For whatever reason, he didn't manage to get the chalet, not even the fountain view.  "Give me any chalet, I dun mind, even if it faces the gate"   18 June 2004 @ 10.15 pm  Surf the net for info on chalets. Checked out coasta sand (abundant availabilty), sentosa, chervons etc... The sentosa holiday chalet caught my eye. Imagine 12 beds in 3 rooms, double-storey, fully airconditioned, kitchen, common area for bbq. At least, it sounds more decent. Of course, it comes in a higher price, $210 per night.    18 June 2004 @ 11 pm  Broke the bad news to my brother and parents that the changi chalet didn't fall through, as planned. But the backup plan would be sentosa. Actually I love the sentosa chalet. It would be really cool when almost every chalet which my brother attend this year would be in coasta sand... and his will be in sentosa. Started to debate whether sentosa is a such a good idea. Questions were raised. So I decided to call the admin office tomorrow to find out more.   19 June 2004 @ 6.50 pm  I must say this.... today is a real busy day for me. So naturally, The intended call slipped my mind.   20 June 2004 @ 11.20 am  ArGhhhhhhh... Sentosa chalets are fully booked.   20 June 2004 @ 1.30 pm  ARRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHH.... Chervons chalets are also fully booked. What;s wrong with these ppl? It is now only June and all the decent chalets in Spore are FULLY BOOKED for that particular week in Sep. Come on, ppl, relaz... spare me one, just one...   21 June 2004 @ 8.20 pm  Reality finally sunk in. Be the ordinary folk and get a coasta sand chalet. In case, you folks are wondering why I insist on making coasta sand my last resort, my stupid bro is gonna invite 50 (min) pax to his "bday party". Last heard, that includes some of his primary school classmates. Can't believe it.. so my dad made this comment : " luckily we moved house and so he didn't keep in contact with his kindergarten classmates"".    22 June 2004 @ 11.30 am  Surf the web again to find out the rates. Damn ex for such a small place. Saw the promotions. It is half of the published price but valid till 30 June 2004. Called them to find out about promotions in Sep.   Old ah beh :"now promotion not out yet, you must call back later".  Me : "when should i call back"?  ah beh : "in late aug lor"  Me : "Hah, i want to book 2nd week of sep leh"  ah beh : "also must wait lor... if you book now, later cannot take promotion price..."  Now I am in a dilemma. Should I be a cheap skate this time and wait for the promotion while risking being beaten to death by my brother or pay double the price and book now while my neighbour at the chalet might have only paid half?

      Here I was, sitting all alone at my table. Not a single soul in sight. (This does not include those in the cubicle, though). It's not that I am hardworking but instead, I consider myself lazy.   In fact, I am waiting for Alex to pick me up for dinner and maybe, a nice and romantic stroll somewhere.  Fat hope!  As usual, he would be sleepy after a full meal and insists on going straight home. Not that he insists, but with his half-closed eyes and barely there response when I talk, I do felt like a devil, posing an obstruction between him and his favoutite bed. Being a good angel, I would of course, release him from this torment by saying that "okay, fine... we will go home".   He would very happily speed all the way while thinking about his bed.    As I was conversing with Peiqing earlier via email, she asked about the outcome of my earlier post, "I m dead meat".   As expected, I got a huge SCOLDING, GRUMBLING & NAGGING from them. Luckily, it was the male client who picked up my call. If it was the fussy & meticulous female whom I speak to, I would really be dead meat by now. She would most probably chew my head off, drink my blood and break my bones. Better not mess around with her.

      I can't help but pity this colleague of mine. During my 1 year and 2 months here, she has changed 3 bosses and now, the current one is leaving soon.   It is not the fact that your boss keep changing that is depressing. It is the tedious administrative work that you have to face, with every new boss. Once again, I hear a/c and admin chasing her to do ALL the file transfer and file closing. Here, we are talking about, hundreds and hundred of files. Sigh... such things are far beyond our control.   Must be the Magnolia fresh milk I had at 8.30 am this morning and  Sunkist orange juice I had at 9.30 am, there is a weird and squishy feeling in my stomach. So uncomfortable.

      Just when I thought I have good news for my clients, this had to happen. After reading the letter from Registry of Births, my world came crashing down.   10 days ago, I reassured my clients that they would be able to register the birth of their newly adopted child in June, before the expiry of the kid's Dependant Pass on 2 July. This was guaranteed and confirmed.   The letter came today, informing me that there are amendments to be made to the Schedule, attached to the Adoption Order. Formal application would have to be taken out for amendments.  Damn . It wasn't even my mistake. This doct was prepared by the court dept and I didn't have a chance to proof-read the doct before filing.   Sob..sob... How am I supposed to answer to clients now? This is such a lousy thing. Who is gonna pay for these extra filing fees? This sucks.

      Phew! What a terror! I did it again!  A minute or two ago, I thot I would have no choice but to abandon this blog. Know why? I FORGOTTEN MY PASSWORD & EVEN USERNAME AGAIN. Yes.. Yes, it is nothing new. I keyed in several variations, hoping to strike jackpot but to no avail.  The worst thing is.... when I sought to recover my username and password, my email address was required. I started to panick again.   As you see, I have a weird habit of opening free email accounts with yahoo, hotmail etc....whenever I join a new group or whatever that needs an email address. My office account is strictly for the priviledged.   Who knows I might use such account for this blog. As usual, I have absolutely no recollection of the password or username for these accounts.    LUCKILY, I did use the correct email account this time.

      Went dinner with Jerry @ Suntec couple of weeks ago. A Spanish restaurant, located at the circle to the Fountain of Wealth. I was told that it used to be "Beavers".   Because it's a wed night, there wasn't many tables occupied, maybe 7 at most. The lighting is comforting and slightly dim. With lesser crowd ie. quieter and warm ambience, it was a very relaxing dinner venue.   The variety is enough to overwhelm me. We looked at the menu, looked at each other and looked at the menu, total loss at what to have.   Sensing our distress, the kind waitress approached us, to make recommendations. Maybe, we still looked stressed after what she said, another guy did the same thing. To give them credit, I must mention that they did recommend the same dishes.    Starters : Toast bread and butter              Seafood soup in a mini pot (clams, mussel,squid, prawn,             onions, scallop with white wine) The taste is surprisingly             sweet and fresh             Escargot... creamy and tasty. The sauce is great with             toasted bread   Main Courses : Seafood Platter that comes with half a cheesey baked                 lobster, huge prawn, salmon, scallop and some green.                 The lobster was the highlight with the melted cheese.                 Makes me drool, just by the thought of it.                   Duck breast and drumstick, with a fruity sauce                 of grapes, plums and peach and some green   Dessert : Same old tiramisu                       Creme Burlee with a scoop of ice-cream... real rich and                 simply divine. I particularly like the brownish sugar            coating             Breakfast Tea (There is the usual variety of tea and coffee)  The entire dinner took us 2 hours. It was pure indulgence. Felt very pampered indeed. I was thinking to myself :" whoever hitched this guy, will be a one lucky woman". Interested parties, pls contact me for more details.                           Rating    Ambience : **** on weekdays  Food : ***** Service : **** Price : Rather pricy (the dinner costs him about $130 w/o wine)  This place is perfect for special occasions. I would definitely like to go again.

      I don't understand these ppl.   There were already 2 ppl standing in the utility room, minding their own business, when I stepped in. Whilst trying my best to remove the gigantic staple from the notes of evidence, another colleague walked in.   She swiftly moved towards the fax machine and started to  kick  the 3 empty boxes in front of it while commenting "Who so stupid to put all these boxes here.. cannot put someone else meh". This created a mess of the already very small and cramped utility room (ask yiwen, if you need a witness to testify the smallness of the utility room).   To make things worse, another colleague says "Ya lor, this kind of ppl bey ta han" (pardon my dialect).   The two then proceeded to walk out of the utility room, leaving me and another colleague there, in shock.   To my colleague :  FOR PETE'S SAKE, CAN'T YOU EVEN PICK UP THE BOXES AND DISPOSE THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE AFTER KICKING IT! IF YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THIS SIMPLE THING, THEN DUN THINK ABOUT KICKING THE BOXES AROUND! THERE IS NO MAID HERE TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS!!!!!   To my another colleague :  DUN TALK WHEN YOU DUN HAVE TO. NOBODY WILL MISS YOUR COMMENTS AT A TIME LIKE THIS.    As a good girl, I picked up the boxes and threw them into the recycle bin.   PS. I wasn't the stupid one who threw the boxes there in the 1st place.

      This is strange.   I went into the lift on 16th floor, and out came someone who I know by face. Exchanged smiles before the lift door close. Went to the library on 22nd floor, grab the SIA Conditions of Contract" and sat down at the side, pretending to read. The moment I sat down, I turned my head to see who was making so much noises.   Argh.... It is that  same  guy. Can't be. I just saw him walk into 16th floor less than 5 minutes ago.... I was sitting so close to the door yet didn't hear or notice anyone walking in.    Eeeeeeeeee..........................creepy.....

      Had a real stupid dream @ 7.10 am this morning, while trying to struggle with the horror that it's time to go to work again.   All I can remember is that the scene started while   I was onboard a bus to school. I suddenly that I forgot to bring my passport so I alighted and went to the opposite route to take bus back home. Apparently, Yiwen, Huiyi and I are going for a short holiday again and we are supposed to leave, right after our lessons.        &nbsp;   So I went home to get my passport and took the same bus again to school. When I reached the same bus stop which I alighted earlier, I remembered again that I forgot to bring my luggage. To make things worse, I haven't even pack it yet. I was supposed to do it last night but I inadvertently fell asleep before anything could be done. So I alighted at the same bus stop and took the same bus at the opposite route home to pack.        &nbsp;   Then I called one of them and say that I am skipping lessons today and will be meeting them at the departure hall directly....     &nbsp; It abruptly ended when my mum was tugging at my blanket at 7.30 am. Shall check whether my dream is trying to tell me something. Mmmm...

      A colleague made this comment when I took a piece of the walnut cake that she was offering. " Aiyo Emily, you are so nice ".... Another colleague was nodding. I guess, she is in favour of this statement. Can't be that the walnut cake was so tasty that she kept nodding.   I went back to my desk and started to ponder.  I AGREE . I think I am a   NICE   person in general, especially when I am in a good mood. Even if I am in a lousy mood, I try my best to stay away from others so that they won't be upset by me accidentally. It's the kind of things that you say when you don't mean it but it just had to come out from your mouth when you are mad.  These words do hurt a lot and made the person upset and me gulity afterthat.   I treat people fairly well. ..... but there is  1 EXCEPTION .   I think that Alex sometimes receives the worst treatment from me. I can get mad at him easily and doesn't normally subside easily either. I order him around. When he fails to do something which I expected, I would be upset with him. I expect surprises from him. I expect calls or messages from him everyday when we don't meet. I expect him to listen to me most of the time. I expect him to have his own opinions and not be so "suan bian" all the times. I expect him to remember things that I have said before. I expect him to remember where we went to on each anniversary, birthday, xmas and valentine's day.  (the list is inexhausive).    I think I am a bad girlfriend most of the times. This cannot go on.   (Must print this blog out&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;in my wallet, so whenever I m gonna lose my temper, I would take a look at it).

      This is not a good monday morning. Let's hope that the rest of my mornings would be far much better.   I&nbsp;was already upset by the realisation that I would have to stand all the way from Yishun to Raffles Place.&nbsp;I was even unhappy when I realise that I have left my book meant for mrt reading on my study table. To worsen situation, my peace was disturbed by the Indian music coming from the 2 girls sitting 1.5 m away from me. It's the kind of loud, irriating&nbsp;Indian music that you&nbsp;see&nbsp;in the TV when 2 Indians are dancing around the coconut tree. I had to bear with that for 30 minutes which seems like hours to me.   I skipped breakfast earlier becos I indulge too long in the shower.&nbsp;My stomach is making all&nbsp;sorts of noises now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops.. hope it is not too loud.   This is not a good Monday morning. Spare me. Why is Friday not here yet????

      WAH... wah .... wah....   Makeup can really do wonders to a woman.   Becos I took a lift from Alex this morning, I got to the office at 8am. Noticed the lights in my floor are on, I was wondering who would be so early like me.   The answer came out of the washroom. ARGHhhhhhh... it's M. She looks so different without her makeup. Something is just not right. I think her eyebrow are missing... and she look so pale and her lips colourless.... It's such a big difference..... I was shocked. Hope it didn't show on my face.   I am now fully convinced of the powers of  m  a  k  e  u  p .

        Settled lunch at the viet cafe with&nbsp;Yiwen earlier. She ordered a homemade ice lemon tea and a pork cutlet vermicelli while I got myself rice with tender beef slices and the plum soda.  &nbsp; Halfway eating, a&nbsp;basket which comprises of 2 fried wanton &amp; 2 vegetable rolls landed on our table. I guess, we were too occupied with eating what's in front of us and our HK trip discussion to bother with it.  &nbsp; Just when the plates in front of us were almost empty, the 2 aunties beside start to think aloud why their basket of wanton and rolls did not arrive.  &nbsp; It then registered to us that oops.... their basket was in front of us &amp; we were not meant to have any basket.  &nbsp; Alas... Yiwen and I had this gulity look while we saw one of the auntie walking towards to the counter to make enquiries about her supposedly "missing" basket.  &nbsp; I whispered to Yiwen what to do. She replied with we can tuck in after their basket arrive. So we continued to sip our beverages while maintaining an indifferent look.  &nbsp; Soon, their basket arrived and we on the other hand, happily tucked into our free wantons &amp; rolls..... Yum Yum  &nbsp;  Bad bad Me &amp; Bad bad Yiwen

      Had lunch with my cousins yesterday. Rui was simply glued to Alex for the whole day. He insisted to hold hands with Alex, insisted to be fed by him, insisted to sit in his car and insisted to disturb him.  &nbsp; My mum asked him :" You like Xiang Yi jie jie (me) or Alex koh koh more"? He actually replied without hesitation, "ALEX KOH KOH".  &nbsp; Hey! Not fair. By family ties, we are closer and I have indeed spent more time with him. No doubt, I can't carry him and swing around like a merry-go-round or touch the ceiling but this doesn't justify why he likes him better than me.&nbsp;I am jealous.  &nbsp; HAHAHAHAaaaahahhaa..

      Had dinner at a korean BBQ restaurant at west coast road last sat with Angeline, Cat, Errol and Eldon. Meant as a birthday gift cum celebration for Cat who turn *** (a woman's age is always secret) this year.   It was pretty crowded and I think there were quite a number of korean families as well. Mmm... the food should be not be bad.   Our seats are special in a way that we sit on the wooden platform (with a cushion). So Angeline and I sat cross-legged. Reminds me of sitting in the hall during the secondary school days. Throughout dinner, Angeline and I were constantly changing our sitting postition, in order to find the most ideal one to ease the numb on our legs. I m turning old and my bones are turning weak. Sitting cross-legged used to be much more comfortable.   The menu is simple. There is a selection of sake, bbq food which consists of mainly beef, pork and chicken and mushroom and some common korean dishes like ginseng chicken soup, kimchi soup etc.   We ordered the pork, chicken and mushroom for bbq and ginseng chicken soup and kimchi soup.  It turned out to be a real eye-opener. There were a total of 10 cold side dishes, all vegetable. We had a seaweed soup, sweet potatoes in syrup (tasty). eggplants (which tasted like bean), kimchi, cabbage salad etc.   Together with the chicken soup and kimchi soup and bbq, our tables were full of plates. Simply spoiled for choice. The chicken soup was pretty good, though according to Angeline, the ginseng taste is too mild. But it's just nice for a novice "bu pin" eater like me. Imagine rice soaked in the  pipping hot ginseng soup, this's good.   Noticed that this korean restaurant is actually very children friendly. There is an indoor playground filled with small plastic balls, a mini bridge and a slide. Outside, there are some tables and chairs for kids to sit and draw. At the entrance, there is a machine for injecting air into balloons. Wonder if all korean restaurants are like this or just this particular one.   Even before we tucked in our meal, Eldon (the hyperactive kid) started to fidget. So Cat took him to the indoor playground. There it goes again. Cat and Errol taking turns to watch over Eldon, having fun at the playground.   While Cat was happily tucking in to the bbq chicken, Errol carried a crying Eldon back to the table. Apparently a kid started to throw the plastic balls around and Eldon followed suit. He got hit at his upper lip. He was traumatised and kept on drinking cold water to ease the pain (i guess). At that time, there is barely a  red  mark. But according to Cat this morning, his lip was swollen and  blue  black. Poor boy.   Angeline and I stuffed ourselves mad. So full that when Errol suggested that we ta pao crabs back to Cat's house for supper, it didn't sound that appealing to me. However, Angeline was rather keen.   So, we had black pepper crabs and chili crabs for midnite supper after the Giant gocery shopping trip. We had in mind, to watch VCD overnight at Cat's house and stuff ourselves (yes, stuffing again) silly with chips and jelly from Giant at IMM. Little did we know that, 15 minutes of gocery shopping = 35 minutes of queuing at the cashier.   We returned to Cat's house at 12 midnight. Had crabs while watching TV. So full that Angeline and I both fell asleep without touching the chips that we queued for 35 minutes.   Bed sweet bed at 3.55 am. Such a long sat night / sun morning.   Ratings :    Ambience : *** (simple family concept)  Food : ***  Service : *** (the korean captain served the people from his hometown first)  Price : *** (costs around $129 for 4 pax with a big bottle of sake)

      There has been a soul "secretly" hovering over the photocopier these few days. She is leaving the firm and bringing with her, lots and lots of copyright-infringed statues, books and precedents.   She is just standing there, all day, making copies.   Shouldn't this be done secretly? I can understand that when one leave a place whom has been her 2nd home for years, she is bound to take some souvenirs with her. But, timing is a very important issue when it comes to taking souvenirs. Maybe late in the night where no one would care whether you zap the entire collection in the library???   This disturb my normal momentum of swinging to the utility room for zapping and back to my desk. Now, I had to stand around there, waiting.    When is this gonna end? WHEN IS SHE LEAVING?

      Found this damn interesting letter in my trash bin.    Date : 12 July 2004  To : ----  We heard that you are going bust and we are so sorry to hear that. For your information, the sons of bitches representing the Plaintiff have decided to seek a court order compelling you to pay them $25K as interim payment. We really feel for you. But knowing that you are going bust and those sons of bitches will not be able to get a single cent from you even if they win eventually, we are of the view that you should just screw them.   However, since we need to put bread and butter on our tables every day for our families, we will also have to screw you and stop doing work until you pay us. So sorry man, but that's what reality is.   Should your company become better and is somehow able to turn the tide, please do not hesitate to contact us.   So long, man take care.    This is so cool. In case you are wondering, I am not the writer.

       My mind is in a complete blank state now.  Not blank as in nothing in it, but more to blank as it contains too many stuff, causing an extremely overcrowded situation and when I tried to think of something, all information start gushing, be it useful or not.   I am attending lectures, almost everyday. Notwithstanding that I have only started class this week, it has definitely affected my sleep, my social circle, my personal time, my bf and my mum.   My sleep is badly affected with my determination to stay up late in the night despite work on the next day.   My social circle is badly affected since I now have no time for my friends.    My personal time is badly affected as I have no time for movies, shopping, fine dining, gym or gatherings.   My bf is badly affected since he is the poor soul who has to pick me up at 10 pm everyday.   My mum is badly affected as I no longer have time for our ocassional makan outings, libraby visits and shopping.   Sounds like I am complaining about my studies. Nah! I chose this myself.    To whoever it may concern,   I am 85% unavailable for these 2 months till early september. Hence, try to ignore me as much as possible. Gatherings & birthday celebrations may be entertained.

      I had to be the messager for this bad news to my colleague ("C")   While waiting for my lunch khaki at 1.10 pm, I picked up a call meant for C. It was her husband. Told him that she is out for lunch.   He called again at 1.20 pm and told him that she would be back at 2pm.   Subsequently at 1.30 pm (oh ya, I am still in office, starving), he called to left a message :    "pls tell C that her brother has passed away".    This simple sentence weighted a lot on me. Oh man, I was thinking, why am I so kay poh to pick her call and be the bad messager!   The moment she came back, I broke the news to her in my gentlest voice.   C look lost yet was relieved. The doctor found out 6 months ago, that her brother had cancer and it's nearly at the final stage. He was completed bed-ridden but his brain was still working well. Once, he even said to them, "you all don't look at me like that". This wsa so sad yet a great relief to his family.   I felt so awful after hearing all these.   Apparently, she lost another of her sister 2 years ago due to cancer too.   After hearing this, I start to reflect on the importance of living a well-balanced healthy life-style and care for my loved ones.   I aspire to be :   1. More caring towards my mum 2. More nice towards Alex 3. More sociable towards my friends  4. More tolerance towards my brother 5. More loving towards Ping, Ling & Rui.    Live everyday as if it is the last day of your life.

      Resolved to travel light this time since it's only a short and near weekend trip.   Even been repeating that to Yiwen so now she is greatly influenced by my idea of travelling light.   To my horrors, when I settled down to pack last night, the few harmless items I gathered on my bed, all seem to have gained weight after putting them in my bag. Together, they are so painstakingly heavy.    List of barang in my bag :   2 sets of clothing (T-shirt & shorts)  Qoo water bottle  Toiletries ie. Shampoo, Conditioner, Shower Foam, Toothbrush, Lotion, Lip Balm, Contact lenses cleanser, Facial Wash, Leave-on conditioner (all in miniatures)  2 sets of undergrament Cap  4 packets of cocoa + marshmallow  Hair brush Contact Lenses Swim suit  Reader's Digest + Magazine   That's all. I dun think it's a lot,.... but why are they killing me with their weight!!!!

      The day started on a lovely note. Received a big bouquet of 24 tulips from Alex. Kinda  SURPRISED  though he did promised that he would get me one on my bday. I had thot that he was merely trying to "fu yan" me. Anyway, I got my flowers and so was rather pleased.  2nd  SURPRISE  came when we were about to leave for breakfast. Damn it. Can't find my wallet. Searched high and low, everywhere in my room, under the bed, in the laundry basket, under the sofa, among my notes and books and everywhere in the car. I was in a panic. Argh.... where is my wallet???? Tried to recall the last time I saw my wallet. Can't exactly pinpoint when... Argh... this is tormenting... I remember paying for the fried toufu at Chomp Chomp... remember putting it on my lap in the car, together with Alex's pouch and the soft toy bone...after that... can't remember.. can't recall... so did I drop it at Chomp Chomp or after I got out of the car at my block??? why is this happening to me today???? We drove back to Chomp Chomp carpark but also cannot find. Alas, this is bad, very bad, the worst thing that can happen to me.... Went home to search my room again... even the rubbish bin near my mailbox.... sigh... dun have mean dun have.... went to make a police report. The policemen were cold and unsympathetic. I thot they had found my wallet when the policeman asked me whether it is a brown leather wallet. Aiyah, he was just making a wild guess.. Lost my NRIC, SIM membership card, Ez-link card, Planet Fitness membership card, medical card, visa card, cash card and various peak cards... and also my cash of $350 ( Shit, my brother had to return $250 to me on sun morning... why can't he just do a simple bank transfer or wait just 1 more day to return to me???) There goes my 1st saving for the graduation tour.      Was upset thru out the whole day. Didn't have the mood to do any constructive work ie. finish my marketing test 1 and HRM assignment.   (Huiyi, not that I didn't want to do but no mood lah.)       Only the Singapore Idol managed to cheer me up becos the contestants are real funny.  To Rocky : Accept it, you are not meant to be Pop Idol ... Opera Idol is more suitable for you. To the Lemon Tree chap : I admire your courage to go on national TV despite being laughed at by your peers. To Steven Lim : I think your performance sucks and you are just out for the few minutes of humilation. To the mousy guy who sound like a mouse : There is no way anyone in their right mind would give u a decent piece of comment when they can't even hear you... Perhaps the only advice is to stay clear from singing contest. To the auntie in brown : Yes, yes, yes.... your brown outfit really makes you look like an auntie....    After a late dinner, I went to the mailbox .....  3RD SURPRISE  awaits me... There I found my wallet lying flat in the mailbox. Everything is intact except of course, my cash....Was pretty  SURPRISED  that my value loaded Ez-link card and cash card are still there... Dunno whether to consider myself lucky or suai....  Last  SURPRISE  came at 11.20 pm. Another secondary school friend of mine is getting married in sep. That makes 1 wedding and 4 rom in the last quarter of 2004. I am the only one of the 2 singles left in my secondary school group. I am gonna be real broke... stupid thief...  I had enough of surprises.... no more pls...

       Been such a short weekend...so fast and I m back in the office, typing this blog.    Friday  : Had steamboat dinner at Lingzhi Vegetarian Restaurant with my mum & Alex. All vegetables lor... there were some sausage lookalike, fishball lookalike, squid lookalike etc.... all taste almost the same. The choice of mushroom ranges from the usual, golden mushroom to the exotic drumstick mushroom.... actually, it dun look like a drumstick or maybe it did look like one before it was sliced into so many pieces.... Each ppl costs around $25 after adding a free-flow herbal tea. I thot the price was okay but my mum and Alex insisted that it was pretty expensive... becos it is all starch and vegetables. Went Carrefour for a walk after dinner. Based on my mum's auntie bargaining skill and the fact that the durian uncle is trying to clear stock, we got 9 boxes of durian instead of the orginally 7. The rest of the fruits like thailand mango and guava are all selling 2 for the price of 1. Our conclusion : To go for cheap fruits at Carrefour after 9.45 pm.       Saturday :  Planned to go to school to do readings for HRM. Been slacking behind behind for 1 topic and if it continues, I would be in dead trouble.... Got myself all ready, stepped outo of the house, came back to take my handphone then got hooked to the TV... There I was glued to the TV for the rest of the day. Watched Kill Bill 2, Shrek 1 and 2, Spider Man 2, all on DVD..     Sunday  : Went to my aunt's house. While my parents were engaged in mahjong, Alex and I were busy entertaining my cousins especially Rui. He was typically climbing all over Alex and me, just like a monkey. While playing ball with Rui, the ball bounced on the desk and broke the table lamp into 2. Watching Alex trying to salvage the lamp, Rui asked him : " Alex Koh Koh, why you make spoilt "? Poor boyfriend, it became his fault entirely...  We left at 5:30pm to go to Esplanade to catch the fireworks. Dropped by Holland V for early dinner. Of all places, Alex had to choose Swensons. Oh pls, if I wanted to go Swensons, I wouldn't need to come all the way to Holland V? Nevertheless, we still settled dinner there. Headed for Esplanade at 6.45 pm. Alas... got stuck in Orchard Road for an entire hour due to the terrible traffic. Luckily managed to get a parking lot at Millenia Walk. Never expected such a large crowd of ppl. There were ppl everywhere.... Wanted to stay at the Marina Square steps to watch the fireworks but Alex insisted that we go to Esplanade itself. Said that it have a better view. Ya right, if there were no tall trees ... it would be a most wonderful view. He kept pushing me to the front, hoping that I would be able to see the fireworks. I can see trees, trees and even more trees... the fireworks were entirely blocked by trees...  Only specks of coloured lights... that's what I get in return for coming all the way here. I was kinda upset and Alex was even sadder than me. Kept on promising to bring me there again next week. Well, I had to reconsider liao.  Went to Chomp Chomp to ta bao supper for my parents and dinner for my brother. My 1st time there after it was refurnished. Actually there isn't such a wide variety of food stall, at least not as many as I had thot. Still rather hard to find a parking lot even it was already 11+ pm. Me being the usual self, brought too much food again. So my poor brother had to finish everything....   (watch out for my next blog - BIG birthday surprise.)

      Oh dear, a simple promise to do lunch with a few colleagues have turned out to be full blown lunch for all the secretaries in my dept. It was initially meant to be a small lunch to celebrate my bday and now, almost everyone is exchanging emails on the venue and date... This is scary... the powers of word-of-mouth  (according to my marketing lecturer).

Dun ask me to do a search when you have already instructed your secretary to do so. 4. Dun ask me to book a meeting rm when you have already instructed your secretary to do so. 5. Dun ask me to use a paper file when I have used an arch file.  You are getting on my nerves and my patience is running very low. Last but not least, I hate your loud laughter......

      It was my first time, at the stadium, celebrating NDP with 59,999 ppl, even though it is not the actual day. It's already good enough.  Went to Northpoint to get the Hang Ten red official NDP T-shirt in the morning. Costs $5 each becos my mum combined forces with another auntie to buy 3 pieces. She purposely got the same design for me and Alex and even wanted to ask my aunt whether she should also buy the same for my 2 cousins. Sigh... Commented I will look ridiculous in this bright red.  While on our way to pick up my cousins, we saw a lot of ppl in red, either on the buses, taxi or waiting for cabs. There were this family of 4 in red top and white bottom... hahahah...  Settled our late lunch at the old airport hawker centre before heading to the stadium. Again, there were red ppl everywhere.... At that time, Alex commented, "come here, then not embarrassed to be so red"... That's true. It would be weird if you are not in red.  Took a long 20 minutes walk to the stadium. Upon arrival, all we saw were ppl, ppl and more ppl. There were booths giving out bread, crackers and drinks. My cousins and I queued up for the face painting. They painted this year NDP logo on their faces and mine was on my arm. It's a spray of fireworks in 5 colours with stars. Quite pretty.  Squeezed into the tiny entrance with so many others. Got me all hot and sweaty. The ushers packed us to the 5th rows from the bottom. Like sardines in the can. While waiting for the program to start, we ransacked the goodies bag. Everything were packed in a red/black sling bag which was rather heavy and bulky.   Goodies in goodies bag : pkt of salted peanuts pkt of Justea green tea (taste weird) bottle of Slimwater bottle of ISport pkt of cheese biscults pkt of chestnuts program booklet NDP magazine discount booklet tatoos (patterns vary from I LOVE SINGAPORE, Singapore flag, 2004 NDP logo) Drum Cap Shaker (sand in a can) Singapore flag Torchlight in the shape of Nokia hp   To the best of my recollection, that's all I could recall. Phews... Luckily, we did not ta bao any McDonalds, as planned.  The show started with 5 mediacorp stars like sharon au, gurmit singh, jean danker etc trying to get everyone into the NDP mood.... they sang and danced to the beat of the music.... Took out our flag, shaker and drum while trying to hold on to the torchlight.... sure is hard for my small hands.  Next came out the "bananas" ...dressed in bright yellow cap, top and bottom, you can't blame me for calling them that. They sure did a good job in motivating the crowd with their actions.  Then it came the usual routine which comprise of march by the SYF award-winning school military band, parachutes, parade, simulated walk-in of the MPs and president, singing of national anthem and 3 major formations by students. Alex kept on saying that every year is the same thing. Little did he know that I was already very overwhelmed by everything. The feeling of watching the annual NDP live compared to watching from the TV was so different and interesting. You get to see the scenes that are missing from the screen. At that time, I strongly felt that I do belong to this nation.... let me re-emphasize,  at that time ....     Funny scenes :   1. The person impersonating the Senior Minister during the simulated walk-in was holding a sign board saying " SM ". We both burst out laughing.... "  sex manic  ".  2. The fake Prime Minister arrived in an old old white car for his simulated walk-in. Alex commented, " Ai yo, preview also must find a good car mah... my year at least they got him a Mercedes" .  3. There was one particular formation whereby everyone would have to dash out from the field to the sides all within 5 seconds. Everyone around me started laughing when a boy, on the plump side could not clear the field fast enough.... he was the only poor soul left running, while holding on the the wings of his costume.  4. Yiping asked me to watch the parachutes very carefully..... when I asked why, she replied :" kan you mei you ren die dao mah ". However, everyone ended on the field on their feet and nothing more. She seemed so disappointed. This is pure evil.  5. In broad daylight, Gurmit Singh wanted us to hold the torchlight in our hand and sway. Hallo... you think this is fun!!! Everyone look like an idiot. Guess he knew himself when he said " I know this is stupid but later. you will all look beautiful ". True enough, when dark prevail, every single of us shine... It was so magically beautiful.  I love the fansinating display of fireworks most. All kinds of  c  o  l  o  u  r  s  and all sorts of designs never fail to dazzle me.  Argh....It all ended with everyone in a joyous mood. just the mere thought of squeezing out with those 59,999 ppl is enough to make me wringe....   NDP 2005 ... wait for me.

      It's a grumpy morning for me. Despite such a cool rainy night, I was waking up, like every hour... not to pee or drink water but to look at the stupid alarm clock. Am I going nuts!!! Now I am all geared up to bite. Everyone, stay CLEAR.
