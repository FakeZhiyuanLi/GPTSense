       Too Much Thyme On My Hands  Last night I was making dinner. I grabbed the marjoram, noticed it had a cover for shaking, and gave it a few shakes over the dish. I grabbed the thyme, gave it a few shakes over the dish, and noticed it did  not  have a cover for shaking. Sometimes I think my spice cupboard is deliberately set up to entrap me. I retrieved what I could and scraped the rest off and threw it away. It was a terrible waste of thyme.

       Sherlock Holmes and the Drug War  A combination conspicuous for its absence. The crimes Sherlock Holmes unravels pertain to theft and murder, motivated by the usual assortment of human passions. Drugs are present neither as a crime themselves, nor as motives for other crimes.  (At least to my recollection, but it's been awhile since I read through all the stories. DOB and I are reading through them at the rate of about one a month, so it will take me awhile before I have a more definitive thought on this.)  To be sure, literature is not criminal statistics, but nothing conveys the mores and social realities of a time better than its literature.  Sherlock Holmes  is meant to be sensational--to tell the tales of the dregs of society. So it ought to be an excellent place to look to see how drugs influenced Victorian England.  Drugs were readily and legally available at the time. Opium dens operated; Holmes himself shoots cocaine from time to time when the casework gets slow. It's not evident from  Sherlock Holmes , but opium and cocaine were commonly used in patent medicines.  And the dangers of drugs were known. Watson lectures Holmes from time to time on his cocaine use, rather as a doctor might today lecture a patient on smoking. In one story, Watson must go to an opium den to retrieve a friend who is tragically addicted, much to the grief of his friends and family.  But drugs still are not perceived as a societal problem per se. Certainly they sometimes cause problems for individuals, but even there the drug of choice for home-destruction is alcohol. (As it has been since Noah planted a vineyard and will be until the cup is passed in the New Jerusalem.) Because drugs are legal, they do not attract the attention of organized crime. Imagine what Professor Moriaty could do if he also headed up a drug cartel.  In short, the record of Victorian England gives us historical precedent that the legalization of drugs not only means no need to prosecute people for having drugs, but also gets rid of crimes committed over drugs--and without an increase in drug abusers. Then today's police, like Sherlock Holmes, could focus on thieves and murderers and let the mere addicts alone.

       New Income Source  The Wall Street Journal had a consumer review of various plain white T-shirts, which apparently are the latest rage. The one that received the poorest quality rating was also one of the most expensive, at over $40. But this was not that odd, considering that the fashion company's stated goal is to create a T-shirt that feels like it's been worn for 12 or 13 years.  Instead of cutting up DOB's remaining premarital T-shirts for rags, I clearly should be selling them. I wonder if armpit holes are now a hot fashion item?

       First Lessons  Last night we were sitting down for family devotions. DOB, noticing he had D1's rapt attention (or seemed to), pointed to the book in his hand and said, "This is a Bible."  I waited, wondering what lesson he would choose for our daughter's first spiritual instruction.  "Don't spit up on it," he continued.  Well, I guess that's a good place to start.

       Gender Conflicts  D1 has a few distinctly boyish outfits, picked up at garage sales before she was born or inherited from her uncles. (They're mostly in the size I expect her to outgrow any second now.) Today she was wearing one of them, a blue onesie with a little bear and fish on the front, when we headed out for a walk. Wanting to keep the sun out of her eyes, I decided to get her hat. It's shocking pink with a bow and lace trim. I think the pink won out.  Of course, that was just to make up for last Saturday, when she was wearing a pink onesie and a Milwaukee Brewers hat. (The kind that nachos come in. DOB discovered it was a perfect fit.)  Let's face it, we need a boy, too, to straighten this out.

       Very Disturbing Thought  In a conversation at church this Sunday, the question of diapering before the invention of plastic came up. A friend related that she had known a very elderly woman who could remember her mother walking around, a baby on one hip, and her skirt constantly stiff and smelly with you-kn0w-what.  Ewwww. Did everybody really do that?  On a more pleasant note, D1 is developing the theory that the small objects that periodically strike her face are subject to volitional control. Firm proof has not yet been established, but experiments are ongoing.  And on a less pleasant note, polyester covers or no, it's time for a change.

       Core Functions of Government  Apparently a WA state legislator wants the state secretary of health to publish pamphlets  urlLink promoting small families . I'm not sure what her definition of "population sustainability" is since families of two or fewer children result in a declining population because they don't fill in for those unable to have children at all. Government moralizing is generally despicable, but this is one case where the moniker "Nanny State" doesn't quite fit.

       The Inevitable Baby Post  Anytime you see a timestamp this late you can bet I'm up with D1. Tonight we were going to Get On Schedule and all go to bed on time. We did. D1 decided she didn't want to go to bed yet. So I'm out with her in exile, trying to get her to settle down while letting DOB get his sleep. Last night D1 went 5 hours straight--giving me the longest chunk of sleep I've had since she was born. But two good nights in a row is probably too much to ask for at this stage.  This afternoon we were over with DOB's family and one of the uncles was holding D1. She was defying all his attempts to get her to look him in the face. Finally as a last defiant gesture she flung her bib up over her face so that she couldn't see him.

       First Amendment Watch   In other news, the First Amendment is threatened, once again, by the people who ought to be most concerned about protecting it. The ABA is considering making part of its  urlLink ethics rules  for judges one that forbids them from joining a group that discriminates against homosexuals. This would mean judges would have to leave groups like the Boy Scouts and, presumably, conservative churches as well.  Now, judges do need--more than any other member of society--to both be and appear impartial. But this can only go so far. Would we ban judges from joining the Sierra Club on the presumption that they then could not judge fairly when large chemical-producing corporations came before them? For that matter, why shouldn't a judge belong to, say, an all-female or ethnic club? (Which apparently would be prohibited even under the current rules.) As long as a group does not call for violence or oppression of another group, simply belonging to a group that has restrictions on membership does not intrinsically call into question one's ability to judge fairly.

       Fourth Amendment Watch  After taking His Majesty (aka my dad) to the airport on Saturday, DOB and I sat in a McDonald's parking lot while I fed D1. At the motel next door the police had pulled over a car, arrested the driver, and proceeded to search and impound the car. We initially parked on the far side of McDonald's, but then a few cars obstructed our view, plus it looked like the situation was well under control, so we drove over to the near side of the parking lot. (Shameless gawkers that we are. We tried to gaze only intermittently, though.) The female passenger was standing against the motel wall, watching with a passive-resistant demeanor, and finally made some calls on her cell phone, presumably for other arrangements. Meanwhile the police took a dog and rubber gloves and dug everything out of the car--pillows, clothes, etc.--and strewed it around the ground.  Studying criminal procedure tends to take the blood out of it. (Law can make any subject boring. One could read the Supreme Court case  Jones v. Clinton  cover to cover without finding anything to appeal to the prurient interest.) Watching the thing live and imagining the same thing happening to me on my next vacation makes the Fourth Amendment a vividly important string of words. Even just a search is a huge infringement on personal freedom. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments aren't just about protecting the rights of criminals (as an occasional law-and-order conservative seems to think)--they're about protecting all of us from the dangers of an overzealous state.

       Keyes to Illinois  So it appears that  urlLink Keyes  is going to run for Senate in Illinois. I initially thought this was a bad idea--Keyes isn't even from Illinois (don't want to go pulling a Hillary) and doesn't exactly have a spectacular record of vote-getting.  But after reading some discussion on it, I'm starting to think maybe it's a good idea. The Republican party needs somebody to run in Illinois, but after all that's happened it's too late for a Republican to seriously expect to beat Obama. The GOP's real goal would be to go down fighting, without wasting the prospects of up-and-coming Illinois politicians. Keyes will run a good race, conduct interesting debates with Obama, and generally keep things moving without hurting his career if he loses.  If DOB had time to post on this his thoughts would no doubt be much more profound, but he's supposed to be finishing up work and coming home. ;-)

       Money to Burn  I am cheap. OK, you all knew that already. Cheapness is neither virtuous nor sinful; it is just a habit of not spending money that may be good (as when it causes me to forgo unnecessary expenditures and remain solvent) or bad (as when it tempts me to avoid paying my own fair share).  Thriftiness, on the other hand, is a virtue. In essence, it is the practice of getting maximum value and enjoyment out of your money. Because bankruptcy is no fun, it requires ensuring that money first goes to paying bills and meeting the necessities of life. Next, it would require some level of preparation for the future, appropriate to one's means and future plans. (DOB runs into people making six figures who can't find money to plan for the future. There's something warped there.) After that, thriftiness just means spending less money on things that aren't important to you, so that you can spend more money on things that are.  Part of this whole equation is realizing that time is money, too. Thus, thriftiness may involve spending less money so that you need to spend less time earning money and can spend more time on things that are more important or more fun. Or it might involve spending less money so that you can have a job you enjoy more that pays less.  Thus, there are few particular behaviors or lifestyles that are necessarily thrifty or not. A thrifty person might live on a farm in the middle of nowhere, accessorized with things scrounged from dumpsters and collapsing barns, or they might live in a downtown apartment and spend a thousand dollars on shoes a month. The issue is whether they are living within their means and spending their money on the things that matter to them.  The trouble is, most people don't stop to think about what's important to them and make sure their money is maximized in that direction. Suppose you spend $5 more on lunch and/or coffee every day than you would spend by making these items yourself. (Ha, Marsha, you knew I'd bring it up, didn't you?) Over the course of a year, that's going to be about $1500. Is the taste and convenience of the purchased lunch or coffee worth that much more to you than the house payments/vacation days/donation to your favorite cause that the money could instead be used for? If so, go eat your lunch in peace. (On the other hand, it takes DOB and me less than 5 minutes to pack up leftovers for his lunch. That makes lunch packing an activity worth about $60 an hour--tax free.)  Everybody has to spend at least some money on food, shelter, and clothing. After that, their priorities are going to differ wildly. There will be things that they'd have to be flat broke to give up (for me, internet service would be one); things they'll spend money on as soon as they have any extra (a bigger house on acreage); things they'd spend money on if they had plenty of extra (attending live performances); and things they wouldn't spend money on if you paid them to (convenience food--beans and rice from scratch are healthier for millionaires, too). The important thing is not what order your secondary priorities are in, but whether you spend in that order.  The only action that defies thriftiness across the board is waste, which is simply putting something that still has some use out of reach of any use. No matter how rich I was, I would turn out lights in empty rooms (or maybe set up a snazzy system of automatic sensors ;-) ). If a wealthy person can afford to buy a new outfit for every day they're alive, that's not necessarily wasteful--as long as they dispose of the old ones in a way that lets someone else make good use of them. Even blatant overspending--buying for $150 something that could easily be purchased for $20, say--is not in itself wasteful. At least the money is going to someone engaged in some sort of productive activity.  Other "thrifty" activities may be thrifty or not, depending on your circumstances. Right now, garage saling is a thrifty activity for me because I live in a neighborhood with lots of garage sales, and I can get a lot of the things I need right now (children's clothes and toys, household furnishings) at them. Before this year I didn't have those factors and I had never shopped at a garage sale. On the other hand, in the past I have driven very decrepit cars because I had my dad and brother to do a fair amount of the work on them. Now I live on the other side of the country, and DOB and I don't have the space or skills to do the work ourselves, so that's no longer a thrifty strategy.  I'm cheap, and I can't help it. I work on being thrifty--which for me usually means being willing to spend money on the things that really do matter to me, and when necessary accepting the tradeoff of spending more money to save time and energy.

      Some people carry the " urlLink fairy-tale wedding " concept a bit too far.  OK, I can picture the bride in wings attended by fairies, but where on earth did they find groomsmen willing to be "frolicking elves"? It's hard enough to get a guy into a tux. Now if they were playing Tolkien elves, armed for an Orc attack, I could imagine it better.  I would thank  urlLink Deontologist , but I bet he just gakked it from Dave Barry.

       How brightly shines the moon  I was finally able to show   urlLink The Taming of the Shrew   to DOB last night. And he enjoyed it as much as I hoped he would. It's such a great story about real love: not namby-pamby niceness, but the desire to see someone become the person they were meant to be, whatever it costs to help them get there. On what it means to be a leader. On the difference between a marriage that's a true team and one where each person maintains their own separate objectives and tries to manipulate the other.  And it's hilarious.

      Can't believe I published without noting the greatest news of all: I can see the living room floor! And sit on the couch! Somehow managed to consolidate more boxes down than I thought I could, then camoflauged the rest with extra quilts. The living room is certainly not quite where I'd like it to be, but I don't have to blush for shame when the mailman comes to the door.

      I wrote a thoughtful and profound post on same-sex marriage on Tuesday, IE locked up, and it is now gone forever, and I haven't had a chance to write it again. If I still have any thoughts on the subject after life and health insurance class next week, I may rewrite them (in Word) and paste them over.  Certified copy of marriage certificate has arrived! Now I can get Ohio licenses and ID in my new name and all that cool stuff. Only it would have been a lot handier if it had come yesterday.  Went on first grand shopping expedition alone yesterday. Got an elusive green garbage can and expandable silverware tray. And a lot of groceries to sustain us through life and health class. Including a frozen turkey, which I put in the sink in hot water and turned it on and left it running and forgot all about it as I went outside for another load, greeted DOB when he arrived home, etc. Came back in and found water running all over the floor, into the remaining boxes we haven't unpacked yet. DOB was very nice about helping clean up the mess, but I can't believe I still do things that stupid. Oh well, if I didn't I might not have anything to write about.  YR convention on far side of the state this weekend, followed by life and health class all week, so this blog is dormant almost as soon as it begins.

       Household ramblings   The garbage disposal has stopped chopping altogether. I don't remember putting anything inappropriate down it. Whatever I did, I'm sorry.  I will never look askance at anyone who doesn't get their thank-you notes out immediately and all to the right people. Right now I would be doing well to find the thank-you notes.  Today I took a walk in the neighborhood for the first time. It's a tidy little neighborhood, with modest brick homes on neatly trimmed lawns. The sky was blue, the clouds were fluffy, the air was crisp and I like living here. Just the thing to rejuvenate me for another attempt at the pile in the living room.

       Random housekeeping observations   I saw DOB off to work for the first time today. (Thus far he's either worked in the home office or I've gone with him.) I couldn't quite shake the feeling of being either a little kid playing house or of acting in a 50's movie (the latter enhanced by his handsome black fedora, "Stewart.")   After the arrival of 26 boxes of wedding gifts and a reception on Saturday, the house is worse than ever, but hopefully this is the high-water mark. I will go break boxes down shortly.  The one advantage to a small house is that I  have  to do the dishes and keep the cleared areas neat, or I cannot eat or sleep. The disadvantage is that I cannot move anywhere without tripping over boxes.  The dryer is sounding again.   Things I have plenty of:  Elegant glass serving dishes Candles Wall decor Bath towels Kitchen towels Small appliances   Things I could sure use more of:  Counter space Cabinet space Floor space Wall space Space space Food

      Don't think  urlLink this guy  will move the Supreme Court, but sounds like a worthy protest anyway, if he can keep things under control. Allowing open carry but not concealed is ludicrous anyway--does anyone really think they'll allow everyone to walk around like John Wayne? Instead they'll just prosecute those who openly carry for breaching the peace or inciting panic. If they're going to ban guns, they should be honest about it, not do it by a morass of conflicting laws.

        In Which We Encounter the Garbage Disposal    Neither DOB or I have had previous experience with garbage disposals, having been raised in composting families. But we think the neighbors might object, even though compost smells better than cigarettes. Thus, we continue battling the contraption.  It backed up for the first time shortly after we arrived after our honeymoon. We called the landlord and were given instructions to use a toilet plunger to unstop it. Fortunately we had been given a toilet plunger as a wedding gift by a thoughtful (even if adolescently-minded) sibling, and had not yet had any trouble with that end of the plumbing. So we unstopped it and went on our merry way.  It backed up again. We plunged it again.  It backed up a third time, right in the middle of cooking a substantial Sunday dinner (potato peels, alas, were too much for it). This time even the plunger could not tame it, especially not once we turned on the dishwasher and it spewed filthy water and chewed up bits of potato peels and not so chewed up bits of things we had sent down several days earlier, not only half-filling the sink with this mixture but shooting it over freshly-washed dishes. DOB having an aversion to dirty potato bits on his clean dishes, we abandoned the dishwasher and both sinks for the evening and used the bathtub for necessary tasks.  Late the next day the plumber finally arrived, took things apart, and disengaged several plum pits from it. Apparently these are not supposed to go down it. Also it wants way more water than either of us have the patience to give it.   Right now we are at a truce. We don't give it plum pits or anything particularly huge or gloopy, and it doesn't do more than spit and wimper and then swallow stuff down. And when I'm in an especially good mood I turn it on while I'm rinsing dishes. Today I narrowly rescued it from having to chew up a dishcloth, so I hope it shows some gratitude.

      OK, brief note on the drama we went to: Click  urlLink here  if you want to read its own promotion.  Basically it provided a version of the gospel that was too thin, and therefore ultimately inadequate. “You might die at any time, so accept Jesus or you’ll go to hell.” It portrayed this particular message effectively in an emotional sense, and I suppose might be effective in getting conversions of a sort among people who enjoy being emotionally moved. Personally I resent it (even when I think the emotion justified), so in that sense perhaps I’m not a competent judge of its effect on such people, but even among them I doubt how long they would stay true to such a “conversion.”  But intellectually the drama left me almost ready to ask the classic anti-God question: “How can a loving God do this to people?” The impression was of ordinary Joes, doing their thing, suddenly discovering that because of an oversight they are condemned to eternal torment. There was little impression that these people deserved what they got. Which, if God is just, must be the case—and if we truly knew our own hearts, we’d know we deserved it ourselves. The real problem was that the law was left out. Punishment without judgment can only be capricious cruelty. There was some attribution of various “sins” that had kept people from accepting Christ (alcohol and partying, mainly), but none that truly reflected God’s law.  Hell was also depicted in a manner that is contrary to the Bible, but commonly presented in cartoons—a sort of concentration camp run by Satan.   What I would like to see now is a drama that really showed the ultimate issues, in a way that made heaven and hell the natural outgrowths of human choices, not the arbitrary imposition of a divine dictator. I can think of two forms. One would be an adaptation of C.S. Lewis’  The Great Divorce , in which souls must choose between clinging to whatever “good” or evil thing is to them more important than accepting the rule of God, or surrendering it and being able to enter into the ultimate reality of heaven. But the landscape of Lewis’ heaven might be too much to stage—it might work as a radio type drama. Although it is not explicit in the Bible, I tend to agree with Lewis’ interpretation that ultimately those souls who go to hell go there because they want to—because in hell they can continue in some sense running their own lives rather than reaching the ultimate joy through submission.  The other would be a courtroom drama in which the accuser of the brethren would be pleading as to why certain souls deserved eternal damnation. (I don’t think Satan runs hell, but he apparently keeps tabs on who deserves to go there.) People could serve as their own counsel, pledging their absence of various overt crimes, or various good deeds. Then the prosecutor could—perhaps via video footage (my siblings and I for some reason believed when small that our entire lives would be replayed verbatim at the gates of heaven—not true as far as I know, but useful for a play)—break apart their pretensions. Show the smoldering hatred that was kept back from murder only by an even more damning pride. Uncover the self-righteousness that poisoned their best deeds. Expose the lust, the covetousness, the bitterness, that poisons the souls of ordinary nice guys (and gals). Except for some defendants, who would have willingly accepted the court appointment of an Advocate, and who would find that all their tapes had been erased.

      Thus far, two churches visited.  Church A: Unfamiliar denomination, further into town, know some of the people through music. Nice service, classically-trained musicians, beautiful old church building. Nebulous doctrine and correspondingly nebulous sermon.  Church B: Semi-familiar denomination, 1 minute drive, didn’t know a soul. Pole barn style of building, service the sort of blend between “traditional” and “contemporary” that occurs when a pastor is trying to change things to the latest trendy church-growth methods without disturbing the old guard too much. Reasonably definite doctrine; sermon was OK but was all part of a prepackaged deal that the church is going through, so don’t know what it’s like when the pastor preaches his own.  We went back for an evening drama (on which more later if I get really inspired). The pastor’s wife seemed surprised to see us and came over to talk, explaining why they did things the way they did things. Some points that came up either in our discussion with her and with each other later on and as I’m writing stuff down right now:  1.	Tradition for the sake of tradition is bad, but change for the sake of change is worse. And worse yet is change in style of worship for the sake of attracting a certain segment of the population. Traditions undoubtedly had some sort of reason for them when they started—it might be good to find it out before discarding it. And a church should never be making changes so it can increase its numbers, or even concerned about them except as a symptom.. Worshipping God and serving people are the appropriate focuses of a church. Any other focus is going to happen to the detriment of the proper focus. (I doubt that this church would claim this was its focus, but it was mentioned numerous times in the sermon and in private conversation.)  2.	There is a big gap between what is inherently evil and what is appropriate and conducive to corporate worship. Big band music is cool, but no matter what lyrics you put to “Boogie Woogie,” it would not be suitable for public worship. Sure, I think one can boogie to the glory of God, but there are lots of activities I can do to the glory of God that I wouldn’t dream of doing in the weekly gathering of believers. So merely saying that “God likes all kinds of music” (repeated several times at the church) is a long way from proving that a particular style of music is going to focus the gathering’s attention directly on God and his attributes.  3.	Both the traditionalists and the contemporists (for lack of better terms) tend to come back to a similar basis: how this or that music and style makes them feel. Which is irrelevant. Worship is not feeling good about God. It is ascribing worth and value to God. And frankly, I don’t see how much worth and value one ascribes to God with the “Jesus is my boyfriend” sort of songs. (A fair amount of hymns don’t talk much about God’s worth and value, either.) Nor does repeating the same phrase over and over a gazillion times seem an appropriate method of worship (warnings about “vain repetitions” come to mind here—it’s hard to keep your brain in gear when you just keep repeating the same thing.)  4.	Categories are not really that helpful. For example, “moving your body is bad” versus “moving your body is good”: if someone finds raising their hands in the air or clapping expresses their worship to God, fine. Hip-dancing with your saxophone during the invitation is a different matter entirely. A good general rule might be that actions drawing attention to one’s self are inappropriate in worship. People should be looking at God, not at you. Another unhelpful category is “hymns” versus “choruses” or “contemporary” or what have you. What makes one something versus the other? The question should be Biblical accuracy, divine focus, and excellence in style. (I cannot believe God is glorified by bad grammar in people who should know better.) ;

      Having been rebuked by our sole reader for a long delay in posting, we attempt to resume.  Being young is seriously overrated. I am starting to suffer from severe generational envy, looking at people whose children are grown, whose careers are established, whose personal items are no longer stored in boxes in the living room, and who actually have some sort of clue what they are doing every day.. The only compensating factors for being young seem to be health, energy, and good looks, and I have never had much of the first two, and whatever I have of the third (DOB: I think she has plenty) doesn’t get the house cleaned up.  Actually, we have at last realized the benefit of having friends in one’s own age bracket, because spending all one’s time with older people makes one feel hopelessly falling apart. We came away much encouraged from a visit Monday night with another young couple. We are not the only ones whose first home was mostly decorated with unpacked boxes! Now if we could only find a church and actually get some friends who did not live an hour away. On the church hunting issue, more later.

      Every once in a while I need to post just to make sure I still remember my username and password.  Yep.  Right now I'm eating and napping for two, and that takes up pretty much all the time there is in the day. But I'm still busy thinking brilliant thoughts when I can. Read Whittaker Chambers last week and am now reading a third person's account of the Hiss case. Fascinating stuff, although I don't think I have the head for details needed for espionage.

      It’s cookie baking weekend. And I am not there.  I could begin by reiterating that the Cookie Bake, in its current form, is not my fault. But that would contradict my general policy of accepting blame when possible, since I am less troubled by guilt than the other females in my family. If it makes them feel better to blame me, I will let them and go on my merry way.  So here is their story: Once upon a time, when Karen was a little girl, her mother wanted to trick her (that is, the mother’s) sister, who was not particularly fond of children, into babysitting. So she asked Karen’s aunt, whose skills at baking were well known, to come and bake cookies with the children. Then she and Karen’s dad sneaked out and went Christmas shopping.  And the next year Karen brightly asked, “When are we having our traditional cookie bake?” Thus it was canonized.  Well, yes, maybe so. I have a fatal habit of getting a single simple and romantic ideal, like feeding a stray cat, and only discovering later that I have opened a restaurant for cats and all other mammals of moderate size. Because in my family ideas never live alone. Other ideas flock after them, spawned by their interaction in the network of our all-too-fertile brains. It’s synergy at its most dangerous.  Somehow that simple afternoon that produced, say, 24 dozen cookies, grew to The Annual Cookies To The Death Marathon Weekend.   It grew gradually, of course. One year we tried one new variety, and it became somebody’s favorite. The next year somebody else saw a cool idea and tried something else. And again it stuck. Naturally if you have a semi-immediate family of fifteen to twenty people, you have fifteen to twenty favorites. And then there are the cookies whose position is so sacred that nobody even bothers to claim them as favorites. Like krumkaka, a traditional Norwegian cookie, which actually gets its own special day separate from The Cookie Bake.   Malinda and Becky both like to Organize Things. So they begin plotting weeks, nay months in advance, as to what we will have this year. Some time ago they began aspiring for a single cookie variety in every potential flavor. Not that flavor alone is sufficient. It also must be artistically decorated, with a reasonable variety of shapes.   To save time during the weekend itself, dough and even some of the cookies are made in advance. Does this simplify the work and get everyone in bed sooner? Of course not—it frees up time for more, and more elaborate, varieties. (I should note here that we have almost never done those flat sugar cookies decorated with frosting. Too simple and too much like what normal people do.)  No doubt they have a new division of labor this year. When I was still there, Malinda organized the program of the day, printed recipes and did the more complex icing. Becky did the most labor-intensive shaping and baking, while I concentrated on the mass produced varieties. Sarah specialized in no-bake or no mix kinds. We switched off mixing dough according to whose specialty in other realms was currently up.   Cookie Bake has its own attendant traditions besides aching backs and feet, of course. There is the curious assortment of eccentric Christmas music Malinda puts on the CD player. (A Goth Noel, anyone?) There are the hasty but very welcome snacks of meat and vegetables provided as a respite from endless gobs of sugar. There are the towering plates of cookies, wrapped in cellophane, to bedazzle the favored friends and relations. And there is the end result, which is a Christmas dinner which is only an excuse to provide enough protein to balance the sugar high.  And sometimes, Christmas cookies lingering until Valentine’s Day. But we try to dump them before that. After all, we’ve got a great idea for a new Valentine’s dessert . . . .

      Now, thoughts on SSM, all the better for having been honed by a lively debate a few weeks back.  I don't think civil government can do much to help marriage along, any more than I believe it can do much to help the free market along. I do believe it can do a great deal to hurt it. It's already done this by no-fault divorce, which has lowered the standard for dissolving a marriage to below that of dissolving an ordinary contract. It can do it again by defining marriage as any group of people who happen to love each other and feel like signing a paper on it. We would undoubtedly be better off if government got out of the marriage business altogether than for it to take this next step.  But I don't think that would be workable. Somehow the state has to have a way to figure out who is responsible for these children that keep popping up inconveniently. It has to have a way to allocate inheritances, charge someone with children's debts, hold someone responsible for their support. This has nothing to do with the state interfering with the business of the family, it's just part of the state doing its job to protect individual rights. I can think of three ways for the state to handle the problem:  a.    Charge only the person who's handy and obviously to blame: the mother. This is simple and avoids prying into details, but it seems distinctly unjust. It took two to tango, after all. Surely there should be some way to hold the other party involved responsible for the direct consequences of his actions.  b.    Leave it all to individual contract and agreement and just have people come and try to prove them in court. This would be the pure libertarian approach, I believe. It sounds nice, but I don't think it would work. If we need a public registry to make sure people don't cheat and lie about land transactions, how much more is it needed to limit people's ability to cheat and lie about something we all know they cheat and lie about all the time? What's a court to do if a woman comes seeking child support against a man she was married to in one church, and the man brings up evidence that she was married to someone else in another church three months earlier? Who is responsible? (It reminds me of a scene in a hilarious old movie where a guy is honestly trying to prove he did not father a girl's child, but then so is the girl--who isn't actually the mother--and somebody else and they wind up with three guys claiming paternity, much to the incredulity of the interested party.) Paternity tests just aren't definite enough to settle these things.  c.    As in the case of land, create a written registry whereby a woman can go and get advance certification that a man will be held responsible as her children's father. Then there's something definite the courts can look to for proof of responsibility. (As a corollary, make it fairly difficult to get those benefits outside the registry, or people won't use it. Again, we do the same thing with land.)  Now, it’s clear that if you look at marriage in this light, there is absolutely no logical reason for extending it to same-sex couples. They have no grounds for concern that babies might incidentally result from their union. If they want to go out and hunt babies up, they can make their own legal arrangements before anything happens. And if we do extend marriage to same-sex couples, we effectively divorce it from any connection with children and property succession. It becomes something the state does to provide people with validation for their personal relationships. Not only is this none of the state’s business, it will actively work against marriage as an institution that protects children’s rights because the personal validation of adults is definitely not necessarily in the best interests of children.  This marriage registry is obviously a long, long ways from the high and holy state of matrimony. That it is indeed up to the church to reinvigorate and restore. (Once it gets the egg off its own face over divorce.) It's going to provide the vast array of social benefits of marriage only in a strong society with character to support it--just as the free market can't exist in a society that doesn't have initiative and honesty. But I think there is a place for the state to keep track of who's who, so that it can charge the right people when something goes wrong.  And I don't think this involves civil government deciding what is good for children, particularly, just dealing with the realities of life in the most logical fashion. As it turns out, marriage is good for children, but that's not why it's important to the state--it is important to the state to order the disorder that children create. (In the end, too, the state is going to have to interfere between parents and children in some degree--when their life is threatened, or liberty is unreasonably trammeled. And the state is going to have to set up rules on what becomes of orphans. There will always be a gray line where the state has to decide what is good for children, which parents must watch vigorously.)  In summary, I don't think you can get the state out of the marriage business entirely without messing up its ability to properly enforce rights and responsibilities. I don't expect the state to make marriage better, but I would like it to stop making things worse by disconnecting it from its one obvious civil purpose. And I also think it's high time the church started preaching by example instead of just by political action.

      According to a prominent financial planner, it is useless to tell people to plan carefully for their children. The reason? They hate their children. However, tell them to plan for the  grandchildren , and the toughest customer becomes a soft sell. After all, grandparents and grandchildren are natural allies--they have a common enemy.  As a soon-to-be parent, I don't find this encouraging.

      All right, I admit, I have a  urlLink problem . I scored about 11 out of a possible 14, which probably means I should check myself in somewhere immediately. DOB scored only 8, which still indicates a serious problem. And no doubt we will become parents of FFS sufferers, and perpetuate the problem to another generation. Tragic.

       Useful Statistic   According to Reader's Digest, 78% of households with an overweight family member experience stress.  This raises two questions:  1. What is wrong with the other 22%?  2. Would someone fat please move in with us to lower our chances of experiencing stress? I don't know any all-thin households that never experience it.

       Favorite smart remarks to responses to pregnancy announcement:   "Are you going to find out what it is?"   "No, we plan to change the diapers blindfolded and allow it to define its own gender."   "Was it planned?"   "Yeah, I had 'get pregnant' down in my daytimer right next to my dinner menus for the next nine months."   "Don't you know what causes that?"    "Oh yes, we know, but we're kind of wondering about you."  (Actually we haven't reached the stage where people ask this yet, but I heard that one from a usually demure mother of soon-to-be 9 who likes to use it on the purposefully childless.)

       Bar Exams I'm Glad I Didn't Take   Despite the accompanying agony, I am glad to have taken two bar exams. It was a challenge, an opportunity to prove myself, a validation of my strength and fortitude--sort of like childbirth, only with longer gestation.  But there are a few I'm glad I missed out on. Like the February 2001 Washington Bar Exam, which I had applied for, but my application was delayed while the Board of Governors considered whether I was qualified to take it. That was the year of the 6.8 earthquake in the middle of the exam. And I understand the earthquake was even more exciting in Seattle than it was in Olympia, where I was trying to stay awake at my desk that day and needed a little excitement.  Then there's this year's California Bar Exam at Pasadena (where I took it back in 2000). Apparently the room where they laptop users were taking the test flooded Thursday morning, preventing them from starting the last essay session until 11:30 a.m.; this meant they had to cancel the afternoon performance test. What this will do to their scores no one knows yet. Poor souls. I had many scary hypotheticals as to what could happen to prevent the bar exam from going on, but somehow floods in Southern CA did not occur to me.

       Shocking Error   Yesterday I went grocery shopping. When I was serving DOB his dinner he looked in horror at one of my purchases. "You brought Heinz ketchup?" he said, "Don't you know that's like giving a donation to John Kerry?"  Alas, I don't usually think about politics in the seasonings aisle. (Difficult though that is to believe.)  But this makes me ponder how unpleasant it must be to be a tycoon. It doesn't matter what one's name was before, or how intrinsically dignified it is, ever afterwards it is associated with ketchup or tires or chocolate bars or whatever it was you got filthy rich selling. Of course, if one's name was something like "Burpee" in the first place, one might as well get rich selling cucumber seeds as not.

      Speaking of people who have a lot of kids (but not too many), congratulations are in order to our good friends the Hastings, who welcomed home their ninth this week. And the older children cleaned the house and prepared a festive dinner of (since it was a girl) pink things.   I'm jealous--I wish I had eight people to clean the house and fix dinner while I go have a baby. But one must start without such advantages.

       Going crazy   Reader's Digest this month had an article on the Andrea Yates case; shed some interesting light on the "homeschool mom who goes crazy from being stuck at home with too many kids" cast that it seemed to have when it was playing in the media. Mrs. Yates had apparently suffered from bipolar disorder since she had been a teenager; it had worsened after her fourth child and she had become suicidal. (Plus the family seemed to have a certain lack of common sense--say deciding after having three children that it would be better to live in a trailer than in a house.)  So no, normal people do not just go off and kill their kids, even if they have a lot of them and stay with them all the time.

      Weird dream pertaining to maternity clothes:  Last week, before going shopping, I dreamed about going shopping for maternity clothes. In my dream I found a very good sale on some attractive denim jackets. This was an excellent deal. It was such a good deal that DOB got excited and started calling all his law school buddies to ask them if we wanted them to pick up jackets for them. Somehow I was unable to explain to him that they probably were not in the market for maternity-sized jackets.   No doubt this reveals some deep psychological attempt to come to terms with my new identity or something.   And I didn't even remember to buy a jacket when I went shopping!

        I'm posting online tests; how cheesy. But I was highly amused by the " urlLink Which Rule of Federal Procedure are you ?" question. (I'm Rule 11, requiring proper investigation of claims before filing; DOB is the easy-going Rule 8(a), whose rule can be summed up, as in the poem I composed while studying these:  "In most states, or in federal court, A statement that is plain and short Of claim to ease the plaintiff's grief Must show that he can get relief."   And then there is the one my  urlLink weird aunt  posted on  urlLink Multiple Intelligences .   The Seven Intelligence Areas   Linguistic: 9 Logical-Mathematical: 9 Spatial: 3 Bodily-Kinesthetic: 6 Musical: 6 Interpersonal: 6 Intrapersonal: 3   A Short Definition of your Highest Score  Linguistic - the ability to use language to describe events, to build trust and rapport, to develop logical arguments and use rhetoric, or to be expressive and metaphoric. Possible vocations that use linguistic intelligence include journalism, administrator, contractor, salesperson, clergy, counselors, lawyers, professor, philosopher, playwright, poet, advertising copywriter and novelist.  Logical-Mathematical - the ability to use numbers to compute and describe, to use mathematical concepts to make conjectures, to apply mathematics in personal daily life, to apply mathematics to data and construct arguments, to be sensitive to the patterns, symmetry, logic, and aesthetics of mathematics, and to solve problems in design and modeling. Possible vocations that use the logical-mathematics intelligence include accountant, bookkeeper, statistician, tradesperson, homemaker, computer programmer, scientist, composer, engineer, inventor, or designer.   Observations:   1. I'm still not as smart, over all, as my weird aunt.   However, I slightly outscore her on logic, which is probably what helps me survive when we debate.  2. The low spatial reasoning score can be testified to by anyone who has watched me park, which was a favorite form of office amusement at my former place of employment. Now it just causes DOB to despair as I can't seem to find the curb without running over it.  3. So homemaker is a prime career choice for us logical/mathematical people. I feel my self-worth growing already. Now I'll go use my logical and mathematical skills to figure out how to make one week's worth of groceries last two extra days and what portions of a wardrobe can be reconfigured to use on someone with ten inches more padding around the waist.

      All right, time to post random thoughts that have been lurking about. Maybe I should resolve to post one thing during breakfast every weekday. (Saturday breakfast is for leisurely conversation; Sunday breakfast is for getting food down ASAP without dumping it on church clothes.)   Clothing  Finally went shopping for maternity clothes on Friday. Not as painful as I thought--found several things that might look kind of good even when I do look like I did with that "three-month pillow" on. Ugh. And did not spend too much.  I was exhibiting my purchases to DOB and he admired a denim jumper I had selected. "Wow, you even found some second-hand stuff," he said in the tone of one commending a frugal wife. Alas, I had to explain that people deliberately try to make new denim look old in these decadent times. I did get it on clearance, though.   Acting  Why should it even be an issue, when people are selecting their "favorites"  with actors whether they attractive or not? It seems rather like selecting one's auto mechanic or doctor for that reason. Shouldn't the issue be whether they can act? Sure it may be nicer to look at a pretty actor than an ugly one, but it's nicer to look at a good-looking auto mechanic, too. (For the record, the only mechanics I've ever dealt with have been family members or old.) That's one advantage of the stage--it requires acting to a much greater degree than film, so you get to watch people selected based on their ability to act.   Random Cool Chesterton Quote   And I dream of the days when work was scrappy, And rare in our pockets the mark of mint, When we were angry and poor and happy, And proud of seeing our name in print.

      So I was trying to rest a few days ago and reading the small-town newspaper from cover to cover because it was handy. There was an insert with an article interviewing various minor celebrities and asking them what their favorite romantic book was. One woman said "Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poems." Fine selection, and better than the drivel everyone else had selected, except then she went on to say, "I don't know whether she ever met the guy or what, but they're just so romantic blah blah blah."   OK, I realize some people slept through that part of English Lit and don't know that Elizabeth Barrett wrote those poems to Robert Browning and they eloped and lived happily ever after. But really, I would think someone with a modicum of interest in the writing might, say, read the flyleaf and find out the back story. Do people have no curiosity anymore? What good is the information age if people have no interest in the information?  Or maybe it's the overload of information itself that destroys all curiosity. I certainly feel more curious about life when I'm cut off from the internet than after an hour of surfing. So time to go develop my curiosity. Maybe with a nice nap.

       Interning  Evergreen Freedom Foundation is planning a more organized  urlLink summer intern program  this year. It sounds like fun. I have to pinch myself to realize that I was an intern there almost a decade ago and, alas, have grown up since then.  There were no classes in my day, but whenever no one could think of something for me to do I would read my way through all the back issues of  The Freeman  and further cement my radically libertarian 16-year-old philosophy.   Oh well, they may have classes but they won't get to live with Lynn, browse her library, eat her meals, and listen to  Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates  at night.  Next best thing to being an intern would be teaching the interns, but I'm too far away for that, either. One of the greatest joys of life is the joy of indoctrination. However, by that time this summer I should be starting in on a much longer and more intense indoctrination of my own personal student. What's six weeks compared to a lifetime?

       Political Stuff   Kerry has  urlLink alleged  that high gas prices are the fault of Bush catering to oil interests. C'mon folks, I know you think Bush is dumb, but even he's not dumb enough to manipulate higher prices in an election year. Kerry's solution, meanwhile, is to stop stockpiling oil. Yeah, if we stop saving money, we'll have more to spend!  And at last a  urlLink study  shows that public funding of baseball stadiums isn't necessary for them to be profitable. Not that this makes a difference into whether they should be publicly funded--if they weren't profitable, it would indicate too little interest to justify building them. But free market baseball fans should be happy to learn this will not be necessary.  Interestingly, the opposing viewpoint only argued that teams would make less in profits if they had to pay for the stadium themselves than if the public did--and thus teams in private stadiums would get less back than teams in public stadiums. Obviously. But government isn't supposed to be in the business of removing risk and maximizing profits for private businesses.

       A Tragic Day   Ireland has  urlLink banned smoking  in pubs.  Now, understand, I don't drink. I don't smoke. Since the baby, I'm fairly sensitive even to second-hand smoke. I've only been in a pub twice in my life (once in one frequented by Lewis and Tolkien, once in one frequented by Chesterton), and then all I had was lunch. But there has always been a small corner of my soul happy in the image of men in tweed caps smoking and drinking and singing folk songs and plotting political revolutions. I fear if one takes out one piece of the arch, the whole arch may fall. If you smoke with your drink, then you will take your drinks home with you, and then where will the folk songs and revolutions go?  If only Chesterton were here to celebrate the camaraderie of the public which is the purpose of a public house. Let the Irish have their pubs as the Baptists have their potlucks, though neither are very good for our health, because people must and should gather together. Smoking is not improved by driving it out of human fellowship any more than drinking is, as Chesterton did have occasion to write about:   God made the wicked Grocer  For a mystery and a sign, That men might shun the awful shops And go to inns to dine; Where the bacon's on the rafter And the wine is in the wood, And God that made good laughter Has seen that they are good.  . . . .  The wicked Grocer groces In spirits and in wine Not frankly and in fellowship As men in inns do dine; But packed with soap and sardines And carried off by grooms, For to be snatched by Duchesses And drunk in dressing rooms.

       More on Easter Eggs   Posting about Easter eggs has given me cause to ponder the appropriateness of various traditions. I have encountered various Christian arguments or prejudices against such traditions as decorating Easter eggs, hanging up holly and evergreens for Christmas, etc., because they are associated with this or that pagan holiday.   I have no reason to doubt the historicity of their claims. But I do doubt that they follow. After all, pagan does not necessarily mean demonic. A lot of things pagans did simply because they were the natural, human thing to do. It's natural to hang up holly and evergreens inside in the winter, because there's nothing else outside to decorate with. (I don't see anyone banning flower arrangements, but no doubt flowers are associated with evil pagan rites, too.) It's natural to use eggs in a spring holiday, because anybody with chickens has a lot of eggs in the spring. And why not decorate them, when they have that cool blank canvas of a shell just waiting to be decorated?   I can see this being in the meat-offered-to-idols category, where if someone was lured back into some pagan observance by their Christian friends doing something similar it would be a problem, but I really can't see anyone in modern America being drawn back into worshipping the fertility goddess by dyeing eggs. The association just isn't there any more. (They're much more likely to be drawn into it by researching healthy living, relaxation and natural childbirth, but that doesn't mean those things are wrong, either--just that we always have to watch our step.)   This of course is utterly separate and distinct from the question of whether one's traditions associated with a particular religious holiday reinforce pondering the true significance of the holiday, merely add to the festivity and anticipation, or become a distracting encumbrance. That's a judgment call that can only be answered by the people participating.

       Easter Eggs   DOB and a fellow rep were meeting with one of their clients last week, an older fellow whose financial concerns (and stories) have taken up a good bit of their time over the last several months.  As they settled down to the newest round of paperwork, Mr. Client said, "Now you guys have been a great help to me with your brains over the past several months. Today I'll need your help with your hands. We've agreed to provide 32 dozen dyed Easter eggs for church, and we've only been able to get 12 dozen done. So after you're finished with this stuff, I'll need you to come out back and dye the rest."  DOB and fellow rep glanced at each other, trying to figure out how to say no without antagonizing the client. Finally Mr. Client cracked up and said he was only joking. Still, I wouldn't put it past him.

       Brain Freeze   I had a scheduled phone call today in which I was supposed to give a final answer on whether I was interested in buying a nutritional product, and I wanted to give the ingredient list one more look before saying, "No." (Sounds good in theory, but contains stuff DOB isn't supposed to have.) But I couldn't remember the name of the product.  Now, understand, I've spent several hours on the phone with people praising this product over the past months. I had literature on it, somewhere. I had looked it up on the web before, but longer ago than my history folder. Rack my brain as I could, I could not remember it.   And then, quite suddenly, I remembered that my brothers had casually mentioned once that they had spoofed the product in a camp skit. And I knew what it was.

       Born Expensive  Last night we attended our first birthing class. For non-parents among our readers, birthing classes are places where people go and discuss things not normally discussed in polite conversation, which based on my experience with little kids, is excellent preparation for parenthood.  Since it's a forty-minute drive away (the hospital has classes right down the street, but we wanted the  urlLink Bradley method ), and gets out rather late, the teacher has kindly offered to let us come early and watch the video that everyone else will watch at the end of class. Not only does this get us home sooner, but if it gets really gross we can close our eyes without appearing uncooperative. I'm not sure if that will help during birth or not.  The classes were held at a chiropractic office, and one of the chiropractor's wife was there with their four-month-old baby, which she brought out and exhibited for us so we would know what we were working on. We were all duly impressed.  We forgot to put money in the account, so we haven't paid for the class yet. When Rousseau said man was born free, he didn't know what he was talking about.

       How to Look Like an Idiot and Make Everyone Hate You   Yesterday I was heading to my prenatal visit, driving merrily down the road, when I got into the right turn lane. Only after I had come to a complete stop did I realize that the car in front of me had no occupant and that I was, in fact, parked. At that moment traffic in the lane next to me suddenly filled up with large, evil semis. And unfortunately I was pulled up too far to just swing back out into traffic. So I had to back up, which always confuses me because I forget which gear I am in, while more or less patient people offered me the chance to get back into traffic and then gave up on me.   It should be a no-parking zone. Maybe it is, in which case, I hope they got a ticket.  Can't loiter too long today--sister-in-law is coming over to help clean out the nursery.

       Consumer Protection   Anti-trust laws for some reason make it impossible for us to have our DSL line provided by the phone company, even though it runs over the phone lines. So when we have problems with our DSL line, it is unclear (to us and to them) who should solve the problem. I'm not sure what this is meant to protect consumers from, maybe from having spare time on the weekends.  BECAUSE, last Saturday the DSL line was down. So DOB got on the phone with one company, who told him to call the other company. He called the other company and was just being referred back to the first company when the DSL spontaneously started working again. We went on our merry way for awhile and it stopped again. He called them again and they started researching it. Several more phone calls back and forth, several blinks on and off, and a three-hour-late lunch, and they finally scheduled a technician to come visit us Monday morning.  Then it started working again and worked fine the rest of the weekend. So Monday morning I called them and said not to bother. This entailed multiple people from both companies calling us later in the day to confirm that everything was, indeed, fine.   Today it blinked out again. Grrrrrrr.

       More Random Comments   Hardly anyone blogs on the weekends. For east coasters, Monday morning is a bleak blog-checking time.  No matter how complimentary the relevant adjective, never use the adverb "enormously" in describing your pregnant wife.  I've been reading a site called " urlLink Ladies Against Feminism ." Mostly good stuff, aside from an occasional pro-antebellum South statement that raises my hackles. (It's got stuff from a variety of sources, though, so I don't know that that represents the opinions of the editors.) The  urlLink article  on feminism in communist countries was particularly interesting--why did countries opposed to every other (true) right make such a fuss about providing "women's rights?" For real entertainment, read the (expurgated) "Scorching Commentary." "Bible thumping fishwives?" As Dave Barry would say, that would make a great name for a rock band . . .   Last night there was a forum on Creation at our church, with presentations by various men in the church, including a fine one by DOB's dad. One question that was raised still has me pondering--a woman asked how a spirit could create all the material world. I guess we tend to think of "spirit" as a weak shadow of "reality," no matter how hard we try, and the tangible as the most real. But then someone referred to DNA, and I realized that it is always the intangible that makes the tangible. What, for instance, is transforming biscuits and eggs into baby as I type? It is that mysterious code of DNA that somehow has ordered a single cell to divide and diversify according to a written plan. The flesh profiteth nothing. It is the Spirit--the Word--that giveth life.

      Justice Scalia is, of course,  urlLink brilliant  even when forced to argue in his own defense. His opinion is a masterful example of explaining one's actions without being defensive--indeed, he graciously attacks back. If Supreme Court justices can no longer have a nodding acquaintance with members of the administration, we will indeed have a hard time operating a Supreme Court.

      My weird aunt will be particularly interested to know you can now view  urlLink Shakespeare's will  online. But the legibility is not particularly high. It puts me in mind of Mark Twain in  The Innocents Abroad :  "Ah--Ferguson--what--what did you say was the name of the party who wrote this?"  "Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!"  Another deliberate examination.  "Ah--did he write it himself, or--or how?"  "He write it himself!--Christopher Colombo! he's own handwriting, write by himself!"  Then the doctor laid the document down and said:  "Why I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could write better than that."  "But zis is ze great Christo---"  "I don't care who it is! It's the worst writing I ever saw. No you mustn't think you can impose on us because we are strangers. We are not fools, by a good deal. If you have got any specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out!--and if you haven't, drive on!"

      Yesterday was St. Patrick's day, and I didn't fix corned beef and cabbage. I didn't make green cake or even green jello. And I didn't watch  The Quiet Man , which is what my family always watched on St. Patrick's day once we outgrew  Darby O'Gill and the Little People .   We watched  Father's Little Dividend  instead, mostly because we have it and we are trying to watch all the DVD's we want to before the DVD player gets turned into the office assistant's computer and goes in to the office. We are now very grateful for non-meddling parents and marital harmony.  Another movie we watched this past week was called  Son of Monte Cristo . We weren't expecting that much from it, just a corny black-and-white action movie. It turned out to be great: compelling villain, almost believable hero, good political plot, well-drawn minor characters, and suspense that built until the last minute of the movie. Three thumbs up! (Baby liked it, too.)

      First segment of thank you cards written, putting us at 108 out of about 190. Don't get too impatient, though, they still have to be signed, licked, stamped, and mailed.  And the longest extension I can find from an etiquette site is 3 months.  Rats. However, they do say better late than never. And I am not yet as late as the latest wedding thank-you I have ever received. I just have this nagging suspicion that half the people from my half of the list are going to open their cards and say, "Do we know these people?"  Today starts the third trimester of being pregnant. Which raises new questions and challenges, like "How do I tie my shoes?" Good thing I can put my boots away in a few more weeks.

       Clarification   I did  not  ask her to shovel the driveway (or the car). I was preparing to leave for an appointment and looked out the window and there she was. Having never dealt with snow shovels before, she didn't realize that a shovel-full of the white stuff can be as heavy as a couple gallons of water (this measurement taken from the basic ingredients of snow). Better done by a grown man than an expectant mother.  Wait... I'm a grown man?! Ack...

       Random observations:   An actual snowfall is not as bad as snow threatening. But I still wish it would melt.  I need lessons in snow shovelling. Some things I learned: Bend at the knees. Don't use a shovel on the car. It's heavier than it feels  The secret to hot cereal is not overcooking it. The secret to not overcooking it is remembering that it is in there while simultaneously ironing DOB's clothes. The secret to remembering it is to have a brain, which I never locate until mid-morning.  I'm pleased to report that even though I am now happily married, I still despise it as much as ever when people gush about their love life. So my disgust wasn't motivated by envy, anyway, but true Nordic dislike of public gushiness. (Then again, maybe now I envy those who still have time and energy to gush. Ha, just wait until you have kids!)  Speaking of having kids, I'm speculating on whether people really, really wanting kids is as bad for the kids as not being wanted. Imagine being a poor newborn baby, suddenly faced with fulfilling someone's huge expectations for you to fulfill their emotional needs or redo their life for them. You wouldn't know what hit you. And you couldn't possibly measure up, resulting in constant frustration on both ends. The best reason to have kids is as the accidental byproduct of being happily married. (Under which circumstances, as DOB points out, the chances are pretty good.)   So I wonder what the psychological effect is of a society in which it is standard procedure to wait to have children until you are desperate. It really can't be good for a child to have their parents buying them lesson cd's to improve their mind prenatally. Relax, Baby, we're happy to have you along for the ride, but we don't need you to fix the car or anything.

       Anchors Aweigh   Last night we attended a political event at a place billed as the "Yacht Club Clubhouse." The title seemed a tad redundant, but I was curious to see what yacht clubs looked like in the midwest.  After all, though I had never been into boating myself, I had certainly attended events at yacht clubs and knew what they were like: large, bare buildings with a basic kitchen and bathroom and a big empty room where presumably the members meet and fight over the cost of repairing the marina. Outside would be a long marina and a whole lot of boats.  As we drove up, I noted the building was rather small. Also it seemed to be on a bit of a hill. Inside, it was quite the most elegantly furnished "yacht club" I had ever seen, with nautically-themed decor and cream-colored leather sofas. However, hard as I peered through the gathering darkness outside I could see no sign of actual boats. Or, for that matter, water, except for a small pond and a half-empty swimming pool.  Maybe they run remote-controlled yacht races in the swimming pool.

       Marital Strength Test   Yes, DOB and QOC have survived the ultimate test to the strength of their marriage. It's not balancing the checkbook or even remodelling.  The ultimate test is whether you can jointly sort through boxes of old stuff and decide what to throw away and what to keep.  This is because the balance of nature is so arranged that a person who treasures the ball maze game Mrs. Feeblemeister gave them for reciting Psalm 1 in Sunday School in 1985 invariably marries someone who would throw away the crown jewels if they took too long to dust. And few issues so resonate with the deepest core values of a person as what they think is worth keeping around.  Not that I can't appreciate the value of having a saver around. For instance, DOB still has five boxes of toys left from childhood, many of which our own children will be allowed to enjoy. (One box has been designated Daddy's Toys and cannot be touched without careful supervision.) I have half-a-dozen stuffed animals, everything else having passed into the communal stock at my family's house, where it was destroyed by succeeding generations of siblings, guests, and grandchildren.   Still, it is a challenge to learn the proper reverence with which one should approach the heirlooms of childhood. I knew my approach was still wrong when I found myself asking if the mud on the truck tires was heirloom mud or I could wash it off . . .   Regardless, we got twelve boxes sorted and moved up to the attic. Now comes the really hard part: sorting old files and schoolwork. But I have a crib offer, so something's got to go in there.

       Doctor's Orders   The case of the woman  urlLink charged with murder  for refusing a C-section first freaked me out; then it didn't sound so bad; then I thought about it more and decided it was still freaky.  Certainly her decision sounds unwise and even cruel. I would agree that she was wrong. But what makes it murder? She didn't  do  anything except allow nature to take its course. Arguably, she had a duty to act since the babies were dependent on her, but at worst, that should be involuntary manslaughter.   What worries me is how this could be applied. What if I was recommended to take a C-section as the best option for my baby, but we decided the benefits didn't outweigh the risks to me and the baby? (C-sections by no means guarantee a better outcome than vaginal birth, except in a few rare circumstances.) What if I refuse some other form of medical intervention and then something goes wrong?   The stories all contain a quote that they could find no motive other than cosmetic for the mother to act as she did. But motive is irrelevant to a murder charge; it just helps justify it in public. What if the prosecutor considered my concerns insubstantial? For example, if the C-section was not clearly necessary, I could well be influenced by the reality that getting insurance coverage for vaginal birth after cesarean is very difficult, and the desire to avoid complications in future pregnancies and deliveries. Is that insufficient reason to buck the doctor?  Or we have decided to have only a minimal number of tests, avoiding ultrasound and the like. What if it later turns out that the baby has a problem that could have been averted/proactively treated had we had more tests? Could we be liable for that?  I don't think we want a world where parents have a legal duty to follow doctor's orders. Doctors aren't any more infallible than parents. And the old saying bears repeating: Hard cases make bad law.

       Brilliant Wives and the Men Who Disagree With Them   Re-taking the test in mind of my views 5 years ago, when I was young and unexperienced, scored me a 44. Hmm. QOC has certainly enhanced my ability to defend "statist" views in libertarian company. Note that the yes/no question reads "Is  all  government inherently evil?" Of course it isn't. Civil government was ordained by God to defend us against evil. Crooked politicians are evil.  Sidenote: why are bloggers so stupid? Last night I saw one of the recently-made blogs on blogger.com, the title of which was an eloquent "moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo". Time was, one had to have something intelligent to say and be able to express it in detail and with logic in order to be heard. Then radio gave a national ear to anyone who sounded good. Then TV gave a national eye to anyone who looked good. Then the internet gave a voice to everyone on the planet. What's worse, good-looking morons or bad-looking morons?   At least QOC, who could do well on TV or radio, could still do well in the old newspaper realm, too.

       Ideological Purity and Clean Dishes   In the interest of maintaining order at the in-law's house while the parents-in-law are out of town for the weekend, we have taken next-to-youngest brother-in-law in for a few days. (They're all good kids, but four unsupervised boys between 11 and 17 are a dangerous combination no matter what their behavior.) He is doing all my housework for me so I can write thank you notes. I can't wait to have teenagers.   I also took a test of the purity of one's  urlLink libertarian leanings , which is the best libertarian test I've seen so far. I came out with 75 points, which makes me a medium-core libertarian. I will get DOB to take it and see how he scores--he probably scores a bit lower, but higher than he would have a few years ago, while my score has probably come down. You see how we are corrupting each other. I even paused before answering the question "Is government inherently evil?" as "Yes." (I did mark it as a necessary evil.) I need to go read  Justice Without the State  and reinvigorate myself. Everyone repeat after me: "Government is eeeevvviiiillll."

       New Posting  Wherein I, the affectionately-named "DOB," try to post something on this blog. I don't really have anything profound to say, it just seemed like a cool thing to try for once. The things currently pressing on my mind, as a result of this evening's leisure reading, would require too much explanation: particularly the Wall Street Journal article defending Novak in the matter of the CIA agent expose. Or the fact that the new Porsche GT3 can beat out a Ferrari that's twice the price. One day, hopefully, I'll have money for a Porsche like that... heh, and then I'll spend it on something worthwhile, like down-payment on a farm.  Okay, that's a lot of nothing. I'll go back to reading the more interesting posts on this blog ~

       urlLink Andree Seu  offers a good point: the push for bigamy is perfectly logical next since the needs of a bisexual aren't met by being married to one person of either gender. The only thing to stand in its way would be the reality that gay marriage alone will probably be enough to reduce marriage to irrelevance.  On a lighter note, another Chesterton quote I had to post:  "The woman has a fixed and very well founded idea that if she does not insist on good manners nobody else will. Babies are not always strong on the point of dignity, and grown-up men are quite unpresentable."  Yup. This means you, DOB. ;-)

       Tales Out of School     Options for Eating   Yesterday's copy of the local paper (the kind that reports on the table decor at the ladies' club luncheon) contained a story on the district's school breakfast program. They are quite pleased with the response, finding that not only are many students participating at free or reduced cost, but many are paying full price--in other words, their parents certainly could afford to feed them breakfast, they just don't want to bother. Full price is a dollar, which seems cheap compared to breakfast at a restaurant, but would be pretty extravagant for breakfast at home.  And such healthy food as they are getting, carefully designed to meet state nutrition standards: an enriched doughnut, cold cereal such as Trix, or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on graham crackers.   My mom wouldn't have let me eat that much sugar for dessert, let alone breakfast.    Options for Thinking   Secularists are gasping with horror at the new lesson plan being offered by the Ohio School Board. Not that it mentions God or creation or anything. It's not even mandated. But teachers would have the option of including a  urlLink lesson  that would allow for critical thinking about evolution.   Can this be constitutional? Surely the Constitution mandates that evolution be taught as unquestionable fact. Considering that Charles Darwin wasn't born when the Constitution was written, I kind of doubt it.  The insidious things students will be taught through this  urlLink lesson :  * Understanding the nature of theories * Applying the scientific method * Distinguishing between microevolution (change within species) and macroevolution (change between species) * Arguing whether different evidence supports macroevolution or not.  Now, what is so scary about this? Is the theory of evolution so weak that it can't handle a classroom of 16-year-olds thinking critically about it?   The secularists will compare teaching--or even hinting--about intelligent design to giving students the option of considering the flat earth theory. But come to think of it, debating the curvature of the earth, examining the evidence for and against it and allowing students to argue both sides, would be an excellent intellectual exercise. And I'm pretty sure students would come to the conclusion that the earth was, in fact, round.  So what are they so afraid of here?

       Churchill  I just finished the first book of Churchill's history of World War II, which culminates with his rise to Prime Minister as Holland and Belgium are invaded by Germany. You have to love his well-deserved self-confidence, with only a hint of irritation at the stupidity of the rest of the world for not confiding in him more:  "Thus, by the afternoon, I became aware that I might well be called upon to take the lead. The prospect neither excited nor alarmed me. I thought it would be by far the best plan."  "Thus, then, on the night of the tenth of May, at the outset of this mighty battle, I acquired the chief power in the State, which henceforth I wielded in ever-growing measure for five years and three months of world war, at the end of which time, all our enemies having surrendered unconditionally or being about to do so, I was immediately dismissed by the British electorate from all further conduct of their affairs. . . . I cannot conceal from the reader of this truthful account that as I went to bed at about 3 a.m. I was conscious of a profound sense of relief. At last I had the authority to give directions over the whole scene. . . . My warnings over the last six years had been so numerous, so detailed, and were now so terribly vindicated, that no one could gainsay me. I could not be reproached either for making the war or with want of preparation for it. I thought I knew a good deal about it all, and I was sure I should not fail. Therefore, although impatient for the morning, I slept soundly and had no need for cheering dreams. Facts are better than dreams."  There is the voice of a craftsman who knows his job well and is glad for the chance to do it. It just happens that his job is saving civilization.

       Dying Brain Cells  While surfing around this morning I found the  urlLink blog  of a former fellow-student at journalism courses in summer '02. A year and a half ago I at least thought I could hold my own in intellectual debate with him, and now he writes about profound philosophical issues while I write about thank-you notes.   I had heard motherhood killed brain cells--I didn't realize it started so soon. You lose your body, you lose your mind, you lose your ability to make plans more than five minutes out. I used to think it odd that such a serious undertaking as bringing another human being into the world was not predicated by a solemn and unpleasant activity that would prove one's commitment to the task. On second thought, if it was, I'm not sure the world population would ever have reached the replacement rate.  Enough depressing thoughts. The problem is not a loss of brainpower, but a necessary diffusion of it. If I cannot be the student of philosophy I was two years ago, it is because I must also keep a house operating, cook healthy food for three very hungry people, run an office, train for a major athletic event, prepare to introduce a new person to the world, and still have the energy to make it all look like fun. It is more important, after all, to live great ideas than just to think them.  Time for another Chesterton quote: "If drudgery only means dreadfully hard work, I admit the woman drudges in the home, as a man might drudge at the Cathedral of Amiens or drudge behind a gun at Trafalgar. But if it means that the hard work is more heavy because it is trifling, colourless and of small import to the soul, then, as I say, I give it up; I do not know what the words mean. To be Queen Elizabeth within a definite area, deciding sales, banquets, labours and holidays; to be Whitley within a certain area, providing toys, boots, sheets, cakes and books; to be Aristotle within a certain area, teaching morals, manners, theology, and hygiene; I can understand how this might exhaust the mind, but I cannot imagine how it could narrow it. How can it be a large career to tell other people's children about the Rule of Three, and a small career to tell one's own children about the universe? How can it be broad to be the same thing to everyone, and narrow to be everything to someone? No; a woman's function is laborious, but because it is gigantic, not because it is minute. I will pity Mrs. Jones for the hugeness of her task; I will never pity her for its smallness."  There, I feel better now. Back to the dishes.

       Gasp   I was so proud of myself for finally sitting down and writing thank you notes--and only six months out, too! But I got stumped on how to write a thank you note for the sixth set of non-matching bath towels ("We'll think of you every time we use them" didn't seem quite appropriate) and started surfing wedding etiquette sites. I found one that says that wedding thank you's should be written  two weeks  after returning from the honeymoon.   Ha! Our gifts hadn't even arrived two weeks later. Maybe we can get an extension for having a one-day honeymoon? And another one for moving cross-country into an apartment without room for us to even see all our stuff? And another one for being pregnant? And for moving again? Please?

       Tacoma Resident Begins Issuing Inter-Appliance Marriage Licenses   Tacoma resident Marcia Pritchards announced Monday that she was issuing a marriage license to her cat and her toaster, who plan to be married this Saturday.   Pritchards said she was inspired by the example of mayors around the nation issuing licenses to same-sex couples. "Then my cat and my toaster came to me, and I realized--they have a truly loving and caring relationship. How can we deny them this basic right?"  Although some have questioned her legal authority to grant such licenses, Pritchards remains adamant. "I think the laws are open to interpretation. What I go with is the Constitution, which guarantees equality. We can't deny my cat the right to marry the one he loves."  Pritchards said she would issue licenses to any other couple who requested them. "I think something's developing between my neighbor's lawnmower and the oak tree on the corner," she commented. "If they came to me I'd be delighted to marry them."

       Ramble on SSM   One of the best arguments against same-sex marriage from a secular standpoint is the harm it will do to children by dissasociating marriage from parenthood. Usually those arguing for SSM argue back that "gays make good parents, too" and that not all heterosexual couples want to/have children. Both of which are missing the point: a society in which marriage is only about the feelings of two people for each other is a society in which marriage is meaningless. And that is a society that is bad for children. In a recent  urlLink Weekly Standard article,  Stanley Kurtz demonstrates is not merely a theoretical one: This is in fact what has happened in Scandinavia, where gay marriage has been lawful for a decade.  In Scandinavia, half or nearly half of children are born out of wedlock. A decade ago the thing to do was get married when the second child came along; now it's not even worth bothering about then. And non-marital families are as proportionally unstable there as they are everywhere else in the world. Certainly this trend was already occurring, but gay marriage has been openly used to reinforce the idea that children do not particularly need both the man and woman who made them as a permanent part of their lives.  Obviously gay marriage does not even arise as an issue until social mores have already slid to a certain point. In America, we're still one step behind where most Scandinavian countries were a decade ago--it's still considered proper to marry before having children, although of course you will live together first. (DOB and I did not realize how common this assumption was in the wider culture until he started introducing me as his fiancee and people would make comments indicating this. He finally resorted to casually mentioning my residence in another state, although I'm sure this didn't change their assumptions much. Little did they know we weren't even allowed to sleep under the same roof during visits, no matter how many inquisitive siblings that roof also sheltered.)  However, Norway was at a similar level of social mores when gay marriage was imposed by the politicians--and it thereafter rapidly overtook the other Scandinavian countries in decline of the family, as well as decline of religious influence.   Apparently, then, attempting to stop the imposition of gay marriage now is a worthwhile endeavor, at least preventing the decline of morals from accelerating. But it will only be a temporary measure unless we can also rebuild the status of marriage. Obviously this cannot be done by laws alone, or even primarily through laws, since most of it has happened independent of law.  But how do we do it? Somehow goodness isn't as contagious as badness. Sure, being married is right and benefits us and our child(ren), as did waiting to act married until we actually were. But when a friend announces he is now engaged to his live-in girlfriend, do we respond? Bragging about one's morality seems as vulgar as bragging about immorality. And if one never says anything, how does one's marriage differ from anyone else's lifestyle choices?  It is vital to upholding the proper place of marriage for people to see and know about good marriages. Living well is the greatest force for changing the world. But how do you make it apparent to people that one's marital success is not due to a fortuitous coincidence of personalities, or of an extraordinary genetic endowment of martyrdom, but because one has tapped into the power of a universal principle?  Whatever it takes to be an example of good marriage, I'm sure it takes more than a successful six months. Unfortunately, those who should be examples are not. Yesterday's Wall Street Journal had an article on seniors living together. If Mom and Dad are divorced and Grandma lives with her boyfriend, where do you learn? At the end, a grandmother offered her prepared answer for when her nine-year-old grandson asked why she wasn't married: "Grandmom and Grandpop love each other and love you. We're all committed to each other. We don't need that in writing to be a family."  But any nine-year-old can see through that. If you meant it, you'd be willing to cross your heart and hope to die. We all know how the promise is made--and if you won't make it, all your other words don't mean a thing.

       The Cake Is Made   And it is very good. Since I only had one layer and it looked rather flat, I decided to cut it in thirds and make a three-layer cake. This worked quite well, except that it looks like I quietly ate two-thirds of a triple-decker cake this afternoon. Really, I didn't. Even pregnant I couldn't do that.

       Essential Recipes   I had plans this week to make spice cake with penuche icing. We're not big sweets eaters, but I like to fix a dessert for the weekend.   I found a recipe for spice cake, but then discovered none of my cookbooks had the right penuche icing recipe. (For those who don't peruse the cookbooks of a bygone era, penuche icing is a kind of creamy brown-sugar icing.) There were similar recipes, but they were not  the  recipe.   The more I thought about it, the more I realized I had to have the right recipe. That my day would not be complete without licking the leftover penuche icing in the pan. So I called my younger sister and had her find the page in the right recipe book (no doubt marred permanently by my adolescent cooking endeavors) and give it to me. Now all is well, except that I have to wait until the cake is all baked and cooled to make the frosting.  My sister also announced that she thinks the cat is expecting again. Do pregnant cats get cravings? "I've just got to have a little mole. No, a shrew will  not  do."

      And so the  urlLink breakdown  of law spreads.  I don't want same-sex marriage to be the battle of our times. I don't like this issue. It's gooky. I'm not satisfied with the secular arguments that can be made, and I don't want to make the religious ones.  But I don't think it's a side issue I can ignore, either. We don't always get to choose where the battles of our times will be.   Even if right now I'm not doing much besides trying to take over the world by numbers . . .

        The Passion    After much careful deliberation, DOB and I overcame our natural skinflintedness (compounded by trying to simultaneously pay for a new business, new house, and new baby) and general inbred prejudices against movie theaters and determined to go see  The Passion . It probably helped us in this decision that we are rather out of mainstream evangelical culture and nobody tried to talk us into going. So we could satisfy our contrarian tendencies and go to it to defy the critics and naysayers.  I was a little nervous because I'd never seen an R-rated movie before and I kept reading reviews by all these movie reviewers saying they found it overly gory--so if people who watch this stuff all the time were grossed out about it, how would I handle it? But the conclusion I have come to is that the people who complain about the violence are those who don't get  why . Yes, you sit there and wonder, "Why don't they stop doing this to him?" but if you are expecting to be reminded of the magnitude of Christ's suffering, you get what you are looking for. It is too much violence to be entertaining (unless you are a Roman soldier) but not too much to be devotional.  Some reviewers have complained that Pilate was portrayed too sympathetically, in contrast with the portrayal of the Sanhedrin. But Pilate's portrayal was one of the most powerful and convicting parts of the film. You feel convinced that you have met Pilate somewhere, at a conference or something. And gradually it dawns on you--Pilate is us. Pilate is a modern American. Most of us don't think of ourselves as the sole representatives of the One True God, nor are we debauched hereditary monarchs or trained sadistic brutes. We would have little identification with the Sanhedrin or Herod or the foot soldiers however they were portrayed. But Pilate is a businessman. A businessman with a crummy assignment in middle management and a pointy-wreathed boss breathing down his neck. In person, he wouldn't hurt a fly. But when faced with the choice between saving his skin and condemning a man whom he knows to be innocent and suspects to be divine, he chooses the expedient option. He feels bad about it, but what can he do? Who really knows the truth, anyway?  And as you watch him, you know that you could do the same.

      We have a playpen in our living room. Somebody at church gave it to us and I'm leaving it out partly because I mean to take it out and wash it down the next dry day and partly because I'm trying to adjust to the mental shock. It seems like it should belong to a visitor who will take it away. Or that it should be in someone else's house. The thought of us with a real, live, squirmy baby is still beyond comprehension.

       Tightwadding   Last night we went to a Bush campaign party (one of 5,000 or so being held simultaneously around the nation). That was all fine, but I confess I spent most of the evening being very nonpolitical and admiring the house and lands, which correspond very closely to my dream house. It was a pre-1850s farmhouse, beautifully restored (the wife was an interior designer and the husband apparently good at following orders) with the original fireplaces and hardwood floors in many rooms. It was set among big maples on a couple hundred acres of rolling berry farm.   This should fill me with renewed inspiration to learn from  The Tightwad Gazette , which I got from the library this week, and save as much money as possible.   My other distraction for the evening was trying to get Baby to settle down. I appreciate his political enthusiasm, but look forward to the day when he can express it in ways besides kicking me in the ribs.

       May Day   When I was a little girl, May Day was the occasion for two things: My grandmother singing "Today's the first of May, May, May; Today's the first of May" very, very off-key. (I still have no idea what the tune is.) And for making little construction paper baskets and filling them with stray flowers and leaving them on people's doorsteps.  Then I went to work in Olympia and found out that May Day was some sort of international holiday for the proletariat, characterized in Olympia by wealthy college students behaving despicably in the main streets, protesting they know not what (except perhaps public decency laws). Sensible people who had other options avoided downtown on May Day. Ohio is if anything more union-y than Washington, but I have heard no rumors that the holiday is celebrated as vigorously.  This year someone's adding a new option for celebration.  urlLink May Day for Marriage , a rally at Safeco Field in honor of traditional marriage. No doubt it will draw some lively folks on both sides of the debate. (This is Seattle, after all. Anybody remember WTO? At least this time people will know what they are protesting.) I don't see any signs of similar events in other states.   Perhaps all three holidays should be combined in some sort of "Free-Flowers-for-the-Marrying-Proletariat" celebration. This would be handy, as wedding flowers can get really expensive. (Tip to brides: Try Costco.)  I need to plant some May-blooming perennials so that Baby and I can make May baskets in 2007.

       Abortion March    urlLink Bunnie Diehl  has a host of pictures and commentary from the national abortion march last weekend. (Caution: Not for tender eyes or the faint of stomach.) The overwhelming feeling I've always got from seeing this kind of protest, in pictures or in person, is how very anti-life these people are. I don't just mean they support abortion; I mean they reject life and its goodness. They deny the personhood of children, and so they begin to destroy their own personhood and reduce themselves to slogans and causes and festering bitterness. One doesn't see many smiles at these rallies.  Even that quintessentially amoral Alfred P. Doolittle had a better perspective when one of his drinking chums asked what he'd ever given his daughter:   "Anything? I give her everything. I give her the greatest gift any human being can give to another: life.   "I introduced her to this here planet, I did, with all its wonders and marvels.  "The sun that shines, the moon that glows. Hyde Park to walk through on a fine spring night.   "The whole ruddy city of London to roam around in, sellin' her bloomin' flowers.  "I give her all that, then I disappears and leaves her on her own to enjoy it.   Now, if that ain't worth half a crown now and again, I'll take my belt off and give her what for. "  Because Doolittle still loved life, as corrupted as his version of it was, he can still be a lovable rascal. But who could write a comedy starring an angry feminist?

       One Thing Leads To Another   Things were going well on the housewife front this morning, albeit I was running a bit behind (as is typical on a Monday). The kitchen was clean from its weekend mess, the first load of laundry was started, my exercises were done, and the pot of beans for supper was cooking. Time for me to do my relaxation practice.   As usual, "relaxing" turned into "napping," at least the light dozy sort of napping where I'm vaguely aware of still being alive but not awake enough to give serious thought to getting up.   The next thing I became vividly aware of was that the house smelt like smoke. Now, I have much experience in burning beans (ask my younger siblings). I know there are degrees of burning. There is a certain point at which you can dump all but the bottom layer of beans into another pot, start over with fresh water, and have at worst a mildly smoky flavor. My siblings called it "Cajun" and learned to prefer their chili that way.  I didn't even have to look at the pot to know that this point was long past.   Naturally I was perturbed not only at wasting an entire pot of beans, but also wasting nearly the last of my distilled water--a few slack days towards the end of last week, the monthly distiller cleaning, and the aforementioned invasion of brothers-in-law had left us down to our last gallon.  As I was setting the pot outside and airing the house (fortunately it's a balmy spring day) it occurred to me that, after all, I was highly overdue to clean out the refrigerator. And under the sink. And test out the self-cleaning cycle on the oven. As long as the house stank that bad, I reasoned, it was the ideal time to do all other stinky tasks. They couldn't possibly make it any worse.  And thus a pot of burned beans turned into spring-cleaning the kitchen for the next three hours. The refrigerator is sparkling. Under the sink is sparkling. The oven racks are scrubbed. The oven is running the self-cleaning cycle. (I was wrong, it does stink worse than burned beans.) The sink is sparkling. (I discovered the sink cleaner also does wonders on my enamel bean pot.) The floor is clean. The dishwasher is running. The distiller is running. The washing machine is running.  I'm going to go take a nap now.

      This weekend's agenda involved taking the four youngest brothers-in-law (ages 11 to 17) to a baseball game and then having them spend the night, returning them at church the next day.  It was fun. It was crazy. There were moments when I wondered if I really wanted ten kids. But everything went quite well, and so far I haven't found anything broken. There was the little incident when one was washing up plastic baggies while the other one dried, and he mischievously placed a baggie loaded with dirty dishwater in the drain. The other one retaliated by dumping it in the sink. He did wipe up the resulting explosion.  There was also the incident with the oatmeal, but I suppose I can't really blame it on them. I was explaining the functioning of a catapult to one when DOB tried to bluff me on whether I would actually launch the catapult. So I did. On his face. And all over his church clothes. It was time to wash his glasses anyway.  And now everyone has left and things are very, very quiet. Ten kids would be fine. But I hope that by the time our oldest son is 10 we have a house with a barn. Boys need somewhere to go and be boys without driving their mother bonkers.

       Education   Yesterday WorldMagBlog had a vigorous  urlLink discussion  on home education, triggered by a remarkably stupid example of the public schools' bankruptcy of morality or common sense. This seems as good of an opportunity as any to post more thoughts on home education that have been running around in my head. (Hey, I've been looking forward to doing this for the last 15 years; I can't help getting excited now that the day is finally in sight.)  Since homeschooling as a modern movement didn't really get going until the early 80's, DOB and I will be among the first generation of homeschooling parents who themselves have never suffered from formal education. Thanks to our parents and the other pioneers, the prospect facing us is a much easier one.   The major hurdle in doing anything new is simply its newness. For people who thought education happened in a certain building by paid professionals between certain hours, taking their children away from that was very strange and scary. For us, sending our children to suffer through hours of drivel at the hands of strangers is what seems strange.  The classic objections to homeschooling seem silly to us. How will we teach them everything they need to know? Well, come on, if our  parents  could produce such brilliant people as ourselves, surely we can do as well. ;-) Adolescent arrogance aside, our parents were variously into engineering, speech therapy, and art. None of them knew anything about law except how to steer clear of it. All a child needs to be taught is how to read and write fluently and think coherently. Everything else he can find a way to learn if he wants to (and if he isn't smothered through decades of schooling, he probably will want to).  But the academic question has pretty much died down. Socialization is still raised, much to our amusement. I remember a few years ago I was schmoozing around in advance of speaking at a political event and fell into conversation with an older woman who was convinced her grandchildren would suffer horribly from lack of socialization because her daughter was homeschooling them. I'm still trying to compose exactly what smart remark I should have used in response. Meanwhile, DOB works in sales, of all things. We don't seem to be suffering from too much social misfittedness. I'm still not sure exactly what people are hoping for in socialization. Courtesy, respect, and kindness are not best taught by herds of eight-year-olds. Succumbing to the pack instinct is, but that's not a skill I particularly want my children to have.  Most significant, we have a radically different perspective on what education is. It's not something tied to a particular time and place; it has nothing to do with how much time you've spent or how much paper you've gone through. It doesn't start with a lunch box and end with a diploma. It's simply finding out new stuff all the time all the way through life: because you need to, because you want to, because the mind is a gift from God and it is a delight to use it.

       We Plow the Fields and Scatter   At long last, I planted herb seeds today, the one thing I am ambitious enough to attempt growing this year. I have spent the equivalent of 6 bunches of herbs on this project (dirt and seeds--growing trays graciously supplied by boxes from Aldi's and bags from Walmart). So I hope to get at least that much in returns.

       Music Selection    urlLink This blog  is having some interesting discussions on contemporary Christian music, dissecting the words of the  urlLink most popular CCM songs  and debating  urlLink how much CCM is good for you . There's more discussion  urlLink here . I just about died laughing at the critique of the AWANA Cubbies song--it's true, they're not happy all day long; I've lived with several. Makes me think more carefully about what songs I want to teach Baby.  OK, making fun of the vapidity of modern Christian music is fun, but the bigger question is, What should we be singing about? Which is especially relevant since DOB leads singing at our church and we pick out the music. After all, the week before the same blog deconstructed "Amazing Grace" from a Lutheran perspective. And some of the people on the discussion seem to take the position that every Christian song to be worthy of the name must explicitly refer to Christ and his work. Which seems unbalanced the other way to me--yes, that is the centerpiece, but there are times to talk about other things or refer to it implicitly.   Worship music is sort of a diet. I would be very interested to study the Psalms as a model of a balanced diet and see how much various topics came up. But for now I will just put up my rough dietary recommendations:  Bread (6-11 servings): The work of Christ. That is what being a Christian is all about, and the preponderance of our singing should be about that.  Meat and Milk (5-8 servings--these aren't quite the USDA recommendations but I like the analogy better this way): Doctrine about who God is, the Bible, etc. People in early growth stages (new Christians, children) probably need more of this category.  Fruits and Vegetables (4-7 servings): Personal testimonies of salvation, life as a Christian, songs of challenge, etc. Salvation is personal and it's good to talk about it, but some churches (especially conservative evangelical ones who haven't succumbed to CCM) spend the bulk of their time here and don't get into the more substantial stuff. Give us some protein, folks!  Fats and Sweets (Use sparingly): Songs about how I feel about God. It's OK to do this once in awhile, but not at the expense of losing sight of who God is and why we love him. This stuff tastes good and can fill you up temporarily, but doesn't give you any nutrients. (I haven't conducted a survey or even heard much of it, but it seems like the bulk of modern praise and worship songs fall in this category.)  Some other general comments on music selection: Bad grammar, illogic, and faulty doctrinal statements ought to go, no matter how beloved the song.   Scripture set to music is a great concept, as long as they put big enough chunks to music that one has the proper context. i.e., it's not an improvement over stupid lyrics to sing "God is love" over and over, even though that phrase can be found in the Bible.  As for styles, setting aside the question of whether any particular form of music is evil, couldn't everyone agree that not all forms of music are appropriate for all purposes? I doubt anyone would seriously contend that polka is demonic, but I don't know anyone suggesting that it's appropriate for church. Music written for dancing should stay in dancing settings; music written for seduction should stay in seductive settings. Music used in worship should sound worshipful.  As for time frame, I think everyone, whatever their inherent preferences, should make a serious effort to include worship music from different genres (with above caveat) and time periods in their diet. Every musical style and time period will reflect the prejudices and predominant issues of the people writing it. To get a balanced diet, you need to get outside one timeframe and hear from the saints of God through the ages. (This argument shamelessly stolen from C.S. Lewis, "On the Reading of Old Books.")   I might note that the aforementioned more conservative evangelical churches tend to dodge the modern praise and worship timeframe where we spend all our time singing about I Feel So Good About Jesus and instead stick to the music of the previous hundred years, which is predominantly about What Jesus Does for Me. It's still unbalanced (and the music tends to be dull, too). And the lack of doctrinal content paves the way for the I Feel Good About Jesus songs.  Wow, I think this is my longest post since same-sex marriage.

      How to be cool: Drive around with  urlLink  The Ride of the Valkyries   cranked up.   I actually can well imagine this could induce speeding. Maybe that's why one rarely hears the classical station play it.  Hey, even worse would be those songs that are really slow in some spots and really pounding in others. No doubt those drivers that DOB gets stuck behind who always go 70 in passing zones and 35 in no-passing zones are listening to  Bolero  or something.

      The other day DOB and I were making a list of top phrases you don't want to hear during surgery. Like this:   OK, now, which side was it on? Sterile, schmerile--we mopped yesterday. Hey, what's this doohickey for? Did anybody see where that sponge went? Was that in milligrams or micrograms? I must have slept through that lecture. Oooops.  But in the hospital  urlLink silence  may be even worse.

       Morning Has Broken   Today was the first day of DOB's new position. So naturally he needed to be there on time and all spruced up, not to mention hauling in all his computer equipment. The activities of the weekend left us with no free energy to prepare for this event, nor have we figured out a way to get to bed early on Sundays.   So naturally, it was also the morning when I ironed two shirts before I found one without stains, when the toilet backed up, when I remembered suddenly that I had to fix a lunch in addition to a breakfast and the only leftovers in the house was Mexican food that still needed to be assembled, and when the eggs burnt.  Anyway, he's safely off now.

       Spending Money  Went to a baby sale and a garage sale today; got various baby transporting equipment, a few books, and a few gender-neutral t-shirts and onesies. Including an adorable Fourth-of-July outfit with stars. Even though it's in the smallest size it looks huge. And it's not like we'll be up to going anywhere on the 4th. But it was so, yes, I'll say it,  cute . Besides, it was only 50 cents.  We've now completely exhausted our cash supplies. We didn't realize until we were heading out of the baby sale that they only took cash, so we had to quickly find a friend who had extra cash and would accept our check.

       Twists and Turns   DOB's knee is slowly improving, but it's obvious something has to change or he will just keep reinjuring it. Part of that something is his job, which as it stood involved long hours and a lot of time walking around, hunting down clients. (As he said, he could do great if he was just a senior representative and people would come to him.) So, almost exactly one year after deciding to take this job, and having spent down most of our savings trying to make it possible, we were casting about for something else. Some prayers are answered a lot faster than you expect. On Monday, DOB walked in to talk to another representative--the one with whom, a few weeks ago, he was interviewing assistants for in hopes of taking on one jointly. He starts work Monday, doing the desk part of the job while the other rep goes out and talks to people. He says it makes him feel sort of like Dick Cheney.

       Brain Implants   When I saw DOB reading an  urlLink article  on brain implants, I immediately thought, "Is there a list where we can submit names of candidates for implants?" Alas, though, it seems that even when the technology is fully functional it will only help people send signals from their brain, not create brains where none existed.

      Have been vegetating a lot this week, researching prices on baby stuff and reading a lot of  urlLink articles  on feminism, day care, and other modern plagues. And yet again it reminds me of Chesterton:  I remember my mother, the day that we met, A thing I shall never entirely forget; And I toy with the fancy that, young as I am, I should know her again if we met in a tram But mother is happy in turning a crank That increases the balance at somebody's bank; And I feel satisfaction that mother is free From the sinister task of attending to me.  They have brightened our room, that is spacious and cool, With diagrams used in the Idiot School, And Books for the Blind that will teach us to see; But mother is happy, for mother is free. For mother is dancing up forty-eight floors, For love of the Leeds International Stores, And the fame of that faith might perhaps have grown cold, With the care of a baby of seven weeks old.  For mother is happy in greasing a wheel For somebody else, who is cornering Steel; And though our one meeting was not very long, She took the occasion to sing me this song: 'O, hush thee, my baby, the time will soon come When thy sleep will be broken with hooting and hum; There are handles want turning and turning all day And knobs to be pressed in the usual way;  O hush thee, my baby, take rest while I croon, For Progress comes early, and Freedom too soon.'

      As can be seen in the margin, DOB has started his own blog,  The Ducal Herald . There are couples, after all, who get separate bathrooms. We don't mind sharing the bathroom, but we apparently need separate writing spaces. It's more like having two cars--sometimes we just have to head different places at the same time. But DOB is keeping his editorial status over here, and if he ever gets it to work I'll be able to post on his. So we'll still be able to comment back and forth.

       On The Line   Our phone line has been getting increasingly fuzzy over the last couple of weeks. I finally got to calling the phone company today. Over the fuzz, I talked with a lady who told me that if the problem was internal, I would either have to pay a $90/hour fee for inside service, fix it myself, or add inside service to my account for $3.95. But if I wanted the inside service I had to do it immediately, before she transferred me to the service department. I chose the last option, and was transferred to the service department where another lady explained that to test whether the problem was internal or external I would have to locate a gray box on my house, unscrew a screw, plug a phone in outside, and make a phone call to test it.  This sort of household fiddling is not my cup of tea and it has been pouring rain all day, but DOB is still on crutches and we were both very tired of the fuzz, which was making conversation nigh impossible. So I put on my raincoat (which fortunately is still buttonable) and boots, found a screwdriver, and ventured forth. Sure enough, right outside the garage door were a number of gray boxes with wires, and one of them had a special section just for customers to unscrew. To be sure it was a Phillips screw and the lady on the phone had said to take a flat-head driver, but it worked just fine to unscrew it, so I did not worry about it. Inside, howerver, there was no phone jack.  I was perplexed, so I summoned DOB, who donned crutches and slippers and hopped out to look. He informed me that this was the wrong box, and I must extend my search to the other end of the house. So he went back to work while I rescrewed that box and searched farther afield. Sure enough, at the other end of the house was yet another gray box (I had no idea houses had so many), this one not only with a friendly customer access option, but with a flat screw and a label that said "Phone Line." So I was pretty sure I was on the right track. I unscrewed it, and sure enough inside was a phone jack.  I turned to go inside and get the phone to plug in, when I suddenly felt myself lurching forward with my feet entangled. I looked down and saw a wire waving in the breeze, with a tag at the end that said, "If this wire is loose, call Verizon." Feeling a sense of dread, I went inside and discovered the phone line was, indeed, dead. I told DOB what had happened, and he put on his shoe and his jackets and hat and crutched out to look. He determined that the situation was serious, but suggested I test the phone in the box before calling Verizon just to make a full report.  So I came in, got the phone, plugged it in outside and stood in the pouring rain making a phone call. Sure enough, it worked fine. So I returned to report this to DOB and was about to call Verizon from the cell phone to report it when it occurred to me that I could make the call from the outside phone line. Faced with the option of standing in an ice cold downpour, my feet in a puddle, holding a large kitchen phone and a screwdriver while listening to hold music, or racking up cell phone minutes, I made the obvious choice.  I should have taken gloves, though. They answered surprisingly quickly, considering, and the fellow on the other end was very apologetic. "You're actually standing in the rain? O my g**, O my g**, Is the rain actually hitting you? Oh my g**, I'm so sorry." I was ready to dispense with the apologies and get on with fixing the phone. He informed me that the inside service was not showing up on my account, and that anyway the $3.95 was only if you waited 30 days for it to activate; immediate activation meant a $39.95 charge for the first month. I was standing in the rain and my feet were getting wet and our phones were dead. I said to go ahead and please send someone out ASAP. He promised someone by 3:25 tomorrow.  I returned inside, where DOB had verified that we still had internet access even though the phones were still dead. Mystifying. There seemed nothing to do but wait, so I dealt with a few remaining outdoor tasks, put on dry socks and tea, and sat down to collaborate on the spreadsheet he was working on. Shortly thereafter, the doorbell rang and outside stood the Verizon guy, coming by to check on how involved the problem was. He went out back to look, then came in a few moments later. We tried the phone lines: dial tone, no fuzz. The repairman reported that the phones were probably dead because I had jerked the connection out when I opened the thingamajooker in the box outside; as to the fuzz, well, maybe it had been loose. Anyway, it should be no charge so not to worry. Asked about the loose wire, he said it was just a grounding wire and he would go make sure it was secured. And off he went.  So now it looks like I paid $39.95 for nothing. I wonder if they'll let me take it off now. Bleh.

      The holiday meal is over and all has gone well. Everyone seemed to get enough to eat and have an enjoyable time. No dishes were broken (although I don't have them back in the cupboard yet, so the field is not entirely secured). We sat the four youngest boys in the kitchen, as the dining room only seats eight at maximum capacity. Midway through the meal, we were surprised to see them all simultaneously leap up and run out the back door (as we discovered later, to change their shirts in the van). Not knowing why but not lacking quick reflexes, we got up and locked all the doors. Then DOB's uncle and I took the kitchen table and rotated it 90 degrees.

      Tomorrow we host our first holiday meal here. I am running around ironing napkins and picking flowers. We have borrowed a brother to assist me in setting up. And I have come to a vital conclusion: We need more girls in this family. Raymond is doing a fine job, but somehow he just isn't sufficiently impressed over the way I used prickle balls from the backyard to raise the height of the flowers in the vase. Nor can I get any profound comments from anyone around here over whether these napkins look all right with those placemats.   Although it was frequently exhausting, I miss the convergence of female creativity that erupted around holidays when I was growing up.

       Political Stuffs   Cato Institute is cool. World Magazine is cool. A joint article is even cooler, like this  urlLink excellent article  by Doug Bandow on a Biblical understanding of the role of civil government.  Ohio has risen to third in state and local tax burden, according to  urlLink this year's report  by the Tax Foundation. It's lower down on federal tax burden, probably because we're taxed too much to make enough money to  owe  federal taxes--I know our federal tax refund will be more than ample to cover state and local taxes.  And on a very tangential note, our accountant has a beautiful reception area. Deep red walls with white trim, light wood floor, traditional but simple furniture. Very bright and open and warm and inviting. Cozy but not stuffy. It's almost enough to make you feel good about tax time.  Almost.

       Men, Women and Babies  Yesterday's Dear Abby contained a letter to the following effect:  "When I date a man, I wine and dine him with gifts and candlelight dinners, but they never seem to be appreciated. Not only that, none of them ever do anything for me. I am always being stood up, heartbroken, used or taken advantage of."  I have a hard time believing people can be this dense, but I have seen evidence that they are. This woman has no doubt grown up believing men and women are essentially the same, No doubt she was raised to believe that as a woman she can just go out and get whatever she wanted, and her mother never mentioned that catching a man requires a certain amount of aloofness. So she just goes out and chases a man the way  she'd  like to be chased--and then is bewildered when it doesn't work.  But despite all kinds of attempts at cultural re-education, it turns out that Grandma was right all along. Men are pushovers, if you know how to handle them--but they can't be treated like women.   Unfortunately, our whole culture tends to make women by default responsible to take the initiative in the direction of a relationship, so no wonder they get confused as to who should do what. The modern relationship pattern seems to be for things to just drift along, the man getting as much as he can while committing as little as he can, until the woman insists upon having "The Talk" about what exactly is going on. Under the older pattern, men were generally expected to indicate their intentions at clearly-defined points. If they failed to do so, the woman usually had a father or brothers around to demand an explanation.  On other fronts, the knee is improving slowly, with much icing. I took the Rhogam shot yesterday, and while we were waiting for the post-shot checkup, we toured the Mother-Baby Center of the new hospital. Everything is brand spanking new, with private rooms with cushy chairs for everyone but me, nice big private bathrooms, and waiting cradles. Putting someone in one of those cradles is still beyond imagination.

       The Citadel Under Siege   Still not sure what is up with the knee, but it could be just a bad sprain; the kneecap appears to have put itself back in, at least. It still is a blasted nuisance. It's not the great tragedies and catastrophes that are draining in life; when the world stops, you can stop to deal with it and feel the proper object of sympathy. It's the little things that you have to go right on living through that wear you out. On which sympathy comes in the form of "I can top that story."  This is also the week I have to get my Rhogam shot (in case of incompatibility with Baby's blood type), which involves two trips to the hospital lab, on top of my now bi-weekly checkup. So we are spending an unconscionable amount of time at medical offices.  But then, the sky and the grass and the daffodils are brilliant colors this morning; last night's spaghetti turned out particularly well; the thank-you notes are mailed at last; there is more space on the office floor; and I'm finally going to get up and give the house a long-overdue vaccuumming. It's also the little things, not the huge celebrations, that make life livable.

      On our way to the chiropractor this morning, to get DOB's busted knee checked out. In honor of the occasion, a Chesterton quote:   "The center of every man's existence is a dream. Death, disease, insanity, are merely material accidents, like a toothache or a twisted ankle. That these brutal forces always besiege and often capture the citadel does not prove that they are the citadel."

       Home Education  This week when I called home I could hear my 4-year-old nephew in the background waking up from his nap. Sidetracked from hunting for his mom, he first sat down and colored a picture of Abraham and Sarah, receiving occasional clarifications on the story from my older sister. Then he asked something of my younger sister, which launched a lesson on telling time, complete with ripping the clock off the wall and spinning the hands around. The hour hand concept was easily mastered; when he got to the minute hand, however, counting by fives proved too difficult. This launched a consultation between the three of us on how to set up a number line so he could practice skip-counting until it was easy. Then he took a turn talking to me and told me about the clocks, along with the dirt pile in the garden and the monsters on Sarah's computer game.  Nobody wrote a lesson plan or plotted months in advance that today was the day to tell time. Nobody bought a fancy curriculum or handy little classroom gizmos. Nobody handed him a worksheet and said, "Finish this or get in trouble." Nobody forced him to take a test. A little boy wanted to know something, so he asked someone who knew, and they taught him. That's how education is supposed to work.  That's how I remember it working, growing up. I remember my oldest brother teaching me addition in the car. A friend of my sister's showing my four-year-old fingers how to follow the notes of "First March." Sitting on my dad's lap at six and trying to fathom the mysteries of algebra at the same time as my 13-year-old brother. Mom using long-lost leftovers as a lesson in microbiology. My grandfather deciding his two middle grandchildren needed lessons in surveying, shed painting, and tractor driving (lessons at which my younger brother outstripped me as far as I did him at spelling).   And it wasn't long before I was returning the favor: editing my mom's letters so they would be less polemic and more persuasive; lecturing at the dinner table on the evils of government intervention; training my youngest brother in reading and math. Teacher and student, training and practice, were not fixed categories, but based on the realities of the moment.  Education doesn't take fancy curriculum or years of training or a set class of "teachers" who have all the answers. It takes people living and working together, sharing their excitement about the things they know and curiosity about the things they don't. We've got scrap paper, pens, a Bible, two dictionaries, a library card, and we think the world is a fascinating place. We're all set, Baby, just as soon as you are ready.

       An Evolved Understanding   Even the slightest hint of questioning the orthodoxy of evolution, as everyone knows, calls down fire and brimstone for violation of the First Amendment. Even if you don't mention the "c" word or the "g" word.   But what if you want to use religion to  endorse  evolution? Ah, that's a different matter entirely. The National Center for Science Education, a private organization dedicated to promoting teaching evolution (is that all there is to science?), has used a government grant to develop a website to help public school teachers teach evolution. Among the resources are  urlLink links  back to quotes from religious organizations on how believing evolution is just fine. They even use the "c" and "g" words!   So what's the real state of the First Amendment? The establishment clause is already defunct. We have an established religion: it's called scientific materialism, the worship of blind material processes. Anything that furthers this religion is allowed; anything that detracts from it is prohibited.

       Barefoot and Pregnant   I have recently discovered why being barefoot and pregnant go together. It's not about male oppression--I think it's about increased circulation. Whatever it is, my feet are hot. It's early April and I have already abandoned boots for sandals, and even played baseball barefoot in the mud last weekend. This is a strange development, as I was formerly inclined to cold feet, taking after my mother who, according to my father's theory, used to soak hers in ice water before crawling into bed. Now I'd rather hang mine over the edge of the bed to catch the night breezes. And as for wearing shoes at home--why bother?  Time to go back to the kitchen. ;-)

       Murdered by Pirates is Good   We spent part of the weekend remedying DOB's ignorance of  The Princess Bride , which he had never watched. (Inconceivable, I know.) So now he knows the virtues of the MLT, the key distinction between "mostly dead" and "all dead," and why you should never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line.   We are hoping, before the DVD returns to the library, to watch enough of it in Spanish to get down the Spanish words for, "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."

       Christmas Cookies   While out for my morning constitutional, I spied a garage sale and naturally was loathe to pass it up. Sure enough, not only did it have a charming assortment of baby clothes (ah, if only I knew Baby was a boy, they had the greatest little tool outfits), it had a practically-new spritz gun for $2! So I bought it.  Spritzes are those little fancy-shaped pressed cookies that turn up at Christmas. Most people, unfortunately, are only familiar with the generic white kind (perhaps with colored sprinkles for the truly venturesome) and have no idea of the varieties possible. Over many years, my family, in their relentless pursuit of Christmas cookie perfection, has developed countless striking varieties: green peppermint trees with chocolate drizzle; lemon stars with poppy seeds; cherry hearts; poinsettias, complete with leaves and yellow centers; coconut snowmen; gingerbread; orange dipped in chocolate. And then there were the stranger varieties, like the Little Green Men we made the year I accidentally put too much blue icing in the too-yellow coconut dough, and wound up with green rather than white. The next year we refined this concept and made Grinches, with little peanut butter Max the Dogs.   I love spritz. They are easier than rolled cookies and fancier than bar or drop cookies. They are vaguely Scandinavian, although they're more widely appropriated now than, say, krumkaka (which I still haven't attempted on my own, not even with my snazzy electric griddle).  And no doubt my weird aunt and older sister are recoiling with shock to imagine me thinking about Christmas cookies in May, when I ordinarily scream with horror if the topic comes up before November. (Well, I scream then, too, but I don't think it premature.)

       Cool Developments   Marsha has  urlLink succumbed  and joined the ranks of bloggers. She hasn't had a chance to post something of substance yet, but brilliant thoughts are no doubt coming soon. Also her template is very elegant. I might have to change mine.  DOB and I have been invited to go (free) to the  urlLink Buckeye Institute's  Evening with John Stossell next week. Way cool. (Even cooler will be if I can get some research work from them.)   The granola Kristen made on Wednesday is delicious. Can't believe this is the same rolled cereal we gagged down hot all winter.

       Pirates Who Don't Do Anything   I spent yesterday reading  Treasure Island  from cover to cover while watching my sister-in-law make granola and cookies and tortillas for when Baby arrives. The  Treasure Island  frenzy was on DOB's insistence, when he discovered I had never read it. (After reading it, I think perhaps I might have once, but if so it was when I was so young that I didn't remember what happened, anyway.) Great fun.   The degree of laziness was due to a slight cold. Not a very impressive excuse, but when you add slight-cold-tiredness to eight-months-pregnant tiredness to long-trip-over-the-weekend tiredness, you achieve a fairly high degree of tiredness.  I'm feeling a little better today. It's my day to do office work, although at some point I must go face the pile of dishes.  Also, my order of diapers just arrived.

       Vermont: An Endangered Species   So it seems that the National Trust for Historic Preservation has listed Vermont as  urlLink "endangered,"  due to a sinister threat from Walmart.  One could mock the arrogant elitists who think that other people should be forced to pay more at quaint stores. More power to those who are happy paying more for their bread and butter, but some of us are working hard to stay alive out here.  But I have a sneaking sympathy for the elitists, just the same. I mourn the passage of the oddities of the world. Certainly a life raising sheep in the Scottish Highlands, or busting sod on the vast prairie, or fishing in small, leaky boats is not one I'd choose over a life of relative comfort in suburbia, but I still can be sorry that those times have passed and want to preserve the beautiful things that ordinary people were able to make out of adversity.  I do shop at Walmart, every week as a general rule. But until last month I religiously bought my meat at Wilson's Meat Locker down the street from DOB's family, where the owner knew my name and inquired about how the baby was doing. The meat wasn't as cheap as I could have scrounged by scouring sales, but it was reasonably priced, from local sources, and I don't think any chain store would have offered me bottom round roast for the same price as chuck just because they were out of chuck. (Indeed, they wouldn't even offer me Orville Redenbacher popcorn for less when they were out of store brand, leading to a tragic Sunday night without popcorn.) But last month the shop went out of business after several decades. As I went in to pick up my last meat order, I heard the owner on the phone, griping, "I could never charge enough to make up for all the hassle of running this business these days."  The real threat to small businesses does not come directly from big businesses underselling them. Walmart undersold Wilson's, but Wilson's had its own niche that offset Walmart's price advantage. The threat comes from government regulations that make it too difficult to operate a business. A huge chain can spread out the costs of complying with the government over a much greater area, lowering its costs (and thus allowing it to lower its prices while still making a profit). Further, a big business has the clout to lobby for exemptions.  It doesn't take too much imagination or research to come up with more advantages big businesses have that are due to government interference rather than some supposed excess of the free market. "Eminent domain" takings of private land to then be resold to private developers. Restrictive zoning laws that melt away in the face of a large potential tax base. Special grants to assist businesses and special tax breaks to help only the favored few.  The trouble is, it's those people who are now clamoring against Walmart who created the regulatory system that favors the large and the powerful businesses over the small, local ones. Government interference, no matter how well-intentioned, will always serve the interests of the large, the wealthy, and the well-organized, because they are the ones who have the resources to figure out how to get on the state's good side. Whereas the free market just might favor the guy down the street who cuts you a special deal on roast.

       Another Birth Story   I wonder what the childbirth instructors who are busy training husbands to help would think of this one. (From  Mrs. Mike , an Indian midwife is talking to the wife of a Mountie.)  "Yes, you think of your next baby. I have ready for you." She reached over the table and fumbled in an open cupboard. "Many hundred babies I am the first to see. And only one die. Every one I save with squaw root." She chuckled. "You take every day, and I tell you, when baby come you not even know it, no! Once I play good joke on Louis, my husband, I am near my time, big like vinegar barrel. I am cooking dinner. I say, 'Louis, we need wood!' He say, 'We have plenty.' I say, 'Louis, chop wood!' He look at me and shrug his shoulders. I turn my back, take big chew of squaw root. He pick up ax, walk out. Let me tell you, when he come back with split wood, there is twins in the bed, and I am back cooking dinner. But he is a man, he is blind, he sit down and eat. 'Coffee strong enough?' I say. He say, 'Yes.' Then both babies cry. He look around! ' Sacre bleu! ' he say French. He run to bed. Where they come from? He hit his head with both hands. It was good joke, Mrs. Mike, best joke I ever make."

       Things Brewing at Home   A warm weekend in an unsupervised house is likely to result in some surprises for the homeowners when they return. One of which was that I forgot to take out the garbage before I left. Bleck.  On a more interesting note, my Viking former co-worker will be gratified to learn that I think I made mead over the weekend. At least, I had a watered-down jar of honey used for pancake syrup that has gotten foamy and developed an odd, unhoneylike smell. It doesn't smell like Drano, though, so I don't think it's gotten all the way there yet.  No, I'm not going to taste it.

       I Left My Car in Hicksville   The weekend meeting of the Ohio Young Republicans in Toledo went well. DOB presided over a smooth debate of rules and platform, including a lively but cordial discussion on our position over gay marriage. I was duly elected secretary and took a lot of notes on the back of programs, because I had forgotten to bring any notepads. However, I understand the expectations for secretary in the League are relatively low, showing up being sufficient for me to rank among the most dedicated. We ate well and had a room with a great view of the fireworks shot off at the ballpark each evening.  On our way home on Sunday, we had made plans to visit a friend in Hicksville (it's really on the map) and attend her church. On the way down, the a/c quit, then funny noises and smells began to arise, and at last we pulled over just outside of town and the car died altogether. I threatened to go into labor on the side of the road just to round out the experience, but Baby seemed content to stay put.  Over the course of the afternoon we found a mechanic who diagnosed a blown head gasket. We were still over two hours from home. But to make it there we wound up going the other direction, into Indiana (througha terrific thunderstorm), to rent a car at the nearest airport. So we arrived home very late, very tired, and considerably poorer than we had budgeted for. (We will probably have the mechanic up there fix the car and have someone bring it down next time DOB's family goes to Michigan.)  But, we were home in one piece! And now I must go deal with the aftermath of the trip. I might go make the bed. Then again, I might just crawl back in it.

       Brief Update   A gazillion things to do today, and limited energy to do them with, as we are leaving for a Young Republican convention in Toledo this afternoon. Some random updates:  We finished birthing class! Now we know everything we need to know. Ha! Anyway, we now know what the Fetal Heimlich Maneuver is, and I bet you don't.  To keep you occupied while enhancing your economic knowledge, play " urlLink The Tragedy of the Bunnies ." I wish I had designed something like this, but I never could come up with enough justification for buying Flash software.  Ten thousand blessings to the person who invented air conditioning. We have finally had ours serviced and turned on. Life is beautiful. I can actually eat supper again.

       Government is Evil, er, Stupid   DOB and I have different generic words of disgust. I usually describe things I despise as "evil" or possibly "gross," depending on their nature. DOB, on the other hand, uses "stupid" across the board. I have to admit, though, the anti-government thoughts running through my head today fit "stupid" better than "evil."  1) My good friend Marsha, whose only threat to civil society is her borderline anarcho-libertarian views, is being forced to pay a significant fine for the "offense" of owning up to a forgotten handgun in her purse after the airport security failed to catch it. She is the most conscientious person I know, and so of course she must be fined for her honesty. What, exactly, does this accomplish for national security? Obviously the logical thing for her to do next time she forgets her gun is to keep her mouth shut and hope all the remaining security screeners are equally inattentive.  2) My father has owned a small farm for over 30 years, kept more for the purpose of relieving stress and occupying children than out of any attempt at monetary gain. Now he wishes to divide the farm so that my brother can build on a portion of it. As expected, this involves incomprehensible complexity and expense in surveying, satisfying wetlands concerns, zoning issues, etc. The icing on the cake, though, is that he has now discovered he is supposed to have a "farm plan." Not only that, but the "farm plan" is being developed by some bureaucrats who came out and briefly surveyed the farm. (Fortunately Dad got the manure shed cleaned out before they came.) How soviet can you get? A brief survey of the county website indicates that this plan is tied in to getting the tax break for having agricultural land, but why is it not sufficient to prove that you have, in fact, used the land as a farm? Do the bureaucrats really think we can't farm without their all-wise guidance?  Then again, maybe "evil" is the better term.

       Extreme Ironing  New sport of the day:  urlLink Extreme Ironing . The idea is to take an iron and ironing board to some remote location and iron there.  My thought? Ironing on Mount Everest is nothing compared to trying to get a shirt ironed while getting dressed, cooking breakfast, packing lunch, and making the bed, all with a 20-minute deadline. And in this sport, the quality of the ironing matters. (I have my doubts that garments ironed underwater come out very crisp.)   For experienced athletes, add toddlers underfoot.

      We invited another couple from church over Saturday night and got to try out having small children in the house for the first time. (They have a 3-year-old, a 1-year-old, and one due later this summer.)   1. I might wash the sliding glass door once this summer, but next year it will be pointless.  2. A house that one can traverse in a full circle is an incredible asset that, by itself, can keep small children amused for hours. When you add a dad to chase, no other toys are needed.   3. Small children suffer minor injuries once every 20 minutes and major ones once every other day. Eventually you cease to be traumatized by it.   4. Throwing an afghan over one's head creates a surprisingly effective hide-and-seek location.

       Household Mysteries   I was moving the load of towels from the washing machine to the dryer, when I found a paintbrush. A regular old scummy paint-the-wall paintbrush.  How did it get there? Where did it come from? What was it used for?  Fortunately I didn't see signs of paint all over my laundry, but it is still disturbing.  Another mystery, although perhaps not so deep of a one, is the bathtub drain. It seems to have been designed to catch the maximum amount of hair and then entangle it in such a way that it cannot be removed. Perhaps the purpose is to prevent the pipes from being clogged. But why should I applaud this endeavor when the effect on drainage is exactly the same?   Maybe it has a way to easily come apart and take the hair out, but the only sign I see is a big rusty screw in the middle that I don't have the nerve to touch.

       In Which I Visit the Library  I stopped at the library on my way home from DOB's office yesterday. At last I could resist the allure of the children's section no longer. I wound up with seven books from there, which isn't too excessive, I suppose, if you ignore the little detail that my oldest child can't even look at the pictures yet. (Most of them were song books, though, and he  can  hear music. And no doubt he will benefit greatly in later life from the fact that I now can learn all the words to "Do Your Ears Hang Low?")   I love libraries. I wish they weren't an evil government socialist program. I would pay for them if anyone would offer a paid one. (Actually my sisters are working on just that. But it will be on the other side of the country, so it won't help me assuage my conscience.)

       Architectural Evolution   One of my favorite morning walks is down a nearby street that has a uniquely charming assortment of houses. If you look at it, you realize that the houses were once all roughly alike, a row of little white squares, probably built in the early fifties and probably still lived in by many of their original owners.  But the passage of fifty years has changed much. Different folks have added on to their houses in different ways. A porch here; gabled attic windows next door; a pop-out window on the house next to that. Some brave souls painted theirs a soft yellow with blue trim. One yard has a spectacular flower garden; another has a great climbing tree. The overall effect is lovely and not at all monotonous.  This gives me two thoughts. One, although I thought I liked variety in a neighborhood, I have realized that a truly charming neighborhood needs a certain amount of commonality, too. Adobe next to tudor next to ranch next to victorian is too much. It's good that there tends to be common elements in homes built close together (dictated by the history and geography of the location), but each interpreted by someone different.  Second, perhaps there is, after all, hope for the modern monstrosities of planned communities. Perhaps someday, after the restrictive covenants expire and the aesthetic committees die off, things will begin to change. Time and human ingenuity (not wholly supressed by mass-production) will soften the edges. Someone will dare to use a paint color that is  not  a shade of beige. Someone will abandon their structured flowerbeds and put in an overflowing cottage garden with a white picket fence. Someone will discover that big front porches are still an essential part of a home. Little changes, here and there, will turn the monotony into a canvas on which variety can be displayed.

       Minorly irritated   Our birthing story went over well, despite being six times as long as anyone else's. (Apparently I took "story" too literally; no one else included dialogue or even stream-of-consciousness reflections.) So that was good. We have all been such good students we will get done a week early, so next week is our last.  However, I seem to have lost my mind entirely today. I forgot to pack DOB's lunch, so he is having to subsist (as far as I know) on a biscuit with jam left from breakfast. And today is the day he works late. Also today I was taking him in all his pens and his special flag mug to keep them in, and I foolishly thought I could carry that  and  two large, heavy upright file sorters. And navigate three doors unassisted. So I broke the mug.   I promise, DOB, I am not still upset at myself. Just very slightly perturbed.

       Norwegian Birth Story   Today's assignment for birthing class is to write our anticipated story of birth. I'm not sure what the purpose of this is, since the one thing I'm fairly certain is true about birth is that it doesn't go according to predictions.  Still, the assignment is putting me in mind of some of my favorite literary birth stories. Particularly this one, from  Mama's Bank Account . The setting is a Norwegian immigrant family living in San Francisco in the early twentieth century; this scene closes the book with the birth of Mama's first grandchild.  ************* I was at school teaching the day they took Christine to the hospital, and when the telephone call came, I got another teacher to take my class and hurried over there.  Mama was waiting for me in the hall.  "They will not let me see her," she said simply.  And her eyes were as stark as they had been on the long-ago day when Dagmar had been wheeled down a hospital corridor away from her--as the time Papa had been so ill.  We waited together outside Christine's door until Nels and Frank came out.  "How is she?" Mama asked anxiously.  Nels shook his head and Frank took hold of both of Mama's hands, as if for comfort.  "But what is  wrong ?"  "Christine believes," Nels said hopelessly, "that she is going to die."  "But--is she?"  Frank looked down at Mama's hands for a long time.  When he looked up, his young face was gaunt. "She is. Unless she gives us some help. Nothing we say--She's not having an easy time. Now she's given up completely."  Mama took her hands out of Frank's and straightened her hat.  "I go in," she said.  "I'm afraid it wouldn't do any good, Mama," Nels said. "It might even be bad for her. One look at your face--"  "Then I will change my face. Like this. See?" Mama smiled valiantly.  Nels put his arm around Mama's shoulder. "No."  "But I'm her Mama."  "And I'm her brother and Frank is her husband. We love Christine, too. Believe me, we're doing everything we can. We're doctors."  "Yes," Mama said mildly, "But have you ever had a baby?"  And with that, she marched directly into Christine's room, beckoning me to follow.  Christine's face was white and still against the pillow.  "Mama?"   "Yes, Christine."  "Oh, Mama, will you take my baby--afterwards?" Christine's voice seemed caught in her throat. "We children were so happy, so safe. Mama, will you?"  Mama walked over to the window and raised the shade.  "And what," she wanted to know, "will you be doing while I'm raising your baby?"  "Tears coursed down Christine's cheeks. "Didn't they tell you? Don't you know? I-I won't be here."  "And I always thought," Mama said quietly, "that Katrin was the dramatic one."  "Mama! What do you mean?"  "I remember now, Christine, that you are the stubborn one."  Christine buried her face in the pillow. "Oh, you still don't understand. I'm going to die!"  Mama's voice was even. "I had five children. And with every one, I too was certain I was going to die."  "But I  know . I'm a nurse."  Mama walked over to the bed and looked down at Christine.  "Perhaps," she suggested, "It will be better if you stop being a nurse and start becoming a mother."  Christine closed her eyes and sighed wearily.  A student nurse tiptoed in with a tray. "Though I don't suppose," she whispered compassionately, "that she'll be able to eat a thing."  Christine moaned softly and Mama said, "Please leave the tray, anyhow."  After the nurse had gone, Mama took the silver covers off the dishes and poured tea from the pitcher. I saw how her hands trembled, and I stepped back against the wall so that Christine could not see the tears in my eyes.  "Will you eat, my Christine? There is chicken here. And mashed potatoes."  Christine moaned again.  "I will feed you if you like. Perhaps you will try to drink a little of the hot tea?"  Christine shook her head, but did not open her eyes.  Mama said, "Is a shame to waste good food."  And Mama sat down by the tray and slowly, methodically, she began to eat Christine's lunch.  Christine's eyes flew open. "Mama! What are you doing?"  "Eating your lunch."  "But--but--" Christine sat up in bed. "How can you sit there and eat when I'm-- Mama, aren't you worried about me at all?"  Mama shook her head stoically. "You are doing fine. You are just like me. I never could eat, either."  Then Christine began to laugh to herself. She laughed between the spasms of pain, while Mama helped her walk back and forth across the room, and she was still smiling when they wheeled her into the operating room, where she was safely delivered of a seven-pound baby boy.  When Nels came out and said that Christine was fine and that there was nothing more to worry about, Mama's hands stopped trembling.  She leaned on my arm, though, as we walked down the hall to the glass-paned nursery.  A nurse held up a tiny blanketed figure and Mama peered at the wrinkled, yawning little face.  "I think," she said, "he has Papa's nose. And--yes, he has Christine's mouth."  "Oh, Mama! As if you could tell! He looks like a little boiled lobster."  "Why Katrin--he is a beautiful baby. As you were. All my children were beautiful babies."  My thoughts were back in Christine's hospital room.  "Five times," I said wonderingly. "Five times. And all you went through raising us--"  "It was good," Mama said.  "How can you say that? Why, I can remember times, Mama--"  "It was good," Mama repeated firmly. "All of it."

       Random Observations   1. Relaxation is where you find it. Rational people might not think that a man on crutches and a woman seven and a half months pregnant would find hiking at the lake the best form of relaxation. But it was fun. And yes, we were both too tired to see straight afterwards.  2. I have now learned how to open the gas cap on the station wagon. This has been a long source of frustration for me, culminating two weeks ago when I spent ten minutes at the attempt and finally gave up. DOB gave me lessons on Saturday and had me practice until he was sure I had grasped the principle.  3. Distressing news: Abigail is one of the  urlLink top ten  girl's names. How could we have sunk so low as to choose a popular name?   4. Yard sales are cool. This weekend I found assorted pristine cotton baby outfits and blankets, three fabric sunflowers that match the bedroom, and a very sturdy little wooden rocking horse. Total expenditure: $5.

       Thoughts on a More Somber Note   I thought what  urlLink Linda Chavez  said about the Iraqi prisoner issue struck most true. My gut reaction on hearing that many of the accused guards were women was, "Wait a minute, women don't do that kind of thing." They don't . . . unless they're trying hard to prove that they can be "one of the guys." Women are wired to want male approval. If their situation and the character of the men around them makes it impossible for them to attain it in traditional ways, they will use whatever means they have.  Hey, I remember being a junior high tomboy, first becoming dimly aware that male attention was desirable, and proceeding to beat as many boys as possible in arm-wrestling contests. Eventually the boys got bigger and I had the sense and training to realize that this was not the most effective approach. (I debated them instead. But I wound up marrying the guy who could out-debate me. ;-) )  Systemized killing of human beings is a disgusting, but sometimes necessary, job. It is a distinctly masculine job: physically, hormonally, emotionally. It is the antithesis of giving life, which is the exclusive province of women. The more women are assigned to perform that job, the more they have to deny who they are. Yet they are still young, surrounded by attractive young men, and earnestly desiring male attention. So some of them try to get it by out-guying the guys.   Women could tame the Wild West because they could go to the West and still be women. They could even take up arms on occasion, when they were defending their own homes and families, without denying that role. But women can't civilize the military, which by nature is anti-civil and anti-life. What they can do is abdicate their role as an outside check on what the men do.

       Unplanned Parenthood   In our first getting-to-know-you interview with our doctor, several months ago, things went amazingly smoothly. We were prepared for a clash of philosophy on how best to conduct childbirth, but none arose. But I wasn't prepared for how jarring I would find one of her questions for us:  "Was it planned?"  We looked at each other sheepishly. Sure, we had hoped to have children someday. And we were well aware that they were liable to occur. But planning was something done with spreadsheets and calculators; it seemed too formal of a word to apply to our laissez-faire approach. And, truth to tell, we had been a little surprised at our rapid success. Yet without the imprimatur of the word "planned" it sounded as if we were being irresponsible.  But something else bothered me, which I am just now putting my finger on. The question and distinction by themselves unconsciously reflect the disregard our culture has for childbearing and even for children.  The former distinguishing mark of a problematic pregnancy was an "unwed" pregnancy. This drew a clear-cut moral line based on an outside standard: if you were married, getting pregnant was acceptable; if you weren't, it wasn't. Sure, married women often found their pregnancies inconvenient, but then, most of life is inconvenient. You deal with it.  An "unplanned" pregnancy, in contrast, draws no moral distinctions except one of self-actualization. Does this baby fit into your goals? Did he make a previous appointment on your schedule? Is he meeting your current perceived needs? If not, then clearly you have a problem. If he is, then there is no question of the morality of your actions. With "planning" the primary concern, babies cease to be ends and become means.   The other evening, DOB and I were discussing one of those no-brainer studies that stated that, although babies could hear in utero and talking to them is fun, no evidence showed that prenatal education programs would make them smarter.  What seemed strange to us was that people would go to such lengths--but then, DOB pointed out, it's a symptom of this attitude towards children. How many people nowadays have children to reach some other goal of the parents, whether it's to keep up with their friends, gratify their own egotism, attempt to patch the void left by an unsatisfactory marriage, or simply because children, like SUV's, are a proper accessory to middle-class life? So naturally people whose childbearing purpose is intellectual exhibitionism are willing to try anything to give their child an edge--whether it helps, hurts, or is indifferent.  The "planned" distinction also drives a further wedge between sex and childbearing. Chances are very, very slim that the people involved didn't know where babies come from; yet we expect that we should be able to indulge in any pleasure we want without accepting the natural consequences. We call people who try to indulge in food this way bulimic. And it's a mindset with severe consequences, both physical and psychological.  But food was meant to be digested, and sex was meant to make babies. And sometimes it happens despite all our "plans."  I've seen what happens afterwards; the mothers sitting together, one whispering with the tiniest edge of resentment in her voice, "Of course,  this  one was a big surprise." The child seems to be ignoring the dull adult conversation, but can the attitude not affect them?   Planning, is, of course, a good thing. We're all for it. We like our spreadsheets. But the planning should be  for  the babies, not  of  them. When you got married, you issued an open invitation. Make plans for your guests, but don't greet them with the announcement that you would have preferred it if they hadn't come.

       This Week's Project . . .    . . . is to lay out a four-page newsletter, for which I have, in the way of material, one rambling essay on the many delightful activities of one out of 20 clubs, which must be condensed down to bullets; one bullet-point list on the features of the state convention, which must be expanded into a feature story; one very brief feature on Ohio's tax climate, which I wrote myself; and an oddly-designed picture of an elephant that I hope will pass muster as a logo.  No responses yet to emails requesting info/articles from people who are supposed to be supplying them. Can't get the printer to work.  I forget just how hard this is. Not the editing and design hassles so much as just plain writing. How hard can it be to come up with three paragraphs paraphrasing a tax study? To write a brief update on what a club is doing? Maybe I'm just frustrated with the mundaneness of the material. It's not the Great American Novel, it's just a club newsletter.  On the other hand, material shouldn't dictate all the limits. Maybe Julia Childs couldn't come up with the greatest of gourmet dinners with ingredients in my kitchen (sorry, no wine for the sauce), but what she cooked would still be well done. It might be macaroni and cheese, but the noodles would be cooked to the perfect tenderness and the cheese sauce would have no lumps.  If I'm writing macaroni and cheese, I want it to be  good  macaroni and cheese. I suppose that means I just need to go stir the sauce harder, instead of bemoaning the lack of gruyere.

       Brrrrrr   There was frost on the house roofs this morning. This would not be so bad except that, in the interests of saving money, we are attempting to turn the gas furnace off for the year. (So far DOB has managed to turn the gas off, but the instructions are inadequate as to how to get the pilot light to stop burning. It's better than the other way around.)  Also in the interests of saving money on the more common warm days (not to mention the freshening of the air in the back bathroom, which the former owners very imprudently carpeted), we generally have some windows open. Sometimes they don't get shut soon enough.  We did manage to get out of the warm bed soon enough not to have to test whether the savings in energy were offset by the costs of being late to work.  Alas, I don't even have a big pile of dishes to wash while soaking my hands in warm water.

       Doing Our Part  Someone has finally  urlLink run the numbers  on the impact abortion has on electoral politics . . . and the news is bad for liberals. Turns out that people who believe that abortions are good are more likely to have them. And that people who don't reproduce don't pass on their values. The end result is more power to conservatives.  Abortions are quantifiable; unquantifiable but equally significant for this purpose are the numbers of children never even conceived because of an anti-life philosophy. I bet the ideological skewing is similar. Liberals can babble on about "it takes a village" and "children are our future," but the reality is babies aren't made by villages and those who are never born have no future. Bearing and raising children is a task that inherently skews conservative. It is the ultimate form of conservation--passing on the human race.  It's good to know that life still is stronger than death. And that while I change diapers I'm also doing my own small part in saving the country. ;-)

       Ode to Sleep  Yes, somehow, someway, Abbey made it through the night without a single scream. (This is not, of course, the same thing as sleeping through the night, except for Papa. But hey, he doesn't get to nap so it comes out OK.) We're not sure whether it was the change of sleeping location, change of feeding schedule, or simply the result of fervent prayer, but we happily accept it.  She has developed a new trick. She loads up a diaper, then waits for Mama to decide it is time for a change. Carefully she waits for the precise moment when the fresh, clean diaper has just been pinned in place, stares absent-mindedly off into space, as if contemplating the future of Social Security . . . then Whammo!  Then she waits until Mama has changed her again and just sat down and gotten comfortable, and she loads up a third.   Since I only have 12 newborn-sized diapers, I'm having to wash them once a day (and I'm wondering if we'll make it that far today). I'm grateful for two things: 1) I'm using cloth, otherwise I'd see dollar signs ringing before my eyes every time she does this 2) she's not a boy. If she were, I feel certain he would know not to wait until the diaper was on . . .

       Important Diaper Developments  A diaper in Israel saves a baby's life by absorbing  urlLink snake venom .  The critical question not addressed in the story is: disposable or cloth? My guess is cloth, since disposable diaper technology creates ever-trimmer packages, while the layers of cloth necessary for a one-year-old would fend off the fangs of any snake.  Also on the cloth diapering front, the internet is a wonderful thing. Where else are you going to get advice on how to wash your first load of dirty diapers at 3 a.m. when you suddenly realize you are running out? There's always Grandma, of course, but she needs her sleep.

       Gray Hair Check  As if becoming a father wasn't enough of an aging event, DOB received a solicitation for membership from the AARP last week.  It would make sense that they had somehow confused him with his father, but he never issued a general forwarding order from his parents' address. So we can rule that out and just conclude he's turning into an old fogey.  Until he reminds me when my birthday is relative to his . . .

       Drumroll, Please  For all those who have been anxiously waiting, we now have  urlLink pictures .  Many thanks to Aunt Bettie and Uncle Steve for coming by and taking them. Many kudos to Abbey for surviving a bath and a picture taking session with nary a whimper. She made up for it later.

       More 2 a.m. Musings  Abbey (that's how it's spelled, yes we know that's the building) has a strange propensity for screaming from 2 to 4 in the morning. Now we know crying is common in babies, but the precise timing of this had us mystified. Especially since she is otherwise the most incredibly even-tempered baby in the world. (She took a *bath* yesterday without uttering a peep.) She ordinarily sleeps through vaccuuming and puts up with the gaseous troubles of infant life with scarcely a murmur. Yet somehow in the middle of the night the slightest discomfort becomes agony.  So last night we developed a new theory. The only significance we can find to the timing of her discomfort is that it coincides with her birth. She starts getting noisy about 1:30, when I started pushing, and quiets down shortly after 4, when she was born. Perhaps she is suffering from some sort of post-traumatic stress syndrome and having flashbacks.  Now that we have this theory we're not sure what to do with it, but perhaps it will at least serve to console us that we are not doing something horribly wrong.

       Life With Baby   No, we still don't have any pictures. Any kind soul who wants to donate a digital camera to the cause will win the nation's gratitude . . . ;-) We can assure you she is extremely cute. Her head is not smooshed and her skin is not blotchy.  The weirdest thing about being a new parent is the strange obsession you develop with another person's bodily functions. ("Hooray, she's had her designated number of dirty diapers today!")  My mother's preferred lullaby was the words "Bye, oh baby" sung over and over to the tune of "Come, Thou Fount." Ronald used to object to these words as being lame. However, at two a.m., they provide a great relief to a mind unable to process any greater lyrical complexity. At two a.m. it is too difficult to remember what Papa's going to buy you if the looking glass gets broke.

      When I gave the baby permission to wait until Wednesday, I didn't mean he could start labor immediately and  then  wait until Wednesday to actually been born.  I've been having contractions since Friday night. During the night they'll rise almost to go-to-the-hospital levels (which since we're only five minutes from the hospital, is a pretty high level.) And then they'll back off again. But never quite go away.   This is getting very annoying. Also very sleep-depriving.  But one must cope somehow. I'm trying to reset my goals. There's a lady at church who was in labor for two weeks with her oldest. So my new goal is to beat Mary Kappas and labor for  three  weeks.

       Protective Warnings  In other news on the adventures of teenagers, a radio announcement this morning started out with, "Police are warning citizens of the dangers of breaking into pools." The story continued with the tale of some teenagers who had broken into a public pool off-hours, one of whom had dived into the deep end and then, apparently, remembered that he could not swim.  I don't know how much danger there is in breaking into pools, but there is a whole lot of danger in being an idiot. When are they going to start issuing warnings on that?

       Threats to Chickens  Some teenagers were convicted of  urlLink animal cruelty  for beheading chickens, out of curiosity over whether they really would run around 'like chickens with their heads cut off.'  Now, I'm all for punishing them for theft, and cleaning out coops is a good part of it--but reading a book on animal feelings? Does any chicken raiser out there really want to contend that chickens  have  feelings?  They should have been punished by being put on the butchering detail. And then frying the chickens up for dinner. That would have satisfied their curiosity in a hurry.

       Progress  I put all the baby stuff away yesterday; today I must write thank you notes. (My wedding thank you note experience has been sufficient to convince me of the urgency of doing thank you notes immediately, before people move or forget who you are.)  I am also working on a letter to the editor in response to a Howard Dean column in our local paper, in which he complains that the richest, most advanced country in the world doesn't have the universal health care system that even poor countries have. Liberals apparently believe that wealth is distributed randomly over the world, like water, and that all we need is a more equitable irrigation system. Wealth is more like those endangered species they want to protect: it only flourishes under the right circumstances.

       Ignorance is Sub-Blissful  Saturday night we watched the movie  Miracle , about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team. It was a great movie, and I thought as we watched it that my enjoyment of it was not significantly diminished by my total ignorance of hockey. Until we got to the critical game against the Soviets. I saw the tension building up as the US team valiantly overcame the Soviet's lead, but I saw on the scoreboard that there were only three periods and remained calm, figuring, "This is nothing--the really tense period is yet to come."  And then it was all over. And thus I discovered that hockey usually only has three periods, unless the game is tied at the end of the third.   That really is all you need to know about hockey to enjoy the movie. But it would have helped if I had known that much.

       The Key Curse Strikes Again   Only this time it wasn't me who had the key problem. It was the ladies who were unlocking the church for the baby shower on Friday night. The pastor, who was out of town, had given them the key and a tutorial, but due to some key/lock conflict it apparently requires divine assistance to actually turn the lock. The ladies successfully unlocked the deadbolt, but couldn't get the key out--and since the same key was needed to unlock the doorknob, we were stuck. I remarked brightly that at least we weren't having a thunderstorm at the moment, but they told me to be quiet. I began to wonder if we would have a baby shower in the parking lot.  After some loud Baptist prayers, ten or fifteen minutes of fiddling, and the application of a pair of pliers, the key came out. Unfortunately it came out leaving the deadbolt locked. But they were wiser this time. First they unlocked the doorknob, then they unlocked the deadbolt, and they left the key in the deadbolt for anyone who wanted to attempt it while we went inside.  After that the shower proceeded uneventfully, but enjoyably. We got a lot of sleepers and blankets and bibs and similarly useful things. Our favorite is a Snoopy sleeper. The outfit going to the hospital is a striped gown with a coordinating blanket with little animals. (Like you really wanted to know all this.)  Meanwhile, DOB and his dad had been plotting for weeks to spend the evening working on assorted chores involving power tools and moving large items. They misled me by asserting that the boys would come up on Saturday to do these tasks, while Friday night DOB would go down there to watch a pirate movie with them. I was utterly confused when DOB's dad and brothers left the house abruptly just before I left with the female portion of the family for the shower, but was quite thrilled to arrive home and find everything done. Thanks to another brother going to pick up our car on Saturday, that left us with a very enjoyable Saturday to putter around and clean stuff up.

       Profit is Theft  Yesterday's WSJ had an article about grocery stores selling "fair trade" produce, like bananas and coffee beans, where a certain minimum price is guaranteed to the grower. It seems that the wholesale costs for these globally-minded products are generally only slightly above those of normal produce. Yet many grocery stores will mark them up significantly more than they would mark up the normal produce. (One example: bananas for four times the price of regular bananas, sixteen times the price of what the farmers receive.)  I suppose in the scale of evil, exploiting stupid rich Europeans and Americans is less evil than exploiting poor farmers in Costa Rica. But there's a delicious irony in thinking that these folks who think the trade system is inherently evil are unwittingly giving their money to blatant profiteers.   If these folks would think just a little harder they would realize free trade is fair trade--if no one is coerced into the transaction, it's fair. Yes, farming, like every other pursuit, has irreducible risks--sometimes crops are good and prices low; and other times prices are high and crops are bad. The best way for people to be insulated against these risks so that they don't starve in the off years is through rising affluence, which only comes about through freedom. A tight year from poor crop sales is a good sight better than starving from poor crops.

       I knew this would happen   Over the weekend we assembled the baby's bassinette (really the basket off a baby swing), which has previously held seven other Richmond babies. We have it in position beside where I sleep so I can practice not tripping over it at night.   I find myself looking over at it as I pass and wondering, "Hey! Where did I put the baby?" Then I remember that I have not actually given birth yet, and thus cannot possibly have misplaced the baby.

      I was searching the library catalog for a WWII movie about a British war effort to deceive the Nazis, called something along the lines of "The Man That Never Was."  The video was not there, but the list of possible equivalents included the following:  "Man, the measure of all things" "Man, the hopeful primate: The conditions of human evolution." "A man to call my own" "A man to marry"  The first two make for an amusing refutement of secular humanism, but if I weren't already married I would find the last two disconcerting.

       A Call for Male Leadership in the Church   Yesterday DOB and I were driving to church and found ourselves behind a woman in an SUV. She was driving too fast to pass. She was also applying eye makeup for several miles. This made us nervous and relieved when she finally pulled off at a gas station.  Perhaps we are extrapolating too much, but it seemed likely to us that she was driving to church--where else in the countryside merits eye makeup at 9:30 on a Sunday morning? (I suppose she could work at the gas station, but I find it hard to believe that such wages could support a brand new SUV.)  Now, if a man had only been taking her to church, the road would have been a safer place. She could have applied her eye makeup without endangering the rest of us. If men won't go to church for other reasons, we must appeal to them to go for road safety.  (What about the possibility that there was no man in her life? Ah, but if there were more good Christian guys out there, she wouldn't have that problem . . . )

       Tort Reform  One subject Stossel touched on last night was the evils engendered by trial lawyers, a topic always near and dear to the hearts even of non-trial lawyers like us.   The problem is how to reform the problems with the tort system without making matters worse by further government tampering. Of course, the tort system uses the power of government to enforce its results, but it has a certain market element which ought to be maximized. If it were properly run, it would be a much better means of regulation of dangerous activity than alphabet soup agencies.  But few people besides trial lawyers would argue that it is properly run today. I won't bother to repeat the litany of complaints, but will plunge in to analyzing proposed fixes.  First, a framework. The goal of the tort system should be justice. In an ideal scenario, the injured party recovers from the guilty party a sum corresponding to the amount of his damage. The guilty party is punished in proportion to his culpability--but no more. The tort system should be set up to seek this result.   Unfortunately, it seems that the current tort system is set up to seek the result that the "injured" (or not) party recover as much as the "guilty" (or not) party can afford to pay.  Now to proposed fixes:    Loser Pays :  If a person brings a lawsuit that fails, they must pay the costs of the party they sued. This has a lot going for it. Right now, the tort system works rather like a gambler being given someone else's credit card in a casino. They might not win, but they really haven't got much to lose. This distorts incentives for bringing a suit. A true free market in lawsuits would provide consequences for bad choices in lawsuits as well as rewards for good ones. "Loser pays" would do this.   Theoretically "loser pays" could dissuade some legitimate plaintiffs from bringing suits that they would have a hard time proving; but it would prevent the much more widespread evil of innocent defendants being compelled to pay up rather than face the costs of a hollow victory after a drawn-out lawsuit.   It's also the rule in every other country. And it seems analogous to the rule about false witnesses in the Bible: If you bear false witness against someone else, you suffer the punishment you would have brought upon them.    Capping Damages  : If actual damages are proven, they should be paid, no matter how high they are. That is part of recompensing the innocent and punishing the guilty. Arbitrary caps on nebulous items like pain and suffering might be less problematic, since you cannot put a monetary value on those anyway.  But capping punitive damages is less important than seeing that they are used only in appropriate cases. Punitive damages are supposed to be used only when evil conduct is shown. They should never be used for mere negligence. Nor should they be used except for personal injuries; for economic injuries, compensation is enough.    Abolishing Joint and Several Liability:   Joint and several liability means that if four people caused you damage, and you only sue one of them (who was at most 10% at fault), you can recover 100% of your damages from them. They then have the possibility of recovering the rest of those damages from the other culpable parties, but in reality probably won't because whatever considerations kept you from suing the others (they don't have any money or aren't easily subject to suit) will probably keep the defendant from recovering, too.  Here the two objectives of justice come into conflict. We can either ensure full compensation of the victim, or punish the guilty party only in proportion to his fault, but not both. In my opinion (I think DOB still differs with me on this) the latter goal is more important. Life sometimes prevents us from recovering all that justice might demand. But if we force a party to pay damages of which he is not guilty, we have used our legal system to perpetuate a second injustice. And remember that these "evil corporations" that are always being held liable because they have the money are employers and producers of goods--damage to them creates damage to countless others. If they deserve to be put out of business because of their malfeasance, fine. But businesses should not be punished merely because they have money and are easy to sue.  This all reminds me of the story of an American lawyer who was guest teaching a class in an Italian law school. At the end, a group of students approached him and one asked, "Is it true that in America if you fall down on the sidewalk you can sue and win a lot of money?" The American replied that it was. The students began talking excitedly in Italian. The American asked, "What--do you all want to go to America to be lawyers now?" "No," replied the spokesman, "We want to go to America and fall down on sidewalks!"

       I Blocked John Stossel's Limo  Last night we drove up to Columbus to a very elegant event celebrating the Buckeye Institute's 10th anniversary. John Stossel spoke (not Jim Tressel, a football coach, which was what DOB thought I had said).   DOB gave me the task of picking where to sit, which is always a delicate task in a crowd. The temptation is to either find a place with someone you know and sit by them (in which case you never meet anybody new) or to pick a place at an empty table and see who comes (but if the room is already mostly full, chances are good you'll be stuck by yourselves). I picked a half-way full table as near the middle of the room as we could get without getting into the tables reserved for groups.  It turned out that the gentleman whom DOB sat next to was someone whom he had worked on an opposing campaign from nearly a decade ago. And who lives just a short distance from where he works now. Soon they were swapping political critiques and tales like old cronies.   Stossel's speech was good (thoughts thereby inspired in a later post), and dinner was good, but we did not win the giveaway of a chartered flight for eight to Atlantic City. Oh well.  DOB was trying walking with a cane for the first time since the latest injury. We were pleased with it overall--it looked more distinguished than crutches and nobody blamed me for beating up on him. However, it made walking slower and more painstaking than with crutches, and we accidentally parked on a relatively distant side of the hotel. Plus, the hotel driveway was paved in bricks, which looked elegant but were awkward to walk on.  So when we made it to the front door, I volunteered to get the car while he finished up a conversation. As I brought the car around, I realized that John Stossel and the Buckeye dignitaries were loading into a limo on the left side of the drive. I pulled up as far to the right as I could and got out so DOB could drive, leaving the car running and, in an instinctive effort to avoid locking the keys in the car, the driver's door open.   DOB was still talking and I watched and realized, too late, that the car door was blocking the middle space in the drive, which the limo would have to get through to get around another limo in front of it. One of the valets came along and held the door almost closed so that the limo could squeeze through.   John Stossel was whisked back to ABC to continue his noble work, and I did not lock the keys in a running car. All was well.

       Return of the Disposal Monster  Longtime visitors to this blog may recall we had garbage disposal  urlLink troubles  at our old apartment. Therefore I approached the one at the house with great tentativeness, only throwing down small, easily digested items.  It handled these with grace and ease. Over time, I became more daring. Ultimately, overconfident. Yesterday I tried to have it consume several orange peels and two cauliflower cores simultaneously. It proved too much. Although it continues whirling around, spewing fine bits of food into the sink, the water will not go down.  Fortunately nothing has rotted yet, so the house just smells like I've been making several gallons of coleslaw. But the future does not look bright. DOB wants to remove the garbage disposal altogether so that the temptation is gone.  I want a compost pile. Curse these over-manicured neighborhoods.

       Hand Signals   I had already waved farewell to DOB in the garage this morning and returned to the office to opened the drape, as is my custom. I noticed he was only as far as the driveway, waving and gesturing to me. It looked kind of like the odd gestures he makes at his brothers when they stand at the windows and watch him leave, so I made some back. Instead of driving off, he continued to gesture, more and more wildly.  Finally I realized there seemed to be some significance to the gestures. I ran out the front door. He rolled down the window.  "You look cute making those gestures," he said, "But I need my glasses."   That explained the ring-around-the-eyes gesture he had kept repeating.  At least this morning I remembered to remind him to comb his hair. It's hard to keep track of everything at this hour of the day.

       The Time is . . . Near   According to the doctor, today I am officially at full term (37 weeks) and may proceed to have a baby any time I feel like it. And I *still* don't have things ready, although Kristen was here all day yesterday filling our freezer with baked goodies.  One of the pregnancy magazines in the doctor's offices had a feature on the dreams pregnant women have. Apparently at this stage women often dream of things like deep water that signify surrendering to labor.   I haven't had any dreams about deep water, but I did dream last night about having the baby. It all happened so fast that we were out in the parking lot, heading home, before we remembered to check the gender of the baby. (It was a girl.) There was also a great crowd of people when we went back into the hospital to check out properly, including most of my friends and relations. In the crush, my youngest brother bumped into me and refused to admit it. So I punched him and sent him sprawling.  I'm not sure what significance a dream like that has. Considering that my youngest brother is six feet tall and over 200 pounds, maybe it signifies aggrandized visions of my own strength to help me make it through labor. I'm not sure where this latent hostility is coming from, though.

       Just in case you wanted to know   "Hola! Mi nombre se Inigo Montoya. Mataste a mi padre. Preparate a morir."  Annoyingly enough, the Spanish voiceover and the Spanish subtitles are slightly different. This is the voiceover version, which sounded cooler. Except for the greeting he gives at the beginning, which I don't know and can't find, so I had to stick with "Hola!"

       Expecting June   DOB's eldest younger brother still goes to his family's former church in Cincinnati, while the rest of the family has joined us closer to home. Yesterday we were enjoying the family Memorial Day picnic when the following conversation occurred:  Brother: Folks at church are wondering when June will arrive.  DOB (puzzled): It's tomorrow.  Brother: Karen's due tomorrow?  DOB: No, tomorrow is the first of June. That's when June arrives, on the first.  Brother: I didn't ask when *June* arrives, I asked when *Junior* arrives.

       Pyramid Schemes  The Wall Street Journal yesterday covered the conflict over the USDA's impending adoption of a revised food recommendation chart. (They might even ditch the pyramid. Perhaps they hope to adopt a more eye-catching model shape, such as the Venus de Milo.)  Like any other government process, it is attracting hordes of lobbyists for the various food industries, all vying to proclaim their product as essential for good health. The Atkins people want a bigger chunk for protein; the Harvard people want more emphasis on whole grains. The white flour folks are suffering, as are the potato farmers. (I'll speak a word for potatoes, if no one else will. They're cheap, they taste good, and if you mash them with butter and milk and serve them with roast beef, as God intended, they won't spike your blood sugar. But no doubt the Potato Caucus will see their place is protected.)  So while the bureaucrats are hearing from the Low-Carb People, the High-Carb People, the Potato People, the Squash People, and the Styrofoam-With-Sugar-and-Artificial-Flavors people, one has to wonder: Just who thought the government could do a better job at this, anyway? Do we really think the final result will be some all-wise pronouncement from on high on the best nutritional actions? (If so, consider the critique of the Harvard People: "wishy-washy, scientifically unfounded advice" that contributes to "overweight, poor health and unnecessary early death.")  The truth is, the government doesn't know more about nutrition than any other particular guru. And why do we need tax dollars to pay for one more voice in the clamor?

       Major Offense  I burnt the carrots the other night. It seems that, in the Duchy, this should be tantamount to high treason.  Actually it is merely a symptom of a deeper problem, namely: my lack of a mid-sized saucepan with a lid that fits. Instead I use a very small saucepan and balance a plate over the top, which stops the steam from escaping only to condense it and run it down the edges of the plate and all over the stove, while the pot rapidly boils dry. (Note to self: try putting the plate on right side up instead of upside down, so it doesn't curve down.)  One of these days I'll get a proper set of pans, and work out more storage space in the kitchen, and install a reverse osmosis water system, and solve all the hundred and one other minor difficulties that keep the house from running as smoothly as I would like. And the Ducklings will grow up thinking that is just the way things are and not until they marry will they discover what a long and arduous process setting up housekeeping is.

       Cost of Living  Does it really  urlLink cost  that much to have a baby? Of course not. It's sort of like weddings. If your goal is to get married, it's cheap. If your goal is to outdo and impress your friends, it's expensive.  Just look at the things in this article that few, if any, people need:   Breast pump, bottles, etc: just take the baby with you. This also saves on babysitter costs.   Baby classes: that's crazy. If you want to expose your baby to Mozart, switch on the radio. If you're really concerned about brain development, you can get all the ideas you could want for free from the library and Internet.  Picture taking and distributing equipment: OK, we may be a bit derelict in this department. We are going to get a digital camera one of these days, really we are. And we don't have the expense for everything else needed to distribute them because we already have it. So I can't be too critical here.  Books at $20 apiece: Thanks to aunts who know how to shop thrift stores, we have a good, low-cost collection. We also have several library cards.  New car: huh?  First birthday party: Give the kid some paper to crinkle up, cake to smash in his face, and adults acting like lunatics to watch, and he'll be happy.   Babies are the craziest thing to spend a lot of money on, because a) they have no idea you're doing it and couldn't care less as long as they get fed, and b) there is so much perfectly good baby stuff out there for next to nothing, because of all the people out there who  are  spending thousands of dollars on stuff for their kids--and then they only have two, so it's still in great condition when they're done with it.  Time to hit the garage sales again.

       Very Bad Advice  A  urlLink test-prep company  is planning to do formal testing to find out exactly what minor activities (choice of food, clothing worn, etc.) might boost scores a few points on tests like the SAT.  This is all well and good, but the conventional advice on the side contains one very erroneous piece of advice: avoid candy.  Right before I took the bar exam, I was told on good authority that the secret to passing&nbsp;was consuming sufficient chocolate. Though not customarily much of a candy-eater, I procured a bag of chocolate. (I did not steal it. Or, of course, pay for it.&nbsp;Someone had leftover Christmas candy, I think.) I dutifully consumed chocolate at each break. And I passed. Now, how can you argue with that?

       Following the Democratic Convention Closely . . .   Via  urlLink Dave Barry , of course:  "The convention continues tonight, with the theme being: ''Making America Stronger through the Strength of Strongness.'' The idea here is to convince doubtful voters that the Democrats can be trusted to be tough on terrorism and won't create some kind of feel-good liberal bleeding-heart program like enrolling terrorists in bowling leagues.  Emphasis on this theme will continue through Thursday night, when, to climax the convention, an actual live terrorist will be released onstage, and John Kerry will beat him senseless with a hockey stick, after which John Edwards will sue him."

       The Real Difficulty  I have been reading what is probably far too much on the merits of scheduling babies or not. I try to follow a perfect balance. (Translation: I do things the way that suits me.) Abbey is generally quite happy eating every three hours or so, but will go longer at night, and I don't have a problem if some days she decides she needs to eat more often. Some days  I  need to eat more often, so why shouldn't she?  The main things I would like to establish is going to bed at the same time (however many times we eat thereafter) and getting up at the same time every day, and not being awake between nighttime feedings. We are doing pretty well, except that she seems to prefer sleeping from 7 to 9 p.m., and then waking between 9 and 11. Tonight we are working on staying awake until 9.  Any schedule I might try to implement, however, has a fatal weak point. Me. If  I  don't wake up at a certain time, she won't either. (Unless, of course, she happens to be hungry.) One cannot schedule a baby more than one is scheduled one's self. So what do the schedule people do about  that ?

Unfortunately, I haven't had this all along, and I don't want to lose my former comments. So it looks to me as if I will have to have two comment possibilities from now to the end of time. Is it worth it? Or does anybody know how I can change this short of re-entering all the comments myself?

       Non Sequitur of the Day  The following paragraph appeared in a letter to the editor in our local paper:  "In 1663 a Bible was translated for a Massachusetts Indian tribe and shortly after that the Puritans killed the Indians. Then came the witch trials and years of religious bigotry."  Apparently it's translating the Bible that creates the urge to kill people. Hey, that would cover all the wars in Europe since the Reformation! We would all be better off if the Bible had stayed in Latin.  The rest of the letter makes about as much sense.

       A Modest Proposal   urlLink This  is a lengthy but worthwhile article on the current state of family law. Many good points on the problems with the current no-fault divorce&nbsp;system. Where else in life can the one who breaches a contract still go to court with no prejudice against them and ask for all the benefits from the contract? Why on earth have such a crazy system for the most important agreement in life? (The article proposes one answer: the more divorces there are, the more divorce lawyers and courts and social workers there are.)  No-fault divorce was sold because people shouldn't be "forced" to remain married. But it's no&nbsp; more fair to force them to get divorced. At least the marriage they voluntarily chose at some point.  The fad for "covenant marriage" laws seems to have passed. But I see no reason why people shouldn't accept a simple, fair proposal with no religious trappings: treat marriage like any other contract. If two parties both want to rescind the contract, they can do so on whatever terms they want. But otherwise, the one who breaches the contract can claim no benefits under it and may be liable for damages.  How would this work in real life? There would basically be three potential divorce scenarios:  1. Both parties want to get divorced. They would draw up their own divorcing contract, negotiate between themselves who gets the kids, the house, etc. The court would then certify and enforce this contract, freely negotiated between the parties.  2. One party breaches the marriage contract in some way other than filing for divorce. (The classic grounds for fault: adultery, abuse, abandonment.) The other party can, if he or she wishes, file for divorce by establishing one of those grounds for fault. If they establish it, they are presumptively entitled to the children, the house, child support, etc., since they were injured by the breach of the marriage contract. (The other party can of course keep their own personal belongings and may have an equity claim to some portion of the marital property, as would be the case under any other contract.)  Some would say that this puts us back to the bad old days of evil, acrimonious divorces where everyone's dirty laundry is aired. Yes, and we're so far from that now. Does the name Jack Ryan ring a bell? Especially when children are involved, all that dirty laundry is going to be aired anyway, even if it has to be soiled for the purpose at hand.  3. One party wants a divorce but the other does not, and no fault is shown. In that case, the party who wants a divorce gets one--but that's all they get. In fact, they may be liable for damages (alimony, child support, etc.), to the extent the other party can prove them.   Now, there's nothing religious about that treatment of marriage and divorce--just simple, straightforward contract law. Who could object? And it would result in a nosedive in the divorce rate, as people discovered it wasn't worth the cost to go off and "find themselves."   And on the side, it might dampen the push for&nbsp;same-sex marriage. If marriage really was marriage, would they want it?

       Turning into a Jewish mother  I have a new ambition for my children. I want one of them to be a scientist. (In fairness to them, I won't be particular as to which one. Of course, I only have one so far.)  I have always had an interest in science, including two first-prize winning exhibits at the State Science Fair in grade school. And I grew up in a family that heavily emphasized the creation/evolution debate. I think we owned every book the Institute for Creation Research and Answers in Genesis ever published. There's even a book on science in my current reading stack.  But I bet anything I might attempt to say on scientific matters would sound to anyone with any scientific training like people who've watched two videos on the topic sound to me when they start discoursing on the Constitution. Those who look down their noses at the scientific knowledge and interest of the evangelical community at large may be arrogant jerks, but they do have a point. There's a great deal of room for improvement.  I don't like just having vague ideas about things . . . I want to  know . And if I can't know, I'd like to be related to someone who did.  Thus my real motivation for having children is evidenced. I have too many things that I'm interested in and must make more people and warp their minds so they will go out and do them for me.   &nbsp;

       Requiem for Brain Cells   Shortly after noon I turned on the oven to heat lunch. About one I told my sister, "We should go eat--I'm sure the food is hot by now." I went into the kitchen, opened the oven, and remarked, "I'm sure the food would be hot by now  if  it had been in the oven instead of in the refrigerator." It worked just as well as she was then able to reach her goal of finishing the crib skirt before lunch. (The nursery looks quite charming thanks to her work. Now we just need a sunflowery quilted hanging on the wall over the crib.)  A little bit later I noticed Abbey was soaking through all cloth in the vicinity, and realized I had completely forgotten to change her at her last feeding--two hours earlier.   I tried taking a nap this afternoon to recharge my brain cells. I'm not sure how much it accomplished.  But I probably needed it. Because I&nbsp;am trying to resolve an anomaly in Abbey's schedule. She was quite happily functioning on a three-hour feeding cycle, with the ability to stretch longer during the night. Somehow this longer stretch at night always threw the schedule off enough that this longer stretch would only put us down to one feeding every other night, and on the alternate nights, she would wake up hungry at 3 a.m., giving me just enough time to feed her, get her back to sleep, and drift off to sleep myself before the alarm would go off at 4:30 and I'd have to get up to feed DOB and get him off to work. I found it very difficult to arise under these circumstances.   So my theory was that if I fed Abbey every night about 9 or 9:30, she would sleep until 1 or so, then I could feed her, and she'd sleep to 4:30 and all would be well. So tonight I woke her up at 9 and fed her. As custom for her last evening feeding dictated, I sang her a few songs and put her in bed. Her eyes were wide open. She cried. And kept crying. Intermittently for the next two and a half hours. She's not crying now because I'm feeding her. But what is up with her? Did someone bring her a latte?  And tomorrow, how do I stay awake enough to keep her awake to keep this from repeating?

       Top Five     &nbsp;  Last night we (my sister is still visiting) got talking about meeting famous people and came to the conclusion it seemed pointless to wait a long time in line merely to shake hands with anyone. Given the opportunity to actually sit down and talk with them, however, we all had plenty of famous people we'd like to meet.  &nbsp;  So the challenge is: list the top five living, more-or-less famous&nbsp;people you'd like the opportunity to have a prolonged conversation with (or if the thought of talking to them is too intimidating, to be part of a conversation they were having with someone capable of intelligent dialogue with them).  &nbsp;  Here are our lists:  &nbsp;  QOC:  1. Justice Scalia  2. Thomas Sowell  3. J. Budziszewski  4. Paul Johnson  5. Mike Antonnucci  &nbsp;  DOB:  1. William F. Buckley  2. Robert Novak  3. Chief Justice Rehnquist  4. Thomas Sowell  5. Jesse Helms  &nbsp;  DOB then made a second list, in no particular order:  Mel Gibson  Margaret Thatcher  President Bush  Curt Schilling  Haley Barbour  &nbsp;  Becky didn't finish her living people list, but so far she has:  1. Elisabeth Elliot  2. Ben Rich (The guy in charge of Skunkworks, the stealth plane project)  3. Whoever runs the logistics at the White House  &nbsp;  Then we decided to come up with a dead people list, too.  QOC:  1. G. K. Chesterton  2. C. S. Lewis  3. Winston Churchill  4. Deborah (from Judges)  5. Jane Austen  &nbsp;  DOB:  1. Abraham Lincoln  2. John Adams  3. Senator Robert A Taft  4. John Bunyan  5. David  &nbsp;  Becky:  1. Hudson Taylor  2. Winston Churchill  3. Ernest Shakleton  4. Joseph  5. Jonathan Edwards  &nbsp;  Clearly DOB favors politicians, Becky favors people who run things, and I favor writers. Although it seems redundant to want to talk to a writer, since one already has their books.  &nbsp;  Anybody want to post their own list?

        Summertime    Last night we stopped at a farm and bought fresh sweet corn. I sat on the back steps and shucked it. We had it with chicken pasta salad, coleslaw, and apple waffles. (My visiting&nbsp;sister reminded me of this trick for when one doesn't have the time or right pans to make muffins.) I felt like a kid again, probably too much so as DOB had to remind me that we do in fact have air conditioning and can't just leave doors open at random to increase the feeling of fellowship while shucking corn.    &nbsp;  The only thing missing was a picnic table to eat at under the prickle ball tree.

       Flashbacks   One of my former law school classmates had an essay of his chosen as a model answer by the New Jersey Bar. It's been nearly three years since I last took a bar exam. It's been almost two years since I thought about bar exams. (DOB took his bar in July 2002.) And yet, somehow, just reading the first few lines brought it all back. "Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought . . . "  Both bar exams stand out vividly amid the mush of memories of 2000 and 2001. I guess traumatic experiences have a way of doing that.

       Gotta Dance   The New York Times today covers the efforts of  urlLink same-sex couples  to be allowed into competitive ballroom dancing.  It may seem a bit trivial to make a fuss about the symbol when the substance is so far under attack. But symbols are important, at times of more immediate importance than reality. They provide a lens to understand the reality.  Ballroom dancing, as Henry Tilney pointed out in  Northanger Abbey  is, and always has been, a symbol of marriage. It is the exclusive union of one man and one woman for a mutual purpose. It beautifully illustrates the complementary nature of marriage: Men lead and women follow, not because men are generally better dancers, but because someone must lead and within the parameters of the dance it makes sense for the man to do so.   Submission in the dance does not lead to the man trampling the woman, but empowering her to do things the man could never do, and she could not do alone. It brings to mind that old line, "Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did--only backwards and in high heels" that beautifully illustrates the strength and grace of the traditional woman's role.   (Can a Baptist speak so warmly about ballroom dancing? But after all, any Baptist objection to it is based on the grounds that it provides such an excellent symbol of marriage that it ought not to be engaged in promiscuously. So the analogy holds.)  Even those promoting same-sex ballroom dancing acknowledge that it's a different art form than opposite-sex ballroom dancing. A man can't move the way a woman does. The leader-follower relationship must be changed. And even the emotional dynamic of the relationship symbolized influences the dance. Two men dancing is not the same thing as a man and a woman dancing. And thus the symbol draws us back to the reality.  I'm reminded of C.S. Lewis using the analogy (and another Jane Austen insight) of a ballroom dance in analyzing why women should not be ordained in the church. He argues that, on the fringes, one can treat men and women as interchangeable--that at a factory  or at a ballot-box their sex indeed does not matter. But the closer you get to the center, to the realities at the heart of the universe, the more important the distinction becomes.   Ballroom dancing is the symbol of a symbol. Marriage and the church hierarchies are symbols of the reality. I doubt we will fully grasp the reality symbolized until we look into the face of our Father (not Mother or Parent) in heaven. But it has something to do with otherness. The delight of one person in another like himself could be merely narcisstic. Sex shows us the potential for delight in someone different; indeed, that part of the delight is the very differentness. Equating a same-sex relationship with an opposite-sex relationship hides the reality that God planted within human beings when he made them male and female: that although He is not like us, yet He desires us.

       Baby Book Update  OK, this is not supposed to have happened yet. Last night I left Abbey lying on her tummy on the bed while I quickly went in the other room to get ready for bed. She was in a state where she was not pleased with the world, no matter what position she was in, but the tummy is supposed to be more calming. Instead she just cried and flailed her arms and legs.  Then I heard DOB saying, "You can't do that anymore." I came back in and sure enough, she had flipped herself over on her back, perilously close to the edge. She was still crying just as hard.  She's not supposed to be doing this for two or three more months. Maybe it doesn't count because it was an accident.   And now how am I going to park her when I need to run do something?

       Menu Mysteries   Why is it that telephone menus always offer you the final option of "For all other inquiries, press '0' or stay on the line and your call will be answered in the order it was received"?  Does pressing '0' somehow nudge you up in the lottery of phone menudom? Or is it just there to satisfy compulsive control freaks who have a need to feel like they are doing  something ?

       What's In a Name?  So now it turns out McCain-Feingold might prohibit  urlLink car dealerships  from advertising before the election. That is, car dealerships founded by a candidate who is running in that election. Ironically, the seat targeted is none other than that of Senator Feingold himself.  Mr. Darrow doesn't even seem to run the dealerships anymore--CEO is his son, of the same name. So isn't it arguable the name doesn't refer to him, but to his son? And if that's not permitted what's next: suppose a candidate happens to have the same name as a notable business, but no actual connection to it--will the business have to take their ads off the air?  At least Feingold's campaign doesn't seem to want to make an issue of it. But the Common Cause fellow still thinks that name recognition is inherently evil. So I have to ask: What about Senator Feingold's name ID? (Which is being spread even by tales of his opponent's legal quandries.) Isn't that an unfair advantage? Perhaps we should require incumbents to change their names every election cycle so that everyone runs on issues alone.

       Baby Blues   All right, I concede, DOB was right. If you dress a baby in blue, no matter how gender-neutral the decorations, everyone will think she's a boy. Next time we go out I will have to dredge up something vaguely feminine.  I still think it's wrong. Who says girls don't wear blue? I have a sister who rarely wears any other color. (Of course, at 19, she has other indicators of her gender than color-coding.)

       Technological Advances  Even in pre-parenthood days, I could not help but notice that the primary selling point for any particular brand of disposable diapers was how their latest advances helped keep baby comfy and dry.  Today I received a Pampers ad extolling a new line of products for toilet training with an exciting new feature: they stay  wet  so that baby will be  uncomfortable  (and hie him to the potty chair next time).

       Online Identities  We have been referring to Abbey by her real live name long enough. Obviously if DOB and I have online identies (actually a whole host of them, but only one each for purposes of this blog), she should, too.  The question is, what? I am inclined toward picking a title that can apply to all future offspring, with the addition of a number. Two ideas that come to mind:  Hobbit (H1, H2, etc.): She's short, cute, and likes to eat six meals a day (and two a night). She also has big feet, but they are not hairy.  Duckling (D1, D2, etc.): It just seems logical to me that the inhabitant of a duchy should be a duckling.   Any thoughts?

       NPR Covers the Kerry Campaign   Since Abbey likes classical music, I turned on the radio (she started bobbing her head up and down in time with Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2). But then the news came on with the following report on the Johns first joint campaign stop, today in Cleveland, Ohio.  John E: "The American people are going to reject the negative campaign tactics of the past and embrace hope and opportunity, because this is America!!!"  Reporter: John Kerry then attacked President Bush for high gasoline prices.  John K: "The days are over when we put a single young American in harm's way over foreign oil."  Apparently the irony was wasted on the reporter.

       The Fifth of July   DOB's family celebrated Independence Day yesterday. DOB and his brothers staged a brief play which seemed to be about the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's ride, and the Battle of Lexington. It was short on scripted dialogue and long on cardboard box throwing and air gun firing. I got to light the lanterns in the belfry (flashlights behind the refrigerator).   Afterward they experimented and discovered that all six of them could, in fact, fit inside a dryer box.   The reason they had a dryer box is because our old dryer (inherited from DOB's parents and nearly as old as he is) started shooting sparks on Saturday. Providentially, DOB's dad and brother were standing in the utility at the time, working on drains and such. (The drains work great now, btw.) So the house did not burn down, and since it was Saturday DOB could drive right down to the appliance store where we bought the washing machine, held out the manual and said, "Get me the one that matches this." He was out the door with our new dryer in five minutes. And now we have a matched set, even! With the current diaper situation, going even one day without a dryer was not an option.

       The Fourth of July  Traditions are the sauce in which a medley of years blends together into a single dish called the "Fourth of July."  Traditions string every Fourth from infancy to last year into one grand meld of sand and green water, fried chicken and orange bowknot rolls, relatives I don't know and those I do, squealing bottle rockets and Uncle Walt's harmonica that still lingers over the festivities though he's been gone for a decade. I still have my blue checked jumper and red t-shirt that matches the rest of the family.   Indeed, it is the Fourth's that weren't spent at Aunt Winnie's that stick out in my mind. The year we were waiting for Sarah to be born (she wasn't born for another week, but one of our cows had a calf that day, which we named Uncle Sam and revised to Aunt Samantha when we got a closer look). The year Dad had to work and we watched my weird aunt's friends come close to lighting Grandpa's field on fire. The year I spent most of the day in a hotel room in North Carolina, wishing DOB was online. (I did go to a quite enjoyable party that evening, where I learned several hilarious equipment-free games and that yellow squash makes a terrible pie.)  Last year was the pinnacle of Fourth of July celebrations. DOB came out on one of his rare visits before the wedding. The day was perfectly warm, dry, and sunny. (Generally in Washington summer weather arrives on the Fifth of July.) A musician was playing celtic harp on the ferry up to Whidbey Island. We rowed around the lagoon and got ourselves marooned on a floating dock until some distant cousins came to the rescue. The food was all as it should be, though we almost missed the homemade chicken and got stuck with the stuff somebody picked up at the deli. In the evening we went down to camp to watch several kids under slight supervision by the camp director and my brother (who are technically too old to be kids) set off fireworks wildly in all directions. We narrowly escaped being struck by an errant explosive--instead it hit the camp director in the seat of the pants, to the delight of all.  But this year all that was very far away. We made it to church with Abbey for the first time (though just for the potluck and afternoon service). I couldn't find anything patriotic that fit and seemed suitable for nursing. (Abbey wore her Fourth of July outfit, though.) The potluck was good, but nobody knows how to make orange bowknot rolls out here. We were too tired (well, Abbey and I were) when we got home to go to the band concert or fireworks display in town. So we went to bed. After Abbey went down we tried singing some patriotic songs and that helped, but it still didn't feel much like the Fourth.  Over the next few years no doubt we'll blend our own sauce of traditions that Abbey will look back on and think, "But if we don't do ________________ it won't feel like the Fourth of July!"

       Rising Temperatures  It's being alleged that ads for "Farenheit 9/11" might  urlLink run afoul  of campaign finance law. It is not an absurd interpretation of the law--it shows the absurdity of the law itself. If you can't run ads saying "Bush is evil," you can't run ads saying, "Come watch our movie about Bush being evil." Is this an infringement on free speech? You bet.  Somebody--maybe Gephardt, I forget--commented during the adoption of the campaign finance law that we couldn't have both free speech and fair political campaigns. True indeed. Freedom is never fair. It just so happens under the Constitution of our country that freedom is protected, not some abstract "fairness" standard where every campaign is equally funded and has equally clever ads.  It's possible Moore will get a free ride by being part of the media, which further underscores the problems with this law. Since when did the media have a greater right to free speech than the rest of us? What does one have to do to get in the protected "media" class? And if the government decides who the "press" is, how much freedom of the press do we really have?  Upholding the campaign finance law has to have been one of the stupidest and most dangerous SCOTUS precedents of recent years. There's a reason the First Amendment is First--free political speech is our first line of defense against every other abuse government might deploy. Unfortunately under current First Amendment law, political speech, the bastion of a free nation, is less protected than erotic dancing, whose benefit to society is only slightly less dubious than its relevance to "free speech" at all.  On an only slightly related note, is it just me or is "Farenheit 9/11" a really dumb title? I assume it's a takeoff on "Farenheit 451" (which I haven't read but my sister says it's good), which made sense: the temperature at which paper burns as the title for a book about bookburning. But what kind of temperature is 9/11? .8182 degrees?

       Midnight Screaming in Perspective   We received an email this morning from one of the other couples in our birthing class. Their little boy was born a day after Abbey . . . and has been in NICU ever since, due to meconium inhalation and pulmonary problems. They're looking forward to bringing him home this weekend.  I can put up with any amount of screaming to have my baby here with me.  She didn't scream at midnight last night, although she did have quite a fussy session this morning while she was supposed to be blissfully sleeping so we could get DOB off to work.

       The Duke Returneth  DOB has finally found a way to work blogging into his schedule. So go  urlLink check it out . This has been precipitated by the discovery of Blogger's email posting function, so that he can simply email the text he wants to the site. For some reason this makes him feel that it is easier to post, although I have trouble understanding why, since the email posting function always messes up the formatting and he winds up having to tinker with it via the regular posting format anyway. But whatever works, I guess.

       Once Upon a Midnight Dreary . . .   After giving us two nights of sleep, Abbey is awake again. Not screaming, but I have taken her out of the bedroom just in case so that DOB can get his sleep. My theory is that it's just too hot. I have her in a very fuzzy sleeper because she has wet almost everything else, and I just discovered the A/C had been turned up to 78. So I have turned it back down and am waiting for coolness to ensue.  In other household news, the slow-moving drain situation has reached crisis proportions. I pulled a  growing bean plant  out of the bathroom sink plug yesterday. Nasty.

       Too Much Thyme On My Hands  Last night I was making dinner. I grabbed the marjoram, noticed it had a cover for shaking, and gave it a few shakes over the dish. I grabbed the thyme, gave it a few shakes over the dish, and noticed it did  not  have a cover for shaking. Sometimes I think my spice cupboard is deliberately set up to entrap me. I retrieved what I could and scraped the rest off and threw it away. It was a terrible waste of thyme.

       Sherlock Holmes and the Drug War  A combination conspicuous for its absence. The crimes Sherlock Holmes unravels pertain to theft and murder, motivated by the usual assortment of human passions. Drugs are present neither as a crime themselves, nor as motives for other crimes.  (At least to my recollection, but it's been awhile since I read through all the stories. DOB and I are reading through them at the rate of about one a month, so it will take me awhile before I have a more definitive thought on this.)  To be sure, literature is not criminal statistics, but nothing conveys the mores and social realities of a time better than its literature.  Sherlock Holmes  is meant to be sensational--to tell the tales of the dregs of society. So it ought to be an excellent place to look to see how drugs influenced Victorian England.  Drugs were readily and legally available at the time. Opium dens operated; Holmes himself shoots cocaine from time to time when the casework gets slow. It's not evident from  Sherlock Holmes , but opium and cocaine were commonly used in patent medicines.  And the dangers of drugs were known. Watson lectures Holmes from time to time on his cocaine use, rather as a doctor might today lecture a patient on smoking. In one story, Watson must go to an opium den to retrieve a friend who is tragically addicted, much to the grief of his friends and family.  But drugs still are not perceived as a societal problem per se. Certainly they sometimes cause problems for individuals, but even there the drug of choice for home-destruction is alcohol. (As it has been since Noah planted a vineyard and will be until the cup is passed in the New Jerusalem.) Because drugs are legal, they do not attract the attention of organized crime. Imagine what Professor Moriaty could do if he also headed up a drug cartel.  In short, the record of Victorian England gives us historical precedent that the legalization of drugs not only means no need to prosecute people for having drugs, but also gets rid of crimes committed over drugs--and without an increase in drug abusers. Then today's police, like Sherlock Holmes, could focus on thieves and murderers and let the mere addicts alone.

       New Income Source  The Wall Street Journal had a consumer review of various plain white T-shirts, which apparently are the latest rage. The one that received the poorest quality rating was also one of the most expensive, at over $40. But this was not that odd, considering that the fashion company's stated goal is to create a T-shirt that feels like it's been worn for 12 or 13 years.  Instead of cutting up DOB's remaining premarital T-shirts for rags, I clearly should be selling them. I wonder if armpit holes are now a hot fashion item?

       First Lessons  Last night we were sitting down for family devotions. DOB, noticing he had D1's rapt attention (or seemed to), pointed to the book in his hand and said, "This is a Bible."

Well, I guess that's a good place to start.

       Gender Conflicts  D1 has a few distinctly boyish outfits, picked up at garage sales before she was born or inherited from her uncles. (They're mostly in the size I expect her to outgrow any second now.) Today she was wearing one of them, a blue onesie with a little bear and fish on the front, when we headed out for a walk. Wanting to keep the sun out of her eyes, I decided to get her hat. It's shocking pink with a bow and lace trim. I think the pink won out.  Of course, that was just to make up for last Saturday, when she was wearing a pink onesie and a Milwaukee Brewers hat. (The kind that nachos come in. DOB discovered it was a perfect fit.)  Let's face it, we need a boy, too, to straighten this out.

       Very Disturbing Thought  In a conversation at church this Sunday, the question of diapering before the invention of plastic came up. A friend related that she had known a very elderly woman who could remember her mother walking around, a baby on one hip, and her skirt constantly stiff and smelly with you-kn0w-what.  Ewwww. Did everybody really do that?  On a more pleasant note, D1 is developing the theory that the small objects that periodically strike her face are subject to volitional control. Firm proof has not yet been established, but experiments are ongoing.  And on a less pleasant note, polyester covers or no, it's time for a change.

       Core Functions of Government  Apparently a WA state legislator wants the state secretary of health to publish pamphlets  urlLink promoting small families . I'm not sure what her definition of "population sustainability" is since families of two or fewer children result in a declining population because they don't fill in for those unable to have children at all. Government moralizing is generally despicable, but this is one case where the moniker "Nanny State" doesn't quite fit.

       The Inevitable Baby Post  Anytime you see a timestamp this late you can bet I'm up with D1. Tonight we were going to Get On Schedule and all go to bed on time. We did. D1 decided she didn't want to go to bed yet. So I'm out with her in exile, trying to get her to settle down while letting DOB get his sleep. Last night D1 went 5 hours straight--giving me the longest chunk of sleep I've had since she was born. But two good nights in a row is probably too much to ask for at this stage.  This afternoon we were over with DOB's family and one of the uncles was holding D1. She was defying all his attempts to get her to look him in the face. Finally as a last defiant gesture she flung her bib up over her face so that she couldn't see him.

       First Amendment Watch   In other news, the First Amendment is threatened, once again, by the people who ought to be most concerned about protecting it. The ABA is considering making part of its  urlLink ethics rules  for judges one that forbids them from joining a group that discriminates against homosexuals. This would mean judges would have to leave groups like the Boy Scouts and, presumably, conservative churches as well.  Now, judges do need--more than any other member of society--to both be and appear impartial. But this can only go so far. Would we ban judges from joining the Sierra Club on the presumption that they then could not judge fairly when large chemical-producing corporations came before them? For that matter, why shouldn't a judge belong to, say, an all-female or ethnic club? (Which apparently would be prohibited even under the current rules.) As long as a group does not call for violence or oppression of another group, simply belonging to a group that has restrictions on membership does not intrinsically call into question one's ability to judge fairly.

       Fourth Amendment Watch  After taking His Majesty (aka my dad) to the airport on Saturday, DOB and I sat in a McDonald's parking lot while I fed D1. At the motel next door the police had pulled over a car, arrested the driver, and proceeded to search and impound the car. We initially parked on the far side of McDonald's, but then a few cars obstructed our view, plus it looked like the situation was well under control, so we drove over to the near side of the parking lot. (Shameless gawkers that we are. We tried to gaze only intermittently, though.) The female passenger was standing against the motel wall, watching with a passive-resistant demeanor, and finally made some calls on her cell phone, presumably for other arrangements. Meanwhile the police took a dog and rubber gloves and dug everything out of the car--pillows, clothes, etc.--and strewed it around the ground.  Studying criminal procedure tends to take the blood out of it. (Law can make any subject boring. One could read the Supreme Court case  Jones v. Clinton  cover to cover without finding anything to appeal to the prurient interest.) Watching the thing live and imagining the same thing happening to me on my next vacation makes the Fourth Amendment a vividly important string of words. Even just a search is a huge infringement on personal freedom. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments aren't just about protecting the rights of criminals (as an occasional law-and-order conservative seems to think)--they're about protecting all of us from the dangers of an overzealous state.

       Keyes to Illinois  So it appears that  urlLink Keyes  is going to run for Senate in Illinois. I initially thought this was a bad idea--Keyes isn't even from Illinois (don't want to go pulling a Hillary) and doesn't exactly have a spectacular record of vote-getting.  But after reading some discussion on it, I'm starting to think maybe it's a good idea. The Republican party needs somebody to run in Illinois, but after all that's happened it's too late for a Republican to seriously expect to beat Obama. The GOP's real goal would be to go down fighting, without wasting the prospects of up-and-coming Illinois politicians. Keyes will run a good race, conduct interesting debates with Obama, and generally keep things moving without hurting his career if he loses.  If DOB had time to post on this his thoughts would no doubt be much more profound, but he's supposed to be finishing up work and coming home. ;-)

       Money to Burn  I am cheap. OK, you all knew that already. Cheapness is neither virtuous nor sinful; it is just a habit of not spending money that may be good (as when it causes me to forgo unnecessary expenditures and remain solvent) or bad (as when it tempts me to avoid paying my own fair share).  Thriftiness, on the other hand, is a virtue. In essence, it is the practice of getting maximum value and enjoyment out of your money. Because bankruptcy is no fun, it requires ensuring that money first goes to paying bills and meeting the necessities of life. Next, it would require some level of preparation for the future, appropriate to one's means and future plans. (DOB runs into people making six figures who can't find money to plan for the future. There's something warped there.) After that, thriftiness just means spending less money on things that aren't important to you, so that you can spend more money on things that are.  Part of this whole equation is realizing that time is money, too. Thus, thriftiness may involve spending less money so that you need to spend less time earning money and can spend more time on things that are more important or more fun. Or it might involve spending less money so that you can have a job you enjoy more that pays less.  Thus, there are few particular behaviors or lifestyles that are necessarily thrifty or not. A thrifty person might live on a farm in the middle of nowhere, accessorized with things scrounged from dumpsters and collapsing barns, or they might live in a downtown apartment and spend a thousand dollars on shoes a month. The issue is whether they are living within their means and spending their money on the things that matter to them.  The trouble is, most people don't stop to think about what's important to them and make sure their money is maximized in that direction. Suppose you spend $5 more on lunch and/or coffee every day than you would spend by making these items yourself. (Ha, Marsha, you knew I'd bring it up, didn't you?) Over the course of a year, that's going to be about $1500. Is the taste and convenience of the purchased lunch or coffee worth that much more to you than the house payments/vacation days/donation to your favorite cause that the money could instead be used for? If so, go eat your lunch in peace. (On the other hand, it takes DOB and me less than 5 minutes to pack up leftovers for his lunch. That makes lunch packing an activity worth about $60 an hour--tax free.)  Everybody has to spend at least some money on food, shelter, and clothing. After that, their priorities are going to differ wildly. There will be things that they'd have to be flat broke to give up (for me, internet service would be one); things they'll spend money on as soon as they have any extra (a bigger house on acreage); things they'd spend money on if they had plenty of extra (attending live performances); and things they wouldn't spend money on if you paid them to (convenience food--beans and rice from scratch are healthier for millionaires, too). The important thing is not what order your secondary priorities are in, but whether you spend in that order.  The only action that defies thriftiness across the board is waste, which is simply putting something that still has some use out of reach of any use. No matter how rich I was, I would turn out lights in empty rooms (or maybe set up a snazzy system of automatic sensors ;-) ). If a wealthy person can afford to buy a new outfit for every day they're alive, that's not necessarily wasteful--as long as they dispose of the old ones in a way that lets someone else make good use of them. Even blatant overspending--buying for $150 something that could easily be purchased for $20, say--is not in itself wasteful. At least the money is going to someone engaged in some sort of productive activity.  Other "thrifty" activities may be thrifty or not, depending on your circumstances. Right now, garage saling is a thrifty activity for me because I live in a neighborhood with lots of garage sales, and I can get a lot of the things I need right now (children's clothes and toys, household furnishings) at them. Before this year I didn't have those factors and I had never shopped at a garage sale. On the other hand, in the past I have driven very decrepit cars because I had my dad and brother to do a fair amount of the work on them. Now I live on the other side of the country, and DOB and I don't have the space or skills to do the work ourselves, so that's no longer a thrifty strategy.  I'm cheap, and I can't help it. I work on being thrifty--which for me usually means being willing to spend money on the things that really do matter to me, and when necessary accepting the tradeoff of spending more money to save time and energy.

      Some people carry the " urlLink fairy-tale wedding " concept a bit too far.  OK, I can picture the bride in wings attended by fairies, but where on earth did they find groomsmen willing to be "frolicking elves"? It's hard enough to get a guy into a tux. Now if they were playing Tolkien elves, armed for an Orc attack, I could imagine it better.  I would thank  urlLink Deontologist , but I bet he just gakked it from Dave Barry.

       How brightly shines the moon  I was finally able to show   urlLink The Taming of the Shrew   to DOB last night. And he enjoyed it as much as I hoped he would. It's such a great story about real love: not namby-pamby niceness, but the desire to see someone become the person they were meant to be, whatever it costs to help them get there. On what it means to be a leader. On the difference between a marriage that's a true team and one where each person maintains their own separate objectives and tries to manipulate the other.  And it's hilarious.

       Mental Notes  It's much easier to remove the seal from a bottle of baby shampoo when NOT holding a wet baby. It's also much easier to transport a freshly bathed baby if you don't leave the towel in the other room.

       Something We Can All Cheer . . .   It's rare that a bill comes out in Congress that deserves unmixed support, and when it does it's usually repealing something. Surely  urlLink this  is one we can all get behind: repealing the unconstitutional (still is, no matter what the Supreme Court says) restrictions on talking about politicians shortly before an election. It's good for Michael Moore. It's good for the NRA. It's good for candidates who happen to own  urlLink car dealerships . It's good for America.

       College Expenses  We have received a comment that, cheaply as we may think we can get by with babies, vast expenditures are lurking eighteen years down the road. Now, we may only have a baby so far, but remember we were just in college ourselves and are still pursuing additional credentials. Also DOB is a financial planner and helps people save for their children's education, so we are not blind to the costs.  First of all, let me make a shocking pronouncement: Parents have no moral obligation to put their children through college. None. If you feed and clothe your child until he is able to work for himself, and give him enough education to read fluently, write coherently, and do enough math to not get cheated, you have fulfilled your financial obligation towards the child.  Further, parents aren't required to fund a college education for all their children, even if they do it for some. My parents funded some of their children's post-high school training and not others, depending on a wide variety of factors, including their own inscrutable reasons. We don't hate each other.  And not every child needs to go to college. None of my grown brothers has a college degree. One works in construction, and one is in the navy. One is a manager at a large software firm, and has never been held back by his lack of a degree. There are still a lot of fields where what you can do is more important than how many extra letters you have.  But there are many fields where credentials are necessary, and it's likely enough some of our children will want to pursue some of them. If we have the money to help them out, we might want to do so. And if we do so, I will repeat the lecture my mother gave to all teenagers: "Getting the credentials is just a game. Find the quickest and cheapest way to jump through the hoops that you can, and get it over with."  There are scholarships. There are work/study programs. There are much cheaper schools than Harvard. There are equivalence tests. If they really want an education, they can work and study for it. If they don't want it enough to help reduce the costs in one of the above ways, why should we pay for it?  This mindset leaves out two important aspects of a college education. One is the social aspect. About this, I am heartlessly indifferent. Any advantage of meeting different people and ideas they miss out on they can have while engaged in productive activity; any advantage of hanging out with other juveniles they can fund on their own. The other is the possibility of pursuing a great liberal arts education, broadening the mind and joining in the Great Conversation. Most colleges don't do this anymore, and those that do are by no means necessarily the most expensive. Besides, it is my hope that we'll raise them so that they will be broadening their minds and thinking about great ideas for their whole lives.

       Laundry Room Meditations  DOB was horrified to discover that I have a racist, segregationist, laundry scheme: Whites on Monday, Darks on Tuesday, Coloreds on Wednesday. He dreams of the day when our clothes will be judged, not by the color of their skein, but by the content of their fiber.  And I've long wondered why, when I get detergent or stain remover on my hands, I feel compelled to wash it off with soap. Isn't what I am washing off essentially soap?  Another developmental landmark: D1 has learned to make spit bubbles. (This will no doubt soon have consequences in the laundry department.)

       Minor Developments  Everybody knows the big Baby Book Milestones: first tooth, walking, first word. But the fun of being a parent is watching the gradual development of a full-fledged human being, in steps so tiny anybody else would miss them.  The other evening, DOB set D1 on her back on the bed, with a couple of stuffed carrots on her arms to keep her company. We expected her to pretty much flail her arms and ignore them. Instead, she grasped one of the carrots with both hands and patiently manipulated it until she had its nose (so some stuffed carrots have noses) in her mouth, and tried sucking on it. Whereupon she screamed in annoyance to find no milk forthcoming.  Now, this seems small. But consider all the development that goes into it. Not only is she aware that there is a world around her, she has come to the realization that she can manipulate and control objects in the world. She can form theories about what will happen and then test them to see if they will work. It's the beginning of all work and play, of hand-eye coordination, and of interacting with the world rationally, as a human being, rather than by instinct alone. She's made giant strides from the passive newborn of six weeks ago.  Of course, this deepens our speculation on whether she has figured out that  parents  are manipulatable, too.
