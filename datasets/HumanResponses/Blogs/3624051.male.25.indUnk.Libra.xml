      here are my views on topics we discussed over the phone:  1.car park. one thing i already i discussed was the issure of security. i don't  think it is very safe to park a car outside. and mom thinks it is only a matter of  time before we buy a car, since she realises it as an essential. she is not  comfortable with the idea of not having a car park. dad adds that having a car  park also adds resale value of the house to a considerable amount. and my  suggestion of leaving it open as a garden doesn't water either because dad needs a  flat surface to walk around.  2. attached toilet for dad. i discussed with dad again on this issue. he is very  fine with having the present arrangement because he wants his bedroom somewhat cut  off from the toilet. and looking at the design again, having a door leading  directly into the toilet will take away space from the wall where we plan to out  up their cupboard and dad's writing table. think about that space loki... and of  course it can double as a guest toilet, so that we don't have to have  another(saving on space and money). the toilet size would be of the one you were  using upstairs. very ideal i think, i discussed with mom and dad.  3. extra bedroom. nobody is fine with this idea.. another bedroom=another floor=  more money=more maintainence. mom possibly cant climb up to check on that floor.  and she said maintaining this house itself is tough on her. i say.. we are having  open terrace on the second floor( as per the present design) and we can definitely  go ahead and build it at a later time whenever we want. i really dont think it is  necessary at this point in time.i also thought of somehow accomodating on the first floor itself but at the cost  of terrace and smaller rooms i just dont think its worth it.  4. my toilet. lokesha i am really very happy having just a basin and a toilet.  personally i love toilets to be small and bright which is exactly what i have.  mmm.. maybe i will give it a thought.. but let me tell you i am not compromising  for anything... its just the way i wanted it to be.

      It is customary to park the car right in front of the house obliterating the main door. I consider the main door as open and welcoming and not closed or obstructed. I see a garage or a car space as aloof, a place to keep aside a machine once used, and therefore apart from the house. One could argue about minimizing the distance from the car-door to home-door, but design can circumvent it.

      Loki writes:   I must begin by stating that this&nbsp;project has been in our minds for a very long time and is now seeing the light. Many things have come together and I'm very excited about this venture. As we embark upon this journey, new to all of us, I thought of a common place to sit our ideas and record the progresion of events from start to finish.   Vivek sent me the drawings for the house two days ago. I liked the open spacing on the ground floor. Often my concern that the place (site) is a little small creeps into me. But from a designer's bent of mind, I want to start off with this premise, treat it as my&nbsp;constraint&nbsp;and see how far we can go (push) &nbsp;in terms of space.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Experience&nbsp;in the design consulting industry has drummed the importance of gathering requirements first before considering design. Usability, Information architecture, User experience have all re-inforced us one thing : the user is God. it is HE/HER who ultimately uses the designed product and therefore deserves all of the focus, importance, attention from the people in the business of serving him/her.   Translated to our purposes, we are building a residence for the Muthuramalingams and it is only apt to start gathering needs and expectations from all of us. Since Mom and Dad will be enjoying the&nbsp;residence to a considerably greater extant than vivek or me, (as i envision it for now) the requirements that we obtain from them should be given careful consideration. Then can follow ours. I am under the assumption that this exercise has been done and I am to chip in mine.   If i were to design a common place to gather needs and wants from each of us, i'd give each a paper with areas to fill for    a) must have for me in a house    b) great to have&nbsp; in a house    c) houses&nbsp;that I&nbsp;admire    Here is my answered sheet:    a) must haves       conceptual  must haves:    light   airiness  flow  intergity to the whole&nbsp;    practical  must haves      accessibility for dad. I was introduced to the wonderful world of accessibility while designing a web application&nbsp;and see no reason why this shouldn't be embraced in all walks of life. All public places in the US are by law required to be assessible to people with special needs. I see this translating as giving very careful attention to height, considering elimination of stairs, using material that is less prone to slipping, etc.   A large bedroom for mom and dad that can accomodate a library and writing area with an accessible large bathroom in the ground floor for mom and dad (This is an important piece to design in the ground floor)  A kitchen that is very easy on mom, anything that can help her cook by reducing effort and walk. (With good room for a fridge!)  A bright dining &nbsp;area. I am convinced of the&nbsp;dining table&nbsp;being the central place of the family to unite. Accessibility to the dining area should be easy both for mom and dad.   Two bed rooms with a full bath for each in the first floor.     b) Great to have:    A balcony ( I love our balcony in the current home and Maya loves it too!)  A fourth Bedroom  Providing an easy access for washing clothes and cleaning utensils and keeping them removed from the bathroom. (Often I see the bathroom moonlighting as a place to do the dishes. Its difficult and hogs the bathroom)  Pest control mechanisms that can be incorporated at time of construction.  A darkroom for vivek. Even designing the bathroom so that it can accomodate a sink and developing materials would be great to have  Open area to plant shrubs and creepers around and above.  Solar heating capabilities  Niches. I'm fond of niches, rectangular     c) Houses I admire    My philosophy for the  kind  or  feel  of the house would be more classicist than cutting edge. Something that assimilates the qualities and appeal of construction through the ages. I am enamoured by things of lasting value. Contemporary, yet informed classically would be something I'd like to explore. I am thinking how I would perceive this house 20 years from now?  the elevation of homes that reflect a studied simplicity and elegance. Simple beautiful forms married with beautiful choice of plants  Off-white stucco houses offset by brick-red tiles. I find enormous appeal in that combination. I&nbsp;admire a&nbsp;"raheja?" house right&nbsp;at the corner of sankey road turn. (beside the citibank atm)&nbsp;&nbsp;  A museum in singapore had the perfect combination of color and material. I'll send a picture of that.   These will be some of the things I can think off.&nbsp; If the rest of you like the appeal of this format and&nbsp;gather&nbsp;together what everyone has written,&nbsp;we can get our answers together and see how the picture shapes up. If you feel you've done the exercise already then just review some of my notes to inform the design. I'll try to explore some concepts as well and share it here. Lets also work on exploring maybe a couple of more ideas. This will only help reinforce the best design we have at hand.

      the architect's view point on some outstanding items:  1. Can the entrance be shifted to the side of the common wall and have the greenarea or car park there? Great idea because the entry will corner into the North-East.But... i.the wall/elevation on the South Road side becomes quite flat and unattractive.The car shall be parked in the corner of the house making the house feel claustrophobic thanks to the compound wall with another house at the other end (similar to the situation we have at the present house) stopping light and ventilation. ii.Also...the dining and living doesnt remain a continuous non-interruptedspace. We shall have (as the previously decided design) 32'6" of wall-less space while inthis scenario we compartmentalize each space of dining, kitchen, lobby and theliving.You can judge the feeling of the space by comparing to the present house, wherethe living-dining, inclusive of the breath of the staircase, is almost 24 feet. iii. The kitchen must be in the South East corner or the North west (optionally)by Vaastu...the plan is designed such that the Kitchen projects out in the SouthEast quadrant of the property. iv. The little margin we leave inbetween the living and the North side of the property can act as the drying yard during rains. The ugly look of the dryingclothes can be easily hidden by drawing a nice curtain. While with the suggested location of the entry, mamma has no choice but to hang clothes on the Terrace level everyday.With her problems with servants and their working habits, and her athritis soon becoming worse, this is in trial to makeher climb the staircase the least.  2. Can the staircase be in such a way that people who would want to go to thefirst floor directly wouldnt have to cross other spaces of the house?If this option is for the "late comers" then it works well in the existingscenario as well. One can come into the main gate, walk down the side towards the Southside, enter into the utility, through the door leading into the house from there andup the staircase.  3. Can vivek's toilet be bigger?Yes it only helps the design but it wont be as large as the other toilet on thesame floor, altough i promise it shall be sufficient.  4. Can we have an additional bedroom on the Second floor? Yes we can. But the reasons don't satisfy me as an architect and i would advice against the option as a professional consultant on this project.the reasons are: i. it is expensiveii. from the perspective of the main users Mamma and Uncle, this is a bad optionfor the sake of the maintainence of the house and the sake of their comfort. The second bedroom- (in the present house) the one besides the room Vivek uses -is continuously maintained with not a soul using it and with great trouble. I believe a space that requires to be used 15 days in 365 days of a year, needs least importance, focus and expenditure. iii. The house shall look unattractive as compared to just a Ground and Firstfloor. It will look too tall in proportion to the property. We are already over-building  5. About corner windows vs central window in the particular context the corner window suites perfectly for the sake ofcross ventilation also adding to the aesthetics of the house. windows in eachroom have been located with respect to the best possible furniture layout.therefore, and because we are keeping vaastu in mind through the design the headof the bed should be in the south. south is not the ideal direction to bring inlight from due to its property of being extremely harsh and strong. best lightcomes from north, therefore the walls in the north are designed to be treated inglass and perforated materials in spite of that being the abutting side. all windows shall be long if not extremely wide.

        Car Park: we&nbsp; will  have a car park   Attached Bathroom: we will&nbsp; not  have an attached bathroom in the ground floor   2&nbsp; full  baths in the first floor. One can be common, one can be attached. Vivek, you will have to make do with one full bath room instead of your 5X4 shitpot.  .....................  2 bedroom Vs 3 bedrooms: I still would like a third bedroom. Since I vetoed the bathrooms on the first floor, I will leave room for your collective decision on that. We'll decide really soon about this (will call you tmorow)    the  third  bedroom on the first floor will instead be moved as a separate room on the second floor . It wil have no bathroom, but we should set up the plumbing lines so that later on, we can add a bathroom easily. (based on our conversation july 27th)

      Ground Floor     First Floor     Originating comments: OPTION 3 * ENTRANCE - a nice secluded entry, with a possibily of a seating under the second flight of stairs leading into a nice lobby * ENTRY - entry to house is from EAST therefore acceptable * LIVING - centrally placed once again, congested * DINING - positioned to side, therefore not much movement across * KITCHEN - open fairly sized kitchen with possibility of a herb garden outside * UTILITY - good sized traditional,but facing road * BEDROOM - ventilation can be managed, square bedroom * TOILET - fair but odd size * FIRST FLOOR - family space, bedrooms with individual attached toilets, and sizeable ones * STORE - an addition to the requirement. * TERRACE - opening into the NORTH EAST corner.  TOTAL SQFT AREA OF BUILT UP - 1798  THEREFORE COST OF CONSTRUCTION - 1123200 + 20%

      Ground Floor    Originating Comments: Highlights: - Entrance faces north east(best vastu) - The stairs are immediate to the entrance. Vivek can quitely sneak upstairs without attracting attention from the rest of the household :) - The living room enjoys seclusion.  - The living room view to the outside is unbroken and sits in the best corner facing outside. (This is taking advantage of the corner property) -the master bedroom is large and can accomodate writing/office/computer space for mom and dad -In First Floor, we can have 3 bed rooms one on top of kitchen, living and gf master bedroom. Above the car park can be balcony. - the car park, in my opinion, is in its best place. - the utility area is adjacent to the kitchen and convenient for maids to help clean. A separate door can be added.  Loki's additional thoughts:  - The arrangement of space is similar to the design you sent me first v1.00 (exepting master bath, the kitchen, living and dining and bde on GFloor sit similarly) This has been the best so far, in my opinion, in the arrangement of spaces that we've seen in other plans. ie, I like the living room and car park facing eastword, I like the bedroom to the westward region, I like the combined flow of kitchen, living and dining.   - What is tempting is to extract the best of v1.00 and v1.02 and come up with a hybrid plan.

      THE MAIN CONCEPT OF THE DESIGN FOR THE MUTHURAMALINGAM HOUSE:   1. maintainence should be low  2. dad's convineince should be taken care of.  3. mom should have to climb the first floor the least.  4. the dining and kitchen ought to be central to the house.  5. good light and ventilation.6. as many terraces as possible.  7. green patches around the house.

      i would like to add the following in addition to all the information that lavannya has already given you: 1. first of all you should remember that the black and white film is VERY sensitive to the colour BLUE than the colour film is. therefore most photographers starting out with the B&W complain that they aren't able to capture the mood of the sky just the way they saw them when they clicked it. this is simply because the blue sky is over exposed with respect to the film and it appears plain white. now this is where your filter system helps. 2. the red filter blocks the blue light from the sky (and also cyan and green, opposite colours on the colour wheel), makes it look darker and thereby increase its contrast with the white clouds. so now you have the skies look like you want them to. some feel it obviously exaggerates the situation and therefore they would prefer yellow, which is more closer to reality. 3. different manufacturers have different numbers for the filters they manufacture. one of the more popular ones, COKIN, have the number for red as 003, yellow as 001.. 4. cost of the filter would be roughly around 800, but you would have to buy the adapter ring and the mount too if this is the first filter. i think thats another 800.  5. the filter always takes away something from the picture.. never adds. and when you are including greenery too through your red filter remember that they would appear darker too. i would suggest that you get comfortable without a filter first and then plan on investing on one. 6. you can get your filters from here: fotocircle (mr.Jayesh) no. 2, KV temple street, SSK Sangha Building, Near Balepet Circle, Next to New Chickpet Police Station. 22874356. regards, vivek m

       urlLink    kanoor  a small write-up about one of my treks... but couldn't go on to complete it.  A Monsoon trek through the Sharavathy Valley Wildlife Sanctuary.  urlLink (few pictures)  Our circadian rhythms seemed to awaken our senses as we got restless with the smell of the approaching Indian monsoons.  We knew it was time to go on that trek. Days of putting together of information of benevolent trekkers who shared their escapades over the internet was of very little help.  Not many people could even sketch out a rough route to the abandoned fort of Kanoor, presumably deep in the jungles of the Sharavathy valley. Nevertheless we were ready to go, fuelled by the promise of walks through verdant foliage, of sweet rain mingling with our sweat and of making the pretty tiled roofs in Malnad our home for a few days. So armed with only the names of a few places and a concocted route we landed at Sagara bus stop at 6 am on a misty morning. I had been here in this town more than a few times but watching the dark hours of a morning chugging slowly into a busy day is such a fascination. The newspaper guys are the first to claim the bus stand. Newspapers brought from Shimoga in carefully labeled bundles are unpacked for their final destination. The supplements are tucked into the main papers and so is the occasional pamphlet announcing a new restaurant in this little town. The baker arrives a little later with his young daughter and an umbrella. While he mechanically goes about prodding the show-case a little into the open, sprucing up the unsold cakes and exchanging pleasantries with his neighbors, his daughter gets busy sweeping their part of the bus stand. The woman selling strings of wild jasmines and champa takes her customary corner. The Udupi restaurateur finally gives orders to open the half pulled down shutter. As the light of the sodium finally goes off, the cacophony of the neatly dressed bus conductors becomes prominent.  Our conductor arrives at 7 30 am. He promises to put us down at Hosagadde in another hour and a half. As soon as we reach Hosagadde, a little bus stop, rain drenched and red-oxide floored threw a dejavu as we reminisced about similar looking ones at the beginning of a lot other treks. It was a perfect place to rearrange baggage, get the cameras out, feel comfortable in a pair of shorts and generally prepare ourselves for a new and exciting journey that none of us had experienced before.  A shop-keeper next to the bus stop confirmed that this indeed was the route to Dabbe falls, our destination for the first day. A rough path took us peacefully for sometime before it got murkier. We stopped. A cowherd thankfully directed us back on track but it wasn’t easy. We passed through many a farm jumping over fences, crossing bridges of slippery areca trunks, navigating check-dams overflowing with water. Gowdru mane was finally in sight at around 2 in the afternoon. It had started to pour heavily as we struggled to establish our identity behind our suspicious looking rain coats. I was an absolute alien in my borrowed blue rain coat. Once the dogs were the silenced, the masters quickly engaged us in a Q&A session. They invited us inside, for warmth and a place to keep our rug sacks. An even warmer conversation over a straw mat put us completely at ease.  Dabbe falls was not even close to what we had imagined it to be. It looked like a long silvery thread cut in pieces bisecting the thick evergreens of the valley. Worst still, it was absolutely unapproachable being on the other side of the valley we were on. So all we could do was to precariously descend down for a little distance before we managed to get a satisfying view of the falls and some photographs. Getting down itself was an adventure since the descent was steep, no sign of a path and plenty of leeches. We finally ended our attempts in search of better views and made our way back to Gowdru mane.  The Gowdru, it seemed, was however apprehensive about our plan to spend the night at his place. He definitely wasn’t in favor of our stay under his roof. Our plan for the night obviously had to be altered. Disappointment and confusion set in as we pondered about our next move. We had lost considerable time already exploring around the water fall, taking Gowdru mane for granted as our halt for the night. A quick conversation with the people revealed our possible destination to be a school, Shaale mane.  After getting off track plenty of times, we finally reached the home of Neel Kumar just as the night was making its appearance. His home was perfect (like all the homes in Malnad are!). His genuine friendliness was contagious and we sat down in his verandah to talk about life in cities and the price of coffee.  ‘How big is Bengaluru?’ he asked. I said quite big, it takes an hour to travel from one end to the other. His wife carried a small oil lamp to join our conversation. ‘You know, we are getting electricity to our village’, she gleefully said, ‘all the villagers are pitching in to help the workers in getting the lamp posts erected’. I looked at her. Her smile was no less innocent from a child’s and I loved the fact that she is so delighted with the idea of getting a lamp in her home. The verandah went silent for some time as I looked at the hills fading into darkness, the soft light reflecting from their wrinkled faces, listened to the sound of a nightjar, the trickle of rain from the tile above, caught the scent of wild jasmine and the felt the coolness of clear crisp air silently settling amidst us. My destination was reached, I thought. This is exactly why I wanted to be here, to be among things that let my senses feel a slice of pure bliss, to talk to people who believe happiness can only be a state of mind, to wonder like a child at matters that intrigue our innocent minds.

      sometimes its not good to have a sound sleep. i haven't been having for quite sometime now and i think thats because my mind is in a turmoil. its not particularly related to anything but these days are like seasons, we go through it because it is there, we don't ask why it is different. but i understand the necessity to go through them, i know it leads you to a deserving place for sure. my mind wanders more often now but i am glad it maintains good interest in molecular biology to keep me going strong in grasping the intricacies of genetic engineering. am getting to like biochemistry... i spoke to lokesh for a long time. he seemed really happy about me getting both the prizes in the black and white category, first and third urlLink (here are the pictures that i shot for the competition including the winning entries).  and what meant most was the fact that Perumal was the judge. he knows i will balance both medicine and photography well.. he thinks and knows i should... i will. i have already started thinking about my entries for monuments. pictures from mandu is surely going because i don't think i can shoot fresh ones now. and i can't seem to think of a place i go to either. lepakshi was disappointing. i wasn't satisfied and i feel sad i couldn't click pictures like i wanted to. maybe i will go through the negatives once again. mandu ruins will be good, i think, my favourite would the broken wall and the tree in the background picture. another would be of the corridor but i am not sure if they would appreciate my perspective in that particular picture. can't think of anything else that i could submit. oh yes! the ruins at mullaiyangiri... but the theme is monuments.. that particular picture doesn't somehow fit in.. i feel. i should make time and travel one day to click some pictures for the 'monuments.' have been already visualizing few concepts, rough compositions... it helped a lot for the previous competition. oh yes.. am so glad kishore won the first place for colour! i knew lavannya will win but kishore will get a such a boost with that recognition. he will be enthusiastic enough to keep shooting better pictures...

      i think i started this out of curiousity than a serious urge scribble haikus on an online journal. but the possiblity of getting to know interesting people by giving them a peephole into my life is good an excuse to start blogging! maybe because i also met an interesting blogger,  urlLink anita  at a photography exhibition. i finally posted some of my pictures of the  urlLink nilgiris trek  for the rest of the trekker team to view. i posted most of the pictures from the one and a half rolls of film that i shot with. its strange... six days... nilgiris... only few rolls... but i successfully manage to surprise myself with such stuff. but i think i was just being myself, i couldn't somehow come to terms with the set of new friends who seemed to actually feel this was a nice way to get their noisy kids oriented towards nature. i think i expected a group more involved and interested in the wildflowers, mountains hidden by the mist, the noise of the cicadas. my mistake. in the process of getting used to the group i completely ignored photography and ended clicking only a couple of pictures on day one... tonight's dinner was such a gastronomic delight!  urlLink lavannya's  ryze aquaintance runs an excellent far eastern cuisine restaurant called the 'shiok' in indiranagar. i met madhu himself and he suggested(and cooked) us the perfect meal! and as always painted platter offered us yet another sinful desert, Chocophile this time.

       urlLink    sunset at gaalikere. we made this trek just for ravi's sake who had come down from england. he desperately wanted to catch a slice of our adventure before he realises he won't have the time to do so... kishore and i planned this to perfection... till the day one that is! we pitched our tent near gaalikere(the lake of winds), ran around madly in search of pictures and finally settled down at this point to talk... and as every minute inched closer to darkness the fiery streaks of light on the distant skies made us silent... for quite sometime.

       urlLink    we always seem to forget each others birthdays but when it comes to plotting yet another trek in the mountains we shamelessly seek each other. srini is impulsive, fast, terribly enthusiastic... so much not like me... but there are only few others whose company i would love to have on my treks... i hope srini's aspiration of high altitude trekking comes alive some day... i caught him on this photograph at the gopalswamy betta when we went assisting mr.perumal on his 'macro' shoot.

       urlLink    kanoor trek. a view from gowdru's home. beyond the fields was the dabbe waterfalls... we tried getting down the valley but soon realised it was almost suicidal in the rains... we just got a glimpse of it. few trekkers have reached the base of the waterfalls in summer.. they tell me.

Wrapped in a polythene, tucked away safe in my mind a little goodbye, maybe, or just a passing smile   The birds fly away to the sky still searching for home a bunch o' paper flowers, or a little child left all alone Can somebody hear me, I'm screaming from so far away morning who'll calm you, the evening's eclipsed again  *Well does life get any better more yesterday than today How I thought the sun would shine tommorow But it rained...  They justified the cause for which Daddy might give up his life ,it's been so long, so long a time but still I miss Daddy at night The ache is long gone but the never keeps staring at me the waters in the seas are high, and all the sand castles have drowned  *Well does life get any better more yesterday than today How I thought the sun would shine tommorow But it rained...  -parikrama.

       urlLink    maarkandeshwara temple, vokkaleri, kolar. mandakini finally found the time to travel with us, something she always wanted to do she said, although this was a short trip. we packed some snacks and started out in binu's estate when it started to pour. i mean REALLY pour. it was so hard for him to drive... we went really slow.. enjoyed the rain and the by the time we reached vokkaleri it seemed to have completely stopped. and as we went up the winding road to the temple we were greeted by a beautiful peacock! it was wonderful.. the rain had just stopped... the sun was peeping out.. black coulds still hanging close... everything seemed fresh and green... and we were with people we really enjoyed being with! we missed kishore though. and another surprise was awaiting.. as you can see from the picture... a beautiful rainbow. i caught a candid picture as srini ecstatically pointed out to the rainbow. if any of my days came close to being perfect... maybe this was it!

DRS in the horizon.. it was amazing. i shot this with the last few frames of the colour film on my canon... i came back the very same day with srini, ravi, chav... i was so excited! i took a lot of pictures in black and white this time...

      I looked again and again at those ghastly images to understand what Raghu Rai had particularly seen and felt. And each time I stood in front of them I saw something new, interesting and painful. After an immediate appreciation of Raghu’s innate attraction to human life, we got down to discussing a handful of photographs that missed our ovation. But looking closer, giving time for the photographs to seep into us we embarrassed ourselves of our earlier thoughts.  The child with the flawless face being buried was a justified opener, the rubble and a hand over the child’s face made the mood perfect. This picture won the world press photograph of the year. The pictures got more intriguing and although the composition of the each of the photographs was extremely intelligent, the viewers’ mind was cleverly shifted to notice the graveness of the disaster.  I tried to put down some excerpts from an informal discussion that we had with Raghu Rai.  About the night of the disaster:  I was woken up by my editors on that night and by 8am the next day I was in Bhopal. There was death all around me, the roads strewn with dead animals with bloated bellies and stench… there were people dying, especially children. I was afraid about the effect of the poisonous gas on my own body but I had to go on shooting. That was my job. A lot of people ask me how I could be taking pictures when I am a witness to a tragedy unfolding in front me, shouldn’t I be helping them and put down my camera. If I do my job to my outmost satisfaction, giving one hundred percent, I know I have done my part. Everything else will take care of itself.  About using monochromes:  I used black and whites particularly in this situation since the medium diverts all the attention to the drama and the emotions in the picture which can otherwise be diluted by colours. For example if a subject in the picture is wearing a yellow shirt during a burial scene the mood tends to be contradictory…  About styles in photography:  Quite a few people come up to me and say sir, we idolize in you… I say that’s fine if you want to be like me then do so. But look inside you… there is a guru, learn from him. Style is special to each person, and photographers should try to explore and realize their own styles…  About press photography:  The human face is a mirror of the real person behind it… try to capture the seldom seen moods and emotions of politicians that is an indicator of his real character rather than capturing him cutting tapes and lighting lamps…  About digital photography:  We have to embrace new technology and it would be stupid if we stick to classical methods saying they are nostalgic. I am planning to go digital shortly with a Nikon D100.  About equipment:  All I carry is one camera, and one lens which would be either a 24-70 or a 28-70 lens.  His inspiration during his younger days:  Henri Cartier Bresson, who incidentally worked with Magnum too.

      Lines interweave to baffle once more Fighting for attention from the confused soul Trying to reach the inner most circles Trying to be the brightest one To lead into the secrets hidden And to do that in their style Don’t let you in with ease Demand your time, your purest senses When eyes converse with the relaxed mind When the thoughts whorl out To acknowledge the otherside When white is churned out To yield the deepest hue The lines rest then… And let you become one amongst them.

      heres one of rumi's that i had put down on my hard disc quite sometime ago:  Now that your soul has entered my all-too-present flesh And made with it a soul in kind, Your each embarking thought, The breathing swing and sway of your movement Makes an impression on the wax of my surrendering will, My mind is but a pillow Indented by the flow of your passing thoughts. My newly-moulded soul is alight with Your pulsing grace, your secret deceptions Have transformed dead stone to fire. Each new day is a slow beginning New lamentations rise From the reed of my longing for your lip; Your loving candour strokes the mouth of the reed With a sweet languishing refrain. My soul imitates and installs Your moon’s soft milk-light in its chambers. I mould myself to fit your form Like a belt for the waist, even when Your eye has tethered me with angry scowls Turning me this way and that until My distracted heart jumps out of itself.  -divan 2313.

      silence preceeds the monotonous din the rains falling endless in sheets the path seems lit but i cannot see the people with sharp shadows coming close i ask the glistening eyes the way and a soul points into the waiting fog i take my track on the greasy grass a slip and a shake and a heart beat fast into the white i see some trunks of long dead wood with mossy coat i let myself into the descending road but i stand in moment at a confused stop i look back to my partner but seldom seen a feeble light from the farther hill i trace back to the original stand and ponder once again at the way not mine.

      an intense desire to remain inert thoughts and wishes move me little i recall the day's morning when splashes of hue made me blind a little unknown building of nameless preachers the dull walls of age and abandon tiny souls cramped into firm affection the curious eyes of a distracted child tri coloured flags flutter in myriad ways shadows of feeble feet drag along into streets resonating with a familiar noise dark rooms peep through frameless windows rows of wooden benches piled upon each sight of roses withering to dark scarlet and lifeless speaches of useless things
