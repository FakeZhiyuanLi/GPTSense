      Tonight me and Tommy, Tyler, Kenny, and John went to the Go-Karts on the Berlin Turnpike and it was awesome again. I suggest you all go when we go again next sunday. I have decided to have a pool party on the 17th of july at 6 p.m. you should go! Today my pool was finally finished and i took a nice swim in it. Next week i start being a counceler at camp for the boys club. I will do it for 4 weeks. I really had fun last year and the kids wanted me to do more sessions this year so i decided to. After i finish camp my cruise will set sail (hell ya) on august 1st which means we have to drive to florida which i really enjoy, you get to see alot of the country and you can fall asleep and wake up ina different state its so great. After we get back from the cruise its a week long we will go to Disney and adventure islands and all those parks then head to my noni's house to see her because she means alot to me. I started digging the trampoline deeper into the ground yesterday so i wont hit the ground when i jump. So its getting late im gonna head out so you should all come to my pool party the 17th its gonna be so fun...... later
