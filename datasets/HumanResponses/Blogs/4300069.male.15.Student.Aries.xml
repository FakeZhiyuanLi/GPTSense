						   My name is Robert Ames, I am gothic and I show it.  I wear black pants, I like these ones that I got from Hot Topic mostly.  I wear almost any form of black shirt, perferably silk.    I have 4 rings, one that is a full finger ring, you can see what kind it is by watching Interview With A Vampire, but it's a different style.  I have a Celtic ring that I just got a few days ago.  I have a half-finger ring that looks like some sort of dead bug, but I like it anyway, a spike goes over the second joint of my index finger, It's cool.  Last I have a ring that my ex girlfriend gave me, it's just a small band that broke a couple of days ago, but I still carry it with me.  She left me for a guy named Emilliono, some Mexican dude.  Yes I know darling, you don't like me using "Mexican" but I couldn't remember what you called them.  I wear a pendant that has three skulls one looking straight, one to the left and one to the right.  There is a cresent moon behind them that is turned 90 degrees so that it faces down.  I have 16 safety pins lineing my right cargo pocket, I did have 20 but my bro stole some.  One of them has a pentagram hanging from it.  I have 6 chains haning off of my pants, now thats what I call bondage *winks*.  No, it's just for style but I do have a chain addiction.  Other than all of this goth stuff, I am really a Renaissance person trapt in this time period.  So when I move away from Kansas, up to the west coast somewhere.  I will work in my family's bed and breakfast that is to come.  Hopefully I can drag Kasey with me when she is 15 or 16, I doubt that will happen though *cries*.  But I will come find her when I am 18 so I can at least see her.  When she turns to an age where she can leave her parents I'm going to come get her and take her with me.  If she so chooses.

						   My girlfriends name is Kasey Dunagan.  She is my life, I could not live the way I am now without her.  She keeps my life running smoothly and if she left me or died, I wouldn't have a life anymore.  I would be an empty shell on this earth that is still capable of moving.  I feel as though everything I do is for her, everything that I am, my heart beats, my thoughts, my creations, every move that I make, it is all for her.  I don't run my life, she does.  I'm glad that she does too, or else a few people would be dead by now.  Kasey is a good poetry writer, everything she has made has touched me dearly and got me thinking about how it relates to my life.  Some of her writeings have made me cry because of some of the topics and what went on in them.  Like Sister Dearest, that is probably my favorite one.  Kasey and I have songs that we declared ours, Perfect by Simple Plan, The Reason by Hoobastank, and Pieces by ummm... I don't remember her name, I think it's Ashley Simpson though.  When Kasey broke up with me (that only lasted a day), the only thing I could think of was the song "The Reason".  It descirbed exsactly how I felt and what I wanted to say.  Sorry I'm just going on and on lol.

						   The first and second days of school for me went pretty well.  I met my friends, met my teachers, and even got a little bit of homework, grrrrrr.  I missed Kasey while I was there and it was hard for me to do some of my work because she was on my mind the whole time.  But thats ok because she is my priority in life.  I didn't get tired walking up and down the stairs because of all the bikeing I did over the summer.  But like any normal day I am always tired for no reason at all.  I will let you go now and read some of my other posts, if I do anymore.

						   Time is the creation of everything, yet the destruction of it all, and when time stands still, everything falls.  When the new moon rises, I awaken. I am numb and unconnected, in this world I am consumed with hate and sin. Looked upon with wonder, yet no one understands, that the darkness within me, is darker than the devil within.  It's the darkest hour, when the sands of time stand still. It's the darkest hour, when the devils come out to kill. It's the darkest hour, when the sands of time stand still. It's the darkest hour, when everyone's filled with fear.  When the darkness comes I show my pain, the devils come and take me away. If you take a look around, this world is filled with hate and shame.  Chorus 2x

						   When I woke up this morning, a tear strolled down my face. I knew I needed someone, in this dreadful place. You've shown me what I needed, you've been there through my pain. I can see that I love you, and that you love me too.  Your in my dreams, my love shows through. Your in my heart, and I need you.  Come and take my hand, I'll take you to this place. Where love lasts forever. Where there is no shame. I can see it in your eyes, that this is no game, and I can not deny, that our love is the same.  Chorus 2x*
