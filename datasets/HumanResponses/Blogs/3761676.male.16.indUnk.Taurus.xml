      I talked to Mike last night. Mike says the hat should have worked, but since it didn't, we need to get serious.  Mike told me he found out from Erika that Chelsea likes skaters with  skills .  I told Mike thats so ghetto, because I can kickflip and ollie almost as good as Matt, the last guy she dated.  Mike told me I need to be  better  than Matt if I want her to notice, so we better get to work on my  skills .  Mike says we can go and practice on the rail and the stairs at the mall.  He says I'll be better than Matt in no time, and when Chelsea walks by us at the mall and sees my  skills ...bingo!!  Success!!!  I'll be dating her in no time Mike says.  Boy was I worried!!!  I was thinking it was my height, hair color, eyes, clothes, or maybe I was just too ugly for her to notice.  Whew!!!  What a relief.  Mike thinks it's my  skills .  I'll work on my skills like Mike said.  That will do it.  Mike knows everything.  Boy am I glad he's my friend!!  Gotta get to work!!  Peace out.

      Can you believe it???  Chelsea walked right past me like I didn't even exist today!!!!  That's soooo ghetto!!! I thought for sure my new hat would make her notice.  I wore it backwards like Mike said and everything.  I don't get it.  If it's not my hat, then what the heck???!!!  Maybe I'm too tall for her to see the logo way up there.  It can't be my brown hair, she hasn't seen it. I  always  wear a hat.  But Erika told Mike she likes brown hair anyway, and brown eyes.  I got both.  So what then???  I better call Mike later for more advice.  I better make her notice soon, or I'll have another ghetto summer sitting at home with no one to go to the mall or Fun Central with. I better call Mike.  He'll know what to do.  Peace out.

      Hey I got my  Independent  hat!  It was easier than I thought.  I didn't even have to make Dad feel guilty or anything.  Dad is cooler than I thought.  Can't wait to tell Mike.  He'll be shocked!!  Dad said he understood because he used to date girls back in the day, before Mom  captured  him and made him stay at home for the rest of his life. My new hat is soooo cool.  It's black and has the red  Independent  logo on it.  I called Mike and told him I got it.  He said to be sure to wear it backwards, because that's the cool way to wear it, not with the logo in the front like I've been doing.  He says that's ghetto.  He says girls see the cool logo behind you, then they have to look at the front of you to see who's wearing it.  Mike really knows everything, that's why he gets all the cool girls.  I'm glad he's my friend.  I hope this works.  Wish me luck!!!  Peace out.

      Hey my name is Connor.  I'm a skater.  My best friend is Mike.  Mike's soo cool.  He gets all the cool girls.  He's been trying to give me advice.  Right now he's going out with Erika, Chelsea's sister.  I want to go out with Chelsea so bad.  Chelsea's hot. Mike told me Erika said Chelsea only dates skaters who listen to techno music and dress cool.   I've been skateboarding since I was 10, and I wear skater clothes.  I even have Tony Hawk skate videos.  So why does Chelsea just giggle when she walks past me??  I don't get it.  Mike thinks it's my  Element  hat.  He says Chelsea likes  Independent  hats and I should get one.  He says I should get rid of my  Element  hat because it's ghetto, and its making her laugh.  I told Mike I don't have any green right now though.  He says I should try to hit Dad up for $30.00 to get one at the mall today.  He says to tell Dad I really need it, and if that don't work, tell him I  earned  it by mowing the lawn after school. Mike says to make him feel guilty because parents hate that, especially if you  earned  it. That Mike, he knows everything about everything!  I'm glad he's my friend.  I better go work on Dad for some green.   Peace out.
