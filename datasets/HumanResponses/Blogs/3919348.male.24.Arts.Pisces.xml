       Edmonton is a big city of almost one million of people in a very very large area.  It is a city spread very thin, so that it does not feel too tightly packed.  Its most famous attraction is a mall (an arcade of diverse shops) that was largest in the world, and contains thrill-enducing rides that are very fun!  One of the cousins of a friend is employed there as a dolphin, whose job is to chronicle the stories of the mall rats, who are not rats at all but are instead humans of age 11-15 who live at the mall.  Edmonton is also a centre of world culture, with many many festivals and theatres, and a brand spanking new concert hall entitled the Winspear Centre, which contains the symphony and Alice Cooper.  Edmonton is far north (but hot - not cold!) and has the northern lights in the sky, which may be projected from the mall.   Edmonton is not named after anything I recognize.  It has a large river that devides the city into northern and southern hemispheres, each with its own unique history and attractions.  According to the internet sources Edmonton is maybe Canada's most important city, containing the seat of government for the wealthiest of its provinces.  And since Canada is voted one of the most important countries in the earth, this is a big thing!  As yet, I have however not left Alex's house and back-house yard.  This means that I can tell you about his house and yard but not about Edmonton, or about what Alex does when he vacates the house in his bicycle or car.  I must soon find a way to follow him or I will lose my job.  Next time though I will tell you about this very very pleasant and spacious house.

       I was alarmed this evening that has just passed by because Alex went out from the house at 5:30 of the evening on his bicycle (which I heard him say is the same one from Scotland (one year previous from now?) and her name is Kilda) and went to have a sushi with a friend from Toronto who lives here now, always.  This friend was born yesterday and this was a celebration.  I do not know what a sushi is, but it may be expensive.  This is a big celebration!  I knew Alex would then be going to the Fridge festival to see dramatic productions, as he has done every evening this far.  But he did not come home!  I waited in his room and I surfed using the internet too look up some things about Edmonton.  I will tell you these in a next entry to this blog.  Alex came home on foot at 5 of the morning, on this morning!  He was bandaged on the left knee, the right hand and right finger, and was very very tired.  Today he said to the telephone that he was in a bicycle accident when returning from Fridge productions yesterday evening at midnight, when his bicycle hit a piece of road and he fell off of one side, hitting first his left knee and wrist and then his right finger, then hand, then elbow and shoulder.  Then he hit his head, but gently and only on the side of his helmet.  Two nice young members of a couple from a small island near Vancouver Island (this is near here?) were there next to the road that Alex's bicycle hit, and brought him in a van to put his bicycle home and then took him to a hospital, where he waited for a very very very long time to be served.  It is my pleasure to report that he is not badly hurt! - merely bruised on his finger.  He had suspected breakage but no.  Do not worry for him!

       I am now not going to type to you very much because I have spent so much of today lying under the sun, on the hot cement between the back of Alex's house and the garage.  This is an example of where it is good to be able to hide or, barring the door to that, become invisible, because one does not expect leopard geckos to be resting on the cement on the behind of their house in Canada.  I know that leopard geckos are not from Canada, though I do not know where they are from, perhaps though Africa where leopards are from (one of my friends from home is currently a leopard and tells me much of Africa, which I know is bigger than Edmonton).  I do not see why a leopard gecko or any lizard cannot be happy in Edmonton, because Edmonton is very very hot and has long days and much sun.  At the least this is true of Alex's backyard and environs.  I think if I were a human I would have rested on the grass of Alex's backyard, which is sizable, or if I were a large rabbit like the large rabbit that I have seen pass many times, I must say boldly for a rabbit!, though he is very very large, in the alleyway bedhind these houses, I would rest in the garden and also eat.  One of Alex's housegirls tends this garden for him, and grows many things though I do not understand what they are and so I do not know what they are like for eating.        What this means is that from resting in the sun I am tired.  Haven taken the form of a lizard has made me wish to rest in the sun, like a lizard, but I am not truly a lizard, remember.  The sun makes me truly tired.      I know that Alex spent many hours of today inside of his new house.  He must like his house!  Or perhaps he is tired from the journey, or perhaps he is scared of Edmonton and does not wish to see it.  Or so I thought, because at the evening he went on his bicycle (which always until now was on the back of the Volvo and not on the bottoms of his feet) off to a thing that I know now is called the Edmonton Fridge Festival, where (I am making guesses here derived from reading some of Alex's electric mails) there are many humans who have created tragic or comic scenarios about their fridges.  This I do not understand, but it is the second largest such festival in the earth and must be important for humans in Edmonton.  While Alex is gone, I do my typing to you - and I read some of his electric mail!  This is how I learn some things about him.  It is funny that he recieves some mails from his friends and loved humans (I know this because he answers to them) but some mails are from humans he does not know, I think.  I think these are meant for other humans, and not Alex.  Many are actually the same, so it would seem to me that whosoever is sending them is not getting their message through.  There is one telling about a female human who is waiting for "you" (but not Alex, I think) and some are written especially to female humans, which Alex is not, and these might say that women would like to lose inches.  There are also mails saying to male humans they they would like to gain more inches, so I do not understand why the females do not simply give their inches to the males.  I do not think these concern Alex and they must be in error.  I would write to tell this to the humans who send them but Alex must not know about me!        I must say I was a bit ashamed of Alex to find when he went out and I went up to type in his room that so much of his room is not yet orderly.  There are still many many things on the floor!  There is now a bed though which came in the mail today, and a simplified arm chair for Alex's arms.  Alex has two pieces of art on the walls and I know these are his only two from him talking to the telephone.  One is a small simplified female human torso with a head that looks sad and hands that are gesturing to hold someone who is not longer there, and her head has a circle around it that must be a sun.  The other is wiggled swirls of white and yellow on black and blue and makes me dizzy and fall off of Alex's bed from IKEA (is this the Fridge Festival?) but thankfully I am a lizard and light of weight.  I am glad I did not decide to be a heavily bodied creature, like a llama!

       Hello to you the second time, this is again Acky writing to you, on the next day. Acky, the lizard. *wink* (I have read these being said in Alex's electric mails and think them fun). It is okay, you already know this, that I am only in a lizard form so that you can understand me. Again I do not know why it is that it is okay for you to know this, but since it is okay, I do not think that I need to mind saying it again, even many times. You might find this fun: that I am a lizard but also not a lizard. It is funny that it is exactly the same time that it was on the first time that I was writing. This, I do not say that it is a coincidence, as you might say.  I was to tell to you of my journey with Alex to Edmonton from Toronto, which occurred just until yesterday. First, I must tell to you of the fact that I was only assigned to be Alex's documenter very very recently, only just before Alex left on his journey and while he was packing. For this reason I believe that what is important in Alex's life and needs to be recorded has to do with him going to Edmonton, and it is my job, assigned especially to me, to record it. The first thing I can tell you is that Alex took a very long time to become prepared to go to Edmonton. There were many many things in his bedroom of the basement of his parents' house that were spread all over the carpeted floor, and when I came these things were mostly together in piles which maybe only Alex could know to understand. I know from hearing Alex and his mother converse that these things had been in Alex's floor for many days. I could tell that not all things were the things that one would bring on a journey, and then I found that some of these things were being sorted so they would be put away again, in Alex's parents' house. I do not entirely understand this action, except that maybe these were things that Alex wanted still to keep, but not to bring to Edmonton. Before, they were placed in wrong places in storage in the parents' house. Alex brought many things though and it took him and his father most of one day to get things in the car that Alex was to drive. There were many many things fit into that car! Now there are many many things in Alex's new bedroom, even more things than before because he has today been buying furniture, but not yet has his bed been delivered in the mail, so he is sleeping a second night on an inflated cushion from his car. This car was now his, whereas it was before his parents' car. It is a green Volvo, which back home we have also but they are in more complicated shapes (so that we can drive them) and they are not green (there is not green nor colours that you would know) and they are awful, stupid cars, which here on earth is not true at all, since I have so often heard even on this journey that Volvos are regarded enormously highly and are maybe sexy because of this. Alex's Volvo was very very full of things and so I was obliged to rest up in the very back window, on a ledge with some music speakers, where there were not too many things in the way. As a lizard I enjoyed resting for many days in the sun so this was not a problem to me.  I did not know where Edmonton was and I do not still know where it is. I know only that it is far from Toronto! Our journey took us six days of Alex driving, with five nights of resting in buildings (during these times Alex did not drive). This is many days of driving and I can only conclude that Edmonton is many billions of miles from Toronto. We rested first in Iron Bridge, Ontario, where Alex has a friend who was his geography teacher once, but she was not there, but we stayed there in any way. We rested then in hotels in Thunder Bay and Winnipeg, and then with friends of Alex in Regina and Saskatoon. Regina to Saskatoon is not a far drive, only I think a couple of hundred thousand miles and no more and there was no need to rush - but the day from Iron Bridge to Thunder Bay was so long and I never thought we were going to be alive! The road never ceases to twist and turn around. Alex was tired and wanted to be finished with that road. I heard him say though to a friend in Regina that the road before Thunder Bay is beautiful but that beautiful things are often wiggled. Alex was very tired and even seemed to cry a bit on the last hour of travel of that day, but later he said that this was because of a statue named Terry Fox. We saw this statue just before we landed in Thunder Bay. Terry Fox is made of metal and one of his legs has no flesh, and he looks toward the city of Thunder Bay like he would want to get there soon. I do not understand why Alex would cry about this statue, before even seeing it. I do not understand many things, as you are surely understanding! Above all I must admit that I do not truly understand where Edmonton is, and what were these other places we went to first, before Edmonton, and why we had to go through them, even though I was briefed that on earth to go to one place from another place you have to go to places in between. That is what a long journey is like. But I can not understand what it means to be between places, or what it means to go west but to have to go other directions to go west. I kept thinking that there must be more simplified ways of going to Edmonton, or barring the door to this, more simplified places to go than Edmonton. Why does Alex need to journey so far? It is of course my assignment to find it out.  I grow tired of typing. Now that I am here with Alex and you I must type as a lizard types, with the tail, and I grow tired very quickly sometimes. Yesterday and today I have typed a lot of writing to you. From now, I do not know how much I will write nor how often, but I will write this story of Alex to you always when I can, because it is my job to write it. I hope you are finding this fun, like me.

       I should first thing say to you that I have never done this before, and so, I do not know what it will be like for you to read what I write. It is not that I have not written before, which would be to say that I have indeed learned to type, and have been typing for many years, and have used typing to write first simple attempts at excercises for learning to type, short notes and thoughts, and second many letters by now to friends and loved ones, once I had improved my technique sufficiently, and now it is even more improved so that I can type with great agility and precision, and few errors. This of course was first in my own language, and only second in this language which is less familiar with me, but is now much more familiar to me than it was once. If it is not bragging too much to say so, I should like to say that I feel that I have made very very quick improvements both with learning this, a very different language from my own so that I can communicate with some if not all humans, and with typing, which considering I almost entirely use my tail (though sometimes helping feet) I have come to do with great speed. Even not considering - I have seen that I type faster than some humans with ten fingers! Nonetheless it is very very tiring to use a part of my spinal body to type, so I do not expect to write ever very long entries in here unless I am especially moved by a particular incident that I might be documenting, or if I do not mind taking my time and resting my tail at times - I have tried using my tongue at times as a counterpart for my tail in typing and though not so much as agile or strong, it is very quick, and so satisfactory as a temporary substitute.  What I was saying however is that when I say that I have never done this before, as I said at the beginning, I would be saying that it is not that I have not typed before. I have typed plenty, as evidenced by my excellent typing skills which you are reading now! I would be saying that I have not, first, written writing to especially be read by humans, and second, written to tell a story. And not my own story. When I have written letters before by this electric means I written loved ones to tell them of my news of the moments not long before the time that I am writing. This is not so much to tell a story as to keep touch. I do not say to them much about how I feel about what I have done in these moments, I simply say to them what I have done. These are also about me. This is the first time that I have written about someone else, and written a story about them, with many moments, and written to tell this story to other people who I have never met. I do not know what these people want to really hear me say to them. They do not want to know about me, they want to know about Alex about whom I am writing to them. I will have to try my best to tell this story and it will be hard, because this is a story that I do not always understand.  So since you are people who want to read about Alex and his story, I will finish soon to say to you so very very much about me. I am only here to act as a documenter of his story, and I hope to otherwise stay out of the way. I think, though, that I should first tell to you why I am writing to you on the behalf of Alex.  My name is Acky - though it is much more complicated for you if you try to say it in my language, so I suggest that I continue to call myself Acky for you. This is a name that is easy, but fun. I chose it for this reason. It is nice to be able to choose a name, while I did not get to choose my name in my own language. These things are also true for how I would look for you, if you had a chance to see me. In the place where I am from, I am a being that would look too complicated and hard for you to understand, so when I am here among you I have been able to choose what I look like in a form that you would understand, and I chose one that you would recognize and hopefully enjoy: I chose the form of a lizard. I especially chose the form of a leopard gecko, of a purple and white colouration. I may be one of the most beautiful lizards that you have ever seen! Some people collect these geckos but for you if you have never seen one, you would find me strange but enjoyable, and beautiful to look at. I chose also to be a lizard because lizards are small, and very good at hiding.  This will sound strange to you but it is entirely truth: many many of the creatures you see around you are also something else, in another world. Here, they are creatures of earth so you can understand them, because you would not understand them in the forms that they really take. They are also appearing as earth creatures so that they can live here not noticed too much by humans, so that they can do the work for humans that they have to do. We are creatures from a world of creatures who help humans. When we reach especially a certain maturity, we are given a job to do in the world of earth which is to follow a certain human and do two things for them: first, we report on the status of the human, which would be to say if the human is okay or not okay, and second we document what the human is doing. This is very very important to do, because humans so often do not document themselves. It is also a problem that those who do document themselves do not any longer have the time to do the things that they must be doing in their world. So our job is to help them do what they need to be doing but also to record what they do. Every human does things that should be recorded - this is what was decided and so our world was given the order that what our job is to do is to make sure that human lives be written down so that they can be remembered in this way. I do not always know why this is so important and who will read these stories but I do as I am told and trust that this is important for us to do for humans. This is what we do. Not every human has a documenter, but almost all of them do. We documenters look like different earth creatures when we are on earth. I should also say to you that we can also be invisible. Lizards can not realistically go everywhere without being regarded suspiciously!  This is my first assigment to a human - I have only just reached the required maturity. There is one thing that I do not understand though, and hope to have told to me before long - I have a third task, which is to write my record of Alex's story here in electric format, for other humans to read. This means that I am blowing our cover! - humans never, I think, knew about us documenting them. That I have been given this order to write here for humans to see means that this is on purpose, it is decided that humans SHOULD know that they are being documented in this way. I do not know why. This is strange. But there must be a good reason, even if I am never to be told it.  I am tired and have only just arrived in Edmonton with Alex, and I will tell you about our journey soon. I wish you a good night.
