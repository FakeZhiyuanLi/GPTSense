      Today I can take a calmer look at things. I want to write a jazzy piece of music called 'Return of the Panty Cats' and maybe do a gig with a specially made band. So, the song is underway (drums, piano melody but not the changes yet) and the band would depend on the instrumentation of the tune - so that'll be a while.

      This is my first ever Blog entry so I had better make it something special. OK, hello to anyone out there. I'm a bass player and a singer (and a teacher too). This should take you to one of my bands... www.soulbeaver.com  In the coming days, weeks, years I'll write up what is going on and tell you about my life, and the interesting things going on around me. 'Interesting' is a word we'll have to redefine as we go along.

      A further note!  Just to make this worthwhile for you to read, I'm going to add dates for the various bands I play in. Hope that makes things more interesting. No? I can see you shaking your head. Just wait and see.

      Return of the Panty Cats is taking shape in my head - this will only make sense if you read the last post - and this is not an excuse for not having written anything. The tune is swirling around, slowly taking shape, losing the more cliched elements it began with and trying hard not to sound too contrived. All this in my head - no wonder I can't sleep.

      OK, Return of the Panty Cats is a step closer to completion. Quite a small step though. I've become the proud owner of a 16 track digital studio (it needs a name) and have the drums, piano and organ parts for the tune down.  In the last entry I promised details of gigs. Here they are: Sat 21 June - The Chester Arms, Chester Street, off Iffley Road, Oxford. FREE ENTRY. Playing from 8:45   Sat 5th July - Iffleystock @ The Prince Of Wales Iffley, Oxford.   Sat 12 July - The Barn @ The Red Lion - Witney.  £5 entry on the door, doors open @ 10.30pm with a bar 'till 1am.  See http://www.redlionwitney.co.uk

      So, for those of you that want to know, my fab other half and I have  booked our honeymoon but not the wedding. Yet. Since we can't really  call it a honeymoon until we have a wedding I've decided to call it the  holimoon. Part holiday, part honeymoon. Oh, you got that.

      My dad bought an iBook and wanted a BT account like I have. Easy!  Um, no.  BTW. For those of you already on the net (surely all of you) this is a pointless post.  BT and their internet people are a friendly, lovely bunch of folk I'm sure. However, try signing up for an account if you are a Mac user. Especially if you use OSX and browse with Safari.  Bloody nightmare is the phrase that comes to mind. Blocked pop up screens, faulty system problems and limited advice from the rather expensive help desk. Eventually all sorted out but how many times did I consider going with Demon?? Quite a few, that's how many.  Anyway, my beloved dad is now online with BT and everyone is happy.

      Eight weeks to the wedding. I've decided to turn this blog into a wedding countdown area. No wait, that shouldn't be too bad as it is not supposed to be a conventional wedding. There shouldn't be any tales of picking out colours for themed clothing, or who to put on the guest list. We picked only the very closest friends and family, thereby alienating almost everyone else we know. The good news is that we're having a party for the others so they can drop hints about not being invited to the wedding. Anyway, the countdown begins, I still need a job and somewhere for the cat to live while we're away.  Non-wedding news Has anyone else been driven nuts by 'Petals around the rose' recently? The are brain teasers and then there are things like this.  The new project is putting all my Cds onto a separate hard drive to produce Will's Enormous Jukebox. This is a jukebox that, statistically, will probably reward you with some Zappa or Miles Davis. My iTunes library is now up to eight days of music.  OK, I know this is getting nerdy and self-indulgent - but it's my blog for goodness sake!  Current listening: Butch & Butch by the Keith Jarrett trio

      The holimoon saga - booked a holiday which will become a honeymoon when we book the wedding - continues. Received wisdom is that you must book a registry office or church at least a year in advance to have any hope of getting the place, county or indeed country that you want. This is doubly true if you want to get married in the middle of August. Well, fate, blessing or fantastic good luck has intervened and Jenna and I will be getting married in around eight weeks.  Phew!

      Date: 2004-06-13 20:08:33 +0100 Topic: Bob Dylan  I'm slowly getting into Bob Dylan's music. A friend at university had  recommended 'Blood on the tracks' as a starting point. I bought the CD,  listened, didn't like it, put the CD away, turned forty, started  listening to Neil Young, had a chat with a friend about Dylan and  thought "hey, what about 'Blood on the tracks', maybe it's time to  listen again." It was. I love almost all of it. I'll try to find my old vinyl copy of  'Bringing it all back home'.  What worries me is that there might be something genetic about turning  forty and then doing the washing up to Dylan and Neil Young. I'll put  the Wiretapper 11 CD on from this month's Wire (www.thewire.co.uk) magazine to balance  things out.

       &#183;  Since the last post about things sporty Tim Henman has won the first and second sets of his game. In honour of this I am posting some fact about strawberries (taken from the  urlLink BBC Sports site  to give us all a sense of being at Wimbledon and eating overpriced fruit.      &#183;  &nbsp;  Roughly 27,000 kilos of strawberries are eaten during the Wimbledon Championships, together with 7,000 litres of cream. New bellies please!        &#183;  &nbsp; Wimbledon may have 64 seeds in the men's and women's competition, but did you know there are about 200 seeds in every strawberry?       &#183;  &nbsp; A 100g serving of strawberries will serve you for just 50 calories - that's a whooping 0g of fat - Another punnet anyone?       &#183;  &nbsp; We're all smiles - did you know strawberries can help whiten your teeth? The acids in the fruit help to remove stains.       &#183;  &nbsp;    Strawberries are full of a special substance called ellagic acid which can help fight cancers.           &#183;  &nbsp; They are also full of    flavonoids   , which form part of the strawberry's red colour. They are known to help reduce cholesterol from clogging up the heart's arteries.       &#183;  &nbsp;    Eight strawberries have more vitamin C than an orange, that's 140% of our daily recommended amount.           &#183;  &nbsp; The word strawberry comes from the Old English words &quot;   streowberie   &quot; or &quot;   streawbelige   &quot;. There are a few theories about how they got their name. The &quot;straw&quot; bit could come from the straw that was used to keep the strawberries fresh, or it could come from &quot;strewed&quot;, which means to spread wide.       &#183;  &nbsp;    The Latin name for the famous everyday strawberry is  Fragaria Ananassa . We'll just stick to plain old strawberries for now.          &#183;  &nbsp; You cannot be serious! Strawberries can also be white or yellow and some can even taste like pineapples.        &#183;  &nbsp;    The strawberry plant, along with its good mate the raspberry plant, are members of the rose family.           &#183;  &nbsp; The Romans loved their wild strawberries - and not only for their taste. They believed strawberries could cure a number of illnesses.      &#183;  &nbsp;    If you're watching your waistline, why not sprinkle a little black pepper over your strawberries instead of the usual calorific cream? It doesn't sound that appetising, but you'll be pleasantly surprised...

      A terrible night last night. As soon as it became obvious that the England football team were going to face a penalty shootout I should have turned off the television and got back to adding Beatles albums to my enormous jukebox project.  It was certainly a night of contrasts. I sat mute for the last half hour, biting my hand and rocking backwards and forwards like a vegetating animal in a badly maintained zoo. Jenna, in order to bring balance, got in touch with her inner hooligan and enjoyed periods of swearing and dancing around the room in a lively but dangerous fashion.  The cat took great umbrage at our lack of attention in her, even resorting to bringing in a mouse during the penalties. Both survived.  In the non-football world it seems that cake makers and flower arranging people are being readied. I, as you might imagine, have had nothing to do with this. Although, as the countdown continues I am starting to think about how to spend the hours before the ceremony. Squash games, coastal walks and full on panic counseling have been features of friends' pre-wedding hours.  The last thing to comment on today is that the England rugby side are playing Australia and Tim Henman faces a chap called Ivo Heuberger. As I'm writing this the match is in progress, with Tim one game up in the first set (it's 6-5). It seems Tim lost his serve after double faulting in the first set. No tension there then.  Time to get back to work.

            Well obviously I'm not going to be able to keep up a day by day running commentary on how the preparations are going. Who would want to read that? Who (even more importantly) would want to type it?      But, having said that, the meeting with the registrar is booked and the cat has a home for the short time we're away.     Next? A power meeting (serious coffee, find space to sit down in the front room, no distractions) with Jenna on Saturday to work out what we have to do next. I suspect buying the rings will be problematic. Do I really want to spend a lot of money on a ring I'm never going to wear? Can I get away with some rolled up shiny paper on the day?

      Don't panic - it's back! The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is back on Radio 4 - 25 years after it first started. The BBC has officially announced that the sci-fi comedy will return on 21 September for a new six-part series. Most of the original cast - including Simon Jones, Geoffrey McGivern and Mark Wing-Davey - are reunited for the new episodes, which will air as a Hollywood film of the book nears completion.  Even author Douglas Adams will feature in the new radio episodes: he made recordings for a character called Agrajag a few years before his death in 2001. The programmes are based on Adams's last three books: Life, the Universe and Everything; So Long and Thanks for All the Fish; and Mostly Harmless. Another new series is scheduled for broadcast next spring.  A preview can be heard at: www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers

            Less than eight weeks to go to the wedding and nothing is planned. Jenna is trying to arrange a meeting with the registrar... and that's about it. We have the honeymoon booked, that's true. But no home for the cat, no idea what we're wearing, how we get to the place (or even where the place is in my case). Confusion reigns.      What makes all this amusing (to me, if no one else) is that nobody seems to believe we are this badly organised/laid back or that we hadn't secretly arranged things months ago and are only now choosing to tell people.      England play Croatia tonight, that should relieve the stress.       Current listening: the buzz of computer hard drives in the college work room.

      LONDON (Reuters) - A major investment bank is advising clients to have sex, get more sleep and stop equating happiness with money -- turning the industry image of hard-nosed dealmakers on its head.  German-owned Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein offers the advice in a note to clients by its strategist James Montier.  "I thought it was time that I reminded people there was more to life than watching screens every day," he told Reuters.  The note recommends clients have sex, ideally with someone they love, reflect on the good things in life, give their bodies enough sleep and exercise regularly.  But they shouldn't get too carried away.  "I still need a little bit of money just to keep me happy," said Montier.  (From Dave Barry)

      Two fetes in two days. England is gripped with sports fever this week (and next, and the one after that) but this weekend fete-mania has broken out. I went to one in Coleshill, Oxfordshire yesterday. It was at the home George Martin (the nice man who produced some Peter Sellers records) and enjoyed home made produce as well as winning 'The Little Book of Calm'. Today I visited Stanford in the Vale Summer festival (it's a fete really). Fab stalls, won a bottle of fizz and some lovely looking French cider from the town twinning stall. On the way there I heard hymn singing from a small local church and enjoyed the sight of a Ghandi lookalike cooking veggy burgers on a grill in the rain. Someone in Paris said they thought I looked like Ghandi. It's good to return the favour (must change my glassess too).  OK, this does not sound like the blog of an, up-all-night bassplayer/net-nerd. But I love cakes, fetes and... oh, back to the sport...  Current listening: 'Take your clothes off when you dance' - Frank Zappa (from the Lost Episodes CD)

      Only six weeks to go to the wedding. I've decided to abandon the apologetic tone of this blog and will plough on with wedding news safe in the knowledge that some of you find it interesting.  So, today we bought the rings. Mine does not make me invisible (although I can dream) and now resides by the computer. Jenna's is being sized. We also have the post wedding stay over sorted. A posh hotel for the two nights before we get whisked off to Polenta in Italy. OK, it's Positano, but that always make me think of Postman Pat, or Il Postino. Polenta makes me think of food (mmm, food) which is never a bad thing.  I got a little freaked last night watching 'Will & Grace' when Grace got married and discovered she didn't even know her new husband's real name. If Jenna turns out to be a Doris I may take a while to get over it.  Now, the sad tale. Ach! Excuse the pun. Yesterday I saw a fox in front of my car. Obviously injured and unable to move its back legs I was debated whether to get out and wring its neck, or drive over it (I certainly couldn't leave it in this state). Just as I decided to take the cowardly way out and run it over it looked up at me, eyes directly to mine, full of hopelessness and frustration (yes I'm anthropomorphizing). I went to put the car in gear but at that moment the fox dragged itself off the road, using its front legs, and propelled itself into the undergrowth of a field. Looking over the road I saw a woman in her car who had stopped to watch, tears streaming down her face.  Well, I thought, this is a great omen.

            We planned to have our own mini Glastonbury yesterday. Nora Jones was performing at Althorp Park so we bought tickets, made up a picnic and locked ourselves out of the house and car before we even got going.      Thanks to understanding neighbours and help from our landlord's son we were off again after only an hour or two's delay. As it transpired this worked in our favour, as we did not have to spend those hours stuck in a queue of traffic.      Heavy wind and rain tried to put us off, well alright, tried to put me off. The corporate nature of the 'shops in tents' was rather galling too. However, the support - Amos Lee - and Nora with her Handsome Band were excellent.      I was pleased that the live versions of her songs brought out an edge that I hadn't heard on record. Great playing from all concerned and our little candle collection burned brightly through the night.      Getting out was, of course, a nightmare. Hundreds of cars all trying to get out of one exit and an otherwise cheerful and positive crowd showing their grumpy, pushy side. After what could only been a day or two we were back on the road and heading home.      Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

      Today seemed to be the point in the marriage countdown where there guest list threatened to explode in a scary, out of control manner. Jenna and I agonised over this list, keeping it small but feeling pain at excluding so many people we love. However, 'recent developments' have caused the list to be slightly tweezed. Luckily the size of the reception venue has helped us stick to our original plan without offending anyone. There will be at least one post hooneymoon gathering with food, drink and music. Emails will fly when we've sorted that out.  Today I played music in front of a live audience for the first time in months. Great fun. It always is fun to stand in for someone else. You get to experience different arrangements of songs, different songs for that matter, new people and ideas too. Today was no exception. We played blues/rock/soul to a mixed audience, chilling in a field under a mostly blue sky. Two DJ tents, men playing drums, a barbecue with a veggy option and the sound of the Muppet Show album mixed with Zappa's 'Road Ladies'. I only screwed up a few times (playing 'Brick' a semitone out for a whole verse and thinking "boy, someone is really out of tune" untill the horrible truth dawned). The sleeping dogs in the title belonged to the man whose home we were playing at. They slept head to... er, tail during soundcheck then came for a wander about on stage during the otherwise intense climax of the second set. Everyone's a critic.  Home now, it's still light (wierd after a gig) about to have pizza and wine. No stress.  Current listening: One Man Guy - Loudon Wainwright III

      Look at all the changes. Wedding lists have gone out, there isn't much left to do except buy clothes - oh, and find the money to buy them with. Luckily I have two gigs this week: one singing, one as a bassist.  I managed to get back into swimming today. It makes no sense but I already feel as if I've been exercising for weeks, not scarfing low-level comfort food on an all too regular basis.  Next week I face the horrors of a job interview. This time I fully intend to ask plenty of questions to make sure it is the right job for me. Last time I was so pleased to get the job I forgot to check it made sense to take it. I met plenty of great people but ultimately couldn't keep on with it. Rash and stupid are the words that spring to mind when I think of my resigning without a secure job to go to, at 40, just before getting married. Brave is what my lovely friends all say.  And finally, the weather. Today has been one of those typically untypical British days. Cold and cloudy in the morning, with the radio reporting rain that wasn't falling here. I went to the local market town for more paper and diabetic chocolates (for a wedding guest). By the time I was home the sun was out and by four I was roasting. As I look out of the window, Jenna is catching up on sleep and a calm night is slowly descending on the village.  Current listening: Hairless Handle - Piore Z

      Time seems to be speeding up. We had a long shopping trip to a major metropolitan area and returned with some chocolates and a Goodies DVD. So, the wedding clothes are not in our hands, the invitations are not out and the reception still isn't officially booked. Today we went to more local places and sorted out a variety of low level wedding stuff and one very important thing - the wedding ring. Or, to be more specific, Jenna's wedding ring. Mine is still safely sandwiched here on the desk between a Bach box set and a Kent College prospectus. This should also be the week that I get back to playing some bass in front of an audience. I'm sitting in for a nice man called Carl as the bassist in his blues/rock/soul band. I am very keen to get out there and play.  Current listening: Surfacing - Orin Ambarchi & Martin Ng

      The most amazing rainstorm today. I stood in the door of the outhouse with the kitchen CD player outclassed by what felt like rain with something to prove. I was hypnotised by it.  Also, sad news tonight that Sacha Distel had died. My mum was a fan more than I was, but his recent Desert Island Discs was entertaining. Like Johnny Haliday without the embarrassing wardrobe as someone once described him. Spookily, considering I came online to talk about the rain, his big hit here was 'rain drops keep falling on my head.'

      Something I hadn't mentioned before was the music and readings for the ceremony. Or is it a service? Either way civil marriages have come on a bit since the old cash and carry days. We have been asked to provide suitable music and readings for the day. Suitable in this case means 'with no religious connotations whatsoever.' This is harder than it sounds. My best man suggested 'Whole lot of love' by Led Zeppelin. I've been tempted by 'You know my name' by the Beatles. Just a dream. On the way home today I heard a half hour radio programme about Bach's double violin concerto. First movement is all formal communication. Second movement: sexy intimacy. Third movement: Rude interruptions, apologies and talking over each other. Could there be a more perfect piece. When I finally got home I played it through and thought this is it. Then I went back to the Beatles.  Current listening: You know my name... - The Beatles.

          	  Had a great night out last night with David, the best man. The only thing we didn't sort out was what we were going to talk about in our speeches. He had a great idea that we should write each other's. This is certainly a less worrying concept than we cooked up the last time we met. Then there was a suggestion that our speeches should be written (and presented) as if we were preparing them for work. This would mean the best man's speech would be delivered as an account executive' s presentation to potential clients and the groom's would be given as an English lesson. 	  Writing each other's could still be problematic, and anyway, we need to talk about content. Or, more importantly, what to leave out. 	   Last night was fun because we got to go out for Italian food and talk a lot. Then we went on to what his wife (they aren't married but were and look like they might be again so, as Jonathan Richmond once said "I call her wife, because it stops all talk right away.") calls our Nightclub. To me Borders is my second home. Once we've walked the store for interesting books and magazines we settled in for coffee and chess. Three very, very bad games which I am in no way proud of. 	  They did help fuel my project to make a short film though. It's scripted already and I'll make a start after the honeymoon. If nothing else it should give me something to write about once the 'wedding month' has passed and the new job has kicked in. It's going to be about things that remain as constants in your life. One of my constants is this ability to play chess at a frighteningly low level despite all my efforts to read books on improving my game and regularly playing David, the computer and strangers on the internet. 	   BTW, I listened closely to Bob Dylan's 'The Highlands' from 'Time out of Mind' the other day. I admit I was cleaning the bath at the time so may not have been concentrating as fully as I might, but all the same... what a spectacularly unfocussed and dull song. It gave me the impression that he really was making it up as he went along. Maybe I haven't got the hang of Dylan yet. 	  It pails into insignificance when compared to the almost satanic dreck that Borders were playing late last night. Maybe they were trying to get rid of their customers before they had to lock the doors. Maybe a member of staff had had a truly awful day and wanted to take it out on as many people as he or she could. The weapon of choice, for whatever reason, was an early David Bowie track called 'London Boy'. There were several tracks from the same album actually, but they merged into one another. The song(s) sounded as if they came from the 'Laughing Gnome' period but lacked the charm and cunning structure of that now almost forgotten 'hit'. It also reminded me of why so many English people choose to sing as if they are Americans. Bowie's Anthony Newleyesque accent made me want to buy a sweetshop full of lollipops and fire them at the man until he stopped. 	   Current listening: Wild Cat - Joe Venuti &amp; Eddie Lang

         A long night of listening and discussing (polite euphemism) brought us to choosing a combination of Bach, Mussorgsky and Vaughan Williams for the wedding music. Reading supplied by Will Shakespeare and Percy Shelley. 	   Current listening: The most annoying car alarm in the world.

      It's all getting worryingly close now. The big panic this week was when Jenna and I were talking about our two nights in a Gatwick hotel and suddenly questioned whether we were actually flying from Gatwick. It sounds silly but we've been here before, two years ago. I had to make a quick phone call just before we caught a coach to a hotel we, technically, weren't booked into. So,as I said, panic.  While Jenna was away with her sister I had a night on my own. I rented a copy of 'Lost in Translation' which I loved. Direction, cinematography, acting, settings, all came together to make me forget I was watching a film. I'd put it right up there with Three Colours Blue (and White and Red) in the 'if someone held a gun to my head and, for a reason not made clear asked for my favourite films of all time' list.  I am also pleased to report that both the bands I play in rehearsed this week and, even better than that, the 'new song' has been finished and sent off to Radio 2's song-writing contest. This song was a combination of a tune Richard (guitarist, engineer and country gent) had written some time ago and a lyric I supplied. The two went together well but we spent nearly four hours working on the chorus, trying to get just the write combination and sound of words.  Also on a music theme, Jenna and I are getting very close to choosing the wedding music. this is good because it has to be selected and checked by the registrar by ... let me see ... this Saturday. I'd better get back to that.  Current listening: In My Place - Bridge Street.

      What do stag nights mean to you? To me they mean trips to Dublin, waking up tied to lampposts, strippers, waaaaay too much alcohol and excuse for excessive sexism and then paintballing the next day. Very good friends, people I love and admire have done this but somehow gigs or previous appointments have kept me away from the paintballing. Shame. The last stag night I went on was great. I spent hours in a pub discussing Art Deco architecture (I was bluffing, having just been to the Art Deco exhibition at the V&A) and drinking, maybe, at a push two whole pints. The next day was paintballing but I had to be back in Oxford for two gigs. I've been invited to the paintballing party that is Dave (trombonist and sound wizard) from Soul Beaver's but, hey, look at that! I'll be in Italy.  A theme of this wedding is the last minute and, dare I say, half arsed nature of some of the celebrating. I blame only myself for this but the reality is that tomorrow my 'stag do' will take the form of meeting few friends to see a band, have a few drinks and then skulk home.  Jenna's hen night is yet to be sorted out.  Now, on a techy note - despite my strong allegiance to all things  urlLink Apple , I am terrifically impressed by the  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  browser, which allows me to make the blogging experience much less stressful and complicated. It's not as slick looking as  urlLink Safari  but seems more web friendly by several leagues.  Expect pictures from the stag night? Hmmm.  Current listening: End of the Game - Sting

      Time is speeding up, that's for sure.  Had a wonderful rehearsal with  urlLink Soul Beaver  on Tuesday night. We played through new ideas for the set list and throughout the hot and heavy evening played some Led Zep, Joss Stone and who ever did the original version of 'Tainted Love.'  Bridge Street (the other band) has completed its entry for the  urlLink Radio Two songwriting competition . So listen out for 'In My Place' which we're all very proud of.  On the wedding front the pub have sent us a sample menu, which looks wonderful. This is what we're offered...  Crispy Duck Confit with Fig Compote & Crazy Salad Or Asparagus Vinaigrette with Shaved parmesan Or Brochette of Scallops with saffron & Tomato ~~~ Roasted Plum tomato Tatin with Melted Goats Cheese & Avocado Salsa Or Fillet of Scotch Beef with Rosti , Wild Mushrooms  & Two Sauces Or Pastry Puff of Newlyn Fishes with Tomato Butter Sauce ~~~ Terrine of Summer puddings with Clotted Cream Ice Cream Or A Fondant of Valrohna Chocolate with pistachio Ice Cream Or Selection of Farmhouse cheeses ~~~ Coffee with Champagne Truffle   Current listening: You'll see glimpses - Ian Dury and the Blockheads

       urlLink BBC - Proms - Prom Events by Day  Great Prom last night. So much emotion, especially in the Tchaikovsky. I was knocked out by Gidon Kremer's encore after the Shostakovich Violin Concerto. It was, apparently, 'Aurora' by Eugene Ysaye.

      Three pints of Guiness, lame rapping and some energetic ska, not to mention the company of friends. That was the 'stag night'. The lame rapping wasn't me by the way, it was the support to the Drug Squad, who played original ska music until the early hours. The best man wasn't feeling well so he missed out. I very nearly missed out too after a long day's shopping in Oxford (very hot, so many people). I wish I'd had the camera with me during the day as town was buzzing with music, colour and every accent from around the world.  For anyone interested, I can't seem to make the 'Government Bans Smiling' link work. The story was about new regulations on British Passport photographs. No more smiling, it seems. Have you known anyone who did smile in their passport picture though?
