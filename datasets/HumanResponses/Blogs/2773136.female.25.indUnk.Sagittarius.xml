      I have so many projects in my queue right now that it is ridiculous. Anyway, I finished Mike's scarf last night and he loves it. I love it too because although it was extremely simple to make, it looks so much nicer than the stripey mess that he had been wearing previously.   Right now, I am in the middle of working on an i-cord scarf for myself in all different shades and textures of blue yarn to match the blue suede coat that I have. I'm about half finished with it already and it has inspired me to create something else out of this really beautiful deep teal yarn that I picked up the other day.   So... With the teal yarn, I am going to be making a cardican completely out of i-cords. I'm really excited about this and I'm going to start it immediately after finishing the i-cord scarf. The i-cord frenzy that I seem to be in has also inspired me to frog the cat paw lace shawl that I finished last month so that I can make an i-cord shawl out of the yarn instead. THIS IS SO EXCITING! If the cardigan (and the shawl) come out the way I picture them in my head, I want to make a 3/4 duster out of some really fluffly black variegated yarn.   Notice how I keep adding more and more to the "to do" list? Yeah. Its amazing that I get anything completed. :)

      That MD Scarf is insanely quick to knit. Its already at 50" in length and I haven't even been devoting all my time to it. Everyone is going to get one of these for Christmas this year since I could definitaly knit one up in a day, given I have no other responsibilities to take care of.   Anyway, on to shopping updates! Yesterday I picked up these really beautiful variegated rose colored glass beads that I am going to work into the wrap that I want to wear on Valentine's Day. I'm so excited about this because I really think the beads are going to make the wrap look A+. I also picked up a soft pink skein of yarn that I am thinking about working into the wrap, but I don't really know if I will be... The softer pink may appear to be too little girl pink for my taste in comparison with the other colors that I already have worked into the wrap. I'm thinking that perhaps I will do only one row randomly knit with the pale pink to break it up a bit, or I'll make a pair of mittens or something out of it.   I should really take pictures of all these things. Essentially, I have so much going on, and so little to show for it online.

      I feel really bad because my boyfriend wears the very first thing I ever completed when I started knitting -- a 12 inch wide dark and medium blue garter stitch scarf that is slightly too short.  At the time, I was immensely proud of it. But now, I'm a little bit ashamed! It totally sucks compared to what I am capable of doing NOW! Don't get me wrong, he loves it... but I only half love it. Yesterday he mentioned that one of his buddies at work saw the scarf and asked if I made it. Mike said that I did and then WENT AND POINTED OUT FLAWS IN IT and they both had a laugh.   har har har. Very funny.  Well, I can't send him out wearing silly things that I made when I first started knitting, so I started a new scarf for him. It is the Multidirectional Diagonal Scarf from http://www.threadbearfiberarts.com. I started it last night and it is 15" long so far (I'm shooting for a good sized five footer on this one).   On top of that, I've also started working out another thing that I am going to be starting once the MD Scarf is completed.  So, what does that make -- 8 projects that I will have in progress? :)  I'll update this with pictures soon... but I've got to get some more knitting done first!

      Here is how I make hats using only straight needles. No DPN's or circulars are involved! I based the "generic hat pattern" on  urlLink Rita Taylor's beret pattern  from about dot com. This pattern is written to be used with 4-ply worsted weight acrylic yarn, however it can be adjusted to utilize any type of yarn or size. Just use your noodle. :)   R1: Cast on 5 stitches. R2 & All Even Rows: Purl R3: Knit, increasing in each stitch except the last one. (9 sts) R5: Knit, increasing in each stitch except the last one. (17 sts) R7: Knit, increasing in each stitch except the last one. (33 sts -- If knitting for a baby, stop increasing here.) R9: *K1, inc in next st* (49 sts -- If knitting for a younger toddler, stop increasing here.) R11: *K2, inc in next st* (65 sts -- If knitting for an older child, grade school perhaps, stop increasing here.) R13: Knit. Do not increase in any stitches. R15: *K3, inc in next st* (81 sts -- Stop increasing here if you are making an adult sized hat.)  R16: It is at this point where you can adjust to either increase or decrease the number of stitches on your needle to fit whatever stitch pattern you choose to use for the hat. For example, lets say that you decide that you want to knit your hat with the tulip lace pattern from Vogue Knitting's Ultimate Knitting Book. The lace pattern states that the st patt requires a multiple of 8 stitches. Since you have 81 stitches on the needle, purl 2 together to decrease by one stitch on your needles so that you are working with 80 stitches instead of 81. For a basic hat, I like to do a simple k1p1 rib throughout the hat. Therefore, I increase in the first stitch in this row, and then k1p1 back as normal, because k1p1 rib requires an even number of stitches.   R17-?: Knit in your pattern until you have reached your desired length. If you like the "scully" style hats, bind off in rib (or in your pattern) when you reach 8 inches. If you like the kind of hat that has a three inch folded back brim, bind off when you reach 11 inches. These measurements are for adult sized hats. Use your judgement when knitting to the appropriate length for a child's hat.

      of yarn, that is!  I tried doing this on LiveJournal, however it just wasn't working for me. So... I'm here!   (And since I'm still working on this, it might suck for a bit. Keep checking. Pictures and updates will be happening all the time!)

      Well, anyone who reads this or who knows me in person knows that I always have about a million projects going on all at the same time. Maybe it is because I have such a short attention span, or maybe it is because I like to see all the different things I can accomplish using different techniques. Or, maybe it is just because I would rather have things in progress than have things completed. I know. I've got issues, and I'm okay with that. However, there are things that I  need  to complete by specific dates regardless of what completion issues I have. Two of these "things" are what I like to call "package deals". A package deal is something that contains more than one knitted piece that goes together. Like a set. The two other things have nothing to do with each other, as the recipient for each thing is not the same person. They are not package deals, but instead are singular items. All of these things must be completed within the next few upcoming weeks, so they are going to be all that I work on until they are all completed. Every other project will be put on hold. The funny thing about these projects, and the fact that I am mentioning them on a knitting blog, is that I absolutely cannot post photographs or scans of these items, nor can I post descriptions of them just in case one of the recipients of these items comes across this blog. And, that wouldn't be unheard of considering that in the signature of each email I send, there is a link to this blog. Go me. Anyway, these gift items will be called:  Package 1M ,  Package 2P ,  Item 1S , and  Item 2R . I'll post detailed descriptions and photographs/scans once the recipient receives the items so I do not run the risk of ruining a great surprise. Most of the descriptions/photographs/scans will be able to be posted before the end of April/beginning of May.  This is an update on the works in progess thus far:   Package 1M  This has been a really fun package to create and is serving as a source of inspiration for all future packages. It actually inspired me so much that I frogged an item from the other package that I had been working on so I can replicate what I have done with this one. My original intention for this recipient was quite different than it is now, mainly because I did not have an appropriate source of inspiration. And, that was sad, really, because I wanted to do something spectacular, but just couldn't come up with ideas that made me go "Whooo!" instead of "Ho Hum". Thursday night,  before the Stitch 'n Bitch, Anne and I went to Wal-mart to pick up a skein of yarn so she could work on her first project following a pattern that was not a scarf. I decided that it might be more helpful for her (and for me if I was to help her) if I did the same project also. Needless to say, the project was TERRIBLE. Neither of us got any more than an inch done during the SnB (I've noticed I do a lot more "bitching" than I do "stitching" at those things!!!), so I did some of the project when I got home and deemed it a failure. Can you say "wonky"? (Note to self: Never follow a pattern that has no picture -- pictures REALLY are helpful. Also, " you get what you pay for". Yeah.)  Now, I was left with a full skein of yarn that could be used for one purpose only. It was bought with the intentions of making a gift for this person, and that was just what I was going to do. By 2 AM, I had already completed approximately 5/8 of item #1 for this project. I did absolutely  no knitting  on Friday, which was a little odd for me. On Saturday, I completed the rest of item #1, as well as item #2 for this package. I found a tertiary pattern (with a picture) for the item(s) that Anne and I were to originally knit, and determined that I still had more than enough yarn to complete the item(s) from the original idea. I also knew that this/these item(s) would take virtually no time at all and that I would like to work on another item for this package. I played around with my yarn a little bit using different stitch patterns and needle sizes, and then it hit me. I knew what I was going to do, and I'm  very  proud of it. It actually pains me that I cannot go into any more detail about it here -- that's how proud of it I am. I now have nine inches (1/6 th) of this inspirational item completed. I am definitaly going to bring the items that I have both completed and have in progress to this upcoming SnB so I can get a better gauge on whether or not I'm just loopy, or if these items are adorable.   Package 2P  I started this package as one singular item about two and a half months ago. For two and a half months, the first four inches from the day I cast on sat on my circulars wasting space and my utilities. The pattern I originally came up with for this particular item, although very beautiful and meaningful, was a little too complex and I knew that the intended recipient would not appreciate the involvement that went into it. I talked about this item briefly at the last SnB, where I pretty much convinced myself that I should frog it and start anew. The only problem was -- what would I create in its place? This problem was solved last night during the creation of the item I am very proud of from Package 1M. I happily frogged that bad boy and began doing a replication of the inspirational item, but in a different style. Again, I wish I could go into more of a description here, but I can't. This new version of the item has also freed up an entire skein of yarn intended for the recipient so I can do a complete package, similar to what is going to be in Package 1M. I am  so  excited about this!!!   Item 1S  I have not started this item yet, although I keep gathering ideas. I know what the item will be, but I don't know its details yet as far as stitch patterns and colors go. I will probably start this project within the next week and a half though because I'm  really close  to figuring out all the details.   Item 2R  I know EXACTLY what I am doing for this, except I have not started it yet, and its probably because I am overly optimistic as to the outcome of the knitted piece. I charted it myself, and came up with the pattern details and although I was VERY confident when I completed both of these details (and the several times almost immediately after when I checked and rechecked my work), I am starting to feel uneasy about the details. I'll probably check them over once more (or twice more) before I start this on Wednesday.   ... One thing I really need to figure out how to do is to get some sort of progress chart and WIP listing directly onto this blog, instead of linking to the livejournal account. No offense to livejournal users or anything (since I am one myself), but this whole linking nonsence is a bit annoying. And, updating each WIP is annoying. So, I don't know if anyone even noticed, but my WIPs and Completed Objects links have not been updated in a while now. *sigh* I need to set aside some time to work on those things, but I'd really rather be knitting. Its a no win situation! :)  In other news, I had SO MUCH FUN at the last Stitch n Bitch. SO MUCH FUN. It felt like a completely different experience than the one I had the week prior because while I felt VERY drained after the first meet-up, I felt  energized  after this last one. I loved the energy this week, and I hope that I'm not the only one who felt that positivity. It was probably there during the first one, but I was so freaked out that people would hate it or each other that I did nothing but panic about it for at least a week. I finally got to meet Katie, who I absolutely ADORE, and she's one of the most interesting people I've met in a long time. She makes me feel less self-conscious about myself and the way I do things. Particuarly the way I do things in mass quantities and with no moderation, burn myself out, moderate myself, then move on to something else to include in my repertoire. I got virtually no knitting done, again, but I had so much fun so it doesn't even matter. Anne learned to purl, Tina loves the Bloodhound Gang (me too!!!), and we were all in agreement that the hair of the man providing the live entertainment was probably the worst hair to ever be seen in public with. It was great. I'm really looking forward to the next meet-up and I'm so happy this thing is coming together the way it has been.  Back to my knitting!!!  :)

      Of course I'm excited, but I'm going to try to keep my high level of enthusiasm to a minimum. I recently watched a couple of interviews with Drew Barrymore and apparently, she scares people with her enthusiasm. So, Drew, if you are reading this -- I feel ya, I really do. One thing that I'm really excited about is that Anne came to me and wants to make something that requires a pattern -- baby booties. I figured that this would be her first pattern, I would help her out. And then I figured that since everyone I know is popping out children, I should make them along with her. So I guess that means that I'm doing a knit along with Anne, sort of. I plan to have these things done by the time I leave that cafe tonight, although I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen because I'll end up people watching, talking, or eating instead... or something. Oh well. The group this week has also been downsized from last week's group. Last week, nine. This week, six. Or seven, depending on whether or not Sami stops by. And, Katie might come by tonight, which is awesome because I haven't met her yet.   I've decided to take a break from frogging the sweaters I bought yesterday. This one sweater, when unraveled, looks identical to Omelette's fur. Omelette is one of my cats -- a long haired calico. These huge wads of yarn could seriously be mistaken for the largest, creepiest hairballs ever.   Anyway, on to some other news. I made a few sets of knitting needles yesterday, and this one set I made is already my favorite so I think I need to make more in the same size, etc. I always tend to use the same sized needles for everything, and to be able to have duplicates of my favorites would be nice. Plus, these babies cost me under two bucks per set. Not bad at all for needles of their diameter.  I've noticed that I have gone through some knitting needle phases. First, I loved US 7's. Loved them! Couldn't get enough of them. Couldn't stop making everything with them. Then, I found that I loved US 5's even better. And guess what came next? US 3's. For a long time, I had myself convinced that the 7's were actually quite large and that I could make anything using them. Then I discovered US 10's. I thought these things were the queen bee's of knitting needles. Then I used US 17's. Now, you've got to understand -- 17's are an obnoxious needle size for someone who used nothing greater than a US 5 for almost a year. The needles that I made last night are probably about a US 13 or so. I consider them my happy meduim because the 17's were just too much for me. Deb, from the knitting group, was trying to tell me about these size 30-something needles last week during the meet up. My eyes were probably about as large as an eyelet made with size 30-something needles when she was telling me. Wish I had pictures of that.  I've been getting a lot of knitting done, although since the work has been spread out on more than one project, it really doesn't look like much. I gave the cabled sweater a rest for a little while, and I haven't picked it back up yet. I think the knitting and frogged episode that I went through last weekend took a toll on my enthusiasm for that project. For future projects, I am going to be less indecisive about the yarn I use for projects like that. I did start this very bright, almost day-glo, summer wrap for myself. I was inspired by this beautiful silk Lilly Pulitzer scarf I got for breast cancer awareness, as well as afghans and throws for the late sixties/early 70s. I've got about 10 inches of it completed and it looks beautiful -- very spring-like. Another project that I started is the feather and fan wrap using my teal yarn. This project is on my latest favorite needles, and I've got maybe 7 inches or so completed. I also charted a scottie dog for both regular and illusion knitting, and cast on for a scarf that I wanted to make using it. I didn't particuarly like it (the scarf, not the pattern), so I only have about 2 inches completed on it. I'll probably end up frogging it. I also scored two sweaters very cheap that I am unraveling for another shawl or wrap that I want to make. I still have a lot of work to do on Dana's baby blanket, as well as a toddler blanket for Evan. So much knitting to do, so little time... although I *really* can't use that as an excuse.

      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/morriswarrennjsnb/surveys?id=459399  There is a poll that was created to gauge how well we picked the meet-up location in our Yahoo Groups forum. It's really a quick poll - yes/no to one question - but its very important that members who were in attendance answer it. So far, only four people out of the nine who attended, have voted, and the voting ends today at 4 PM. I'm not sure if people actually READ this blog, but I figured that outside of the post I made and the special notice that I sent out yesterday from Yahoo Groups, I really can't put this anywhere else... I don't think the Knitting Community would be pleased if I posted it there! :)

      I have yarn commitment issues. I'm sure of it. Its probably one of the major reasons I don't want to purchase higher priced yarn -- I'll love it and leave it just like the rest. *sigh*  Well, the story goes like this.  I started making the cardigan (v1.0) using Yarn A. I completed, oh say, 8.25" of the back using Yarn A, and I decided that I would rather make said cardigan using Yarn B. Well, dandy! I just frogged that bad boy early Friday afternoon and I started making the cardigan (v2.0) using Yarn B. I cast on, knit several inches, frogged it, cast on, knit a couple inches, frogged it, had a slight hissy fit about why the hell I can't just pick a yarn and go with it, cast on, decide to start with the ribbing instead of the body, hate it and frog it. This went on late into Saturday evening.  Seriously. I have the most dysfunctional relationship with my yarn. I should seek therapy.  Of course, this whole cast on ("cast on... *click click*... cast off... *click click*-- the caster!") cast off phase I went through took a toll on me, as it took up a lot of time unnecessarily and it drained my creative soul. I couldn't even sleep because I was going through one of those must-think-about-knitting-can't-sleep-yarn-will-tie-itself-into-knots-if-I-do-sleep phases. I ended up falling asleep at (and keeping Mike up until) a little after 3:30 in the morning.   I must have had a yarn therapy session in my sleep because I woke up with the greatest ideas, in my opinion, for projects that I want to work on.    And to bring up Stitch n Bitch, I think it was fairly successful. Unfortunately, school was out that week and it was VERY busy (and smokey, and loud) as a result. I've gotten confirmation from several people that the shop is not actually like that on your typical Thursday, so the group probably was not as impressed with it as I was. In fact, they probably think that I was smoking crack when I said it was the perfect place to meet up.  I swear on Elann.com, you guys -- only the back room that was seperated by little curtains had a few people in it, and four people were in the rest of the place! It wasn't loud, smokey, OR busy!  Hopefully people will keep coming back, because overall, it was a lot of fun and it was a nice way to meet some new people. And, hopefully, new people will be joining us as well. I read somewhere where someone said that it could take months for a knitting group to get up to 5 members who meet. We started with nine. We would have started with twelve, but two were at a concert and one was ill. That's not bad for a first meet-up, right? Plus, we are finally "official" and listed on the www.stitchnbitch.org website. Hopefully we will get more traffic now, because it would be great to have a really large and diverse group. Everyone who showed up was so nice, and everyone's projects were so beautiful and cushy. It was a really great atmosphere -- very creatively charged. Unfortunately, I remember everyone's name and face except for one person because I couldn't hear her (I'm sorry!). She was working on Zeeby's Bag from the Stitch 'n Bitch book, and she was Tina's friend. She had an AWESOME hat on, which of course was one of the first things I noticed because I have a sick infatuation with hats. I want to make sure I get her name the next time I see her because I feel like a tart for not remembering it (or hearing it?) now.  Anyway, on a non-knitting side note, I have felt so drained since Thursday. In fact, on Friday I was practically useless. I know it sounds like such a sin to blame being introverted for this, but its so true. I hope I get into the swing of things soon. For some STRANGE reason, it never dawned on me that trying to lead/get together/organize a group of 15 would be draining. Which, really, is just unheard of for me to not think of. Ask Anne. I remind her all about introvert traits all the time just to make sure she doesn't think I'm crazy. Although, now that I think of it, reminding her that I am an introvert and not crazy probably makes her think that I *am* crazy. Its a no win situation!   On Sunday, Mike and I ended up going down to Toms River to celebrate his parents' birthdays. I was to make the surprise dinner AND desert. You know, I totally don't mind doing that kind of stuff at all -- in fact, I thrive on it -- but for some reason, I had such PERFORMANCE ANXIETY that I felt like I was going to bust apart at the seams. I'm sure it had NOTHING at all to do with the fact that I was working on very little sleep and that I was still emotionally exhausted from Thursday!!! I ended up making an Eli's style cheesecake from scratch that came out so absolutely delicious, tall, and light (mind you, nothing about the ingredients in this cheesecake were  light  or  low  in anything by any means) that I'm doing nothing but craving it. I also made my special pork chops (pan seared over high heat, then poached (?) in a cranberry balsamic garlic sauce until they are done. BEST PORK CHOPS EVER. Everyone loved them and there were no leftovers, which totally shocked me because I made A LOT of food. It was enjoyable and I'm glad everyone had a good time.   And, speaking of food -- am I the only one who LOVES pizza with pepperoni and pineapples?

      In fact, it probably has more to do with linguistics! But anyway. Last night Mike and I were going through the McDonald's drive thru (ever just CRAVE the fries?) and we were talking about his work, and I starting comparing his work ethic to my work ethic (although I don't work anymore, I still have one) and I told him that he is the shiz-nit at VZW, and I am just the  shiz-knitter . He wanted me to make sure that I get "props" (yo) for coining that term.   So there ya go folks. A whole new term, courtesy of yours truly.    SHIZ-KNITTER Pronunciation: shizz 'nit ter Function: noun Etymology: Urban term  shiznit , Middle English  knitten , from Old English  cnyttan ; akin to Old English  cnotta  knot.  Definition: One who knits, and who is also awesome. Used in a sentence:  Nicole is such a shiz-knitter.

      Anne and I generally exchange details of our lives, sarcasms, and inside jokes every work day (Monday through Friday). If one of us has not heard from the other by around 10:30 AM, it is cause for small spread panic between us in most cases. Although I don't actually speak with Anne over the phone very often (WHY IS THAT??? Oh wait. I remember that cell phone bill!!!), she is the person I communicate with the most during the day. We did, at one point, attempt to converse over text messages, but that in itself is a whole other story.   So, today, I brainstormed ways to make sure that the people who are coming to the first meet-up know that I am the one they should be looking for.  I write this to Anne:  "I was thinking of  making a hat that has my name on it  so I could wear it  tomorrow  so  people who don't know who I am  (everyone but you)  would be able to spot me . What do you think?"   Anne replies:  "if you want to wear a hat with your name on it, go ahead. but  i think the yarn and knitting needles will give away who you are ."   Yes, yes... Anne is my source of everyday common sense. But needless to say, I'm still making that damn hat.

      I just got around to reading the Winter 2003/2004 Issue of Vogue Knitting. Had I known that the magazine was going to inspire me in such a way, I would not have picked it up until everything I should be completing has been finished. Oops. You know that Oscar de la Renta cable stitch pattern? (Yeah, I know its not totally original or anything, but SHHHH! It still sparked my imagination.) Well, its my new favorite thing to knit, and I started another (!!!) project at 10 PM on Valentine's Day. I've got three inches of it completed so far, and its coming along nicely. I'm designing it after this green bobble off-center cardigan with closure flaps on the turtleneck and waist that I saw in a Victoria's Secret catalog over the winter. Its pretty damn cool (well, at least I think so) and I'm going to be working on it during Thursday's meet-up.   And yes. I know. Pictures. Post 'em. No kidding. I will. Eventually. Soon. Because I know how boring a knitting blog is without pictures to look at, regardless of the other content.

      Best Graphics Ever.  *Use them if you'd like, but save them, then upload them to your own webspace first.           And as a knitting side note, I added beads to the wrap, then made a matching hat. Go me.

      I have been so full of puns lately that its embarressing. Everything from "I was in STITCHES" to "tight knit group" to "its a wrap" to "the skein of my teeth". I should really be banned from speaking -- and thinking out loud!   Okie dokie. So, I finished the body portion of the wrap, and it measures about 90 inches long (!!!) and about 32 inches wide. I realize that it is a little large for a wrap, but whatever. I'm just going to call it my "extreme wrap". Originaly, my plan was to incorporate i-cords as the fringe coming off the wrap, and I started doing that and discovered that I totally don't like it. Thank God for that too, because I would be here for six years (even though i-cords don't take long to make) if I continued with the plan. Now I'm just doing regular old fringe and I'm going to be adding the beading to the sides, borders, and yarn overs later. The term "later" obviously means as soon as possible since I don't want to be working on this the night before Valentines Day. IN FACT... My plan right now is to have this finished tonight so that I can make a matching hat to go with it.   Once this gets finished though, its back to the sage green sweater.   And yeah, I know. There are still no pictures of my work online. I'll get to that as soon as I take a break from actually knitting.

      Alright, so I didn't upload those pictures yet. Sue me! Its the weekend. These things happen. Its a little embarressing knowing that my blatent laziness for not doing this is being broadcast all over the web now by whoever reads this, but... oh well. I've been really busy knitting! I promise. That should at least count for something. Today I reached the halfway mark of the Valentines Day Wrap. It measures a whopping 42 inches now from the beginning to the center point.  I really shouldn't even be online right now because I need to get the main portion of the wrap completed so I can add fringe and beading, but I'm looking at rings online instead.   Also, tonight, two more people expressed interest in joining the Morris-Warren NJ SnB!!! This is SO EXCITING!!! I'm so glad I signed online to check out rings otherwise I wouldn't have even acknowledged the two gals until MONDAY, and that would have just been rude... I guess I should make it known to people that I rarely sign online on the weekends? I dunno. But anyway, one of the gals lives up around my neck of the woods, so I'm really excited about that. Hopefully, now that there are more people interested in the group, it will start moving along a little more smoothly. For a while there, I started to feel as though I was posting and responding to myself, lol.   On a side note, I'm starting to think of ways to incorporate my knitting into the wedding that I will eventually be having. I've pretty much ruled out knitting a dress for myself. I'm pretty insane, but not THAT insane. However, tonight, there I was, having a blast knitting up my wrap and looking forward to knitting up the teal one almost as soon as I am finished with this one. And that's when it hit me. I'm going to knit myself a wrap -- out of some alpaca/silk blend yarn this time, not acrylic -- for the wedding. And... Da da dum. I'm also going to knit myself the bag that I will carry on that day too. I figure, if I can't make the dress, I can at least make the accessories. Its funny how this is probably the obvious decision for any sane person, but for me, it took a LONG time to get to this point in my thinking. For instance, I went from wanting to make my own wedding cake, to just baking the cucidati to serve with the coffee/tea, to finally just realizing that perhaps if I just include one of my recipes or something like that in the wedding favors that I would be saving myself a lot of time, effort and stress that can be directed towards other matters of the occassion.   You know, it would be REALLLY nice to be able to say, "Please come to my wedding. I have done all the catering from the wine to the five course meals to the cake and cookies, and I've also designed and fabricated the entire bridal party's attire as well as my gown. RSVP by blah blah blah," without people automatically institutionalizing me.  Okay, I'm signing offline now. I have a lot of knitting to do (42 inches in body, many i-cords, and beading) and this whole online thing has served as a tool of procrastination long enough. :)  But one last thing... If you haven't seen the movie  Avalon  yet, please rent it. Its so amazing.  Oh. And another last thing. Mike and I decided to check out the Clinton Station Diner for dinner tonight (since we have already tested out their breakfast selection) and the wait for a table was AN HOUR AND A HALF. WTF??????????????

       Project Update:    I completed A LOT of my replica of the Vogue Knitting Holiday Knits 2k3 Wrap. It looks pretty and it will look even better when I add the beading. I decided to "cheat" a little with the beading. Originally, I wanted to knit with beads (bead knitting? i.e., string beads onto the yarn first and then knit, etc) but I'm lazy. Sue me.   I also am about 10 rows short of finishing the back of my sage green sweater.  I re-located a minty green sweater that I got from Target years ago. Unfortunately, the sweater shrunk a bit years ago so I'm going to frog it. Its a lambswool/angora/nylon blend and I'm excited to make something (anything) out of it. This will be the first recycled sweater project that I will do.  I came up with a few ideas to make a bag out of some of the Lions Brand Wool Ease Thick and Quick (in white? cream? aran? whatever) that I have. Originally, I was going to make a sweater out of it, then I discovered that I don't like wearing bulky knits because they add mass to places I'd rather not add mass to on my body. Then, I was going to do a pretty poncho. I started it, then stopped. Then I knit one similar to the red one I made, but on the wrong sized needles. Needless to say, I plan on frogging that one. Eventually, after I finished scowling at the yarn, I thought I would knit a wrap out of it. However, the chances of me wearing such a heavy wrap on a wrap weather day are pretty slim. Today, I decided I would make a bag that is somewhat similiar to the bags that the gap has in their stores right now. No pattern for this yet, just a thought.  I'm pretty sure I worked on a few more pieces and ideas, but I'm a bit tired right now and I can't recall anything other than what's already mentioned.   Picture Update:  This evening, I took approximately 40 (!!!) pictures of pieces I have either on needles, or pieces I have completed that I have not given away as gifts.   When I browsed back through some of the pictures that were still on the digicam, I uncovered pictures of Anne knitting (whoo hoo), as well as some gifts I made for a baby (teddy bears and a blanket). How exciting! At least, for me anyway. I was planning on updating this thing with the pictures, but the software for the digicam is on the computer, and I'm on the laptop because Mike is using the computer to do our taxes. There will be pictures on here tomorrow. No joke. :)   Mouse Update  "F that rodent."

      Well, I sure as hell don't know where mine is. I fear this two inch beast that taunts me from my kitchen, so I don't want to go to sleep until Mike gets back at 6 AM  from doing some crazy change control for work. Stupid mouse. Anyway, I figured I would do a small update on the progress of my WIPs.   The wrap that is my version of Vogue Knitting's wrap from Holiday Knits 2k3 is about 13 inches long.   The sage green sweater back is 12 inches long.  I started, frogged, started, then frogged the teal wrap because I've been playing around with needle sizes. Had I not been so indecisive, this wrap would also measure a cool 9 inches.  No progress was made on the other fifty gazillion projects that I have hanging out on needles.   You know, its always so impressive to me when I hear that a fellow knitter is working on only one thing at a time. That's just so foreign to me and requires a certain degree of self control that I seem to lack. In all honesty, I don't believe that I am the kind of knitter that just wants to get things completed. I just like working on things. I know, I know -- who doesn't love finished projects? I don't. The sense of completion is not a cause for celebration for me. I find that I get way more enjoyment and a better sense of accomplishment out of having something on the needles at all times, even if it never gets finished, as long as I am working on it.   Maybe I'm a little odd, or maybe its the fact that it is a quarter to 5 in the morning.    Sidenote: Started taking pictures tonight; Feared that my lack of sleep would cause me to unintentionally pull a piece off its needle and decided to stop. Pictures of my work will happen soon enough (tomorrow maybe?), so enjoy a couple pictures of Corny. The second one is my absolute favorite. He is kissing the camera as I took the picture. Awwwww.

      I can get comments now thanks to HaloScan.  This is almost like a REAL blog now! Oh joy. :)  Oh, and by the way -- that whole mouse thing, its still going on.   You would think that having three cats would be a sure fire cure to this problem, but nooooooooooo! *sigh* Alas, they are more interested in the food used to lure the mouse into the humane traps than the actual mouse itself.

      Well, after careful planning and calculation, I have determined that I do not have quite enough of the teal yarn to make the cardigan that I was going to start. I do, however, have more than enough of the same kind of yarn -- but in sage green. Sooooo... I started the sage green cardie (my pattern) last night and I already have 10 inches of the back completed on size US 6 needles. I would have had more done, but the Superbowl was on, plus Mike and I discovered an uninvited guest in the house -- A MOUSE!!! Its cute. I want to keep it, but know better than to try to contain wild creatures. We are trying to remove it humanely from our home with humane mouse traps. Sidenote: Mice prefer pepperoni over cheese and peanut butter.   I decided that I will in fact plug on forward with the i-cord cardigan, but since I don't have enough yarn (i.e. not even enough for a standard knit cardigan), I will be using a few (huge) balls of Lion Brand Pound of Love instead.   Now, what to do with the teal yarn. I'm going to make a feather and fan stitch wrap out of it. I could always use another and I spotted some really nice glass beads at Michaels that would match it perfectly. :)  I think I'm going to start taking pictures of my work tonight... Expect updates!

      I posted this to  urlLink the knitting group's messageboard , but I thought it might be good to post it here too, especially since I've been such a  urlLink slacker  when it has come to  urlLink knitting  and  urlLink updating this blog  lately.  Basically, what it comes down to is that I have  urlLink issues  about working in  urlLink plain stockinette stitch .    Lately, I have noticed that it takes me far longer than necessary to complete pieces that are to be done in plain, one color, stockinette stitch. I breeze through color work and cables... Hell, I even breeze through some lace. But, the problem is that I get so bored with st st that it takes me roughly three times as long to complete a project that uses it than it would if the project was full of cables and eyelets.  For instance, I'm working on this item where one side is gingham and the other is st st. I started and completed the gingham side in roughly 8 knitting hours total. However, it is now taking me three to four weeks (with practically no knitting hours because I have no interest in the st st) to get more than a few inches worked on the stockinette stitch side. Normally, this wouldn't be much of a problem, except the the item is to be given as a gift in April.  Am I hitting some sort of stockinette stitch rut that is well known among other knitters, or is this something unique and quirky that I've managed to get into all by myself?  - Nicole, who is  hopelessly bored  of plain stockinette stich.

      I feel like I should be wearing  urlLink a witness protection disguise  right now. I am about to admit something heinous. Over the weekend, I nearly completed a project that I started Friday night  just so I could complete a project . I just wanted the end result!!! This is SO not like me. I don't knit ANYTHING just so I can complete it. In fact, I prefer NOT to complete things. I just don't know what's come over me. I feel like a different person.

      Well, since there is no  urlLink Friday Five  this week, I'm just going to answer a Friday Five for the last time my birthday fell on a FF day.     November 30, 2001   1. What did you have for dinner last night?    French fries, an orange creme smoothie, and a cup of hazelnut coffee.   2. Do you ever get up for a midnight snack?   No. I try not to eat past 9 PM.   3. What's your favorite dessert?   My cheesecake.   4. Tell us something about you that would surprise us.   I'm slightly color blind, and I'm losing my hearing in a bad way. In fact, I'm becoming tone deaf because of that.   5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?   Quietly at home.     I started working on one of the big gifts for a gift package yesterday, and I was able to complete several inches of it during last night's  urlLink SnB . I am actually much more excited about working on this gift item over the other ones that I was doing because its a really easy knit and its a lot of fun too. Plus, I get to work on the needles that I made for myself. As far as the Town Grind goes, the entertainment there last night was  urlLink awesome , unfortunately, the Town Grind failed to put the performer's information up on their  urlLink calendar  so I can't link to who the guy is. Maybe  urlLink someone who knows  will comment. Also, notice how there is no one scheduled on Thursday's at the Town Grind? Yeah.   So anyway, in non-knitting news, I decided that I would go to the  urlLink Bridgewater Mall  this morning because Victoria's Secret opened up after their renovations again and they were giving out $150 worth of gifts with every $50 purchase starting at 9 AM. I got there a little after 10 AM, expecting a normal mall day. Let's just say that I left without getting anything at all and that it was a total waste of my time. There was a  two hour wait  to get into VS. The line wrapped clear arond the second floor of the mall, and there were cops standing guard. There were  urlLink frosty women  donning their  urlLink  frosted hair   urlLink running with baby carriages  and cutting in front of people in the line just so they could get into the store quicker than the next person. It was insanity, and I left without waiting on any line and without anything from VS. The $150 gift was not worth two hours of my time. I don't wear their cheap ass purfume anyway, ya know what I mean???   And back to knitting news,  urlLink Kate  and I can't decide what yarn to use for the Cobweb Frill that we want to start eventually.  urlLink Mercerized cotton ?  urlLink Acrylic ?  urlLink Silk ?  urlLink Wool ?  urlLink Alpaca ? Seriously, the choices are endless and I don't have the kind of time to evaluate each and every one right now. Stupid yarn!

      Knitting has really been occupying my "gee,  urlLink I don't know what to do with myself " time. Mike is home on a pseudo-vacation, so I can't work on anything for him. I don't really feel like working on my  urlLink cable cardie , because I'm doing shaping on it right now and I don't feel like  urlLink thinking . I really didn't feel like working on any of the gift stuff either. I feel like a  urlLink whiney teenager . Anyone who knows me at all knows that this means I started (another) new project. I've decided to frog the first  urlLink Cape Mod  that I did (no pictures -- sorry!) using  urlLink LB Wool-Ease T&Q in Fisherman , as well as the  urlLink shawl  I just finished using the  urlLink Turkish Stitch pattern  so I can make myself a big, fluffy caridgan out of it that is the  urlLink opposite of fashionable . Maybe I'll even embellish the thing with some tacky  urlLink flowers and crap . The point is that I'm not too concerned with the outcome of the sweater as long as it fits. (Yeah, I'm in THAT kind of mood.)  Last night, I did finish making a knitting tote bag for myself using pillowcases. It looks AWESOME. In fact, I want to make more of them for myself since they are so cheap to make, and I want to use them as my every day bags -- not just for knitting. I even made a  urlLink needle holder pocket  on the inside! I'll take pictures and post them soon, but the gals who go to this week's  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch  will get a look at it first since I'm already using it.  ... Okay. Hold up. I'm listening to  urlLink Freezepop  right now, and they cover the  urlLink Jem Theme Song  on their  urlLink Fancy Ultra Fresh CD . Can I just say that their cover is  urlLink SO AWESOME !?  Anyway, I'm outta here for today. Mike wants  urlLink Taco Smell  for dinner, and I can't deny him that since it is his  urlLink birthday .

      Well, I can't do any more in the kitchen until the  urlLink dishwasher  is finished with the last load I put in; I can't do any knitting until my  urlLink nails  are dry from the Maybelline Colorama Top Coat in Frosty Pink that I just slapped on. (For some reason, I can't find a Maybelline site in English to reference this nail polish to. Anyway, since I'm really into totally sheer nail polishes right now, this Colorama Top Coat stuff is pretty awesome since its nice and VERY sheer. The idea is that you buy a base coat, and then change up the colors with the top coat, but whatever. I'm wearing the top coat by itself.)  For some reason today, I got into this whole big kick that I would do all I could to "plan" a  urlLink wedding ; meaning, I was online making up the guest list, researching potential reception sites, and "finalizing" my idea of the  urlLink perfect wedding dress . Why am I doing this? I don't know. It just felt like the thing to do today. It also confirmed that perhaps the  urlLink whole big ass wedding thing  isn't quite for me as much as it would be for my  urlLink family . *sigh*  As far as knitting goes, I keep getting all these ideas, but I haven't acted on any of them. Nothing jumps out at me right now as something that I really want to make, so I'm really looking forward to  urlLink Thursday  and receiving  urlLink this  sometime within the next day or two so I can start working on the  urlLink Cobweb Frill . I actually checked out some yarn for this while I was out, but decided not ot buy anything yet since I have no idea what the pattern suggests.  This is all jibberish, isn't it. Hmpf. No more internet for me today.

      Also, because I failed to mention this previously, Blogger's user support is the best I've received from any company to date. This boggles my mind even further because I am not even a paying customer -- I use their free service. I don't plan on moving this blog to any other server. In fact, should I acquire the fundage, I'll be upgrading this to a paid account. The support is THAT GOOD.  Three cheers for Blogger. Seriously.

      This weekend went rather  urlLink crappy . I attended my grandmother's funeral where there was an underlying degree of  urlLink family drama , and I got pretty much nothing else done. Poor Mike believes that HBO's  urlLink Sopranos  is based on my family now. Poor guy.  This morning, I got some more required knitting done, however I haven't updated my little progess bars yet. How lazy is that? I also just  urlLink cut my hair  using a three mirror system and  urlLink my good scissors  and I love the way it looks now. I should do this  urlLink professionally , except only for myself since I don't think I trust myself to do other people's hair.   I'm about to leave the house to go get some supplies to make a nifty (not so) little tote bag for my knitting supplies because I'm feeling rather  urlLink down  and I think that "shopping" will help. I know it won't, but I'll use any excuse I can come up with.  Somehow, I did manage to finish the red shawl I was working on in time for yesterday's viewing and I haven't stopped wearing it yet. Too bad I used  urlLink rather crappy  yarn to make it.

      Gee, look! I'm online again!  urlLink *waves* .  I needed to take a break from my maniacal knitting because, so far, I've almost finished what I was working on last night, stopped, restarted on smaller needles, frogged that, and then started AGAIN. The  urlLink cats  (those aren't mine) are going  urlLink insane  because I've got them  urlLink "locked up"  in the basement so I can get some work done. Apparently, they don't like not being able to see me. They won't stop  urlLink singing  to me from behind the door.  I figured that during this break from the  urlLink insanity , I would take some time to do the  urlLink Friday Five . I used to do these in my  urlLink LiveJournal , except my LiveJournal is  urlLink 'friends only' , so no one could actually  urlLink SEE  anything. I'll start doing them here, I guess. :)   Friday Five   If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? Home cooked food. I would be the head chef, and all dishes would be based on my recipes. Those recipes include everything from vegetarian dishes, Italian dishes, Japanese dishes, Mongolian dishes, Southern dishes, and BBQ.  2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? I would sell common sense to common sense deficient individuals.   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? It would probably be a book similar to  urlLink Normal is Just a Setting on the Dryer .  4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? See Question #2.  5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? Think Nellie McKay meets the Lunachicks meets Coldplay.

      I just found out that I am not crazy. Blogger keeps changing my template back to the old one -- complete with old WIPs and old progress bars. If I have to change my template back to what it is supposed to be everyday, then I'm just going to move this blog somewhere else.

      Now, I changed the colors/backgrounds, etc. on this blog on Wednesday. However, every once in a while, when I view my blog, the OLD colors/backgrounds, etc. show up.  I'm not an  urlLink internet novice . I cleared everything in the computer from my history, to the cache, to the  urlLink cookies , to the files. Hell, I even hit  urlLink refresh  a few times. For some reason, the content remains updated and the graphics do not.   Is it just me? Perhaps, but I'm looking for some confirmation on that...  Do you see a purple scheme, or a green scheme? Can you sometimees see green, and other times see purple, still? Let me know.  ---  On to knitting news.  Last night, I discovered that I, too, can  urlLink knit Continental . Imagine that. As if I need to  urlLink knit faster . I'm applying this newfound skill on the st st fabrics that I need to finish for some of my projects. Hopefully, I will be less bored with knitting them now that I can practice a different knitting style on them.  I also had a moment of clarity this morning, specifically at 9:22 AM. I stopped, stared down at the US5's in my hand that held the stitches for the project I need to finish by this afternoon, and said, "Well, hot damn. I should be doing this differently!"  I didn't want to be too hasty in my decision, so instead of frogging the work, I actually just cut the yarn this time and left what I had completed so far on the needles in case I have another moment of clarity and decide to go back to what I was doing originally.   I've determined that I need to switch to US2's, and I need to have DOUBLE the number of sts to form the body of the piece. I also figured out that it would look less "stretched" if I followed the chart by skipping stitches in between each stitch. Doesn't make sense? Well, I'll elaborate after this weekend when I am able to without ruining the surprise. I'm also starting from the bottom instead of the top this time so I can get the colorwork out of the way and return to the monotonous K1P1 ribbing later in the day when I don't want to think anymore.  And, last night's  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch  was a hoot, and I really don't need to elaborate here.  urlLink Bar , anyone?

      A super huge ENORMOUS  urlLink Thank You  goes out to  urlLink Kate  for pointing out that no one could see that there are links in my blog entries. Apparently, my googling skills were going unnoticed, and we just can't have that.  All links are  urlLink underlined  now, so feel free to check them out! The links in the "About Nicole" entry have been fixed too.  And I'm totally looking forward to Stitch 'n Bitch tonight because I haven't gotten any knitting done in days!

      Well, I'm pretty excited tonight. I get to drive the  urlLink Trailblazer  to tonight's  urlLink SnB  instead of the trusty  urlLink Hyundai . Its a good thing I  urlLink quit   urlLink smoking  last week, otherwise I probably wouldn't be so happy about this. But, we're expecting  urlLink MORE snow , so what can ya do?  So far, for the past couple of days, I haven't done any knitting at all. I've done blog renovations, worked on the front page to a website,  urlLink uploaded pictures , sent emails, researched how to  urlLink make a rosary , etc. But, I haven't done any knitting.  I am in the process of uploading more pictures to the WIPs/FOs folder. And if you really want to, you can check those out by clicking on that cute little link over in the sidebar. :)

      I just spent the better part of the day  urlLink renovating  this blog a little bit.   Under  My Personal Links , if you click on "About Nicole", you will be directed to a  urlLink short autobiography   that includes pictures and perhaps a few facts that you weren't aware of about  urlLink yours truly .  The background image now is of the  urlLink cabled sweater  that I am currently working on, and I changed everything up to match it. It is, in fact, just a coincidence that my blog is now  urlLink green  and today is  urlLink St. Patty's Day .   If you click on "WIPs and FOs" in the sidebar, the link will take you to my  urlLink  Yahoo Photos page  , where you can see some pictures of everything that I am working on currently, and things that I have completed more recently (i.e. since January '04). If you would rather just view one project at a time, feel free to click on each individual link underneath the  WIPs and FOs  header. A couple of the items listed do not yet have pictures to accompany them. This will change soon.  Hope everyone likes the changes! I know I do.  --- As far as knitting goes, I worked on the  urlLink cable sweater  last night for a couple of hours and I now have 4 1/4 inches of the back completed.   I also discovered that while it only took me less than a week to accomplish some of the  urlLink colorwork pieces  that I had been working on, it is now taking me over three weeks to complete the  urlLink plain st st  sides of the pieces. I think I have just discovered that st st work no longer holds my attention, as these projects would surely be completed by now had I done colorwork in place of the plain pieces.   I have also abandoned all hope of finishing the  urlLink "Along Came Polly" interpretation shawl  before  urlLink tomorrow  because I have so much to do around the house, and everywhere else that I just don't see myself sitting down to finish it. I would much rather work on the cable sweater than the shawl at this point. (How did I know that was going to happen??? See March 10th's entry:  I really need to finish the Liv Tyler/Kyoto-esque sweater that I started though. The yarn shipment from Elann is going to get here soon and I know I won't want to be bothered with the sweater once there is new yarn for me to play with. )   And, I really need to get crackin' on that one gift knit that I'm working on. Its "due" soon. Very soon, and I don't want to be cramped for time on Friday to finish it before  urlLink Mike  gets home.   Tomorrow's  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch  appears to be somewhat small... Just Anne and myself, so far. I think I will end up bringing the gift knit that is due this weekend with me to SnB to try to finish it up there, and I'll bring along the  urlLink shawl  too, in case I get bored of knitting the plain stitches.

      Ever feel like a  urlLink kid playing in the street with your friends  and then a  urlLink car  comes and interrupts your game? And then you call a "do over"? Well, that's what I'm doing.  Expect changes (some drastic perhaps, some subtle) to take place on this blog. I can't stand that it  urlLink looks so 1999 . I also can't stand that the extent of my learning HTML, XTML, and Java ended in 1999 either. Oh well.   The cord and thingy to plug the actual digital camera into the computer have been relocated (joy!), so I will be able to upload pictures of much better quality than the ones I threw up on here originally. I'm also working on linking each individual WIP to its own folder containing images and information in my Yahoo Photos. Its after 12:30 in the morning, and I'm still uploading pics. I haven't linked any yet, but the transition will take place. Don't you  urlLink worry.   I'm also going to be replacing the background image, as well as the colors of the blog in the next week. I'm trying to make it as functional as possible, but with my limited page making skills and the fact that this is on blogger, I'm not having too much  urlLink luck  as of yet.  I  urlLink apologize  to anyone who reads this for not overhauling this blog sooner, because if blogs could go on TV shows, this one would totally be on  urlLink What Not To Wear.

      When I was a little girl, I believed that  urlLink Robert Plant  was singing, "You need  urlLink Kool-Aid ." Imagine my surprise when I was a little older and discovered that the lyrics are actually, "You need coolin'." Interestingly enough, when I was a little kid (we're talkin' about 3 years old here), my favorite movie was  urlLink The Elephant Man  and I didn't understand the look or horror on my parents' faces when I asked them for an  urlLink Elephant  urlLink  Man   urlLink doll . What can I say -- I was  urlLink unusual !  Last night, I was supposed to register a name for my site (yay!), but that didn't happen. I'm really not too pleased with Blogger and the layout of my blog, and that will all be changed once I jump  ship  to something more  urlLink "fun" . Links to seperate pages showing my  WIPs , Links to FOs... Basically just better  urlLink navigation  as well as better  urlLink bells  and  urlLink whistles .  I also started working on the cable cardigan again since  urlLink Elann  delivered  urlLink my yarn  in Fresh Pesto. I cast on 138 sts last night and I've got an inch and a half worked up already. Go me. I  urlLink figure   that I should be able to finish this thing at least by September if I  urlLink calculate  my time correctly. I also did about  urlLink half an inch  of one of the gift projects, and two rows of the Along Came Polly Shawl. Today, I really need to  urlLink get my ass into gear  and work on something that needs to be finished by the end of the week.   P.S. I can't stop touching the inch and a half of sweater!

      Poor  urlLink Kate . I just spewed a  whole big rant  about knitting, patterns, and  urlLink copyright  in an email to her. I should have just put my thoughts here so that they could either be ignored or read by interested parties... But no. Sorry Kate!!!  Anyway, here is my rant about knitting, patterns and copyright. Feel free to comment with your thoughts on this.   In my opinion, nothing that anyone knits now could ever be considered novel and ingenious. It surely has all been done before, right? Knitting has been around for centuries and it would be ignorant to say that something you have knit yesterday is of a brand new design and has never been done.   But that's not how it is. There are magazines devoted to "new" patterns, books devoted to "new" patterns, and there are even online 'zines devoted to "new" patterns. People come up with their own patterns all the time. However, every once in a while, if the pattern is made public,  the "new pattern" is a subject of dispute because someone else scoured the earth and found a pattern that is nearly identical to the "new one". I like to consider myself an internet sleuth. Ask anyone I know personally -- I can find out ANYTHING. But even I failed at locating some "originals" when I search.  I believe that since no pattern we come up with now could possibly be new, if a knitter works up a pattern using what I would consider "common knowledge" (for shaping, sizes, etc), then they should be able to say that the pattern is their own without having to scour the inner earth core and the internet archives looking for something similar. I mean, if the knitter does a search and nothing comes up that is an exact pattern for what the knitter has done, then can't the knitter assume that he/she has created a new pattern? I just can't see why you would be required to do hours of extensive research in books and online patterns just to figure out whether or not your idea is "original". Its ridiculous! Mainly because, like I've said before, after hundreds of years of knitting, no idea is original anymore!  Its like a never ending battle circle where those with A LOT of time on their hands can yell "copyright infringement" at just about anything.   There are no new patterns, only improvements. And according to copyright law, improvements are not to be made lawfully by anyone except the pattern author otherwise it infringes on the author's copyright. So where does that leave us, in the 21st century? Can there possibly be a new pattern that no one has ever thought of before? Maybe.  Isn't it possible that this pattern was around forever in someone's family and it was never copyrighted? Probably. Is it just that knitters and other yarn crafters are so vain that they like to stake claims on ideas? I don't know the answer to this. But this is my view.

      I got off to a bad start on Friday. I happily decided that I would start one of the gift projects that I need to finish soon and discovered that I  urlLink lost  (gasp) the chart I made for the project. I  urlLink pouted and stomped  around the house looking through pretty much everything trying to locate the missing graph paper, but I caved in and made a new one instead. I actually like the new one better than the first one. Maybe the first was one was just too ashamed to be found because it knew it sucked. Or, maybe I subconsciously knew it sucked and threw it out. Or, maybe its just folded and tucked into a page of one of my knitting books and I didn't see it. We will never know. I'm really excited about finishing it though because it just means that I will be able to post pictures of it. Yay! (Or, Boo!, if you don't like my pictures.) :)  In other news, I  urlLink learned to crochet  at last week's  urlLink SnB . I will admit right here that I couldn't crochet to save my life until Sunday. Now, I'm happily crocheting along (I'm already on row three!) and making one of those JS Shawls in purple. Seriously, though. I don't care if its a  urlLink trendy , hip thing. You know what I have to say to that? GOOD! That means I won't be the only freak of nature walking around with wraps and shawls on. Can we get an "amen"? Amen.  I also started another one of those  urlLink Turkish Stitch Shawls , but this time it is in Red (Red Heart TLC in Claret), on Size US 11's, and uses a single strand of yarn. This is probably one of the quickest knitting patterns EVER. I started this on Friday, put it down until Sunday, and I should be done with it by Wednesday since I'm going to be working on gift items for the majority of my time.    "Majority of my time". I feel as though I need to clarify that statement. It should read, "majority of my KNITTING time". Yes, it is true I don't work (I like to refer to myself as a S.M.I.T. -- soccer mom in training), but that doesn't mean that I don't have responsibilities and it certainly does not mean that I sit at home and knit all day long. I *wish* that's what I did, but it isn't. And in all honesty, if that is what I did, then I would lead a very sad, boring life. Generally, I get no more than an hour of knitting done during the day, unless someone has requested that I make something for them by the end of the day (I'm looking at you Anne, re:  urlLink The Hat ).  In the grand scheme of things, I do far more housework, cooking, baking and organizing than I do anything crafty. So during the day, I get about just as much time to knit as someone who knits during the day only on their lunch break. At night during the week, I generally pick up my knitting again after dinner while we watch TV, or while Mike plays a video game. If its a REALLY GOOD show (i.e. The Sopranos, or  urlLink Curb Your Enthusiasm ), then I don't even THINK about knitting. And if I'm playing the video game with Mike, then its pretty much impossible to knit. If I knit without interruption on week nights, I generally can knit for about two and a half to three hours. And, on the weekends, I knit for a couple of hours here and there unless we are out somewhere.  So, to sum it up, being a S.M.I.T. doesn't automatically give me the go ahead to do nothing but crafty things all day long, so don't go assuming things. :)   I haven't touched the  urlLink Liv/Kyoto sweater  since the last time I blogged about touching it. Ideally, I would like this thing to be done by May, but I can't guarantee that.  I should have finished one of the package gifts either the last time I blogged about working on it, but I didn't. I lost most of my inspiration, and I am very slowly regaining it back. I haven't heard from one of the recipients in, like, two weeks, and while I was completely touched (and therefore inspired) by what she had last written to me, I feel less inclined to bust my ass to complete the package now because of that. Also, while we are on the topic of people who EXPECT to recieve gifts from me because I knit, I feel like I should bring this up. That's a  major no-no . In fact, when I find out that someone EXPECTS me to knit something for them, it makes me  less likely to do so  because it makes me realize that the requester has  no concept or appreciation  of the craft. Their name gets put on the end of my "gift list". Does anyone else do this, or is it just me? I just like knowing that the hand knit items that I make go to people who actually appreciate them. I can't stand people and their "I want, I want" attitudes. As if I'd really rather knit something for you, Mr./Ms. Unappreciative, than for myself. Pffft.  On Saturday, Mike and I went to Evan's (my nephew) birthday at my step sister's house. I got to check out his newly decorated room, as well as the new baby's room and of course I was inspired. I plan on presenting something to Evan (he's two!) at Christmas that will go with the room decor perfectly. I'd really like to start working on it by June, though, because I don't want to get myself into a bind like I did last year.   And speaking of last year... I've decided that I am only going to do ONE larger scaled knitting piece as a gift per Christmas. As much as I would love to give everyone in my family huge knitted gifts, its just not going to happen. Last year, I wore myself out by starting late in the game (October) and struggling to complete afghans and other large items for people. Not this year. This year, Evan is getting the big gift, and everyone else gets little ones. Next year, someone else will get the big gift, and everyone else will get little ones. Its fair that way, don't you think?  In completely non-knitting news, I discovered that  urlLink Dawn Liquid Dish Soap  is more awesome than I originally thought it was. Over the summer, I impressed a friend when I revealed that my hair was shiny and soft because I washed it with Dawn. I always impressed myself everytime I used Dawn to get out oil/grease stains, and unidentified spots on our carpet. On New Years Eve, I impressed other people when I got a crapload of red wine out of someone's light blue button down shirt. So yeah, you would think that I would be completely unphased when the power of Dawn gently removed dried kelly green acrylic paint from my pink sapphire/diamond ring. That paint was REALLY up in there too. But yeah, its gone now. Soaked the ring in some warm water with a few drops of Dawn for a couple of hours.  Don't underestimate the power of Dawn, people.

      Anyone who reads this knows that this has been long overdue, and frankly, I was getting tired of looking at my picture-less blog. These pictures aren't really the greatest -- I took them using one of those Logitech eyeball-like web cams. But they are still pictures none the less! And I'm really sorry that I am a co-star in these pictures, but it was the best I could do.   The Cat's Paw Lace Shawl  Source: www.freepatterns.com/fp_pdfs/pre-database/ knitting/Cats_Paw_Lace_Shawl.pdf  Materials: Size US 8(?) needles, mill ends of acrylic nubby multi-color flecked sage yarn Notes: The pattern, as written is inaccurate. If you are going to follow it, be sure to use your head and don't rely too much on the written instructions about 3/4 of the way through.           My (Bad) Replica of the JS Shawl using a Turkish Stitch Pattern  Source: knitting.about.com/library/blshawl4.htm Materials: Size US 17 Circulars; 2 Skeins Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick in Fishermann Notes: This was by far the fastest knit pattern I have ever followed.         The Valentine's Day Wrap  Source: www.knitlist.com/97gift/quickthrow.htm Materials Used: Vintage White, Antique Rose, Baby Pink and Off White Acrylic Yarns on Size US 10 Needles, as well as two dozen glass rose and antique white colored beads that didn't show up very well in any pictures. Notes: I *love* this particular pattern and I try to use it for everything. As it is written, the pattern knits up to about 30 inches wide, and you stop knitting whenever you feel as though you have enough length. This wrap measures 32" by 92".         Enjoy!

      Okay, I just typed up this SUPER LONG DESCRIPTIVE post, and the internet ATE IT!  *sigh*  I'll try to recap as best I can.  You know those priorities that flew out the window last week? Well, they are half way to Japan right now.  Let me put it this way. I got REALLY BORED of knitting the same stuff. I like variety and this new knitting method was totally cramping my knitting style. On Monday night, I decided that I would do the unthinkable, and start something for myself. Notice how I didn't say "work on something for myself that I have already started". That's important, because that is the kind of knitter (baker, cooker, painter, organizer, etc.) that I am. Like many people, I also got totally sucked into watching Jessica Simpson be dumb for 30 minutes each week on Newly Weds. My jaw could usually be found 2 inches from the ground in awe at both her lack of common sense as well as her amazing wardrobe and accessories. I absolutely fell in love with her shawls, and her buttery leather bag (SHE HAS TWO!!!!!). Don't think that I didn't try to work up a plan to make a replica bag, but I am no leather worker, and frankly, that hobby seems much more expensive than knitting. So, I decided to do my best to replicate (and I'm using that term very loosely) Jessica's shawl. I am not a very flowery kind of person, and I don't crochet, so I was left with airy, openwork stitches and my imagination. My imagination started running away from me, so I turned to the internet and found this pattern (http://knitting.about.com/library/blshawl4.htm).   Two skeins of Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick in Fishermann, that pattern, and a couple of hours on a set of size 17 circulars was all it took to create a really cute (and stretchy) shawl. I LOVE IT. Well, I might love it more if I use one more skein to make it a little bit larger. I like my wraps and shawls super-sized (My Valentine's Day Wrap measured 32"x92", and its my favorite). Plus, I have about 6 skeins left of the yarn so it wouldn't hurt to use a little more up, right? I'm going to bring (i.e. wear) the shawl to tomorrow's SnB so I can see what the gals think about adding more to it.   Also, notice how I  started  (and finished) a NEW project for myself? Let's not forget about the fact that I have a couple on needles (and on stitch holders) already waiting to be finished. This is very important because it is a perfect example of how I work. And not just for knitting either. I'm like this with baking, cooking, painting, writing songs, organizing, etc. It's a personality trait/flaw that I have learned to embrace, even if it does make my life more difficult at times. :)  I really need to finish the Liv Tyler/Kyoto-esque sweater that I started though. The yarn shipment from Elann is going to get here soon and I know I won't want to be bothered with the sweater once there is new yarn for me to play with.   Scratch that.  I  really  need to finish the gift items that I started  before  I finish my Liv/Kyoto-esque sweater, and  before  I even open the Elann package.   Yes, I really do owe my conscious for that one.  Before I end this entry and go back to knitting, or whatever else I need to do before Mike gets home, please share in this obsession with me. I have been sucked into WEBoggle for the past few days, and I just can't seem to get enough of it. Its really fun, in a boring sort of way. It reminds me A LOT of Bookworm, which I absolutely love, except you play against other people and the letters don't shift. Go here (http://plutor.org/boggle/) and play. If I'm playing, I'll be on there as "nik".   Happy Knitting! (And WEBoggle-ing!)

      I am so excited. Apparently, I am getting enough Elann Sonata in "Fresh Pesto" to complete the cabled cardigan that I have been having such yarn anxiety over lately. I seriously cannot even begin to describe how excited I am about this. I really hope that using good (better?) yarn doesn't sway me from ever wanting to use acrylic again. I would much rather spend a glamorous budget on things for the house and finishing the basement, not yarn.

      You know what my problem is? I knit too damn quickly, and I *hate* completing projects. I'd much rather everything I have on needles STAY on needles. Somehow, that's so much more satisfying for me. So, I determined that I can knit up the the stuff for the packages in less than two weeks. That gives me a lot of time to play with other things on needles. So I am. [insert evil laughter here]  The other night, Liv Tyler was on Jay Leno, and her top was GORGEOUS. It sort of reminded me of Knitty's Kyoto, but nicer -- flouny-er and more shapely. So, of course, I decided that I needed to make a top that was inspired by Liv's for myself. I'm using Knitty's Kyoto as a guide and Liv's top as my main source of inspiration. Isn't this wonderful? I'm even going to be cutting into my yarn stash to make it! And I never thought I'd find use for 2000 yards of Antique White 3-ply Acrylic Baby Yarn.  I've already cast on and started working on the first half of the criss cross in the front -- three inches so far!!! I'm so excited. A sweater I can wear during the spring and summer. Yay.  Last night's SnB was so much fun. There was a poetry reading going on (apparently, there is a reading the first Thursday of each month) so we moved to another section of the cafe because the front half was like a library. The poetry reading would have been cool if there were more than three poets participating in it. And if one of the poems wasn't called "The Sound of Paper". And if the participating poets didn't look at US like we were the crazy bunch. Yeah. We're knitting. Must you comment on it and say that it is "cute". It was still fun though. Anne learned how to use circulars, and frankly, I hope she continues using them because they will put much less stress on her wrists and arms since the weight of her knitted pieces will be on the connector and not her wrists from supporting the straight needle. And Katie mentioned something about "stitches east", so I need to check that out. (Note to self: check out stitches east.)  One thing I was impressed with last night was the fact that I actually got some knitting done. More than two inches of something from Project 2P, to be somewhat exact. Last week, I got about three rows done of a 78 stitch wide wrap, and a few rows of a baby bootie that I ended up frogging while I was there. The week before, I got almost nothing done on the sweater that I was working on. I think I like "bitching" more than I like "stitching" when I'm around other people.  I've got to get back to doing some more work on my kimono style top and I'll scan in some shots of it later. :)

      I'm a little disappointed at myself. I literally have about 5 inches left of the difficult side of something for Package 1M before I have mindless knitting left on it, and I didn't finish it. I was planning on working on it during tonight's meet-up. Now, I'm all "AHHHHHHHHH" because I don't want to bring anything with me that requires concentration, I don't want to work on anything for myself (priorties, remember), and I really don't want to start anything new. *sigh*  I'll probably end up working on the mindless part of something for package 2P, actually. Don't ask me why I didn't think of that. I don't think my brain is enjoying working out complex situations today. And when I say complex situations, I really mean working my pattern backwards. You would think I'm dealing with brain surgery the way I worried about this, lol. See? This is what happens when you don't get a lot of sleep.  I figured out (another brain surgery level of thinking here, people) that I can slap my work on the scanner and upload it to the web. Of course, you won't get the full picture of items, but you'll get the jist. I have to do that this weekend.  I have been hemming and hawing over what yarn to choose for my cable sweater. I'd LOVE to work with some Debbie Bliss Tweed or Cashmerino, but are those really worth the price? Aren't there comparible yarns that are less expensive? Maybe there aren't, but I wouldn't really know. I haven't heard too much about either except that some people are not happy with the way the Cashmerino holds up after some wear, and since I plan on wearing the sweater all the time I don't know if its worth it to buy that yarn for it. Decisions, decisions.  Anyway, I'm outta hee-ere. I've got to get ready to leave in half an hour.

      Last night, Mike came home with a package for me. He handed me a first edition (1982) hardcover book in PERFECT condition,  urlLink The Bedspread by Sylvia Fair . Some time ago, I expressed to him that between the ages of three and five, this was my favorite book. I remember clearly returning home with that book from the library on many occassions. Apparently, that book is no longer being printed, and the copies that are in existance are mostly from libraries, have weakened bindings, have writing on the pages -- if the pages are intact at all. Mike had gone on a quest for nearly a year trying to locate a better-than-decent copy of this book for me and had to deal with horrible ebay and paypal to get it. I read the book to him last night, and he laughed and said that it was typical that  The Bedspread  was a favorite of mine when I was a child. The book is about two sisters who sew, knit, embroider and embellish a plain white bedspread to reflect their memories of the home they lived in as children until they die. Then, the bedspread is put into a museum for everyone to view. Its such an amazing book and I really wish it wasn't out of print!

      I just played this game for about 5 minutes and its awesome, so I thought I'd share the info for those of you who area also into playing games. On the off chance that others of you do play that game, let me know here! I'm The Green Rex on that game.   And, for those of you who aren't afraid to play  urlLink WeBoggle  with me (like Anne and Mike are), I play that as nik.

      That is my new high score on Bookworm. I'm so proud.  Anyway, I've got this  urlLink green yarn  that I'm planning to make into a wrap or shawl. You know, because I don't have enough wraps and shawls already. I'm a little hesitant to settle on a pattern just yet. Originally, I was thinking a fairly simple triangular shawl, but I really don't wear triangular shawls as shawls -- I wear them as elaborate scaves. I could always use my fall back (most favorite pattern ever) -- a variation of the feather and fan stitch pattern, but I have so many of those I don't know if I really NEED another one. Even if it is my favorite. I did up little swatches (gasp!) using a bobble stitch, a trinity stitch, a lily of the valley panel and some lacuna shells, but I decided that I didn't really like those either. Frankly, I shouldn't even be working on this for myself until I have at least completed the  urlLink blanket  for Dana.   As far as  urlLink tonight's knitting  goes, I'm really looking forward to the Mongolian Peanut Chicken Salad and a tall glass of coconut italian soda. And, maybe -- just maybe, I might get some knitting done. :)

      I was browsing through the  urlLink Knitter's Review Messageboard , and I began reading the  urlLink Knitting Celebs, Movies, Jokes, etc.  forum. I found a post in regard to the movie  urlLink Lost in Translation , and more specifically, in regard to whether or not Scarlett Johansson's character in the movie is a serious knitter or not.   You know, as if it truly matters.   Anyway, I started reading the replies, and I came across  this :     "...She obviously wasn't a committed knitter.  If she had been, she would have been knitting on the train, in the lobby, shopping for yarn, etc..."     I guess the only way that you can be considered a committed knitter is if you let knitting and every aspect of it consume your entire life. I guess "committed knitters" are simply people who are not well rounded in any way, shape or form; nor do they show interest in anything that does not involve knitting. Moreover, committed knitters must use every single opportunity of "down time" to knit something -- anything, otherwise they clearly are  not  committed. How dare a knitter simply sit in peace and just  be  when they could be knitting something? Committed knitters must live, breath, and think about knitting, stitches, yarn and techniques AT ALL TIMES otherwise they are simply casual knitters who do not take the craft seriously. And, when I say craft, I mean "way of life," because knitting is a way of life for committed knitters and anyone who considers it a craft or a hobby is just a casual  here and there  knitter.   Come on now. You're kidding me, right? Why do people have to get so out of hand about things like this?    It should go like this:  Knitting? Oh, cool.  Not like this:  OH MY GOD! KNITTING! AWESOME! I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE MYSELF UNLESS I HAVE TWO NEEDLES IN MY HANDS AT ALL TIMES!!! TO HELL WITH EVERYTHING ELSE IN MY LIFE -- I MUST KNIT!!!  ...  On a side note, I'm going to go see  urlLink A Perfect Circle  on Saturday, and I'm pretty excited about that. I also started a purple poncho (I'm SOOO gonna look like  urlLink Barney  in this thing, but I don't care), and I'm looking forward to perhaps finishing it in time for the concert.

      Its  urlLink SnB  night, and of course, I don't know what to bring with me. I had been bringing along the  urlLink baby blanket  for a while now, but that's done... I *should* bring the other baby blanket I'm working on, but I don't wanna work on that right now... I *could* bring the prayer shawl I'm making, but wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of the prayer shawl? Like, aren't you supposed to pray with every stitch... or something like that? I'm not too sure gabbing about  urlLink peanut butter silk pie  counts as praying. I *could* work on the Felineal Angel blanket, but I haven't even graphed out what I'm going to do yet, so that would just be assinine. There's that baby sweater that I haven't started yet. There's also  urlLink MY sweater  (gee, I really SHOULD update those pictures), but I'd prefer not to work on that amongst a  urlLink group of people . There's that mindless poncho that has been sitting on needles for a few months now. Hmmmm... Decisions, decisions. I *could* just bring my cone of cotton and make little  urlLink washcloths  for myself. Or, I *could* start the  urlLink shawl  for my stepsister, Steph, but she didn't decide on a color and I could never finish it in time to give it to her  urlLink tomorrow  anyway. Maybe I'll just bring everything I can fit into my super-sized bag and go from there.  Oh, and if I show up wearing  urlLink flip flops , someone needs to  urlLink smack me . I've got no business wearing these things because I'm a  urlLink dangerous enough walker  as it is wearing sneakers. Wearing flip flops, I'm bound to injure  urlLink large groups  of people -- not just myself.   So anyway, on a non-knitting note, I've decided that I will boycott  urlLink the entire   urlLink month   urlLink of April  for now on. Seriously. At this point, I'm just glad that they say  urlLink bad things come in threes . I've already got my three... Time to move on.

      I've become totally addicted to  urlLink PopCap's Bookworm  for the  urlLink GBA  since I got it for Easter. I even put down my needles last night to play this instead. I am such a  urlLink word game junkie . I should go sign up over at word game junkie anonymous. I've actually only played three Bookworm games total on the GBA since Easter, which in my opinion is really great, and I'm currently trying to beat my high score of 195k+... I can't remember the exact number. My biggest fear is that I will lose my game in the middle of a "play" because I haven't charged my GBA in FOREVER. I think Mike got me Bookworm on purpose so he wouldn't be forced to hear, "click.. click. click, click." while he's watching tv or something. He won't even play against me anymore in  urlLink WeBoggle . Anne claims that she won't either because it angers her to play against me, but I don't believe her. I think I'll be able to rope her back in for at least another five games before she totally quits on me. What was really funny was at the shower on Sunday, they decided to play this word game where you choose two names, and then are given a few minutes to come up with as many words as possible from the letters in those names. Of course,  urlLink I won . By something like twelve names. I even got a prize -- some Cotton Blossom lotion from Bath and Body works! When I told Mike about the game and how I won, he just groaned and said that he should have warned them and they shouldn't have let me play that game because no one else would have been able to stand a chance. He then reminded me of the  urlLink King of the Hill episode  where Peggy is in the Boggle Championship. Right now, I am going to admit something I should probably not admit. I went home and looked up "boggle championships" online, and came up with no results outside of that one episode. Thanks, King of the Hill, for getting my geeky hopes up!  So, anyway, I'm a big geek who loves word games and won't let other people win at them. I'll have to design myself an item that incorporates word games into the stitches or something. :)

      Okay, I'm still using the dreaded laptop, so again, there will be NO LINKS to pictures in this entry. I really need to start using the PC to update this blog because these entries are really just way to boring now.  The Gift Package is not only completed, but has already been given as a gift! So, since the recipient already received it, I can talk about it here, FINALLY. The blanket came out beautifully, and I received so many compliments on it from the shower guests. Everyone wanted to know how long I worked on it. Forty plus hours. Not including the time I took when I frogged the entire (completed) backside of the piece and reknit it, done over the course of three days (Wednesday thru Saturday), and re-completed just in time for the shower on Sunday. The blanket is cushy, beautiful, warm, thick, and the perfect weight for baby Lauren to use in the autumn/winter months, as well as for her to use as a cushy "mat" for her to lay on the floor with when she is playing. I am really excited about it and although I took about 20 pictures of the finished product, I don't have any online yet.   I also had two of my tattoos put up on the KniTattoos site (see sidebar for link), so I'm pretty excited about that. I realize that I was VERY late in submitting pictures to that, but better late than never, I say. I also put up a few more pictures of some of my tattoos on my Yahoo Photos Page (see sidebar for link) because I figured that Yahoo Photos was a good place to store pictures that I didn't want to lose. Imagine that!  Over the weekend, Mike and I did tons of good deeds. First, on Friday, we donated three stuffed garbage bags full of clothes (and shoes) to goodwill. We have tons more to donate, but those things weren't in garbage bags yet, so by the time we are done donating our clothes, we will have given them roughly 20 bags of clothing. Cool, right? Then, on Saturday, as we were leaving Wal-mart to return this horrible baby gate that we bought, I noticed that there was a huge package of diapers left laying the parking lot, so I put those aside so the person who dropped the bags could find them. Diapers are expensive, and that would have been a crappy waste of money! (No pun intended). People had been looking at the bags and walking past, and stepping over, and DRIVING AROUND the bags but weren't doing anything about it. Idiots. Saturday night, as we were on the last leg of running our errands and were pulling out of the gas station around 8:15 PM, we noticed that there was this little old lady with a desperate look on her face, standing next to an old (1979 Honda Accord) car with the hood up. She was blocking the entrance to the gas station/Quik Check combo and people were passing her by without giving her a second glance. Mind you, this was at a major intersection. Mike and I pulled off to the side and assisted her with her car. Eventually, two other older men tried helping too, but ended up leaving shortly after. We stayed with Bea while she called AAA on Mike's cell phone and we waited with her for about 35-45 minutes after she called. She was so grateful that we, two youngsters, took the time out of our lives to help her out that she insisted on buying us coffee.  Bea introduced my newfound obsession with Smores Coffee from Quik Check, where all cup sizes are 99 cents -- so it pays to get a gallon of coffee at a time!  We made sure that the people who were working knew that Bea was expecting AAA to arrive and we made sure she was OK before we left. I took down her name and number so I could call and check on her today to make sure everything turned out alright.  Mike and I drove home, dropped stuff off, and then drove back to check to see if Bea was still waiting there. It took all of fifteen to twenty minutes for us to do that, and when we went back, both Bea and her trusty '79 Accord were no longer there. AAA must have been hot on our heels as we were pulling out of the parking lot. I plan on making Bea a scarf to match her seafoam green outfit that she was wearing just to show her that people do care. Then, Sunday happened, and although the baby shower does not qualify as a good deed, I did get to feel the baby kicking, so that made my day.  Well, happy knitting to everyone and I'll be adding a project or two to the WIPs list shortly.

      I just wanted to thank everyone who left me messages in comments and in email. I really appreciate the kind words, and it makes me hopeful that people who were previously unaware of the disease may now at least know that it exists. I have set up a page for information on Corny and FIP at http://thebuddy.blogspot.com, with links to different sites on the internet that have information on the disease. I've really been rather "down" lately, and I feel as though everything I do is starting to reflect that, so I'm doing my best to get through this while trying to smile. I believe that all things happen for a reason, not to sound cliche. I am grateful that I got to have someone so special in my life, even if it was only for a few short years. I learned many things, about myself, about life. Sounds silly, doesn't it? That's okay. I don't mind.    This entry will have little or no links to pictures because I am working on the dreaded laptop again. Sorry to disappoint.   I nearly completed one of the gift packages yesterday, however I was displeased with the finished product. As I am not a stranger to the frog pond, I ended up joyfully frogging the half that I deemed "not worthy" and started that half over again late yesterday afternoon around 4 PM. Twelve inches down, fourteen inches to go. Not bad since its not even 24 hours later, right? The original half that I frogged to start over wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good enough to be immortalized in the same piece that had such "greatness". Well, in my opinion anyway. I proved my case to Mike and even convinced him that it really is about time that I get a good blocking board. I feel as though if I had the board to use in the first place, I wouldn't have needed to visit the frog pond on half of this piece. I really don't know if that is true or not, but for now, I'm happy to believe that I stink at measuring instead of believing that I stink at counting. Is there really a difference? Um, probably not, but ignorance is bliss these days. Anyway, I'm really pleased with the way the re-knit portion is coming out so I'm happy I chose to frog the piece I was less happy with.  This morning, driving home, I took a detour to the new Wal-mart on 22. I had twenty dollars in my pocket, and I felt as though I needed to get some alone-time-retail-therapy under my belt. I walked out with ten dollars worth of yarn. To my defense, only two of those skeins were for me -- the color was on clearance, and since I had two already at home, I felt that it was best to try to purchase as many in that color as possible, so I took the last two they had. All the other skeins, which were mostly discounted, are for gifts for other people, so I think my purchase is justified. I felt so great about spending that measley bit of money on supplies for other people that I even treated myself to a #2 at McDonalds! In the words of my father, I'm "going to turn into a McDonalds," but I'm okay with that. For now anyway. I'm pretty sure I'll regret eating junk next week. *sigh*   Today was the first day that I decided to start religiously slathering SPF45 on myself before I leave the house. One of my biggest fears is having a leather face like those women who opt to coat themselves in grease and bake themselves in the sun -- like chickens roasting in olive oil, so I figured that today was a good day to start a new regimen. I'm not saying that I've never done the greasy chicken roast thing myself, however I'm quite sure I value healthy skin more than I value what some consider a healthy glow. I can get that bronze glow from a bottle these days anyway.  Over the weekend (Sunday? Monday? I dunno...) I got to pick up quite a few skeins of yarn in order to make a very special blanket for the house, but I don't plan on starting that for at least another month, so I'm not going to even include that in my little WIP list yet. I'm really excited about it though. I want it to be my prized piece, and even if it comes out really crappy, it will end up being my prized piece anyway.  Speaking of WIPs, I will be updating the progress charts momentarily after I publish this post. Exciting, isn't it?  And, speaking of "WTF????'s", I just caught an episode of Extreme Makeover last night and I can honestly say that I was HORRIFIED. At everything about the show really. The scary looking people (and teeth!!!) that were getting made over, the fact that people were totally unrecognizable after their extreme plastic surgeries, and the fact that these two people "FOUND LOVE" during their makeover. I'm sorry, but yeah. The more I saw, the more horrified I was and I couldn't figure out what emotion I should have been feeling other than horror. Sure, I'll admit, sometimes I laughed, but that makes me cruel, and I'm really not that much of a cruel person. The previews for the next episode horrified me even more and I literally turned to Mike and said, "I can no longer whine about the fact that I have a grey streak in my hair anymore," and he just nodded and agreed.   I also caught an episode of the Bachelor with Jesse Palmer. Hello? Jesse Palmer? Why are you on the Bachelor? Shouldn't you be PRACTICING? I mean, seriously, its not like the Giants are any good at this point, but at least give your team's loyal fans the  illusion  that you are trying to change that, okay? I  can honestly say that I've never watched any episode of this program before and thought it was pretty funny. In fact, I got really excited when I found out that there was a spy, and began exclaiming things like "ooooh! that would be the perfect job for me!" etc, etc. But that novelty wore off when less than half way through the episode, they showed everyone who the spy was. Lame. It was cooler when we all sat there guessing, right? I think so. I also decided that if Mr. Quarterback trusts his friend there enough that he would want her assistance in choosing a mate, then he should have just ended up with her, said "screw you" to the producers of the show, and should go back to PRACTICING. He's no Joe Montana, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, usually, on Thursday afternoons, I post about how I'll be attending a SnB tonight, however I'm not going to be at the one this week. Its just been a really rough week for me, I'm really exhausted, I don't feel like putting on a happy face for all the gals, and I *really* don't feel up to driving there and back tonight.  I'm going to miss not seeing everyone tonight, but I'll be there as usual next week, etc. Hopefully, someone will eat some of that peanut butter silk pie in my honor or something. :)

      This weekend was an extremely difficult one for me. It seemed like it was going to be just like any other one, but it quickly took a turn for the worst. On Friday evening, Mike and I fed Corny as we usually did, however we noticed that he had not eaten his food from the night before and his breathing appeared to be labored. We watched him carefully for about ten minutes, as it was not unusal for Corny to act quirky, however it became clear that this was not one of those instances. As Mike went downstairs to call the emergency vet, I remained with Corny at the top of our stairs, and I became visibly emotional. Corny looked at me with very wide eyes, rolled for me, then put his head forward to mine and began purring. I took his gestures to me as a sign that everything was going to be alright.  By 9:30 PM, after driving forty minutes, we arrived at the nearest emergency vet. They immediately examined Corny and believed that his labored breathing was not so severe and that perhaps it might be caused by asthma or nerves. We happily took this explanation, as Corny was indeed a nervous cat, and we sat in the waiting room and waiting nearly two hours for the full examination. The Vet ER was VERY busy that night -- lots of dogs coming in and needing immediate medical attention because they were bleeding and required stitches. While we were waiting, I read some of the "thank you" cards that were posted on one wall. I was a bit confused as to why so many cards were received, but I didn't pay it very much attention.   At 11:30 PM, we entered an exam room where both the doctor on site and the nurses could examine Corny more thoroughly. By this time, his breathing became a little more labored, yet still nothing to be alarmed about. The nurse took him and put him on oxygen to help calm his nerves. The doctor revealed to us that she would need to do some x-rays in order to determine the cause of his breathing problems.  After about an hour, which seemed like an eternity, the doctor came back with two sets of x-rays. First, she showed us the x-rays of a "normal" cat's lungs. Then, she showed us Corny's. His lungs had become so filled with fluid of some sort that the x-rays did not even show his heart. The doctor ran through a vast list of all the things that Corny could potentially have -- none of which could be considered "good". We hoped, at best, that he had feline leukemia, and believed that at worst, he had a cardiac disease. No one would know for sure until blood work and the examination of the fluid from his lungs was done. We agreed to leave him there overnight and to be back at 7 AM so the doctor could remove the fluid from his lungs and perform tests on him so we could have a better idea of what course of action we would need to take come morning. The nurse brought Corny back to us in the exam room, and I hugged him and told him that I loved him and that I would see him in the morning. He put his head on my wrist and just sat still. He seemed very weak, but he did his best to keep that brave face on. The doctors and nurses were shocked when they saw the x-rays because Corny's outward personality and appearance was no indication of how bad he was on the inside. As the doctor held him to take him to do tests, I told her that he gives hugs, and her faced warmed with a smile. She said that it is very special that he hugs because not many cats do. I knew he was in good hands.  When Mike and I arrived back home around a quarter after 2 in the morning, we called the vet to check on Corny. The nurse sounded like she was in good spirits and said that he was doing just fine. We confirmed that we would be back there at 7 AM, and decided that we needed to get some rest since we knew it was going to be a VERY long weekend.   At 5:45 AM, we received a phone call from the vet. She indicated that he was not doing so good and that after she removed the fluid from his lungs, he was difficulty breathing on his own. She asked permission to euthanize him because she was not sure that he would make it. We told her that we would be there in 40 minutes and not to do anything to him until we got there. She asked our permission to give him pain killers, and we agreed to that. She stated that she did not believe he would last for us to see him before he passed on.  We got to the ER Vet by 6:30 in the morning on Saturday, and we were immediately brought into an exam room. A minute later, they brought Corny to us, wrapped in a blue thermal blanket. The doctor explained that as soon as we got there, his breathing stopped, however his heart was still beathing so he could hear, see and feel us. I kissed his head several times and kept petting him and telling him that we loved him very much and I saw him looking at me. Then, I moved out of the way and pushed Mike into Corny's view. Mike did the same, and we pet corny until he died a few minutes later.   The doctor and nurses were very warm to us, and the doctor even hugged me. She explained that he was a very strong cat and that he waited over forty minutes for us to get there before we began to pass. She then explained to us what happened. Corny had a disease called  urlLink FIP . The fluid in his lungs were white blood cells, which were trying to fight the disease that had taken over his lungs. FIP is very rare, is virtually undetectible until it is too late, and nothing can be done to prevent it. Cats who have FIP die, and there is no treatment for it. FIP comes on just as suddenly as we saw it, and there are often no signs that lead up to the full blow out. We did the best we could to try to help him, however it was his time to go, even if it was so soon.   Although I had only known Corny for three of the six years he was alive, I became VERY close to him. He and I shared a lot of quirks and I felt as though we had a lot in common, even if he was a cat. The loss of Corny in my life is a major one, and I don't feel quite like I used to anymore. I feel like I've lost my oldest soulmate. I do have two other cats, and although I love all three of them equally, the loss of Corny is virtually devastating for me because I felt the closest to him.   I am just now realizing over the past few days how much he was a part of my life, in everything I did. Its difficult to use the computer because that's where he would be. Its difficult to get ready in the guest bathroom where all my makeup and hair care products are, because we would "talk" to each other while I was in there. Its difficult to just be in the house by myself during the day because he was such a constant companion for me.   Words can't express how much I love him, and words can't express how much I'm already missing him.

      And you know what? I'm excited about it. There is going to be between 7 and 9 people there -- depending on the two that RSVP'ed "maybe". That's a big improvement over the 3 to 4 that were showing up in the past... I wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that the location changed.  In knitting news, I began working on the  urlLink green cardie  for the third time. Third time's a charm, right? Right. And do you know why? Because I love it. I am about 4.5 inches in and, seriously, I don't plan on frogging it this time. I actually plan on bringing it to the knit-together tonight as an alternative to working on the things I should be working on.  Speaking of the things I should be working on, I'm really  urlLink running out of time . I think I just hit a really selfish knitting phase and I hope that if I make something significant for myself this time, instead of for someone else, that I will be satisfied to knit for other people without bitching and complaining to you poor folks who read this.  And, talking about time  again , I ran out of it today. Its just about 4 PM at the time that I am typing this and I spent literally all day working on a website. Not this one, but a different one. I was working so hard on it that I actually forgot to eat. When I was much younger, I used to think adults who said that they forgot to eat had some sort of freaky eating disorder, but now I'm starting to understand exactly where they were coming from. I think forgetting to eat while working is directly related to the consumption of coffee. Just sayin'.   You want to know what's really bugging me lately? The weather. I know. Its very lame to talk about the weather, but if you live in or around Jersey, then you know what I'm talking about. Every other day, its warm, sunny, and beautiful. Every other day, its cold. I think our local weather forgot to take its meds this week and its schizophrenia is taking over. Well, either that, or I've entered some warp zone that only me and my yarn know about.

      A lot went on over the weekend, and although all of it isn't knitting related, I'm going to write about it here. I mean, this is a knitting blog, however its about my life too, since my life does not solely revolve around knitting. I'm so NOT a one dimensional person! The one thing this entry is going to lack is links. The reason? I'm working on a laptop, and the less I have to go from window to window, the better!  Remember the green cardie that I talked about frogging my progess on last Wednesday or Thursday? Well, as Kate pointed out at the knit-together, I didn't frog it. I just couldn't stand to frog it until I had version two started. Sure, I had about three rows of version two started on Thursday, but I didn't really do any work on the project until Saturday night. Between Saturday night and Monday evening, I managed to knock out six inches of the back. *sigh* But, leave it to me, I don't actually like the way the seed stitch border looks with the body pattern. Figures, right? I started it, yet again, and this time I'm using K2P2 ribbing that will flow quite nicely into the pattern stitch of the body. I don't plan on frogging it this time around. And, the more that I do work on this sweater (all in all, with the amount of time I have spent working up the stitches, I would have completed about half of the project if I didn't keep frogging it), the more I realize that I am actually almost following one of the patterns that inspired me to knit this project to a T (The Oscar de la Renta "Dream Weaver" from Vogue Knitting Winter 2003/2004). So, this time around, I am actually going to just follow the pattern in the magazine for the back and sleeves, and then just modify the front and the turtleneck for a cardigan. The pattern that I wrote up for myself using the stitch pattern used in the Dream Weaver and the style that was featured on a Victoria's Secret Sweater and a Debbie Bliss Aran Tweed Sweater as inspiration on the form almost exactly mimics the Dream Weaver pattern as far as shaping goes -- which is the bulk of any pre-written pattern in my opinion. I don't know if that fact is a sign that I should have just used the pre-written pattern from the magazine from the beginning, or if my pattern writing skills are so freakin' awesome that they are comparable to pre-written patterns that are featured in magazines like Vogue Knitting. Interesting, huh? Anyway, I started casting on for this cardigan for the third time last night and just gave up because I was too tired. I plan on starting it (again) sometime today.  I also just realized that I have to have some things finished within the next two weeks, so I plan on actually knitting double time at this week's knit-together. Hopefully, I won't accidentally poke someone with a needle in the process. Mike has witnessed my double time knitting in person and has made fun of the faces I make and the fact that I kind of look like I'm beating someone up. He claims that it looks like I am in pain when I knit this way. Perhaps it will give everyone there a laugh.   I keep eyeballing the sale at webs, too, which is really, REALLY bad. I don't need any more yarn. Really. I'd love to have more yarn, but I just don't need it. I ran out of room to store yarn a LONG time ago, and part of this weekend was spent coming up with logical solutions to the dilemma that rings out loud and clear in this house. Although, it would be really nice to be able to grope alpaca. Oh well.   Oh, here's something sort of funny. Last night, after I decided that I was too tired to cast on 126 sts for the third time, I began playing around with some of my acrylic yarn and started making a sock. I have feet that could freeze hell and I am always wearing these insanely made socks OVER my regular socks when I am at home. After staring at these socks for about five minutes last night, I realized that IF these socks were actually knit by hand (they are clearly machine knitted, but whatever) they would have been knit on straight needles, starting at the top front, working their way down to the toe -- not using any decreases for shaping but by using smaller needles, then working their way back on the sole of the foot to the heel where shaping takes place by using smaller needles, and then would be knit straight back up to the top of the sock. Then, the piece would be seamed up both sides and a sock would be born. I'm testing out my theory now, and if my theory is correct, then everyone is getting a pair of these foot warming socks for Christmas. End of story.  The rest of this entry generally does not have anything to do with knitting, so if you aren't interested in anything that goes on in my life outside of what I have on needles, then you can stop reading here. Its okay. I don't mind if you stop reading. I take no offense by either action you take. :)  I mentioned earlier in this entry that there is an ongoing dilemma that takes place in my house. It came to a head over the weekend. Both Mike and I have these hobbies that we love doing. And, in order to have these hobbies, we have to collect things that compliment our hobbies so we can continue doing them. In my case, its knitting and yarn and needles and fashion magazines and shoes and coats and accessories. In Mike's case, its DVDs and games and action figures and most recently, gameboy advances. All of these things take up space, and its REALLY starting to show. Yarn turns up in every nook and cranny. Fashion magazines and loose leaf pages with notes and ideas are creeping out between the side of the couch and the side of the media shelves that contain SOME of Mike's DVDs. There are DVDs hanging out in front of the TV, and on the kitchen counter. There are handbags sitting next to the staircase in the foyer. There is a double doored closet in the second bedroom that is filled from the floor almost to the ceiling with action figures. The big closet in the master bedroom is exploding with clothes I want to keep "just in case" I'm ever a size 0 again, and shoes.  Ideally, Mike and I would LOVE to have our house look like, oh, say, my parent's house for example. You walk in to it, and its like walking into a museum. Everything is perfectly in its place, and not only that -- but you could even perform surgery in the deepest, darkest corner of the house because there is no clutter anywhere. Unfortuantely, Mike and I are realistic people. We know that our home could never be like my parent's home. The reason is because we have hobbies, and my parents really don't. I confirmed this theory this morning when I asked my dad what his hobby is and Pat's hobby is, and he couldn't come up with an answer. People who don't have hobbies don't keep things that clutter up their homes. And, if the hobby is something artistically related, then all bets are off. There is a reason why artistic people don't have the most clutter free homes.   (enter a dreamlike state here)  In the next house, we plan on building the place from scratch and equipping it with a room devoted to entertainment/electronics so that our living room doesn't have to be graced with a wide flat screen tv, and 6 point surround sound and so that our "loft/library" doesn't have to be graced with a computer that ALSO has 6 point surround sound. We also want to build a room devoted to our hobbies -- sort of like a craft room, where I can keep all of my knitting and craft paraphernalia and with room to actually practice these crafts (and where Mike can keep all of his action figures and whatnot) so those things don't creep out to the rest of the house. We also are planning to have recessed shelving built into several of the rooms also.  (end the dreamlike state)  Well, we aren't in the next house. In fact, we don't plan to be for at least a few years because we don't want to settle on a location or on the floorplans of the house. Right now, we are in a townhouse that doesn't have an entertainment room, a craft room, or recessed shelving. We are actually right smack next to a gaggle of english blokes who enjoy revving the engines to their ATV's on Sunday mornings at 10 AM. We are confined to the space that the builder has given us (thank god we bought new construction) and cannot put additions onto our unit. We just are not utilizing this space the way we should be, and this weekend, we decided to put an end to that. I mean, I really can't complain too much. The place is HUGE, has cathedral ceilings in both the living room and the master bedroom, has two full baths and one half bath, has a kitchen that is not only big but functional, and has a fireplace, a deck, and an attached two car garage. So, its sort of wrong to want more. Especially when so many people have so much less. So, here I sit, mapping out ways to store things differently (everything from spare silverware to clothes that I am keeping for sentimental value only to the buttload of magazines from the 20+ magazine subscriptions that we get). Wish me luck!  The other thing that came to a head was my issue with weight. Now, by no means would I consider myself a woman of size at this current time. But, I'm not the size 0 that I once used to be. Psychologically, this has had an adverse effect on me. Especially because I understand now that there is no way on God's green earth that I will *ever* -- or should have ever been -- a size 0. So, of course, about once a month, I have what Mike likes to refer to as a "fashion crisis". During a fashion crisis, I somehow find ways to try on practically every article of clothing that is in my wardrobe only to discover that nothing fits! All this just to run out to get breakfast! Well, Mike and I uncovered the catalyst of this "I don't have anything to wear" statement. In my generously sized walk in closet, more than 75% of the articles of clothing that were in there were in the size 1 to 3 range. More than 10% of the remaining articles of clothing are 1 to 2 sizes smaller than the size I wear now. That leaves roughly 5% of the clothing I own in a size that fits me -- which makes sence really. Those are the clothes that I have purchased recently! We are working on getting rid of all the "bad" clothes, and now my closet looks barren and sad. :(  On a side note to this story, as we were going through all my teeny tiny clothes, I started flip flopping back to "well, I think I *should* keep  this  for when I am small again," although I knew full well I would never be that small again. Of course, this lead not to a fashion crisis, but an "OH MY GOD I'm SO FAT" crisis that included statements such as "I *need* to be smaller for when we get married!" and "my hair is too short". Yeah. Don't ask how the hair ended up being part of this, but it was. Mike probably thought this was hysterical, and began saying things like, "Well, give me a timeframe for when you will be comfortable with your weight, etc" so that way he knows when we will be able to get engaged. Yeah. That stopped me right in my tracks too. I said, with a stern amount of confidence, that I would be ready in July. Hello? Am I smoking crack? Needless to say, I have to stick with the July deadline now, so I really have to get crackin' on losing some of my extra baggage.   If only I could find a way to knit while I was on the elliptical runner....

      I've decided to clean up the sidebar of my blog a little bit. Is it really necessary to list (almost) every project and UFO that I have hanging around the house? Probably not. I'm not completely sure anyone really cares about those things.  In the clean up, I've removed the  urlLink Liv/Kyoto sweater , mainly because now that I have my  urlLink green cardie  to work on. Chances are, I'll never actually finish that thing, but I'll keep it up in my  urlLink pictures (click on the link that says "WIPs and FOs")  just in case. Another project that I have removed from the sidebar is the  urlLink crocheted JS shawl . I think we all know that I'd never wear the damn thing. Alas, I'm keeping it up in the  urlLink pictures  anyway. The  urlLink Along Came Polly (but not really) shawls  said "buh bye" as well as the  urlLink Teal Feather and Fan wrap , the  urlLink Original Turkish Stitch Shawl , and the  urlLink Spring/60s Wrap . Again, these all can still be found in my  urlLink pictures , but they have no business being on the page of my blog.  Finally, the  urlLink sage sweater , which has been on hold for SEVERAL MONTHS at this point, is no longer in the sidebar either.  When I finally do resurrect these items, they will appear over there once again. But, for now, you can find pictures of those (plus other things) by following the "WIPs and FOs" link over in the sidebar.

       urlLink Last night  I had  urlLink SO MUCH FUN . Seriously. I got almost no knitting done (as usual), but this time, I mean it. Can you say  urlLink two rows ? We all spent the entire night talking, laughing, sharing stories, etc.  urlLink Anne  even had the honor of telling everyone how much it sucks to have me watch your  urlLink seat at a bar . The food was  urlLink AWESOME  and so was the atmosphere. We were practically the  urlLink only people  there the entire night. There was smoke, sure, but it was like a  urlLink fraction  of what we normally witness at the other place -- we could see the back wall! None of us really got any knitting done because we took the opportunity to talk and eat instead. It was so much fun. Eventually, we broke down and knit a couple of rows, but still. Have I mentioned that it was  urlLink so much fun ?  Anyway, I've decided that I am just going to suck it up and work on the  urlLink plain stockinette  pieces that I need to work on, regardless of how much I hate doing plain stockinette. I'm just going to use this as a learning experience for the next time I start a project that I think would look cute knit in st st.   I've also decided that I need to do something about my yarn. It has taken over the living room, the upstairs foyer, the downstairs foyer, and is slowly creeping into my bedroom. I would take pictures of this, but I just can't stand to have photographic proof of this disaster. I'm really running out of ways to store my yarn and still have it be easily accessible and usable. I've got it in super industrial large tupperware containers (plastic bins), and I've got it stored in beautiful oak and maple chests. That's not the problem. The problem is that I enjoy working on so many projects at once that I like to have everything where I can get to it easily. That means, I don't like having to open up and dig through bins of knitting. I'd much rather have it within an arms reach instead. What can I say? I'm a bit lazy when it comes to my craft. Ideally, I need a craft room, one which is designated for my supplies and where I can labor away without disrupting the rest of the house. Unfortunately, the town house association won't let me build on another room so I can accomplish this, so the craft room is being graphed out on the floorplans of our next home. I understand that most people enjoy working on one, two, perhaps three projects at once, and therefore are able to work -- no problem -- storing their yarn in these 'hide away' types of places. I'm not that kind of person though. Frankly, if I've got three or less projects on my plate, I'm not happy. The more, the merrier I say!  That said, I'm devoting this day to my knitting, not to knit, per say, but to devise a plan on how I can prevent this craft from taking over the entire house. Any knitting that is done today will only be done if I determine that it will help the clean up efforts that are being taken. :)

      Remember the post a few days ago about how I knit a sweater just to finish something? I frogged it! And, now I'm knitting it over again. Somehow, I've found great comfort in this -- I didn't turn into an  urlLink end product knitter  overnight!  Speaking of frogging things, I think that I want to frog the  urlLink green cardie  that I had been working on. Somewhere along the line (perhaps between  urlLink The O'Reilly Factor  and  urlLink South Park ), I goofed on a row or two. And yes, its noticeable. The cable crosses look more like they are  urlLink dancing  than crossing. Its rather cute, but it just wasn't what I was going for. I also think I would like to work this sweater in a more  urlLink seamless  manner. Why in the world did I believe that it would be a good idea to  urlLink attach  the wide hem of the sweater LATER, rather than begin with the hem and work it up from there? Or, perhaps I could have started from the collar and worked my way down. But, no. I practically started from the middle. Okay, it was three inches from the bottom. But still. Do I knit pieces the way I paint rooms -- from the middle out? Let's hope not. "Everyone" knows its  urlLink better  if you start from the top (or bottom, or corner).  The big question now is should I or shouldn't I? Such dilemmas I run into.

      Well, I'm breezing through my Charlotte's Web (v1) like its water. Or cake. Or whatever the correct analogy is for something like this. Its kind of funny because I botched the lace pattern very early on in the repeats and I decided to roll with it so my shawl for my special day will actually be special because it won't look like everyone elses shawl. For the second one I'm doing, I'm actually going to follow the pattern, no matter how much it hurts me to do so. I have no idea why I am so anti-pattern. Its almost like my rebellious inner child is trying to live out its teenage angst through my current hobbies. Interesting, no?  Anyway, I have one and a half lace repeats left before I reach row 154 and then I've got to block this baby. Although I am positive that I can breeze through these last bits of repeats before tonight, I'm not positive that the shawl will be finished blocking in time for tonight's SnB. And speaking of SnB, tonight I will be bringing two projects with me. First, the v2 of Charlotte's Web. And, second, this bag (well, its a tube so far) that I am crocheting out of kitchen cotton.  In non-knitting news, Anne and I went dress shopping on Monday and I managed to find THE ONE in under two hours. I would have been able to do so in under one hour, but the first dress I tried on took 30 minutes total to get on and off and required three sets of hands to do so. I'm excited. :)

      Caution: I may be speaking nonsence here, because I have a headache and I'm hungry, but this is a burning question in my mind and its not meant to confuse anyone!  I am currently into my second skein of yarn for my first version of the Charlotte's Web shawl. It is important to note that this first version of the shawl that I am making is being knit in ONE SOLID COLOR (#2181) because I plan to wear this for my wedding. Therefore, I have not had to change skeins to get the color effects that is suggested on the pattern. So far, my progress looks, well, quite large. It seems as though I will have knit well beyond the halfway point as I work through the second skein. So, now I am starting to think that perhaps, for a  solid colored  Charlotte's Web shawl, I did not necessarily need to purchase 5 (6 because I got paranoid) skeins of solid colored Koigu for this particular project. I'm rather stuck in my indecision because I cannot find the exact amount of yardage that is required to complete the body for this pattern  anywhere . I do realize that the pattern calls for 875 yards of yarn, however that 875 includes the total amount needed so that the fringe will be multi-colored as well. Working in one solid color, I'm concerned that I would actually need LESS yarn to complete the body and fringe, since the entire thing is a solid color. Is it possible that I need less than 875 yards of yarn (perhaps three or four skeins total opposed to five or six) to complete a solid colored version of this shawl?

      After a day filled with walking around Liberty State Park and playing wiffle ball with Anne and her family on Friday, I arrived home around midnight to discover that the Patternworks shipment arrived. And, do you know what that means? It means I received my supplies (yarn and pattern) for my Charlotte's Web shawls. I'll post pictures of the yarn and my progross so far on Monday because I am nowhere near the scanner right now. I've already started the first of the two shawls I will be making. The first one is being done completely in Koigu color #2181 because it is going to be the shawl that I wear at the wedding. So far, I am an entire skein into the first shawl, and I'm totally loving this pattern and I can now understand why so many people have flocked to it. What's even better about this pattern is that it isn't going to take me a year and a day to complete, so I actually have ample time to complete both shawls before the big day, contrary to what I thought originally. How exciting is that???  The second CW shawl that I will be working on is going to be using Koigu Multis: 319, 816, 613, 315D, and 515. It is going to be much more colorful than the one I'm working on now so I'm really excited to start that one -- but not until I finish the first one.   So, overall, I'm really excited that this pattern/yarn is working out for me and I'm even more excited that I get to make two shawls for the price of the ONE that I was planning on making earlier on. Go me and my thrifty-ness!  Well, I hope everyone is enjoying their weekend, and for those of you experiencing bi-polar weather like we are in Jersey, I do sympathize.

      Well, right now I am in the eye of the storm, as far as knitting projects are concerned. I am patiently waiting for my shipment to arrive from Patternworks so I can get started on one of the two shawls I need to have completed before  urlLink the wedding . Originally, I was very optimistic and believed that there was no way on God's green Earth that Mike and I could get  urlLink the reception place we wanted  for the end of this year and I was sort of banking on that so I would have lots of time to complete  urlLink the shawls . Ohhhh contraire, my friends. Turns out that our 1st choice actually has dates available. Guess I have to work quickly, right?   I've decided to put pretty much everything that had been in my WIP/UFO's list completely on hold so that way I can concentrate on the important pieces so that way they are done in time. The only problem I run into now is that I do not yet have the pattern or yarn in my possession, so I can't do any work on those shawls. The truth of the matter is that I wasn't planning on doing any knitting until I got those materials, but that's like telling a thirsty man in the desert not to drink the glass of water you are leaving out for the desert creatures. You know what I mean? I've decided to make a REALLY simple shawl. One that I don't even have to think about with basic increases and a garter stitch body, so I will have something to work on when I don't feel like thinking. I might actually mix it up a bit and do a  urlLink trinity stitch shawl  because I saw one on a tiny old lady at the grocery store yesterday who had a bright green one on and I fell in love with it. *sigh*  I'm such a shawl addict.   In other, non-knitting news, I've taken a liking to yoga (!!!) and I really feel as though it has helped me elongate and strengthen my body already. Initally, I was going to go the Bikram yoga route, but I have an aversion to heat. Its okay though. I've found that the Asana style of yoga fits me quite nicely and maybe I'll retry Bikram some other time.   I've also been inspired by spring (although in Jersey -- can you really call this spring?) and potted a couple trays of marigolds over the week. I also picked up a few new houseplants, as well as some tiger lily seeds, so pretty soon, there will be even more foliage in my house than there is now. If you are ever a guest in my house, and you encounter  urlLink this  or  urlLink this , don't be alarmed. I really am starting to run out of places to keep plants and those pictures from  urlLink this site  opened up worlds of ideas for me.  Anyway, its about 4:30 and I still need to get ready for tonight's SnB. I'm pretty excited. :)

      It is currently a quarter to two in the morning on Monday and I'm taking a break from learning more yoga postures to bring you an update. The truth of the matter is that after a good deal of time tossing and turning in bed, I decided to just forgo sleep until my mind stopped racing. That was over two hours ago. I'm doubtful that I'll get any restful sleep tonight. The worst part is that although my mind is semi-alert and ready, my body is exhausted. I attempted to work on some of my knitting projects, but my mind/body coordination just wasn't working. Oh well.   On Sunday, Mike and I spent six hours in our garage breaking down cardboard boxes, bundling newspaper and magazines, putting together these HUGE Rubbermaid storage things, and reorganizing the space. Since we do the majority of our shopping online, cardboard boxes pretty much took up half of a two car garage. It was obnoxious. Seriously, ask Anne. But we conquered that battle and we're moving on; we defeated the boxes and do not plan to allow them to come back. Chances are, we won't be doing much shopping until way after the wedding ANYWAY, but we can still pretend like we are holding our ground as far as the battle of the boxes goes. We ended up relaxing in front of the TV a couple hours later, which was when I realized that I am completely unhappy with this season of the Soprano's. To put it bluntly, if I hadn't invested so much time into watching the previous seasons, I would cancel the season pass that we have for it now because it went from "eh" to "what???" to "are you f*$%#%@ kidding me?!" within a matter of weeks. I'm just waiting for Carmela to find out that she is pregant so there can be drama about whether or not the baby is Tony's or the creepy schoolteacher guy -- both of whom she slept with this season. And, HBO, if you are listening, we  really  don't need to see Edie Falco naked. Ever. Please stop. Its traumatizing. On the other hand, I am constantly looking forward to Deadwood, which is probably the best show on TV right now, hands down.  As far as knitting goes, I guess I'm about to jump on the bandwagon and do a couple of the Charlotte's web shawls. The pattern was, in fact, on my list of "potential wedding shawls" that I had made several months back - prior to the gung-ho-ness that people all of a sudden have for this garment, however my first choice was always to do something with the Colinette yarn. As much as I would love to work with Colinette one day, today just  isn't  the day, especially when taking into account that Mike and I are funding the wedding ourselves, and we do not plan on chincing out soley because of that. If we wanted a half assed wedding, we'd elope or throw a BBQ. Choosing the Koigu over the Colinette is, financially, a good option because I can make two CW's for the price of one Colinette piece, so that means a solid off-white one for the wedding, and a more colorful one to take with me on the honeymoon. Score! I'm probably the only person in the history of knitting (!!!) to demand all off-white yarn to make this thing, but whatever. I'm a touch disappointed that this pattern had gained such unusual popularity, however I do understand why. The pattern is supposed to be ultra easy and it comes out beautifully with very little effort. It is, essentially, the perfect item to knit during a stressful time when you don't have a lot of time to devote to knitting. The order is going out sometime this week for five skeins of #2181, and one skein each of 319, 816, 613, 315D, and 515, all from patternworks.com. I do realize that everyone is gung ho on an alternate site to purchase from, however I'm not willing to chance a long turn around time on the order. I also need to mention that I am genuinely appreciative of Katie, who, on Thursday, alerted me of wedding thingies that I had not yet thought of, as well as let me touch her Koigu yarn, which helped me determine whether or not I could actually wear it up against my skin. :)  Am I excited about all this? No, not really. At this stage of the game, its just another item to add to the list. I've given up hope that I will somehow complete the green cardie sometime before summer officially begins, and most other personal projects aren't getting worked on either.  Well, its a little after 2:15 AM, so I'm going to go back and finish up my research on yoga postures and then hopefully I'll be able to get some sleep.  ... Edited ...  I just wanted to add that since Blogger now provides commenting, and my previous commenting host has been deleted (gasp!), I am going to respond to some recent comments that were left for me here.   Tina: Thank you so much on the congrats. :) And, I haven't seen you in a while... When are you going to come to the SnB again? Also, you deserve a congrats also. You scored awesome yarn at dollar store prices over the weekend. :)  Kathleen: Thank you on the congratulations. And thank you for the info on the ivory. Although I, unfortunately, will not be using Colinette for the project, I am happy to know that it does knit up well for future projects. :) Your Na Craga is BEEE-OOO-TIFUL as well.

      First off, I'd just like to say that I adore Blogger's new format. This is the first time I am seeing it since I haven't updated since late last week and I think its great.  Frankly, I really haven't done very much knitting over the past week or so. I've been quite the busy bee over here. However, I am going to be embarking on one of my most important knit pieces VERY shortly...  And, here's why --  urlLink dun dun dun !  I'm thrilled and excited, but most of all, overwhelmed! I've already decided that I want to make  urlLink this  in a wedding like color using the scallops pattern to use as a wrap. So... that's pretty much the pattern that this blog will be focusing on until the fall. :)  Happy knitting!

      Professionally... I am totally  urlLink stressed out  because I'm trying to get my business off the ground... Well, that's not true. I'm trying to get it to take flight because it already is off the ground, but the winds aren't too strong right now. I haven't had the opportunity to do things the way I would have wanted to do them just yet and its driving me nuts. The entire month of April was really stressful and put a HUGE damper on the productivity of the business. I'm dealing with a lot of issues in regard to the details, and I'm pretty sure that the people who knew, prior to this, that I was going into business do not have a clue as to the depth of which I am working. I don't want to sound like I'm being short with anyone I'm chit chatting with over IM or in Email, but  I'm REALLY busy  and I REALLY can't chit chat about little stuff because I'm a one man (woman?) operation over here and I'm up to my ears in details. Word? Word. And for those of you who I have outright neglected over the past week or so (Leslie, I'm looking at you!), give me a week or two and I'll get everything back to normal. There's just a lot on my plate and its important that I clear it all ASAP.  As far as I go, personally... This week is going to be a busy one. I'm somehow supposed to put together a family recipe book to give to the mom's on Sunday, except when I say "family", I actually mean "me, myself and I". Hopefully, the hard work will pay off. Oh, who am I kidding. Of course the hard work will pay off... I'm just not looking forward to doing that. The fact of the matter is that I probably won't do that for this year because I dont have enough time to make the actual books. I'm thinking about putting together a small indoor kitchen herb garden for next year's mother's day, so I'll have to get pretty matching pots, seeds and start using my green thumb for others. The "family recipe" book will probably go pretty nicely with the herb gardens... Complimentary recipes! And, uh, to keep this knitting related, I'll knit a kitchen towel, potholder or trivet to include in the little package. Hmmm... You know, maybe I'll just do this as Christmas presents for everyone, regardless of if they are a mother or not and call it quits when it comes to knitting things for other people for now on. I don't quite get the kind of joy that it seems like a lot of knitters and crafters get when it comes to other people. Am I selfish, or has a great swoop of reality come my way?   Crafty... I'm so not crafty this week at all. In fact, I'm finding that hobbies that would normally have soothed me are turning me into an angry beast! *sigh*  Hopefully, next week will be less stressful.

      This weekend was pretty good! I am trying my hand at crocheting (again) in order to use up this horrible yarn that I have (and can't stand). I think I like knitting and crocheting equally, but I'm cheap (and crocheting uses up way more yarn) so I'll probably STILL stick with knitting after this test project is finished. I also have been working on this OTHER sweater/cardigan. I'm not using a pre-written pattern or anything -- I'm just shaping it according to my measurements and using what I would consider common knowledge to complete the piece. Finished, it actually should look quite similar to the sweater that is discussed in  urlLink this thread , except the bottom ribbing on mine isn't nearly as high -- my ribbing is 3 inches, while the ribbing in the picture looks like it could be anywhere from 5 to 5.25" high. I was having tons of fun knitting that thing up but then I realized that little Nate will be born soon (in just about a month), and I still haven't finished the blanket I'm working for him.  On Saturday, we went to go see  urlLink A Perfect Circle .  urlLink Mini Kiss , who was sort of horrible, and an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE BAND FROM PHILLY,  urlLink Burning Brides  opened for them. Seriously. I wanted to shoot myself in the ears. My exact words to Mike when they came on stage and began playing was, "I don't need to relive the '90s, thanks!"  But A Perfect Circle was amazing, as usual, and Maynard was wearing a wig, as usual. The teenagers who flocked to the show were annoying, and there were several instances of me turning to Mike with sentences that started with, "If that was  my  daughter..." about the fashion choices of today's youth. Now, don't get me wrong here. I'm not talking about  urlLink the kids  with different colored hair who wear black. I'm talking about the kids that are walking around in  urlLink inappropriate   urlLink clothing  for their  urlLink age . Where are their parents????  Anyway, I'm glad I don't have kids yet. And, hopefully when I do have teenagers, I won't be forced to open up a can of whoop ass when they try to step out of the house in little mini skirts and halter tops.

      Since I'm going to be making these tomorrow, I figured I'd share at least the recipe with you folks who happen to read this journal. I commented with this recipe once in the LiveJournal Cooking Community, and I have yet to hear a complaint about the brownies sucking. The recipe is foolproof and they are your worst enemy if you are couting your calories, but they are totally worth it.   Nicole's Best Brownies EVER.   Ingredients:  2 Sticks Butter, at room temperature 4 Eggs 2 Tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil 2 1/2 Tablespoons Vanilla Extract 1 (12 oz) bag Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips (yup! the entire bag!) 1 Cup All Purpose Flour 1 Cup Granulated Sugar 1 Cup Brown Sugar 1/2 Teaspoon Salt Cinnamon to taste.   Directions:  1. Preheat oven to 350. Line your brownie pan with tin foil and coat with Crisco, butter, Pam or another greasing agent. 2. Melt the butter, the chocolate and the olive oil together and stir to combine. 3. In a seperate bowl, beat the eggs with the flavorings (the sugars, salt, vanilla and cinnamon). 4. Stir in the melted chocolate mixture to the sugar and egg mixture. 5. Add the flour and fold and stir until the batter is just combined. It is okay for the flour to still be somewhat visible. 6. Pour into your prepared pan. 7. Bake at 350 for about 45 minutes. It is better to under-bake your brownies than to over-bake them, unless you like crunchier brownies. 8. Let cool, then enjoy them without thinking about how thier nutritional content will mess with your daily dietary intake.

      Since I keep getting wind of this common anti-acrylic fiber theme amongst knitters, I feel as though I need to ask these questions for those of you who fall into that camp.  1. Open all your drawers, peek inside your closets. Now, look at the tags. Is every article of clothing in there a 100% natural fiber? I doubt everything you wear that's premade is 100% natural, so why are you such a hardass when it comes to this?  2. In reference to "special pieces", if everything you knit is made from the finest fibers you can buy, then how does one differentiate between the piece that is your typical project for everyday use and the piece that is made for a special occassion?   For instance, Knitter Acrylic makes her everyday projects using acrylic yarn. However, when Knitter Acrylic wants to make a special item for a special occassion or event, Knitter Acrylic uses non-acrylic yarns. Therefore, the project is even more special. On the other hand, Knitter Wool uses only natural fibers for everything. When Knitter Wool wants to make a special project, she still only uses natural fibers, so the making of the piece isn't quite as special because she is used to that caliber of fiber. Get it?  I mean, really now. Is it me or is this whole thing starting to sound a lot like grade school where it was only cool if you wore the brand name clothes? Its freakin' yarn, people. Get over it!  Its a hobby, not a competition.  Besides, if it WAS a competition, I'm positive that I could knit circles (cables? lace? short rows? I dunno!) around a lot of the people who use natural fibers only, ya know what I mean?    Be proud of WHAT you knit, not what you knit WITH.
