Can you tell I'm happy about this? Well, there are a few things I'm happy about right now. One is that Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon. Very stoked about that! Second is that ETFS sent me an e-mail asking about potential sales positions out here. Nice, hunh? I'm plannig to meet with them next month and chit chat about it. Thirdly, we have a new futon. Rose and got it for Mev and Aaron, and we're eventually going to use it as our TV-watching couch, once we get that N4 gadget. It's a nice futon. And finally, I'm loaded with caffein. I'm not sure that's such a good thing, but if it makes me act happy then who really cares, right?  I shoved some CSR's ignorance down her own throuat today. It was the first time I honestly felt like yelling "Don't you even  READ  your e-mails??!!" So I guess I'm kinda happy about that.  All in all, things are going well. Noting much to rant about today, just that Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon, Aaron and Mev are gonna be here soon.   w00t!

       Times of excitement!   Guess what? I hate registering my car. It's such a hassle! It won't be done until sometime next week, and it's ruining my day. I thought it was all going to be finished, and here I'm told, and I should have known better, that I need proof of ownership. At least the person who told me this was nice and understanding about it.  Has everyone heard about MSN? Apparently they're shutting down their un-monitored chat rooms because of all those pedophiles. On the one hand I feel like congratualting Microsoft on its decision to cut down internet cyber-stalking. Good call. However, as with everything MSN, there are ways around it, if you have the guts.   First off, only Microsoft Messenger will be allowed to access their exchange servers. OK, so goodbye Trillian (or as in my case, I'll just stop using MSN). But secondly, if you'd like to access chat rooms, you'll have to provide your credit card number. Their rationale is that pedophiles will think twice once their anonymity has been taken away. This is unlikely. Yahoo, AOL, and various other instant chat services will flourish, and these pedophiles will have new grounds to stalk.  I'm not suggesting a solution, just that the collection of personal financial information isn't a solution to this. Exposure of the ones responsible is. Make their names, not their credit limit, public domain, and things will change.  CYODFS

       Getting things done is the best part of starting anew. In something like 2 days, we've gotten almost everythi8ng we need to register the car done. It'sa amazing, really. The one thing that really, honestly, scared me was the speed at which the SAAQ (the Quebec DMV) responded to my request. I was really expecting it to take like 3 days or longer, but I got the response in less tha 10 minutes. For anyone whyo knows how the Quebec government works, they can tell you that this kind of speed is frightening!  WE're getting the "Out of Province" inspection on the car today. The inspection, which apparently has some meaning, although the people at the DMV here can't tell me a reason for it! They actually mentioned it being a money grab before I did. I'm just amazed...the cost of living out here is low, once you get everything set up. But since everything is privatized, it's efficient, but expensive.   Anyhoo, time to jet.  CYODFS

       Things that are new in Mike's life:  1. Wireless is good. 2. Got a clothes rack. w00t, indeed. 3. Got smashed last night and saw a chick poke a huge Husky in the ass. If you want details, you're gonna have to e-mail/IM me. (mikebougie1138@yahoo.ca , mikebougie1138 on Yahoo! IM) 4. Found a local owned/operated grocers with some great Lebanese food.  5. Found out that the week Aaron/Mev are going to be here there is an international movie festival going on, so there is something fun to do.  Overall, things are very, very good!  CYODFS.

       Deepest apologies to Aaron...I was meaning well, really, I was. We were so happy to hear that you and Mev are showeing up that we needed to talk and I figured that I could catch you at work. I'm sorry.  Rose and I are going out today to look at Futons for you guys. Well, not specifically for you guys, but for our second room which we can finally use as a second bedroom, and not just a room to put stuff in. We're making the place look great and everything will be awsome. We found a grreat gplace to go, and it's within stumbling distance, although it's kinda pricy. We know you'll love it.   Call us on our cell if you want to scream at me, but if they can you for something like that, they don't derserve you in the first place!

       Super psych-ed-ness Bat Man! Rose and I are so excited for the arrival of Mev and Aaron that we've begun massive reconstruction to our appartement of the trans mundane! We're stocking up on beer, we're getting a futon, and we're going to party like it's 1984....hey let's face it, this is Calgary. We're scoping out places to drink and car-less means of getting there. Gotta love the free C-Train! We're gonna eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow (or next week, whatever) they fly, and we'll be damned if they're gtting on that plane without a hang-over.  As to the whole notion of Aaron growing a beard, I think I've seen attempts at that in the past, and let's just hope he knows how to hold himself in a fight.   I got a new toy today. The Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop keyboard and mouse set. I'd include a hyperlink, but I don't know how to get them working, so what's the point? Picked up a few new DVD's last week as well, "Serpico" and "Falling Down". Great films for anyone who hasn't seen them already.  Anyhoo, time to hit the sack. Think I'll call Aaron to bug him at work.  CYODFS.

       Telus. I hate thee so. When thou ist running, thou ist slow. On those days of dark and fury, when thou art as functional as a Pavel Bure....i don't think I can rhyme anything with Pavel Bure.   Suffice it to say that Telus is infuriating me. For 2 days now I've beenw ithout access at home, all because the original registration process failed. For whatever reason, mine of theirs. Anyway, I got it working this morning. I've realized that calling tech support in the morning is a much better time than at night. I didn't have to wait at all, and had the whole thing resolved quickly. That and I got someone who knew what they were doing. Weird.  Rose and I have decided that gadgets and clothing need to take second place to registering ourselves as residents of Alberta. So we're switching the car and our medicare plans over to Alberta ones. I'm thinking that anything involving automobiiles out here is a scan. My car is a 2003 model. It's literally 6 months old, and because of that I have to take it for a 150$ inspection for an 'out of Province' vehicle. What gets me is that if it wasn't that new, it would cost  LESS . I don't believe this place.  Oh yeah, it's snowing.  CYODFS

       Yarg. As far as Mondays go, today was half-decent. Other than the fact that it's currently colder than sin outside, and that on my way into work this morning I heard reference to the fact that it may snow tonight. Snow! In mid-September! I feel like I'm being punished for something. Probably for all the fun I had this weekend.  We went out for Ethiopian food. To everyone out there who'se snickering, don't. It's wonderful, and doesn't taste the least like dirt. I had forgotten my basic anthropology, but I remembered as soon as I tried a fingerful (they don't give any utensils or individual plates...one large communal plate and a basket of eating bread) of sauteed lentils with marinaded chicken that this is food from, literally, the Cradel of Life. This is the food from where humanity began. And they got it right. It was delicious.  I had some red wine from South Africa with dinner. I didn't much care for it. I was later told that South African doesn't travel well. Then we must have a lot in common....I like being somewhere else, but I completely hate getting there. I don't travel well with others, either.  I was tempted yesterday. I discovered that Staples has a credit card. You can buy something over 400$ but under 1000$ and pay it off interest free within 90 days. This is NOT a good thing for me, since I'm looking at getting the N4, a wireless keyboard/mouse combo, a 32 Mb USB Flash device (I've just bid on a 128 Mb device on eBay, currently goling for 6.50$ USD) and the mother of all LCD's. Knowing that I can be extended a line of credit to do this is not something that is making me feel particularly budgetary. Those who know me, like my parents, are understandable upset.  There is a great article in the current issue of MacLeans all about blogging, and there are links to some interesting blogs. I encourage everyone to read it.  Time for some 'Mike-time' (read: time spent learning Red Hat 9 through the most awsome gift I'v ever received, 'Red Hat 9 for Dummies'. Rose, I love you so much.) I'm currently learning how to create a firewall.  CYODFS

       Hair of the dog that bit you. Weird expression. But it really works. Last night, Bob and San hosted a mother of a Bar-Be-Que. There was smoked ribs, beer, boiled and baked corn, veggie chilli, beer, turkey, salad, and beer. I think I'm forgetting something...in fact I'm pretty sure that I have forgotten something, but what the heck.   Anyway, I'm sipping a beer right now, and Rose can't believe it. I can't figure out why. It's not like I was completely trashed...or was I? Rose just said "keep in mind that your parents might be reading this" and I just realized that it was my family that introduced me to the concept of drinking, so I figure that if one can't be drunk around family, where can one drink?

       First off, congrats to Aaron and Mev. Good things really DO happen to those who wait. That and we'll be able to get retarded-drunk, maybe even the rare-but-hilarious Tucker Max Drunk when they show up. If you don't know what that is, go here:  http://tuckermax.com/bd.htm  urlLink    So they have a place to stay while in Calgary, and we're going to pick them up in Edmonton. We've never seen Edmonton, so this will give us chance to get some good things done...killing 2 birds and all that.  I really agree with Aaron about the whole "reason to get lazy ass outta bed before 3 pm thing". Thanks blogger. Ok, so I've added some links to my page, have fun. Now I have to learn how to add a hyperlink in the blog itself. So that I don't look like a dork with a blog, but intead look like a dude with blog-savvy.  Gonna go do just that...ah, who am I kidding, I'm going to watch the Simspons!  CYODFS

       As promised, bright and early, sleep deprived and kinda hung-over with a sink full of dishes, here I am, writing.   Last night was fun. Chris and Tara came over and we had lasagna and watched a movie, staying up till 2 talking. It was tiring, but rewarding. The down side is that I have been trained to awake fairly early in the mornings, so I don't get the luxury of sleeping in. Tomorrow I'll sleep in.   Anyhoo, I'm off to wash dishes. Joy.

I'll try to post some shots of it soon. As well, I'm _trying_ to pay for un-advertised space here, but that function never seems to happen. Oh well, whatever.

       Ain't new technology WONDERFUL? Just this afternoon, I'm trying to enter an order into the worse sales system ever designed. For those of you in the field, you might know the name: JDE OneWorld. If you do, I'm sorry. If you don't, some advice: if it is ever even hinted at that this will become a system you might have to use, quit and find another job. I shit you all not this thing has caused more problems than it is worth.  Just today I was without the ability to do anything more contructive than pick my nose for over 45 minutes while the IT team tried, desperately and valiantly, to find out what was the matter with this. To the rock-chopping Siberian drunkard who created this system, I have this to say to you: bastard.  I'm really enjoying this whole blog thing. I think it's swell.  If anyone has advice as to how I can update this via e-mail, please let me know by e-mailing me here mikebougie1138@yahoo.ca . I know it can be done (the help section told me so), I'm just not sure how.  For all you followers of geekulture out there (thanks for the term Adam, I like it!) I'm probably gonna get the ViewSonic NextVision N4 Video Processor. It's like a big cable box tha tI can plug into my stand-alone DVD player, VCR, and cable TV, and the other end into my monitor. I'm thinkin' it's the way to go. Here's the link, judge for yourselves:  http://www.viewsonic.com/products/video_box_nextvisionn4.htm  Anyway, peace out for the meantime.  CYODFS

       Well well well....I have a blog. Now all I need is a life that's interesting enough to make proper use of said blog.   Not that much can be said, really. I have simply created this as a place where friends, family, critics and cucmbers (I needed a C-word that was clean and I happen to like cucumbers a lot thankyouverymuch).  Rose and I would like to thank everyone who has been so very generous to us since our departure from Lennoxville. Aaron and Maria, Aaron and Mev, Bob and San, and of course Mom and Dad, and even Jo. Bill and Eva, Ian and Jane Ann, and everyone else that we need to mention but won't, thank you.  Rose is working at various temp positions in Calgary until late October, when she begins her position as reference librarian at the new Calgary Public Library. We drove out and saw the site, and it's going to be a massive edifice. A larger library I do not think I have laid eyes on since New York. I'm so very proud of her. I'm currently working at Shell Canada's head office in downtown Calgary, as an order agent on the lubricants order line. Not the most exciting of jobs, but it gets the bills paid and there are some interesting times. E-mail me and I'll tell you some stories.  Enough for now, just an introduction.

       Holy smokes today was exciting. Not only did Rose and I find out what flights we're taking into Halifax (it's only 3 hours away from Petitcodiak and 200$ cheaper), but we've gotten our car back! We got the call today, the 7 day repair marathon is done, and now we have a car that is brand spankin' new-looking.   This might be a feeling lost on some. I love my car. I missed my car. I really, REALLY missed my car. Nothing is worse than going from a nice, smooth, comfortable feeling Hyundai Elantra to a tank-ish, smelly, gas-guzzler that GM sees fit to call the Malibu. In fact, it doesn't even have bench seats! What's a Malibu without seats you can make love on?  But anyway, the rent-a-car is gone and our car, which is vastly superior in every which way, has been returned to us. Happy times indeed.  And to make things even more interesting, I have found something that I think you will all agree is tres cool. It's a replica of Sauron's ring, from "Lord of the Rings". I'm buying it as my gift to myself in a few weeks.  Oh yeah, and Rose has officially started her job at the Information Desk of the Calgary Public Library. She's really excited about it., and would love e-mails about it. Ask her how it is. Ask her what it's like. Ask her how she's enjoying it.  CYODFS

       So, I'm taking Rose out to dinner tonight to "The King & I". It's a Thai place we've been wanting to try for ages. Unfortunately, I didn't count on the long weekend delaying the arrival of my paycheque until tomorrow, or even Friday. This is not good people.  I don't even have enpugh to get her a card, but I took out what cash I do have, and that'll pay for the meal. I hope. I don't want to mess this one up. I'm planning on getting something very nice for her as well, and it won't be here until Friday, it's going to be a week of presents and cards and what-nots.  I really hope I don't screw this one up.  On top of that, the insurance guy hasn't gotten his stuff yet, which is making me supremly nervous.  Now the fax has started...oh well, no rest for the employed!  CYODFS

It's going to be nice having them around, but I'm somewhat curious as to how they will react to our very 'just-moved-into-town'themed appartement. And hopefully the futon is a good bed for them. I know it's strong enough, I'm just worried wether it's hard enough. Mom's back is really sore.  Anyhoo, it's 5. Quittin' time, so, as usual,  CYODFS.

       God do I hate this place. I can't wait to leave. Shell sucks. Well, not exactly. Shell itself, as a large, ungainly, corporate entity is fair enough. They pay great. It's the people I work with. I can't stand any of them. I want to quit so badly I can taste it.   I seriously advise anyone out there looking for a new job that, should one present itself, take a good, long look at the people who will be working with you. If they're more than 10 years your junior or senior, find another job. I shit you not it will keep you there longer.   Case in point:  I  work with a bunch of 40-somethings that are happy as clams doing something they have done for 5 years, and never having any room for expansion. I'm sick of being treated like I'm some kind of hoity-toity person just because, as far as I can tell, I have a degree and they don't. One of them was actually trying to make me feel bad by saying something like "You have a degree and went to school, but I bet you didn't know that." in regards to some pop-psychology e-mail being passed around. No shit I didn't know that, I have a Philosophy degree, not a Psychology one, retard.  These people are making every day suck, and I don't want to be in a place that sucks. Hopefully ETFS will hire me back. I loved working with them, it was fun and the people awsome. This place, well, it's my own, personalized, customizable, requisitionned, taboo-filled cubicle Hell.  Is it hot in here or is it just me?  CYODFS.

       Exhaustion. The plague of humans since the early days of Mammoth hunting. I have been surviving on less than 4 hours sleep for the last three days and it's taken it's tole on me. I can't think. I can barely talk. I'm pretty sure I'm hearing voices telling me to go to sleep. This is not good.  We've rented "Dog Day Afternoon" to watch tonight before we drive Aaron and Mev to the airport tomorrow, and I'm fairly certain I'm not going to stay awake during it. I only hope I don't snore too loudly.  Weird question: why do towels smell horrible after only three days of use? It's perplexing me. If you have any suggestions, they go  urlLink here  .  Last night we went to the Mongolian Grill. It's this really cool place where they styr-fry your food. And I'm not tlaking about "you're food" as in you order it, I'm tlaking about you go up to a salad bar and put everything you want in a bowl and hand it to them. The cooks then weight it, fry it, and serve it back to you. Very kool, and you can't complain that there's not enough of this or too much that. Very neat.  Anyhoo, time to recouperate.

       Things are good. Very, very good. Chris has leny me his DVD-R burner, so I've been archiving the episodes of  Star Trek Enterprise  and  Babylon 5  that I've spent a few months collecting. The upside is that I have all episodes of  Enterprise , and a season and a half of  Bab.5 . The downside is that I only have a 60 Gb disk. Which was, up to last night, really, really full. I've now got 14 Gb free, and I'm using Dr.Divx to re-encode the Babylon 5 episodes to something a little more mageable than 382 Mb per show.  I have to thank Chris for this. Not only did he set up my rig so that it's a lean, mean, ripping machine, he taught me how to use it. And he lent me equipment to do it. Thanks again!  Borrowing this stuff has given me a taste for DVD burners. I'm thinking of getting one after Christmas....150$ for a DVD+/- R. For anyone who doesn't know the set up, DVD-R and DVD+R are like VHS and Beta. Same over all format, but incompatible. So DVD +/- can record on both. Neat, hunh?   urlLink Chris and Mike this weekend (BMP Image, 700x242 pixels)   Anyhoo, time to run!  CYODFS

       Sorry it's been sol ong since my last post, but things have been kinda hectic around here. In fact, Chris and Tara are coming over this afternoon, so I'll have to keep this short. Chris is going to help me fix certain things about my computer that I don't know how to do, as well as showing me how to burn a DVD and rip one as well. I'm borrowing his DVD burner to back up the TV shows that I have accumulated and take up something like 28 gigs. At 4.2 Gb/DVD, it's going to take 7 blanks to back everything up.   That leaves me 3 to copy movies that I'm going to rent from Rogers. Any  urlLink suggestions?   CYODFS.

       So I've strted using the great little program called BitTorrent. From what I understand of it, it's distributed bandwidth file sharing. So instead of one file coming from one user. basically every user's PC is turned into a server. The files are linked through websites, and you jsut dowload them like normal files. Except that it happens exceptioanlly fast. Here's a  urlLink link  to a sample of the amount of stuff available. If you like BitTorrent,  urlLink go here  and get it. Upside is that it's fast. Downside is that it's not intuitive at all.  We got more snow today. I'm grumbling as I write this. There has been too much snow too soon. I saw a garbage truck fish tailing today. That was kinda cool. And now I've got a head ache, I'm sure from sitting in front of a computer screen all day. Why doesn't this place go LCD? For a company that has the wellfare of it's employees so well known, you'd think they'd be concerned with the amount of radiation we're absorbing on a daily basis.  CYODFS

       So I've planning an outing on Friday, if anyone decides to attend. One of our clients from Edmonton is going to be in town, and we're hitting the "Rose and Crown" pub on 4th. It'll be an interesting time, so I'm excited about it. I'm also way more excited because it's my first event like it. It's not going out with friends. It's going out with co-workers. Hopefully I won't come off as a complete retard. And hopefully I won't come off like  urlLink Tucker Max on Absinth  ... actually, that'd be pretty cool.  Foley, youhaven't written back to me!

       Mikey got a new monitor today. :) Well, it's new as in new to me. San got it from Nortel at a significant'y reduced rate (i.e. charity auction...she got it for 16$) and, for one reason or another, Bob's system didn't like it. So they gave it to me. Mike likes it. We can watch movies now and actually _SEE_ what is going on. Very convenient.  Ahhhh, the Grey Cup. Montreal vs Edmonton part II. This time, Edmonton won. Last year, it was Montreal. I have to admit that I wish we could have seen the game. I was very much looking foerward to it, but from waht I have gathered from other people, it wasn't all that spectacular of a game. It's odd...I'm not normally a posrts fan, but when the playoffs come, it's all suddenly really interesting to me. Playoffs and the Olympics. Bob came over last night (San was ill at home) and we chatted and drank and ate and drank. And then we drank. Let me put it this way: I was feeling mighty rough this morning! Wether that was the hangover or that memory of dousing my nice, beautiful, 90$ wirelss keyboard with beer, I'm not sure, but all in all I felt like junk until about 10 A.M.  Ahhhhh.....it felt like i was in  urlLink Lennoxville  again! Except taht it was at home with Bob, and not at the Lion with Aaron and Mev.  We miss you guys something horrible.

       So today is a day of missed opportunities and dissapoitments. There I was, walking through the TD Centre, on my way for lunch, when I look over and see some very beautiful young ladies sitting behind a desk signing pictures of themselves. "My that's vain" I remember thinking. Little did I know.  Seeing how it had been along time since my stomach had seen food, I decided to eat first and ask questions later. Having finished some crappy fast food, but happy since I saw my favorite turtles in the Gardens, I proceeded, full of curiosity, down to the table with the good looking vain ladies. They were gone. "Oh well, whatever" I think to myself.  So I go in and pick up a coy of  Wired  . Those of you know know me will think "Doesn't he get a subscription to that?" Yes, I do. They have not sent me a copy in three months, and since this one has  urlLink Linus Torvalds  on the  urlLink cover , I needed it.  urlLink Go here  to read it for yourself. But I digress. As I'm paying for the magazine, I inquire as to whom the nice-looking ladies were. "Them?" responds the clerk, "oh they're just some Penthouse Pets that were signing 8x10 glossy's of themselves if you bought a magazine here. You just missed them, they left about 5 minutes ago". Well, needless to say my jaw dropped and all manner of foul things found their way out of my mouth and into the ears of every passer-by within earshot.  Free pictures of Penthouse Pets, and I missed it because I was gawking at turtles. I'll never live this down.  CYODFS.

       So, it turns out that the Tomacco mentioned below has enough nicotine in it to kill a person, something like 50 or 60 milligrams. Something tells me we won't be seeing that at Safeway anytime soon, although C.S.I. could make an interesting story about it. The salad that kills.  As it turns out Shell might be making me an offer to become a permanent employee, seeing how the person I'm replacing has gone on to better things. I'm seriously considering it, despite all the misginving and bitchings I've subjected you all to in the past. There is a very strong money component to it, but for me that's never been a deciding factor. Instead, I need to like and respect the people I work with and have them do the same for me.   I'm also torn between a company that I loved ( urlLink E.T.F.S. ) and one that I have something of family history with ( urlLink Shell Canada ). If anyone has any advice,   urlLink e-mail me  and share it, please.  It's odd, but as far as I can remember, this is the first time that I've had more than one company sort of, in the smallest kind of way, inticing me to work for them. And guess what?

       Well, I knew it was going to be interesting. It all started when we showed up at the airport in Calgary and got in the wrong line. We didn't stay there very long, but it was going to be a sign of things to come.   We get to the right counter, only to be told by the over-worked and under-paid Air Canada check-in lady that AC 636, the flight indicated on our e-ticket, didn't exist. At all. Ever. She booked us on a flight that was an hour later, but then we missed our connection in Toronto, which was kind inevitable since she didn't book our luggage through to Halifax anyway. So we got our bags and went to the Air Canada client care centre (both people) and, after an hour of waiting, finally got a voucher for free bus rides to and from a free night in the Comfort Inn. Seeing how we had to get a 7 AM flight the next day, surely we would have gotten sleep to awake bright eyed and bushy tailed. So we went to the hotel bar and got wasted. Really, really drunk.  After 3 hours and 4 pints, and a Pizza Pizza pizza later, I manage to get an hour's sleep. Waking up at 4 AM still drunk isn't fun. It's even less fun when we have to get on a cold bus to get to an airport to catch  a plane. Ouchie.  So we check in, and get in line to board, when our names are called over the airport-wide loudspeaker, even though we're only 5 ft away from the person calling our names. Apparently, Air Canada was really, really sorry, and decided that they would bump us up to Super Better-than-everyone-else-class. Also known as Executive class. So the ride to Halifax wasn't all that bad, but it was close. Remind me to not use travel agents at all anymore.  Anyhoo, we're alive and well, and with Eva and Bill. Their house is beautiful, their hospitality amazing, and things are good. Apparently I'm going to Fredericton tomorrow to meet some of Rose's relatives. Should be fun!  Ian and I went to see ROTK ( Return of the King )   tonight. Great movie, but certain things needed to be explained more. Like the reason for 5 false endings. But other than that, the film was awesome!  Well, that's all for now.   CYODFS

       Well, in my defense, it is a valid argument, innit? If you can't keep plants alive, a pet isn't for you! That and the near-dangerously violent allergic reactions I get to pets really doesn't appeal to me. Which reminds me that I need to get some antihistamines before heading to N.B. for the hollidays...which is freaking me out 'cause it's only 1 week away.  Sweet Maker I can't wait. It's not taht I don't enjoy Calgary, it's just that...well, I'm tired of it right now. I need a break. I'm tired of the mentality out here, but more specifically, I can't wait to have a week go by during which I don't have to see my co-workers!  And I think the bamboo looks kool.

       Rose says:  "Master and Commander" is a really fun movie. Definately worth watching in the theatre (even if your local IMAX wants to charge you 20$ for the privilege!) I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone who actually knows anything about the Napolionic wars, though. And by "anything", I mean little things such as , oh, who was fighting whom.   MIke has told me we can't get a cat because I can't even keep two sticks of bamboo that grow in stagnant water and I only have to water once a month alive. Hey, in my defense, it's a dumb-looking thing that doesn't grow anyway. Who cares if it doesn't grow in shades of green or shades of brown?

       Rose says:   hahaha! Isn't that exciting? Just put two boys together with some computer stuff and watch them go!   Brr!... it's cold and snowing here today, but I guess I can't complain since Mev and Aaron have told us that they're at -40 up there in the NWT.  Yikes! Hang in there, guys, just think of how great the summer will feel!  I want to share a really great veggie stew recipe I tried on Saturday. It turned out really well, and is dead easy to make more or less of, depending on who you're feeding:   Ingredients:  1 tblsp.  each dry majoram, basil and parsley  1/2 tsp grated lemon zest salt and pepper 4 tblsp. softened butter 8 oz. frozen chopped green beans 1tblsp. olive oil 1 small finley chopped onion 1 chopped garlic clove 8 oz diced summer squash or potato 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1 small can crushed tomato (about 1 cup) 3 cups corn kernels (canned or frozen)  In a small bowl combine herbs, lemon zest, salt and butter. Set aside.   Cook the beans uncovered in boiling water for two minutes. Drain and set aside.  Heat the oil in a large pan with onion and garlic. Saute for one minute. Add 1/2 cup water, lower the heat, cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the beans, squash or potato, pepper tomato and corn and salt to taste. Cover and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes or until tender. Stir in the herb butter and season with pepper. (All credit goes to Deborah Madison in "Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone").  This recipe turned out really well for me. If I made it again, though, I might add some crushed chilis. Yum! Maybe I'll make it again tonight since it's so grey and snowy today! (And since I have so much free time on my hands... grr!)

Like this guy who's been trying to plant pipe-bombs in people's cars for the past week, but they're so shitty that all they do is knock the car's bumper's off.... and then there's a gang of people, 3 guys and a girl, who've been going into bars at closing with masks and baseball bats and tying up the bar staff, but only getting away with a few bucks because they show up after the nightly deposit's been done, or they believe the waitress when she lies and tells them there's no money in the cash. They've done it, like, three times now. Hehehe... and the inspector who's always doing press interviews about these, his name is "Inspector Bailey", and he is such the typical little french detective.... hahaha! I love this town...

       I never thought I'd be happy to see snow! We got about 4 inches yesterday, and it's really nice. Part of the incentive for moving here was that the winters were really mild, but I've decided that I'd much rather have snow and cold than the horrible rainy grey days we've been having so far. Calgary has been one big grey mushy mess until now, so I'm actually happy to see snow. (you might have to remind me I said that in a week or so, though!).   Mike and I actually found some culture out here the other day. For Christmas, the sweetie bought me tickets to a show by the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, featuring  urlLink Dee Daniels . It was awesome. The  urlLink CPO  is actually world-renowned, and a very exciting show to see. And if you've never heard Dee Daniels sing, you're missing something wonderful. She's a jazz singer from Vancouver, and has preformed with many big names, even for the Queen of England. All I can say is she's amazing to hear, and you should seek her out.   It's -30 degrees celsius in Calgary at 4:00, and this is Rose, signing out.

It's hilariously awsome, and very 1990's.   But basically I crashed. Didn't drink (OK, maybe 1 beer) and then crawled into bed at 21.30. I woke up at 6.30 feeling like a zillion dollars. It felt great.  Nothing too much tonight, just updating the media list mainly.  CYODFS.

       I asked Sonia, my co-worker today if it's a bad sign that I'm very much looking forwad to spending tonight sober. She confrimed that it was in fact, a very bad sign. I'm beginning to think that she was right. 'Just once', I remember thinking last night, 'I'd like to go to work refreshed, awake, and not hung-over'. Oh well,  c'est la vie  as they say.  There was a moment of panic at the office today. Ususally we function very well with a group of 4. We can function adequately on 3. Trying to do it with only 2 proved to be somewhat challenging today. That, and to boot our  urlLink system , piece of crap that it is, wasn't working.   I hate Mondays. I hate being half-staffed.

There is a very important discovery I would like to report: sadly,  urlLink Bawls  doesn't go very well with rum. Not very well at all. Batri suggested vodka, but I'd venture a guess that it goes even worse.   I have to keep this one short, but props have to be sent out to  urlLink DJFreq  for his mix,  '4 gin and tonics and a pile of tunes'. It's been in my CD player for about, oh, 4 months now, and just keeps getting better. Way to go! It's a collection of some of the best house you'll ever hear, and if anyone wants either a copy or a history of it, just  urlLink drop me a note  and I'll hook ya up.  Anyhoo, time to crash, the guarana is wearing off. :(  CYODFS.

       So something really odd happened to me today during my belated lunch hour. I was wandering, pointlessly, when I was walking past a skanky-store called  Dynamyte . I call it skanky only because the three hoochies behind the counter looked like, collectively, the worst case of ghonno-herpa-syphi-litis that I have ever seen. Boobs hangin' out like a pinata, lipstick covering the herpes, and hair that looks like it has been through a German porno.  What drew me into this den of obvious moral degradation was the music. As I was walking by, I heard a divine baseline. It was calling me into the store. I *had* to know what it was.   So I walked up to one of the Over-The-Counter-Hoochies and ask, "I'm sorry, this is a weird question, but what disc is playing right now?" To which she (Skank 1) gave me a look of utter confusion that could only be rivaled by a cow looking at the sledgehammer right before it smacks it between the eyes. After about 10 seconds, Skanky McSkankerson (Skank 2), obviously drunk (or just inbred, this  is  Alberta after all) comes up and "This is Britney Spears!!" in a tone that hides neither contempt nor harm. She was honestly surprised, and even offended, that I didn't know that Britney "I'm the Sluttiest Virgin on the Planet" Spears was playing.  Then the weird thing happened: McSkankerson leans over the counter, with her acne-potmarked cleavage, looking like the future Mars landing site, practically hanging out, and says "Do you like it?"  Now, I hate Britney Spears. With a passion. If you gave me the option of living debt-free for the rest of my life or being able to bitch-slap that child-corrupting media whore back to the stone age, I'd get out the Ace bandage and start-a-slapin'. Really, I would. So I responded the only way I could think of: conjuring up all the hate, fear, and general anger that I have been holding in all day at work, I put on the most suprised/offended/are-you-a-complete-retard-? look on my face and reply "No, I don't listen to crap."   Then as I left, I could feel their eyes on my back as I walked away. I was instantly feeling better about being me.  CYODFS.  Rose Says:  Hmmm... do I detect just a *hint* of pent-up emotion in regards to this subject? Holy pop-star, batman! I guess I should take that sexy outfit I bought for tonight back to the store!

       Rose says:  The other night Mike and I went pub-exploring and came up with some fairly fun spots! We've been depressed by the fact that we hadn't found a good place to hang out that wasn't a 20-minute drive away. I guess it just takes a little looking (thanks to Serena, who made me a list of places to try).   We started at the Elephant and Castle, which is downtown, under a big shopping mall. Although it's big, it still pulls off being quaint. I do find it strange to walk into the old-english style pubs around here and not be greeted by a cloud of cigarette smoke, though.   After a drink or two, we walked the 10 blocks home along 8th avenue. It was cold. We decided we needed a little liquid warmth on the way. We stopped in at the Flying Emu, an Australian joint that serves domestic beer at $7 a pint... despite this fact, we enjoyed playing pool and making fun of all the hip old men. Hurray for drunken people-watching!!  I've decided that having a nice, safe pub to hang out in is one of the important things in life, and may affect my next choice of places to live.

       So, the system is down at work right now, so I've decided that now is as good a time as any to do some blogging.  Last night I had a very scary experience: I realized that I had lost a day. At 1 AM, corked, I was thkinking to myself "I'm really happy that it's Sunday tomorrow" only to be told that it's Sunday today, and that I had to go to work today. That made me cry. After spending all afternoon and evening working on  urlLink Prometheus , (not the Titan, but the name I've given my computer) I was really looking forward to a few hours of fiddlin'. The reason for so much work:  There was a bad sector in the MBR and since I don't have a floppy, Chris and I went to UofC to fdisk and repair it. Translation: really important thing really damaged.  I just got news that  urlLink this  arrived. Holy fast BatMan, it was only ordered Thursday! Hopefully it will dramatically reduce the decible level of my computer, hence making movie-watching an enjoyable experience again! And when it is coupled with  urlLink this , hopefully  urlLink Prometheus  will be running nice a smooth, and silent as a gentle breeze.   Well, I think I'll try and do something productive. All though I don't know how, really...  CYODFS

       And let's not forget the charming way the locals here show affection for you: by revving their broken-down rusted out shit boxes and flashing their high beams. Oh! And the homeless people who panhandle...I love them...the charming way they smell like Scope, the affectionate way they stalk you until you give them change. we love this city...really, we do.

       Rose says:  When we first settled in out here, my sister sent me a very kind, caring card with a little advice included. "Never trust anyone who's belt buckle is bigger than his brain". I laughed at the time. Little did I know...   Recently, I've observed several unique events which have made me realize what a truely *special* place Calgary is. (Details may have been altered):  a.) The other night, while enjoying a refreshing beverage at a fine local establishment, we noticed a group of excited individuals gathering around one end of the bar and cheering. There was a competition taking place. Between the woman opening bottles with her teeth, and the gentleman opening them with his 6-inch, bull-shaped belt buckle. I felt privileged.   b.) When leaving the corner store the other night, I was forced to skirt around a beautiful specimen of a car which had squealed to a stop right in front of the steps. The late-80's firebird type car was revving it's engine impatiently, which caused me to admire the spray-painted pink racing stripes on the side, cleverly camouflaging a strip of rust. The clean-shaven, nice-looking young man in the driver's seat was calmly sipping a beer while waiting for his lady friend inside. I was touched.   c.) While walking down the street yesterday, I noticed an individual sitting in a wheelchair on the sidewalk with a few coins in a hat in front of him. I also noticed the (again) clean-shaven, nice-looking young man who walked up to him, asked him if he would like a beer, pull one from his jacket pocket and hand it to him. I thought that was a nice gesture. If I'd had a beer in my purse, I would have offered him one, too.   These are true stories, I shit you not. But, before anyone gets too angry at me, I know that these scenarios could take place anywhere. I don't mean to be catty. I'm just amused.

       Sorry for the previous posting, but it  was  New Years and I  was  drunk, and I felt that someone needed to know that.   First things first:  DJFreq, I love your  urlLink page dedicated to (Lt.) . I was busting a gut reading it. Everyone should go and read that right now.  So for New Year's Eve Rose and I decided to see  LOTR:ROTK . It was even better the second time. I have to agree with Freq's critique of it: the ridsers from Rohan showing up, and the fear showing in the eyes of the Orcs, was awsome. Moving. Momentous. Braveheart -esque .  I found the part when chickie-girl takes off her helmet and states "I am no man!" to be more than a little on the cheesy side. That's not Jackson's fault, however. The Wraith-General should have been brought down in a battle with Gandalf, like everyone was expecting, not on a mere technicality.   But other than that, I really, REALLY enjoyed this film.  So, guess what? Anyone who knows my track record with Christmas will know that last year, the flu got me just as we were leaving New York City. Well, it caught up with me in New Brunswick. Big time. Again, in a mini-van. When I called homew to let them know this, it was too much. I could hear my sister, loving and caring human being that she is, laughing hysterically in the background, while my own mother could barely contain the laughter in her own voice. Not that I blame them.   But it got really sad when Rose caught it on Christmas Eve. That hurt, since she missed her father's sermon at midnight mass. I really feel bad for her. But we got better and had a great trip. I made out like a bandit at FutureShop: a small, cheap digital camera for 60$, 2 DVD's for 35$, and a 160 Gb hard drive for 200$ minus 70 $USD mail in rebate. Yeah, Mike's happy.  But right now it's lunch time, so I'll write more later.  CYODFS.

       So, I've been told that since this story is so funny I need to include it on the blog.  There is a store in Calgary called  Ribtors . It sells pretty much everything you could possibily need that's not food. Camping supplies, hardware, everything. Sadly, it's close to the dis-reputable end of town, where the "Ladies of the Night" gather. That's right folks, this one deals with prostitutes.  So I'm driving around like a chicken with no head, trying to find this store. I drive across an intersection and I see it off to my left. I look ahead and find myself in a cul-de-sac, with a working-girl coming my way. I motion to her what I think is easily interpreted as "No offence to you or your pimp, but I am not currently soliciting the use of a sex-trade worker. But thank you for you interest and all the best to you."   Now, I can only assume that she interpreted this as "Go away you pathetic specimen of humanity, I am far superior than you are and I pity you." Which is exactly what I did *not* want to convey, because I don't like offending anyone, and especially not prostitutes. I say this because after my word-less statement of "Thank you very much but no thank you" she flipped me off. With both hands, and a very visible  F-U-C-K Y-O-U. For those of you know follow the WWE, think of Stone Cold Steve Austin giving someone the double kick-stands before beating the snot out of them. And then she started coming towards my new, shiny, very nice car. The same car that I very much did not want damaged.   So I slammed my foot in the gas and peeled away like a Nascar racer on the inbound 273rd lap. Right across the street, into a parking lot.  Where I stayed for almost 15 minutes, as the prostitute paced around. I can only assume that I had crossed some kind of territorial line, because she didn't come after me. Thankfully. Her nails could have ripped the paint right off the car, I'm sure.  So this is my story. I hope you have enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed telling it, and let me close off by saying that whatever you do, please, don't make hand signals to hookers. It's just not worth it.

       Ouchie.  So today at lunch I deceded that I wanted to go for a walk and feed the ducks. Or did I want to work out? Walk...ducks...exercise. All three presented me, almost at the same time, with their best reasons as to what to do. I got half-way to  urlLink Eau Clair Market  when I think to myself "You should go exercise. You haven't been in 4 days." The argument that I should have used in response to this was "Yeah, I'll rush through a work out and be in lots of pain all afternoon".   Did I? Nah.   So I went. I worked out fast. I worked out hard. I spent the afternoon, at leaset until the moment of this writing, in pain.   And I'm *paying* for this.     CYODFS.

       So we hope everyone has been enjoying our blog. Sorry we haven't been updating it as often as we probably should be, but things have been going so...um...much lately that we just haven't had time.  Some developments: Rose got a job at Ten Thousand Villages! Hooray! 10K.V. is an art store that sells their merchandise at a fair price, which is then passed on to the artisan who made it. She's volunteering 4 hours a week, but hopefully she'll get a lot more time once they find out how great she is at it!  As for me, well, pretty much the standard fare: work is really getting to me, I've lined up some interviews week after next. There are a few places that sound interesting, but I'm not so sure they can compare money wise to Shell, and right now we *really* can't afford a drop in income. We're barely scratching along as it is.  Actually, I lie. Things are going very well. Sure, we don't have thousands of dollars saved up yet, but that's not the most important thing, is it?  Well, Rose just came and told me to get off the computer, so I'll post more tomorrow. I'll tell the story of my new videocard and all the fun stuff associated with it.  CYODFS.

       Ah.....the feeling of exercise! For the past week and half, I've been taking full advantage of the 'Active Living Centre' at Shell. This is basically the fancy name of a gym. That's right, Mike's been working out! This is a consequence of a slight revelation that I had two weeks ago. Now I realize that quite a few things were wrong with this experience, but nonetheless it got me thinking.  What happened was that we went to a 'junk store' near by called  Choy's . You know the kind of store I'm talking aobut: full of stuff that has, sadly, outlived it's usefullness yet was too sentimental to throw out, so they sell it to Choy. It's Korean, North or South I'm not sure, but it doesn't smell ike steamed dog so I'm guessing it's South. But I digress: there was a bathroom scale there. I was dressed warmly, which involed wearing my winter coat. My winter coat is heavy. Really, really heavy. And when I start putting stuff in the pockets (cell phone, wallet, keys, pen, papers, etc...) it gets even heavier. Dumb as I was, I got on the scale, and was horrified to see it inch towards nearly 95 kg!   Now I've been told by quite a few people that this scale must have been a little 'wonky'. Thank you all. But aside from the obvious wonk of it, I still got the feeling that it should have showed something less. So I decided that it was time to finally do away with the last remnants of my  urlLink Bishop's  days, and get rid of that 'Frosh-15'.  This is a term used to refer to the inevitable weight gain suffered in the first semester of nearly every Canadian university students. It comes from doing nothing but sitting in calss, drinking beer (at Bishop's, these two are done sometimes at the same time) and eating side-dishes that were nothing but potatos. Beer, potato side dishes, and sitting do  NOT  make a good combination.   So I've sarted working out. Weights and cardio on my lunch our, delegating the eating of said lunch between calls at my desk. This is difficult, but manageable.  Anyway, that's enough from me for now.   CYODFS.

       Wow.   Fridays around here get very boring, and for some reason they get cold, too. I'm cold. I was cold last Friday. I  never  get cold. What's going on here? I have a headache, I'm cold, I'm not getting my case until Tuesday, and I feel just a little sleepy. Fridays are great, arn't they?  On the plus side, I have lots of time to ponder purchases. I will need some 120 mm fans for the case, and I'm not sure which ones to go with. The Vantec Stealth fans are good, at only 28 dBs, but there are some really good AcoustiFan that are variable and temperature controlled that can clock in a lot lower depending on the amount of air being moved through them, called CFM, or Cubic Feet per Minute. A high CFM means more air which gnerally means more noise.   I dunno, I'll have to ponder it a while. Good to know the  urlLink USA can't always get it's way , though.  CYODFS.

       It's, as it usually is, been a long time, has it not?   I was just avoiding work today and I stumbled across  urlLink this article . The one I read was from  urlLink Yahoo! News  but the overall idea was the same: DVD burners have gotten bigger. Again.   Here I was feeling very comfortalbe in the fact that in the next few weeks I was going to upgrade not only my case from  urlLink this  to  urlLink this . Seeing how things go from there, along with 2 x 120 mm ultra quiet temperature controlled fans, I will install some of  urlLink this  and Prometheus will finally be silent. Speaking of which, anyone want that old case of mine? I want to find it a good home and I'll trust someone who reads my blog.  And after all that I was going to invest in a DVD burner just for the fun side of it. What does this have to do with DVD burners? I'm not really sure but I know that it doesn't have anything to do with    this guy.  I wish I oculd say that this past week has been incredibly, wonderfully, amazingly exciting. Well, technically I could say that but I'd be lying. Things have generally calmed down a little bit. Droo, April, Rose and I went to dinner and a movie on Saturday night. We went to  Elisabelle's , this newly opened Quebecois restaurant right downtown. I had smoked meat and poutine. It was wonderful and glorious. Then we went to see  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . It was, surprisingly, a great movie. It's definately one of those movies you have to see 2 or 3 times just to understand what was going on. Or was that the beer and the ceasar? On the way home I bought a crack addict. A hot dog. I bought him a hot dog. It's not like I went to Crack-Addicts-R-Us and asked for a not-so-smelly one. Although that would be good for a few laughs.  Oh well, never mind. It's a good movie, everyone should go see it.  Mom, Dad, we really miss you and can't wait too see you. Dress warmly. But not too warmly. Eva and Bill, we're also looking forward to seeing you in October! Again, dress warm. No negation this time, it's gonna be c-c-c-old when you're here!  As I can tell from the time indicator on my telemaphone, it's time to leave.   CYODFS.

       Sorry I didn't finish posting last night. I had to relax a little. This whole situation just gets me so mad!   It's when I read articles like  urlLink these  and  urlLink these  that I get furious.   These people are scared, and their fear is manifesting itself into hatred. Outright, indescriminate, unbridled hatred, of file traders.   The CRIA, RIAA, and MPAA label us 'pirates' and 'theives'. Right, like charging 26$ for a movie that has already made 250,000,000$  isn't  theft. The argument of the music industry? That downloading a song, or an album for that matter, is hurting the artists. It's always about the artists. Then why doesn't Aerosmith come out and say 'Stop it, you're hurting us?' Because we're not! What is the likelyhood that Steven Tyler et al. are going to end up broke and out on the street? Less than 1 : 1,000,000.  The artists that  should  end up on the street corner, but never will, since we're on the subject,  are the Britney "I'm the only virgin with chlamydia" Spears and all the other skanky "I'm a woman (even though I'm only 16) hear me roar (but not ludly enough to make anyone look, just loudly enough to be cool, which is just the same as being annoying)!" that are sending the wrong message to teens and kids today, namely that being overtly and overly sexual at age 7 is ok. It's not, and don't give me the 'freedom os expression' crap. How many pedophiles have been tracked in the last, say, 5 years? Who in North America doesn't know what an AMBER alert is? This problem hasn't been steadily growing for years, it has exploded. Anyone who tries to tell me that is going get a earful, and quite likely a filling of quite a few more orifices while they're within reach of me.  Fortunately, there are articles like  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one  that give me just a glimmer of hope. Announcements from companies like Rogers stating that they will, under any circumstances, divulge the identity of their internet users, is a good start. But instead of banning downloadable music and DVD-copying software, why not change tactics. Taking a page from  urlLink  Wired   :  1. Legalize and tax downloadable music. Think 25¢ a song. How much volume would that generate? More than any CD sale at HMV.  2. Have Blockbusters and others around the world offer to copy a DVD for you for 1$ more than the cost of a rental. If you don't like it, you're out a few bucks and you've got another coaster. If you do, hey, rock on.   I realize that this is a mega-rant, and if you've made it this far, then thank you. You now know just that much more about what makes me, well, me.  My name is Mike, and I am a file-trader. You can stop  me , but you cna't stop  urlLink us .  CYODFS.

       It's been a while, hasn't it?  Sadly, there have been no new, wild adventures in Mike's life. I'm not so sure about Rose's, however. She maintains that there is nothing exciting going on, but I don't believe her. I bet she's off galavanting around town, helping out people who need a hand, generally being well-disposed to, and boldly splitting infinitives that no one has split before.   If this is the case, she hasn't told me about it.   Last weekend I helped my friend Sonia get her DVD+/- RW working. I'm quite proud of myself, especially how we got around the CSS. For those of you who don't know, CSS is an encrytion sysyem used on DVDs to prevent people from doing exactly what we were trying to do. It was pathetically easy to do, so I hope the film industry didn't spend too much cash on CSS. Apparently its almost as big a failure as the CD encryption that came out a while ago, which was easily bypassed by holding down the left   key while the CD was spinning up. Oopsie. Stick to programming Mars probes, guys.  I always laugh at these poeple, the CRIA here in Canada, and the RIAA and MPAA in the U.S. Claiming that their sales have gone down since Napster and the like, they have been on a crusade to stop us from downloading that which should be free anyway. Yet I haven't noticed movies taking a hit. How many millions did  Lord of the Ring  make this year? And just because I downloaded  Return of the King  and have it in DVD-quality format doesn't mean I'm not going to drop the outrageous 26$ to buy it when it comes out in  urlLink May  .   And then there are CD sales. Don't even get me started on those! They have only increased since the file sharing revolution began!   I'm getting twitchy...I need to go home. I'll finish this later.

       Well, I've been asked this a few times from friends, so I've decided to post it up. This last Sunday was awsome. Incredible. Fantastic. Rose and I went to see  urlLink  The Crystal Method  . Holy crap, I have never felt bass like that in the whole of my life.  The show was gratefully paid for by  urlLink DJ Freq , my best friend, Aaron Foley. For this, I feel that I am forever in his debt.    It was all supposed to begin at 8 P.M. so Rose and I decide to be fashionable late and arive a little after 8. That gave us some time to watch the Academy Awards and get ready, at our own pace. By the time we got there, it looked like 2,500 other people had similar thoughts, becuase the line up was almost 2 blocks long. So we're waiting, talking, when someone lights up and starts puffing away. Unable to resist the urge, I yell out, in my best Ralph Wiggum voice "It smells like the art teachers office!" which gets a big laugh from the crowd, and elevates me from unknown to, well, no longer unknown. But I digress.  DJ Hyper was the opening act. He was good. Freak, he was incredible. By the time  The Crystal Method  came on, we were ready to rip the palce apart with our bare hands. Then "Legion of Boom!" starts, and all of a sudden I'm like "Oh me oh my, I seem to have transcended into another level of existence". It was fantastic. From about 12:30 'till 2:00 AM, which passed like a bat of the eye, Rose and I were one body moving in synch, broken only by the urge to feed our beer and gin-and-tonic cravings. I find that G&T's are quite nice for the right mind-set while at a  Crystal Method  event.  We went home and were in stunned silence. I, for one, couldn't believe that I had been there.   Thank you Aaron. Thank you Mev! We both miss and love you two!  CYODFS.

       Well, thanks to Droo, the local resident physics guru in these here parts, here's a description of how the Gravity Prode works:  "Gravity probe B, if it works, will be the first actual measurement of the folding of space-time.  Perhaps the best way of picturing spacetime is to picture a large, flat pan full of water.  Now, imagine you drop a pingpong ball in that water.  If the water is undisturbed, its surface is perfectly flat.  Now, if you drop a pingpong ball in it, you create ripples in the surface of this pan of water.  Simple enough, right?  According to Einstein, any mass hanging in space creates curvatures or ripples in the fabric of space itself, just like our pingpong ball in the pan of water.  A gyroscope uses a pretty simple principle (the frisbee works of the gyroscopic principle) that if you have a mass spinning, it will stay oriented in the same direction in space.  So, what if you change the direction *space* is oriented?  Well, the direction our Gyroscopes are oriented will change with it.  So what Nasa's done is create four of the most precise gyroscopes ever created.  It's estimated that they will be off by less than 1% every thousand years.  As the sattellite orbits around the earth, it will be able to directly measure how much spacetime curves around the earth, and it will also be able to measure something called "frame dragging."  If we return to our pingpong ball for a second, if you now drag this pingpong ball through straight through the water, you'll see ripples that form sort of a V-shape behind the ball (assuming you pull it at a constant speed).  Space time is pretty much the same way.  When the Earth flies through space, or spins on its axis it creates ripples on the surface of spacetime which radiate outwards from its center of mass.  Basically, the earth drags spacetime around with it.  By, in essence, placing a tiny boat bobbing on the surface of our pan of water, we can directly measure the curvature of spacetime, study how the earth drags it around."  Thanks Droo. Considering how I asked him to describe the function of the probe to me as though he was talking to a child, I think he did a very good job. Pat yourself on the back!  CYODFS

       Hi everyone. Sorry it's been so long, but the internet here at the office has been a little funky, so I haven't beena ble to post as much as I would like.  A few things worth blogging about happened...wait a sec.."worth blogging about"? Isn't everything and anything "worth blogging about"? Isn't that the point of a blog, is that its a forum where the author can express whatever views he/she feels are important and deserve mention? The nature of a blog is that of "this is me expressing myself" and it's open to whoever would like to read it.  On that note...a few things I feel like tlaking about. This week, NASA launched a probe to effectively decide wether or not Einstein's theory of relativity will hold up. It will measure frame shifting or somethign like that. To be honest I don't quite understand it, but it will measure wether or not the mas sof the Earth affects time it takes up. Or something like that. I am almost certain I'm horribly mangling this, so if anyone can explain what the Probe will really do, please e-mail me and tell me.  Second event of note: I have an appointement will human resources. I'm going to talk to them about my future at the company. If I want to have one. I've also been talking to some of the supervisors on my floor, gently probing as to any openings that they know of. I know of 1 that I could go for, but I don't really want it, so I'm not going for it.  More later, 'casue right now it's quittin' time.  CYODFS.

That last post was just too depressing for me, and for a few other people too. I had actually received comments about it, so I removed it. That's what you can do as an Administrator. You can add, and you can Remove. I like being the Admin. All I need is my own server, and I'll be my own sys_admin. In the words of our glorious provincial founders, 'Yee-Haw'.

       Rose says:   Geez! The whole neighborhood was partying last night... the Calgary Flames beat the Vancouver Canucks 4-0... and they did it all without severely beating any of the opposing players... *snif*... I'm so proud!   True story: Monday it was so warm I was wearing shorts. Fast foreword to Wednesday, and we've gotten 3" of snow overnight. hmm... I'm starting to suspect that Lex Luthor lives in Calgary and is perfecting that weather control device of his. Think I'll go build a snowman on the balcony so I can watch him melt tomorrow when it's +20 again.

       Hey I've just been invited to start writing for this wonderful blog. Does this mean I get to listed as a contributor !  I want to write something here but the pressure of the whole situation is too much....Maybe later..... but thanks for the invite mike.  I would invite you to write on my blog but then I think the whole thing would become a little redundant.   heheh   does it strike anyone else as strange that the word "Blog" isn't in the default dictionary for the blogger spellcheck.

       That's the stuff, Mike... picking on innocent children! Be careful.... have you ever heard of such a thing as Karma?   Rose got a promotion! Lalalala!! I'm excited. No more of this sitting at home frustrated because they haven't called me (like I have been all week). Starting on the 19th, I'll actually have scheduled hours.   To Celebrate, Mike and I are going to go see the Dinosaurs this weekend... ROWR! We're going to Drumheller, a few hours north of here, which has the richest deposit of Dinosaur fossils in the world. Should be interesting.   Last Saturday we went to see the Bog People at the Glenbow Museum. It was very interesting, but very morbid. They're the mummified people they found in the European Peat Bogs. Very Cool.

       Right, I can't believe that I forgot to write about this.  As many of you might know, I've taken to spending most of my lunch time in the gym at Shell. Today, near the end, something funny happened. Actually, I'd consider it more Gi (GoodInteresting) rather than funny, but suffice it to say that I was laughing so hard I needed to use the emergency stop on the treadmill.  As I was running, not very fast, but not walking, either, this girl who is walking in the corridor opposite me starts making faces at me. I'm not talking some 20-something, I'm talking more like 6. She was making the stereotypical 'ugly' faces that kids like to make. SO, me being me, I started making faces right back at her. Well, this went on for a couple of minutes, when she decided/was told that it was time to leave. So she turned around and walked right into a support post for the corridor. She didn't walk into it, she assaulted it. She hit it so hard that she literally bounced back.   She then made her most fatal mistake: she turned to look at me. She had a welt the size of a tangerine and growing on her forehead like the Germans occupying France. I just couldn't help myself: I started to laugh. You know the kind of laugh: when you can't breath and it hurts so hard you think you're gonna puke. This poor girl had nearly concussed herself in a 3-Stooge-Esque feat of embarrassment, and all I could do was laugh.   I grabbed the handhold on the treadmill, and hit the emergency stop button at the same time so I could laugh more. She saw me do this, and promptly turned a very deep shade of red. A councilor or some other person of authority came over and help her away. I swear to the  urlLink Almighty  that this poor 6 year old was wobbling and weaving this way and that as she was lead away. At least I think she was...I was laughing just too damn hard.  Is this really my life?  CYODFS.

The second one is for the most powerful browser I've ever seen, called  urlLink Opera .   Both of these are very well put together browsers that offer much more flexibility than, and are a perfectly good, safe, and secure, in in most cases more friendly, altenative to Microsoft's bug-ridden, swiss-cheesed Internet Explorer.   I urge anyone wanting to explore a better way of navigating to try either of these. They both have their ups and downs, but these are very easily forgotten once they're used for about half an hour.  Try it out.  CYODFS

       Just a little something I saw on NYTimes's website:  A Heretical View of File Sharing By JOHN SCHWARTZ   The music industry says it repeatedly, with passion and conviction: downloading hurts sales.   That statement is at the heart of the war on file sharing, both of music and movies, and underpins lawsuits against thousands of music fans, as well as legislation approved last week by a House Judiciary subcommittee that would create federal penalties for using what is known as peer-to-peer technology to download copyrighted works. It is also part of the reason that the Justice Department introduced an intellectual-property task force last week that plans to step up criminal prosecutions of copyright infringers.   But what if the industry is wrong, and file sharing is not hurting record sales?  It might seem counterintuitive, but that is the conclusion reached by two economists who released a draft last week of the first study that makes a rigorous economic comparison of directly observed activity on file-sharing networks and music buying.   " Downloads have an effect on sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero , despite rather precise estimates," write its authors, Felix Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business School and Koleman S. Strumpf of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.    The industry has reacted with the kind of flustered consternation that the White House might display if Richard A. Clarke showed up at a Rose Garden tea party. Last week, the Recording Industry Association of America sent out three versions of a six-page response to the study.  The problem with the industry view, Professors Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf say, is that it is not supported by solid evidence. Previous studies have failed because they tend to depend on surveys, and the authors contend that surveys of illegal activity are not trustworthy. "Those who agree to have their Internet behavior discussed or monitored are unlikely to be representative of all Internet users," the authors wrote.  Instead, they analyzed the direct data of music downloaders over a 17-week period in the fall of 2002, and compared that activity with actual music purchases during that time. Using complex mathematical formulas, they determined that spikes in downloading had almost no discernible effect on sales. Even under their worst-case example, "it would take 5,000 downloads to reduce the sales of an album by one copy," they wrote. "After annualizing, this would imply a yearly sales loss of two million albums, which is virtually rounding error" given that 803 million records were sold in 2002. Sales dropped by 139 million albums from 2000 to 2002.  "While downloads occur on a vast scale, most users are likely individuals who would not have bought the album even in the absence of file sharing," the professors wrote.  In an interview, Professor Oberholzer-Gee said that previous research assumed that every download could be thought of as a lost sale. In fact, he said, most downloaders were drawn to free music and were unlikely to spend $18 on a CD.   "Say I offer you a free flight to Florida," he asks. "How likely is it that you will go to Florida? It is very likely, because the price is free." If there were no free ticket, that trip to Florida would be much less likely, he said. Similarly, free music might draw all kinds of people, but "it doesn't mean that these people would buy CD's at $18," he said.  The most popular albums bought are also the most popular downloads, so the researchers looked for anomalous rises in downloading activity that they might compare to sales activity. They found one such spike, Professor Oberholzer-Gee said, during a German school holiday that occurred during the time they studied. Germany is second to the United States in making files available for downloading, supplying about 15 percent of online music files, he said. During the vacation, students who were home with time on their hands flooded the Internet with new files, which in turn spurred new downloading activity. The researchers then looked for any possible impact in the subsequent weeks on sales of CD's.   Professor Oberholzer said that he had expected to find that downloading resulted in some harm to the industry, and was startled when he first ran the numbers in the spring of 2003. "I called Koleman and said, 'Something is not quite right - there seems to be no effect between file sharing and sales.' "   Amy Weiss, an industry spokeswoman, expressed incredulity at what she deemed an "incomprehensible" study, and she ridiculed the notion that a relatively small sample of downloads could shed light on the universe of activity.   The industry response, titled "Downloading Hurts Sales," concludes: "If file sharing has no negative impact on the purchasing patterns of the top selling records, how do you account for the fact that, according to SoundScan, the decrease of Top 10 selling albums in each of the last four years is: 2000, 60 million units; 2001, 40 million units; 2002, 34 million units; 2003, 33 million units?"  Critics of the industry's stance have long suggested that other factors might be contributing to the drop in sales, including a slow economy, fewer new releases and a consolidation of radio networks that has resulted in less variety on the airwaves. Some market experts have also suggested that record sales in the 1990's might have been abnormally high as people bought CD's to replace their vinyl record collections.  "The single-bullet theory employed by the R.I.A.A. has always been considered by anyone with even a modicum of economic knowledge to be pretty ambitious as spin," said Joe Fleischer, the head of sales and marketing for BigChampagne, a company that tracks music downloads and is used by some record companies to measure the popularity of songs for marketing purposes.   The industry response stresses that the new study has not gone through the process of peer review. But the response cites refuting statistics and analysis, much of it prepared by market research consultants, that also have not gone through peer review.  One consultant, Russ Crupnick, vice president of the NPD Group, called the report "absolutely astounding." Asked to explain how the professors' analysis might be mistaken, he said he was still trying to understand the complex document: "I am not the level of mathematician that the professors purport to be."  Stan Liebowitz of the University of Texas at Dallas, author of an essay cited by the industry, said the use of a German holiday to judge American behavior was strained. Professor Liebowitz argued in a paper in 2002 that file sharing did not affect music sales, but said he had since changed his mind.   The Liebowitz essay appeared in an economics journal edited by Gary D. Libecap, a professor of economics at the University of Arizona, who said that his publication was not peer reviewed, though the articles in it were often based on peer-reviewed work. Professor Libecap said he attended a presentation by Professor Strumpf last week, and said the file-sharing study "looks really good to me."  "This was really careful, empirical work," Professor Libecap said.  The author of another report recommended by the industry said that the two sets of data used by the researchers should not be compared. "They can't get to that using the two sets of data they are using - they aren't tracking individual behavior," said Jayne Charneski, formerly of Edison Media Research, who prepared a report last June that she said showed that 7 percent of the marketplace consists of people who download music and do not buy it. That number is far lower than the authors of the new study estimated. "There's a lot of research out there that's conducted with an agenda in mind," said Ms. Charneski, now the head of research for the record label EMI.

       Ah, longing for the 'salad days' (thanks Foley) of old. For the last 8 months or so I've been working at Shell Canada. It's been fun, and it's sucked, so I guess it's about half and half. Foley, Adam and I have been e-mailing each other, and that has made me really, really miss Lennoxville.   The Lion. Greq. The way the town smelled like the insode of a hampster cage when the paper mill was...doing whatever it does to make the town smell that way. Don't ask me what it is, I don't know. But nonetheless, I'm missing it. There are just some things that happen better in Lennoxville. Walking home, from anywhere, is a LOT better in Lennoxville. There was just something about how something interesting would always happen. But it would be a good interesting, like seeing that 2 of your frineds have hooked up after being madly in love witheach other for the longest time.   In Calgary, something interesting will invariably happen, but it's not the good kind of interesting. No matter what drivel Seaseme Street peddles to the open young minds, not all things that are interesting are also good. One can very easily distinguish between good-interesting (hereafter Gi) and bad-interesting (hereafter Bi). Friends hooking up = Gi. Crazy, homeless guitar player talking to his guitar case, then opening it up and going crazy 'cause said guitar isn't in there = Bi. In fact, that ='s ++Bi. Take a wild freakin' guess which one happened to Mike yesterday?  Yup, Mike saw a definate case of Bi. This guy was insane, and not to mention smelly. He stank, not like booze or Scope®  but rather like onions. There is nothing worse than a well-fed homeless guy talking to his guitar case. Did I mention that he was wearing sweat pants in public?   I want to leave Calgary becasue of moments like these. Yet, it's also like driving past a train wreck: you have to see just as much as you can. It's like everyday I try to see something that will top the previous day's Bi, or, if Karma is really good, something that's Gi.   Don't get me wrong, there is lots of Gi that is happening. In fact, everytime I see a kid and make faces at them, that's Gi because every kid reacts differently. The other day on the train home there was a little girl, about 1, who would 'wake up', make a face, then 'go to sleep'. I can only assume that she figured that if she couldn't see me I couldn't see her. Hilarious. It amused me for the whole ride home.  It just feels that, more often than not, it's something Bi that happens, and it feels like just the tinyest piece of me dies screaming. I guess that's what we get for moving from a small, wonderfully beautiful town to hick- redneck muder- rape-prone Calgary where the bums are so rich they smell of food and own guitar (cases).   Lennoxville, I miss you so!  CYODFS

             Yarg. I found out recently why we've been having such problems with out Net access here at the office. It's because, before we "improved" our infrastructure, we were using internal servers that we connecting to the Net from this building. Now, since we've "upgraded", our access is going through Zanzibar or whatever other far-flung island in the mid-Pacific we're wired to. But now there are at least a half-dozen firewalls between me and  urlLink Gmail . Which, needless to say, sucks.      This was, to use a drastically inappropriate term, a busy weekend. Let us begin at the beginning.       Friday Rose and I went to  Buddha's Veggie Delight  with our friends Chris and Tara, and Linda along for company.       &nbsp;This was a truly amazing place: ginger beef, sweet and sour pork, crustaceans galore...and none of it real. Fake ginger beef. Fake sweet and sour pork. Fake crustaceans. Everything was made of tasty, and health, soy/tofu variants. And it was the best I've ever had. The ginger beef was nice and crispy. The sweet and sour pork had just the right texture. I don't eat crustaceans, but I hear they were very well done.       The rest of the night was spent in relative relaxation at home watching    Underworld    (there's some bandwidth I could have put to better use) and crawling into bed around midnight.      Saturday Rose had to work so I took full advantage of all this free time on my hands. And slept. Hey, I deserved it. That night we went to Batri's where we cheered on our Flames as they smitted the pesky Tampa Bay Lightning. We won 3-0 and things were good. Then we all watched    ,  urlLink Shaolin Soccer    . Oh my Lord was this the greatest movie ever made? I think so. That night will be remembered as the founding of the "Evil Team", consisting of Brothers Droo, Batri, Eugene, and myself, and sisters Rose, April, and Janna. We're getting t-shirts made this week. If you ever get the chance, rent this movie. It's awesome!      And yesterday, Sunday, we were deprived of our sleeping-in so that we could go and get Foley in Edmonton. This was a very, very fun day. We went to the Elephant and Castle in Edmonton, hit up the West Edmonton mall, learned about the G-Spot thanks to a book called    Quivering Like Jell-O   . Things were, therefore, pretty much normal for the three of us. Except that we missed Mev a whole lot. But we get to see them again on the 18th! w00t!      I got a new shirt and a funny rubber stamp that reads &quot;CONFIDENTIAL - read this and I will have to kill you&quot; with a pad of red ink. It's really funny.      Well, I've actually got some work to do right now, but I'll post again tomorrow.       CYODFS.

             Well, things really have been interesting this weekend. That's why there haven't been as many posts...'cause we've been busy having fun.      Friday morning:       (CBC Radio)      : And call us in if you have some interesting, but preferably horrible, stories of camping experiences and you could win tickets to see Canada's own Ron James live, in person, at the Banff Centre!       Mike:    I should tell my exploding tree story. (For those of you who are wondering, the story involves a rotten tree stump, a Coleman lantern, fuel for said lantern, and a very stupid little boy.  urlLink G-mail me  for details.)      Later that morning, while I'm at work:        Mike:    Shell Canada, Mike speaking.      Rose:    Hey dood, it's me, they just announced your winning story on the radio! We're going to Banff tonight!      Mike:    Schweit       After that, it was just a matter of getting cleaned up after work, getting out of Calgary and into Banff before 8 PM, and then finding this place. Well, after about 15 minutes of walking around in the freezing rain, we find the theatre, and are treated to some very funny comedy, thanks to the CBC and Ron James. But, just before we went in, my cell phone rang.        Mike:    Hello?      Bob:    Heya Mikey, you and Rosie still helpin' us move our place tomorrow afternoon?      Mike:   ...Yah man, 'course. For sure. See you at 9?      Bob:    Sounds great man, show up whenever!       So the next day, we helped Bob and San move their home. This was actually kinda fun. I got to ride in the back of a huge cargo van, bent over various household goods like TV shelves and rowing machines. Then we had pizza and beer. Which was a good thing too, since we were hitting Aussie Rules later that evening.      Now, Aussie Rules is what the whole hip world would be doing if they were at Aussie Rules. It's the type of place where they don't only tolerate you dancing on your chair, they actually encourage you to do it. There are two pianos set up, a couple of guys come out and start playing requests. No crappy songs, but good old tunes, like    Piano man    by Billy Joel, and    The Gambler    by Kenny Rogers. By the end of the night we were exhausted, voiceless, and Eva was more drunk than Robert Downy Jr. at an NA meeting. It was fun. Lots of beer induced, Boobie-rific, music filled fun the likes not even Nero could have imagined in his twisted little fiddle-playing mind. Don't ask were that came from, I'm not entirely sure myself.      Anyhoo, Sunday was a day of rest. A day of waking up at noon, eating bad food that tastes great, and of general tomfoolery in the apartment. And grocery shopping. There was one interesting thing that happened Sunday morning.      I'm of the belief that McDonald's breakfasts are the best thing in the world after a long night of drinking and dancing. So when I went to get my #8 breakfast meal, the nice voice on the intercom asked &quot;Is there anything else I can get you?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Come to think of it, a large coke please.&quot; And then, no word of a lie, I hear this come out of that speaker: &quot;I    thought    so!&quot; in the most, and I don't want to offend with this, homosexual voice I have ever heard. I was in stitches all morning over that.       Monday, being Victoria Day, was another day that I could sleep in, so I took full advantage of it. Then we went and saw some turtles of the botanical gardens, and in the evening Bob and San came over for veggie lasagna and garlic bread, then an episode of    Enterprise   .      All in all, it was pretty much one of the most amusing weekends I've had in a long time, a large part of it was due to the company that helped us do it. You know who you are!

             Today has definitely been one of those days. In case anyone missed it, there was a system failure yesterday in our wonderfully glorious sales system. This meant that we could not do our jobs. We sat around talking, which was great, until I got home and had a drink. Then it hit me, as I was downloading the latest  Enterprise  episode at blazingly fast speed, that we would have to catch up today.      Now, this doesn't sound like much. And most people will probably work a lot harder in a day than I do in a week, because let's face it, I'm&nbsp; a lube jockey. I sit on my butt and enter the same orders in the system all day. It's not the most challenging job, but there are parts of it that are fun, like talking to the chief engineer of a Portuguese freighter and trying to explain to him why we can't take back expired product from another company (it was Esso) that came from another country and expired a year ago. Things like that are fun. But on the whole, the job is talking to Dan from Flin Flon, Manitoba, asking him how it's going, talking about the weather, and selling him a few thousand kilos of oil. So, all in all, boring.       Except when things go wrong. When they go wrong, things grind to a stop like an engine without oil. Nice example innit? Anyway, I came in an hour early today and everything has just been horribly hectic ever since. I don't think that I stopped until lunch at 1.30 PM. Needless to say that this long day, coupled with the Flames victory last night, has made for a very, very long day. I'm planning on going home, opening a cold one, putting on something nice and moody, like    Serpico   , and drifting into dreams of the sugar-plum variety.      CYODFS

             OK, this is pretty much verbatin what happened about 30 minutes ago between me and the help desk here at Shell:       Mike: Waiting on hold.      15 minutes go by      Voice: Help desk, how can I help you?     Mike: Thank God, I thought you had forgotten about me!     Voice: We haven't, how can I help you?     Mike: How long will it take our sales system to be back up? (It has been down since 9.30)     Voice: We don't know yet, sorry.     Mike: Any idea what the problem is?     Voice: Nope.      Mike loses all hope of a calm afternoon at this point        Oh well, I guess I can't really complain. Traditionally Thursdays are slower. so catching up won't be too difficult. I hope. Maybe I can put in some overtime to get extra work done.      CYODFS

       Well, here's where I stand right now. Since our main sales / order entry system isn't working right now (it's been down for about two hours) I've decided to give a quick post. Maybe it'll be something that I can send in to the E.F.F.  I am now a card carrying member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. That's a big for me. I've long felt very strongly, as you might have noticed by my past posts here and on the group blog (Bursting the Bubble) about the free-speech and privacy issues facing everyday computer users. The E.F.F. is an organization that is fighting for our rights online. They are an organization that is trying to raise awareness of violations of personal privacy by large mega-corps and the US government. The other day I sent in a 15$ contribution to them, and as such I can now proudly call myself a member.  Work has been hectic. We've been short-staffed the last few days so by the end of the day I'm a little exhausted. I hope that I haven't been to short-tempered with anyone. My stress levels arn't that high, but that's only because I'm working out at lunch time, which I was neglecting for a couple of weeks. Even that short a time made getting back into the groove very difficult. I see it as a matter or motivation. I just don't feel like going, but as soon as I'm there it's great fun. It's important to bring reading material; nothing is worse that reading 2 month old back-issues of "Maclean's" while on the elliptical or the bike.  Sadly, that is all there is to report regarding my life at present. I'll post more in a little while.  CYODFS.

       Rose says:  So, Mike changed the blog again... hmm... puke green doesn't necessarily excite me, but to each his own!   I figured that picture was a call to say something.  I have to admit it, I have an addiction. A Tetris addiction. That game is the devil! And I'm not even very good at it! I wonder if there's a support group out there.   I'm also scared. In a recent post, as you can see, Mike refers to us as Calgarians. Gak! When did that happen? It ruins my whole plan to have as little as possible in common with Ralph Klein. Man, what a doofus. I won't even get into it.   Work's going ok, but as a result of my new position, I now get to deal with every irate asshole in the south west of the city (I know some of you sympathize). Seriously, though... how upset and abusive can one person get over a $1.50 debt? Just stop by the library sometime and see firsthand.   I got some really sad news this week. A friend of mine who I used to work with, a really talented journalist named Gordon Legge's body was found after he'd been missing in Banff since February. I know everybody says so about the recently departed, but he really was the nicest man I've ever met. He was also deeply spiritual, and his death is inspiring me to reexamine my own spirituality, which has been sadly neglected.   Anyhoo, that's all the news that's fit to write,   TTFN, Rose

       Guess what I'm doing right now? Really wishing that I wasn't at work and really wondering where all my money went. I got paid Wednesday, and already my bank account is empty. In fact, it's over-drawn 55$.  But in all reality, I'm listening to "115. 205 - Spritney Bears - What A Feeling (Club Mix).mp3 [5:50]" .Isn't that the most awesome DJ name ever? I think so. And the remix...it's classic....dance themes to Flashdance! Why do I need an iPod? So I can listen to songs like this all the time!  I was at London Drugs last night and they had a Mac G5 on display. It was drool-village right there man...all titanium case, grilled on the front, and dual 2.0 GHz's inside, all running Mac OS X.3 (10.3, a.k.a. Panther). By all account, the Velociraptor of desktops. It was as schweit as could be. Then the sales person came by. By all things holy, this was the most out of place computer salesperson I have ever seen, and here's why:  1. They had a tan.  2. They had bathed in the last 24 hours. Probably more than once, judging from the smell of shampoo.  (Now I'm listening to "116. 206 - DJ Howard - Theme From Sjølyst (Voodoo Beats Remix).mp3 [6:18]"  3. They were articulate, respectful to my near-total ignorance of all things Mac, and confidant (seeming) about their knowledge of said Mac.  4. "They" was a chick.   5. She was kinda cute.  All of this really, really surprised me. In fact, I had to catch myself from ordering one just because I was caught unprepared for having to deal with a she-Geek.  (Currently spinning "117. 207 - Systems F feat. Armin Van Burren - Exhale.mp3 [7:07]")  But then I began to wonder why I was so confused about a girl computer sales person, and the sad truth is that I couldn't think of a single reason. I'm somewhat ashamed at myself.  Introspection is good, isn't it?  CYODFS

             And all the King's men can't put Paul Martin together again.        The Liberals have used their majority government to stop all hearing on the sponsorship scandal, only a few days after the two biggest frauds in Canadian history have been arrested by the RCMP.      How obvious is it that Martin just wants this to go away, thinking that we will forget all about the scandal? It's also very, very sad. Martin was given control of one of the greatest countries on Earth, and he is desperate to hold on to the power. Historically, those who most desire to rule should never be permitted to do so. In fact, we should find the person who least wants the Prime Ministerial power and give to them. Politicians should make politics. But we need a true leader to lead.       What we need is another Trudeau. Harper's a dweeb and McKay is a back-stabber. I'm not following either of them. What are we left with? I'm not really sure, but it's pretty pathetic looking.

       There is a great initiative going on with the folks at  urlLink The Command Post  . They are attempting to raise $10,000 USD for the education of a family that is most composed of adopted children. It began as part of a wake up call that there is too much violence, hatred, anger and fear in our world and not enough love, compassion, generosity and caring for our fellow human beings.   I strongly urge everyone to go there and donate money. 10,000 USD in 3 days is their goal, and I don't think that a college fund for children who wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to attend University can be viewed, by anyone, as a waste of money.  Please, donate what you can.    urlLink Here  is the original link. The donation forum is found at the bottom. Read the story, as well.  CYODFS

       This is getting seriously out of hand. For those of you who do not know Calgary, we Calgarians have an exprssion: If you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes. Well, I've been waiting. I've waited five minutes. I've waited ten minutes. Technically, I've waited 3,600 minutes. And it's still snowing.  Snow snow snow...is that all it does around here? Now, I'm very well aware of the stigma against using the weather as the subject of a conversation, and especially against the usage of the weather to help me post, but this is getting out of hand.  Nothing can really convince me that it won't snow anymore...especially not after seeing the pictures from last year, when it snowed something like 25-30 cms overnight Sunday. Argh.  But something funny did just happen to me just this very second. I ran to the local corner store for some much-needed dinner accessories: hot-dog buns, hot-dog wieners, and relish. Now, we're really well known at this particular store, and at this time, there is the most charming lady working there. When she sees what I want to buy, and looks up at me. Here's how the conversation went:  Her: Lemme guess: you want hot-dogs for dinner, but alls you got is the ketchup and mustard, right? Mike: Yes, ma'am. Her: I know you really well, don't I? Mike: Yes, ma'am  Now, I realize that this doesn't sound as funny as it did then, but that's probably because that she has the slightest Thai accent that just doesn't come across in text.  Anyway, I smell hot-dog boiling, so I'll sing off here.  CYODFS.

       Originally posted Feb. 26, 2004, this is the first submission I'm using:  "So, I've been told that since this story is so funny I need to include it on the blog.  There is a store in Calgary called Ribtors. It sells pretty much everything you could possibly need that's not food. Camping supplies, hardware, everything. Sadly, it's close to the dis-reputable end of town, where the "Ladies of the Night" gather. That's right folks, this one deals with prostitutes.  So I'm driving around like a chicken with no head, trying to find this store. I drive across an intersection and I see it off to my left. I look ahead and find myself in a cul-de-sac, with a working-girl coming my way. I motion to her what I think is easily interpreted as "No offence to you or your pimp, but I am not currently soliciting the use of a sex-trade worker. But thank you for you interest and all the best to you."   Now, I can only assume that she interpreted this as "Go away you pathetic specimen of humanity, I am far superior than you are and I pity you." Which is exactly what I did *not* want to convey, because I don't like offending anyone, and especially not prostitutes. I say this because after my word-less statement of "Thank you very much but no thank you" she flipped me off. With both hands, and a very visible  F-U-C-K Y-O-U. For those of you know follow the WWE, think of Stone Cold Steve Austin giving someone the double kick-stands before beating the snot out of them. And then she started coming towards my new, shiny, very nice car. The same car that I very much did not want damaged.   So I slammed my foot in the gas and peeled away like a Nascar racer on the inbound 273rd lap. Right across the street, into a parking lot.  Where I stayed for almost 15 minutes, as the prostitute paced around. I can only assume that I had crossed some kind of territorial line, because she didn't come after me. Thankfully. Her nails could have ripped the paint right off the car, I'm sure.  So this is my story. I hope you have enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed telling it, and let me close off by saying that whatever you do, please, don't make hand signals to hookers. It's just not worth it."

             It looks like the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation -  http://www.eff.org ) is looking for a writing intern. How much do I want to do this? Very much. What do I have to submit as proof of my amazing writing skills? Nothing. Well, except maybe some humorous stories from here. Like maybe the one about the hooker. Yeah, that'll do.&nbsp; But I need at least three to four proofs of writing skill and ability in order to apply. But I am somewhat biased, and since we're being frank here, I'm not exactly my own greatest judge. But I'm convinced that there must be at least three posts that are worthy of submission somewhere on my blog.      So it's up to you. Select from the archives you 3 favorite posts, and I will use them, in conjunction with the Hooker Epic, as submission material to apply for the Internship at the EFF.

       It's about time. For those of you who haven't been exposed to the Quebec bureaucracy, it's horrible. During the last election, I needed to register to vote. It literally took 4 people to do it:    Over paid PQ Party Member who has a job 'cause the PQ got in on the 'We'll give you jobs' vote 1  asked the questions.   Over paid PQ Party Member who has a job 'cause the PQ got in on the 'We'll give you jobs' vote  2  wrote down the answers.   Over paid PQ Party Member who has a job 'cause the PQ got in on the 'We'll give you jobs' vote 3  verified my ID to make sure I wasn't scamming or double registering or whatever.   Over paid PQ Party Member who has a job 'cause the PQ got in on the 'We'll give you jobs' vote 4  read the newspaper.  That's why I'm really  happy to finally see stories like  urlLink this  . At last, someone is putting my (albeit former) tax dollars to better use than funding Only-French-speaking-"I ate da Hengliish"-bureaucrats.  Way to go Jean Charest.

       Maybe this title should have been "Need...To...Sleep!" because we have been just so busy for the last few days, Rose and I have been ridiculously busy!  Friday night we wanted to go see "Fahrenheit 9/11". Apparently a few thousand other people had the same idea because the theatre was completely sold out! Bot of them! So we ended up seeing "Troy" instead. All in all not a horrible movie, but it was *WAY* too long and if I see Brad Pitt do one more of those jump attacks, like some kinda of oiled up Mega Man I swear to the Almighty that I will go crazy. Who leaves their feet in a sword-and-spear fight? But other than that, I found it to be just historically accurate enough to resemble the original story (IE all the people and places had the right names and the general idea of warfare was conveyed) that things were fun, and yet inventive enough that things were interesting.  But it's pretty obvious how the producers left it open for "The Odyssey" to be filmed in a few years.  After the movie we went to "The Watchman's" for a few drinks. We missed Chris and Tara and Aaron and Mev. He finally  urlLink proposed , good for him! Apparently, as he described the event, it was a tear-filled weep fest, so that's good...'cause she said YES!  During Saturday we didn't do that much really. Rose worked so I stayed at home, getting the placed all cleaned and ready for people to come over...when no one did. Which, in retrospect, was kinda nice since we were tired. So once again we hit up "The Watchman's" and had a great time. Got home late, went to bed later! Rock on!  Sunday was lazy and relaxed, with Rose going to church and me sleeping. Safeway was involved in the breakfast-making effort, and movies were watched. The original "Gone in 60 Seconds" was funny. It was really about the car, so the 45-minute long car chase really makes you feel good inside when he gets away.  Remember the afore-mentioned Chris and Tara? They showed up Sunday night and are crashing at our place 'till Wednesday. They're in the middle of a move, and they needed to grab some stuff from Chris' dad's place, so things are fun that way. We have house guests once more, and maybe this time Chris can teach me all kinda of nefarious tricks and tips for me to use on my computer.....mwahahahahahahaha!  That's about it really, other than my lunch time exploits, trying to keep my tastee falafel out of the hands of the evil goose-people. Man, those brain-damaged geese really know how to beg!

             Wow.        This weekend was so much fun that it's hard to remember it all. Everything started on Thursday evening when Rose and I helped Chris and Tara move their apartment into a 14' U-Haul truck. Let's suffice it to say that they have a *LOT* of stuff. I think we helped them move for 4 hours and we moved maybe 3 rooms worth of stuff. But it was fun and we got free beer and free pizza, so I'm happy. But I'm sad to see them leaving us, even if it is just to Edmonton. But hey, as Batri said...ROAD TRIP!!!      Friday I was kept busy all morning preparing for the arrival of Aaron and Mev. They showed up around noon, so then we took the rental back and had some lunch, all while I was enjoying my day off. Bumped into Josh and Bernard from the office on the way back and gloated about not having to work. It feels nice to be an ass! Later Friday night we had food (my famous Dal) and went to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  on the IMAX screen. Holy crap I'm never seeing a movie on a non-IMAX screen again! This was, by far, the best way to see any movie ever. Especially H.P.3!      Saturday was spent in Canmore, walking in the sun and seeing some beautiful mountains. We lunched at the Grizzly Paw Pub, which was really nice. They have a great veggie burger, which both Aaron and Rose got. And they put beats in their ruffage salad, which I think is a very unique touch. That night we went to Bob and San's place and had a huge bar-be-que/bon fire. See, Bob's got this portable fire pit which you can use to have a real bonfire in your backyard without having a fire hazard warning from the local FD. Really got it going, too! To the point where the wooden handle on the top of it was glowing red and ready to burst into flames itself. We stayed up too late and drank too much, so things were really fun! I think Sunday morning made up for it.      I've realized that there is only one thing worse than shopping drunk, and that's shopping in a strip mall hung-over to high heaven. Late brunch, huge meal and extra coffee notwithstanding, I was feeling like crap about 20 minutes into    Winners   . But we managed to go for about 4 hours, then we crashed. Rose and I slept, Aaron and Mev went for a walk...somewhere, I really couldn't remember where. Then we had dinner at    Mt Everest's Kitchen    followed by a very nice walk down 17th. Then we returned home and watched    Girl with a Pearl Earring    which was awesome.      So needless to say, I was kinda tired this morning. I'm very much looking forward to some    Firefly    and some sleeping.       CYODFS

       Rose and I had a very fun weekend this week. It all started on Friday  night when Chris and Tara came over for dinner. We talked about their  moving to Edmonton, and we're really going to miss them. We also talked  about Chris's server, so that's going to be really, really fun to watch!  So we're going to miss them, but we can also have the occasional excuse  to rent a convertible and drive up to Edmonton to visit them. Waa Hoo!  We watched the movie "Calendar Girls" which is absolutely hilarious.  A bunch of old ladies posing nude for a, you guessed it, calendar for a  fund raiser. Great flick if you are looking for one! Saturday was pretty much copa cetic for us: Rose working and me doing  the tasks at home that I do when Rose works: laundry, dishes, computer  games, and naps. I took a really, really good nap! We are kinda short on  cash right now so we stayed home Saturday night with each other, which  was so much fun that I hope to do it again next weekend! We watched a  few movies, but basically just took things really easy. It was tons of fun!  Then we got busy on Sunday. It started with Church, which we had been  sadly neglecting. Afterwards, we had planned to head off to Spruce  Meadows for a Shell bar-be-que and events like that, but St. Stephens  was having a new comers pot luck, so we decided to go there instead. We  met a host of interesting people from, believe it or not, all across  Canada, and we shared stories, chatted with the rector, and just  generally got to know people. When we arrived we got name tags, and they  had given Rose my last name. It was the first time that it happened, and  I was curious to see how long it was going to stay that way. It lasted  for about an hour, which is a fine starting point I think. Afterwards,  on our way to watch the equestrian events, I asked Rose how it felt, and  we agreed that it would be up to her if she wanted to keep her name or  use mine, Hopefully I'll have an answer for you sometime soon. :P  One really interesting thing about the pot luck was that there was a  gentleman there named Peter, from New York. When I asked the small-talk  question "So, where are you from?" he made a face and responded "That's  a bit of an odd question, really..." Well, it turns out he's one of  those guys who have been everywhere and done a lot. MIT, Boeing in  Seattle, London, Ireland, and I'm 90% certain he was gay. Which doesn't  bother me in the least, but it was the fact that he was hitting on me in  a Church basement. That I found kinda weird. And no priest jokes here,  ok? It's not funny what some people do.  CYODFS

        urlLink Sad, sad times for everyone.    This is something that really affected me, not just a sad piece of news. I remember Reagan. Granted, not very well, but the man is not completely unknown to me. I can still hear his voice. Now I realize that as a Canadian, this might not be the most worth while of opinions, but he was such a pivotal person in the history of North America, especially in the last 30 years, that it's hard to imagine him not being there. In Québec, we used to refer to him as "Notre oncle Régean". Granted, it wasn't always in such a nice way, but that doesn't mean anything. We had a nickname for him. I don't know of any nickname we had for George Bush Sr or Bill Clinton. We liked Reagan, even for an American.  Sigh.  CYODFS

             These last few days have been an economic struggle for me. Rose seems to have handled it with grace, as she does everything, but I've been nervous since the weekend. We had an expensive week last week. Rose went to a dentist last week. Over two-hundred dollars just to have an examination done to determine that she needs work done. Pardon my language, but no shit Batman! That's why we went to the dentist.      So we have that money coming back (hopefully) from her insurance. Some student loans, some bills, and a parking ticket later, and we're maxed. Did I mention that it's rent week?      I don't mean to burden all of you with my financial situation, but it's helping me feel better to get it off my chest.       I will post something a little more upbeat once I get the chance. Our 'Net is down (again) so I will find some news stories once I can.      CYODFS

They're about things that are close to me personally, namely the state of the United States as seen from independent people not associated with George W Bush (since the US is the last superpower on Earth, their political temperature is something that I like to keep a thermometer on, so to speak), and Internet rights and privacy in Canada, seeing how I am a proud believer and firm supporter of the freedom of expression on-line.

Here's a quote:           &nbsp;           Despite this and several other occurrences, Kerry has gone on to secure himself a spot on the ballot in November. Now, the challenge at hand is to get George W. Bush out of office and retired permanently to his beloved ranch in Crawford. In order to accomplish this, Kerry will need absolutely every single vote he can get. The most recent polls (at the time of writing) show that Bush still has strong support in general, and reasonable support for his war on Iraq; if ever there is to be a time that your vote counts, this is it.           &nbsp;            The second site I&#8217;d like to talk about is one that those who are frequent readers might find a little surprising. It&#8217;s the raison d&#8217;être for the  urlLink   CRIA   , the Canadian Recording Industry Association. The Canadian sister-organization to the  urlLink   RIAA   , the  urlLink   CRIA    has released a justification for their recent legal actions against Canadians who upload music. I will have to concede that there are some very valid points they make, but as with any argument used for the purpose of convincing people, there are wild generalizations and assumptions. But decide for yourself.          &nbsp;            urlLink   The Free Music Myth            &nbsp;            Again, here&#8217;s a selection of quoted text:          Question: &quot;THERE ARE NO LEGITIMATE SERVICES OUT THERE FOR ME TO USE, SO I'M FORCED TO FALL BACK ON THE ILLEGITIMATE ONES.&quot;    Answer: A number of legal online services are expected to launch in Canada this fall. Puretracks&#8482;, a Canadian service, has already announced a fall launch date. These sites offer better quality of product and service than illegal alternatives. Many are now offering transfer to portable devices. Potentially, hundreds of thousands of songs will be legally made available at cost-effective prices. And it's just not good enough to say if I can't get it legally, I'll steal it.          &nbsp;           I hope that these sites inform you as they did me, as well as give you a little glimpse into my soul.

             So for the last few weeks I have been following the  Pilades for Dummies  workout video. Pilades, for those of you who don't know, is the Devil's Yoga. Designed for dancers it has as its main tenants &quot;Pulling your navel towards your spine&quot; AKA &quot;Suck in that gut!&quot;. Basically you do these weird movements to improve balance and flexibility all the while keeping your body as tense as a whip-crack.      My favorite exercise is the one called &quot;Rolling Like a Ball&quot;. Sit down, grab behind your knees, suck in that gut!, and roll onto your shoulder blades. Then come up back up. Now this sounds like fun only until it's done after about ten minutes of doing other exercises, so if you're like me, makes you nice and covered in a fine film of sweat. So when you go to roll over, you actually land on your back, slide off the mat, and come to a streaking halt on the hardwood floor, leaving a nice red mark when the floor met your back. Yeah, I love pilades.      Its been too long since I blogged. I miss the feeling. But unfortunately we've been kinda busy recently. There was Stampede, which is like a 10-day long hick fest with tourists dressed in &quot;authentic cowboy gear&quot; that makes Calgarians gag. The shit some people will wear out in public literally reels the mind. So that was fun.      We went hiking Sunday at Nose Hill park, which is this big huge green space right in the middle of Calgary. We picnicked and watch the town. It was fun. Then we got sunburned and went home.      I'll be getting rid of my cell phone. It costs over 50$ a month and all it really does is lets me call home during my breaks from work. I almost never get calls on it, and usually end up placing calls on it, which costs money. So I'm going to see if I can get a really, really cheap plan and see what goes from there. I'm doing this because I really, really want cable during the Olympics. I love watching the Olympics, and we don't want another bill, so this is the way to go for us, really.      I'm outta here. Actually, I'm going to go read some stories. You should too. Here's the website:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  http://www.tuckermax.com       See ya.

        urlLink Southpinellas: Movie drama starts with cell phone, ends with pepper spray   You know, it's about time.   There is a very special circle in Hell reserved for two types of people. People who touch kids, and peple who talk on their cell phone during a play/movie. I mean, what can possibly be so important that it can't wait 2 hours, or if it is important that you stay in touch, put the damn thing on vibrate, and when it rings get out of the theatre. Is that a concept so hard to understand?  What I don't get about this article is why it's even being questionned. I think that pepper spray isn't enough. People who talk on phones at the theatre (traditional or modern) should be beaten, the pepper sprayed, and dragged out into the lobby and have their ticket revoked.   All that technology that is used on the boarder to control immigration and whatnot, the digital face scanning and fingerprinting, I say bring that into the theatre world. Hotels can black-list people for life, movie theatres should use facial recognition to screen people. If you've been ejected from one theatre in the city, then you have to go to another. If you're kicked out of their, then there is something that need checking. This cop should get a medal and a three-week paid vacation for this, not questionned and investigated.

              I have to offer some apologies to any  regular  readers we might have had before I went and stopped posting. You see, I've been really busy lately, what with all that fun-having and general tom-foolery that Rose and I have been having.  First off, the busy stuff. I do a lot of my posting from the  office , and since June we've been running short 1 person every week. I honestly think that since June 1st, we have been 4 for about 2 days. No, a day and a half, actually. So I haven't had that much of a chance to post much, other than the occasional quick point to a funny news story or something that I find interesting.  But now it's Saturday and I can have free reign again!  Wa - hü ! Let's  see , I have applied for a job at  urlLink  WestJet   since I can't stand my current one very much. I had actually applied a few months ago, but nothing much had come up, so I sent in a follow up note to the effect of "What's up?" Here is part of their response:   "I notice that you have not applied for a specific position. In order to be considered, you will need to add a current job opportunity to your application"   Well, unless I misread their website, I didn't have to do that at all. There was even this comment to the effect of "feel free to apply without a job selected" but in their  defense  it was stated that it might not deliver if I sent in an application without a specific job attached to it. So what did I do? I applied for their call  centre  job and haven't heard anything from them since. I really want in, but not if it's at a  pay cut  and to do what I'm doing now at a different company. I'm looking for a change. Oh well, I'll see what comes from it.  Rose is having an absolutely fantastic time at work, although this week she's been hectically-busy so we haven't really done much, except  rent  movies. Bird Dog Video is just a few blocks away and  they  have a great deal: 3 movies for 7 days for 7$. So yeah, we've been taking advantage of that hard-core. This week we rented  Lolita ,  Eating Raoul  (don't ask!) and  Out of Time . That last one stars  Denzel  and isn't that bad. It  definitely  kept me interested in the film, so that's good. Haven't seen the  other  two yet, but get ready for a review as soon as I do.  I'm thinking about getting a DVD burner for  urlLink Prometheus . There is an opportunity for me to get a full copy of Windows XP Pro for under 100$ which is just un-heard of, and since  urlLink Prometheus  is due for a reformat and re-install, then I was thinking of going Pro. Still haven't decided on the DVD (for backing up my 21.7 Gb of music and 81.26 Gb of video files. I heard recently on  urlLink  Gizmodo   that the urlLink  PS3 will be using the  Blu -Ray  DVD standard which will increase storage up to 25Gb on single layer and 50Gb on dual layer. Needless to say, it will mean good times for Mike...if I can find a Blu-Ray burner for under a grand.  I have also started a  webcam  page, so if you would like to indulge your more voyeur- tastic  side,  urlLink then come on in!  There's also a link on the sidebar.  That's about it for now. Check out  urlLink Foley's World  if you want more.  Currently listening to:  Slynus  - Slynus II ( Seb  Fontaine - Prototype Vol 4, Disk 1)
