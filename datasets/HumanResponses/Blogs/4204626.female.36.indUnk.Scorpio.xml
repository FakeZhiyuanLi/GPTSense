       Hello. I just returned from an extended weekend at my parents' place in my hometown. Friday was the 43rd "Corn Daze" celebration at which the local canning factory supplied the event with all the free buttered corn-on-the-cob you could eat. I was a piggy; my total for the day was five ears: three for lunch and two for dinner.       If you've never eaten corn-on-the-cob before, it can be very messy but definitely worth it...  except  when the local news station decides to include footage of your corn-eating piggy self on the 6:00 evening news, which is, unfortunately, exactly what happened to me. And  how is this news?        My sister, her son, his friend, my mother and I were at a picnic table in the park chomping down on our ears when I saw the camera out of the corner of my eye. I thought to myself, " Only  in a small town is something like  this  -- a corn feeding fest -- considered  news . Thankfully, no one watches this station..." But, of course, we had to find out if we did, in fact, make it onto the news. I'm sure those people with the big screen TVs had a good laugh at my expense. ;~{          My sister, Lisa, chomps down while I cover corn-filled teeth.    The TV camera is out of view, but to the right of us.            JW and Andrew show off their tattoos.          Lisa adds her ankle.

       OK, here's my first flaming post...      Time Warner Cable sucks! (Did I already mention this?)      Yesterday, I called to inform them I am disconnecting my internet access on August 27. So, that seems pretty straightforward, right? Moments after I talk to them, my modem stops working; I can't navigate anywhere. After restarting my computer and the modem with no change, I call the TWC helpdesk. The person can't fix it and sets up a service call for today "between the hours of 11:00 and 2:00." (Don't you love that?!!) So, I call back today to get an estimate of when between 11:00 and 2:00 I can expect someone. According to TWC, the service call was cancelled AND my service was disconnected YESTERDAY. Right, yesterday was NOT August 27. Go figure!      OK, OK. I don't want this blog to turn into one of those flamers. So, to make the story short, I spoke to a couple different people at TWC and eventually got my high speed internet back.      ACK! Is it completely obvious I have an addiction to the internet? Oh, and I am drinking a Dr Pepper right now, too...      BTW... Yay for  Wired News  for finally dropping the capital "I" from the word "internet." Long gone are the days when "radio" started with a capital "R."   urlLink  http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64596,00.html

       "Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound"        by Tom Paxton       It's a long and dusty road   It's a hot and heavy load   And the folks I meet ain't always kind   Some are bad and some are good   Some have done the best they could   Some have tried to ease my trouble in mind       Chorus    And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound   Where I'm bound   I can't help but wonder where I'm bound      I've been wandering through this land   Just doin' the best I can   Tryin' to find what I was meant to do   And the people that I see   Look as worried as can be   And it looks like they are wonderin', too       Chorus       And I had me a buddy back home   But he started out to roam   And I hear he's out by Frisco Bay   And, sometimes, when I've had a few   His old voice comes ringin' through   And I'm goin' out to see him some old day      If you see me passin' by   And you sit and you wonder why   And you wish that you were a rambler, too   Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor   Lace 'em up and bar the door   Thank your stars for the roof that's over you      -----      Some people have asked me, "Why are you doing this?"      Why am I leaving my family and friends to venture out into the unknown?      Without becoming too philosophical here (I still have a lot of cleaning I should be doing right now), I believe I've been born cursed or blessed (depending on how you look at it) with a rambling spirit. California will be another adventure on my life's road. I'll keep you posted on how it goes. :-)

            The distance from Minneapolis to Camarillo is around 2,000 miles.      I've spent the past couple of hours mapping out my route West. My earlier plans did not include the Mile High City. My ears can't handle high altitudes. The past couple of times I've driven through Denver have been excruciating for me.       As shown in the map above, my earlier route included nights in Salt Lake City and Las Vegas.   As of right now, I think I'm going to suck up the pain through Denver so I can spend a couple nights in Moab, Utah. I'd like to check out Arches National Park and give my new mountain bike a decent first ride off road.      I'm waiting to hear back from a friend in Lancaster, CA, to see if I can spend a night at her place on my way to Camarillo. Lancaster is only an hour and a half from Camarillo. However, if I do spend some time in Moab, the drive from Moab to Lancaster is 12 hours and 25 minutes. That's a long day on the road. (All these distances and the map above are courtesy of   urlLink  www.randmcnally.com   .)      Right now, here is the itinerary:      Day 1:   Mpls - North Platte, NE (658 miles; 10 hr, 20 min)      Days 2 + 3:   North Platte - Moab, UT (613 miles; 10 hr, 40 min)      Day 4:   Moab - Lancaster, CA (712 miles; 12 hr, 25 min)      Day 5:   Lancaster - Camarillo (94 miles; 1 hr, 30 min)

              OK. Obviously, I am taking this cleaning thing way too seriously.       The items in the above photo were found behind my refrigerator. I wonder how long they have been there. I wonder if that little mouse was a special, homemade gift by someone's dearly loved grandma. I wonder if the fumes from my cleaning supplies are affecting my brain...

           Brenda, Sara and Kelly at the restaurant.      Last night my friends, Brenda and Sara, took me out for a bon voyage dinner at a nice restaurant in Minneapolis. We started discussing my blog, and Sara expressed disappointment in me not posting a photo of her in my Mr. Wonderful blog entry last week. (While at her home, I had taken several pictures and, as you can see from the post in question, only Mr. Wonderful made it onto the blog.) I've become somewhat of a photojournalist now that I have my blog. Every time I go out, my camera accompanies me.       Sara's comment poses a few questions:        1) Is my blog "the place" to be seen now?  Forget the exclusive bars downtown where you have to lay down three figures for a bottle of champagne just to get into the joint. Kelly's blog gets you seen by all the cool cats in town!    2) Can I really "name names"? Have I gotten over my concerns of sharing photos and names of friends and family with the web world?    I think I am still going to be somewhat cautious in this respect. I had sent an email to friends and family when I first started this blog, asking them if they minded if I included them (should the situation arise) in my blog. No one objected, but the caveats were "no last names" and "just so there's no way to trace us." I'm sure if someone really wanted to track a person down, they'd find a way. In the meantime, I'll decline from including social security numbers and other confidential information on this blog... unless there's a great story to be told!       3) Has life imitated art?  I had mentioned at dinner that I felt like our conversation resembled an episode of "Sex and the City." Sara pointed out that we hadn't been discussing "sex," which was true. But, now I'm wondering... with this blog, have I become a sort of Carrie Bradshaw, musing about life and love in the city? When we discussed my blog with our server, he had asked if my blog was "political." I guess if I had to define what my blog is I'd say it's an evolving creature. At first I thought it would be just another vehicle for friends and family to keep abreast of my goings-on, but I feel it's evolved beyond that now. Who knows what it will look like a month from now!      Well, Sara, dear, fear not! Here's your spotlight. No, James, not quite like the one in your bathroom! :-)          Brenda and Sara smile for the camera.              Beef tenderloin and matching grommets!          Emmie - Sara and Mike's Bernese Mountain dog - with Brenda.

       Help!      My apartment has very hard water.    The hard water has made my toilet bowl very rusty.   I've tried CLR, IronOut and RustOut with little change in the bowl.   I just don't know if I have enough elbow grease to get the rust out.      My sister-in-law had mentioned something called "bartender's best friend" to remove the rust.      If you know of anything that WILL remove the rust, send me an email ASAP!          My sorely neglected, rusty toilet bowl.

       I hate packing.      It's finally gorgeous outside (feels like CA!) and I'm inside packing.  :-(      Yesterday, the movers were behind schedule and showed up a half hour late. Surprisingly, they were able to load all of my stuff into the cargo van in 45 minutes. It all went well and without a hitch. teehee!      Went out for Thai food with my brother and his family last night. Very good. Went over to his place to play with the baby and watch some of the Vikings' game.       A bit stressed and anxious about the move...      This post is very dull so I shall stop now.

       Today's the "move my stuff into storage" day.  Everything is ready. I'm waiting for the rental place to open so I can get the cargo van.  Last night, I had mojotos, hoagies and a movie at Mike and Sara's place. They gave me my own Mr. Wonderful. He says "all the right things"! He'll definitely keep me company on my way out West.  According to his packaging....    Mr Wonderful has been carefully developed with today's modern woman in mind. He is complete with good looks, sense of style, sensitivity, charm, and is genuinely sincere. The perfect gift for any woman, whether single or married!   Here are some of his selfless remarks:     Actually, I'm not sure which way to go. I'll turn in here and ask directions.  (This one should come in handy if I decide to venture off the beaten path on my roadtrip.)       Here, you take the remote. As long as I'm with you, I don't care what we watch.     (I don't own a TV, so, this is irrelevent. Try again, Mr. W!)   Aw, can't your mother stay another week?    (This might come in handy at some point. I'll hold you to this, Mr. W!)    Let's just cuddle tonight.    (Always, a winner, you charmer, Mr. W!)        Kelly with Mr. Wonderful.

       I am sooooooooooo cold!  I'm wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt with a big blanket wrapped around me as I write this. The past few days have been unseasonably cold here in MN. It feels more like October than August. Here in August it's usually in the 80s with lots of humidity. Right now, it's only 57 degrees! It's been as low as the 40s at night.  I can't wait to be in sunny and warm California!  Hmmm, I'm not really superstitious, but today is Friday, the 13th. Let's see what today brings...

       I have waaaaaay too much stuff. I spent a good chunk of the day packing and then repacking boxes, determining what goes into storage, what goes to the Salvation Army and what goes to CA with me. I've already mailed 5 boxes to my friend's place in Camarillo. Now I'm wondering if I should mail my yarn. I don't like the idea, but not all decisions are easy to make. I think I may have to break down and buy that Kanga roof pouch after all. I wish I still had my Escort wagon!      It's been another day of way too much caffeine. I'm on my second Dr Pepper right now.   At least I'll work off some of the jitters by playing tennis with my friend, Julie, later on.    To give you a sense of the disaster area I am currently inhabiting, I've included a couple photos of views from my desk.      My leather sofa in disguise.          Things in boxes and things awaiting boxes.

       Hi again. Well, I was thinking about creating my own web site as a sort of online journal to keep in touch with friends and family once I move to California. But then I found Blogger, and this seems much easier. Hooray!      So, I've been very busy packing and coordinating my move from Mpls to CA. Lots and lots to do, only a couple weeks to get it all done. My gorgeous black leather sleeper sofa will be put into storage with several other things this Saturday. I've hired two guys and a cargo van to help with the task. Hopefully, everything will run smoothly.      Still have the little details of finding a place to live and a job to work out.    Oh, details schmetails!
