      WELL HELLO......  What a week, what a day, what a last few minutes. Just for the record I have tried to blogg two time in the past two days, and each time John came a calling. So, if this is a short blog you know why. I had a really draning week. Mon. I went to a time managment class. It was good and I got a lot out of it, so that was cool. Tues I had the branch all to myself and my mgr ripped on me twice, and both were un called for in my opinion. Im over it now though. wends and thurs. were just draning due to work and practice for five dollar funny. Fri. was cool, excpet my wife, ethan, and I went out to dinner, and my wife did not want to pick the resturant. So, I picked Chevys. I love that place. Anyway, they screwed up our order and my wife was not happy, it really did not bother me at all, but all she did was bitch about her meal and how much chevys sucked. Whatever.... Today was busy. i spent two hours on the kitchen this morning after my wife told me that it better be done by the time she gets home from the range. So, I made it look really nice for us, and then ethan and I went on an erran while jacquie took a nap. I did not bother me because I know see was tired and all, but was does bother is the fact that the laundry is still not finshed and put away. Whatever..... We wnet over to the BIG HOUSE this afternoon for the parkers, boyds, and the citizens house warming. IT WAS SOOOOOO LOUD, the kids out numbered the adults, but I still had a really good time hanging out with all my homies. They have done a really good job with the house I am very happy for them all.

       TODAY   Today was a great day. I heard from two old friends of mine. One is in NY and the other is in OK. It was good the hear there voices, read there words, catch up on life.  I ran another two miles today. It is starting to get alittle better, but damn running still sucks ass I tell ya. I set a goal of running 3 miles by aug. 20th witch by the way is a week from tomorrow........Im not sure if Im going to make it, but I sure as hell am going to try. Today was a good day at work. As a matter of fact work for the most part has been pretty good. With the exception of the fact that US BANK sucks ass to work for. We had to fire one of my tellers yesterday, but he was more than just my teller he was my boy. Work is not the same without him around, and the whole thing was shady from the start. My upper managment blows. I cant stand those two up stairs. But, such is life I guess, the good ones get the shaft and the bad one get to stay. I cant wait until I get the hell out of that place. My wife is 3 weeks away from finishing the acadmey. I cant wait for her to be done. She is doing so good, she will rock as a cop (as long as stays away from the ol donuts!!) I had to make one donut joke. Well that is all for now.  PEACE

       THE DAY THE BAD NEWS CAME        Yesterday was a day of bad news. You see I heard from my back ground det. and I did ot get accecpted to metro this time around. So, I have to wait until Dec. Which kinda sucks, but prob. better because this gives me more time to prepare for a Feb. academy. Just another 5 months of my life spent waiting around. It really is all good though, because I know the man upstairs is looking out, and I'm sure he knows something that I don't. But, there is  news that is worse than mine. You see a member of our community...Gregg and Hedi stokes had a problem with their house. You see there was 4 ft of water in ther back yard, water coming into the house through the power outlets. Tons of water, tons of mud, and a lot of clean up. So, if you could bepraying for the Stokes that would be cool.        on another note five dollar funny is less than 48hrs away  peace

       CLOSING A CHAPTER IN LIFE....       Today was a big day for me. You see I had a big talk with my dad today, one that will change me and him forever. (for the better that is) I closed the chapter on Golf today. Well I really did it about three weeks ago, but was to chicken to tell me dad about my decision, so it was ofically closed today. My father is a out standing man. He is one of my bestfriends, which in this day and age is a rare thing to say since a lot of folks dont even know their fathers. My dad only wants what is best for me, which is a cool thing, and I think or thought up until today that he wanted more for me to be on the PGA TOUR than I did. Ive wanted to do two thing since the age 10, score with a chick and score with a chick......oops wrong age, I meant to say Play on tour or be a cop. Well, I was luckier than most because I had a chance to choose between both my dreams and in the end I chose being a cop.      Now see I told my father this a while ago but I dont think it sunk in, because about 4 weeks ago he told me he could prob. get me a great sponsor for golf and that I really needed to sit down and think about what I wanted to do? Tuff decsion right? golf..cop, golf...cop which one?? well the answer came a lot quicker than I thought and It  was an easy one. I want to be a cop. I want to be a cop more than anything on this earth. How ever telling my dad that.....that was going to be tuff. For, those of you who dont know my dad, all I ever really hear for him is how good of a golfer I am and how he cant wait to see me kicking tiger's ass on tour. for the last two years I would hear something about golf for him  every 3 of 5 times we would talk. So, I thought tell him my big decision was going to break his heart, but It turns out that he only truly wants me to be happy, and if being a cop make me happy than he is all in. Even though he told me he is proud of me and that he is happy I have finaly dicided what I want to do with me life, I still think deep down his heart is broken, just a little. But, dad I promise I will be the best damn cop you could ever imagine, I will do you and my family proud. I love you dad, thanks for always being my support when I need it.  On a side note, I love reading my wifes blogs. She has a crazy little brain and I love how her thoughts turn into words. And I am supposed to find out about Metro this week. So, if you all could be praying for Gods will to be do in my life that would be cool.   Peace

      WORSHIP.......  So it is official.. Jacquie and I are Rodgers now. I do miss all my friends and family at Apex, and I wish you all well.  I love worship, that is when I really feel closest to God, but not when I am at church. My best worship is when I am at home in my office all alone and listening to my down loaded songs from kazaa lite (thank you Mr. Parker) I am listening to Waterdeep as I type and it just make me feel all good inside. I hope all is well to all my friends, I miss ya guys and gals. This song really does it for me......  many men will drink the rain and turn to thank the clouds. many men will hear you speak but they will never turn around  but i will not forget you you are my God my king and with a thankful heart i bring my offering and my sacfrice is  not what you can give but what I alone can give to you  a thankful heart i give a thankful prayer i pray a wild dance i dance before you a loud song i sing a huge bell i ring a live of praise i live before you  many men will pour there gold and serve a thing that shines many men will hear you speak  but they will never change their minds  but i will not forget you you my God my king and with a thankful heart i bring my offering and my sacrifice is not what you can give but what i alone can give to you................................  it feels like worship just writing down this song. I love you Father. Thank you for not forgetting about me.  Peace

      ONCE A DAY????? HA!!!!!  .......It is funny how once a day turns into once a month. (blogging that is) I hope all of my friends and loved ones had a great holiday season. This is the first christmas/new year in three years that I did not nor still have not spoke to my bro kenny parker. That is very sad. 88.8 % my fault, I got so caught up with the holidays and all the bullshit that I did not take 30min out of one of my days to call my ol friends and wish them a happy new year. I SUCK. I'M SORRY.  .......Not a day goes by though that I dont think about all of you, all of the traces of my past, present, and future. (stole that from kenny)  ......I just found a whole new level of love for my wife...you see I just read her blog and it was very touching. I really wish she would write more. she is very talanted and I think needs a little encouragment to push her along. ......it is crazy to think that in just a few days I will have been married for 1 whole year. what were you doing a year ago?? I was getting married. .......................................FINAL THOUGHT................................................... So I find out this week if I made in with Metro or not.... If you could being praying about that for me that would be cool. I really want to be a cop. Peace out.

So.........Back to Metro......... My academy starts on Feb. 23rd and it is going to be 21weeks long. Then I will go into field training for another 19 weeks.

      ONE WEEK LEFT............  I have but one week left being employed at US Bank. Thank the man up above. I don't even want to go this week, but I guess I must.  In just two weeks from today I will be starting my long 21 week journey to becoming one of the elite..The best of the best, will your name be on that plaque? YES SIR, oops sorry got carried away there with a movie quote. Now where was I oh yes a long 21 week journey to become a Metro Police Officer. I got measured for my uniforms today, and I got to try on one of the real Metro Uniforms first you know the one you get to wear when you become a real cop. When I put it on I look in the mirror and 2 thoughts ran through my mind 1. I am a lot shorter than I thought I was, and 2. I was proud to be wearing that uniform. Now, I know I'm not a cop yet, but putting on that uniform just put everything in order for me.....I'm going to do it, I going to be a cop, and it is my dream, my destiny....A older lady who was working on another uniform caught me s looking  in the mirror and she saw the big ole grin on my face, and she smiled and went back to she job, I think she knew what I was feeling.  congrats to the citizens. Welcome to our world Jack.   peace

Let me just give all you a little piece of advise.........if a police officer tells you to do something DO IT. and I will tell you why, police officers have this neat little bottle of joy called OC Spray or (pepper spray) which they carry and are aloud to use it on you anytime you are really out of line. I got sprayed today with OC Spray......take it from me IT HURTS LIKE NOTHING ELSE I HAVE EVER FELT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.    Kick me where the sun don't shine, shoot me with a taser gun, hell shoot me with a real gun, but don't ever spray me with the OC again. It sucks yall. It really sucks.    That is all for now.  Peace

      HI>>>>  So another few weeks down and only 81/2 weeks to go. I did something today that I have never do in all of my 25 years on this earth... I ran 4 miles today, and let me just tell you a little something. God has made me a lot of things but a runner I am not. I HATE RUNNING. I feel bad for the dumb ass that runs from me, because he is going to get a tazer in the back.   Everything else is good in my world. Oh yeah I spent all last week at the range shooting my gun and I qualified EXPERT. That is the second best you can get. So, watch out you fools, this ol redneck knows how to shoot.  Peace out

      WHO WANT TO BE SPIDER MAN...........  I do, I do... I want to be SPIDER MAN. ok so maybe I will just settle for being a cop. Thats right folks in just one day I will have a badge and bulletts. It has been 20 weeks and the long journey is coming to an end. I want to think all of my friends who are still my friend even though I have not seen them in the last 20 weeks. and I want to thank my wife for hanging in there with me. i love ya baby...   I finished #26 out of 70 in the academy, which I am proud of, but all in all i finished and that makes more proud than just some number. Even though I did place higher than my wife did, but who is keeping track of stuff like that.   It has been fun and I look forward to getting my life back on track.   If this cop thing dosent work out though, I will be spidey, although I will have to fight my boy gabe for the job.  peace
