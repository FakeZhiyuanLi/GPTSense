      If anyone is wondering what I have chosen for the design of the new site,  urlLink here  it is. It's still subject to tweaks and modifications. I still need to figure out what to put where it says BANNER. I can't decide if I'll put advertising banners there or rotate some banners of sites that use templates from TFA. I may also offer user submitted templates.

       I've decided I hate my job. Don't get me wrong, I like doing surveys, I just hate doing it on the phone. I'm thinking of heading over the one of the malls here and applying at the survey place there. It has no phone work that I know of. From what I know they stand in the middle of the mall and conduct surveys there.    I'm getting tired of people thinking they know everything. They seem to think that the do not call list pertains to everybody. It only pertains to people trying to sell things. It does not pertain to people doing surveys. They would know this if they actually read the law before they signed up. I'd like to think that people are intelligent, but it seems the facts point otherwise. I'm sure people really are intelligent. Perhaps as Americans we are just too busy or lazy to show it anymore. Don't take this as an attack, I'm just ranting.    Anyway, back to the whole survey thing. Sometimes my company sends a few of out in the field to do surveys in person. We go house to house and do surveys. I enjoy doing surveys in person. You see the person face to face and its harder for them to be rude that way. We went and did surveys at a baseball field once during spring training. Between 3 of us we got 100 surveys in a few hours. It was fun. I met a radio DJ and they told me to contact them to talk about designing their website for their morning show. Unfortunately I lost the business card they gave me and with my bad memory I forgot the station name. I think I will go apply at that survey place in the mall.

       As it gets closer to the new season of   urlLink Stargate: SG-1  , I'm seeing more information about the spinoff series,   urlLink Stargate: Atlantis  . The commercials make it look interesting to say the least. It looks like one of the better spinoffs there have been with other TV shows. It premiers July 16th. I may even request the day off work to watch it.    Stargate Command has spent the past year searching for the Lost City of the Ancients, a fabled city created thousands of years ago by the same advanced race that built the Stargate network. When SG-1 finds a vital clue, Dr. Weir prepares her team to step through the gate to the distant Pegasus Galaxy. What they find is the legendary city of Atlantis - including new technologies, new allies, and a frightening new enemy! But without enough power to gate back home, the explorers may have been given a one-way ticket.   On a related note, maybe I'll work on a Stargate template to offer on my website. I will look into it after I finish the redesign of  urlLink Templates For All . I also have to edit a few templates to make them more compatible with  urlLink Mozilla .

      I'm currently working on redesigning my  urlLink website  and coding a PHP back-end for it from the ground up. I'm also making a few more templates for people to download. I have no idea how long the re-coding of the back-end will take.    I plan to have features such as:     Frequently Asked Questions    More Web Tools    More Than 1 Category Of Templates    Many More!

      I've decided  urlLink Aqua Teen Hunger Force  is the coolest cartoon ever. Its one of those cartoons where the more intelligent you are, the more funny it is. It's got so many inside jokes. Its funny.

       Template Page   I can't decide it I want to have the template page display 6 templates on a page or have a page for each template. If I have 6 on a page It will have a screenthot, download, and view links. If I have a page for each template I can have # downloaded, template name, rating, view link, screenshot picture, download link, and even some text about the template.   Forums   On another note I'm waiting for the  urlLink forum software  that I plan to use to release the latest version. I will then work on a modification to it to display resent forum topics on the main page of the site. Hopefully that will stimulate conversations in the forums.

      Well today was a long day at work. Last night I fell asleep at 1am this morning in front of the computer, and woke up at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep. I was so exhausted that I was actually felling asleep at work. Its kind of funny I talk on the phone for a living and I fell asleep while talking. I'm glad I wasn't monitored today or I may have lost my job.

       For those of you that don't know what a MUD is, here's a short description:     A MUD (Multiple User Dimension, Multiple User Dungeon, or Multiple User Dialogue) is a text based computer program which users can log into and explore. Each user takes control of a computerized persona/avatar/incarnation/character. You can walk around, chat with other characters, explore dangerous monster-infested areas, solve puzzles, and even create your very own rooms, descriptions and items. They have been around for over 20 years. They were the games that inspired newer graphical games such as EverQuest and Dark Ages of Camelot.

       I've begun work redesigning and updating the  urlLink Age of War  website. Its turning out fairly nice. Its not turning out as good as I hoped, because I just can't come up with original designs anymore. I've shown it to a few people and they love it, so I guess its good enough. I just dont feel its my best work. Design aside, I know my HTML skills are still as good as they ever were. That means the content of the site will pose no problem at all.    Aside from the website, I don't seem to have any other duties as an Immortal on Age of War. I still need to take care of standard things, help newbies, make sure people aren't being disruptive, etc. However if people are being disruptive and they don't stop when I say stop, I have to post about it on the message boards so those with more power than I can do something. Overall, its pretty much like being a hall monitor.

       I need to go learn the new functions in  urlLink PHP5 . I don't even know OOP. I don't understand OOP. I've read about it and it gets more confusing more and more everytime I read about it.
