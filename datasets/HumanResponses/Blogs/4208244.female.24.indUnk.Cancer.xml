      So YEAH!!! We were able to purchase the big kit for my hostess...so she can get started being a Passion Parties Consultant and doing what I am in about a week. She already has parties lined up. I'm so excited for her.  The party went really well and was tons of fun. :-) I stuck the Glow Boy to the TV as a demo. ;-) It's a fun little toy...you should check it out on my website..  urlLink www.NoNeedToBeShy.com . :-)  The ride back to Fresno, after the party, went good. I was listening to Evenescence and lovin' it! They are soooo great! Her voice to me is just amazing. Since I'm a singer as well I love to hear new and unique voices coming onto the scene. :-)  The trip home, the next day, went without a hitch. I was a little afraid I was about to be pulled over by the cops a couple times...but managed to miss the pleasure of a ticket...hehe. It wouldn't be so bad if my car were current with registration right now...but that is a story for another day.    Well, I'm off to get some work done...maybe I'll come in and post later tonight! Until then...Stay Passionate!

      I'm in Fresno for a Consultant Passion Party. It isn't until tomorrow, but I came down a day early to try and fit in a meeting with my other consultants down here. The party tomorrow is to sign up a new consultant in this area. :-) She is having a party to raise some money to help her buy I demo kit. When I do these, I split the profit with the potential consultant if she puts it towards a demo...that way she doesn't have to come up with all of it on her own and can get started sooner with this awesome business. :-)  The hotel room was really drab so I went to Target to get some Tiki Tiki gear. :-) I have a beaded curtain in pink, orange, yellow, and purple hanging in the bathroom doorway...Tea Laterns on a string of lights hanging behind the bed....a few candles...a red body pillow....and a light box with 4 saying that you can slide in and out of it (Happy Hour, Tiki Lounge, Open For Business, Last Call) above the TV. It's tons better now. I tried staying in a new hotel this time...and it was a bad decision on my part...Hehe...  Have you ever tried the Mini Charleston Chews...they come in a box and are supper yummy...you should try them if you haven't... :-)  Hopefully the party goes well tomorrow and she can afford the biggest kit! I'll post again and tell how it goes. :-)

      Today I was feeling pissy and indecisive.  I worked on transfering information from my old desktop to my new and shiny laptop.  :-)  This proved harder than anticipated...  This is where my pissiness came from.  Eventually after hours upon hours trying to get somewhere with my piece of junk desktop...I gave up....and came back to where I'm house sitting and stewed.   I thought...Indian food has been sounding totally yummy for weeks...and you know...I dediced to have some delivered.   Ahh...it just came and I feel my spirits rising already!  You never know the importance of indian food until time like these.... ;-)  I'm off to munch!  What a way to start my blogging...hehe...
