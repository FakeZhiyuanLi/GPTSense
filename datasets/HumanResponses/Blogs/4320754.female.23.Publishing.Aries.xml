      Where can you find the best cupcake in New York City?  This perennially-important question has plagued me since a friend told me that instead of a cake at her wedding she had cupcakes from The Cupcake Cafe stacked on tiered pedestals. What a cute idea, I thought. Then, I tasted the cupcakes from Cupcake Cafe. They taste like dried-out sponges with tasteless, greasy frosting. One thing that these cupcakes do have going for them--they are beautiful. They come decorated with the most delicate and pretty flowers, all colors and types. But this still does not take away from the fact that they are tasteless and hard in ways that a cupcake should never be.  In another cupcake moment, I saw Carrie and Miranda (a la Sex and the City) gobbling up cupcakes from Magnolia Bakery. They made them look so tasty as they ate them, as they licked the colored frosting from their fingers and practically stuffed the things in their mouths. Now, to taste one of these mini cakes did not give me nearly as much pleasure as they seemed on television (now, isn't that always the case...). I don't know if they use lard or butter in their frosting, but I found these cakes as tasteless as those from Cupcake Cafe. Blah, not worth the trek downtown.  Now, the really delicious cupcakes in my opinion come from Buttercup Bake Shop. For one, the cake is soft, slightly toothsome, and dense, but not hockey-puck-dense. The frosting is clearly made with butter, as is the cake, and the flavors they come in are just divine and oh-so-playful--red velvet, devils food with marshmallow frosting, a lady baltimore with a jewel-like maraschino cherry on top and my favorite--vanilla with chocolate frosting. In a way the cupcakes remind me of cake made from box mix--but only because they are very buttery-tasting and that's what I always loved about those darned Betty Crocker mixes.  There was an article in the New York Times awhile ago in which some man went on a quest to find the perfect cupcake in New York City. I haven't done nearly as extensive research--considering the fact that my research consisted only of eating cupcakes from these 3 establishments. And he deconstructed every cupcake like only the New York Times food writers can. I can't remember what cupcake he deemed the best in the city, but my vote, by far, goes to the Buttercup Bake Shop. YUM!

      I am intrigued by this whole blog thing. A good friend of mine from way-back-when has a blog, which I read when I can, and I thought: What the hell?! Why not start my own? Too few people get to hear what I think about all day--food.  Beginnings is an appropriate first post, as it points to the beginning of this blog and also to the beginning of my honest and dedicated effort to become a chef. I've gotten myself a job as a stage, or kitchen intern, in a local restaurant in Essex County, NJ and am starting to formulate some kind of a plan as to how I will reach my end goal, well, my two end goals--chefdom and opening my own restaurant.  I will report on my progress and most likely talk and talk and talk about restaurants, great meals, and why I think everyone should start their meals with a glass of champagne!  Cheers!
