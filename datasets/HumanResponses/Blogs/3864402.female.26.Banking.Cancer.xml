      D'you ever wonder why when you and your mate is having the best&nbsp;relationship ever, all your male friends seem to just pop out of the blue bubbling with romantic feelings for you? Or it just so happens that you end up making friends with some hottie? and.... D'you ever notice or wonder when you are depressed and need some sort of companion other than your mate, it just so happens that not a single "brotha" is in sight. That always makes me wonder....  Life is such a "beech" sometime shells, sometimes stones either way you'll always find one of them.   &nbsp;

      I believe I have a huge crush on Mos Def, now mind you he's not one of the most handsome guys around, but he sure is one hot chocolate!  The first time I start liking him was when I saw him in the movie "Brown Sugar" he was fiiinnneee! and I jus luv the was he talks. Then I saw him on this other movie "Italian Job" he acted a little goofy but he was still cute.  I started to see him more and more.....what set it off was seeing him in Alecia Keyes music video "You don't know my name", he was the bomb...!!!! I tell you.   Of course I had to go on the net and do some research on him and view more pictures of him. He lights up my life (my fantacy life that is)...  Ahhhhhh!!!....Mos Def...  Okay back to reality!   I still believe that one fine day I'm gonna become famous, not one of thoes BIG celebs. but famous enough to be noticed by some very important people. I still want to persue my modeling career, but for now it's put on pause because of school...but the thing is while school I'm not getting any younger!  I'm gonna try out for Pulse one wednesday (audition days) just for the fun of it, if it does not work then atleast I can say I tried.

      This is the start of a new day, my birtday that is and I sincerely hope that nothing goes wrong. I started out kind-o-rocky but it's all smooth out now. It was a challenging week, my feet are killing me from all that walking just to find a decent pair of shoe, a bag and an inside shirt! No cooldestiny I did not buy them myself, my boyfriend did this time...:) but what sucks though is that I have Stats. class this evening "Yucghhk"!!  What would realy ruin it is if I got a test, which I'm not sure of right now - very nerve racking-   Ahhhhh!! what a lovely day!

      I believe I'm on this wonderful but strength taking journey to stardom or just making it through each level of life. At times I feel like my burden is so heavy "this must be the end" but I've made it thus far mostly with the help of GOD!  I've been working for seven years now and I feel like I'm at a standstill somewhat. Working with a "unnamed" financial Instituition has made life very challenging. I thought that being a staff one would be made to feel like family, but instead I feel like "CRAP". In every business place there are certain benefits that one gets. Who would have thought that these ascertaining these so called benefits would drive you "nuts" or come close to send you to the morgue or the mad house.  Why do I stay and endure all this you might ask?? Jobs are real hard to come by and it's no use jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.  Hence I'll bear it a little longer until better comes knocking at my door. My mother always said nothing happens before its time. Until then I'll try and make the most of it.
