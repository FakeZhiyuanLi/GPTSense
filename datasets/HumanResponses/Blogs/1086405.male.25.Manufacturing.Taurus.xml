      HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!  My resolutions: lose more weight.  I lost about 15 pounds this year, thanks mainly to my job and stress.  By doing simple things like more exercise, less fatty food, less soda, and less candy, my goal by April is to drop 20 pounds.  5 pounds a month, totally achievable.    Do more work.  That means getting up earlier.  That means less late night thingies.  But that also means less working late, more day time to have fun.  Find God, again.  I found him once through science, and now I'm going to do it again through soul searching.    I hope your resolutions go well too.    Have a great new year.  Hopefully 2002 was good for you too.

      Adding in more thoughts before I go to bed, I realize that Christmas and New Years, despite the blandness of them at times, I never forget that there are people out there who can't celebrate the holiday for various reasons.  Separation from family via death, duty(soldiers and the like) or hardship is something horrible.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to run this into a guilt trip.  What I do want to say is this.  The fact that we can celebrate the holidays at all are a huge blessing.  I am always happy to be in the company of my family.  Sometimes, I wish that I had options, but family is ALWAYS a good thing.  Be thankful for what you have.  Celebrate the simple things that we take for granted.   Happy holidays.

      I'd like to just say that a speed limit of 25 mph just about everywhere in the city is ludicrous.  Let me provide some background.  Alameda is an old town.  It's got a lot of history, it's got a lot of people too, particularly for a residential town.  Parts of them are pretty bad, especially near the Oakland border.  Parts of them are EXTREMELY rich, like Bay Farm Island.  New homeowners are particularly loaded.  Houses here go for $600,000 and up.  People here tend to be older, as far as I can tell, or family people.    What does this mean?  Apparently, it means that driving at reasonable speeds is unfathomable to them.  That means people with any sort of driving capability, like me, are sentenced to drive at some nutsoid speed like 25 mph.  School zones?  Fine.  Hospital zones? Fine.  But main streets and thoroughfares at 25 mph? That is, I reiterate, INSANE.  Try it sometime!  Drive down the street, at 25 mph.  See if that doesn't get you a few... fingers.  This is unreasonable.  In fact, it takes a good 25+ minutes to go 5 miles.  Idiots.    I don't know if the police enjoy it.  I don't even know if it's their prefernce to do it or enforce it.  They're doing their job, enforcing the law.  And that's fine.  But this is just idiocy.  In an age where the freeway speed has been upped to 65 mph, 25 mph in any road in the city is sheer idiocy.  I wonder how many lives this regulation really saves.

      Watching American Idol.    Now normally I don't watch these reality shows, but for some reason, this is a little different.  Three guys decided to blow off their practice sessions on American Idol to go out and party.  Some observations: First, you girls that went home with them or did scandalous things to get their attention or get on the camera?  There is a word for people like you.  SLUTS!!!!  "Whatever.  You don't know me."  I know that people like you are complete wastes of protoplasm.  You are the filth of the Earth who don't understand what the reality of life is.  I hope you got a souvenir of some sort... the uncurable kind.  As for the guys?  WTF is wrong with you people?  You've got no commitment, no responsibility, and I hope you fail in everything you try to do because that's what you deserve.  No priorities, probably spoiled and sorry little shits.  And this is not just for those three, but for the rest of you shits who think you can just ditch everything and leave it to the winds.  The world rightfully belongs to those who work hard, who try their best, who are responsible, who earn their keep.  We deserve the world, you deserve to rot and die.  To the rest of the world:  be responsible.  Understand the reality of the world.

      I'm an idiot.    I completely forgot that this weekend is Chinese New Year!!! I'll be out with my family. That's not the issue though.  The issue is.... I invited my friends and coworkers for a housewarming!  On Chinese New Year!!!! No crisis though, since at least I can hopefully move it to Sunday *crosses fingers*

      Back in the saddle!  That would be the phrase of the day.  I feel a little better about things lately, and am hoping for the best in life.  I'm doing a lot of cleanup around here.  This place feels a lot more like home nowadays.

      Let's put it this way.  George Lucas is a hack.  If you want quality sci fi, you don't go Lucas, you go Tolkien.  He sucked as a filmmaker, and the only reason we think Star Wars is any good is because it's one of the first.  There were some cool concepts, I agree, but now, with hindsight and retrospect, you can see it for what it is.  Cliché and run of the mill scifi.  The background details are filled in as he goes, with no planning.  Midi-chlorians? WTH?  Oh well.  Another week is coming up, and I'm hoping for the best.  Just bored and passing the time...

      I was thinking of ways to make use of my time while I relax at home.  And I thought of something ridiculously simple!  I don't know why I didn't think of it before-- what do y'all think of this!!!  Every commercial break during the shows I watch, I'll do one of the following:  push ups, sit ups, or lifts.  That, and I've decided to cut down my red meat intake.  Two things I've decided to do, and at the end of January, I'm going to add something else.  I don't know what that is yet, but I'm going to do it.    As it goes, I'm cleaning my apartment slowly but surely. Most of the clutter is gone, and by this weekend it'll be ready for guests.  Next week, I hope I can get a little house warming going.  What can I serve?  I have no idea what to do... maybe order dim sum from Chinatown?  A friend offered to bring his barbecue.  Another bakes the best pizza I've tasted this side of New York.  Both have offered to help out =)  On the personal side, things are pretty dull as things go, since I'm settling down into adulthood.  That's an interesting proposition in and of itself.  I don't really consider myself a child anymore, but I know that so many of my contemporaries are nothing but.  I decided that it's time to carve out my own identity.  How do I do that?  First, I have to reach the point where I'm comfortable with my identity and my physical shape.

      Now that I'm back from training, I wonder about my job and where I'm going with it.  I feel pumped and enthusiastic because of all the great people I met and all the fun I had, but now that I'm back in the saddle, I'm well aware of a few gaps in my abilties.  I'd like to work on my leadership ability, and moreover, work on myself.  Learn more about the science and the technology behind what I do for a living, and moreover, make a name for myself.  But now I am fighting to keep from getting sucked back into the drudge that I got trapped in a while ago.  I want to be myself and to be the best.  The question is how.  Today I'm going to talk about my doubts with my boss, and hope for the best.  My life overall is okay, and I'm overextending a little bit, but in the end I hope it works out.

      The day before I go home to Alameda is here, and you know what?  I'm sad to see it all go.  I had a lot of fun out here, and I learned quite a few things too.  Made friends, learned lessons, broke some egos.  In the end, traveling for work isn't all that horrible, and I look forward to the next time.  There is no better feeling than making new friends, especially when it's going to be an easy thing to keep in touch with them.  I hope that it'll happen, and I hope my flight doesn't get too delayed by snow.  But seriously, the times have changed.

      The start of my second and final week in Washington DC and life is still good, but I realize that there's so much more that needs to be done.  I wonder to myself if there's more to my existence than believing in God and seeking to improve myself.    I realize that despite the cynicism that surrounds me at work, that I am, at the very least, doing something positive for the community at large, in small ways.  In the same way, I should be changing my life in the small and little ways for the better, and I realize now that I, much like the city of Berkeley, have been keeping myself tied to the past a little too much.    But is that so wrong?  My days in High School and College led me to meet quite possibly the best friends I have so far.  It's taught me much about myself, especially how I deal with hardship and difficulty, and how I want to try to control the world around me and yet, fail at times, because there's too much to consider.  What do I want to do with my life from here on in?  Do I want to continue with school and get a master's degree?  I'm sure that sometime in the near future, that's something I am intent on pursuing.  But now, what I see as priority one is to develop myself in the world.  Am I just another person with a 9 to 5 job, getting by with as little as possible?  Is this something I plan to pursue to the fullest?  Or is this a stepping stone to something greater?  As I am surrounded by colleagues from far and wide, across the country, the question is posed once again.    Who am I?  What distinguishes me from these people around me?  How much of that is bound to my past?  I feel that it's time to start over, now that I'm living a life separate from my history, just how much do I let my history define me now?  What defines me?  I think the answer to that one is simple enough:  Family, Friends, Faith.  I believe that there's more to life than just this.  Now to go out and find what it is.

      So at the end of my first full day in Washington, DC, what can I say?  Life is good so far.  With good people, good food, and most of all, good accomodations, I'm looking forward to these two weeks.  A friend, thank god, has granted me the greatest boon of all: remote internet access.    Hopefully I can post more about my trip here, but if not, then oh well, so be it.    It's snowing!  It's been a while since I've been in snow, and even longer since I've gotten to throw a snowball or two... hehehe...

      Current Media:  Simple and Clean  by Utada Hikaru   Funny things go through my mind when I can't sleep, and am awake at 6 am.  I'm wondering about gas prices... They're insanely high lately, with some places having good ol' 87 at almost, if not over, $2.  Part of me understands that fear of the coming war is probably partially to blame, as is the crisis in Venezuela, which, to my surprise, is a large importer of oil.  Mostly, I blame greedy gas company management, and to a lesser extent, individual gass station owners/operators.  Our current society is highly dependent on gasoline, and this dependence is most deftlly illustrated by our willingness to pay this price.  I'm no greenpeace tree hugging hippie or anything, but as a scientist, this just pushes me to further embrace the quite obvious need to develop alternative fuel sources.  There's a risk as it stands of having nuclear power plants, but that and perhaps, solar power are perhaps the answer.  On the war:   People are being sent out there, away from their families and loved ones.  Told basically, get ready to die.  Most of all, for a cause that not everyone believes in.  I am not a fan of this issue, but at the same time, everyone has a job.  Tragically, ol' Dubya is trying to fill his father's shoes, and all in all, just isn't thinking.  I do agree that something needs to be done about Iraq and other a$$hole regimes and countries.  Personally, however, one should take care of 1) the economy and 2) more pressing issues, like North Korea.  What we have here is the equivalent of some idiot making threats by waving a gun in the air.  The difference is, this idiot is willing to fire that gun.    Reminds me of someone I knew...  He demanded a Supra from his mother, or else, he said, he would join a gang.  First, this is San Bernardino, so there were no real gangs, just a bunch of wannabe punks.  Second, if my son ever said that to me, first thing I'd do is make sure he doesn't say much for a looooong time.  Bottom line, the mom gave in.  Bought the brat a Supra.  What happens?  The idiot gets arrested for street racing anyway.  NEVER give in to threats like that.  Everyone will live to regret it.  Anyway, people are going to war out there... I wish they didn't have to do it, but since things are the way they are, I wish them a safe return to their families.  I know of several people in general and specifically that deserve nothing less than to be reunited with their fathers/sons/daughters/mothers/sisters/brothers.

      Continuing my previous entry, I just want that all to lead to this conclusion.  If I don't like you, trust me, there's a damned good reason why.  Not out of plain spite or malicious, capricious action.  You've probably done something very, very bad to me or any of my friends.  Careful analysis of who you are, what you've done... Trust me, you'll figure it out.    As it goes, things are running normal these days, surprisingly.  Work is taking its toll on my funtime, but that's how it goes I guess...  more later.

      Current Media:  Dear Momma  by 2pac   When I first started at my job, I worked my damnest (is that a word?) to prove that I was one of the best, or at the very least, competent.  Now, as the time draws near to end my probation, I'm feeling pressure.  Rumors of a reduction in force are making things a little skittish at work, though on a positive note, things are nice and mellow with my coworkers.  After all this time, things are settling in, and people's true colors are beginning to show.    I am one of those people that needs to be liked by everyone-- I can't stand the thought that someone dislikes me for something I did.  But at the same time, I am very sure of myself, established in my moral and ethical code of conduct.  For me, the world is a series of flashes of black and white, of good and evil, of right and wrong.  So to realize that there are people at work who are screwing my coworkers over, or who indulge their spoiled, selfish needs and wants... Argh!  I have high expectations... as a man of both science and God, I believe in an order in the universe that needs to be kept, of justice, of righteousness.  I've been accused of being a zealot, and if that's the case, then so be it.  I will be justice.  I have to do the right thing whenever I can.  That's how it is.   To my friends, I see myself as the Knight, the pillar of support.  I try my best to be generous, to be kind, to listen.  Every person I meet gets a degree of respect, one due a person worthy of living through the gift given by God.  A happy person, enjoying life and angry with the injustices of the world, taking what steps I can to make the world a better place for every person I touch.  I slide into whatever role is necessary, be it support or leadership.  I seek to get things done as soon as I can, I seek to take care of business before pleasure.  I try to do the right thing.  But to that extreme, I can be a self righteous pig.  When I say something, I make the best effort to be right about it.  And when I say something, I'm usually right.  That combined with my strong (and generally black-and-white) views on morality and ethics, tend to leave the impression of me being an angry person who's good ad keeping that rage suppressed.    I loathe confrontation, but will not back down if it is truly necessary.  I need to be loved, and yet am willing to sacrifice for the greater good.  I believe in justice, but feel that sometimes, vengeance is part of that justice.  I will always be that Knight, the shadow that follows, never abandoning.  I will always try to aspire to a greater good.  But can others be the same?    For all my suffering, I'm well aware that there are others who suffer more than me.  To the world, I offer an outstretched hand in aid.  To those who cross me and have earned my ire, I hope you understand why that is.  Understand also that I always try to be fair, even with those that shouldn't deserve the chance.  And for pity's sake, do the right thing.

      I watched American Idol today-- the bad auditions.    Ugh...  The first time I saw Keith perform, it hurt me physically.  The second time, I felt pity for the guy. But then again the guy has no business being in a professional contest like that. Some people just need to be reminded of reality and cleansed of delusion.  Every now and then, I'm one of those people.    As much as I loathe certain things in life and other things, I've learned recently that one of my friends is suffering very much right now.  An acquaintance of mine in college died, and even though we weren't that close, it struck a nerve... any death that touches you changes your life...  And now it might happen again.  I don't like seeing good people suffer.  Saying prayers to keep things all well and good.

      As it goes, did you watch the end of Joe Millionaire?  I personally think it was really cool.  Without spoiling it for anyone who didn't see it, and if you don't want it spoiled, by all means don't hit CNN or other sites with entertainment news.  They love spoiling these things.  It was a decent season overall, and I think in the end, it was a fun ride.    A friend and I discussed legal implications with these women, and I'd be frankly surprised if any legal action came of this series.  We both agreed that this was a big publicity stunt for these people and their careers, and if nothing else, it's a shot at publicity.  I felt a little bad, but let's face it, anytime you're going on TV, get ready for anything.  I missed Dragnet yesterday... =(

      Happy Valentine's Day to all!  Belated, anyway.  It was a normal day for me, no bad feelings, no good ones either.  It's been a pretty neutral year for me, with nothign good and nothing bad going on.  Things are going well otherwise.  My health is not improving, but it's not deteriorating either.  I've been cutting down on the fried foods and the red meat.  Anyway, work is great and all, but with my probation ending soon, I feel like I have to prove myself to people all over again.  I'm one of the better new hires in my opinion, but the time is coming.  This is the last few weeks they'll have to fire me... easily.  But I just gotta keep on going at the pace I'm going, and a few weeks from now, it's time for an audit.  From there, I just have a few things to schedule.

      Current Media:  Regulate  by Warren G feat. Nate Dogg , It's my Life  by Bon Jovi   Back in the saddle!  After weeks of training and Import review, I'm finally back on my regular function!!! In other words, I'm back on the field laying out the regulation law, baby!  I love my job because of the flexibility it gives me, and the fact that I generally don't have to sit around the office.    Today was generally a bad day, and I don't really feel like talking about it.    But I am hopeful for the near future.  My apartment is now officially home.  I'm set in terms of that, so my life is stabilizing a bit.  My diet is getting better, and I'm doing more and more exercise these days.  I think that I still have some personal turmoil to sort through, though all in all, I'm very happy with my life.  I have some issues though, in that people LOVE to gossip at my workplace.  I've decided to avoid dealing with these people as much as I can.  I'm going to get a lot of rest tonight, since this is the first real inspection I'm going to do since getting back from training.  Look out world!

      A little bit of added info that I plan to continue to add in, so y'all can get a glimpse of what a day in the life is like.   Current Media:  Dragnet on TV Current Snack:  crackers and Pepsi.  My God, the writers of Dragnet are genius!!!  It was a really nifty thing they did to get the proof!    "You know why cops serve arrest warrant at six am?  Because suspects are sleepy, drowsy and full of attitude." "They may not be telling the truth, but fingerprints don't lie."  --Joe Friday, on handing a suspect a photo, asking him to identify it, and yet getting a negative response.  For the ones that don't understand what happened, you know what happens when you handle photos with your bare hands?  You get fingerprints on them as a result of the natural oils humans secrete.  You get someone to handle a photo, you've got his fingerprints.

      Hey hey!    So my little shindig went down well, thanks (once again) to my colleague and friend, Dan Geffin.  The pizza was a big hit, and all i essentially did was provide the venue =)  I had a pretty good turnout with about 15-20 people, and festivities closed up relatively early at about 11:00 pm or so.  Not bad for a nice, quiet, boring kinda guy like myself!  We had some surprise guests, and some of the usuals as well.  Tons of fun all trhoughout, especially when the Dance Dance Revolution pads were broken out again!  I only wish I had photos.  It was a great time had by all I hope.    I am certainly more than eager to see this happen again.

      Regarding my little rant on the third, perhaps i should explain.  There was an ad that depicted the act of shark finning.  In other words, fishermen catch sharks, cut off their fins, and  dump them back into the ocean, still breathing.   Now, I know that everyone has to make a living, but that just makes me sick.  As it stands...  Today at Costco, my friend Dan had to leave the shopping cart at the register for a second to get a block of cheese(he's gonna make pizza for my little shindig!  What a guy).  Anyway, he comes back, and there's this guy behind him in line, who apparently gives him this dirty look.  This time, I'm running in, carrying some stuff in a second cart.  So as I start loading, the guy goes, "It's ok, feel free to cut in line anytime!"  Let me explain it to you.  This guy thinks Dan cut in line (he didn't) and thinks that I'm making it worse by adding more stuff.  What an ass.  What's with people these days?  Would it kill someone to ask, excuse me, I believe there's a line here?    Whatever.  I'm glad I'm beyond such things and have a little more class and common courtesy than that.

      More thoughts...  Man, part of me is so glad I'm out of college, since I no longer have to deal with much of the idiocy that comes with youth.  One of the advantages of being surrounded by professionals is, of course, professionalism.  I'm glad that I am where I am, my job gives me the opportunity to learn about new things.  From industry to manufacturing to science, I'm thrilled to find out how things work.    It's 2 am now, and I have to go to work early, so off to bed I go.  Shindig at my place this Saturday.  Get in touch with me if you wanna swing by! =)

      I just watched the new Dragnet with Ed O'Neill.  This cop show is interesting to me because to me, it's one of the first few shows that I'm aware of that focuses mainly on the cop work, not the personal life of said cops.  It was a great first episode, really unsettling, but a solid show.  Ed O'Neill was particularly interesting, since my familiarity with him comes from Married With Children.  I don't know much about the original Joe Friday, but I do know that Ed did a very good job separating himself from his old character.  There was a vast difference in his movements, attitudes, and even the sneer he makes as Joe versus Al.  I think he did an outstanding job.  As for the rest of the cast, his partner Frank Smith, played by Ethan Embry, exudes n00bishness.  I wonder if that's intentional?  Ed has a very strong personality that overshadows Ethan's but that just reinforces the show I guess.  All in all that was pretty good.

      I'm ashamed to say, but I was completely unaware of the tragedy involving the Space Shuttle Columbus.    This... this travesty is indicative of the idiocy that runs rampant today.  NASA had it's day during the space race, and I have no questions about the importance of space exploration.  But... something about this angers me.  As a scientist, I know that we scientists as a whole tend to focus on the quest for knowledge and can ignore some aspects of life, but these morons, given that something is wrong, what do they do? NOTHING!  I was asleep when it all went down.    But it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth...  I want to know one thing...  What paranoid, conspiracy driven nut asked if this was terrorist related?  The shuttle was at frickkin' 40 miles above the surface!    God save these astronauts' souls.  I hope they're in a better place, and I hope NASA learns their god-damned lesson and to take care of the most important things first... human safety.  Even the smallest deviation needs to be taken care of.  And the classic several-hundred-thousand-dollar toilet seat needs to be revisited.  There's something missing in all this.  My soul is saddened at all this...

      A friend of mine was in a bad accident this weekend.  Generally speaking, he's ok, but keep him in your prayers... I'm going to see him tomorrow.  Of course, now that I'm being "paid" to write about Magic, I've got a horrible case of writer's block.  Dammit.

      It's been a GOOOOOOOOD weekend.  Let's go backwards. Today, I went to a friend's place for a barbecue and hanging out.  That went really well, I had some fun.  I met some great people, and look forward to seeng more of them.  It was great!  I got to relax, have some great grub... what else can I say?  I made some great trades at the game store recently.  I got rid of quite a bit of junk, and played a couple of games too.  It was fun all around.    I got a guitar, and am still messing with it.  Getting better, and am slowly learning "Horse With No Name."  The hardest part of guitar is the chords!!! My fingers still hurt, though in the end, I feel it will all be worth it.    I went shopping for some clothes, and ended up with some great shoes.  I really gotta clean up though, since I can't find some stuff that I bought from the outlet.    Finally, I won the weekly contest for writing on Star City Games.  Well, that's a bit of a lie, since I won for several articles over time.  The one I wrote wasn't the best, but they felt that my overall contributions were worthy of an award.  Moreover, they offered me a featured writer spot!!! I don't know how much that involves, but I'm pretty sure that involves store credit.  Which is fine by me, though cash would have been better.  I'm just thrilled to be doing something I like, and being 'paid' for it too.  The war is still going on, and though I'm far from numb, I'm just going to say my prayers and wish for a quick and safe return for our boys and girls out there.  I hope for the best for them.  Good night to all.

      Well, I gots me a guitar...  I'm planning to learn  as soon as I can, as fast as I can.  r0x0r!!!  I picked up a Yamaha guitar for a decent price from Guitar Center.  My fingers are sore from strumming and (moreso) from holding chords.  I want to at least get good enough to play the following songs:  1) More Than Words  by Xtreme  2) Everywhere  by Michelle Branch  3) No Such Thing and  Your Body Is A Wonderland  by John Mayer   All very mellow, very cool things... I expect the worst/hardest one to learn to be No Such Thing, which goes at a pretty rapid pace.  I think it's about time that I started to learn a new skill...  Guitar is a nice little portable instrument.  Today, I learned how to tune a guitar with a reference pitch, and what the E minor chord is.  Everywhere, I believe, is F, G and C, so I'm working on it.  It's almost time to file taxes!  Augh!

      Regarding the war in Iraq, I've seen enough.  There are several issues I want to address.  First, to the anti-war protesters.  We're at war now.  How about you stop pissing everyone off and wasting our time, let the country run well, and work towards getting our armed forces home as soon as possible.   Iraq is under a brutal regime, and regardless of Bush's intent, we are moving to take them out.  That is a good thing, you idiots.  Worry about ending the war as soon as possible and quit your bitching.  Second, to that asshole who threw the grenades in our own camp:  If you're dissatisfied, you talk about it, not toss grenades in, you little buttmonkey!  Dammit... what you did didn't help your cause.  Here's something for you to think about, and I hope you get it in the neck:  What you did is treason, and treason is punishable by death.  What you did is beneath contempt.  I hope someone sticks a sausage down your throat and a hungry ferret up your @$$.  Third, to Iraq:  you ingrates!  We're doing something for YOUR good!  Dammit!  When you need aid or cash, you beg and praise the US, but when it comes to doing something, you bitch at us.  Idiots... you deserve Saddam.  (note:  not to the innocents)  Justice needs to be served.  This is how we do it.    Take a news announcement to Iraq.  "We're going to raze the damn capital to the ground.  You will walk slowly down this road, tell us if you're military, and if you are you will be detained as such but be treated fairly.  After X days, we will flatten this place."  No precision, no nothing.  Just raze it.  Then, you take all these protesters, cuff them, ID them, and fine the shit out of them for wasting everyone's time as needed.  Then you take this treasonous sonovabitch... and... nail a Muslim turban to his head.  That has nothing to do with racism or prejudice, it's just plain punishment.  Justice needs to be meted out, and though I trust that in the end, God will make things right, sometimes the just have to take things into their own hands.

      You know, I give up.    It's been almost a year since I started my job, and I still don't have any business cards, order forms for which were passed out in the first few weeks of my employment.  The office is so inept at handling this that most of the people in the office have gone to private companies themselves to get their cards printed.  I was naive and trusted that the office would do its job.  This, mind you, is after it took them 4 bloody months to get my phone running.  4 months!  I had to share a line, and believe me, in my line of work I need my own phone.  And now this.  I could go ahead and spend the amount that cards would cost and end my personal humiliation.  I should, and most likely will.  But I am downright pissed off and embarassed to be associated with these people.  My employers have a poor reputation, and now I know why.

      The reality sank in today that we are at war, and this isn't going to be a cakewalk by any means.  People are dying out there, and we still have idiots out in San Francisco wasting money, time and resources instead of helping the nation come together.  Everyone should be praying for the safe return of our boys out there, and not trying to be self righteous.  And it's time to shut up.  Otherwise, things are okay.  Things are about to get busy at work, and you know what? I'm ready for it.  I've been doing decently so far.  I can't really talk about it, and i don't really want to...  Magic The Gathering was fun today, and I only wish that more people played with me =)

      Okay.  Let's go down the list. mmmmmmmm....  Tina Fey Kylie Minogue Angie Harmon Elizabeth Hurley Kelly Hu Zhang Zi Yi Fann Wong Ming Na (Wen) Sophia Choi Lisa Ling Bridget Fonda Jennifer Connely Christina Park Allison Hannigan Michelle Branch Kristen Kreuk Faith Hill Shania Twain Coco Lee Elisha Cuthbert Linda Park Jolene Blalock  I could keep listing names, but that's a sampling of the standards of beauty in my mind.  One name that stands out above the rest is, of course, Christina Park.  She hosts CNN's Quick Cast on the web.  Check out her profile here:  http://www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/park.christina.html  I've always been attracted to smart, sophisticated women who dress well, and not necessarily sheer/slutty.  I guess that reflects my conservative upbringing and beliefs.  After going to Berkeley, I've come to realize that what I'm really looking for in a woman is not just looks, though to be honest, that IS the first thing I see.    I'm no prize myself, I understand that.  But I also pride myself that I'm not shallow.  I know what I want... two issues is to make myself something worthy, and the other thing is to find that person =P

      I have taken up, yes, another hobby.  I write articles on Magic The Gathering, and submit them to Star City Games.  Every now and then, one gets published.  Keeps me honest on my writing skills somewhat.  So I'm supposed to set up a road trip soon.  I have to go on several inspections in a far away area, and was hoping that things would work themselves out, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  I have several things I was hoping I could do, including seeing a friend off.  One of my coworkers is changing jobs and I wanted to see them off.    Sigh... even in the short span of a year, times are changing.

      Current Media:  Information High  by Sharon Apple (Gabriela Robin from the Macross Plus Soundtrack)   Saw the Ring yesterday.  HOLY MOTHER OF BLAZING COTTON CATS that movie is creepy.  BLOODY HELL.  And I'm going to leave it at that... don't want to spoil anything for anyone.  I'm considering getting the original Japanese film (advertised as Ringu, but I can't believe they used the romanji word as the movie title.  Why not bloody just call it the Ring as well?  Then put some subtitle on it?  Though I AM curious how the original was, and what differences there are between the two.  Work is back to normal for now... I completed an assignment that involved waking up at an ungodly hour, if I got to sleep at all.  I'm beginning to realize that I can't keep up this schedule forever.  What I need to do now is to get my ass back into a regular sleep cycle, and work from there.  Sigh.  Anyway, another year is coming up... my god, I'm getting to... that age...  I took the MCAT several years ago, and got average/slightly better than average scores on the science exams, but I rocked the verbal portion and the Essay portion.  That really made me start to wonder about where I was going in life.    I realize that this is technically the time of my life.  I really do need to get out there and start enjoying it.  But at the same time, this is me.  I don't LIKE going out there... I like taking life slowly, one day at a time, and just relaxing.  This is going to sound stupid, but I'm also realizing that there's more that I need to be doing with my life.  Is it more education?  Is it job dissatisfaction?  I don't know what it is.  Every time I drive by Hayward, I remember the first time I took the MCATs.  I remember how genuinely scared I was, since all through my school life, I knew two things:  I loved science, and I wanted to go to Medical School.  I'm living one but failed so far at the other.  I realize that I wanted to do it more out of a sense of accomplishment than I thought.  Don't get me wrong, to do the right thing and try to make people's lives better is something I am still interested in doing, and in a sense, that's what I'm doing now.  But it's not as direct.    I'm still not sure where I want to go, but what I do know is this:  right now, I have a great job, good friends, a loving family... There's nothing more I could want right now that isn't about plain materialism.  I know that God has blessed me, consdinering what I have.  All I know now is that If I keep working hard, if I keep moving and not stagnate, then life will evolve into what I need it to be.

      Well, more world news...  Warning-- what I'm about to say refers specifically to Kim Jong Il and his supporters of policy... the ones who think that what he's doing is justified is right, not the Korean populace in general.  I think Kim Jong Il is being an asshole and idiot.  This guy is using threats to get something.  I don't know what it is, maybe he really thinks he can use Nuclear Weapons to rule the world or something.  What he's doing is making everything worse for himself and the world.  Personally, I think that after the US wipes its collective ass with the tissue paper that is Saddam Hussein's face, we should flush the toilet, have some beans and work on North Korea.  The South has been doing pretty well, given that they only have half the country.  I say we oust the damn schmucks, and let the Southern government take over.  Dammit... when they bomb the smack out of these idiots, I want to personally smack the guy.  What he's doing is putting us all in danger, including his own people.  Why must the world be like this?

      Well, it's nice to see Clark finally be able to cut loose and actually do his thing.  The problem with pacifism is that "Evil triumphs when good men do nothing."  I know it's just fantasy, but the appeal of comic books, cartoons and fantasy shows is that justice is done, and the bad guys don't get away.  It's not our place to make judgements, but that is God's privilege.  To say that does not mean that we must do nothing, but still, as much as the laws of man are right, then evil needs to be punished.

      Any of you watch Smallville tonight?  THAT'S why we should pretty much exterminate frat boys.  Any questions?  I didn't think so.  Actually, let me make a clarification.  That's why we should pretty much exterminate any idiot that doesn't understand the concepts of morality, social order, and control for good reason.  Fraternities encourage such behavior, and 1) should be abolished, 2) their members truly audited for their behavior, and 3) responsibility taken.  Final note...  GO LEX!

      Well, I guess a direct questioning wasn't necessary.    My big issue is that I worry a lot about small things.  In fact, about everything.  Combine that concern with (not to toot my own horn) my planning abilities and (sometimes active) foresight, and of course, my vivid imagination, some of the simpler explanations just slip by me.  For instance, in the recent case, I forget that I'm not as close to some people as I am to others.  And not everyone treats people the same way I do.    See, the way I treat someone is, in a bit of a geek tribute, a little bit like a video game.  Everyone starts with a full health meter, and everyone takes a hit every now and then in my eyes.  If you take too many hits, there's no way I'm going to trust you.  You eventually regain your health, but it's a slow process.  On a side note, I just saw the commercial for 50 cent's new video DVD.  What is it about these rappers that makes them think they can do anything?  Okay, given the bill of rights, they can do anything.  But what makes them think they can do it well?  If you've seen the video, the quality is horrible.  Resolution, graphics, colors, rendering, shading, framerate...  everything was a basic, worthless and obsolete tribute to his vanity.  If people want to act like thugs and criminals so much, they deserve to be treated like criminals.  If you want to look like a duck, walk like a duck, talk like a duck then by all means, the world should roast you like a duck.  And since it's your choice, you shouldn't complain.  People!  Do unto others as you would have others do to you.  Your actions are reflective of you.

      We had a couple of Going Away parties for my friend who's quitting to go elsewhere.  Tonight was great, I had a lot of fun, but there's one thing nagging at me.  The evening started well enough, but I get the bad feeling that something I said or did upset one of my friends there-- I felt like I got the brush off as I left that night.  Little things like that bother me very much, since I don't think I did anything excessively wrong.  I may have been loud, etc, but at the same time, I always try to be considerate and mindful of others.  It bothers me to think that someone is angry at me for some unknown reason.  I plan to ask directly if there was something I did, but looking at this reaction tonight, I realized something.  I would wonder about things like this from time to time, thinking about what I could have done, and what might have happened.  For instance, tonight, what happened could have very well stemmed from the possibility that I am not one of the "beautiful people" and as such, do not exude the right "image."  Maybe that person doesn't like that, and simply doesn't like me around for that reason.  I've never been the most popular person, nor have I been the best looking.  I, however, like to think that the people around me are not that shallow.  If so, then so be it, I should then cease association lest I be sucked into that mentality.    But thinking back to college and a year or so after, I had the same doubts and insecurities.  In the end, taking that into account, the only one I can really count on is me.    I'd like to think that I've matured to the point that I can handle things like this.  To an extent, I can, as I am always willing and in fact favor to make a direct inquiry.  In this case, I'll just ask.  "Look, I'm wondering if there's anything I said or did yesterday to upset you or made you angry.  I felt that you were angry at me for some reason, or upset with me, and I would like to figure it out and see if there's anything I can do to make things right."  And if it is because I'm not one of the "beautiful people?"  Screw it.  I've got better things to do with my time.

      I'm watching Smallville, and if any of you are fans of the show, you'll know that Lex is currently hooked up with someone.  That someone (Helen, I believe) moved into the mansion recently.  Now she's making a huge fuss over a locked room that she can't get into.  So now she's demanding that lex tell her everything and let her in, etc etc.  Man!  This gal is pushy.  Granted that Lex Luthor does have a ... well... suspect history, but well, boy, it's just bad... Is that what a relationship has come to?  Even on TV the women are pushy and demand everything.  Weird stuff.

      I can't sleep tonight--  I've been particularly frustrated lately because I'm feeling really disconnected from my Asian blood right now.  I wanted to go see Spirited Away by Hayao Miyazaki.  No one's really interested at work.  I caught myself thinking-- geez, they just don't understand anything beyond what's fed to them in the mainstream.    I realized that it's not necessarily their fault.  My friends choose to keep themselves to the tried and true, nothing complicated, and I don't blame them.  What I do find disappointing and annoying is how some of them choose to continue their lives as it stands-- realizing that they've made mistakes, but doing nothing in terms of changing their attitudes to avoid making that same mistake.  Now, I'm not supposed to be the judge here, but man, people are dumb.  I'm back to my old self, which, I realize, is just fine.  I just need to focus on what's important to me.  I'm not saying that my friends are idiots-- oh, no!  I'm just reverting to my old "they asked for it"attitude.  Today at work, I received confirmation that I'm staying on, and pretty much praised to continue my good work.  That's great.  It's hard sometimes though, to get along with everyone when you have an attitude like mine... I tend to be holier than thou sometimes, and this is going to sound arrogant, but let's face it.  I'm usually right.  Now if only I can put that nicely.

      So I'm watching Dragnet on ABC.  They picked some VERY strange people to play the parts of Filipinos.  The name is off, the accent is off, the appearance... ALMOST on.  It's a small thing to nitpick, but oh well.  They had to pick an ethnicity, and we'll just see how this goes anyway.    Hey!  They got the language right!  It's a trippy thing to be able to understand the unsubtitled language, then hear them try to translate it.  There were some small details they left out.

      w00 h00!!! I made my probation!  Though I'm saddened to hear that it's official, one of my closest friends at work is going to be moving on to a different job.  I have mixed feelings-- I'll miss him but at the same time, he'll still be local, but the workplace will be very different.  Anyway, I'm still doing my things, writing Magic the Gathering articles, learning the guitar, having my fun.  In this time of war I hope you are all ok out there.

      Did y'all watch the last Dragnet episode?  The show episode is called "Redemption."  It was a great illustration of the Reid Interview/Interrogation technique.  Not much more to add to that.  Will comment more later.

      It's been a pretty mellow week.  I wish I got to do more team inspections-- it's a great way to get to know your coworkers.   I made a great dinner tonight for myself, light and zesty at the same time.  The writer's block is somewhat gone, and I got to write a bit before heading off to bed.  Tomorrow promises to be another light day, though it's a bit embarassing knowing that everyone knows that there's a cute waitress I want to get to know better nearby.  Ugh!  That's gonna be a harsh thing to do.  Especially since the last person I want to know about things like this knows... mainly because it establishes a bad record =P

      Caught an episode of America's Next Top Model.  Elyse is a total hottie.  She's got that smart sexy nerdy chic style.  She's a MED SCHOOL STUDENT!  They cut a hottie in the form and person of Katie.  But this show... despite the total amount of hottie-ness, it is very shallow and has even less substance than any other reality show, and that's saying something.

      Saw Black Sash for the first time today.  Yep.  Simple fight scenes and easy tricks schmucks like Ray J can do.  For the real complicated and flashy stuff, who do they call?  Yep, Asian extras that know the real stuff.  It's a crying shame that the only way Asians can get any screen time is to be either a hot chick on the arm of some white boy or be some sexless martial arts expert.    Aside from a few quality shows like Smallville and... Smallville, the WB is nothing but a shill of a network much like the UPN network.  Affirmative action for the brainless masses.    Any sort of publicity for Asian Americans is a good thing, but I can't stand how my people are displayed like this.

      So Ruben Studdard won American Idol.  I didn't watch it last season, but this time, with the oddities and the purpose of talent over image, I was really interested.    Clay and Ruben are neither the image that we see today, and yet, they may be more talented than any singer out there right now.  Congratulations to Ruben, and Clay has tremendous talent.  Clay is the more distinct of the two, and is certainly unique.  If they release a CD of his, I'll buy it.

      This past Saturday was my first opportunity to participate in judging a Magic: The Gathering event.  Specifically, the Scourge Prerelease.  For most of you, that means nothing, but the bottom line is that I had a lot of fun even though  I was working pretty much all day.  The two head judges, Conan and Don, were great and friendly.  A friend of mine played in my stead, seeing as I was staff and all.  I got a nifty t-shirt out of it, as well as some free stuff.  I also got a chance to trade.  It was, as I said, tons of fun.

      Okay, Michelle Rodriguez is officially a hottie.  I can't believe I forgot about her!   She looked okay in the trailers of Blue Crush, but has that total tough girl cuteness in Resident Evil.  Decent movie, really has that odd, strange feeling, but definitely engenders the feeling of claustrophobia and completely being surrounded and trapped in a way that only a few other movies to my experience have done.  Night of the Living Dead, for instance.  RE is a decent movie on its own, and has a few cheap thrills and shocks, but overall it's a decent tie in to the games.  A good basic horror movie.    Oh, I can't sleep, I have a critical test later.  Lovely, huh =P

      haven't been here for a while.  So I'm eating out one day and I hear this kid bawling his eyes out.  She's a baby, maybe 3 or 4.  She's crying hysterically, NEMO! NEMO!  And I think to myself, maybe the folks didn't let het see it.  She keeps crying, and after a while, my curiosity gets the best of me.  I look over, and to shock and hilarity, I realize what's going on... they served that table Steamed Rock Cod!!!!

      *Warning* not for the squeamish  It's about time.  http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/06/12/okinawa.rape/index.html  Now, don't get me wrong, I think that someone who is willing to lay their lives down to protect mine is certainly worthy of respect, but what we don't need is people who join for the wrong reasons-- the power, authority, control... The military needs to be the best, to have the elite.  And this guy.... this guy needs to be shot a couple of times.  Now, anyone who knows me knows that I'm very... apprehensive when it comes to Western perceptions of Asians in general.  My first gut instinct is that this little buttmonkey wanted some Asian luvin' and chose the worst way to do it.  Part of me wants to think that this was like an overdramatized situation like in the movies, but the rest of me knows that there are going to be bad apples.   Here's to hoping that America's armed forces represent the best of us.  The military shouldn't be a free job for the scum of the country.

      From my trip:  So, arriving at the hyatt, first things first.  I am PISSED off at the shuttle driver.  A few miles away from my destination, he turned around, went about 45 minutes out of the way before coming back and dropping me off.  I was angry, but you know what? Its okay, Ill deal with it.  It goes on.  This hotel, unlike others Ive been to, offers NOTHING.  No breakfast, not even the lame-o continental breakfast (a.k.a. old pastries, coffee and tea), no happy hour, no nothing.  Theyll charge you for just about every phone call you make, and to dial into my office internet will cost me a dollar.  SCREW THAT SHIT!  The Hyatt may be a nice looking hotel, but for pitys sake, theyre scrooges that will charge you for taking a piss in a different toilet(figuratively speaking).  Im complaining to the coordinator of the course, and hopefully this place never sees the agencys business again.  They can bite me twice.    Watching MSNBC.  Let me say right now that Lisa Ling = hottie.  Dammit, forgot my camera.

      Yknow, friendster is an interesting system-- it's probably one of the more successful networking sites out there, because it does this one thing very well, and that's display connections.  Ther's one little issue i have with the damn site though-- My friends are my friends, and in fact, most of my friends' friends are friends, but there are always going to be exceptions.    How is it that I end up being so attached to some people, but loathe others so blatantly?  I don't care if they read my profile on friendster or what not, but just seeing them or being reminded of them just irritates me.    Today was a very bad day-- I felt like crap, and being reminded of people who need to be slapped, or people who don't deserve what they have, or freakin' racist-anti-asian whitey lovin' (and that is not meant as a shot to the white boys, just to ... well ... my asian brothers undrstand) hos out there just didn't help.  Everyone calling me about stupid little shipments isn't helping either.  Ugh.  Another day is another issue.    I don't like to judge, but I hope all these people fall over into a puddle of mud.  Peace.

      You know, I love these Iraqi anti-americans.  I hope these morons understand what we freed them from, and what opportunities they have now.  Especially these shiite punks, who were oppressed by Saddam's Sunni muslim so-on-and-so-forth.  I would love to just see them sent back to wherever they belong, or for the US army to REALLY treat them badly.  These people don't deserve our help or aid, but we did it anyway, because it was the right thing (and that they have oil, and that it was Bushie's war...)  It's hard to not consider Muslims as all American haters, especially the way they treat us.  You know what?  They treat us the way we should be treating them, except that (and I'm about to get religious here) this just points to Christianity as the true religion...  Where was Allah to protect them?  How did the great American Satan, who brought them relief and freed them from oppresion, overwhelm them?  They should be glad, we're sending them to see their 72 virgins.  Xenophobic, racist, anti-everything bastards.  Yes, I know about the irony of that statement.    I'm sure there are good Muslims out there, just as there are good and bad Christians.   But Christianity, like most other religions out there, don't promote the persecution of their enemies and nonbelievers.  They don't promote the slavery of their women, etc.  It's hard to be a good person (not evena  good christian) when the belief system may have flaws.

      I want to share a funny little letter to the editor from the San Francisco Chronicle last valentine's day.  Edtor--I can't tell you how many times I've seen single women glumly shake their heads, saying, "There just aren't any good men in this town."  Of course, it's not just this city-- let's face it, a good man is hard to find anywhere you go.  But San Francisco really is different.  Sure, there are plenty of young, successful, handsome men here.  But a sizable number of them are gay.  So if you are a single, straight woman looking for a mate-- or just a date-- what are you to do?  You've already checked out the entire singles' scene, and there's nobody there for you.  Here's my question... when was the last time you went out with an Asian guy?  We're talking about a *HUGE* untapped source here.  According to the Milken Institute's analysis of Census Bureau data, Asian American women marry at twice the rate of their  male counterparts.  That means a ton of Asian-American bachelors are untaken, just waiting to be snapped up.  White women are not the only ones to pass up this promising opportunity.  After all, there are Asian women who do not date Asian men.  So I'm certainly not accusing anybody of racism.  But you don't have to look too hard to see that race clearly factors in.  Just look at the personal ads of people seeking a SWM-- single white male.  I've lived in parts of the country where women could afford to be race conscious.  In Chicago, Philedelphia, Providence and St. Loius, you could write off all Asian men and still declare open season on nearly all the guys around.    I'm not suggesting that the residents of these cities should limit their choice of soul mates based on race.  That's a bad idea.  My point is that you cannot afford to do that in San Francisco.  Nearly 1 in 3 men here can trace his ancestry to Asia.  And when you consider San Francisco's large gay community, ignoring Asian men would probably disqualify half the guys in the city.  You'd have to move to a less diverse part of the country for a clear shot at romance.  On the bright side, the cost of living would be much lower.  But seriously, you don't need to relocate to another city to win at the game of love.  There really are a lot of good men out there.  They just happen to be yellow.  *author's name omitted*

       urlLink My new favorite site.   Granted, some places, one sees hypersensitivity, but on most cases, this guy is just DEAD ON.  Some of Banzai was funny, but I found it pandering to Rednecks who see asians in such a limited manner.  Then I read about Jun on Big Brother.  Gebus!!!! Another one of those kinds of Asian girl.  Geez.  Men of other ethnicities, do us a favor, and help us real Asian folk breed that annoying genetic archetype out of our bloodlines.  Thanks!  By the way, before I get yelled at for that one, the archetype I'm talking about is the one that labels all asian guys as sexist, chauvanist, etc.  Totally stereotyping us, putting us in our place.  Lovely.  I love how it's okay for them but not anyone else.  Y'all can bite me.

      Warning:  explicit language.  Watching more Last Comic Standing... This one is kinda live, since the show isn't quite done yet.  All I've got to say is that Ralph is a big fat fuck.  Tess is a big fat fuck bitch.  I hope they both die.  Or at least lose.  They're funny, but they're still big fat fucks.  *post show update*  firstly, i feel bad dave mordahl lost.  He was really funny.  secondly, after hearing ralphie's comments, screw it.  I don't care if he's a fellow fatty, but I'm going to kick his ass if I ever see him.  What the hell is his problem?  What's the matter, you fat fuck?  Did we take too much from you?  BITE ME.  Then there's another elimination round?  FTS.  I don't know if they're really trying to get rid of the asian guy or what.    The question is posed again...  What did our people ever do to you?

      So the latest show I'm watching is Last Comic Standing, on NBC and Comedy Central.  I find that the stronger personalities stand out, and some of the comics are pushed to the background.  But hey, that's how it always happens.  What's strange is that there's an Asian guy on.  And he's pretty much disliked.  Why?  Because he keeps notes?  Because he's competitive?  They're plotting to eliminate him.  Because he's Asian?  WTF?    Now, these guys really seem like nice people.  These people are funny.  But what the hell?  America, wtf is wrong with you people?  What have we done to you?  Have we edged you out of that many jobs?  Have we kept you out of that many universities?  Have we robbed you of too many valedictorian positions?    Gebus.  I hope you guys enjoy, you buttmonkeys.   What did we ever do to you?  Anyway, there's this "coalition" of 5 comics that pretty much vote as a party.  They got rid of whoever they want, and then it's gonna go down to these 5 unless something goes awry.  I guess that's "democracy," but what this is now is unfair conspiracy.  It's really, REALLY annoying me.   It's not fair!  AUGH!  Okay, I'm also rooting for my fellow Asian.  I gotta back up the fellow fat boy, but he's coming up like an asshole.

      GT: "If you could say something to all the scammers of the internet world, what would it be?"  CB: "Die. You're the morons who make my life harder. Scammers, I hope you get cancer, spend thousands on chemotherapy, lose all of your hair, and become a social outcast. Then have the cancer go into remission for a year. After it's remission, spend additional thousands of dollars on more chemotherapy. Finally, after your final chemo session, I hope to see the cancer has been completely removed from your system - but when you step outside the clinic, I hope you get hit by a goddamn bus. In other words: Please die.   Truer words were never said, and I quote.  Thieves need to die.  Hiding behind some shield of anonymity, you all need to be castrated and die.

      Too much comedy.  So I'm out here in the Fort Bragg/Ukiah/Clearlake area.  It's beautiful out here, but god, I miss being around asian people, and I also miss being around a diverse environment.  I was walking down a Kmart to get some soda, and a small baby looks up at me and says "Hiiii!"  I smile and walk on, then I hear behind me, his dad says "don't waste your time, honey, he doesn't speak english"  I looked back to show him I understood, but decided to just let things slide.  Especially considering I'm outnumbered 1000 to 1 here.  You know what's nice about being in Hicksville?  Compared to these bloatbags, I'm thin.

      So my friend Dennis was kind enough to provide me some Gundam Seed to watch.  And there's a character in the anime named Frey.   Welp, she's definitley the kind of idiot schmuck girlfriend that people don't like.  It's actually quite amazing how easily the creators illustrate the fact that Frey is one of those idiots, and really makes the viewer hate her.    Now that's talent.  To anyone who can get their hands on it, I highly recommend watching it.

      There's a lot of Asian fun stuff in the media today...  First, there's the way they treated Dat Phan on last comic standing.  Whatever.  More power to the guy and congratulations for winning.  Just don't pull a Margaret Cho and get trapped in the "All-American Girl" schtick.  Then there's Banzai on Fox.  If they had As-Am writers and cast, and it was their idea, that would be fine with me.  But as it stands, it's a bunch of rednecks and racists blatantly shoving their prejudices on the world.  Then there's Lucy Liu's character in Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle.  White dad?  WTF?  Oh yeah, of course!  Cuz we all know Asian guys don't exist.  Fuck these morons who put that idea together.  They really need to learn to accept all of us, not just the women.  And lastly (and least recently) there's the Fast and the Furious movies.  How can you have an import car racing movie without Asians?  There's just no excuse.  Morons.  Keep in touch with issues of the blood on www.angryasianman.org.

      So Last Comic Standing is over...  Congratulations to Dat Phan!  I hope he gets some new material soon.  He's a great performer and a pretty funny guy, although, to be completely honest, I hope he works out more material.    Still gotta support the asian bro....  And, on a side note, SCREW YOU, TESS AND RALPHIE!!!  YOU BIG FAT FUCKS!!!! GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!  And with Tess at a pathetic 7%... I'm glad to see that either a) America doesn't vote based on racial lines, b) People genuinely found Dat Phan funny (which I do) or c) THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE BIG FAT RACIST FUCKS EVERYWHERE.  HAH!

You think everyone is plotting against you, and given the things you're doing, you wonder why?    It really sounds like you endorsed Hitler's brand of cleansing.  Then you guys send out bombers and stuff like that to fight your wars?  No one else in the history of this planet has committed atrocities in the range you guys do.  The christians are the only other possibility, but that was a large population represented by a small minority or a sick twisted leader.    You know what I see when I look in that direction?  The same thing.  The rest of you good Muslims should be running around with signs saying, "I swear to allah I don't know these people."    Kofi Annan should have walked out saying "Goddamn you mofos are crazy."  But the useless head of the UN tries to make political nice.  Screw them.

      Well, went to go see Carlos Mencia tonight.  Had a blast, with a few exceptions.  I have a confession to make.  I was wondering where carlos was the whole time, since there was not a segregated entrance for the stars.    When he got onstage, I realized that I had passed him by several times before.  He was dressed in a simple jacket  and jeans.  I thought he was just staff or some random guy, based on his appearance.  I was wrong.  I want to apologize to everyone I judge on appearance.    Just goes to show you that there's a lot to learn still.  Speaking of judging based on appearance, I apparently got stood up today by a friend of mine from college.  I don't know what happened, and I shouldn't speculate, because, me being me, I tend to extrapolate based on certain information and previous trends.  That made me quite irritated on the drive home, after all, I did lose out on 25 bucks to do this.  This is assuming I don't bring up the cost.  I don't care anymore... I'm upset, though there's not much I can do about it.

      Wow, how long has it been since I've been on here?  I guess I kind of started to neglect my blog because I'm not really sure who reads this thing.  It's just as well, I guess, since I see this more as a journal of my thoughts more than anything else.  This is my first Thanksgiving without my family, and had dinner at a friend's place instead.    It was a good meal, it was good company, I had a good time.  Things are different for me now, and as I race blindingly towards 30, I'm beginning to worry about where I'm going in life.   Time to have some fun, I guess.

      Okay.  Just saw Volcano High on MTV.  Let me get the bad stuff out of the way.  The plot was strange, the acting was a bit weird, and for pity's sake, leave our soundtracks and voices alone.  And at the very least, is it that so abhorrent for these people to get real asian voice casts and not the pathetic hip hop shiet?   Get your dirty fingers out of our culture.  But then again, that's what the asian kids want these days, and when all is said and done, they did an okay job, Snoop Dogg and all.  Congrats.  Now for the good stuff.  OH.  MY.  GOD.  THAT WAS OFF THE HIZZOOK!!!  It's been a while since I've seen a good martial arts movie in that flashy style.  It's nice to see asians portrayed by us, for us, not the crappy shit we see on TV.  Seriously, this is our own, and if we look like morons, it's our own damn fault.  This movie was just styyyyyyyyyyle, baby.  That's us in a nutshell.  So up yours, pop culture trying to typecast my people!  And would I be sick for saying that the female substitute teacher was a cutie? =)

      The Last Samurai.   Alright, all you real asians can stop gagging now.  Look, all, I hate to sound like one of those "our women" kind of chauvanist pigs, but let's face it.  This is yet another movie along the lines of Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas, among others, about a white man hooking it up with an exotic woman and culture.    This is nothing more than yet another fantasy film, in this case, with a fuckin' asian fetishist playwright who is a little too into the martial arts samurai fantasy.   Asian women are the new "hot alien star trek babe," that is to say, a conquest, a trick, like joining the mile high club.  Most of the time, men just see some asian women as attractive.  And as a fellow fan, I can't blame them.  In fact, it's good taste, IMO.  But seriously, others are just fetishists or worse, out for some exotic ass.  Consider the difference between The Transporter and say, Romeo Must Die, or Replacement Killers.  Asian men are still sexless martial artists, and I don't expect that to change overnight.  Asian women, however, just fawn over a white boy.  And don't think this is square on the shoulders of the white man.  There is many a sellout banana woman out there who's responsible for this.  Congratulations, you're now not a dragon lady, just a trophy girlfriend next to the mile-high club membership.  I hope you're glad.    Certainly, I understand that being in the old culture sometimes meant second class citizenship.  I know that some Asian guys are jerks and assholes and treat their women badly.  Well guess what, that's your fault for dating these losers and punks.    Look, people, part of my vitriol is as a result of past experience, but to be honest, I'm sick of this Asian exoticism shit.  Women, y'all are the most beautiful creatures on God's green Earth, and I recommend you stop letting people treat you like just another Geisha.  If you have any respect at all for the tradition and culture, don't go see the Last Samurai.    And if you really want to see it, at least don't pay full price for it.  And if you really want me to bow down in awe and respect, yell out "when is Ken Watanabe gonna hook up with the blonde with big knockers?!"

      Well, January is almost over, and it's almost once again *shudder* Valentine's Day.    For some, it's a day of happiness, an anniversary.  For others, a burden.  For me?  For me it's a strange mix of things, where societal expectations meet with my insecurities and boredom to form a strange result-- nonchalance.  After all, Valentine's day has no real significance in and of itself.  It's a day for lovers, and that's all fine and dandy.    This year, unless something drastic happens in the next 3 weeks, i'm just going to enjoy my singleness and kick back and relax.

      Outrage of the day:     urlLink Woolsey's leniency plea outrages victim   urlLink Teen victim rejects Woolsey's apology   urlLink LYNN WOOLSEY, RAPIST-LOVING FEMINIST   Now, first and foremost, I'm outraged not because the victim is asian, but this is all about the hypocrisy that makes the world a very frustrating place to live in.  This is extremely telling that there is still a lot of closet racism out there, and if I ever meet this Stewart Pearson on the street,  I'll be hard pressed to not smack him around a bit.  Second, Lynn Woolsey is an asshole, a liar and many other things for stepping in like this.  What the hell?  Ms. Phan, you have my full support on this, etc etc.  Yeah, I know, likely that she'll stumble onto this, right?  But you never know.  Anyway, a nice, relatively balanced forum on Asian stories and perception can be found at  urlLink Angryasianman.com .  Just goes to show you, on a side note-- democrats are not on our side either.  Quoting the Philly news:   "Lynn Woolsey, the Rapist's Rep. Liberal hypocrites in Marin County will probably forgive her. For Tina's sake, the rest of us should not. (E-mail the Rapist's Rep at  urlLink lynn.woolsey@mail.house.gov .)"  I'm not encouraging spamming here, but there's no harm in sending a rational letter expressing your feelings.  And not voting her back in.  If she does get voted back in, there goes any faith I had in Marin county.

      Last week, I caught the last episode of Cowboy Bebop.  I know it's an old series, but I just haven't really had the time to watch it.  Cowboy Bebop is going to be a classic, much like Akira is considered a classic by people who haven't really experienced anime.    Cowboy Bebop has an insanely enjoyable and fleshed out cast.  And without spoiling anything, I sometimes wish that Anime didn't always have an ending.  Anime, unlike american cartoon series, have a beginning and an end.  Characters get developed, and well, things happen.    I highly recommend the series to anyone who likes a good action packed show.  Animated or not, Cowboy Bebop is top notch by any measure.

      More fun from the world of student assho.... errr, athletes.  Colorado Univeristy has been under fire for some time as it's been raised that the football program has been using underhanded and downright unethical practices like sex parties and hiring escorts for its players.  Personally, I hope they all get an STD.  There have been accusations of rape and harassment and crudeness.  Am I shocked?  Not in the least.  Am I sympathetic to the victims?  Definitely.  I think that this is directly everyone's fault, because society as a whole supports these kinds of action, just like they support gangsta rap, etc.  It angers me to think that people are getting away with criminal actions just because of something they do.    Personally, I think it's time to change the penalty for sexual offenses to castration.  I personally hope that the players AND administratorsare punished to the full extent of the law.  If not for the cost both legally and practically, I want all these people to get life, or the Chair.  Extend the death penalty to rapists, child molesters, and other such crimes.  Oh, and Gavin Newsom is a criminal in my book.

      I was reading an article about the Dorm Fire in Seton Hall University.  For those who are not aware, a fire started in the dorms, three people died.  Two people are currently being tried for a felony, murder, I believe.  I don't recall exactly whether it was third or second degree.    Here's how it went down--   Two punk ass jocks (note that jocks doesn't necessarily mean someone who plays sports, but just non-geeks, nerds, dorks, or normal people-- in other words, anyone who thinks they're hot shit) are involved.  Big surprise.  One, as a joke, sets up one guy with a coed that's not quite hip, and the other gets pissed.  The RA gets in their face (again, these two idiots have a long term history of being assholes and disruptive) and breaks it up.  These two idiots allegedly (because it's still under investigation, though I'm certain they did it, they always do) set fire to a paper banner on a couch.  Does anyone know what it's like when those things get set on fire?  A couple of other guys apparently knew what happened but are keeping a wall of silence.  Thank god one of them wised up and took some responsibility for it.  The other three should be going down shortly.    Three people died.  Three people who didn't deserve it.  And it's all because these two assholes didn't like their RA, who was just doing the right thing, who was just doing his job, who was TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T HAPPEN.    I'm a little biased here, since I used to be an RA and have dealt with endless idiots of this scale.  I've witnessed stupid pranks like toilet papering, throwing a couch of a 5th floor balcony, entering the building while it's still closed from a fire alarm, and countless false fire alarms.  But the truth of the matter is that these stupid antics are just a matter of mindless pride and idiocy.  These people rebel against authority for no reason other than to try to be tough.  That kind of motivation usually leads to stupid, but not lethal results, which is why no lesson is ever learned.  Worse yet, that kind of behavior is often encouraged.  Long story short?  Authority needs to be obeyed for a reason.  Sometimes, the world needs its decisions made for it, because what's right is not always popular, and what's popular is not always right.  I, and everyone else in the world needs to be right, and should prefer to be right.

      One thing I've recently (i.e. within the last 5 years) realized is that I used to live my life, and still do but to a lesser extent, in a state of competition.  How am I doing compared to the rest of the world?  I still do that, as I said, to a lesser extent.  I worry how some peopel do compared to me, mainly because I generally think that yes, I AM better than some people.  That I've worked hard and done my share of suffering also factors into the question.  But the truth of the matter is this--  I am who I am, and that's all that's important.   So what if I'm not the golden boy at work, or if I'm not rich, or if person X is doing better than me?  I am who I am, and I'm pretty happy with that.   Positive message for the day =P

I've said it before, and I'll say it again-- these people are ingrates.  George W. Bush did them a huge goddamn favor and now they're bitching again!  It never ends!  I'll say this right now-- the problem is that these people, all they understand is might makes right.  And if they're not right, then everyone else is wrong and they will die for their cause, most likely by blowing themselves up.  Let's pick out some choice quotes, shall we?  "We don't trust the United States and the United Nations is a toy in its hands"   Okay, buddy.  In all honesty, there is good reason to be wary of people who exert undue control.  Ever thought about questioning your religious leaders?  And helloooooo, the UN has been opposing us all this time.  What kind of news do they get over there?  Freakin' Highlights for Children?  "If a government is formed without elections, then it will bring about violent opposition, as it would be illegitimate," he said. "Only elections will bring security."   No, only careful thought and planning will bring about security.  A government formed without elecctions can do the right thing if the people chosen to do it are honest and hardworking.  So far, the track record for that region isn't that great.  These people are upset because they can't choose a dictator, instead of a benevolent government being in place.  They would rather choose to shoot themselves in the collective foot rather than wait a little bit for a nice comfy shoe.  "Sistani has refused to meet any U.S. officials and has not left his modest two-story house in Najaf in years.   Shi'ites are obliged to follow the guidance of a top cleric -- "a source of emulation" -- on everything from spiritual to domestic affairs. Sistani issues edicts through intermediaries. "  Hello, mindless following!  Idiots, religious zealots with no mind of their own.  A civilization of children.  "America lets its own people have elections, but doesn't allow Islamic states to give this freedom to their own people," said Abbas Musawi, a bookstore owner.   Hey, moron, the last time an Islamic state came into power, they harbored a guy who killed thousands of our people.  Can you guess why we'd rather not see another one?  Fucker.  "Like many, he doubted Washington had Iraq's best interests at heart. "It's impossible America will put in a leader who represents the Iraqi people," he said. "He will be someone who works for U.S. interests like all the other rulers in the Arab world." "  Why are these people so set that the two (US interest and Arab interest) are mutually exclusive?  And since when was the rest of the Arab world with us?  In fact, that entire region is the only obstacle left to world peace, aside from some russian rebels and african uprisings, and perhaps south american drug trafficking?  The big problem here is that the entire fucking middle east doesn't understand the entire concept of true democracy, that is, not only is it majority rule, but also the rights of the minority.  Islam is the MOST 'if you're not with us' religion in the world, and when an entire region is steeped in that kind of isolated zealotry, most of the nuts will come to the fore.  Everyone else in the world has progressed to the point that there has been some sort of religious reform, but these morons are still stuck in the fucking 10th century or before.    Not to make light of the issue, but when even asian folks treat their women better than you, you've got some serious issues, habib.  So all you ingrates in Iraq can STFU and be glad I'm not the president.  And now to apologize.   I certainly don't think that all arabs are american hating idiots, but gebus, your countrymen make it really hard.  And when they fuck up, all I hear is, don't blame them, it's not their fault.  How about some fucking solidarity?

      I'm not trying to compete with  urlLink http://www.angryasianman.com  but just a few blurbs--  Kaila Yu has a plug for her new CD in this month's FHM.  Ladies, don't get me wrong, I get the magazine free from the net (ain't it great?).  I'm torn.  She's definitely cute, if a bit slutty (she's known more for her nudie pics, i.e. she's an import model than her voice).  But she's Asian.  Do I support her because she's Asian?  Or do I not because that's something I normally wouldn't support anyway? (I dobut she's got a good voice)  The hometown honey is apparently asian, on a side note.  Jet Li is interviewed for his new game.  Jeanette Lee, the black widow of pool is also featured.  What is this, Asian month?  I know I touch on this a lot, but I'm seriously worried about how we're portrayed in the media.  Oh well.  Something to think about.

      Okay.  First things first.   urlLink Will Hung has his CD.   Laugh if you will, but I'm SEVERELY tempted to buy the CD.  First and foremost, it's funny in an embarassing sense. Second, the guy's of the blood. Third, screw you stereotypical fucks laughing at the chinaman.  One thing being of the blood bestows upon me is the ability to easily cut past Hung's accent.  I hear Will perfectly.  I hear the accent, and yes, there is some humor in his engrish.  But to me, it's just not that funny.  There's some comedy value, but I'm not some redneck hick going 'hyuk hyuk, lookit the funny chah-na-man!' and laughing my inbred ass off.  He's one of US, goddammit.    But not to isolate the non-asian folks out there-- Will is just doing what he wants to do.  He's succeeding.  Not good looks, not talent, but just a lightness and air, not to mention a bit of naiveté that endears him to quite a few people.  He works hard, he studies hard, and he has a decent set of priorities.  I'm willing to support that.  On that note, no, I'm not buying Kaila Yu's CD (until I know for sure she's not an Asian J.Lo wannabe who went through the nudie path), and I'm considering buying Jin's CD, torn between my hatred of everything 'urban' and enjoyment of the Original Chinky-Eyed MC.

      Turns out that the shirt was part of a clothing line.  No big.   I'd still feel a little weird seeing a non-asian wearing it...  Anyhoo, lately I've been feeling unsure of myself, since life comes now in one flavor-- work.  I've been working pretty hard, but I still somehow feel slightly insecure.  I'm a little lost and confused, where I should be more confident in my own abilities.  I've been working at the agency for almost two years now, and I consider myself to be capable of taking on 'leadership' responsibilities.  But still, something's nagging at me, causing me to doubt myself and everything I do.  Oh well.  I guess just a little longer...  One of the things I've resolved to do is improve my sleep schedule.  I want to be in and out of bed at a normal hour-- when I was on the road, I was in and out at an early, normal time.  And I felt really great.  So far, I feel more energized, I feel like running around more, etc.  I've been happier overall, especially since I've started looking at the brighter side of things.  I've become a lot more aware of my own weaknesses and strengths, and have come to terms with my mildly despotic tendencies.   With that in mind, I've been slowly letting go of the things I can't control, and learning to place myself in such a situation that I can control as much of my life as I can.  I was at costco today, debating if I should  have popped $16 for software to teach me play the guitar.  The big issue is sitting down and actually playing it.  I pick information up quickly enough, and memorizing chords is something I can do if I set my mind to it.  I imagine learning to play the guitar will help me become a more well-rounded person.  Que sera, no?

       urlLink More clothing snafus   I can't tell if that's innocent, or if I should be offended.  After talking about it with a friend, I decided that hell, yes, I should be offended!  I mean, let's face it, I love Asian women, but this.... this is a bit awkward.    Initially, I thought that it was a bad thing that they didn't use an Asian woman for the shirt pic, but after thinking more about it, it was probably the smartest thing they did.  Anyway, enough of that.    How bored am I? I've got nothing to do, so I was tempted to IM someone I really shouldn't. (No, it's not who you think it is, most likely)  Anyone who knows me will tell you that I've got a severe pride problem.  Most of the time, it stays in check, but one of the things that annoys me more than anything is being  told   what to think, especially when I'm right.  The thing is, I'm going to have to let go of it, because the offending party has no idea, no feeling that they're wrong.  So it's either I crack, give up my pride, and apologize for being 'offended' or just let it be and just cut my losses.    Anyway, that's my stupid little story.

      Finally home!  It's nice to have all my freakin' creature comforts back.  The cable modem being the biggest of them all.  Granted that I'll miss the king size bed, pool, ocean view and the daily cleanings, but home is home!!!!  So glad.   Anyway,  I came from Fort Bragg for business, and the nice thing about travel is that one always comes back with a renewed, fresh perspective on where I live.  On a side note, apparently, there's a cute asian girl living in my apartment complex. =)  Gotta meet her. =)  Going on about travel and coming home,  one thing about the bay area is the immense amount of Asians here.  Not only Asians, but all other ethnic groups as well.  Don't get me wrong, people were great in Fort Bragg-- down to earth and mellow people.  But the truth of the matter is, I know I look different from the rest of the world sometimes.  It's kind of a security blanket for me to just fade into the background sometimes.    But not only that-- it reminds me that the world outside popular media is very different.  What's funny is that as an Asian male, it didn't matter over there-- I was just another guy.  On the other hand, in a larger society, I'm the image of what's reflected in the media and years of social bias.  It's getting late, and I'm rambling... *shudder*  just got reminded of this horrible, horrible banana I used to know.

      Panic Room is an idiotic movie for several reasons.  For one thing, the idea is completely and utterly idiotic.  Don't get me wrong-- crime is never a idiotic thing-- it's always wrong and evil.  But a movie based around some rich people's problems doesn't exactly engender sympathy.    It's been said before.  Panic Room?  Who has a panic room?  Moreover, the concept is ridiculous!  It's a run of the mill robbery with an interesting twist =P    There's another point--  Yu Gi Oh.  It's one thing to make an anime out of a card game.  But it's another thing to make an anime out of a card game.  Anyone who plays card games knows that multiples of a card increases the chances of drawing the card you need.  Moreover, if a card is so important, then you should pack as many as possible.    Anyway, long story short, the comic makes no sense.  It's a card game.  Even us magic players have no delusions that it's just a card game.  Sure, sometimes we get into the role of things, but we never go that deep into it =P  Geeks versus geeks... it's not right.

      One of the biggest character flaws I have is, quite simply, when I'm right about something, I can get pretty obnoxious, especially when the contrary party insists on not listening to the right course of action, which, coincidentally, is mine.    Now, I may think I'm right, I may actually be right, and, as bad as it sounds, I usually AM right.  I wish that people (myself included) would be able to see past their own delusions.  I want to make something clear-- I'm not perfect.  I don't know everything.  However, I do know that specific events and happenings can lead to a much larger trend, and I know that birds of a feather flock together.  More appropriately, people fall into categories.  I can read people somewhat well.  For pity's sake, piecing together items and events to come up with a complete report is my job!  Oh well.  Enough ranting.

      Two more days then I get to go home.    Working on the road has been exceptionally interesting, since being out of my comfort zone helps me grow as a person.  Never let it be said though...  I love my creature comforts.  I love that life has given me what I need and that I'm finally in place to have my fun.  I miss it all.  I hate travelling.    I'll be glad to go home.

      I'm watching TV today, and I've seen the funniest thing--  As some of you know, the World Wrestling Federation had to change their name to World Wrestling Entertainmnet, because the World Wildlife Fund won a lawsuit.  Today, they're showing the 10 greatest wrestlemania matches of all time.  They blurred the old WWF logo!  That's comedy.  The truth of the matter is this-- the WWF, world wrestling federation that is, will always be associated with WWF, and though I think it's the right thing to do to abide by the outcome of that case, that a company censors itself is comedy.  A partnership would have made more sense.    Oh well.

      One of my biggest problems is that I think too much of people-- that is to say, I put up too much trust in them.  I believe that people can change, I believe that people essentially want to be better.  When you invite someone out, not even necessarily on a date, but just to an outing, what are the most annoying questions one could possibly get in return?  Who's going?  Why?  What's in it for me?  When someone tells me, hey, I'm having an event or there's an event, I immediately decide--given what the event will be, and given that I know the person who's hosting or inviting, there are two simple questions on my mind-- 1, can I make it, and 2, is it something I would go to?  If the answer to the above questions are both yes, then I'm going.  That's all that counts, I'm not gonna be a spoiled brat and pick and choose.

      Well, here I am in Fort Bragg, sitting around, doing nothing, wasting time, writing reports.  God, I want to go home.  I want to meet some friends.  I guess the more interesting thing is that I had some... misconceptions about my travel this weekend.  I was under the impression (after an initial confirmation with my supervisor) that I would get paid overtime for my travel over the weekend.  I wasted my entire Sunday, and in the end, I was told that I would not get paid overtime, and just get credit hours instead.  Well, guess what, I don't WANT that time off, I WANT MONEY.  Shit, the problem now is that I'm concerned... what's the likelihood that my boss deceived me on purpose?  Did she tell me that I would get overtime pay to encourage my weekend travel?  God, this is getting frustrated.

      One thing a lot of people know about me is that I'm kind of touchy about the whole matter of how Asian men are perceived by the general public, and most importantly, by our own kind.    A discussion with a friend of mine pretty much set the terms.  The truth of the matter is that other races will do what they do.  If it's an asian fetish, who am I to argue?  Asian women are quite frankly, in my opinion, the most beautiful women in the world, and who am I to blame someone else for agreeing?  Granted that a fetish isn't healthy, but at least it's a physical attraction.  My problem comes with the too-frequent exoticization of Asian women.  Full Metal Jacket should be the most hated movie by Asians ever, reducing Asian women to a sexual stereotype.  Live it up, ladies!  That's what most of the folks out there think of you.  Anyway.  The truth of the matter is that we're a minority.  No matter how 'successful' we may be, and no matter how 'accepted' we may seem to be, we're still outsiders in this country.  See William Hung for a great example.  Solidarity is what we need here, fellas.    The whole reason this came up was that discussion.  Everyone knows of the SAF/SWM thing.  And a few of my friends and I have been talking recently.    First lesson about Asian race relations-- some Asian women see men as sexist, chauvanist, and downright abusive.  Tragically, that's the case when the previous upbringing is in a sexist, abusive, male-oriented society.  But that's no excuse for characterizing an entire race in that light.  That's called racism, boys and girls.  It's like characterizing all Africans as tribal savages, all white men as white supremacist nazis, etc etc etc.  How can any Asian woman live with themselves, judging an entire race by one narrow generalization?  Well, live with themselves is a bit harsh.  Put differently, how can they claim to be fair?  Simple answer:  they can't.    It's called by one simple name-- self hatred.   Every person needs to accept the tragic history involved with every culture, and learn to surpass it.   People who refuse to let it go... well... you may as well get blue contacts, dye your hair blonde, and call yourself Alex's bitch.  Oops, sorry.    A bit of old college anger coming up.   Long story short.  Asian guys, learn your history.  Change yourselves and don't repeat the mistakes of the past.  Asian women, learn your history.  Don't let yourselves become victims again, but don't become someone else's victim.  That's all.  *EDIT*  one last thing.    My biggest failing as a Catholic is that I don't forgive very easily.  So if my little tirade happens to be read by said bitch and said bitch's little bastard, come on by.  I won't say anything, since talk is cheap.  Just bring it.

      Well, here's another two weeks down the drain.  My mom got into a car accident recently.  I saw a picture of the wreck.  That said, it's amazing that my mom is as unhurt as she is.  Let this be a formal plug for Mercedes-- their cars are safe.  Long story short, some idiot was speeding, and hit her head on.    She's here, staying with my brother for a while, while she recovers from her (relatively minor, but still significant) injuries.    I want to implore with everyone out there... please, drive carefully.  If you're rounding a curve, SLOW. THE. FUCK. DOWN.  Take care in how you drive.  As the old saying goes, the life you save may be your own.

       urlLink More Greek System Idiocy.   Proving all around that idiocy is not a monopoly by men.    I may not be an expert on the matter, but as someone that works in that field (that is, Food and Drug/Device safety, etc, as well as being a scientist by training), these idiots put huge numbers of people at risk by donating potentially tainted blood.  It should be known that the Red Cross does not have the best safety record in terms of quality control (look it up), and the fact that fraud occurs on both sides makes me shudder.  Yet more incentive to abolish the greek system altogether.  All it is now is a simplistic, less- prestigious, country club system that lets in any idiot who passes their (quite absurd) social criteria.

      After 4 years out of college, I learned something.  Following one's dreams is difficult.  After futile attempts to get into med school, I felt like crap, and that my life wasn't going anywhere, but I also realized that my life is going in a different direction now.  I don't regret my choices up to this point, and there have been a few critical junctions.  One thing I did understand throughout that time, however, is that whenever I had a concrete plan, I should never settle for something less.  In other words, I didn't take a filing job at a doctor's office in an attempt to get closer to the medical field.    To settle for a tangental point is a rather unwise decision overall.  The best way to go about things is to try for what you want, then, and ONLY then, if one does not succeed, to go the alternate route.  There's more reasoning to that, but I don't think that's something most folks want to hear.  My advice?  Take your time.  Put everything together.  Do it right.

      So work is getting extremely irritating.  This is, I think, the 8th day in 10 that i've had to stay later than i'd liked.  But things could be worse.  I'm learning quite a bit and I'm glad to be able to improve my skillset.  As it goes, a few folks have been calling here and there to see if I'm interested in a position elsewhere.  That begs the question, should I do it?  Private industry means more work, less stability, more stress, and more pay.  But right now, I'm getting precious experience that I may not be able to elsewhere.  I think I'm going to stay.

They're a breeding ground for intolerance, idiocy, drug use, alcoholism, sexual assault, hazing, etc etc etc etc.  Seriously, there's no point in the system except to generate a class of haves and have nots, a place for people to buy friends and use a 'privileged' network system that seldom works.  It's mob mentality at best, societal chaos at worst.    But this is America, and people are free to do what they wish.  I should start an organization.  "Not drunk, Not idiots."  It's the perfect antithesis.

      I gotta be honest.  I'm not all that into Asian Heritage-- all I know is the here and now, along with just a tinge of how it used to work back in the day.    Nonetheless, it's Asian Pacific Islander Heritage month.  Time to make the rest of the world aware of Asian History and identity. Men, you're not sexless martial artists with a fumanchu mustache.  Ladies, you're not passive, exotic sexual objects.  Get out there and spread the word!

      So I got a new webcam, among other things.  I've got to clean up my apartment, so no one will see just how messy this place is!  This weekend, I drove down to LA with my brother to take care of some junk, and I'm back.   I'm so glad I moved, since southern California just got so bad.  The smog is so much worse than I remember, and the area has just exploded!  There are so many people down there, it's ridiculous.  As property and homes become more and more expensive, people move out further and further.    I was at a wholesale warehouse store's gas station when this lady pulls in the wrong way, because she obviously couldn't be bothered to follow the guide cones, so she cuts in from the exit.  A gas station attendant approaches her and politely asks her to please turn around.  Not leave, just turn around.  This woman snaps back, 'no, i'm not going to turn around.  I'm going to pump my gas, and you shouldn't have put those cones, I couldn't get in.'    The attendant tells her politely that she can't pump gas, and she just tells him off, 'I'll do whatever I damn want.'  The station attendant says okay, moves off, and shuts off the pump.  At this point, we were leaving, so I couldnt' stick around to see how it turned out.  This just infuriated me to no end, seeing this rude, classless woman just mistreat this poor guy who was just doing his job!  Crude, rude, idiotic, brusque...  Ugh.  I mean, really.  It wasn't such a hard thing.  But this woman had to have everything her way.  What a brat.    I think next time, I'm going to stand up for the right thing and actually say something instead of letting idiocy like this slide.  That's my great regret.  Anyway, it's late, I have to work tomorrow, and I still have to shower before I head to bed.  Gnite!

      A few minor addendums to my DC trip:  I found a great little hole-in-the-wall sushi place that has a bit of a limited selection, but each order of nigiri or maki had huge amounts of fish/etc.  I had a few orders of unagi (that's eel for you non-sushi eating blasphemers =D) and the pieces were simply huge!  Moreover, they were grilled to be really crispy.  The sauce they used was fantastic, and I'm definitely going back there again.  For the curious, it was called Sushi Sushi, and it's in Bethesda somewhere, near the Ben and Jerry's.  As it goes, things are getting busy at work, because some of the work got backlogged.  It turns out that I'm not getting any time for flying back on friday, but that's fine.  At least I still got half a day off.    I think back on the trip quite fondly, since whenever I go to training, I get to meet new people and see and learn more about the agency at large.  This weekend is going to be a great time to relax and finally clean out my bachelor pad.  Now to find someone to take back to it =P    What's the point of a really chill apartment if you've got no one to show it off to? =)  But then again, I think about it, the aparmtent is quite average, and hopefully I can move to a more... fun place.  Anyway, enough griping.  My curry's on the stove =P

      The last of the trilogy is as follows!  Thursday, the last day.  Of course, this starts at about midnight, just after Wednesday!  I finally relax a bit from the test, since I've put myself under so much artificial pressure to excel at this test.  Then, something my friend told me rings back into my head, and I realize that it's not about a score on the test, but how well I know the law, rules, and regulations, and that's something an open book test can never teach me.  I'm quite confident in my abilities, so I go to sleep relaxed, and mellow, with only the challenge of getting to know that gal a little more before the class is over.  Classtime comes and so does the test.  Surprisingly, I take a lot longer than I thought.  This was a real exam!!!  Fortunately for me, I was paying attention in class and caught quite a bit of it.  The problem was that because of the day of mourning the boss assigned, we had to cut classes short, and the arrangement meant that labs would be after the exams, and the labs were quite critical to the test.  Some difficulty ensued, but I did okay.  The rest of the class was mellow, with some fun with lab supplies, measurement instruments, and dangerous chemicals.  Mwa hahahaha!  After class, I and quite a few folks head out to Outback to celebrate the last of the night.  Including the gal =)  And those guys from the midwest and the south.  Lots of fun, good food.    After that, a couple of us met with a few other folks from the class at Adams Morgan, a district filled with bars, clubs, etc.  We had fun, had a drink here and there, and just plain relaxed.    After all that, the climax of the story is...  Nothing happened.  I got back close to 2 am, and ended up staying up all night packing.  The shuttle company was a bunch of pricks, and if you can avoid it, never go super shuttle.  Sadly, they seem to have a monopoly.  Ugh.  Just be warned that on heavy business days, they WILL screw you so book waaaaaay in advance.    I sleep through just about everything, including the flight, and thanks go out to my coworkers and friends Dave and Nicole, who were kind enough to give me a ride back to my place.     The week was not that bad, with many new friends, great food, and a lot of fun.  I'm glad to have gotten to go.  Oh, and that person I thought I'd be at odds with?  I should give people more of a chance.  Seeing as it's only been a 4 day trip, I shouldn't judge so harshly.  All's well that ends well.

      Part two of my odyssey begins... here!  I realize that southern and midwestern folks are just plain mellow, much more relaxed, and it just reinforces my belief that a simple, uncomplicated life is the best way to go.  Leslie and James, two new friends from North Carolina, now in different parts of the country, were two fun guys who were completely mellow.  Honest, hardworking, old fashioned guys.    Anyway, Tuesday night sets in and another quite sleepless night ensues, as I realize I can't sleep.  I give a friend of mine a call, and just realize how different that gal (the nice one) I met is from the people I know here, and it's a shame that I wouldn't have more time to spend around her.  Some women can be so self centered... but I digress.  After a conversation with someone yacking about themselves for so long, I'm finally ready for bed.    I wake up on Wednesday *almost* energized, since I'm always pumped to hang out with cool people.  The class is interesting this time, with quite a bit of pressure on with the test coming first thing the next day.  It goes by with me struggling to just stay awake, since last night left me quite tired.  At the end of the day, I met up with James, one of my local colleages, and a new friend from a different district for dinner at Houstons, a quite nice steakhouse that in retrospect cost a little more than I'd liked, but it was in good company.  And if anyone says otherwise, I'm telling you right now, I was just trying to be nice.  Anyone who knows me knows that the waitress wasn't my type =)    Thursday was quite the adventure, so I'll go into that in my next post!

      Well, I'm back from Washington DC!  I've gotten a chance to get back on my feet and settle down to relax, so this one's gonna be a while.  Grab some popcorn, and take it all in!  I arrive at the airport on Sunday morning, about an hour before my flight.  I hit the express check-in since I have no luggage (Man, express check-in is one of my favorite recent innovations.  I mean, stick your card in, and you get a boarding pass!  And they're so labor-unintensive, the airlines can put in so many of them.  They're super quick.), and dash straight away to the security line...  WHICH WINDS ALL THROUGH THE TERMINAL.  I really don't like the TSA.  I know security measures are there for a reason, but seriously, they're slow, inefficient, and don't give half a rat's ass most of the time.  I know that there are good people, but it's hard to find.    Anyway, after wasting all that time, I have to be rushed to the front because even the airport people knew that the TSA would make me miss my flight.  I get there and meet up with two of my coworkers, and we're off to a 6 hour flight of superfuntime happiness in a clogged plane.  We arrive, check in, and meet up for dinner.  We meet another colleague and have a great meal of mongolian BBQ... all you can eat!  That closes out a good night, but not before a trip to the grocery store introduces me to what I think is a great reason to move to DC ;)  But then I decide that I'm here on business, and shouldn't really do anything stupid.  For that matter, I'm not quite good enough to just step up and chat someone up.  I let it slide and head off to bed.   The first morning of classes was quite uneventful, at least until i meet up with someone familiar.  Yep, the gal I saw at the grocery store is actually one of my counterparts from another district!  Boy am I glad I didn't say anything stupid.  First lesson that didn't quite hold-- be careful of what you say, because it might come back to haunt you later.  Anyway, the first day is chockful of surprises, and I find out that the schedule has changed because of the Reagan Funeral Service.  In other words, the 5-day training would be compressed to 4.  No big, I've always worked well under pressure.  But it's the change of flight that may have given me problems.  I'm actually quite the social animal, and thrive on a good working community.  Dinner was an interesting affair, as we ended up getting split apart.  I have a drink or two with some friends at a local bar, and end up finding a nice little sushi place around the corner.  The night ends uneventfully.  I wake up on Tuesday ready to face another day of work, and try quite desperately to get to know that gal a little better, but the class... is... just... too... boring...  ugh.  It goes by and things wrap up.  I get to know another one of my collagues and realize that she's cut from the same cloth as one of my other coworkers-- vain, self interested, loud.  The thing is, she's smart and attractive, and knows how to use it to manipulate people.  I just am not drawn to such people, and I feel that I may end the week with another person of opposition.  Dinner today is mellow, as I am able to meet up with the good gal and a couple of folks to a little japanese place.    Part two tomorrow!

      Well,  urlLink it finally happened.   Now, aside from the previous link I posted, I really do wonder what's going on. I've seen pictures of the girl, and she's quite cute, but I wonder who's using who here? Is Alice Kim starstruck, a golddigger, naive, or what? Is Cage a fetishist, a Woody Allen wannabe, or what? I mean, a former waitress, and not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's just strange. Then again, I'm not completely innocent. I've chased my fair share of cute waitress =D  I must say that I can't blame Nic-- she's a babe, and men, we all know that we would if we could. But maybe it's cynicism, I really doubt if it's true love.  Let the stones fall where they may.  However, it's quite strange. Many Japanese are several generations removed from being fresh off the boat, as is the case with Chinese, but of all things, it really does seem that Filipino women and Korean women are the most frequent to... well, how do I put this? Not just marry outside of race, because there's nothing wrong with that, but they're the most frequently seen to sell out!  For those who don't know, selling out means to either forsake your own culture/history for 'a step up the social ladder' or to outright deny it. There are folks who've never been old school, that is, people who've never really been exposed to their homeland's culture, and no one's blaming them. No one's holding them at fault.  I guess that until I meet Mr. Cage and the new Mrs. Cage for myself, I can't really judge them. Those thoughts I just had have passed, and all I want for the couple now, regardless of their circumstances, is a successful and happy marriage. Congratulations, Nic!  Welcome to the blood ;)   urlLink Photos of Cage and Kim   Will someone please explain to me what Digital Chosunilbo is?  It seems to be Korean news, but its culture and opinion columns are quite strange.   urlLink A story about Cage and Kim's possible split  (old)  It's a little strange, as this place seems to emphasize the exotica of Korean culture not as a pride issue, but as a novelty.   From the notorious  urlLink What is it about Korean Men that Japanese Women Adore?  to today's thing (particularly the 'Poor Alice' thing, which does nothing to shed the sexist shading stereotypes of Asians) to a variety of strange stories, it's just a... different perspective, I guess.  It's almost like a gossip column given legitimacy.   For the curious, here's a  urlLink link .   And to show that it's not all negativity, here's  urlLink some love for the Korean man .

      Work today was a complete hassle.  First, for the first time in a while, I actually arrive early, and think that I might be able to earn some extra credit time. I start the day early, take care of just about everything I have to take care of (with one exception, since I couldn't quite remember the exact thing I was supposed to do with the assignment, but that's okay, since I did what I could otherwise), and make very good progress otherwise. There's only one catch though--  One of my coworkers needed a ride somewhere to pick up his car. Oi. To Hayward, which is about 1/2 hour away, each way.  I guess I can't really complain, I could have always said no. But I went, and that's that.  That's the thing. I mean, I've tried and tried and tried to dissociate myself from that, and yet, I'm so concerned about the surrounding circumstances that I have missed the point until after the fact-- I could have just said no. My mom would always tell me, that if I was going to do something, it would be best to just do it without complaining and whining all the way through. My brother taught me the same thing. And so did my trainer.  No matter the circumstance, no matter the method of conveyance, the lesson that doesn't seem to stick to me is 'Do it right, or don't do it.' I should have just said that I couldn't do it. Plain and simple.  From that motto, 'Do it right, or don't do it,' here are the lessons that I've missed.  1) Forgive. What's done is done, and if a person really is trying to make things right, then let them do whatever it is they do. If a firm is conducting recalls, and is doing its best to comply with federal regulations, there's no need to cram it down their throats that their product may have been dangerous or hazardous. It would be best to just help them along and help them to do it right. It goes twice as much with friends! Past grievances are just that, in the past, and people are who they are for a reason. Just as I am who I am, everyone is entitled to be who they are, and make the choices they do. Which leads us to...  2) Forgetting. Francis, a friend of mine, told me that I hold a grudge waaaaaaaay too long, or put differently, I need to let what's behind me go. I keep trying to change the world, but I'm the only person I need to worry about. I need to keep MYSELF on the right path, I need to keep MYSELF from doing wrong. No matter what I think, everyone else is entitled to do their own thing. God and other people will do the judging.  3) Making things right. Boy, is this a sticking point. Even my closest friends know that I'm one of those people who hates the way the world is, and rails against it every chance I get. The problem is, sometimes, that angst spills over. I feel that there is an 'ideal' world that we should all aspire to, and sometimes, I expect people to adhere to that sometimes impossible standard. It's not my job to make things right, but to do my part to make this world a better place.  Today, it all wrapped itself up nicely.  And I think that that was the last realization I needed to change my outlook on life.  Let it be.  Let it be. Whispered words of wisdom, Let it be.  =P

      Harold and Kumar opens today!&nbsp; Go see it, support Asian folks, and most of all, go see a funny funny FUNNY movie!  On the surface it's a stoner movie, but deep down it's got some solid laughs, and is actually quite smart!&nbsp;   Oh well, I've got a long day tomorrow and two hours of work to make up.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; Gnite, all!

      Just got back from Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, and I gotta say, it was great.&nbsp; Absolutely funny. The attendance for the event was... interesting. Mostly Asian and south Asian guys/gals, and a few white people too.&nbsp; They started letting us in at about7:00 pm, and by the time everyone was seated, the theater was almost completely packed.&nbsp; Almost, but not quite.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it was a good attendance.&nbsp;   The movie itself was hillarious, with a few gross-outjokes, but surprisingly not as many as I expected. The writing was quite good, and even then, the grossout moments are not that gratuitous.&nbsp; (Some of thenudity was though ;) )&nbsp; Mr. Penn and Mr. Cho did quite well, and theircharacters were fully developed, not just the 2-D characters in hell, most comedies!&nbsp; A little bit ofsuspension of disbelief is necessary, but the film is definitely full of solid laughs, and as all the hype stated, it was definitely without using the stereotypes.  That said, the movie does NOT portray white people kindly =D.&nbsp; It's not that all white people are bad, it's just that most of them (like the rest of the characters in the&nbsp;film) are just plain weird. &nbsp;I'm not getting all PC here, but this is definitely one of the standout points of the film. Ironically, the thing that will bring this movie the best success is the complete opposite of what broughtit to tha API community to begin with:&nbsp; This isn'tjust a comedy for Asian folk.&nbsp; It appeals to folks on every level, and like I said, there are real laughs throughout the film.&nbsp;   Go see it.&nbsp; It's definitely good for some laughs.

      Many people who know me realize that over-analysis is one of my flaws.&nbsp; It's like that part in the Princess Bride where Venicci (is that his name?&nbsp; The Sicillian, who the Dread Pirate Roberts engages in a battle of wits with) keeps going further and further into supposed assumptions.&nbsp;   Anyway, between that and watching numerous recent mystery shows (Dragnet, Detective Conan, etc) and my job of gathering information, I am constantly trying to figure things out that most other people would have dismissed a long time ago.&nbsp;   For instance-- is person X seeing someone or not?&nbsp; Long story short, I am constantly receiving mixed signals-- after all, a significant significant other would make an appearance at a large family event, right?&nbsp; Maybe, maybe not.&nbsp; There are too many gaps in the information I have.&nbsp;   Argh!!!! If anyone can help me drop this annoying habit, it'd be much appreciated!

      I hate losing.&nbsp;   Obvious, huh?&nbsp; I mean, there are times when it's quite expected to lose.&nbsp; Physical competitions, or even intellectual ones where my competition is just better than me.&nbsp; It doesn't really change anything.&nbsp; No matter the odds, no one likes to lose.&nbsp;   But the thing is, every event has a lesson to be derived from it.&nbsp; Whether it's something as simple as 'you did not prepare as well as X,' there's always something to draw from every event.&nbsp; The important part is to be able to draw the core of the matter from the event, regardless of circumstances.&nbsp;   I've always tried my best to do that, no matter how harsh the situation.&nbsp; I'm not saying that everyone should, but everyone should definitely do their best to find the positive in anything.&nbsp; I've known people in my life who were so concerned with the method of conveyance that they could never comprehend the lesson they should have learned.&nbsp;   The problem is, I hate losing.&nbsp; And to me, a lesson missed is a battle lost.&nbsp; Things change though.&nbsp; Time has made me more understanding of people's flaws, and if people choose to stay in their misery (as I've chosen to do several times in my past) then so be it.&nbsp;   My brother, before he left, said something quite interesting-- "You're blackening my aura =P"&nbsp; That is, I was being negative and adjusting things accordingly.&nbsp;   My detail at work is over, and soon it will be back to my regular inspectional duties.&nbsp; After two months of struggle, I've learned quite a bit, and the first thing is:&nbsp; let people be.&nbsp; There are people out there who don't care about doing the right thing, and only care about their own bottom line.&nbsp; I do my best to avoid them.&nbsp; I see challenges as just that, challenges, opportunities for me to test my limits, instead of being shown that I can't surpass them.&nbsp;   After two months, I think my aura's been cleansed of any blackening.&nbsp;   I'm ready for the rest of the world.

      Following up on that article on what Western men see in Asian Women, is the AWU (Asian Women United)'s survey on how Asian women are portrayed on Television.  &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.asianwomenunited.org/survey_feb04_results.shtml   &nbsp;  Not to say that EVERYONE would want to see Asian women like that, but this is just more confirmation for me (and quite a few other folks, mind you) that the argument of Asian men being the suppressors and ones that should change.  &nbsp;  It's ridiculous what I see out there.&nbsp; Nevermind how poorly Asian men are portrayed, but you know, I'd rather be anonymous than bow down to the Man and let William Hung represent us.&nbsp; Ladies, welcome to being the next sex toy fad of the decade.&nbsp; All thanks to your 'saviors' from the evil asian chauvanist pig men.  &nbsp; Actually, I want to make clear that I've got nothing against men of other color as a whole.&nbsp; Granted every race and ethnicity are going to have assholes here and there, it just irritates me to no end when my fellow countrywomen say things like 'I'm never dating an Asian man because they're all chauvanist bastards who treat me like an object.' &nbsp; Welcome to the real world!

      So in the current issue of Maxim, there's a girl from Berkeley featured (part of it is her job, that is, working at the marijuana clinic in Berkeley) (though the fact that there's a 'marijuana clinic' at all is another topic altogether).&nbsp; Her name is Meng Lau, and she's Cambodian. &nbsp; It's nice to see Asians in the public eye, especially when they're not being treated stereotypically.&nbsp; At this point, Meng's just another pretty gal in a bikini.&nbsp;  &nbsp; That said, I'm surprised at what photography and make up can do.&nbsp; I've certainly met prettier women, which is not a knock on Ms. Lau (who is, I admit, quite attractive), but it makes me think. &nbsp; What is it that makes a woman attractive?&nbsp; I'm not sure yet, actually.&nbsp; Guess I'll have to define that as time goes on =D

      So my brother and sister are going to the Philippines, and it's going to be a while before I see him again.  My brother and I have never been 'close' or 'trusting' or all that other mushy stuff, but what it does come down to is that he is my brother, and he's done everything he can to make sure that I grow up okay.    I can't count the number of times that he's watched my back through elementary school, mainly because we didn't really hang around.  Nonetheless, when some older kid that I had gotten into a fight with (and still have the chipped tooth to show for it) came by my classroom apologizing, I quite quickly realized that he was looking out for me.    What I, and the rest of you out there need to keep on realizing is that family is family.  In any non-psychotic situation, your family is what's going to be there for you when everything goes to shit.  My sister, my mom, and my dad, they've all done what they can to raise me and raise me well, to imbue me with a sense of self and confidence to live the rest of my life.  But I also realize that my family is more than my brother, my sister, and my parents.   Some of my friends are close enough to call family.  In fact, they're more family than most of my family.  I'm not going to get into the drama of my extended idiot family (they know who they are).  Things work out on way or another.  I'll miss my brother, and he knows that.  Even if we've never as much as exchanged a handshake =P

      Oh.   My.  God.  And I thought *I* had some issues...  I mean, don't get me wrong, the phenomenon is not just restricted to Korean Women, but with Asian women in general.  It's quite strange, and the strangest part is, it's written by one of us (that is, Asian folk)!     urlLink What is it about Korean Women that Western Men like?   Here's the article quoted just in case the article gets pulled or something.  From the Digital Chosunilbo:  What is it about Korean Women that Western Men Like?   We know that Korean-American Alice Kim (Korean name: Kim Yong-gyeong) will marry Hollywood star Nicolas Cage in June. Kims uncle, an executive at a credit agency, said in an interview with a Korean daily paper that, I understand that Alice Kim and Nicolas Cage will marry in June. This marriage may be postponed, however; Cage is leaving for Africa in July to shoot his new film, Lord of War.     Why are American film stars into Korean women? Kenny, an executive at a LA Koreatown broadcasting company, said in an interview with a Korean broadcaster that, Korean women are submissive and kind. They are known to make breakfast, lunch and dinner for their husbands, help their husbands well, and raise children well." There are also those who feel that in the eyes of Western men, East Asian women possess a sort of mysteriousness about them. They say that one can grow fond of the unknown Orient." 24-year-old James Cecil, an American living in Korea, said, Even Korean women who are not though of as pretty by Korean men can give a sense of mystery to Western men. 29-year-old English teacher Mike Conforty said, Korean women are gentle, feminine and quiet. I think Korean women are the prettiest of all East Asian women.   Western men also seem to find the purity and conservativeness of Korean women attractive. 25-year-old USFK soldier Blake Selesnew said, American women are too materialistic, but Korean women arent. They seem less snobby. Korea University English instructor Zane Ivy said, Korean women are conservative. They are conscience of what people around them think, depend on their families and parents and are submissive.  Before Alice Kim and Nicolas Cage, other Hollywood couples with Korean women included Wesley Snipes and Nikki Park and Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn. Less well known was About Schmidt director Alexander Paynes marriage last year to Korean-Canadian actress Sandra Oh. Meanwhile, Woody Allen attended a literature event last October in Frankfurt, Germany and said he would write an autobiography containing the story of how he split from long-time lover Mia Farrow and fell in love and married Farrows adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn.   -end story-  What the hell?  I mean, way to perpetuate stereotypes.  I don't know what's worse, really-- the people who think this, or the people that just don't see it.  I understand quite well that most old-school Asian cultures are highly patriarchal, and as a result, the rest of my fellow Asian men quite often don't help dispel the stereotypes (and neither does Hollywood, thank you very much.) about us.  I feel angry, but at the same time, aren't we all guilty of stereotyping one way or another?  I think about it, and the anger gives way to pity.  I mean, people out there may think that they're loved for who they are, but actually for what they 'represent'!    Again, I'll reiterate that I can't blame folks for finding Asian women attractive.  Who am I to argue? ;)  But it's a crying shame, much like the criminalization/hypersexualization of black men, or the villification of white men, that certain things exist.  It's not the women's fault, something I'm sure everyone here knows.  The fault lies with stereotyping bastards.    That scene from  Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story  says it best:  "Get one of your own!" "She IS one of my own."

      As some of you might know, I'm Catholic, and religious.    I had a moment today, to reflect on who I am, and what I want out of life.  I was thinking about my faith, and what I believe.  This is the prayer I say every night before I sleep.  "Lord, Let this cup of suffering be passed from my lips, but your will be done, not mine.    Lord, I don't know what I want in life yet, and I don't know where I'm going.  Guide me along the way.  You know what I need most out of life, more than I know what I want, so I leave my life in your hands.  Grant me the grace and wisdom to lead my life in the best way I can."

      The funny thing about anime is that the music and soundtracks are inherently superior to most other sci-fi or fantasy series out there.  American shows don't even put effort into it, it seems (with the notable exception to the opening theme to Star Trek:  Enterprise), content with the occasional orchestrated score that isn't even that good (see most star trek themes, and everything except the Empire's theme and the opening to star wars).  Take any Gundam track, for instance (Gundam is a war story that just happens to involve giant robots).  Now I don't think I'm wapanese (or chapanese, as it may be), but I just feel that anime soundtracks tend to be more modern and take more risks.    Listen to some sometime.  Ignore the words for the moment, just listen to the melodies.  Many of them are poppy, but you'll find that even then, they're much better than what say, Britney Spears makes.    A great example (aside from Gundam) is Record of Lodoss War.    Hope I piqued your curiosity a bit!

      Well, after having to have called in sick yesterday, I went in to work for the first time with the guidance of my trainer, the current Recall Coordinator for our district.    Quite frankly, it is a relief working with him again.  Despite quite a few screw ups on my part, I now have most everything under control and running smoothly, thanks in no small part to my trainer's influence and positive attitude.    One thing we share is the common feeling that quite a few people out there are just idiots.  While I don't have the credentials to say that, it helps to think that it's not just me that thinks that some of what the folks out there do is completely idiotic.    Which brings me to my main thrust-- a support network is the most important thing to a person's well being aside from a belief in God and a personal relationship with Christ.  My apologies, but as a Catholic, that's how I feel the world is, and that's just me.  Surrounded by people who weren't like me, my first move to the USA in contemporary times was a painful adjustment.  I wasn't sure quite who I was, and moreover, I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to be.  College was more of the same, with disagreements on race and race relations being pushed to the fore.    After college, I found that the world doesn't quite match the ideal that I felt it should.  Being with people who understood me, who sympathized with me, and more importantly, have walked a mile (or three!) in my shoes made me understand that there's more to life besides what conflicts there are now.  For better or worse, college shaped me into the person I am now-- an old fashioned, try-anything-once, have fun kind of guy who looks to the future and wants only the best for himself, without harming others.  When life has tossed me conflicts, it's always been God, family and friends who have always been there to pull me out.  When I worry about sinking down to the depths of the sellouts, the wannabes, the scum of the earth that would rather blame others rather than themselves, it was always my friends and family that reminded me that what was most important is that I am accountable for my own actions, and no one else's.    It's my dream that people out there find the group that reflects them, and completes them as people and servants of God.  All my friends, Christian or otherwise, have done that for me, and that's the greatest gift.   Let the work and toil come, I'll be ready to take it on...

      The problem with work right now is that work backs up if I'm not there to do it.  Thank god that this week, the guy I'm backing up returns to the office.  There's a lot of documentation to file and quite a few letters to send!  See, the way things are at work, is that firms have a certain amount of time to let us know what's going on.  The problem is, I have to keep pace with it, and right now, it's a little overwhelming.  My detail ends this month, and that's two or three more weeks to get everything down pat.  There are a couple of things to figure out, particularly when it comes to the various other fields and industries out there, but I'll pick that up soon enough.  That will seriously make me feel better.  As it is, I'm slowly learning, and another couple of weeks SHOULD be enough.  That said, I'm hoping for the best.    What's important is that I'm learning, and after this, I'm pretty much the assigned back up for the guy.  That's a good thing =D

      Just came from a friend's wedding.  That was quite cool.  My friends Chris and Jenny met two years ago, got engaged a year ago, and are now the happily married couple.  I'm so happy for them!  Things just worked out.  Chris is a hardworking guy who'll do anything to please Jenny, and Jenny's an all around decent and quality gal who will make Chris very happy.  It's weird for me to say that, because it just makes me think about my own plans in life.  I wonder not if I'll find someone, but how my life came to be what it is now.  I wonder if I made the right choices, said the right things, etc etc.  That said, upon analysis, I'm happy with my life.  Sure, I'm not rich, but in general, There's nothing wrong with my life, and in fact, every thing's so fun.  Oh well =)

      Now that I think about it, why do people support Michael Moore?  He's entertaining, sure, but only because he twists everything to match what he wants to say.  He's rude, abrasive, deceitful, hypocritical...  Ah, screw it.  The guy's an asshole, and if you don't look past the glitz and allure of associating with him in an effort to make yourself feel better, you'd best think again and look into what his work really is, and more importantly, both sides of the story.

      Hmm.  So Memoirs of a Geisha is going to be made into a movie.  Lovely.    I'm sure that Memoirs of a Geisha is a much-loved book by folks out there, since it constantly resurfaces whenever Asians feel the need to remind ourselves about the miserable things about our culture, or even better, when  other  folks feel the need to be 'Asian-aware.'  Well, the truth is, I don't mind stuff like this.  It irritates me a little, and no movie set stereotypes about Asian men in the modern day more than the Joy Luck Club.  Ladies!  Which of these negative idiots represents YOUR Asian man?  Then came Dances With Japanese, excuse me, The Last Samurai.  Ugh.  As  urlLink Angry Asian Man  put it, we don't get to see enough movies out there that present a White Man's Vision of Japan.  Ladies!  Time to get exoticized for the Man!  Takes me back to my college days... It makes me feel pretty bad, since I felt so much anger and resentment back then.  A couple of people stand out in my mind...  In fact, it's 5 years too late, but I finally realized the perfect christmas gift for that sellout...

      So I redecorated my tank a bit. There was one last white cloud mountain minnow at the petco, and I felt so bad for it, I took it home to meet my fishies. Meet Whitey, so named because he's so pale compared to the (healthier, I think, because they came from a specialized aquarium and not the walmart of pet stores) other fish in my tank, and because the other fish feel awkward around him.  Just kidding, really. I got nothin' against white folk. =D  But I DID figure out where to post photos, and here's a link to my fabulous tank =P

      I got my first batch of fish today.  First and foremost, let me plug Albany Aquarium on 818 San Pablo Avenue, Albany, CA.  Their guy Ginn(sorry if I misspelled it) and his staff are all quite knowledgeable, and patient!  He went over things with me on a very mellow, slow pace.  He never rushed me, never told me to do anything, and was always up front with me.  I ended up with 5 White Cloud Mountain Minnows, and two compact fluorescent lights.  I can't wait to get more, but for now, the five I have are actually distinct enough to name!  I'm quite pumped =D  I put them in at about 9:45 pm on 08/02/2004.    I'm still looking for webspace to put pictures up.  There's Spot, a female, so named because of a strange red spot on her side, Rebel, so named because he so often strikes out on his own, and... umm... okay, so the others haven't earned any special distinction.  None of the fish have taken a 'leadership role' , and they're behaving well, quite like fish.  Before I leave in the morning, I'm going to drop some food in, and hope they feed well!  They're supposed to be top strata fish, but they're chilling at the bottom.   Anyway, wish me luck on my new fishies.

      Went to go see  The Bourne Supremacy  today with my family.  I've heard that the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the book, which is fine and dandy, since lately, I've not really been thinking of watching an intellectual movie.  Now, that said, I've not seen the first Bourne movie.  The second movie covers things to a decent degree, but I wish I had seen the first before going to see the Supremacy.  That said, the Bourne Supremacy was a good romp and nice, without all the funky gadgets and lame clichés of the Bond series.  It's an elbow grease-do it yourself spy movie, and Matt Damon does quite a good job.  Like my dad said, he looks like an everyday guy, very believable, not a Hollywood pretty boy.  The other thing is that I finally got that fish tank from my friend Dan.  It's somewhere between 10-20 gallons, but I'm not quite sure what's going on.  Anyway, I've decided what kind of fish to go for after studying some of what would be considered 'good' starting species.   First, I'm going to start with some Harlequin Rasboras, which look quite striking, and close to what I had originally planned, which is, Cardinal Tetras.  But that said, I was also informed that Cardinal tetras are complete pains in the wazoo to get going, firstly because they can be very fickle and difficult to raise.  Harlequin Rasboras can be seen  urlLink here .   I'm planning to start with 6, and eventually rase the number t0 8-10.  After those come in, I may add some bottom feeders (if I can find hardy ones, I don't really like corydoras), or proceed to Neon Tetras.  They may be smaller and less colorful than Cardinals, but they seem (from most accounts) longer lived and easier to maintain.  The problem is, they may not last either, and i may not have the room for 24 fish.  I may just go with 8 Harleys, and add neons to season, with maybe two bottom feeders.  Thoughts, comments?
