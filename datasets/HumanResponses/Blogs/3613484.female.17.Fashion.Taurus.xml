      When you get a tan, what is actually happening is that the  melanocytes  are producing  melanin pigment  in reaction to ultraviolet light in sunlight.  Ultraviolet light stimulates melanin production.  The pigment has the effect of  absorbing the UV radiation in sunlight, so it protects the cells from UV damage.   Melanin production takes a fair amount of time - that is why most people cannot get a tan in one day. You have to expose yourself to UV for a short period of time to activate the melanocytes. They produce melanin over the course of hours. By repeating this process over 5 to 7 days pigment builds up in your cells to a level that is protective. The previous paragraph applies to Caucasians. In a variety of other races melanin production is continuous, so the skin is always pigmented to some degree. In these races the incidence of skin cancer is much lower because cells are constantly protected from UV radiation by melanin. Melanocytes actually produce two different pigments: eumelanin (brown) and phaeomelanin (yellow and red). Red heads happen to produce more phaeomelanin and less eumelanin, which is why they don't tan very well.     Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)  is produced by the  pituitary gland.  MSH flows through the bloodstream and reaches the melanocytes, encouraging them to produce more melanin (for example, a person injected with a large dose of MSH will get darker). The pituitary gland is actually quite interesting - it is tied into the optic nerve, which means that it can sense light.

      todays youth is becoming more and more passive. take the aim profile for example. what one does not have the nerve to address, one publishes in one's profile. i mean really dudes, how much more passive can you get? today us youths are being sucked into the black hole of passivity. so you write things in youre profile, or youre xangas   knowing   that ppl will read it and approach you about the subject at hand...geez, first our generation is blessed with the age of technology which, i might add, has produced a generation of LAZYASSES! ( and yes, i am one of them )...sad aint it? so not only has technology aided in the evolution of a new generation of lethargic tech freaks, it has breeded in us a sense of passivity that, like cancer, slowly deteriorates the essence of human interaction. goddamn.  so to this i say  cheers to my   botch   who i owe this enlightenment to. bc i am a member of generation passive lazyass. but i must do as i preach and "grow some damn balls!" or  boobs  in my case. passivity is no longer an option for me! the lethargy, im workin on that. but passivity, youre ass is mine!   and THAT is what i thought about int he shower today. yay for the happy place!

          so today we had another meet...and next week we have yet ANOTHER meet...but i SWEAR ill swim 3 events next week...i swear!.....well ill try haha....so i guess this meet was like blah except its really really odd that vin's image stayed with me even after i left...and it was odd how i kinda sauntered to my car just so i could walk through the parking lot at the same time he was....yea odd...       SO....since we left so damned early..still feel kinda guilty about that....but ah well the girls didnt even show and vin and that whole gang left too so i guess it sort of eases the guilt...but anyways...so me and jon ahd some time to kill....decided to go to michaels and wherever else...well things took a turn for the....wouldnt say worse...but it wasnt all that great either...       this will be in a nutshell but reliving it all is kinda tiresome...oh! speaking of tiresome MAN was i groggy today after my nap! and man was i fatigued before my nap! but anyways, back to my misadventure...hah, thats what it was! a misadventure! ok, so back to it... i went on the freeway...anticipated the traffic so instead of taking 101 back to san jose....i went straight to god knows where...i deno the name of the freeway but i was on my way towards valley fair! so i exited on 11th st i think...made my way downtown and decided hey lets go to the library since my brother needed some chem books anyway...so i drove around for a bit bc i didnt really know where the library was...haha everywhere downtown looks kinda the same...anyways i found it...but passed it...so i made a FATTY and i do mean like fatbastard-tub-of-lard FATTY circle and made my way BACK to the library parking lot which i made some illegal manuver to get to....driving down the wrong way on a ONEWAY street....yes...i am so embarrassed...anyways went in parked and walked to the library only to be TURNED AWAY bc i was closing! my god! all that for NOTHING! geeeez....so we went back and i drove off to michaels where we got the t shirts and then we went home...and oh yea...i almost ran into a bus...what kinda genius puts a bus stop right in front of a parking lot entrance i mean really...am i just being a dimwit or is that an INGENIUS idea?! i mean who woulda thought that a car would turn into the parking lot at the ENTRANCE i mean wow...geeez...so the bus was there loading and unloading passengers and i went around it and was about to turn and the bus moves foward! its like dude...wtf are you doing? i dont really blame the driver but...WHO THE HELL PUTS A BUS STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE?! i mean geeez man! what kinda idiots run this country? HAH       so there you have it my misadventure...bet i scared the shits outa my little brother...           and you know, i still cant shake vinh's image from my mind

      ooo those bastards! interrupted my reading just when it was getting good and now i cant get back into it...raaar  but guess who called?  robert chau  however you spell his last name...interesting....such a responsible young man when he wants to be...a waste that he has raging hormones and inappropriate tactics for gaining attention...anyways so robert called asking about fundraising and all that wonderful shit..and guess who put him up to it?  JASON ....how so very  interesting .... i mean dude...that fool, unfortunately, lives like around the corner from me...and can call me anytime given that hes family...and yet he gets  robert  to call? this tells me two things:  1. the boys' captains are lazyass dramamas with their own heads up their ass 2. the boys' captains  know  that me and krystal arent gonna help them with  shit   so they get little robert to do the dirty work....i see....tricky little bastards they are....tricky

      i am  never  going to get my hair cut  ever  again.   whats up with thess hair cutter people?  fuck   man! do they  not  understand the meaning of the word " trim "? i mean cmon man! im sure they taught you how to  TRIM  in beauty school...    "please trim about  2   inches  off " does  not  mean "please  chop off  about  5 inches  of my hair"...or maybe in  lost-in-fucked-up-hair-cutting-land  is does...who knows...   and another thing! who the  fuck  taught that chick how to  layer ? because my hair looked like it was cut by a  fat, stinky CHIMP!      and to have to pay money for someone to fuck up my hair...man that is that last straw... if it hadnt been for the fried ends i wouldnt have had to get it cut...but from now on i say FUCK ALL YOU HAIR CUTTER PEOPLE WHO SHOULDA FLUNKED OUTA BEAUTY SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU DONT KNOW TO TRIM AND LAYER....im cutting my own hair now...stupid motherfuckers...

KRYSTAL AND JESSICA MAYBE?!  so that  fucking bastard  can just shut his  fucking piehole  bc if  ANYONE  is a  BAD CAPTAIN  its that  mutherfucking lazyass powerhungry i-think-im-the-shit FOOL!  yea thats right! mutherfucker...
