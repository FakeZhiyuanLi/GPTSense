						   I don't think anything else can be as sick as "Monday Morning". It is only at this hour that I keep imagining of rushing countrysides, lazy afternoons, or reading a book, or travelling for that matter. Well, I can think of anything other than office. I think everything else looks better.  But the point is, if I feel bad on a Monday morning, it means that I've had a fantastic weekend. And I am looking forward for more.

						   The first question I would like to ask to the world is, why a father's day? Or for that matter, why a mother's day? And then, there's a sister's day as well. Is there a brother's day? I don't know. All I know is that there seems to be an explosion of these "days" nowadays.  Somehow, it makes one feel as if we don't think about our fathers or mothers the rest of the days. It makes one feel as if father's day is the only day when you go to one of those greeting card stores and buy a card for father.  So what about the other days? Have we at any point of time brought a card just out of the blue and gave it to our dad? I don't think so. Atleast in my case, I have not done it. Perhaps my answer to that would be that I would show my love and affection to dad in a variety of other ways. Perhaps one day I would like to get up earlier than dad does, and make him a cup of coffee. Or for that matter, lay the table for dinner, and of course clean up the table after dinner, without dad having to do it. I really want to do this.  But the problem is, I don't want to wait for a "father's day" to do that.  Because after all, he is my father. And I don't need anybody else to point out to me when I should celebrate father's day. Every day of my life is father's day. Every day of my life is sister's day.  For me, there shan't be a particular day when I would suddenly start thinking how fantastic my dad is, or how kind he is to me.  I love my father and that is it.

						   We all know that they are just two parallel pieces of iron going somewhere. But when I look at them, I am filled with peace. It is not just the railway tracks but the things that surround a railway track, which makes it even more interesting. If one notices, the complete scene changes when you near a railway track - a railway crossing for example.

						   Well, this is really such a stupid question, isn't it? But what would the answer be? Well, on a weekend, I would do anything, which I am not able to do on a working day. From that perspective, on a weekend, I would opt to do NOTHING.
