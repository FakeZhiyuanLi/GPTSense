        After all, I'm not sure that I'm so angry with you, for it means that now you've got to remain here indefinitely, nolens volens.

      10 reasons why Singapore isn't a good target for terrorist ================================================= 1. Too confusing: is Singapore in China? 2. Too valuable: Singapore is the place in Southeast Asia with the best facilities to hold a terrorist conference. 3. Too risky - your robes might get caught in MRT doors and you could be dragged to your death. 4. Too expensive: to buy cars in Singapore to place the bombs in them. 5. Too little airspace: Trying to fly a plane into a building is too difficult as you're very likely to accidentally langgar either airforce jets practicing for the National Day Parade or the Starhubblimp. 6. Too leceh: to hit a sizeable mass of people, you have to be constantly updated as to which part of the island having a closing/ opening/ moving/ renovation/ mid-year/ end-of-year/ end-of-season/ anniversary/ pre-whatever/ post-whatever/ storewide/ Great Singapore/ Heartland Singapore SALE; or giving away free tickets/ books/ gifts/ Hello Kittys/ balloons... 7. Too gross: you have to drink your recycled pee here. 8. Too complicated: before you conduct a campaign of terror, you'll have to make sure you don't clash with the Courtesy Campaign, the Speak Good English Campaign, the Speak Mandarin Campaign, etc, etc 9. Too late: by the time the terrorists get here, most of the Singaporeans would have emigrated anyway. 10. Too small: it takes too much time finding the small dot on the world map and they may miss it and hit M'sia instead. That's a no-no as M'sia is largely occupied by Muslims.
