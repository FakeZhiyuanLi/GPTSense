       urlLink Finallly a page of our Baltimore Pictures   Went to the hospital yesterday for Ross and spent 7 hours there.  Ross has this thing with him that well is his own and I do not have a right to publish, but he is fine and feeling better now. It was my first time in ER in years, last time I don't even remember it.  A lot of old people, alot of waiting.  Wouldn't suggest it, but he was gonna drive himself and well I do not think he could even resite the alphabet let alone drive himself there with no supporting friend.  But I would like to say that I started this blog, and my others, because sometimes I believe I actually have something interesting to say.  To me this is nothing really personal, it is things that I would tell a friend.  My away messages get to involved and well they cut me short so I started this blog so that I could ramble on about my day, people and politics.  Also wanted a place where people could find out about me, and where I could share with my friends pictures and moments of life.  Sometimes I even find a good website to share with you.  But I think most peoples' fears are the fear of being forgotten and of expiring and no one having taken a notice to them.  Everyone wants to be heard and everyone wants what they feel and who they were to some way be remembered.  I think in person I am mostly quiet, it is easier for me to write and do my art which I enjoy.  My Art and actual Writings stay private, but this is so I can rant and maybe someone will agree with me, or take interest.  I wanted to share myself so here it is, a blog.... so blog yourself silly world!  urlLink

       So  Spring Break :  No it was not much of a spring break. Ross and I BOTH became ill. But it is okay, we are going on a long cruise to the  urlLink Carribean  soon. But none the less   we did go with Ross's parents to  urlLink Baltimore  for the day. We walked around, had   crab cakes and went to the  urlLink Aquarium . I love the aquarium there and haven't   been for years. Ross has the pictures on his camera of all the  urlLink Sting   Rays !  I love those really really pretty animals. I want one for my own some day.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink        urlLink http://www.baltimore.org/    urlLink http://www.baltimoretourism.com/   So that was that, oh yeah and there was a rainforest part to the aquarium,   they are also updating it so who knows what other neat shit they will have.     And in between the myriad of Dr.'s appointments I helped Ross learn to ride a bike. No sir, he did not know how to ride a bike. Drive a car, skateboard, rollerblade, but apparently they walked everywhere in his town so no need to bike. Since I love to go biking he decided it was due time to learn, and well he's a natural. Just look for teh 6'6&quot; guy on the bike.         So both Rossnami and I had interesting Dr. appointments, my ending with a NEW HORRIBLE hospital visit soon. But then I won't need all those meds. It's funny when you think that science should be able to find out why and how things come about but then the dr sits there and says &quot;no one knows how this happens&quot;. Yay, but no biggie, it's not cancer or life threatening, or a VD, just my body going all silly. So make sure to take ur probiotics or else ur immunity goes all interesting. And Ross well his is genetic and leads to many a night of him puking. But soon we both will be better and ready for that cruise. We may even out live you.

       So wait for the Spring Break update please:   (I need some time to do that)   So, I talk in my sleep... and do things.  I also stop breathing.  Which disturbs me, how long have I done this?  Ross once convinced me I was on TV and I waved to the audience.  And another time well the background is you know that commercial with Kermit the frog and everyone in it, the joke is Animal goes "sausages" really loud. And as a joke I'm like he might as well be saying "PENIS", you know sausage=penis.  And I'm like next time u order pizza I'm gonna yell PENIS into the phone, so while I'm sleeping i start saying "sausages PENIS sausages PENIS".  Yeah, really funny.  And then I snore and stuff on top of it, sometimes strip articles of clothing.... weird huh. And I do this WHILE at Ross's house with his parents around.  Grab a chair, my life can be tragically funny...  And so far the sick count is at like five different things, just added a new one the other day.  Have to go to the hospital and all that fun shit. Sugery, whatever.  This coming weekend is our  Party .  Message me if you want in.  "Is our love to savage" - "Well that one time it was weird" - "What when I was drunk?" - sealab 2020  I have come back to loving Pearl Jam and the Vitalogy Album.  It is the old grunge babe coming out, Courtney Love style.  But really it's good.   I don't want to take what you can give... I would rather starve than eat your breast... All the things that others want for me... Can't buy what I want because it's free... Can't be what you want because I'm... I ain't s'posed to be this far Oh, to live and die, let it be done I figure I'll be damned, all alone like I began... It's your move now... I thought you were a friend, but I guess I, I guess I hate you...   urlLink Pearl Jam Courduroy     Like I said I'll get the updates when I get the Pictures in.... and time don't forget I have none of it.

      Well  FINALLY  can sign back in Blogger, had difficulties with well stuff.  Well  newest first , last night me and the girls from home tried out  urlLink River St. NightClub .  It was pretty cool and well we all had our share of funny moments. Even have pictures thanks to Jen.  It was great catching up and then going to sober up at a dinner and then dragging my buzzed self home to my dorm at  6:00am . ;-)  We gave out our fair share of numbers too, thanks to the new age of cell phones they now know when we lie! (Just like old time...)  Next well I was watching last adult swim and I just LOVED this  quote : -hun if i dont make it, i want you to be burried alive with me -yes dear  oblongs   OH and Rosses  Quote : "I am filled with a Sick Twisted Creativity" -  Ross   We had to sadly cancel out plans to Canada, I decided it's to cold for this chick. And then we were going to go to  urlLink SOTB (South of the Border)  but then that would take to much time and I need to be home Thursday and Friday for appointments!   SOOOO  we are now only doing a day trip. I figured this was fine since we have a cruise to go on in the summer to the  Carribean  and can go to Canada any weekend we get bored with life on campus.  I have been working on  updates  for this site including new pictures and buttons on the side w/ a new color theme but! I had to put all this aside due to the fact that I have SSSOOO much work next week due (partially due to my slacking this week) that it is making me insane. So School wise I am working my ass off (if only literally).  Having a  Party in April  sometime, if you are reading this you are probably invited, so Message me on IM if you want an invite and INFO  So I Leave now.  Maybe I will cut down on my bar intake  NEXT  week.... ross informed me I go about 1-2 times a week.  I just didn't realize it.  LOVE YOU ROSSNAMI  and feel better!            The type of ex I am is:           m i s s i n g           My ex and I took the term "breaking up" very seriously and no longer have any contact. I am ready for new lovin'.         urlLink what type of ex are you?   |  urlLink mewing.net. 'EX'cellent. HA.

I have the most beautiful flowers!!! Ross suprised me with Gerbera Daises with a card that said, "Just because it's Tuesday! Love, Ross".  It was by far the highlight of these few weeks!  Thank you Ross!!!! Love you SO MUCH!!!  So just to let you know look out for  BRAND NEW PICTURES In the pictures portion of my site.  Eh, nothing else to say, except, "I am filled with a sick sick creativity". late

      Watching the View today and I saw this video I now want!!! I know its Carmen Electra... and she has this horribly stupid rainbow on it but I heard  urlLink aerobic striptease  is a great way to exercise.  But really, the cover is just to much, you wish bitch.  She's pretty but that done up photo just makes her look horrible. And I don't want to go to work!!!!!

      You know when you encounter that one thing that always just sets ur life into chaos and disorder, well I encountered it about Thursday in the wee morning hours after working on a presentation. And no matter how hard I try I can't get it back, that order, that feeling that I belong in this skin. I woke up from some odd dream and that Outside song by Staind was in my head. I just can't shake that feeling...  Well last night was our sat night of  debauchery ! (ive been itching to use that word since I saw it on spongebob): Taco Bell (two #8s and a nacho supreme), movie (catch me if you can), popcorn(extra butter) and candy(mike ikes, snow caps, sour straws, whoppers) with my  baby (Rossnami) - who could ask for more!!! The movie I was avoiding because of all the hype wasn't half bad, I really loved the opening credits and shrudder to think how much time they put into those.  I think this was the start of "oh my god im gonna be doing this the rest of my life" question. Gave up architecture, law and museum curation for this! But it was a good movie, laughable even at the saddest moments.  Watching that movie was followed by watching two other HORRIBLE tv movies.  You know the kind you laugh at becasue its SO BAD rather than actually watching it. Man, this feeling is gonna haunt me until I have proper distractions.Very weird, eww, there was a spa bath in my dream and now one on the tv! But mine was spegetti! Something about piranahs and saving atlanta... very very odd! Sometimes I miss that feeling of sponteneity, of fleeting love and being so engulfed with it its close to encompassing all the feelings you had. Whatever...!!!   Some sights I want to share...    urlLink Ron's TeeGarden    urlLink The bar we like to go to...

      I do not regret leaving, till i rose i never felt okay, no more hurt for this rose. It was wrong for me to try to think that sleeping beauty could be helped. I sold my soul one dollar at a time, and now I have none of it left. This hallow will never be hole, but I give me one more medicated moment. He did this, took all I had, still I pray never stray. And I don't want to feel this overwhelming hostility... but it's difficult not to feel a little dissapointed, passed over. I believed I could cure it all, for you dear. show me the way to forgive you allow me to let it go illuminate me i'm just praying  for you to show me where i'm to begin reconnect to you and I will not fall down lying all alone and restless. unable to lose this image. thinking of you my reflection wraps and pulls me under guides me safely in worlds i’ve never been to heal me but i've been over this before been over this BEFORE  Mer De Noms  Metaphor for a missing moment Pull me into your  Perfect Circle   I do not regret leaving. I regret loosing the person I thought I had. I miss the person I met, not you. We all make mistakes, but do you put none of the blame on yourself? So I keep searching for the perfect somone I have so clearly in my mind. It is better to have loved and lost, but what if you never loved at all?

      First thank you to my Uncle Ed and Dawn who let Ross and I stay in their new apartment.  We really did appreciate it.  It was right in D.C. and well it was great to be so close to the rally.  It was also cool to be so close to the musuems.  I also saw my Grandmother Nikki, Rolf and Bill.  Sorry to everyone else I missed this time.  I will be having lunch with my Aunt Goo whom I have not seen for over a year!   urlLink    The count last I heard was over a  Million .  They had only permits for 700,000.  Pro-Lifers were no more than a hundred and some were even arrestted for protesting with out a permit. Our own pictures will be up shortly. Ross was interviewed by the  urlLink WASHINGTON POST  and College something. We got there around 10:00am and met up with other  urlLink Ramapo Students  listened to speakers such as Hilary Clinton and then Marched on Washington at 12:30pm.  After completing the circle which took about a hour and a half we sat and listened to speakers from all over and from such organizations such as NAACP, and celebrities and the like. Well it's true many people feel strongly about this March for Women's Lives  but why do I do this?  (prepare for rant till links below - i've had better but its early right now)  They consider  urlLink Emergency Contraceptive  to be an Abortion by THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS.  I do not. All Pro-Lifers just have this religious stance, and well not everyone is Christian, not everyone follows your God and I certainly don't! And well, "If you don't believe in abortion, Don't have one" I believe what I would choose for myself is not what others would choose. I would not, nor have I ever had an abortion. But some people can not pay for BirthControl, some people can not pay for the Pregnancy Test, and some people can not pay to have the abortion or to take the time off work to have the child, or even to pay for the child once in this world.  So I believe that it is for them, to make abortion more accessible and to make REAL SEX ED more accessible. I do not aggree with our funding to be dedicated to Absitinence, I believe teaching prevention and knowledge is the best way. I do not think it should be a choice between eating dinner that week or getting an abortion. It should be a private issue. I do not think WHITE MEN should decide WHAT IS OKAY FOR MY BODY. It is my CHOICE, do not decide my choice and everyone elses based on your own choices. And how dignified can you be waving baby fetus' around.  They weren't your's and they are not from abortions they were form late term miscarriages. Could you imagine being that Mother's whose unborn child that is getting waved around at Marches. It is okay to give birth to a child, it helps feed the war machine.  It is okay to kill SONS AND DAUGHTERS once fully grown in WAR.  So long as we have enough BODIES to send over THEN ITS OKAY?! I am a Catholic Anti-War Pro-Choice college student. It makes more sense for me to have abortion, I do not believe EC kills a child, I do not think in 72hours that is a child. I still have the choice. They are Pro-Choice so that they can kill whatever 18 and up person they can find. Carring a DEAD SOLDIERS picture would be illegal! To me those people fighting deserve not to die in vain. AND I DESERVE MY CHOICE - MY FREEDOM!

      I went into this weekend relaxed and full of money, I came out tired and broke.  Friday wasn't to bad. Went home for some  urlLink Valley Brewery  and then in the morning Gardened till dinner time and ate at  urlLink El Coyete . That was simple... After dinner I had to finish things around the house and rush back to my dorm so that Crystal wouldn't kill me for making us late going to NYC Club  urlLink Spirit . We none the less left late (it was me, suprised?).  So we are hauling ass to get there, parking in Hoboken to take the path on the way picking up a pretzel and water. We get there and become some random guys couples so that we can get in easier. If you go sign up on the guest list. We get in and loose the guys, and it's the regular crowd. Pricey friggin drinks and never go to a man-tender there, they take forever, the females take  less time mixing a drink. So we start dancing and then creep guys start dancing w/ me and pushing me into his friend, like Night at the Roxbury style, only worse and only to me! Guy from the start saves us and we start dancing again. The guys there you can't tell if they are gay or just bi-courious or... maybe straight, but it is all questionalbe. I don't care really cuz I am not looking. We get into VIP no problem, and leave b/c it's beat and you can't dance there. WE CAME TO DANCE! Back to dancing and drinking, finally at 4:50 I had to get out I was so tired and dying of heat. We start walking and Crystal talks about her frustrations of men at the club. A guy butts in and we start talking to him, I judge him at about 30-35. We talk and he suggest Marquee down the street. And offers us a cab ride toward the path and drinks. We get there bullshit and this guy buys us drinks. I ask where he works and he's like &quot;the  urlLink chrysler  building, its the tall shinny one&quot;. I'm like I KNOW, please only one of the most popular architectures, I live and breathe I know what that building is. So he walks the rest of the way to the path and we sit and wait (falling asleep) for the path.   Get home finally and I pick up  urlLink MCDonalds Breakfast  for us all (Crystal, Ross and I). I get a McGriddle for Ross and I, and I house it as soon as I get back. I lay next to Ross and happy to be next to a sane man who is so great and I say &quot;Goodnight *kiss* I Love You MCGriddle Sandwich *kiss*&quot;, and right after passed out. Ross thought it better to let it go considering I had good intentions of telling HIM I loved HIM and not the sandwich. I assure you I SWORE I said Ross.   Morning, after falling asleep at 6am, I wake up at 12am to try and go to the city for Ross and his  urlLink AUTO SHOW . This was my early b-day gift to him, and I wanted to take him last week but I FORGOT, so I have to do this while hungover. I get upset and start balling how I ruined his birthday present, and while crying he starts making fun of me and my noises! Now I am totally confused cuz two minutes ago he was mad at me, and now he's like cracking jokes. I start laugh/crying and all a sudden everything is great and I'm getting ready. I didn't know what to do, he totally tricked me and it was great but, wow someone shouldn't have the power to do that! It was cute and I love him!!! So another drive to weehawken or whatever to hop a ferry to Javis Center. We get there and walk around the place till we are  Exausted. LOOK ME ON A VESPA   urlLink     urlLink Also have the Album For you!!!!! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Click ME&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Saw Ross's future car, our future Bently and Mazardi and also my future HUMMER orignal! Then went over to  urlLink O'Farrell's  with Mom suggestion. She used to work in that area. &quot;Fine food, Strong Drink, Irish Hospitality&quot; and that it was! Very Irish servers.... Headed home and took a  &quot;nap&quot; at 7:30pm, didn't wake up till 8:30am and to a beautiful day I might add. Ross I love you HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY and I hope you enjoyed it.   We will see kill bill 2 soon I PROMISE

      Had a fun filled day yesterday, Wei stopped by to see everyone, and after work I was actually partaking in our school's many activities. Saw yoga, went to VVA (first time ever), belly dancing, coffee house, rcore, WSAWSR and then drank martinis and chilled w/ the roomies and friends.  Was a very very active day and I liked it.  To bad it's still cold, but ATLEAST it is sunny.  Also had trouble speaking... I was thinking and speaking but there was no way I could prevent one or the other from coming out.  So I was thinking what I should be doing or about a conversation, and I would say a portion out loud while talking to whoever it was I was speaking with. So I ended up calling Ross Hubby, and I think I made a tons others.  It was my brian's off day I suppose.  Just hope not to many random people noticed... that sleep walking is a def. problem.  And now I'm at work! I had a day off class so I decided to cover for a co-worker, smart right, should have slept in...  So on with my story..... So this friend of mine from home is telling me over the phone his story of the time he went to D.C. to protest WTO (which is what rcore is doing) "So I walk into the cell and the cop is known by name to the 20 people that are there so I think 'regulars".  And when the cop leaves a Puerto Rican guy says, 'Another white boy, I'm gonna fuck you up.... nah I'm just kidding." A conversation begings and they ask why he's in there. 'I am in here for protesting  urlLink World Trade Organization , they said I assualted a police officer'. (he threw a bean bag that hit him and it by accident hit a cop that was clubbing him at the time). And the Puerto Rican guy, Pablo, says 'You got balls protesting,  you have a house and a job, wtf do you have to complain about'.  Good point my  friend notes, 'But I am protesting so we have more jobs, so everyone can have a job'. Pablo responds, 'Yeah they are jobs no one wants, what do you think?, like i would want to work in fucking  urlLink Bopal  !'. An obvious well educated guy who has more knowledge than the common college student. And they are in there for a while so might as well keep company...

      - Magnolia  So first and for most visit this site  urlLink  MEATRIX  ! It's a parody but it's something I believe in. I do all organic now, started my own garden, and no I still bath rock out and do anti hippie things, but I am being better to my body and environment cuz I plan on being here for a while.  Now my pessimistic blurb, “I went looking for love, and it let me down. I’m in college and I can’t find money...” I just remember a comment someone once said, and it was ironic because it was someone who I spotted countless times and was broke all the time. They said all woman are whores and only want money, when from my perspective this guy was out for money... but it just pissed me off to be lumped in to some imaginary catagory this obvious insecure male made up. So I’m talknig to my friend and my obvious pessimist view on relationships comes out AGAIN. That whole people fake themselves into being happy, fleeting, hopless and unequal.  See last blog...  And now I am at work sitting here waiting for the computers to upgrade sometime this century...  I have a story to tell, I’ll add to this later but for now I’M GONE

       Jen is now Duece 2's!!!    My fish missed me this weekend .  I was away Friday - Sunday. Saturday Ross and I worked our asses off all day getting the garden together and then Sunday I did the Easter thing w/ my Dad and Sisters, then dinner with my Mom and John. I took my sister out Saturday for her 13th Birthday Dinner, she's a cheap date. Went to Charlie Brown's and she had fries and the salad bar, no wonder she keeps so thin. But it was fun to talk and do the sister thing. We also made cookies together at 11pm, woke Dad but what ya gonna do, it was fun.   I really do love my sisters so much.  The  garden  looks great, it really is cool working so hard on something and seeing it grow to be something beautiful.  We have LOTS of mint, so much, but a few flowers like Roses and my favorite, Bleeding Hearts. Did a lot of thinking, yes me!, about everything. It may be odd but I act out conversation senarios that will never happen with people I prob will avoid or just not see.  Never works out the way I want to, mostly because I lack the balls to say really mean things or stand up for myself. This usually happens in the shower cuz it is my only alone time and well started because I was always mad at my parents and couldnt very well tell them what I was really thinking.  I came up with this thought, I didn't know I had. Since I talk in my sleep I have these amazing conversations with Ross and I do not remember because they are my dreams I forget by morning. So my  thought  was that life is like a tree. We start small and each experience branches out and becomes more developed or as Ross said I said, "each decision we make leads to another branch, one dies and one grows. what we get is a bit irregular but its  beautiful  when it's done".  I guess I will never really know. And one time after the Matrix Revolutions I sit straight up in bed and say, "I get it, the real reason we all live is to die", and then back down to snoring I go. Silly, I am a deeper thinker in my sleep.   Interesing site . I don't know why people dig these chicks, but they do and well it's sorta disturbing. But Suicide Girls, you can see them at shows, view their blog or make ur own there. It's a good set up for a blog too, but alas the whole ugly  urlLink suicide girls  kinda turns me off.  My theory is find someone without suicidal issues, been there done that, just ends up to you wishing they would actually for once follow through with it. Drama queens the lot of them, and well there's better looking chicks in  urlLink PLAYBOY  and they don't talk back in blogs ;-).    urlLink  OH AND RAMAPO COLLEGE'S SPRING BREAK   it's even got pictures!!! But really you go to spring break far far away in hopes of not meeting people you know and well drinking and partying and we are young so we may or may not have sex. Why though would you do an article so late into spring break? The real ones are the week before! So of course they run into alot of Ramapo students cuz our school has to be gay and let spring break come so late and well our school sucks at schedules. So even when I go on Spring Break I run into every Ramapo student there. But my vacation will be different!  Oh so much boozing there will be! Well I'm beat, and Ross's radio show is over soon, and I'm missing him already! He played N.E.R.D. "she wants to move" for me! "Sometimes I fear we are to cute" "oh shniggle snoop" -futurama

      hmmm... So I have a problem with people being jerks. NO I will not sit there and take it because truthfully I don't like putting up with people's bullshit. I have enough of my own crap in my own life I do not need yours on top of my own. So if you're gonna act like an asshole, well then fine but do it somewhere and to someone else. I'm worth more than that, and you being an idiot is just insulting to yourself.  Really love  Pearl Jam  all over again, I found my Vitology CD. Can't find my other one though, the one with  urlLink  RearView Mirror   on it.  Great song... Also  Coming Up From Behind by Marcy's Playground . Ross intruduced me to that one.  And I went through the hell that is housing selection.  Village 13E  with my roomies Crystal, Josie and Chrissy. Ross also succeeded in getting CPA! Congrats to all.  Been working out, yoga and Winsor Pilates, sometimes the gym with Crystal.  Went off my diet because of Easter, will start up again.  Have to look great in my bikini when we go to the Carribean. They have topless beaches right?  J/K , you know that doesn't matter to me, like I need permission!!!   EASTER is coming up, and PASSOVER , so happy holidays. Going home for Easter breakfast and dinner.  YUM FOOD.  Went shopping today for my  sister's BirthDay !!!  She is 13 ! How amazing and scary. And if anyone so much as looks at her the wrong way, I'll break their fecking knees.  Eh sometimes I still feel alone and lost. We only get so many chances in life, and how many of them have we given up on?, or how many have been given up for us? I think no two people can love eachother equally, one will always love the other more or less.  I do not think true love felt equally between people can be had.  A Mother will love her child more, or will not love the child at all. One friend will always take advantage over the other. And one lover will always think it's nicer that the other loves them more, and the other will just be so in love as not to notice the un-equality. So there is not equal true love, always the scales will bend this way and that, and no equal hate for that much, but there will always be equal feelings on nutrality but never of strong emotions such as love and hate.So many missed chances, so many chances I was never given. Never was I given the chance when I was willing to take it. These moments of meloncholy piss me the fuck off. Damn thinking Damn it all. Sometimes being stupid seems more like a blessing I woudl rather have.  Sometimes, but then again being a drooling idiot would make me so much more like the idiots I long ago left behind. And why can we not leave all the past behind, something always lurks behind the bends... always. Maybe I'm not the only person to feel upset, infact I know it.  Maybe I am not the only one who was screwed over, and I know I did my fair share of fucking things up myself. The fact that I cheated on more exes than I ever admitted to them, (aside from one pete and my current boy who doesnt count ross) worries me, and the fact I broke them off always, and yet I have this fear of getting cheated on, left and broken up with. I know I was always out to get them before they get me, but they were assholes who ended up doing their fair share also in the end. I feel I've met the first person I trust the most ever, and hence the no problem. I know I have this fear of commitment and this fear of being alone, but I try to deal with those two total oposites, I found someone who I can talk to about anything and just understands me more than anyone, which is amazing.  Life isn't so bad,  DEATH THE HIGH COST OF LIVING ...    Nothing's gonna save me, I can see I can't say I'm fearful, I can't say I'm not afraid But I am not resisting, I can see I don't need a heaven, I don't need religion I am in the place where I should be I am breathing water, You know a body's got to breathe REM Undertow

      Happy Birthday Dave, it was Saturday... OLD MAN!!!  And I went home this weekend for some self searching.  It is amazing how I can't walk around my room without a memory of someone from my past hitting me.  Er, bad use of words.  But since the move I had to go through stuff.  I find notes from eight grade and such, ex crap, photos from my childhood long lost.  And then the piles and piles of crap that I should have thrown out a long time ago.  So I got home and watch  Somethings Gotta Give  with Ross.  It was interesting.  Then we woke up early and started work on The Garden (back breaking work it is).  Man what a pain in the ass. It will look great one done... which will be in a few weeks.  Then hopefully it will live, working on the karma.  It's our project.  Gosh I miss my bed with it's new fluffy matress and the blue color room. No matter how far you run you can never escape the past, damn it.  Ross is a great support of everything that has been happening, just in a bit of a funk or something. To much stress and what not. A relaxing vacation will be great! Can't wait for our cruise. Gonna go meditate now... late.  Harry: I have never lied to you, I have always told you some version of the truth.  Erica Barry: I DO like sex! Harry Sanborn: You certainly do.  Julian Mercer: The woman is really very brilliant, but she cannot hold her liquor. Erica Barry: I like that about me. Harry Sanborn: Me too. [At the same time as Harry]  Julian Mercer: Me too. Erica Barry: If I were writing this, this is where I would write "an awkward moment". Harry Sanborn: Honey, if you were writing this, I'd be DEAD! - Something's Gotta Give

       urlLink  AWESOME MOVIE   Clementine: Joel, I'm not a concept. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.  Joel: I remember that speech really well.  Clementine: I had you pegged, didn't I?  Joel: You had the whole human race pegged.  Clementine: Probably.  Joel: I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   So I've been busy working on the  urlLink VVA  website.  I helped design it and help update it.  As of recent I am the only one who updates it but I do so under Ross's name.  I think it's appreciated, not quite sure.  Sometimes I look back and think how stupid I was to do a certain thing, like why couldn't I see the implications then.  To be used or to just be blind about ANYTHING.  You learn from mistakes, but it seems I keep making the same ones over and over again.  Give people to many chances, or trust.  But that's what you are supposed to do, trust, give, it's some sort of fucked up paradox I exist in. I feel like those cartoon characters or like Neo in the Matrix.  You run one way and some how it brings you full circle to the start, it's not like you circles, you just ran foward and poof the start again.  I as of recent dropped off from reality.  I was so sure of everything and now I am not.  I mean I'm sure but now what?  I'm stuck here, can't move.  In a bad game of chess, I ran out of good moves, the only ones I can see will check me.  I was minus 3 today, that was good.  It's odd how we thinking in more and less, plus and minus all the time.  You need more, need less.  Loose weight, gain wealth.  One giant scale we endlessly try to even out.  Good, bad.  Someone so rich had to loose something to gain that money.  Someone so poor had to gain something by loosing all that wealth.  But that doesn't quite work.  You can never have it all but you sure as hell can loose it, how can life go so off balance?  Eh, BladeRunner's got me all thinking. All we are, Memories. Emotions set us apart from machines, and the memories set us apart from most.  We are only memories, and most die with us. My fish forget's about every minute where it was and swims back around it's tiny bowl it loves so much.  It doesn't like other fish, but they can't remember long enough to know they are lonley.  Is that a blessing or a curse?  A generation of people who are taught to hate themselves.

                  take my poll at:  Would You Date Me?:      htmlGEAR.com        I saw this poll on someone elses blog so I just had to see what people would vote... and I'm bored and tired of looking for a better php code.  I was also viewing the quizzes I took last week and both answers had common grounds... so I'll just post the answers see if u see it. You are Haruko! You love to hit people (mostly with a guitar) and are somewhat insane. You get those mood swings, one minute you'll be angry and the next you're bouncing off the walls. You ran over Naota with a vespa and now you're curious as to the things comming out of his head. You are GIR. You are... completely insane... and, quite possibly, the most lovable creature in the universe. Whether you're screaming and running into things, making soap with bacon, watching mindless television programs, or devouring everything in sight, there's no question about it--you are filthy with cuteness... like a baby... except... metal. (METAL) i miss wsou glory days.... any way, in answer both characters are from cartoons I watch, one on adult swim sat. and the other was on nick but now on dvd.  So watch them they are addictive and it takes time to see what the real meanings are... loves much and be kind...

      OVER WITH FINALS and i was getting so stressed too....  All moved out and awaiting my last year of college! Class of 2005!  I finally had some time to watch FLCL and so I got this idea to take this quiz again... and suprise   You are Haruko! You love to hit people (mostly with a guitar) and are somewhat insane. You get those mood swings, one minute you'll be angry and the next you're bouncing off the walls. You ran over Naota with a vespa and now you're curious as to the things comming out of his head.   urlLink   flcl character quiz     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I love VESPA's so much!  My sister also got the invader zim dvd.  So much fun SO MUCH.   You are GIR. You are... completely insane... and, quite possibly, the most lovable creature in the universe. Whether you're screaming and running into things, making soap with bacon, watching mindless television programs, or devouring everything in sight, there's no question about it--you are filthy with cuteness... like a baby... except... metal.    urlLink   The Greatest, Most Advanced Invader Zim Character Profiling Quiz EVER!!!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   so .. i took another quiz...  I need a new keyboard, the c's dont work no more and random other keys go out.  Yup, way to much food spilling on ths baby... And on that note my ear is horribly infected!!! Great time for my insurance to change. Ah, my sister is growing up, and she now has a xanga, yup I remember those days.  She's thirteen and anything I did she can't do until five years after the age I had done it at.  So... at 13 that would put her at, oh my god she's cloned erin.  But i really do love all my sisters.  in little ways they remind me of myself.  me and all my sisters went though the insane stage of being very little and talking outloud to invisble things and singing... well i think we never grow out of that. shit did i say that? and well M is going through the stage where she curses a whole lot, and so if she's anything like me she will grow out of that at about... whenever she has children. I am glad to be home and I am able to devote more time to art, gardening, wicca and everything else I have been ignoring, mostly myself I think.  So I love you all... I think, and if we haven't talked in a while drop me a line, i really miss you...

      Going through old emails ( avoiding work ) I found what word of the day ( urlLink M-W ) was   for Feb 25th, 2003. It was yips  \YIPS\ (noun) : a state of nervous tension   affecting an athlete (as a golfer) in the performance of a crucial action.    Example sentence: Faced with a critical putt in the final round of the golf tournament, Janet got a bad case of the yips, but she hung onto her concentration and made a birdie.   Did you know? Who first dubbed an athlete's stress under pressure the &quot;yips&quot;? We're not sure. We also can't say for certain if this plural noun has anything to do with the singular &quot;yip,&quot; a word of imitative origin meaning &quot;a short bark (as of a dog).&quot; All we really know is that sportswriters have been using &quot;yips&quot; since 1962 and that it most often appears in golf-related contexts.     Jen had sent it as a reminder of days of old. We used to make a yipping sound during our Earth Science class. We were trying to imitate those aliens on  THE MUPPET SHOW  but it came out to praire dog yips. Good times... Also ran into another thing Jen sent me...  urlLink Secrets Every Woman Keeps from Her Man ... by a Kathryn Eisman (this is a long one). Some of it is true, Some of it isn't. Like the butt or hands thing...but some are scarily true isn't that great!:      1)    My best friend knows everything. She knows all of your vitals -- from the size of your bank account to the size of your other, um, holdings -- and she knows how both compare with those of every other man I've ever dated. I have done a hand-comparison measurement so I can divulge size and girth with a high level of accuracy. When my friend smirks at you knowingly, you are not imagining it. She knows. So just know that she knows, and deal with it. (It's not going to change.) Ask her about me, or chat with her about our relationship, at your own risk. She will tell me. Even -- in fact, especially -- if she promises not to. This is not always a bad thing (e.g., if you happen to be telling her how much you love me). But, in general, remember that she is my confidante first, and yours never.    2)  Just looking at your hands can turn me on.   3)  When you go away, even for a day, I sleep in your favorite old T-shirt because it smells like you.   4)  I'll never tell you exactly how many men I've slept with. No matter how sincere I appeared when I answered your question, chances are I wasn't. As an unscientific guideline, when a woman says she's slept with four men, the real number is actually closer to seven. Her fib is partly intentional (she doesn't want to appear a floozy), but mostly it's sexual amnesia. When a woman wants to pretend an encounter never occurred, she simply scraps the man from her official score sheet. Common excuses that lead to such an omission: The actual sex lasted only a few thrusts; or she was drunk or on the rebound.     5)  I fantasized about being with you at least a dozen times before we actually first got naked.   6)  I still think about my ex-boyfriends and compare them to you. Mostly you win. Sometimes not.   7)  I have Googled your exes.    8)  When I'm falling in love with you, I completely lose my appetite.    9)  My body really isn't naturally this hairless and smooth all over. But I will never allow you to see any indication whatsoever of all the shaving, tweezing, waxing, exfoliating, and moisturizing that gets it this way.    10)  I only appear to have it all together. My true organization (or lack thereof) is revealed in my closet, my makeup bag, my desk files.   11)  I have discovered your porn stash and your frequently visited porn Web sites and think the things that turn you on are hilarious.    12)  When I say, &quot;I'm ready,&quot; I'll need exactly 7 more minutes to get ready. Don't try to cheat the system by showing up 7 minutes later; I will still need an extra 7 minutes.   13)  When I say, &quot;I'll meet you in 15 minutes,&quot; I mean I will leave in 15 minutes, and thus won't actually arrive for at least 30 (but probably more like 40).    14)  You've made me cry more times than you'll ever know.   15)  I obsess about when you're going to call me again. The period of time between our first date and your &quot;Thanks for a great night; when can I see you again?&quot; always seems stretched into slow motion. So don't worry about looking too eager. Call. Even if you only wait until noon the day after, it will feel like a lifetime to me. And don't send me an e-mail unless you want me to put you in the figurative trash can along with your message.   16)  I want you to talk a little dirty.    17)  At the beginning of our relationship, I save all of your voice mails and listen to them (and make my friends listen, too), repeatedly.   18)  I might wear granny underwear and purposely not shave my legs because I like you. As crazy as it sounds, the more I like you, the less likely I am to sleep with you on an early date, because I don't want to sabotage having a &quot;proper&quot; relationship with you. So I just might purposely hunt out the ugliest underwear in my drawer and not shave my legs -- all to prevent myself from getting naked with you too soon. Sometimes I might get a little tipsy or carried away, and this plan will backfire.   19)  I split the cost of my fashion purchases over two or more credit cards, so you don't notice the gargantuan deficit.   20)  I'm constantly testing you. I observe, analyze, and judge every action, word, gesture, e-mail, and facial expression. When I ask you if you want to have a threesome, I don't mean it. If you want me to speak to you again, let alone sleep with you after this conversation, the answer should always be, &quot;Why would I want to sleep with another woman when I have you?&quot;    21)  I check out your butt every time you leave the room.    22)  I need constant indications that you want me around. That's why it's better, for example, to say, &quot;I want you to come away with me for the weekend. Could you come with me?&quot; than to ask, &quot;What are you up to this weekend?&quot;    23)  I love it when you get a little jealous. So if you ever see me flirting in front of you with the waiter, the bus driver, or another guy at a party, know I'm actually flirting with you -- through him.    24)  Even though I may complain that I don't see you enough (or that you work too hard), I find nothing sexier than watching you put on a suit in the morning and rush off to work.  &lt;----no, just like it when u leave me the f*ck alone   25)  I start fights with you because I'm feeling ignored. I'm trying to force emotion out of you. Don't retreat into your cave; just give me what I want: some attention. And never tell me to &quot;calm down,&quot; unless you want to guarantee that I absolutely won't.   26)  Even if I insist on paying or splitting the bill on our first date, I'll think you're cheap if you let me.   27)  I may find your best friend repulsive, but I've fantasized about sleeping with him. Not because I want him, but because I want a piece of a guy who is so close to you. &lt;---haha no....   28)  If I'm going to break up with you, all of my friends know way before you do. I've been talking about it for 2 weeks.   29)  When we do break up, I put all photographs of you and mementos of our relationship in a shoe box and store it in my closet. Just in case I get nostalgic. Just in case you come back.  &lt;---haha it burns pretty colors oh and ebay "consider it asshole tax"   30)  I want you to take control in bed. Yes, I have a successful career, I'm financially independent, I live on my own, and I don't need a man to make me happy (in theory). I still want you to pick me up, carry me to the bedroom, and take without asking. &lt;--- money is good too.... i'm in college!     Well work has to start some time! And I have two portfolios due, one term paper/presentation, one(and only deciding grade) final exam, one final project (yay drawing), and something else. And I've done... NONE OF IT! Hope you enjoyed what I had to erase.... late.

In case you are wondering what paper I can possibly be doing to find this site well it's on digital art and digital museums.  So I happen upon  urlLink THIS .  And you must read the FAQ.  It provided hours of entertainment.  I would get the warranty with it.  My happy moment is that Invader Zim came out last week, but it's sold out! of every hot topic... like wtf.   So, off I go to sleep, a long day of May Day stuff that was put off till now because... well I don't know but it shall be fun!... night

      Okay.. so! (family discretion is strongly advised: as in don't read u really don't want to)  I think people should get over the fact that I broke up with them, especially the people who physically hurt me on numerous ocassions "right now he's saying she deserved it" well you and wife beaters around the world are nodding their heads. And by numerous I mean both hands, and by physical we are talking blood and bruises with scars attached.. just to clarify. I assure you no one in their right mind do what this person did, only psychos, and certainly not the person he pretended to be.. but.. well, he's psycho and no one likes the bastard child.  He really should work on his landscaping advertisment so he can go make enough money to leave me the fuck alone.  so i write yesterday:  wow, people really are bitter when you break up wtih them, even though they beat the crap out of you... boggles my mind why ur still alive. why is it so hard for people who supposivley hate you to stay out of ur life and stop checking up on you? sorry you lose, and really i wish you would actually for once do the things you said you would, like take a "gun to ur head" (said in the message he's not supposed to send me), cuz it would stop your FAT MOUTH FROM TALKING TO ME, ur so full of shit please god please if he hates me so much make him avoid me as much as i avoid him   It was great, for a week not a single message or glance of the piece of shit.  It must have been an off week where he felt that pissing me off would take to much effort.  Needless to say I am happy now and with someone without major mental or erectile dysfunctions.  And on a side note it isn't the size so much as how to use it but when u do not have the size or the know how.. well then... ur my psycho stalker ex who after a year really has to let go.  Lets face it only six months were good and that's because you were faking u werent psycho, the three months after where you werent around were even better!  Hey what he doesn't know, and what I don't know is really what made it so great.  It's nice when people fake that they are nice sincere and care, but you know it fades. So end result I dated a person that never existed, lost a friend i didnt care about and gained ANOTHER psycho ex who wont leave me alone for whatever reason it really is cuz the reason they give is shit.... if you hated me you would avoid me! PLEASE.... ur dumb i trashed you like the garbage you are...   so it's a nice day i'm going out.. and really ur building urself up for a big fall, a much deserved one and one you brought upon ur self....

In order of most Liked:  urlLink Reel Big Fish ,  urlLink Street Light Manifesto , and  urlLink BadFish  (a Sublime Tribute band) I was so happy Reel Big Fish played my fav songs!!!  urlLink  Take On Me  ,  urlLink  Beer   and  urlLink  Where have you Been?   they have most excellent break up songs! And I had a very exhausting weekend and had tons of friggin work to do, but u know me I manage.... and on a side note (song lyrics): You say you need me more than anyone else well go to hell- where have you been? No way! You wish! I don't need this! What makes you think I'd ever want you again? Yeah right! As if! I don't need this What makes you think I'd ever want you again? - Reel Big Fish  to the only break up I have to be bitter about, Dave to you the only guy who ever broke up w/ me EVER, and you did it twice w/ in a month dude!

       Opinion:   urlLink When women bring home the bacon, why is it such a problem for the man to just accept it?  Even now I run into problems people have with that.  I've dated two people and it truly ruined everything because they were insecure that I had more money than them. It makes no sense to me why a woman is put down when she is successful! I don't even have an actual job yet, so what's the deal? You should be happy for your partner that they are doing well and support them in whatever they do, regardless if it makes money or not. It's always okay if your a struggling artist, but a female successful artist will have trouble finding a man because of their stupid insecurities. If you let money ruin your love you will never find actual happiness. And I have found the best quote from  urlLink South Park :  "Love isn't a decision. It's a feeling. If we could choose who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical."  -Mr. Twig   urlLink How to Travel Like a Billionare  I found this article to be very cool! A day after I found  urlLink Sky Jet . I would love to travel like this and would probably be the only way I will get on a plane in the near future aside from going to a hypnotise.   Personal:  Recently I have been having the best time! Cirque du Soeil was excellent! I love the  urlLink Aerial Act , they were so hot!!! I also found the restaurant we ate at ( urlLink Da Ciro ! Everything that day was just great, except for the horrible cuts on my foot my great looking sandals made. But damn I looked good! We even have  urlLink pictures !  I also went  urlLink hiking  with Ross yesterday. We had a picnic by the water fall and got lost, but it was just such a nice day and so beautiful there we didn't much care. When we got back Ross bought me  urlLink Gerbera Daisies , my second favorite flower! It is actually equal to Roses, it depends on the season and these were just to nice to pass up! Such vibrant colors they just scream happy!  Soon we will be going to OBX (Outter Banks, NC).  My Uncle Rob has a count down on  urlLink his site ! From today it is 58 Days!!! Everyone is on a diet to look great on that beach, but we will still be that pale white family you see. Can't change genetics... but who cares I will be in OBX and you won't!  The poll is still out  urlLink Would You Date Me?  I have added a few answers to it so that it's funnier to me! So cast your vote!  Well back to the usual now that I am done babysitting. Looking forward to July 4th, that firework festival of explosions! Not looking forward to summer classes and summer work. But I get super student next semester! Yay me. I think it has something to do with the fact I am the only person who has worked there over a semester! But who cares! YAY ME!!! I get tuition paid with it and well I also did excellent last semester grade wise, 2 A's and 3 B's. Although I think one of those B's should be an A I did great considering the jerks off professors I had for most of the semester. Hope this new thing won't kill me or my grades. My problem with this job is I care to much about the computer problems there for personalizing them and driving myself crazy with things I can't fix. But I still like it and you can not beat the 5 minute commute.   My Job is:  Student computer aids are available during their work hours to help students and faculty with basic computer needs. In addition, they will be monitoring computer labs and learning about software and hardware.  Computer aids are Macintosh friendly, have a good attitude, and are comfortable assisting faculty. Basic video, audio, and troubleshooting will be learned and used to help students and faculty. -Work extra hours (up to 20) -Handle extra responsibilities -Know MORE technically about all of the labs we support -Be a ÂleaderÂ among lab assistants -Supervise overall facilities as far as locking down, closing out, etc. when necessary -Be available to other student aides and instructors for help with troubleshooting

       Usual:  I got to see Ross again this week! I finally got him his model Plymouth RoadRunner, his favorite car EVER! And I got my gift. A white gold necklace and Opal pendent with a cute little diamond on top and a design on the side. It is very delicate and elegant but is also good for every day wear, well cuz I want to! It is my first Opal necklace and it is very beautiful. Seeing  urlLink Cirque du Soleil  this weekend and going to this great reasturant on the west side! If you ever have seen the  urlLink south park episode  where they make fun of this event, well it's hilarious! But still I like going and this will be my Fourth ever show of Cirque du Soleil. Ross wouldn't be caught dead there, something about it sucking, but my sister mel really wants to go so I'm bringing her next time!  Naota:  When you're in a town like this all covered with smoke, you forget that there's a world outside. Nothing amazing happens here. And you get used to that, used to a world where everything is ordinary. Every day we spend here is like a whole lifetime of dying slowly. But now Haruko is here. That's how I know there really is a world outside.  urlLink -flcl  Ross, my only hope out of here. My Haruko...   Darkness:  It suddenly struck me that from that day my life has stopped. Everything keeps moving but life for me has stood still. I try desperatley to make it move again but it won't budge. I guess when you are moving so fast so high you have to come down some time, but man how do I get myself back up? Wake me from this horrible nightmare. "Anxious to get the pavement moving. Happiness is not having, to lie on the floor... dead... alone..." - poison the well  'meeting again for the first time'  Is it possible for a person to be comparable to a drug? That's what it feels like... you were.

      First off CONGRATS UNCLE ROB AND CAROL on the ENGAGMENT!!! We are so happy for you both!!!  So.... Congrat's Wei on graduating, to bad we missed you in hoboken! Jen, Crystal, Chris P. and I all went bar hoping Sat. night in hoboken.  Very good times and I can't wait to do it again next weekend! Also went to Morristown bars with Jen and Ariel on Friday.  It's a little more toned down but try telling the people that! It's creepy cuz my mom used to go to Jimmies Haunt, so I avoid that one like the plauge!  Surpringly people were more dressed up in Morristown than Hobken, usually it's quite the opposite.  But damn I looked good. Also celebrated Mine and Ross's anniversary!  We BBQed and he made cake and fondue for me!  We also exchanged gifts! I got him a wallet and he got me earrings and a necklace!  I also got him something else but it hasen't come in yet :(. It's the gift that Russ said I was such a good girlfriend for :-D.  How sweet!  I am really missing my METAL days.  I love listening to the stuff and have dreams of ROCKSTARdum but the problem is I can't sing well and I do not play any kind of instrument!... so I can always be like Courtney Love! I just play PANTERA all day and hope that by dreaming my dreams will actually become reality.  Besides I look hot in leather!!!   urlLink ps i wish you to still take my poll if you havent

      First thing is first! Russ also has a Birthday this month on the 25th, Happy Birthday Secret Admirer.  So yesterday was Mine and Ross's 6month anniversary!!! It is a short period of time but we really have known each other for 9months.  He took a while asking me out.  We have had our ups and downs, mostly I had downs and he helped me back up. He is the only boyfriend I ever had that my whole family has liked! In fact the only one my family  has really liked at all.  And I am also welcomed by his family.  And he is the only person who puts up with my insane ideas, in fact he helps me along!  He truly understands me like no one else does, and I get him.  He makes me laugh even when I am very upset or mad.  He goes to the end of the earth and back for me and treats me like the wonderful woman I am.  And I try my darnedest to treat him as great as he treats me.  He's cute and TALL and has beautiful eyes like dusk. He listens to me go on and on describing things and how I see them (the artist in me likes doing that).  I call him my imaginary friends cuz sometimes I swear he is so perfect and complimentary to me that he must be in my brain. I've asked Crystal many times if he is really next to me (kiddingly).  But he is real and is mine.  I can't believe I found someone so perfect.  And I always forget that he's three and a half years younger than me!  He acts older and more together than ANY boyfriend I've ever had.  And he will be the man I marry! (I really really think and hope) So it's a short period of time but it will grow to surpass all time and space!!! We are just that great together. Not to say he hasn't had his downs and his time in the hospital, but I like to think of him as invincible... oh and as a senator!

      Well nothing interesting really this week.  I had a great week/end with my Ross.  You know the better things are the less I write.  I had one of those weeks where it pains me to be without Ross and when I'm with him I just can't stop smiling or that feeling you get in your chest when you think it's gonna burst with excitment and feelings. No one wants to ever hear the good things, just the drama and sad depressing shit. It will come to me don't worry, unfortunatley I really wish it wouldn't.   It's really busy this month with birthdays:  Happy Birthday Dad, Brigid, Jacquie, Rachel, Rachel E., my friend Russ and oh yeah Happy Father's Day John and Dad and my two Grandfather's...

      So... finaly some time away from the rugrats to write!   Memorial Day Weekend , I only really had one day that was great and well it wasn't the actual Memorial Day.  Friday ... saw  urlLink Troy  after dropping off the rugrats.  Great movie, made for females, not a single boob but you see as much of a naked many you can see at a rated R flick, oh and BRAD PITT!  Orlando was cute too.  They didn't even bother following the original story line, but who cares BRAD PITT, and it was still pretty cool.  Saturday ... went down to see Crystal at the shore.  Took the train and now I'm in love with any station beginging with R on the  urlLink NJ Transit , this includes Rahway where I left from.  I was there in an hour and a half, and ever sucker on the parkway and turnpike had to wait 3hours to get to Red Bank.  So  we went to  urlLink Headliners  after chilling around town.  It was great, but very different from off season (duh).  Very nyc crown there, and man it was crowded.  I remember people stepping on my feet but the huge bruise on my foot must have happened after I had the mind earaser.  All those red bulls and V (5) made me very energetic, but we had a blast dancing.  And so many men, so many looked the same and were UGLY, but the ones I liked I was dragged away from by Crystal (thankfully).  I was asking all of them if they liked the band TOOL, trying to prove there are quality men (in my eyes) at a club (some stuttering involved)...  Sunday ... woke up way to friggin early (10) to come home to go pick up furnture and go to a heated pool party (it was chilly).  BUT the truck BLEW A TIRE OUT after just getting to the mall.  LUCKILY we didn't die, but Ross went with the tow truck to get it back to Succusunna (thank god for AAA plus).  Well the truck starts to head back (where I was waiting for it) and the TOW TRUCK breaks down half way to the tire place. So they wait for another tow truck.  After an hour they just head back with an over heating tow truck w/ a truck on the back.  They get there and take an hour changing trucks, my Mom hears this and since she was in the area she heads to the tow place to save Ross, and to chew out some DeFalco idiots.  The truck broke at Two and was towed at 2:30pn, it was now 8:00pm all the while Ross is w/ the truck and I'm waiting for him and the truck.   FINALLY  my Mom and John bring Ross home at 9pm and we eat, the TRUCK gets tot he tire place at 10PM, EIGHT HOURS LATER. All the while my dad is chewing me out for reasons unknown, we are lucky to be alive and its not my fault he has crappy tires!!! Thus ruining my Sunday Plans...  Monday ... it rained I rested, all is right in the world...   So  now back to rugrats... late

        Opinion:  I was talking to Ross and some how I got into philosiphizing on relationships.  I started going into the difference between dating and marriage relationships.  Not so much the writing in laws, but the actual interaction between the two people. Dating seems like its a go to thing.  You don't live with the person and to be together you have to "go see" eachother.  Marriage like relationships are a go from thing.  You spend all this time with a person and the only time you are away from the person is when you phisycally "go from" that person, such as work or go hang out with same sex night (girls/boys night).  And I told him we have a dating relationship, we call eachother and have to go to eachother.  But during the school year we have more of a marriage relationship, not married, but only in eyes of law.  It's not fair to place so much emphasis on legal bindings when it really is only a religious thing that only some people can partake in.  And then there are those that are married who are not really married, it's more like dating with the law on their side. And that is my analysis.  Luckily Ross and I can adapt easily to both so this school, summer thing doesn't suck.  It is a little more lonley but i figure it's only temprary.  Personal:  So roommate problems.  It's only been a few weeks and they are pissing me off, well only the two actually.  I don't care if they party or anything, but they are anti-social and rude all the time.  So last night they have their sisters over and they are drinking late, and I was up, that was not the problem... The problem was that they were drinking and being loud, and drinking is prohibitted, but so if security comes we are fucked.  And if we leave the shit out, we get in trouble, which guess what they never cleaned up.  Turns out one went to the hospital, but well this is nothing new this not cleaning up.  It's just very inconsiderate, but I have only one more week... so I don't care. I only hate feeling like shit the last week of summer classes.  I got drugs and chilis so hopefully tomorrow won't suck as bad.  It just stinks not being "with it" at work and class.  But I get to see Ross soon and I will be so happy, oh yeah and I better feel better in time for the wedding or else it will not be so fun.

       Personal:  Um... putting off my midterm right now but hey, that's just me.   This weekend...   Friday:  I actually played with my mac all day. Pretty sad but somewhere deep inside is a digital artist waiting to get her hands on some new technology.  Saturday : Went down to see Ross.  He made me French Onion Soup Alton Brown style. It was really sweet of him. He also picked up my full box portable easel. It really is beautiful.  And I almost cried when I saw he wrote a Van Gogh quote on the case. No not because he wrote on it, but it was incredibly sweet and romantic.  Then I made plans to meet up with Crystal and Friends to celebrate her B-Day at The Breakfast Club. I thought I was leaving Ross figuring he couldn't possibly want to do something at 11pm. I was wrong; he wanted to go to Newark to this Portuguese Bakery (Crissy ruined me). He didn't tell me and I found this all out the next day after coming home quiet plastered. It was a cute club, played 80's 90's music and would have been even better if a few people I hate didn't find me there (wtf). Crystal seemed to have fun so it was very cool.  Sunday:  Hangover what? Spent some time with Ross and then went on home to show my Mac to the father rents. And of course Six Feet Under....  This coming weekend is Dad and Diana's wedding. I wish them luck and happiness even though they don't want me to go to Florida with them. (grrr) Back to staring at a blank word doc....  Anyone will do tonight  Close your eyes, just settle, settle  Anyone will do tonight  I got a bad feeling about this (to hell with you and all your friends, it's on).  I'm coming over but it never was enough  I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you Well I got a bad feeling about this  - Taking Back Sunday  I'll hate to think I ever settle on anything or anyone... I deserve happiness like anyone else, and I'm gonna get whats best for me and that's that.

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY CRYSTAL!!!     Opinion:    So finally an article on women making more $ than men that makes sense.&nbsp; No we do not need other peoples materialistic support, we need emotional support.&nbsp; So what a man can not support you financially, he can still be there for you emotionally and hopefully intellectually.    Personal:    So where have I been? Got my G4 finally with some difficulty.&nbsp; The apple loan place was being a pain in my you know what.&nbsp; But I recieved it finally.&nbsp; I am not online because our home wireless router is acting all bitchy and not sending any connections out sometimes even to the computer that is directly connected.&nbsp; So I have to call about three different tech supports every day and well....   But my computer is totally cool! It works just great and cost a great amount.&nbsp; Oh well you win some you loose some.   Going to see Ross today and then to the shore to chill with Crystal on her B-Day, all via train of course. I just hate shore traffic.   I've been taking a Environmental History course and have been quite busy with it.&nbsp; Every Wed we go on a field trip some place.&nbsp; Last week was Torne Valley's superfund site.&nbsp; Mind you that does not say super fun.&nbsp; It was hot and the wind picked up just right for all of us to wif the lovley smells.&nbsp; And oh the toxic waste.&nbsp; It really makes you realize you're killing this world and at the same time urself.&nbsp; Most of our other trips are lovely walks in parks and such.&nbsp; Which reminds me I have an extra credit and midterm to do! Opps!   Work has also been keeping me mad busy.&nbsp; I get home at the end of the day and want to kill every apple I see.&nbsp; But I do get paid, and I do enjoy the people I work with.   The garden Ross and I have is going great.&nbsp; We have a billion acorn squashes and some strawberries and bellpeppers.&nbsp; I call Ross Thoreau, he likes that.   Speaking of Ross got me a full box portable easel.&nbsp; I think it's great how I get support from him and my friends and family for my art work.&nbsp; I am still finding my artistic nitche but atleast I have people around me encouraging me.   I am all set for outter banks now and&nbsp;can't wait for the beach!&nbsp; I might go to our Florida house soon but that has yet to be seen.... anyone up for roadtripping with me?   Well I feel I'm spending to much time indoors on this sunny day so I am going out!

       Life:  Classes started Tuesday and without my computer I have not been online at all. I don't work that much and class is really fun. We went on this very intense hike on Wednesday and saw and Indian Rock shelter and an older Miners Furnace. So after work on Thursday I jetted down to Ross's (I get Fridays off). And had lobster two days in a row! I love that stuff. Ross even made me hush puppies. So I continue to work out all the time and chill with my friends. Just been busy getting my life back is all. I would also like to announce the arrival of my Mac Power Book LapTop! It is my baby and I pick it up today! YAY. I enter the  urlLink  Mac World  .  On my other hand, this is the third night in a row I have had really disturbing dreams. In fact whenever I am around Ross I get them, maybe he keeps me in tune with my subconcious. One is a continuation where I dream of the love of my life. As good as that sounds, if you know who that was then you know my dilema. He's gone. I would love to dream about the man I will marry and whom I love very much, but instead I still get haunted in my dreams of someone else. Second is sort of a continuing theme. The albino snake. But unlike last time this one looked like a cobra and in parts was almost translucent. Mom and I went for a job interview with John for a Basket Ball Coach job. John looked at the snake and accidentally let it escape. The owner (the man giving the interview) said it was fine and smiled. John was bit in the leg first and left Mom and I to go to the hostpital. Then I was bit in the legs three times, but I did not notice the third till I was at the hospital. My Mom noticed hers when I described that the snake bite did not hurt really, hers was on her toe. And then I woke up. Like the last one of the albino snake I could not fight it off or stop it and was bit. But this time each family memeber was bitten also and in the legs of all places. Not sure what it means but this theme bothers me every time. A friend suggested it might mean purity (the white) but then why would it be so evil?

       Opinion:  Finally NASA's use of our money is paying off with the new  urlLink Saturn Studies . Unlike when they landed in Arizona (Mars), these photos actually show us a better view of Saturn and will help us actually learn things about this very cool looking planet.  I also think for July 4th we should bring Bush Jr. on charges for war crimes he committed this way we show a fair justice system. It will be a celebration of independence from such a tyrant who came into office so unwelcomly. I think his plan on how to pay for all this is owed to us before election time, instead of him bribing us to vote for him again. I figure he got us stuck here he's gonna go to hell.   Personal:  Going to make sure the lyme disease is out of my system. Also going to fight this fine I got unfairly from school. My chair came stained, it was no big deal, but now I get fined $35 for the thing! I don't know why because they will not replace the chair, but they want to take more money from me. I really truly hate Ramapo College's useless Residence Life. They truly only want to make life for everyone difficult and we should soon phase out security with state troopers like other state colleges. This way instead of busting white people for parties they will have a non-biased busting of parties and will spend more time on drug busts because well they are a bigger deal than 21 year olds drinking in their wet apartments. I like all of two security people, and that is it! The rest are biased assholes who do not do actual jobs, they crash campus cars and get US to pay for it with out THEM getting fired or reprimanded at all. So interesting morning I am off to go wait in line for 2hours so that they an take my blood in 2minutes. Bravo!

       General:  		 So latest breaking news on BBC was  US governor quits over gay affair . Pretty intense.  Sucks for his wife, he cheats and its on someone who isn't even the same gender as her.  Cheating is cheating though, but his sexual orientation and well the fact he cheated on his wife has nothing to do with his position as governor. He came out and told the truth, a hard thing to admit when your a politician.  But if I was his wife I might be a little ticked off, and would hope he didn't bring any insects into the relationship. Eww stds.  		 And you know I was busy at work today when the last 20minutes was spent looking at this  slightly disturbing and funny site .  You tell the chicken to do things and it does them, it is a pretty cool program.  But the commercials are the disturbing parts.  		     especially this one.... but hey it's funny to. I feel a little violated on the inside.  But finally fast food directed towards adults.  Another advertising campaign I wish I came up with... damn it. I'll have to remember this trick....hmmm.    Personal:  Well sorta glad I'm not in Florida.  We live in Flagler and I just hope my family and sisters are safe when they go there.  I guess that's the risk you take during huricane season. But more on that later....    What's this quote from?  Don't talk of love but i've heard the word before It's sleeping in my memory I won't disturb the slumber of the feelings that have died If i never loved I never would have cried CeiN StarZ (2:06:34 PM): Don't talk of love but i've heard the word before It's sleeping in my memory I won't disturb the slumber of the feelings that have died If i never loved I never would have cried   I love you Sweet Leaf  When I first met you, didn't realize I can't forget you, for your surprise you introduced me, to my mind And left me wanting, you and your kind  I love you, Oh you know it  My life was empty, forever on a down Until you took me, showed me around My life is free now, my life is clear I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear  Come on now, try it out  Straight people don't know, what you're about They put you down and shut you out you gave to me a new belief and soon the world will love you sweet leaf  Black Sabbath

       Assesment:  So it's pretty late to be up, and I hear this noise at the window, a sort of buzzing of a big bugs wings.  This goes on for five minutes and I'm like wtf, so I close the window to make it go away. But I accidentally closed the thing in the window!  It's dark out and of course once again, late, so I say f-it and just go to sleep.  In the morning I still hear the thing every now and then buzzing it's wings.  So I open the window and there it is in the daylight, a huge locus.  Gross right, and now I feel bad because if I haden't locked it in there then the small spider and it's web wouldn't have gotten it.  By mornign it was making it's last cries for help, and I tried to help but it was to late, I had already sealed it's fate. Sad, but what does that say about life?   Personal:  Today was pretty shitty. It started pouring on my way back and the umbrella I had must have been to small, I was soaked from my knees down.  Stupid slanty rian. And then Russ and I decided to cancell due to the crappy weather, so I went out and did errands instead!  Also met up with Dave later on.  We went to Montclair's Eclectic Cafe, I haven't been there in atleast a year.  It was cool except for the annoying teens, waited a half hour to get seated and it was kareoke night, except these people were SOBER!  One guy started singing to friggin System of a Down, I was like wow, thats pathetic and sad all at once.  But I had really good coffee and gelato, and of course interesting catch up converstion with Dave.  Haven't really seen him since he got home from Europe, and by haven't really seen I mean at all. Called Ross when I got back (and I wanted to go to bed early!).  Trying to get plans together for this coming weekend.  Supposed to go to the city tomorrow and then hoboken friday, maybe even shore saturday.  But of course this is all weather permitting, it's no fun being drunk in the rain and then driving home a little buzzed.   Some good quotes:  Yo I blaze the ill'est - stagga lee every time i hear that song, i dont take it seriously becasuse....dude, he did barmitzvahs -qualm  I feel sorry for people who dont drink, when they wake up in the morning, thats as good as they're going to feel all day. - Sinatra

       Personal: Well the peach festival sucked! Never go there. It wasn't a peach festival at all, just an auction and such. So we went shopping and go some cute things. Found a great bird bath for $25, it was adorable. Finally got some landscaping done on the house, it looks great! We had my Aunt AnneMarie over for dinner and we got some great cheeses and wines not to mention bread at the  urlLink Artisan Gary's MarketPlace  in Chester. Such good cheese it's dangerous! It was nice to have my Grandmother come visit. She had fun, and we all celebrated John's B-day on sunday, I made  urlLink Pata Choux , and then made that into Eclairs, John's faveorite. Also got him  urlLink Doom3  which is supposed to be good. Then today I stopped by to see Ross and have dinner w/ my mom and grandmother. Dinner was okay, but the  urlLink white caslte  we (Ross John >Ross's friend   urlLink  Awesome this finally came out!!!       Quotes:  "You know what I'm saying" - "Thats because I speak Erinese" "I have been mistaken for portuguese" - "Well never dated that nationality before, or dutch or german, YOU WIN" "What causes us to build walls around our hearts?"   FORTUNE:  Love or Fame, you'll be able to handle either or both - my fortune A Liar is not believed even though he tells the truth... - proverb

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY PETE!!!    Personal:  Ross now has a new nickname for me, it's ooB.  It's Boo backwards and since  he doesn't want to call me something non-orignal he came up with that. I thought it was cute. And well as of recently I can't stop buying books! It's crazy, Barnes and Noble loves me, even if it is only for the money. In every relationship it gets to a point where it may end; so one person pulls away and the other holds on tighter. Instead of giving space the opposite effect happens leading to a disaster in the end.  It seems there is a winner and looser even in relationships, I would like to keep my winning streak going. Your move. I like to think there is an ultimate balance, and my balance will come back to me soon. I just hope it lasts a bit longer this time This is a really good quote from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  It is a pretty odd show and takes a certain mind set to understand, luckily I have that extreme mindset! -do you see what i'm talking about?! -no I don't but I'm sure it will get you arrested  Long nights, longer days... all this time, really busy, and yet I don't really know what I do... hmmm I needed a change so I hoped the next train to Colonia, that was nice, and then stayed up all night doing the paper I didn't do all week.  Then work, class and home to see my sisters. I made all of my siblings cds on my new PowerBook G4, Jacquie was so cute she put on her head phones and sung "Hey Jude".   It was that childhood innocence that was so endering.  She's actually pretty good. I found out today I can't go to Florida with them.  It pisses me off cuz the only way I can go is if i bring Ross. I can't drive by msyelf that long, and I'm not allowed to bring ne one but Ross. I think my Dad and Diana like Ross more than me. So its been a few weeks since a binge of drinking...  Funny thing about AA meetings.  You go, they all talk about God (even though it's not religous supposedly) and they all drink coffee and smoke, exchanging drinking for smoking and what not.  Most turn to fundamentalists, or just go back to drinking to shut them all up about God.  There should be a better system not based on a religion.  But you know... it makes for good books (Fight Club, Choke).  Sex addicts have an even more interesting way of dealing, but that is another blog....  So off I go, my Grandma Nikki is visiting and we are going to the Peach Festival and then Johns B-Day....  If I could fix my self I would.... But it's to late for me ::nin::

       Movie: I,Robot  Will Smith is a better actor than they give credit to, and deffintley hot.  He has the nicest eyes, great shape and color, just beautiful. So I go off on a rant. One of my favorite Biblical stories is of the Tower of Babel. Babel: We try to build a tower to reach God, and thus gain all his power and knowledge.  But he strikes down the tower and creates different languages so that we could not communicate to build such a thing again. I,Robot: Tallest building, find knowledge of God like comparison, struck down. Bible: Jesus, Judas, Mary Magdeline I,Robot: (spoiler) Dr. kills himself to enlighten the rest, like Jesus. Sunny, does the killing ultimatley and fufills a profecy so that said dr. is killed to profide us with enlightenment.   Spooner is Paul, denies the Dr. three times before accepting it.  Chick he is with Mary Magdaline.... So that is my in depth analysis thus far.  There is also some cyberpunk relation in the beginging and I am sure the book goes into it much more, but it was very cool.  As your God as my witness - Futurama

       Opinion:  There are right now, on campus, five different construction projects. 1. New Recreational Area (GYM) 2. Mansion 3. Cafe Express (second year they are re-doing the facilities we all use) 4. H Wing Lecture Hall 5. Outlook Housing  Most of these projects are on their second year.  Non of them will have been finished at their projected time, or within the projected semester, or year. Somebodys relatives are getting paid very well for doing these jobs and it sucks because it is an inconvience I am paying for.  I would like to see the gym, they have been doing that for three years, before I end my fifth year here.  So we have no facilities to work out in, and then the eating.  We have had all but one semester with all our cafeterias open in my five years here.  The mansion is being changed for reasons unknown.  Lecture hall would be nice thank you for removing the asbestos, or so we hope.  And outlook, another housing project that was supposed to be sustainalbe but do to the purposefull slow progression it will no longer be that way, in fact we are lucky if the 300 students that are moving in to part of the building will have housing, lets hope.  Lets not even start on the fact that this seven floor building has only two elevators (oak and maple have only two, that never work and they are only 4 floors i see a coming problem morons).   Personal:  My Dad and Diana were married this Friday, Congratulations!  It was a very nice small ceremony and the reception was great.  I was glad to be able to see my family all together again.  My Aunt Goo has not been able to attend a family function in over a year and finally she was able to take off to be with us.  And even the weather was nice, despite the forcast for rainy skies. Now I must go back to work and then finish my very long and boring term paper... yay
