      Back from my family trip. Everything there was pretty uneventful, which is the norm for the upstate relations. I left Saturday morning, expecting to get on the 9:51 train to Poughkeepsie. And I woulda made it, too, if it hadn't been for the amazing brilliance of the MTA. They decided to do construction on subway lines over the holiday weekend. So, halfway into the city, the train stops and the passengers are told they must disembark, as that train will be going no further. A door problem and a transfer later, I am at Grand Central. It is 10:15. I end up taking the 10:51 into Poughkeepsie with no further problems.   Grandma and Great-Aunt Freda pick me up at the station. What a pair, those two! Without getting too much into it, I'll just tell you that some people should not be enclosed in a moving vehicle together. Fights that ensued in the 24 hour time period I was with them include such great topics such as why one used so much of her maple syrup on her waffle and who felt dizziest when they stood up. Oy-vey!!  One upshot to hangin' with the Old Ladies is that I got taken to the movies. We saw "Raising Helen," which I can say that I was highly impressed with, despite the fact that I am not all that much of a Kate Hudson fan. Even (or should I say, "especially") with all the "whaddya ya mean, move to Queens?" comments, this particular bridge-and-tunnel girl was quite amused. (To top it off, she lives in a neighborhood that is close by, so seeing it would give you a representation of where I live.)  From there, I went to my cousin Dawn's and had much barbecue fare. Yum. Ended by seeing all 3 hours of the last Lord of the Rings movie. Have to say I think it woulda made more sense if I'd seen the second one.   This morning I went with Dawn, her three kids and my Aunt Sandy to the Red Hook Memorial Day parade. Cute and picturesque. And mercifully short, even though I swear any kid in a 5 town radius who had some sort of uniform - be it Boy Scout, baseball, soccer, basketball, cheerleader or whatever - walked past me, smiling and waving.   About 30 seconds after the last float went past (the third nursery school class being pulled on a hayride) Aunt Sandy and I took off to start my return journey to the city. Because of parade detours, we ended up missing my first departure time, but then decided that hour would be better spent having cake and coffee rather than idly waiting on the platform. (Aunt Sandy has the most fantastic ideas, don't you agree?) A scrumptious piece of cheesecake later, we were on the way again.   We pulled into the station 5 minutes after the train had pulled out. Oh well, so I did end up sitting for an hour on the platform. But really, that turned out okay. I ended up talking with a young MTA electrician (John) for nearly 45 minutes. Verrry cute. I would say "Ben Affleck"-ish, even down to the adorable cleft chin. He's just hired a realtor to help him find a place in Astoria. I'll let ya'll know if he calls me...since I, for the first time ever, boldly gave him my number on the back of the library receipt stuck in my book. (Although, for the record, he approached me and started the conversation...)  I am now home, preparing for the workweek and giving my kittens extra attention from the days I was gone.   I did finish  The Life of Pi , which was really interesting at times, but I didn't find it quite lived up to all the hype. A lot of it is like reading a script you might find on Animal Planet. Very graphic literary images of animals being ripped apart. Eewww. Also a lot of description about the boat itself and where he is in it. I, personally, had a hard time picturing the situation, and I found all of the nautical description a little boring. But, it's a huge bestseller, so I leave it to you to decide whether or not to read it for yourselves.   Only 3 more weeks until I start summer training for NYCTF!

      Got news today that is both exciting and a tremendous relief. About a month ago I spent an entire Saturday slogging through 2 different exams, the Content Specialty Test (CST) in English and the Liberal Arts and Sciences Test (LAST). Both are necessary for my teaching certification. Today, I got my results, and am happy to say I   PASSED BOTH!!!  In other day-to-day stuff, I spent some time at the library last night. I cannot even tell ya'll how much I loooove the  urlLink library . (Did you notice that? I'm learning how to insert links already! Aren't you impressed?) Anyway, I finally got my mitts on a copy of  The Da Vinci Code . Wanna know if it was good? Does the fact that I started it last night around 9 and have already finished it answer that? Will I tell you the end? Of course not. Be assured, it is a fantastic read. Highly recommended! I came home with some more books from my time spent "shopping" at the library, and am planning on starting The  Life of Pi  tomorrow when I get on the train.   The train (Metro North) is a fantastic form of transportation. I love going on the train. The tracks are just alongside the Hudson River, so it's a very scenic ride. I am going to visit my family upstate in Poughkeepsie (for Texans, that's pronounced Puh-kip-see). From Grand Central Station it takes about 2 hours to get there. I'm planning to stay until Monday morning, and since I'm gonna be hangin' with Grandma, I figured I needed a heavy artillery of reading material. Among other selections that will be stashed in my suitcase are Simone De Beavoir's  All Men Are Mortal  and the purposely-not-as-heavy chic lit  Good Grief . Reviews to follow. I would be really interested in having you comments on what you are reading now, or if you've read one of these titles already, what you think.   In other news, today's my Mamma's birthday and tomorrow is Pantene Princess Jenny's special day. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  So, you'll hear more from me after I return from what promises to be an interesting weekend of "quality family time".

      Okay, so I've actually been thinking about starting my own Blog for a while now, especially since so many of my friends are geographically far away. However, what really pushed me to finally do it was a conversation I had with a friend from Texas about two weeks ago. It made me realize that I am about to reinvent myself (again) and it would be an interesting thing to chronicle this journey from the beginning.   Soooo, what's a girl to do when she decides to move her life in an entirely new direction? That's right, get a new haircut! So, wanting to have my newly found direction benefit others, I went out last week and donated most of the length of my hair (over 12 inches) to a charity called Locks of Love, which makes and distributes wigs for children who have no hair due to illness. Pictures to be posted..eventually. So far, short hair is really nice. New York is just starting to get hot and sticky, and this is making it much more tolerable.  Shoutouts...congrats to AmyKatPat, who earned her Master's degree last week. You're awesome, and I'm so proud of you! Holly, I am so glad you have free airline miles, and I'll see you in July!  In other life news...I find out the scores for my teacher certification exams on Friday and my university assignment through the Fellows program in roughly two weeks. And since the New York City Teaching Fellows program will be what I eat, sleep and breathe from this point forward, I have no other information to relay.

      Went to a job fair tonight. Results were pretty good, I think. I got 3, count 'em, 3,  follow up interview offers. All 3 are jr. high, so I'd be teaching 7th or 8th grade, but 2 of the 3 want to not only utilize my English degree, but also my Performance Studies. One school is an arts academy, the other needs a coach for their speech club. Whee! I am so excited by the idea that I could have a solid placement in the next few weeks!  Holly, I am really looking forward to your visit. Can't wait to show you around the neighborhood, and maybe, if things go well, my classroom!

      School got much better Thursday. We had Friday off because many Fellows were signed up to take their exams first thing Saturday morning.  I went to the head of the college section of the Fellows program, and she gave me a little sticker that gave me permission to use the library if I should need to before our regular ID cards get distributed. She also pulled my Educational Psych prof aside and explained the whole ID/stipend/computer situation to him. He has now agreed to have a copy of our text put on reserve in the library and will be bringing copies of the handouts to us who don't have the ability to print out items without paying (like an internet cafe).  Sarah and I spent much of today walking 5th Avenue. She is looking for a part time job while she is waiting to be placed as a temp. We went all over, which was pretty fun.  Tomorrow, we are planning to go to church, then to pick up tickets to Shakespeare in the Park, where they are performing Much Ado About Nothing. Yay!  I also booked a ticket to come home next weekend. It was not the schedule I wanted, as I will be flying back out to NY early Monday morning, rather than late in the evening. However, such is expected with airlines in general, and I am hoping to do as much as possible in terms of dealing with what is happening to Mom while I am home.I wish that I would be able to have time to see all ya'll, but that doesn't look like a possibility. I do look forward to August, when I will be able to stay nearly a month, and hope that I'll be able to make plans with you then!  Mom seems to be doing all right, all things considered, and I am anxious to get home to spend time with her and try to prepare for what awaits us as a family.  Everyone has been wonderfully supportive, and I am very appreciative of that. I know that I have a huge challenge ahead, and I would like to ask a bigger favor of all of you. I have a tendency to "crash and burn" when I get depressed, and once my mom has gone, I am really afraid that I might do that. To try to avert that situation, my wish is that in the year after my mom passes away, that one person will come visit with me each month to help me keep from falling apart. I realize that this is a lot to ask, but if you're willing, please send me an email, so I can have that list handy when the time warrants.  Besides that, the kitties are great, and love Auntie Sarah, who will be kitty-sitting while I'm away next weekend.   Much love to all!

      Argh. I am so frustrated. I knew that doing the program was going to be a challenge, but some things are simply ridiculous!   The Fellows program is this bizarre network of institutions that claim to be working together to put us into classrooms in the fall. So, technically, as of now, I'm a  non-matriculated  grad student of Queens College,(my matriculation status somehow magically changes in the fall) which is separate from the Fellows, which is then separate from the state and city of New York and their subsequent regulations and procedures.   Therefore, I have to ask UMHB for yet ANOTHER transcript, because the state needs it to process my request for certification, and the other 4 I've already gotten were distributed into the Fellows never-never land of paperwork. Somehow, after several years of this program, they haven't added that to the pre-coursework part of the required papers asked of us.   My Educational Psych prof doesn't understand that we don't get our first stipend check until July, and therefore, it makes it difficult to pay for books. And that since we aren't matriculated, we don't yet qualify for a valid student ID from QC and therefore can't use the library or internet labs. (Somehow, the same ID  is  accepted to allow those who have cars to pay the $90 parking fee and get a permit.)  In other Fellows news, well, maybe not news, but whatever...as there are 2 other Lauras, a Lauren and a Lori in the same Fellows group, I have made a decision to go by Lily instead, and make it easier for all involved. So, I am on my way to having a completely new identity to grow into! Still getting used to seeing my name written that way on papers (sign in for attendance and contact sheets). But, very exciting! Yay!  My schedule looked something like this:  7:45-8:45   leave the house, then walk 15 minutes to subway, sit on train for 30 min, transfer to a bus, then sit another 15 minutes.  8:45-9:00  wander around the campus, looking for my first class (recalling days of my first few days at UMHB)  9:00-12:00  Class  12:00-1:00   Lunch, find the bookstore, calculate that books will cost approximately $150. Realize this is a problem, seeing as how I have $20 in my bank account.  1:00-4:00  Class, again, where we try to explain previous situation to prof, who tells us to get the money  from our husband   and get the books. Also try to explain the whole internet thing, as he is sending all handouts for the class through email. Was told to "work around it." Argh.  4:00-6:30   Fellow Advisory. We try to pick this woman's brain for the real stuff we will need to know to be good teachers in the fall. Ask questions. Lots of questions.  6:30-7:30 Commute back to Astoria  7:30-now (?) Internet cafe. Venting. Needing to do homework before the whole process begins again tomorrow.  Thank God, we have Friday off!!  In totally unrelated news, I went to the AWED Gala event last night. I got there for the 10 last official minutes, so Rocio ushered me directly to the open bar and then gave me a plate and pushed me towards the finger foods. Got slightly drunk. Then Sarah showed up, and she, Rocio, the interns and I all went to Tropica, a bar inside Grand Central, and had another drink. (Just one more).  I really needed that.   Besides that, I fed my cats and was given an appreciative "chirp" from Lena and a somersault from Sydney. (They're so talented!) Love your pets!

      Ah, my first "official" day as an NYC Teaching Fellow has come to a close. And I'm exhausted already.   Lincoln Center was way cool, and it was overwhelming to see sooo many people that are now, essentially, in the same boat as I am. (Let's hope it doesn't turn out to be the Titanic, eh?)  To throw flowers at myself for a minute (to use one of my favorite newly-learned phrases) they let us know that we each were selected out of a pool of over 17,000 applicants. Approximately 2,000 have been chosen to go the distance and will begin school in September.   I met my cell group, which the program calls Fellow Advisory group, FA for short. There are about 15 of us who will all be attending Queens College and will be completing the coursework towards a Master's of Education in English together. Tomorrow morning we meet at campus to begin Master's work.   It's all a little scary, but also exciting to think about the new phase of my life that is beginning now. In my circle of friends, teaching is the most popular occupation, so I'm looking forward to joining the ranks. On that note, congrats to Holly, who is going to be spearheading BJH's brand spanking new theatre program, and to AmyKatPat, who is making her way towards securing a position in an Austin-area district. I wish you both the best of luck on your new endeavors!

      Well, it's been a crazy, busy weekend. Sarah arrived 2:30 yesterday afternoon, and we've been going non-stop since then. I took her around the 'hood and showed her where everything was, and we stopped at a little Italian place for an early dinner. Then, we went into the city to see The Stepford Wives. (Pretty cute.)   Today, we got up and went to church. We stayed for both the main service, and then went on to the 20/30 Connection group to hang with some people our own age. There's a girl there that's currently a teaching Fellow. She just finished her Master's degree through the program, and it was great to talk to her, since she knows exactly what it's like to be where I am right now. She was wonderfully supportive and encouraging about starting this journey. Being back at church again was a good feeling, too. I was reminded that that's somewhere I really need to be on a regular basis.   After church, Sarah and I took a quick trip back home to change clothes and headed back into the city. We spent a few hours at Central Park (pictures to come later) and then went to have dinner at Serendipity 3. (Yes, the Serendipity from the movie.) I'd tried to go there twice already, once with AmyKatPat, and once with my Aunt Liz and her husband, Kevin. Both times the wait times were at so ridiculous that we skipped it. I guess we were just lucky today. We were seated in less than 45 minutes. Anyway, it was so fun! The food was great, and there's a good reason they're famous for Frrrozen Hot Chocolate---it's amazing!   Hanging out with Sarah this weekend has really given me a new appreciation for the City, and I am anxious to begin exploring again. Also, she seems like she is going to be a great roommate, and someone that I think it will be easy to continue a friendship with even after she moves on to her own place.   We've ended up here, at an internet cafe near the apartment.  As for a Mom, I talked to her for over an hour last night, and it seems she was having a really good day (considering everything, of course). She was in good spirits and seemed cheerful. Bonnie is trying to arrange a for a hospice interview for the three of us for the weekend I'll be there. I'm waiting to find out exactly what time I'll be released on that Friday, so I can book a flight out. It'll be a quick weekend, but each day will bring me closer to August, when I can be home for a longer amount of time.   NYCTF starts tomorrow, with the welcome event, and official Master's classes starting Tuesday morning. There has been so much support for me doing this, for which I am so grateful. The people at AWED threw me the best farewell party, and gave me some generous and thoughtful gifts. I am looking forward to reporting back with my new experiences.

      There's a saying in Christian circles in regards to praying for patience, which says that if you pray for patience, you'd best be prepared for it to be tested. I think that the same theory relates to strength.  As difficult as things are right now, I think that God has been using the last few years to prepare me for this time. I've often thought, as I'm sure so many do, that I was being given more to deal with than was fair. However, I've spent some time looking back over the toughest experiences in my history - finishing school while my father was ill, eventually losing him, deciding to follow my dream to fly, to have that hope dashed as well, to come home and deal with romantic heartbreak (a few times), and finally picking up and moving here, and the initial hardship associated with that - and I've realized I was being shaped into a person who could deal with anything that might happen to me.   While I was going through all of my trials, I thought I was so unlucky! Everything was just so damn  hard . I kept wondering when God would just give me a break, already! The longer I've been here, evaluating everything, I've had a change of attitude and now see how amazingly fortunate I was.   My father was ill, but I got a long time to say goodbye and got the ultimate blessing to be able to really believe that his death, when it finally came, was a welcome release. I finished school, which if he had died more suddenly, I honestly don't think would have happened. I know I would have needed to quit altogther to stay with my mother.   I didn't get to have flying from exotic locale to exotic locate be my job, but I got to train through one of the most rigorous professional development programs in the country. And they paid for my ability to say, "When I was Amsterdam..."  Romantic heartbreak...I'm still working on the recognizing the benefits of this one for me, but right now, I can say that there were times that he was the one I needed, and he was there. I learned a lot about the traits I need to see in the man I will choose, as well as what I won't put up with. I've also made necessary changes in myself, finding that balance of keeping my own identity while contributing to his needs. In that process, I've become someone that will, eventually, make a amazing wife to the right person.   New York. If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, right? After months of thinking that the City was just going to chew me up and spit me out again, we've finally become friends. She has welcomed me on her sidewalks and held me close between towering buildings. Pretty soon, I'll start helping her grow by contributing to the young minds that reside here. And I know that in her way, she'll make sure I'm rewarded for that.   When the time comes, I know that God will give me what I need to work through whatever happens. He's been training me pretty exensively up to this point, even though I didn't realize it as it was taking place.

      I called Mom again last night. She's on really heavy drugs, so she's sleeping a lot. Good for her to get rest, scary for me when I call her 10 times and get no answer.   I finally spoke to her, and she was a little loopy, but is slowly admitting things to me. I asked her about her doctor's appointment, and she simply said that she was put back on treatment. When I asked about the results of her scan she said, "Well, it's not good," but that was all she would tell me.   We talked a little about me, since yesterday was my farewell party at work, and she asked me about everything going on with the Fellows. That was really nice for me, because up until she was given the new pain meds, she hasn't been able to talk to me for more than about 5 minutes at a time. She would ask me questions, but wouldn't be comfortable enough physically to hold the phone up and focus on the conversation. And that would upset her.   I did talk to her nurse the other day, and she told me that Mom had seemed anxious about me giving up the Fellows to come home, and that she needed to know that I would still be dedicated to something to help me get through the aftermath of what's going to happen. I can tell that Mom is really concerned with me being okay later on, and she believes that the best way to be secure is to go on with my Master's and start my new job. So, after hearing that, from the nurse and Mom, I think best course of action is for me to continue working here, try to come home as often as I can in the next few months, talk to her on the phone every day,hope that we get to spend one last holiday together, and if we do, make sure it's as special as possible.  I told Mom that I'm trying really hard to find a way to come home for the long July 4 weekend, and she seemed excited about that. This way, she'll know that I was planning a trip then anyway, and she won't feel that I'm sacrificing my future to spend time with her now. I'm also planning to come back for the few weeks I have in August and early September before I start teaching in the fall.   I can tell she's trying to ease me into all of this, as last night she told me I should start thinking about anything of hers that I would like to have, "just in case." She knows there's a lot to deal with in terms of the estate, (as some of you know, my father's estate still has not gone through probate yet,) and that she's going to have to tell me the whole truth pretty soon, but for right now, baby steps.   Thank ya'll for being so supportive. I really appreciate the messages I've been getting. Right now, things are okay, but I'm sure that later on, I'm going to take you up on your offers.

      My sister in law, Bonnie, called me last night. Things are not going well with my Mom. She had another doctor's appointment yesterday, and was told the cancer has not only returned, but spread.   She's going to have another round of chemo, but apparently that is only to prolong the amount of time she has left, which they are estimating to be around 6 months. She has been advised to settle her affairs and after this last set of chemo, will enter home hospice.   At this point, I haven't spoken to my Mom, partly because Bonnie and I were on the phone until around 4 this morning. The other reason is because my Mom asked Bonnie not to tell me. She doesn't want me to give up the Fellows program to come home and stay with her. (Of course, being my mother, she sees that as her decision, not mine!) I've left a message with Mom's nurse, and am waiting for her to call me with the medical issues. So, I'm going to call Mom, like normal, tonight, and see what she says and give her the chance to tell me in her own way.   I know there are only a few of you reading this right now, but this was the best way I could think of to put out a general cry for the help I'm going to need in the upcoming months as I try to make some hard decisions about what is best for myself and my family.   Please pray for us.

      When I turned on my computer at work this morning and opened Internet Explorer, it went directly, as always, to the MSN page.   One of their front page articles was entitled, "Flip Flops at the Office!?" with the subtitle. "What NOT to wear to work."  I think this is funny because I am, right now, blogging in flip-flops.   Hahahahaha. I have 4 days left. Whaydda they gonna do, fire me?

      So, I added a counter to the blog...now I can see just how many people are checking in on me. Thanks to that one person! (If that number doesn't bump up, don't worry, whoever you are. I won't quit writing, I'll just delete the counter. Hahaha.)  My head is better now. I went out to dinner with Matt, who is leaving for Italy at the end of this week to be with his pregnant wife (she is stationed there for her work in the Navy.) I guess cheesecake works better than Excedrin.  My roommate is essentially gone. She left one more trip's worth of stuff, but she did go ahead and turn in her keys. Hopefully, with her things now being behind locked doors she will be more persuaded to contribute towards the $600 she currently owes me.   I've been having kind of a nostalgic day, in the hours since my headache dissipated, anyway. Walking around the neighborhood reminded me of a walk I took with someone else, a long time ago, and then a CD I listened to reminded me of them as well. Even though we cared about each other, there are good reasons we're not involved in each other's lives anymore...the relationship didn't give either of us what we really needed. But for whatever reason, that knowledge doesn't make me immune from missing them, as much as I wish it did. I know it's silly, but there's this desire to know that they're missing me, too. (This would be the part on Sex and the City where Carrie would see whoever she's talking about on a date with a new woman. Hahaha.)   There was another time that we had separated, and I kept hearing "our" song all over the place. Everywhere. In elevators as muzak, in stores over the PA system, on the radio, I mean  everywhere . I remember thinking that if I was hearing it so much and thinking of him, he must be hearing it and thinking of me, too. That actually made me feel better. When we finally did get back together and I told him about it, assuming his response would be parallel to my own, he said, "What? We have a  song ?" Ugh. Frustration. Anyway, I'm annoying myself that I'm even still thinking about this. (It would help if that cute Ben Affleck look-alike from the train would call and distract me!)  Oh well, until then, tomorrow's a new day, and I can fill it with a walk heading somewhere else and a different CD.

      I had a great first half of the weekend, spending it hanging out with one of my best friends here in NYC. We went out for Chipotle, as it is now our tradition to spend Fridays in the company of burritos and beer, and then continued on to my apartment. There, we spent the rest of the evening watching Mystic River. Saturday we got my fixed up my house and then watched Mona Lisa Smile and Bend it Like Beckham. Overall, it was a fun and productive time.  Today I woke up with a headache that is progressing rapidly into a migraine, despite 2 Excedrin and a nap snuggling with a kitty. Ugh.   My current roommate is using the day to move out, which, in her usual fashion, is taking place the most unnecessarily difficult way possible. Rather than just calling a car service and loading the car and taking one trip to the apartment of whatever other person she has duped into thinking her was a normal, responsible adult, she has recruited a friend, and together they are transporting her things  one duffel bag at a time  using the subway. This experience epitomizes my entire relationship with her. Nothing is ever easy, even when it could be.   Only one more week of work before I start the Fellows training. Look for my university assignment to be revealed soon!

      I just got an email from the Fellows program, informing me that our first "official" day of the program will be a welcome event, hosted by the  urlLink Alice Tully Hall  at Lincoln Center. I've never been there, but it looks kinda swanky to me! However, work begins pretty quickly. The first few hours are a "glad you're here" thing, but the last 2 hours are set aside for consultation with our program mentors and to meet the other 30 or so other Fellows in our cell groups. (The entire cohort for the year of 2004 is expected to be around 2,000 Fellows, but we're further divvied up into smaller groups that will be taking university classes together throughout our Master's training.)  And as the days of the Fellowship beginning grow closer, so does the end of my time with AWED. In preparation for my departure, I have been working my butt off! I want to leave with a good impression, and so have been cleaning up all of the files on my computer, re-organizing the paper files I'm in charge of, teaching the 3 interns how to do my job, and writing a manual to help them out once I'm gone. Even though I've really been pushing myself, it's been a good week. It's nice to have so many people in the office again. (Over the last few months there has been, ahem, "restructuring" and our already small staff of about 10 was reduced to 6 full time people.) The AWED Annual Gala is approaching, too, and I'm hoping that I'm going to be able to scoot over to the Sky Club (see photo) after my day at whatever university I get assigned to. (That, I'm sure, will be posted here as soon as I find out!)  I'm also trying to learn more about how to make this page more interesting for those of you who are attempting to live vicariously thru me (hello, Stephen Greene!) So, as you can see, now that I can insert links, I'm teaching myself how to post photos. I'm also perusing other Blogs to see how I can do things that I see that I think are nifty. Saw one today that had recorded voice audio.  Way cool . More updates on that as I delve more into this area of computer savvy that is currently unknown, yet intriguing,  to me.

      So, I went to my school visit on Thursday. Unfortunately, my host Fellow wasn't exactly "all that". He teaches "ramp-up classes," which is just a way to un-label low performing kids with a  different  label. Out of his 90 minute class, 45 minutes was basically free time, although he had asked them to work on their final writing project of the semester. At one point, he walked over to me and the other girl observing and said, "Well, 90 minutes is a long time. I just don't know what else to do with them," while shrugging his shoulders. So, I was definately inspired by my classroom visit. Now I see the kind of teacher I don't want to be, and the residual influences that some of these kids will be bringing with them into my classroom. Let the battle begin.  Besides that, everything has been quiet. I'm working on getting organized for the beginning of my Fellows training, knowing that I'm going to have to be up and out the door at least an hour earlier than I'm currently used to. To be honest, I am so excited to start school, both as a teacher  and  a student.   I finished two more books in the last few days. One being  Good Grief , by Lolly Winston, which was exrememly well-written. It's about a woman in her mid-thirties who is struggling to heal after the death of her husband. Of course, parts of it are sad, but there's also a lot of realistically funny and touching situations as well. If you've lost someone you loved, you'll easily relate to the main character's journey. If you've ever known someone going through mourning, this will give you a glimpse into their life, and perhaps show you things you can do to help at a time when many people feel paralyzed-wanting to find a way to show support yet not be intrusive. There are not many resources out there to help people deal with the loss of someone important. It's not like anyone really  wants  to write "Funerals for Dummies." And because of that, we're left to figure things out on our own. For the first few weeks after my dad died, the attention was overwhelming. It wasn't that we didn't appreciate it-it's just that so soon afterwards, you're still in shock about the whole thing and you manage to go through all the motions in sort of a haze. What most people don't understand is that it's not until later, after the casserole dishes have all been returned and the "just calling to check on you" calls have stopped, that you really need that contact with others. Anyway, point being, this is a good book to read-there's something about it that simply resonates with feeling.  The other title I read was  A Man Most Worthy . All I have to say about it is that I never realized that the word "ass" could be used so many times as an adjective. I won't elaborate further on that. (It's an "Essence" book, but I didn't realize that when I picked it off the library shelf, and when I did notice it on the cover, I didn't think it would that much different. I mean, cheesy romantic is essentially cheesy romance, right? Hhhhmmm. I think I'll be more cautious in the future.)  After I finish  All Men Are Mortal  I plan on starting reading from a list of the top 100 recommended reads for students entering college. One book at a time...

      Listening to Ace of Base whilst I rapidly prepare for Spring Visit AND an impending new roomie (hiding all my dark secrets, hahaha).   Today was a crazy day at work. For the next 11 workdays, I'll still be sitting behind the front desk at  urlLink AWED . We just got 3 new interns, who seem quite motivated and intelligent. Therefore, we aren't exactly sure what to do with them (one only needs so many copies made). When I leave, they'll be covering my desk in shifts while work figures out what to do. So, I'm trying to do all my regular work stuff, plus train the interns while attempting to make a "Bible" for the desk, so whoever sits there eventually will be able to cope. I was soo glad when the clock read 5:30.  On the way home, I stopped by Petite Sophisticate (read:"mature" clothing) and got a "don't I look professional?" black bag that's big enough to hold a file folder stuffed with all the Fellows documentation I need to tote around to interviews. Okay, so I couldn't resist...I also got a teacher outfit. Black skirt, lavender twin set. Not flashy, but it really makes me look like a grown up, especially with my hair cut. (On that subject, a student who came into my work told me it made me look "like a lady". Not sure how exactly to take that.)  My home life is still in flux, with the roommate still avoiding me. However, the kittens are, as always, a joy. Sydney is bouncing around in the newly aquired shopping bag and appears to be happy as can be. (Ah, simple pleasures!) Lena is watching, but I can tell anym minute now she'll be fast asleep on the table. As I was reading  The Life of Pi , one word really made me smile. The boy, Pi, came upon an island, inhabited by not just meerkats, but meer kittens ! Meerkittens! What a great word.

      I've spent the last two evenings just...me.   Last night I watched "Red , White and Blonde," a girl-power movie if there ever was one. It's definately one I plan to add to my collection for those inevitable nights when I come home emotionally bruised from a tough day at school. There's just something about the way Elle Woods views the world that makes me believe that a pure heart can overcome any obstacle. Totally corny? Yes, I suppose so. But it works. (Just try to do the "bend and snap" alone in your living room without it putting huge smile on your face. C'mon, ya'll know you've done it, admit it!)  And uplifting movies have been my resounding choice of entertainment lately. Tonight was "Bruce Almighty," a really fabulous movie. Whenever I ever have one of those, "why-am-I-still-single-getting-closer-to-30-maybe-I-should-try-online-dating-again" thoughts, the way this movie ends reminds me of what I'm really waiting for and trusting in: that one day, when I least expect it, I will meet someone who will love me and treat me the way that all of us deserve...as the special and beautiful creations that we are. For those of you girls out there who see the end of your twenties rapidly approaching....SO WHAT!?! Don't settle for less than you really deserve. As some of you probably know, I know whereof I speak...  Okay, off the soapbox. Besides that, last night was eventful in another way. I finally, after literally stressing out about it for  months , had a talk with my roommate and it is offical:in two weeks time, she will be an ex-roommate. (Quick update for those not up to speed on my living situation. I decided to save some money by moving into the living room and subletting my bedroom. It sounds nuts, I know, but it's not such a bizarre thing here in NYC. Besides, it's just for a few months, until the teaching paychecks start rolling in.) Anyway, out with the old and in the with new. That's right, folks, I am giving the roommate game one more shot. Thanks to the Jennifer Lynns and AmyKatPat for showing me such that with the right people, a roommate situation can turn into a lasting friendship. (Hey, Conner, remember the Batman posters? Ha!)   This time the lucky winner is a girl from Ohio who actually has the money for rent saved in advance and only wants to stay a month or two while she finds her own place. Ah, the days of sleeping on my couch are coming to a close. There is truly a light at the end of my tunnel of financial suffering.   As for teaching program  urlLink NYCTF , the days are rapidly approaching towards summer training. I should get my university assignment next week! I had some schools email me about open positions today and will be sitting down to make some big decisions in the next week or so. Besides that, I'm also scheduled to attend my Spring Visit on Thursday. Spring Visit is like a Big Brothers/Big Sisters program for the Fellows. I was assigned to a current Fellow teaching in my region, and I get to go follow him around for a "day in the life" of a HS English teacher. I can't wait!

      Things are definitely better now than last week. Holly is here, and I'm in the process of finishing up some schoolwork so I can spend some time playing in the city.   Next week is the last week of university classes for my program, which means that everything is due all at once. It's crazy, but once it's over, that last week will be a piece of cake!  Starting on Monday, I have a final, a take-home final, a paper, and a group project that all has to be turned in before 4:30 on Thursday. After that, it's just field trips and more instruction on how to instruct.   We'll be graduating from training on August 6, and the ceremony will be on the world-famous Intrepid aircraft carrier. First thing Saturday, August 7, I'm on a plane home.   I'll be in town long enough to get to spend time with anyone who's free. I am so excited to be coming back to Texas!  &nbsp;

      Okay, so things are going. They aren't necessarily going well, but they're still going. &nbsp; Honestly, this doesn't even feel like it's happening to me.&nbsp; One minute I'm staring into space, the next I'm bawling. Then nothing.  &nbsp; I don't know what to say at this point. There are things that neither of my parents will never see in my life, and that makes me angry, and sad. And really, in a way, thinking about that helps me to deal with everything that's going on. I guess I figure if I can list out all the important events that I should know they won't be attending, then that fact won't be able to sneak up on me later.  &nbsp; My first day of school as a teacher, my Master's graduation, my wedding. I never imagined that neither of my parents would be there.  &nbsp; There's that saying about what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and I believe that. They just never tell you that sometimes that one thing that doesn't kill you might try to kill you again at every important event in your life from then on.

      My mom passed away a few hours ago.&nbsp; I'm currently waiting for my Aunt Liz to call me back to start the family phone tree, so&nbsp;I decided that while I waited, I would email my Fellowship advisor just to let her know that I wouldn't be at school tomorrow. &nbsp; We are planning to have a small gathering at the house when I come home in August, and I will be posting more details once they are decided.  &nbsp; Thank you all for your support during this time, you all have definitely been a source of comfort for me.  &nbsp; Unfortunately, now is when the really hard work begins.&nbsp;

      Last night, Sarah and I went down to the lower East side and had dinner at the famous Katz's deli. It is absolutely nothing like the one in Austin...it is pure New York. The counter guys are all yelling and it looks like it hasn't had a really good cleaning in a decade. However, the pastrami and rye and piece of cheesecake I had were truly the best ever.  &nbsp; The walls are covered with photos of famous customers, and there's even a sign hanging from the ceiling to show you  exactly  where Harry met Sally (Or more accurately, the table where Sally demonstrated faking an orgasm.) &nbsp; &nbsp;All in all, it was a great experience. (Also, it rates on Citysearch's "10 Things You Should Do in NY Before You Die. And on that list, I now only have 8 to go, since I've already been to the Empire State Building!) &nbsp; Besides that, it has been a calm weekend, which was especially needed right now. I still have homework before I go to class tomorrow, but it was so relaxing to just not do anything yesterday. &nbsp; Holly, I am really looking forward to next week-I've been saving ideas for things for us to do! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      On a very short note, I went to summer school today and was given the opportunity to do the "read-aloud." As I was reading, my Fellowship Advisor came in to observe my classroom skills. &nbsp; As I read, I asked the kids small questions about what certain words meant, what they thought would happen, or why characters did or said the things they did.  &nbsp; Later today, at our group Fellowship session, we brought up the subject of what the evaluations she would be giving us actually meant in terms of the program, or us becoming teachers. To reassure us, she said that she just wanted to peek in and see how we were relating to the children, and that she would be able to determine that, even if we were only sitting in a chair in the back of the class observing. Then, she said that she feels that some people are just born with an inherent "teacherness" about them. Not that teacherly traits can't be learned, just that if you were someone who needed to learn them, she wanted us to know and then help us accomplish that. &nbsp; At the end of the session, she went over the observations she had from today's summer school classes. She reviewed the things I did, and then exclaimed, "You know what? You're teacherly!" &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Was another tough day in the world of alternative education certification. I'm tired all the time, and frankly, three weeks seems like years away at this point.  However, I did get to do my first read-aloud session, and I actually, believe it or not,  sang  in front of my class!We're reading a book about a musician, and there were a few lines from the "Happy" song (you may have heard it on the Clinque commercials..."I want to be happy, but I can't be happy, unless you're ha-ap-py too!") Anyway, for the first time since I started going there, they were all attentive and most were even smiling! I was in such a shock! Looking forward to more "happy" moments!   Bonnie contacted some lawyers regarding everything happening with my mother, and apparently no one she spoke with wants to take the case. So, we're moving on to self-made will and distribution. Grreaaat. That really sucks, but what else can I do?  As for my blast from the past, I got an email today from classmates, and it seems an ex boyfriend from college wants to get in touch. Mmmm, I'm curious, because we really did not end on good terms. If nothing else, it could be really interesting, since I'm so, so over him and everything that happened between us. So, I gave him my email, just to see. Ha!

      Last night I pulled the closest thing to an all-niter than I had in years. That paper I'd been stressing over was given an extension, but of course, I didn't do it. I finally finished last night at nearly 4 am. Then, I woke up at 7 and went to school. It's now about 7 pm, and I'm in the school's library. Ugh. I need sleep...  Summer school was better today. They reduced our class size, so I don't think we had more than 20 kids in any of my classes. However, my co-op teacher still isn't happy, since she's being forced to teach science and social studies for her 3rd period.   I had been getting kind of anxious about not having actually gotten the chance to practice my teaching skills, but now I have a different anxiety: my first "real" lesson will be in social studies. I am really lucky in that another Fellow in my school is in the same situation, and we're going to try to work together. It's kind of crazy...me, teaching social studies! (She wanted to give me science, but I said no thanks!)  Besides that, things are okay, I guess. The kittens are good, and they make me happy. Which reminds me, that I need to make them happy and go get them some kitty kibble. Gotta run!

      My aunt Liz went to see Mom over the weekend. She called today before she left to go back to Reno, and gave me an update.  It was really good to know that the rest of the family is now becoming aware of the situation, and it's not quite so overwhelming. Aunt Liz was the executrix of my grandmother's estate, so she knows a lot more about all of the legal stuff than I do.   This has been the first weekend in a long time that I was able to get some real rest, and I think next week with summer school and university will go smoother.   Yesterday, Sarah and I went exploring down in Chinatown and got a couple little things and had lunch. Overall, it was a really nice day, and I got to relax, knowing that Aunt Liz was with Mom. (Not that I don't trust Bonnie, but Aunt Liz is a nurse, so there's an added level of confidence in that.)  Holly will be in NYC on the 22nd, and I am very excited at having her here! As another first year teacher, we will have tons to talk about! Can't wait to cram in as much fun stuff into that weekend as possible!

      Last night, around 11 pm, I opened my email to find an invitation to interview at 10 this morning with one of the three follow-up schools.   After a long wait and a short interview with a very assertive principal, I got the job!  I'll be teaching English to either 7th or 8th grade at K291 in Bushwick, Brooklyn.I'm still researching the school to be as prepared as possible for September, but what I do know is that they have a stong emphasis on the arts, and that appeals to me a lot.   Hopefully, I'll be able to get involved with some aspect of extra-curricular activities before school even starts. They have a drama group, dance team, and band. I'm very excited to get started.

      Today was my second day of summer school with children, and it was chaos. I knew that kids in summer school generally need extra help, and also might be behavior problems, but honestly, I was not prepared for what I experienced today. There was yelling, screaming, fighting and so much more. My mentor teacher literally threatened to quit today. I won't go into it much more, because tomorrow I have a midterm in one class and 10 page paper due in the other.    Will update more soon, probably this weekend, after I get everything done and have had some sleep.

      Got back into LaGuardia (LGA) today. Very, very tired. Still have homework to do, and I start summer school, with actual children, tomorrow morning. Thank God tomorrow is just observation!  Am planning to return to Tx in August as soon as my university stuff is done for the summer. I will start teacher inservice, assuming one of my 3 as-of-yet unscheduled follow-ups go well and I have a place to go, on Sept 7. Kids arrive Sept 13. Wow.  Was very glad to see kittens, as they are quite furry and cute and make the world seem like a better place when they curl up next to me purring. They were obviously well taken care of by Aunt Sarah, who revealed to me that Sydney has honored her by sleeping on her lap over the weekend. Awwww.

      Hospice came today to make assessments of our situation. She is definitely qualified for home care, which is both good and bad. Good that we will have help, bad that she is already at the point where it appears she will need an aid 3 times a week, and a managing case nurse 2 times a week.  This is going to be a difficult road. I can already see that in the time I have left this trip not everything will be accomplished that I would like.   However, there are things that I will get to do that are much more meaningful and  supercede the things I would have liked to have gotten done. I really am lucky in that we will get to chose some things that she would especially like to do while she has the ability to do them.  Tomorrow, I will be going with Mom to see the fireworks display. How do you not cry when your Mom says she'd at least like to see fireworks one last time? By knowing that if she sees you cry, she'll cry, which is worse than almost anything else in the world.   Again, I wish I could curl up with someone nice for a while and just let myself melt into them. I know I need to count on myself, because there are things that have to be done that no one else can do for me: I have to write my papers for school, I have to clean another part of the house tomorrow so hospice can work while I'm gone, and I have to start sorting through Mom's current expenses so I know what we're dealing with, along with probably a hundred other tasks that are waiting. However, this all would be easier if I had someone in my life that would wrap their arms around me and help make it disappear, if only for a few minutes. Unfortunately, God has not chosen to bless me with that gift. I suppose it's selfish, but I can't help but wonder why.

      I'm here. Tired beyond belief, but here.   My flight, which I left for at 5 am this morning, was delayed by an hour. Then, with the miracle of air travel, we "made up" the time in the air. That way, I made my connection and landed in Austin around noon.  My Mom looks worse than I had expected. She's lost a lot of weight, and can't really get out of bed. Stephen, of course, is the biggest jerk in the world and is making every process harder than it needs to be. Bonnie was going to take the kids over to her parents' tonight, but has reconsidered and is going to take them in the morning. Shelby has been a terror all day-to the point where I locked her outside to get her to stop screaming her head off.   I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I know that I  can , I just don't know  how . Sometimes I wish I could curl up with someone nice for a while and just let myself melt into them.

      For as long as I can remember, people have been telling me I look just like my mother. However, if I was actually  with  my mother, she would tell me later, "They don't know what they're talking about. You actually look just like your father."  And I believed her. I mean, she IS my mom, after all.  Then, I found this:  urlLink    My mom, approx 1977  urlLink     urlLink   urlLink   And, the picture of my mom putting a scarf on my head...so funny, because I actually wore that yellow and blue shirt (mom made it herself in Home Economics!) while I was in college.

      Um, yeah, so my "do-it-myself" plane connection in Dallas didn't go so well. I made a big mistake by arranging my transfer through Love Field instead of DFW, where I actually touched down. This lead to being stuck at DFW for about 3 and a half hours, followed by a road trip with my sister-in-law and both kids from Dallas into Austin. Yay.  Oh well, I'm actually here, so I guess that's good. I started work on Mom's house this morning, trying to get the bedrooms empty so we can go ahead and put the kids' furniture in there so they can stop having to sleep on the couch.  I worked for several hours, then went out. First I stopped at Starbucks, which was an extremely well-needed experience, then continued on to Olive Garden for a glass of Sangria and some good conversation with my friend AmyKatPat.  Tomorrow is yet another day, and there is lots left to be accomplished!

      Only 5 more days of going to Fellows stuff for the rest of the summer. University coursework is technically done, but with my family situation, my two professors gave me extensions to finish up the huge workload due for the end of semester. So, I'm spending the rest of this weekend getting together my papers that need to be turned in and studying for my Ed Psych final.  Last weekend with Holly was a ton of well-needed fun. We went to see 3, yes, 3, broadway shows. After she arrived Thursday night, we went to Brick Cafe, where we spent, um, I think, somewhere between 3 and 4 hours catching up.  Friday, she went to school with me at Queens College. What a brave soul! That night for dinner, we went to the Olive Garden in Times Square. It was absolutely pouring down rain, and we all got soaked (although I got it the worst, being a dummy and thinking that when the rain had quit earlier that afternoon, it was really over, and therefore choosing not to take an umbrella). Still, the Olive Garden is always good, even when you're wet. And even being wet doesn't seem too bad after a Long Island iced tea and a Cosmo. Hahaha. (Holly, I still owe you a drink, girl!)  Saturday night we saw "Wonderful Town" with the amazing Donna Murphy. We actually went and waited by the stage door for her to come out, but after what felt like forever, we decided to press on and do other things. Like go to the Virgin Megastore and buy lots of music. Yay!  Sunday, we went to the tkts booth again, and got seats for the matinee performance of "Bombay Dreams." Oh-the costumes, the dancing! It was fantastic! From there, we stopped quickly at Roy Rogers and got a quick bite, and then met Sarah out front of the famous Winter Garden theater, where we saw "Momma Mia!" That was truly spectacular! Although lots of people sang along through the whole show, at the end, I don't think there was a single person not dancing in the aisles! And it was special because it was Sarah's first Broadway show  ever . Afterwards, we went to Ellen's Stardust Diner, where the servers take turns performing. Turns out that our waiter was actually from Sarah's hometown in Ohio, and was only a year or two older than her. Only in NY!  In case you're curious, the ex-boyfriend is still calling me. It seems he is determined to get himself "back in the picture," but he has, um, shall we say, some "issues." The most I have agreed to at this point is to let him take me out to dinner once while I'm in Texas. He had already been planning to go to see his family, but after talking with me on the phone, put off his intended schedule to wait until I would be there. So, no pressure or anything there, I just thought that just about anyone who has the guts to call after 6 years should be given at least a chance.  Anyway, I am very glad to have things wrapping up here and am ready for a break from school. I'll see ya'll soon!
