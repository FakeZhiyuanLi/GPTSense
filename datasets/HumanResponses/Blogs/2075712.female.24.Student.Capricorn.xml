						    Bar Hopping   Yesterday was so much FUN !  I actually did some form of exercise when I went to Azusa..It's so beautiful there, it's like something you would see on a postcard.  Since Friday was my mom's 16 year anniversary with my stepdad, we went out to dinner yesterday...which I was honestly pretty nervous about since R and my mom have had tension between them for the past several years..Then at the last moment my brother cancelled which sucked cuz he is normally the one that makes  uncomfortable situations easier to deal with.  Anyways..we get to the restaurant and had to wait cuz my mom got lost on the way there..and R was getting very nervous and annoying.  I was so happy with the outcome...they actually got along very well !!  It was even, what some may call "fun".  After dinner we met Janice, Hugo, and Lui at Starbucks and went to city walk to try to get into any club or bar (which is pretty hard since neither R or I are 21 yet).  Anyways...R was being a funny guy and attempted several times to get into the same place even though they already told him several times that he was not old enough. To make a long story short we used Hugo and Janice's ID's to get in...and it was probably the whole adventure that made it so much more fun.  To top it off...there was no drama, which happens sometimes with my group of friends when there is alcohol involved.  Now it's Sunday and I had only 3 hours of sleep and I'm a little hungover...and I still have homework to do so I better get to that...today sucks.

						   I don't really have alot of time to post.  I'm going to Azusa to go hiking with R and Chato (my beautiful boxer).  I wish we did  not have to leave this early, and I could sleep longer.  I'm still trying to get the hang of this...telling my ideas and feelings on a computer..this is new to me.  It feels kinda funny...that's ok though I'll get used  to this.  I guess eventually I'll make an about me page or something.  Not that anyone would want to read this blog of my boring life..=)

						   Well, today is me and my boyfriend's 4 year anniversary...WOW!! When I met him in 11th grade, I would have never imagined that 4 years later I would still be with him.  I went through all of my old pictures and felt really happy...all this time and we've lasted through it all...the good, the bad, and the great.  I really had a lot to say but R's mom just gave me this big plate of really good food...so I really got to go cuz it's just staring at me..  till the next time..

						   I just found this recipe for Sancocho de Gallina on my  urlLink dad's  site and thought I would share with anyone who's interested.  Sorry, it's in spanish...maybe I'll translate later.   Sancocho de Gallina Cartagenero   (Para 10 personas) 2 libras de costillas de cerdo redondas  2 libras de carne salada  3 libras de costilla de res  1 libra de cerdo salado  1 rabo de res (opcional) 1 gallina despresada  4 libras de yuca 3 libras de ñame  1 libra de auyama 1 libra de batata 6 marzorcas tiernas 5 plátanos maduros  1 plátano verde (opcional) 3 tallos de apio 2 napos o colinabos  1 pedazos de repollo  1 libra de cebolla cabezona 1 macito de cebolla de hoja  1 libra de tomates  4 dientes de ajo  8 ajíes dulces 2 zanahorias grandes 8 granos de pimienta de olor  10 litros de agua   **pimienta al gusto y salsa negra **el jugo de 2 limones.  La carne salada se lava para quitarle el exceso de sal. En una olla grande y alta se cocina a fuego lento la carne salada y las costillas de carne con el rabo de res y los condimentos aproximadamente 2 horas. Al cabo de este tiempo, se agregan el cerdo salado y fresco, la gallina y los plátanos maduros sin pelar, lavados y cortados los extremos, y el maíz en rodajas gruesas. Cuando los plátanos maduros y el cerdo estén cocidos se sacan y se apartan. En este momento se añade lo demás, la auyama sin pelar, teniendo cuidado de que todo quede en su punto de cocción. Verificar la sazón. Al momento de servir se sacan todos los ingredientes y se colocan en bandejas por separado. El caldo se pasa por un colador.

						   I wish I new where I could buy Drake's devil dogs online.  I live on the west coast and these yummmy treats are sold on the east coast..I found a recipe online but to be honest I've been to lazy to try making them.  Anyways...I'll stop being a fat ass now and stop talking about food, like always.  I've had light brown hair with blond highlights for over 3 years now and now that I've completely dried out my hair and scalp, I've been thinking about going to back to my  natural color...dark dark almost black brown hair.  I would really like to save some $$$ and do it myself at home but the last time I tried this my hair turned brownish green...which was NOT cute.  I'm gonna go now cuz I'm gonna do some research on dying my hair at home...oh, yeah and I'm gonna attempt to add a shout box...not that anyone visits my site...I just think they're cool to have.

						   In light of today being the Chinese New Year, I thought it would be fun to check out what my sign is in  urlLink chinese astrology .  So....yup, I'm a DOG.    Here's what it said about me:      In the West, the Dog is man's best friend, but in Chinese Astrology this Sign is a little more unpredictable than that. Dogs are loyal, faithful and honest and always stick to their firm codes of ethics. However, this Sign has trouble trusting others. It's generally quite trustworthy itself -- except for the occasional "little white lies" the Dog tells in order to make things go more smoothly. The Dog makes a wonderful, discreet and loyal friend (despite any white lies) and is an excellent listener. This Sign tends to root for the underdog and its keen sense of right and wrong makes it duty-bound to the core. The Dog's mantra seems to be, Live right, look out for the little people and fight injustice whenever possible.  Dogs can also be rather dogmatic, too. They don't go in for light social banter; instead, they go straight for home, expostulating on the topics that are most important to them. At these times the Dog's narrow-minded or stubborn side can become apparent; this Sign has trouble staying light and calm when an important issue is at stake. This Sign can also be very temperamental; mood swings characterize its emotional life and often the Dog needs to run off to be alone in order to recuperate. Part of the problem is the result of this Sign's load of irrational fears that turn into niggling anxieties that turn into hurt feelings and occasional grouchiness. This sensitive Sign needs to warm up to others over time and gradually learn to trust them. Without that trust as a foundation, Dogs can be judgmental and coarse.  The Dog's discerning nature does make it an excellent business person, one who can turn that picky, guarded nature into a keen sense of the truth of another's motives. Where love is concerned, Dogs often have a tough time finding the right match. They can be so anxious and overwrought in the romance dance that they'll stress their partner to the max! In any forum, this Sign is happiest when able to be quite physically active; at home or at work, the Dog will always be constructing something new or cleaning something up in order to make things better. Dogs need to work on controlling their irrational worries and would also be well-served to relax their mile-high standards, which can sometimes wind up alienating the ones they love.  The most compatible match for a Dog is the Tiger or the Horse.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I've got to say that most of what it says is like me.

						    Finally....I'm 21   It's great but it's kind of sad too. When I was 14, I couldn't wait to be 16. When I was 16, I couldn't wait to be 18. When I was 18, I couldn't wait to be 21. But now I'm 21, and to be honest I don't think I'll look forward to any more birthdays. This also means that as much as I feel like I'm 16 still...I'm not. Every year that passes I keep getting new responsibilities. Which is not so great, but with those responsibilities comes much more freedom than I've ever had.  On the upside, I can go out to clubs. I can drink or buy drinks anywhere. I can go out with all my 21+ friends. It's actually kind of funny cuz I feel like I'm still 16 yet many of the friends I grew up with...now have children of their own.   January 16th Went to work. Went to eat with my dad, my brother, my sister-in-law, both of my nephews, and my boyfriend. We went to celebrate my dad's birthday which was on the 15th. We ate at an Italian restaurant. The food was verry yummy! This whole month is filled with so many birthdays!   January Birthdays  My big bro - Jan. 3 My boyfriend - Jan. 13 My dad - Jan. 15 Me - Jan. 18 My friend - Jan. 23 My boyfriend's lil' sis - Jan. 25  This is always a fun month for me!   January 17th   My birthday was sooooooooo much fun!!! We went to a restaurant/bar/club in the Universal City Walk called Cafe Tu Tu Tango. We had some appetizers and I bought my first drink. It was called "Wango Tango"...mmmmm, it was sooo good...it tasted like a really cold watermelon. Then right before we get up to go to the patio the waitress brings me a drink "on the house" for my b-day. It was a blow job. Never had one of those before. Anyways, so they made me put my hands behind my back and put my mouth over the shot glass and just take it like that. After that the DJ made me and several of the other birthday girls there dance by ourselves....which I did not do. I was drunk but not THAT drunk. My best friend went to the middle and danced with me. I kept ordering drinks and each time the bartender would give me a free drink for my birthday! Which obviously meant I got wasted. But it was a good wasted, I didn't get sick.    January 18th - My actual birthday   The next morning I woke up with a little hangover and not enough sleep. I went to a mexican restaurant to have lunch with my best friend, her sister, her sister's boyfriend, and of course...my boyfriend. I had a "Acapulco Breeze"...also very yummy. The food was deeeeeeeelicious, too! Then the waiter brings me another "on the house" drink. Well...technically it was not a drink it was a shot...Tequilla and lime. So, needless to say I was buzzed again. Then I went to my boyfriend's house and his mom played "Las Mañanitas" for me. We had a beer together. Then I went home and spent the evening just talking with my Dad.  That's how I spent my birthday weekend. It was great! I spent it with all of my loved ones.

						   Happy New Year!!!!  Ok, I know that was extremely late considering we are already 8 days into January...but better late than never.   I haven't had the chance to write here since...Dec. 21st...damn.  You'd think I have a life or something...lol.  Christmas kind of sucked for me because I was very sick...in fact I would have preferred to be in bed on X-mas eve than to be receiving presents.  I hadn't been that sick since I was a little girl...and the worst part is that I have asthma so everytime I get sick it seems to get worse.  New Years week was much better for me....my cousin, Silvi made a surprise visit from Colombia.  It was really great to see her again...last time I saw her was when she was 15 and I was 16.  The funny thing is that we did not grow up together yet I feel like she's one of my favorite family members from my dad's side.   We click really good together.  I spent New Year's eve with Silvi, my bro, my cousin Migue, and of course my boyfriend.  It was fun...we just hung out with several other friends, drank, played ping pong *my cousin Migue's X-mas present from his girlfriend*, and listened to music.  Later on in the night, my boyfriend and I went to his house to spend some time with his family.  Ummmmm.....BAD idea!! Everyone was already kind of tipsy...excluding my responsible boyfriend (he's a responsible driver).  So, one thing led to another...and long story short my boyfriend got into an argument with this mother.  Then one of his nosy aunts decided that the reason my boyfriend argued with his mom was because he MUST have been in a bad mood with me....DAMN, why do people always have to go assuming shit ?????   We were having the bestest time until we got there.  Oh well...we still had fun that night.   The next couple of days were spent hanging out w/Silvi before she left on Jan. 4th.    Now I'm almost through with the 1st work week in January...tomorrow is PAYDAY !! Which is absolutely $%ckin' great!! I know I'm not the only broke one after X-mas.    BTW...I just realized that in the last post I didn't even mention what "Sancocho de Gallina" is....so, it's just a Colombian version of Chicken Soup.  It's really great, if anyone wants me to translate just let me know.  COUNTDOWN: 10 more days until my   urlLink 21st Birthday

						   Well. I finally visited my grandma and my nephew.  She is very sick, just like I heard.  I'm not going to write about that today though.  I visited my nephew and he is the most ADORABLE baby  ever .   He kicks so much now and he attempts to talk but all it sounds like is "agoo, abadagooo"..it's soooooo cute!  He's almost 6 months old now.     I've gone hiking now for once a week for 2 weeks now!!! Yay!! I plan on doing this every weekend.  I don't get hardly enough exercise in the week...the least I could do is go hiking once a week.  At least to get a some sort of a workout.

						   My poor nephew has the flu..and he's had it for about 2-3 weeks...poor baby.  He's only 5 months old.  I've got to go visit him soon cuz I miss his beautiful little smile.  This weekend I'm going to do my rounds with my whole family.  I've been out of the loop in visiting my family for a month or two but it seems like  forever .   Tomorrow, I'm going to my Real Estate Principles 101 class in the morning and then I'm going to take a hike in Griffith Park.  After that I'll probably visit my Grandma C just to hang out with her and play cards.  Then I'll probably go out on Sat. night...just not sure where.  On Sunday, I absolutely  MUST  visit my Grandma A...she has been very sick and I fear that she may be leaving us soon...=(   I pray that she gets better...  I know it's a part of life but to be honest I just don't know how the hell to deal with it.  I've been trying to prepare myself since I know that she is very old and now she is very sick...to top it off, she won't visit a doctor.  She is very opinionated and stubborn, but more than anything she is the biggest sweetheart  ever .  I've been very lucky...to this point in my life I have not dealt with the loss of someone who I'm extremely close to.  I know there is no avoiding it but I'm scared.  I'm scared for my grandpa who will be left alone.  I'm scared for my mother who is losing her mother.  I'm scared because I won't have be able to see her anymore.  I guess this is my way of attempting to prepare myself for the inevitable.  I've heard sayings before that mean something to the effect of...don't worry about death until it comes..but I'm afraid that it may be too much for me to handle if I don't start getting prepared.  Although, I am attempting to prepare myself...I hope and pray that my grandmother will get better and live to see another 10 years.  When I go visit her, I will try to convince her to let me take her to a doctor...and then maybe she'll get better.

						   Where do I start ?  Hmmm...I was born here in Cali but my parents came here when they were in their early twenties and are the first generation in my family here in the U.S. from  urlLink Colombia .  My dad was born in  urlLink Barranquilla  and my mother was born in  urlLink Bogota, the capital of Colombia .  I have always been proud to be a colombian...even though I have never visited.  I'm sure there is much to it, that I just couldn't know about unless I went there and experienced it first hand.  I know one day I will go, but due to my current money situation,  it will probably be several years before I get the chance to go.  I have a few things which have been passed on to me through my parents...such as  urlLink arepas ,  urlLink vallenato , and a  urlLink sancocho  made by my abuelita.    Unfortunately, at this time in my life I am feeling quite disgusted with the  urlLink violence in Colombia .  I still have quite a bit of family there and recently....things have been  BAD .  About a year and a half ago one of my uncle's was murdered on his farm.   WHY ?  According to different stories I've heard it's either the paramilitaria or the guerillas there who decide that if you own a farm then you must give them lots of money so they don't kill you.  In the end, whether you pay them or not...you will probably get killed.  Now...I'm bringing this up because on this previous Sunday night, February 8th...I was informed that my aunt was also killed.  OMFG!!!  What the hell is wrong with these heartless killers ????  This is the wife of my uncle who was killed about 1 year ago...OMFG !!!  They have 4 children...my cousins.  This whole situation infuriates me....WHY is this being allowed ??  I hate this.  At this time, I pray that my cousins are safe and I pray that god is with them as they need him now more than ever.    Then this makes me realize something else...here I am in the U.S....and I've grown up around a bunch of spoiled kids who "hate" their parents...basically because the children take their parents and lives for granted.  We're so lucky to be here and not have to deal with many of the problems that third-world countries have to deal with.   All of this made me realize how quickly a life can be taken...sometimes you forget that life is so fragile.  I've decided that I will try my very best to not take my family and friends for granted...because in a quick second.... everything  can change.

						   At first I thought...who the fuck cares ? It's not the first time that someone's boob is out on national TV.  For ex..Lil' Kim wore several ummm...not so there outfits..          Why weren't Lil' Kim's outfits a big deal ?  But I finally saw a close up of what Janet Jackson was wearing and finally realized how wrong it was to do this at a family watched event.  I don't think she meant for the red lace part to come off to...but who knows...I guess it could have been a publicity stunt.  If you look closely, it's not even covering her nipple...  I don't really care...but if I had kids I probably wouldn't feel the same.    Anyways...on to something new.  I'm getting decent $$$ back from my taxes...YYYYEEEESSS !!! I'm also going to splurge on  urlLink MAC  products.  Thankfully I found out about this great sell at Bendel's which is in New York.  I'm in Cali but you can place orders over the phone and it will be included as part of their big sale!  Basically, for every $100 you spend, you get $50 off.  So, I'm buying $300 worth of MAC and only paying $150 plus $9 shipping for the whole thing!!  That's the absolute best sale I've ever heard of for MAC products...actually it's for the whole Bendel's store too !

						   Last Thursday my grandma finally decided she was ready to go to the hospital.  It looks like she does NOT have stomach cancer!!  THANK GOD !!!  but....she does have many other health problems that we need to take care of.  1. She has a HUGE  urlLink ulcer  in her stomach. 2. It is internally bleeding. 3. She has lost so much blood that she is now  urlLink anemic . 4. She has 3 masses in her body, although they are not cancerous..I don't think they can be good for her. 5. And last but not least...she has  urlLink fluid in her lungs .  I do have to say that I am so absolutely thrilled that she does not have cancer!!! I am sooooooooooooooooooooo HaPpY !!!  I hope that she can get better! The doctors are giving her lots of meds and she is finally eating again!  Ok, that's all for now...going to go visit her!

						   I got this in an email and thought it was funny so here it goes..  ==================== ==================== ====================  From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:  What makes 100%? What does it mean to give more than a 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give more than 100%. How about achieving 103%?  Well, here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:  If the letters of the alphabet  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z were numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 then:  H - A - R - D - - W - O - R - K would be: 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  and,  K - N - O - W - L - E - D - G - E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7 +5 = 96%  but,  A - T - T - I - T - U - D - E 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%  however - -  B - U - L - L - S - H - I - T 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%  and, look how far ass kissing will take you:  A - S - S - - K - I - S - S - I - N - G 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9 +14+7 = 118%  So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that: While, hard work and knowledge will get you close, and, attitude will get you there, it's Bullshit & Ass Kissing that will put you over the top.

						   It feels like it's been forever since I write in my blog.  Anyways..everythings still going the same.  My grandma is still sick and is looking no better.  The worst part is that she refuses to see a doctor.  Anyways, I hope she gets better!  *crosses fingers*  Today I'm going with my sister to see if we want to sign up at this new curves by our house.  My friend goes there and she has seen a lot of results in just one month.  My sister doesn't really need it, she's only 15 (going on 16) and only weighs like 105 pounds and I don't weigh that much more (i'm 120) either but I think we're both doing it just to get and stay toned.  Plus, it will give us time to spend quality time together.  I don't live at home so I don't get to see her that often.  As she continues to grow older, we are starting to have a lot more in common...and I don't even want to pull her hair out or yell at her anymore.  I really look forward to the day that me and my sister become closer...she's such a great person.  I really admire the way she's handled her life so far.  At her age, I was already rebelling and acting like an idiot teenager.  She seems to be more in control of her life than I was.   Anyways...hopefully I will get my ass in to shape!!  I thought I'd share this wonderful picture of one of my favorite men...ENJOY!

						   Life goes on...nothing new.  That's my reason for not posting in my blog.  When nothing fun or interesting happens, I've got to refrain from posting some stupid shit.  Yesterday was nice...went to my boyfriend's house for their usual "everyone-in-the-family-come-to-the-house-eat-drink-and-have-an-easter-egg-hunt" bar-b-q.  It was ok..I wouldn't say it's been the best year though.  R's mom and his sisters had an argument which kind of killed the whole mood.    I'm on Spring BREAK finally!!  I was in need of a break !  The only thing that sucks about it...is that I don't have anything fun planned.  That sucks.  Oh, well.    I really need to lose weight...on Saturday I bought my first pair of jeans that are size..... 7/8 ...I can't believe it.  In 9th grade I was a size 0,1.  In 11th grade I was a size 3.  After I finished high school I was a size 5...but I've never been anything bigger than a 6.  I'm not disciplined though...I don't have the power to turn away my favorite foods.  Maybe if I just exercise a lot...I can continue to eat how I'd like and still lose a couple of pounds...I've got to try it.  This summer I am going to take another gym class.    ok, that's all for now..=)

						   Well...life has been different.  The past 2 weeks involved taking care of funeral preperations.  I got a chance to see my Grandma for the last time before she was cremated.  I was really scared.  It was just a short viewing for the family so she wasn't going to have any makeup on...which scared me.  She had already been dead for about 5 days..I was scared that she would look fake.  I was really amazed at my grandmother's look though.  She didn't look dead at all...she looked like she was sleeping.  She didn't look pale.  I'm glad I decided to go.  I got to say goodbye to her.  Ok, I know this sounds crazy but maybe I was just in some sort of denial while I was there.  I could swear that her stomach was going up and down at an even pace as if she were breathing.  I pointed this out to my family and they could see it too.  My cousin said it was because she still had air inside her body.  I know that's true but it was tripping me out cuz it was so steady and even.  Then I was touching her beautful hair (she always had better hair than any of her children, or grandchildren) and all of a sudden she lets out a burst of air through her mouth.  I stepped back and sat down cuz I felt like I was going crazy, I was starting to convince myself that she might be alive and just sleeping.  To this point I had not felt her actual skin.  I guess I had to though.  So, I didn't continue thinking "maybe she's still alive"....so finally I touched her forehead and felt chills throughout my whole body.  She was ice cold and very hard.  My grandpa didn't have the energy and he couldn't handle seeing her again...like that.  He didn't go to see her.  I understand, he cried the whole time and said that's not the way he wanted to see her...he kept saying "I just want her alive".  My poor grandpa...he's such a sweet guy and he loved my grandma soooo much.  I can't stand to see him alone.  It breaks my heart and I cannot even imagine the pain that he feels.  Like I told him..I'm very sad and will miss her greatly but I know that know one feels it as badly as he does...our family decided that we've got to keep my grandpa busy.  We don't want to lose him too.  I'm really proud of him though...he is so strong.  I always used to tell my grandma and grandpa that I wanted to marry a guy who loved me as much as my grandpa loved my grandma.  One good thing came out of this sad time.  My cousin who I grew up with, we'll call her J.  J and I were inseperable growing up.  At some point we kind of lost contact with each other and grew in different directions.  Well..I always thought she didn't care much for our family.  I mean...I know our family is not the  best  family but nontheless they are still are family.  Well..I was wrong.  During this whole time, she has been there for my grandpa and mom just as much as anyone else has.  I got to spend alot of time with her and realized that I really miss having her as part of my life.  I hope that we keep in touch more now.  Not only that but she's moving in a week or two and we will live only several blocks away.

						   Friday, May 7th, 2004.  I got the worst possible news EVER.  I thought my grandma was getting better.  I thought she wasn't going to die.  I thought all she had was a really bad ulcer.  My grandmother passed away.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I couldn't stop shaking, I thought I was going to faint.  I love my grandmother...she was my second-mother.  She was soooo funny !!  I loved her sarcastic sense of humor.    Anyhow..I was sitting in work when my mom called me and told me to get to my grandparents house as soon as possible and to treat this as an emergency.  I asked her if she thought my grandma was going to pass away and she didn't say anything.  So, I start closing all of my programs as I call my cousin and tell her that there is some emergency at my grandma's and that we should get over there asap.  I was about to go tell my boss that I was leaving when my sister called me.  She told me not to go to my grandma's house anymore...she told me to go to my mom's house.  At this point I was really confused.  I told her that I had just spoken to my mom and that she told me to go to my grandma's. She said I just spoke to my mom and she told me to tell you to come here (to my mom's).  Here's when I realized something very strange was going on.  I asked my sister, did she pass away already ?  and she started crying.  I knew then that my grandma was no longer with us.  I started crying and shaking.  I just wasn't expecting to lose my grandma so soon.  I went to my mom's house w/ R & waited for my brother to arrive.  Then we left together to go to my grandparent's house.  I was so sad to see my grandma like that.  They hadn't taken her body yet.  She was lying on the floor in the living room.  That is where she died.  I guess she was sitting on the couch when she asked my grandpa who was in the next room for water.  By the time, he got to the living room she was already falling over the couch and was unconcious.  When the paramedics arrived they layed her flat on the floor to try to bring her back.  After some time, they said that if my mom and grandpa would like them to continue they  may  be able to bring her back but she would be on a machine which would be breathing for her.  My grandma was a very stubborn strong woman.  She always knew exactly what she wanted.  She had already signed paper work previously to make sure that if she was already at the point where she was practically dead, she did not want to be brought back to live in a hospital or a "home for the viejitos" as she would call them.  So my mother and grandpa were faced w/a very difficult decision.  They knew my grandma's wishes but at that moment all wanted was to keep her alive so that they could still have her.  They couldn't decide so the paramedics continued to try.  Unfortunately, they were not able to bring her back.  Her heart would not beat.  She looked very calm, like she was at peace.  She looked like she was sleeping.  It's really strange...I'm really sad, that I won't get to hear all her crazy stories and watch her dance but at the same time I'm glad she is no longer in pain and she is no longer having trouble sleeping.  It's really hard to see my grandpa alone.  They were inseperable.  In love.  Even after 53 years of marriage.   I would love to remember my grandma for her great, funny personality. I wrote this post in my  urlLink live journal"  account on February 18th, 2004 with some of the great things my grandma would do.  I just hope that my grandpa will be ok, I hope I don't lose him too.  His heart is sooo broken.  I hate to see my granpa and mom in so much pain.    As far as I believe, when someone is dead...they are dead...and that's it.  There's nothing more.  I don't really believe in heaven & hell, or reincarnation, or anything else.  Maybe her soul continues to live.  I don't really know where but I feel like she can hear me.  I've been listening to Carlos Vives all weekend and it's for her.  I know she loved her vallenato, salsa, merengue, and italian music (not exactly sure what type of music that is, but that's what she would call it).  I think that she's happy when she is listening to music.  She is the reason I love the music too.  I don't know if she can hear me or hear my thoughts but if she is consious of anything I want her to know this...  Quiero que sabes que te quiero mucho y nunca te voy a olvidar.  Voy hacer todo que puedo para ayudar a mi abuelo.  Una ves a la mes voy a poner el aceite en mi pelo para que se mira bonito como tu pelo.  Voy hacer ejercisios y ya estoy comiendo comida buena.  Tu siempre vas hacer una de las mas importante personas que ha estado en mi vida.  Te quiero muchisimo !! Estoy feliz que ya no sientas dolor, y siempre vas hacer una reina de belleza de Colombia, para mi.  Voy a tratar de no pintar mi pelo y yo le corto el pelo para mi abuelo (si me deja).   Voy a quidar tus munecas y mas importante a mi abuelo.  Quiero que sabes que toda la familia te extrana mucho y que te quieren mucho.  Te voy a extranar, quisiera bailar una ves mas contigo.  Pues..a si lo dejo.  Te quiero mucho y te mando un beso.

						   I decided that I'm really not good at this blogging thing.  This is for several reasons.  1, My life isn't very interesting. 2, I'm afraid of really posting about my life (Why ?, I don't know.)  and 3, I don't know.  It's not that I don't go online very often.  I spend over 27 hours a week online.  I do have a life but I just don't feel it's very interesting.  Imagine this life..  6:30 am: Wake up & get ready for the day. 8 - 10:15 am: Go to school. 10:30 - 4 pm: Go to work. 4:30 - 6:45: Go to school. After 6:45: Go home, eat, do homework & go to sleep.  This is my schedule Monday through Thursday.  Friday, Saturday, & Sunday I stay with my boyfriend most of the time.  We go out with friends on Friday & Saturday night and get drunk.  During the day on Saturday's I either go swimming or hang out with my dad and nephew.  WOW !!  What a fuckin' life.  That brings it all together.  Basically, my life is a fuckin' bore for other people to read.  I realize that it's boring...but regardless I'm happy.  I read a lot of people's blogs and they are so full of excitement and change.  I don't have guy problems or other issues (which I believe is what makes an interesting read) but I'm so glad I don't.  I'll tell you why..All my life my mom has tried to give me a stable life but unfortunately my dad is the most unstable person in the world..constantly moving, constantly changing.  I've had plently of drama in my first 20 years of life.  Family drama.  Guy drama.  Love drama.  Friend drama. drama. drama. drama.  That's all I had for such a long time.  This past year has been great for me.  I've changed my personality and I've changed the way I react to situations.  I don't want drama anymore.  I'm tired of it.  I don't want to cry.  I don't want to hurt.  I don't want to be afraid.  I just want to enjoy life and my loved ones.  During the past year me and my boyfriend have changed so much...for the better.  I can honestly say we don't fight.  Occasionally, we will  have an argument but we don't let it get past a simple acknowledgment of different opinions.  I'm not jealous anymore.  Jealousy is ugly.  It made me such an ugly person, it wasn't me.  I remember when jealousy controlled my life.  This really stems from the fact that I was not comfortable with myself.  I only have one drama left in my life and that's stupid co-workers..I'll get to that in my next post.  I've got to end my first real entry cuz I've got to go deal with shit @ work.  I'll get back to this next time.

						     And Tomorrow By Tupac Shakur   Today is filled with anger, fueled by hidden hate. Scared of being outcast, afraid of common fate. Today is built on tragedies, which no one wants to face. Nightmares to humanity and morally disgraced. Tonight is filled with rage, violence in the air. Children bred with ruthlessness, cause no one at home cares. Tonight I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops. Knowing that my sanity, content when I'm dropped. But tomorrow I see change, a chance to build a new. Build on spirit intent of heart and ideas based on truth. Tomorrow I wake with second wind and strong because of pride. I know I fought with all my heart to keep the dream alive.

						   Let's see where was I ? hmmmmm..  I was talking about how I don't like who I had become several years ago because I was consumed with jealousy and insecurities.  Anyways, life is good now meaning = a life that sounds boring.  No drama = boring.  Well, today's post will not be that boring..  Last night I was talking to a friend, V whom I was introduced to by...hmmm, we'll call this female bitch.  We used to all be friends but we lost touch with Bitch when she met this abusive guy who would hit her.  I'm so glad that V told me about Bitch cuz I don't need those type of females around me.  I guess she was very curious to know whether or not me and my boyfriend were fucking.  Umm, reminder to her..we're not in high school...half the college is fucking...that is a stupid thing to be curious about.  If she was so fuckin' curious as to how me and my boyfriend are...she should have asked.  Instead she hung out with a bunch of immature guys who would talk about whether or not we fucked.  So these guys would ask her "Do you think they fuck ?" and she would tell these guys that she doesn't know because we aren't even affectionate towards eachother and other comments leaning towards the fact that we are not like a normal couple (I guess what she does with her boyfriend is "normal" - make out, get touchy feely to the point that they look like they're about to fuck, get beat up & all of this is done in front of whoever is around). Umm, sorry bitch, but I've already finished high school and doing what OTHER people think is cool.  I'm not fucking dying of horniness....like her & that fucker who she was talking to....I get  some  of whatever I want whenever I want.  It pissed me off...because I've had to deal with too many stupid females like her.   I've had my share of sneaky jealous females and I don't need any more in my life.  I guess it kind of hit a soft spot for me cuz my best friend let's her boyfriend say stupid shit like..."You better give her love otherwise she's gonna find somebody who will".  Ummmm, excuse me but I love my boyfriend and he loves me.  We don't have to practically fuck in front of everyone so that  they  think that we love eachother. Nobody has any idea what I want or don't want except for my boyfriend.  I'm assuming it's jealousy that consumes people, so they have to find something that they think is wrong.  We don't feel it necessary to show everybody what we do behind closed doors.  He also does not hit me, does not call me names, does not ask me "if I want to suck somebody's dick" for talking to another guy (Bitch who talks shit about how we don't show eachother affection is in a relationship with a guy that does all of these things to her), and we have been going strong for almost 5 years (on November 22nd).  I don't know anybody at my age that has managed to keep a job, go to school,  maintain an relationship with their friends, family, and boyfriend. Amongst all things, I'm happy.   I've had too many jealous bitches try to act like they have the right to say anything....when in all reality, they just wish they had something like what i've got.  Situations like the one with Bitch remind me of this song by Mya called "How you gonna tell me ?" Here's one little quote from the song:   "At least if you're gonna try to give advice about my life,  have your own shit right Cuz you ain't even livin' what you preach to me So please how are you gonna tell me ?"   I had to express my feelings about that...it bothered me so much cuz I was really nice to this girl and she was busy telling everyone we know how she doesn't know why we are together since we don't even seem to like eachother.  Looking at the positive side...At least now I know that when I have a gut instinct about somebody I should listen to it.  I used to always tell my boyfriend...there's something about her that makes me not trust her.  I just couldn't figure out what it was.  I am very naive and can be taken advantage of easily.  It has happened to me many times.  That's why I've got to learn to stay away from people like her.   "Jealousy is a mother fucker, you weak jealous mother fucker !" ~Biggie  Anyways...now that i have that out of my system I feel much better. Life goes on.  I will continue with my great little life...=P

						   Ok, let me give it to you straight.   J.Lo is a typical hispanic girl w/a pear shaped body, hair that grows down (instead of back) right at her hair line, and has no physical feature that is even remotely special.  I don't hate her but I do think she has issues.  She makes people have this idea of latinas, that they are all sluts.  This is obviously a stereotype but she's just making herself look so ridiculous.  When she was with Ojani Noa, she was into "looking hispanic." Notice she sports her natural hair color..  Ex.    When she was with Puff Daddy (whom she met while married to Ojani), all of a sudden she was ghetto and trying to act "gangsta."  Ex.     Then she was with Chris Judd and started dressing w/indian & hippy inspired clothing and a more relaxed look to match his look.    Ex.    Then she meets Ben Affleck and all of a sudden she dresses w/ more class.    EX.     Case closed.  JLo sucks, which brings us to our next topic...Britney.  I was reading this blog...this guy is great !  His blog is so much fun to read.   urlLink VividBlurry  has these really great pictures of Britney and her new fiance.  Here's the link to the pictures...   urlLink Britney, putting more in her mouth and hand...then the usual cigarette.   That is soooo funny...use your imagination.    Anyhow...somehow, I really don't have anything against Britney.  I think she is like many women at her age.  I'm about the same age and most of the things she does is not much different than many girls my age do.  So she likes smoking,drinking, and partying.  So what ?  Everyone at her age is doing most of the same things.  The only thing I think is stupid....is that fact that she doesn't want to sign a prenup with her new Justin-look-alike fiance.  That's just plain stupid !  She's worth so much money, she should have her lawyers decide this type of stuff.    There's another picture of Britney, that  urlLink SmitHappens  (btw..this site is also very funny) has on their site...     In this picture she is probably telling him what she is going to do to do him.  Basically, what it looks like she's doing in the pictures that  urlLink VividBlurry  has.  You would think she would be a little more careful...considering there are so many reporters out there trying to catch her doing something like this.  Or maybe she didn't give a fuck, got caught up in the moment, and know has pictures on the internet to forever remind her of this fun day..=)  Anyways...I felt like bagging on celebrities today.  Probably cuz I'm having one of those days where I feel like a fat ass and wanted to point out other people's imperfections.  Definitely, starting my diet today.  I'm still what is considered "skinny", but this extra weight just doesn't feel right.  I'd rather be fit...than voluptuous.  Ok, I'm done bashing.
