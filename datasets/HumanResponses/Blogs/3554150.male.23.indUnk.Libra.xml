      Since my last entry, I've gained a few highlights and heartaches... Bad first! Leaving FFXI is much harder then I originally thought it would be. All my friends I use to hang with in game, and chat with every minute will soon be near-gone.  "Near-gone" I left them my contact site ( http://www.geocities.com/jegsii/ranjik.html ) so we can still chat it up! But they are all still in game a lot too :P so they are... around, but not near.  HIGHLIGHTS!! :D Who can't be happy about highlights?  My job is selling video games for Gamestop in the mall :P The other day I signed a Commendation that not only did I get a copy for doing very good that week, but a copy got sent to corporate too. Same day I was asked how far I wanted to get in this company from my Manager.  Might not be the best job ever, but if I make it my career, I'm gonna go as far as I can. Telling this to my Assistant Manager, he started teaching me things :D Job is looking (in Strongbad’s voice ( http://www.homestarrunner.com )) very, very good!  Daily news. I've been praying most every morning and night. Tip: Even if you don't believe, I suggest you prey like today is your last. For you never truly know for sure when it will be. And what IF God is real? And if you start believing, what will you lose? Now think about what you'll gain if God IS real! I recommend that if you pray, pray like you mean it. Repent for your sins, yes, we all have 'em. And start believing :) I hope to see YOU in Heaven too.  New/old activity~! :) I'm thinking seriously about my story and my art. Of course I want to be the main creator and designer :P But my current skills suck in both writing and drawing. Reading mangas ( http://www.snoopycool.com ) got me thinking about a lot of things... my story is now far better then it would've been. I can't wait till I start practicing my skills! Which I start today when I go to the mall :P Beware passer-bys, for you may be one of my models for today ;P

      Since last Sunday I've been doing things a little diffrent. The mornings I wake up (~10am!) get a good breakfast, pray, then eat.  Then I reed a few chapters in my Bible. Only about 2-3 pages each time. Then work out :D Do whatever till lunch time, usually errands in town. Get a healthy lunch :) Do whatever till dinner. Usually just chill. If I snack, I find fruits :D ~12am, I'm off to bed. But before I lay down, I pray again. Since Sunday, I've been a little happier :D Everything just feels better then before. I went for a walk in the woods in front of my house. Nice, peaceful, relaxing (till I jump down a cliff and quickly restep a few times while I slide down to the bottom). They cut down soo many trees >< it looks depressing compared to how it use to be... I found a lot of my "land marks". Just things that brought back memorys. They (navy housing) destroyed just about every inch of my old playhouse (my woods)... I should draw up my memorys.

      After about 2 months of straight FFXI playing (final fantasy 11) I finally let it go the begining of this month.  I have many reasons to stop playing all mmorpgs; they eat too much life, I want my real life to be better :P, I want to play other games too!  Now waiting for Spider-Man 2 the game, I've been playing Stronghold.  A game like Starcraft where you build up your army and kill your enemys.  But in Stronghold, you can build your castle anyway you want!  I fear I'm putting too much hipe into Spider-Man 2, and won't like it after I get it :( Here's to hopeing!

      Sorry for the delay... Here is me. Been working at Software Etc. for almost a year now. My numbers were good till I get offered a higher spot in the chain. But the catch is I need better numbers and I have to compete vs someone who pressures peeps into buying his numbers. And since I'd rather be remembered as the nice guy who sucks at making numbers then the mean guy who presures people into getting numbers. :P&nbsp;On a side note. I noticed one of our staff not getting many hours, cuz her number suck. The lower the hours, the lower you'll get in numbers by default. And I worked with her yesterday lol and passed off all my numbers to her. The looks of things. It's time to look for a new job. One that pays more then min. wage, thats fun, maybe even outside. oooOOooo My friend just started painting houses cheaper then everyone else solo. And he agreed to take me in for a lower cut of course. Not only that, but he's already got 12 houses lined up. I'm thinkin, two peeps with full days, charge by the squarefoot, work as much as the sun shines. We can finish houses in just a few days. My friend wants to charge less then everyone else. So he's charging $1/sf.&nbsp;That's not much really compared to what everyone charges. Of course we won't make nearly as much as them. But being this low priced, we should get a lot of jobs. This could be what I've been looking for... :D (the shipyard is still in mind...)

      Today, my day off. I woke up at 3... then at 5pm >< I stayed up at five cuz it was pouring rain! :D it hasn't rained forever. And being Washington, that's horrible. It only rained for about an hour... how lame. I wanted it to rain at least a week. Like it use to... Where is my rain? :(

      My family went to Oregon to spend 4th of July with my moms family. I stayed home to watch the animals and work the weekend. No fireworks for me :D They're pretty and all, but I can do other things to pass my time. Like write in this blog :P chat it up with friends, and later play Spider-Man 2. P.S. if your a fan of GTA's towns, and a fan of Spidie in anyway. Get Spider-Man 2. Or at least rent it.  Have a fun and safe 4th!

      I just got off work. Yep! My first day in my new store with my new promotion. To me, that was a very busy day lol but to everyone else, who've been there much longer, that was a slow day. It was fun not having time to breath and rushing three different directions at once. I can't wait till Halo 2 comes out. Oh, Madden 2005 came out today. I guess that could be why I was zoomin. On a side note, I think it's funny when I get asked for approval. Being my first day, all I could do was smile and say, "Yes! Go for it!" :P not that I should've said no, but it was fun.

      Yesterday, I got a promotion at work! LEVEL UP!! Kinda odd how the day before I was saying I didn't want to get one > And with my lvl increase, I start a new adventure. The new store has been going under cuz of the old manager. Now a new manager is going there to scrap up the place and start from ground zero. He asked me to help. It's gonna be hard, since I have to be mean sometimes :P but besides that, this sounds like fun!  Have a grand day!

      I went to school and sat down by some girl in some class. The teacher came over to me. I think because I was talking to the girl. I told the teacher that not only do I not have the books for her class, but also it may NOT be my class at all. That I only came in because it looked like the same area I thought my first class was, and the door was open. So she (the teach) sent me to the office to get my schedule. Getting it was easy, though someone tried to cut me in a line of two... Me, and the cutter...  I rushed back to that class that has my backpack in it because I knew I'd make it back before the class would end. I took notice that the room number isn't the one on my schedule. Oops! Since class was almost over, I just stayed in the class with the girl I just met. Her and I looked at my schedule and it turned out that my next "class" isn't in my school. Rather, it's a timed study session... in the local library... So after my first "class", the girl I met and I went to her car and she drove me to the Library. On the way giving me crap for the study time and how lucky I was. We parked in front of a huge Library and she brought me inside. She guided me to my study area too.  It turned out it was just a small room with a computer haha I left to the bathroom only to go the wrong way and end up in a theater. There was a movie playing that I didn’t recognize, so I decide to check it out. I went to the back to find a few of my friends are there, including the girl I met in that class. It was pretty fun. Till some guy tried to cause trouble, but got shot down quickly. I forget the details... Anyway, it turned out that the theater had phasing walls. Meaning that you can walk through them. The movie wasn't interesting, so I decided to check out the walls. I walked to the next room, and it was just a big square shaped room. I guess an earthquake hit (I didn't feel anything) and people started rushing the room I was in. I heard some girl say that this room can hold a lot of weight so it's considered the safe room. Right after she finished her sentence, the room started to tip backwards. I looked out the back wall and we weren’t that high... so I jumped out and ran behind some van. It looked like a few cranes were ripping down that part of the theater. And some people got hurt from jumping. Many didn’t get the chance. The girl I met was one of them. They placed her in an ambulance that was waiting for some action from the looks of it. I watched her leave and I slowly followed. Note that I hid from everyone else because they destroyed a place people were in, and somehow, in all the commotion, I lost my shoes... So I ran home... not knowing where to run because the girl drove me there and that town is huge! So I heard my thoughts tell me, "Keep running along the side of the road," and, "Now follow that left road." Later my thoughts tell me that we're lost, and can't guide me unless I'm using my Star Detector. For some reason, my "thoughts" can only see stars. And my detector shows shapes of my surroundings, and "stars" in them. I saw that there was an orange star in the pond by my feet, moving around like a fish or something ate it. Just then I noticed a reflection of a falling star on my detectors screen. So, of course, I made a wish. I wished that my new female friend were all right. The wind blew a little, and my parachute was still in the air. With it up there it was hard to stand still. I saw something fall from the sky and shatter under a naked boy statue’s legs. My detector showed a star there. I figured I should see what it was, and I could use the statue as a guiding point. So I tippie-toed and floated over to it while my parachute pulled me in many directions... I eventually made it. I searched between the statues legs to find nothing but dust, just then the parachute jerks, and the back of my hand knocks off the statues genitals lol My parachute pulling me in every different direction made it impossible for me to get the genitals back to the statue… time passes... Finally I gave the statue a visit from its long lost friend, (I just put them by it's feet >   Have a grand and adventurous day!
