       Ok, this is my first posting ever, but thought that thtis might be good therapy.  I recently completed a year long divorce process that was very combative and also extremley heart-breaking.  The woman that I was madly in love with and wanted to spend the rest of my life with decided that she no longer wanted to married to me.  To add insult to injury, she decided to do this AFTER we had an incredible son who is now 2.5 years old.  The divorce is final and I am now dealing with the emotional (I want to call it a post-partum or ??) depression where I cannot seem to get out of a hole that I seem to be in; my job absolutly sucks, I am having cash problems (not sure how I am going to make next month's mortgage payment), every job interview I go on to get out of the hell hole I am in turns out that they are looking for a junior person and I am dating someone who wants to married.  While the last item is good from the standpoint that someone else loves me enough to say that they want to spend the rest of their life with me, it is something that I A) am not currently emotionally ready to tackle, and B) I am DEATHLY afraid of ever getting married again.  So, here I am on Monday night, having a drink (alone) and pondering where my life is going, how am I going to survive financially, trying to find out what MY purpose in life is and what I need to do in order to FIND it, and how can I get back into the saddle to start LIVING again!!  I use to be very gregarious, outgoing, excited and wanted to live life to the fullest.  Now, I want to sit home, watch tv and do NOTHING -- how pathetic is that!!!!?????  I used to ride my bike 100 - 200 miles a week, and I haven't been on my bike in alomst 5 months!!  I miss those rides, time to reflect, time to work out and time to get out the aggression that I had (and still have) towards my ex for breaking up our family.  My job is all but worthless.  I work for a company that had the infrastrucure to be best company in the Pacific Northwest in out field and the new owner's ego caused it to be flushed down the toilet.  Now, we are just trying to survive.  We have at one time 12 sales people and now I am the only one left and I am just trying to get the FUCK out of there, but anything I look at is either entry level and anytime I try to step up a notch, they say that I do not have the right type of experience that they are looking for.  So, I am either stuck with staying with my current employer, move to a competitor, or take the big leap and risk everything to start my own company with no capital and try to make it.  On top of all of this, I am trying to care for our son.  Anyway, this is all for now.
