      Behind the door they stand, smiling at me like a long lost friend.&nbsp; Cookies for me and them.&nbsp; They look relaxed and happy, the memory of him surrounds us in the hugs and smiles.&nbsp; His friends and family remember him with donations to us, helping us to make our place more a home than a place.&nbsp; Tears threaten as we promise to visit, plan a lunch, a day.&nbsp; He is our glue, though he's gone he stays in our hearts and keeps us together.

      It's been a while since I told her story.&nbsp; Tragic though sadly, not unique.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone endures profound sadness in their lives.&nbsp; I finished the whole of it without tears, though they threatened at times.&nbsp; Sharing her with my friends, though they'll never meet, bonds us in yet another way through our hearts if not our bodies.&nbsp; They would enjoy each other, her and my friends we could have had many fun outings, it's not to be.&nbsp; I'll share her stories, they will know her through my eyes, they will wish they had known her.&nbsp; They see her in me, my face resembles hers.&nbsp; My attitude was built by her, my morals given by her.&nbsp; She is in me always, and in all ways.

      Five years.&nbsp; My heart aches with her memory.&nbsp; I dream of her often, her smile always in place.&nbsp; Sometimes I wake up crying, from missing her and needing her in my life.&nbsp; I remember the future, all that I will miss with her.&nbsp; I grieve for me, not her.&nbsp; She's at peace, no more pain, no more agony.&nbsp; There are days I wonder how I'll make it without her smiles, her wisdom and her arms.&nbsp; There are days anger takes over and God becomes my enemy, ripping my heart away from me far too soon, stripping the core of our family away from us.&nbsp; We don't deserve this, we don't.&nbsp; She does.&nbsp; She deserves to have Him, she deserves the peace.&nbsp; She is still watching, I feel it in my soul, sometimes it helps...today isn't one of those times.&nbsp; I miss her.

      A job, career, paycheck. Getting involved with families, residents, life from before.  Before this awful disease takes away all that they have, all that they were day by day, year by year. Beautiful wife and family, gone only in their mind always by their side, trying to catch glimpses of what the disease rips away without consideration of the hearts involved.  They wait for death to come, to take away the pain of watching their love disintegrate before their eyes taking away the beauty of their lives. I see only what the disease takes, what Alzheimers destroys.  I treat the body and try to create the best home I can.  I can only sustain life, because it's not living.  A smile in the morning, gentle touch as I do what I need to keep them healthy.  Healthy enough for the disease to continue to destroy.  It'll never be just a job, career or paycheck.  It breaks my heart, and heals it hour by hour, day by day.  They include me in their families, but not until the end, not until I've lost the battle in  keeping the body alive. But they win, the sooner the better.
