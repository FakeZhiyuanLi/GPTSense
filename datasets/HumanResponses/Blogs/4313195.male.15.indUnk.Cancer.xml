      yes, the metal seen is exploding and a lot of new and very good bands are appearing world-wide!!! if you are new to the metal scene i suggest you check out some of the following artists: Metallica (a must), Pantera, Dream Evil, Iced Earth, Slipknot, Bleeding Through, Atreyu, Slayer, God Forbid, Lamb Of God, Shadows Fall, HIM, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish!  These are a lot of the main leaders of the metal world...I also suggest you check out the "Metal for the Masses" CDs available at Hot Topic! These CDs have a lot of music from various metal artists! also the price is excellent (around $5)..so if your new to metal i suggest you check out the "Metal for the Masses' CDs first and then go into individual bands!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  OK for the few people who read this... I went to Ozzfest and it was fucking awesome! we got there just as soon as Magna-Fi started... It was great except for one thing.... the fucking croud was push happy.... everytime a band came on they turned the whole croud into a push pit... which it not very fun!  I mean if you wanna be in the pit make your way over to the fucking pit! dont start one with people who dont want to be in the pit in the first place! it's like what the fuck!!!! and the crowd surfers were very "friendly" trying to go up when the people in front of them are not even aware that they are trying to get up...so they get hit with the body!  I was introduced to a few bands there also... God Forbid, Lamb Of God, Bleeding Through....all of those i picked up while at ozzfest! it was great, but unfortunately i had to leave early because my cousins and i were suffering because of the sun... and i didnt like the smoking very much (i don't smoke and never plan to). So we left after black label society finished (the first band on the main stage).  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Again, for all you fuckers that are new to the metal scene, I also suggest reading some metal magazines...my personal favorite is "REVOLVER." it has a lot of good shit in it!  A lot about new bands, good bands, and news about shit! and some very useful ads in the back! Its been one day and i dont even think i have gotten a hit yet!  w00t i own...

       This is my first blog....its gonna own all you bitchhole mothersuckers!   I don't know what im gonna put in this blog...probably shit about music...the only good music: metal!!  yes...metal owns all living creatures on earth...powerful lyrics, meavy music, loud vocals...it all owns....those fuckers who listen to pussy ass music like rap...only like it because they think it makes them tough....and it has a beat slow enough for them to nod their fucking heads to....  but no other music compares to real life like metal...  how many people have actually been a gangster and live in the ghetto and have gotten shot? ...not many  but how many people have had hard times in their life, whether it was loosing a loved one...being an outcast...thinking there was no way out but to kill themselves..... most likely a lot more than there are gangfuckers....  i have come to a decision to make the blog about one of the greatest things on earth...metal music!
