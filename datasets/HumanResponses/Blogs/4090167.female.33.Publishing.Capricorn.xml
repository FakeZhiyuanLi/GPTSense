      I'm starting this a couple of hours before my first personal training session with Mo the Boot Camp Lady. Or so she says. Apparently she screams at people.   For sixty bucks an hour, which I think is fairly reasonable, she's going to develop a routine for me that will get me back to my pre-meds, pre-commuting weight. Which is, and I'm trying to be reasonable, about 170lbs. A good weight for someone of my height, which is a hair or two shy of 5'11". Shoeless. When I'm being unreasonable, which is generally all of the time, I'd prefer to be about 160lbs.   So there are a few strands in that paragraph that could stand a tug or two. Over the next few weeks and months each one of them is going to get yanked in one way or another. Do I start now? I can at least put out the facts, the stuff that's empirically true.   I've been on medication for bipolar II since August of 2001. It's always been the same meds, just different doses. I was originally on 750mg of Divalproex (Epival to those who don't think generically) and 200mg of Wellbutrin (no generic equivalent there). A few twists and turns later, I'm essentially on 375mg of Divalproex and 300mg of Wellbutrin. Discussions about attendant weight gain and some links to interesting studies and articles might appear in the future. Might not, depending on my ability to focus on one thing at a time. See above re diagnosis.   I've been commuting roughly an hour each way to and from work since February of last year, and I purchased my first car in June 2002, though I was about a half hour's transit commute from work at the time. I also biked to and from when the mood struck, but once I had the car it didn't happen so often. Not unexpectedly, weight gain ensued, though the timeline makes it difficult to isolate things.   This brings us to the present. What happens now, empirically speaking?   I'm moving from Divalproex to Lamotrigine (Lamictal) and possibly off of Wellbutrin as a result. It does not have any known impact on weight, nor does it impair cognition like so many bipolar drugs do, but it has one nifty side-effect that tends to keep people away, which is the possibility of spontaneously combusting. Or some such thing. Could be as minor as a rash that resembles a mild sunburn, could be as serious as third-degree burns, and some people have died. Yup.  I'm working my ass off to try to get a job back downtown again. Working more activity into my day is always a better way to lose weight than to hit the gym and then sit my ass in a car for 40km. I like the gym very much, and I am looking forward to whatever it is that my trainer puts me through, but I'd like to walk home again, or bike, or take the streetcar. Maybe I'm romanticizing it, but since I've been in the workforce I've worked downtown, until last February. There are a couple of possibilities at present, we'll see how they pan out.   That's it for the facts. The rest is perception, self-image, standards that originate somewhere not here but are taken to heart nonetheless, and an inability to do much more than perch on an idea when I really ought to settle right into it, ugly truths be damned.   As for the name of this thing, it is a good song. From Cake's first album. It also can be applied, in a rather pedestrian but refreshingly take-charge kind of way, to my weight. But most importantly, it's how I feel when I know a depressive episode of some sort is going to hit. They don't really hit, they envelop me. As they come from a higher place than just an average mood the down-ness feels worse for it. I could have called the blog "nameless dread", I suppose, but I wanted something that could be taken as at least a bit cheery.

      Being in a car for an hour at a crack does have its advantages. You forget that you can't actually use your legs. Ankles, sure, even a bit of calf.  Getting out of the car after an hour has many disadvantages. Like trying to heave myself up on legs that are working at about a quarter of their usual strength.   And then there are the you-could-stage-a-musical-here-with-twenty-five-can-can-dancers stairs in my office. Not pretty.  Yes, I saw my trainer again last night and, I imagine it's clear, she worked my quadriceps. Holy fuck did she work them. You know that faux chair thing you can do against a wall? My legs were twitching like mad but I had to hold it for a minute. Doesn't sound like much, and it didn't when I first started, but after doing another round of squats and various self-esteem boosting things like frog-hopping around the gym floor and returning to the wall for another faux chair? More faux than chair, this time.   And then there were the push-ups. Or what passed for them. After doing far too many sets of flys (I get the feeling that's how it's spelled, though flies, which are irritating, certainly suits), when I thought that whole one set to failure thing was all the rage right now, push-ups basically did me in. My body said "fuck this, I'm bringing on the dizzies and nausea now, don't say I didn't warn you", and off I went to the recumbent bike to drink water and nibble on ginger snaps until I felt like I could stand and also regain my peripheral vision. Ugh. This in the name of fitness?  I get it. More muscle burns more calories. And as La said, people want results fast, so pushing them harder than they likely push themselves will speed things along. But there is a limit to what people can do and what they'll remain motivated to do, even with a trainer who rides your ass daily by cell phone.   I'm pleased that I didn't sign up for 10 sessions. Saving about 60 bucks on a bill of over 600 bucks doesn't strike me as a great deal. I'm signed up for 4 of them, the next one's tomorrow.   What do I think so far? Personal trainers are annoying with catch phrases and so on, and ultimately it is just a sales grab that takes advantage of people's desire for change but lack of desire for self-motivated change, but, as with many things, it helps to hear stuff from other people. Like, for instance, more muscle burns more calories. I knew this, but did I do more weights at the gym? No, I spent all of my time on cardio.  My fear? This won't make a damn bit of difference, because even if I train with her for two days a week and do cardio for at least two other days, I'm still on Divalproex and I'm still commuting every day. La wants me to try transit, which will give me some zone-out time, but that's at least two hours each way. Maybe I can catch a ride with someone on the way in or home. Probably in, because there's no time limit at the other end. Beyond having dinner before 9pm. Which sucks. But still.  Defeatist, aren't I. Say it's typical of my affliction, but there it is in any case. Boot Camp Lady said something interesting about this: she found that just when she was making headway with weight loss or fitness or whatever, she'd hit a wall, which would usually come in the form of an injury, lots of distraction in other parts of her life, or other things that would broadside her. And she'd be back where she started, or worse, in no time. Like people who lose weight and gain it back and more. She thinks she's coming to figure out what's stopping her, which sounds as though it has to do with self-esteem, mom issues, that sort of thing, and as a result the wall won't exist anymore.   I get that. I'm not sure I know the halfway between willfully not giving a shit (it is possible to feel that way) and giving it my absolute all in an unhealthy way.   And, yes, to the casual observer that too would be typical of my affliction. Shut up.

      It's unfair to think that you can adhere to any sort of set nutritional plan when you're hanging out with parents. Particularly if by necessity the revised nutrional plan suggests alcohol and plenty of it. Most definitely unfair to think you can adhere to the rules of ettiquette, for that matter, when you're visiting with not one but two sets of parents, each with noisy grandsons that have the benefit of giving you something to talk about but are nonetheless noisy.  Hence the salty crunchy stuff, in this case  urlLink Hint of Lime Tostitos . Yummers. Though my lips have puckered to about half their volume with attendant bloating in my mid-section. Argh.  Anyhow. This is a long weekend, which is why I'm back on Sunday night. Tomorrow is laundry day, all day, but at least it's not a forced smile on my face day, all day. And for that, yay.  I don't feel like talking about parents. The newphew is cute, he can hold his head up now but still does weird interpretive dance moves with his arms and legs while you're holding him.  Anyhow. Saw the boot camp lady on Friday. I was rushed getting there, she was rushed because she had to scram early, so we changed it to a half-hour session where she took measurements and we mapped out some meal plans. Big on protein and fibre, moderate to low on carbs, way low on starch. Not so easy to do as a herbivore, but I'll swing it. Soy milk is a major part of my diet already, which helps.  I stayed at the gym after we talked and did 50 minutes of cardio. Half on an elliptical trainer, keeping an rpm of at least 60 and my heart rate at about 135 bpm or so; half on a treadmill, varying inclines, about 3.5 mph and my heart rate kind of hung out at 135 bpm there, as well. Nothing wrong with that.  I'd like to do something tomorrow beyond hauling laundry, particularly because of the beer n' chips diet, but I doubt it will happen. Ah well.  Reason the second for not wanting to commute so far anymore: some sort of RSI in my right knee from switching between the gas and brake pedals in rush hour traffic. Lovely, yes?
