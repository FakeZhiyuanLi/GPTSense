      I'm now going to talk about stuff...people...things... Instead of going to bed.  Tomorow I'm going on a picnic with friends Diana and Merlinda. That'll be really fun, they're both great great people and they're both going through a LOT... Diana's hanging in there and doing better, but Merlinda, gah, I'm so worried for her, she wasn't at school today, and she told me if she doesn't feel better about life and stuff she's not going to come to school... so she doesn't feel better. Mmmf, I sure hope she makes it through this god-awful time... she's such a great person, it's so sad to see her enter a classroom without her smiling face. So I'll do what I can to turn her frown upside down.  Actually, I try to do that with everyone. I'm a natually happy guy for the most part, and I like others to be happy too. I don't know, people always seems happy to see me and they always say that after they see me they always feel better, and I think that's great. Really, if anyone says that to me I feel like I've done my duty! Because I feel like it's my life's purpose. Kind of ironic, actually... I preach to myself (and to other people, if I'm in a certian mood) that humans should be more like animals, that Survival of the Fiddest isn't in action anymore and that's sad. Really, I wish I was a cat... or a dog, fish or bird... I wish we were all animals. That's one thing I have to disagree with religious people on... most of them think God created them and that humans were a miracle, but I don't think humans are a miracle at all... I think we were just a circumstance, that because too intelligent. I believe Survival of the Fiddest should still be in action.   ...and if it was, I'd be pretty damn dead. My dream is to be a psychologist, and to make others happy. But come ON! Is that job going to help me in the down and dirty world we should be living? Gah, of course not. But people try to diagnose every problem, try to figure out every process, try to identify every single thing in the world and give it a scientific name... and so there are Shrink's. I'm such a contradiction. I'll bet if we really were all as intelligent as cats and Survival of the Fiddest were in full action, I'd wish we learned more. Really, it's a vicious cycle. I guess I'm lucky humans know so much. But how are we really any better then animals? For making technology and curing diseases and stuff? Well sure, but we wouldn't have half these diseases in the first place if we got more dirty and rolled around in the dirt more often. I'm serious, they even have this pill that puts a germ in your system to strenghen your immune sysetem.  If we were all as smart as cats, there wouldn't be any prejudice, religion, or facts. But we'd be able to be creatures of our instinct... we'd be crawling on all fours like were suppostod to (that's why humans have bad backs) and squatting to go poop. We'd all sleep together, too, in a great big pile o' people! We're suppostod to do that too... that's why yawns are contagious. Sleep is a comunial activity!  Interesting rant I came on, eh? Surprisingly that's not what I sat down at the computer to talk about... but I finally showed something about my opinion I'm pretty damn sure of, that I thought of myself.  But I'd now like to talk about Danielle, a very interesting person I know.  This last semester our friendship has been on the rocks, many, many times. Something happens, she gets mad at me. Soemthing happens, I get mad at her. Something happens, she gets mad at me. Yada, yada, yada. Really, out of all those times I only got really mad once... but that just may be because i'm at fault more then she is.  We ended off on fine terms last semester, but when school started this semester... I found I didn't miss her. I found I didn't really want to be her friend that much. It's sad, really, because I want to help her smile, I really do, but I don't know... she shouldn't be able to trust me any more, and I know I can't really confide in her. It's just rough because before this school year started I meant to much to her, I made her so happy, and I was glad I did. Then all these things came along... and I guess that's just not true anymore. I guess the events changed the both of us. It is kind of sad, really... but I just don't feel that she needs me anymore. I really do just think of her as a patient, that she'd come to me if she needed me. But I don't think she's come to me, I don't think she's needed me.  She's talked about suicide many, many a time... it's rather scary. She's tried to, or so she says, and it never successful. But if she was... man, I'd feel horrible. I'd probably feel worse then anyone there (except for maybe Chip. but since she's a Christian now he's going to believe that she's saved, so he won't feel bad at all.). I'd feel like I failed. Like it was my job to prevent her from killing herself, and I wasn't successful. What if I could of made her happy, what if I couldn't make a difference, but didn't, because of my own damn influence by others and my stupid blabberish mouth. I'm trying to change that, I've kept plenty o' secrets these days... but I just can't value ones that I think are stupid or can talk about with other people. Yeah, if Danielle killed herself i'd feel awful... I really would.   K, now I have to end on a positive note! Uhh... letsee... oh gah, Drama was a blast today! I love that class so freaking much... the people in there are all drama nuts, so they're all such great people! Today we did improv... it was so fun, and so funny, I think it was more funny then we've ever done before. Really, I think we otta start an improv team... we could have so much fun and we could put on lil' shows and stuff. but I hope Needham wouldn't direct it... his improv skills are fine but his games are so... ordered, improv should be free and flow like the wind! Perhaps Laura's mom? Meh, we'd have to see. Be really cool, though.   I really am pretty tired. I think I'll get some cookies and creme ice cream and then head to bed. yay! weekend!   -everybody's favorite Sam

      Yay! There's a part of Kalideoscope where now I get to go insane! Like my last five lines are like Steve Bouchemi in Armageddion. That'll be really fun... but I'm afraid it'll be more funny then serious.  Burn, Captain... burn!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bwahhahahaha...

      So Kaleidoscope got completely new blocking... again. Now we're in a nice little circle... but that's all I want to say about it for now, after all, some of you may come see it... there's something a little more serious I want to touch on tonight.  I was going to talk in this whole lot rant about my inability to make decisions. But I realized it’s not my inability to make decisions, I can do that reasonably well, it’s my lack of holding an opinion. I can never really stand up and argue my opinions that well. Maybe it’s just that the opinions I form are never strong enough? Even if something just is a certain way (i.e. Havok and Annie a couple in Uncanny X-Men, I loathe that paring), I’ll read something (talking about how great Havok and Annie a couple are, and that that’s the best thing about Uncanny X-Men) and feel persuaded, just for a second. Then I’ll think about it and go “hey!”  I’m never sure enough of myself. All I really know for sure if what my gut tells me… if I’m suddenly mad at someone for some reason, the reason I am mad at them will be my opinion, hands down… until they apoligze, or I feel guilty, in which case it doesn’t hold through.   I mean it’s not a terrible thing to not have a clear opinion. But I just get so amazed when I look at Ian’s forwardness. He’s so confident with everything he thinks about, so sure of himself. I’d like that sureness. And while I don’t exactly want to be as foreword as Ian is about his beliefs (check out www.jesussucks.blogspot.com if you don’t believe me), I do wish I was secure with something. Meh, who knows.  I also have a lack of will power. Heh, quite a lack if you ask me. If I’m really excited about a show, the first thing I do is go to spoilers online for that show (7 times out of 10 it’s 24, 3 times out of 10 it’s Smallville)! I just can’t resist it! It makes my family go ballistic, though… especially my brother. He has made it incredibly clear how much lack of shame I have for going to spoilers. Heh.  I don’t mind my lack of will power, which is really too bad. I actually use it to my advantage, because I know that I wouldn’t have the will power to stop if I enjoyed drugs or alcohol. So I use fear of the unknown to prevent me from doing what isn’t healthy, because I simply do not trust my will power.  Getting up in the morning is also a lack of will power. I’ve been lying in bed for 10 minutes after when the alarm goes off, and yet I just don’t want to move. I know I may be late for school. But it’s cold, and I simply do not want to get out of bed! So I don’t. Until 5 more minutes, that is. I usually get to school on time too, but I have to rush, which I’d rather not.   Maybe I have some will power, I just give in to guilty pleasures too easily. Heh, at least I’m aware of it. I really don’t mind, I just feel like I’d be a slightly better person if I did have will power. But enough putting me down, I’m going to talk about people who make me happy now.  I’m putting my thoughts tonight out to my friend Shelly. (christy’s sister, to all those keeping score) Her friend Chris was apparently killed by a drunk driver, or something along those lines. Anyway, one of Shelly’s best friends is dead, and that really is a sad thing. Such a young age to die, and Shelly is such a young age (she’s a sophomore) to have to deal with death of a friend. I really hope she makes it through this.  And to all star classic X-Men artist Dave Cockrum, who is in the hospital with pneumonia. I hope he gets out of there soon.   My, this was one of my darker posts! I think I better head to go. But before I do, an advertisement for my next upcoming story (may be co-written with Devinda).  A vampire, a gargoyle, a frankenstein, a ghost, a zombie, an alien, a werewolf. Seven monsters, each with a story of their own, come together by a 17 year old boy, trying to change the concepts of monsters everywhere.   “SIN SEVEN” (hella tentative title) COMING SOON!   Heh… sounds a little cheesy. But trust me, I think it’ll be really cool. I’m putting a lot of thought into it.   Oh, what’ll happen to The Last, you ask? Uh… I’ll still write it, probably. Maybe there’s someone in the fiction press world who wouldn’t mind writing chapters 6-10? I got an idea to change the direction of the story, perhaps I could end my direction and someone takes over for me while I’m writing Sin Seven. We’ll just have to see!   Good night, all.

      I'm chainging my name to "mutiny of one" until Kalideoscope is over. Then I'll probably switch back to Strangly Simple, or as my friend Daniel suggested, Simply Complicated. Personally, I prefer Complicadely Simple... they're both pretty good, and both very oxymoronic, which is great. My web adress will remain the same, but the title will change. I just now realized how cool mutiny of one sounded!  Today was good. We're back to doing one hour of Kalideoscope a day, today's hour was great. But...we just found out we're not going to be able to use ladders. Needham even suggested Roller Blades/Skates... but only like 2 of us have pairs and it'd be all expensive... plus we'd have to freaking learn how to roller blade! That's all right. I'll die alone, thanks, at one hundred thousand miles per hour. ...sorry. going into a line again?  If you lost your teeth, which of the following would you use as a replacement? a. Toothpicks b. Dentures c. Hard spagetti noodle d. Marchmellows  Tough one, huh. heh. that's a question on our fake test, in This Is A Test. Another one:  7. Who is your favorite teacher? a. Mrs. Williams b. Mrs. Williams c. Mrs. Williams d. Mrs. Williams e. Mrs. Williams  That one's really hard. Especially since, according to Pat, the answer is Truman. anyway!  I had a couple weird dreams saturday night, when I slept around 12 hours. In the morning I kept on waking up, being tired, and going back to sleep, like 3 times. So in the morning I drempt, and remember those quite well the next day. In one of them, we were doing Les Mis again, for some reason. Only in my dream auditions weren't by singing and what not- they were by jumping on a rope, and whichever section you landed on was the part you got. I had remembered going on the rope and landing successfully in the Thenardier section! So I was trying for that again. I got on the rope, and my watch was cought on the rope, so I fell and hit the ground. Then suddenly, I think my legs fell off! But then my watch said "ADAMANTIUM LEGS" and apperiently my old legs were replaced with... adamantium legs. heh. who knows. So I didn't quite make it to the Thenardier part, but I did touch a leaf that was in that section. And since Thenardier aperiently has an adamantium skeleton... having adamantium legs was to help me get the part. After I landed I went and pleaded to Needham, and he gave me the part! I was really happy, I went home and I was sure to make it my name on MSN!  As Jennika says, at UHS, the first thing you do after you get a part in a show, it make it your screen name on MSN. or at least... that's what she and I and Naomi do. I think we're the only people on MSN who are involved in drama. Eh, aww well. (shrug)  So my Plunger broke off. It is now away from my heart, disloged into a private coroder I call a pocket. But! Jennika made me a new neclace... by taking the rope from my old nechlace and putting one of the pen grips she gave me on it. It's very nice, a suitable replacement to the plunger. Forever? Hmm, I don't know. Gotta think about making a The Cheat neclace. (by the way visit www.homestarrunner.com for the best web cartoons this side of the universe)  mmm hmm mmm hmm mmm hmm, all right, one more thing  I was hanging out with Naomi, Jennika, and Mikayla, and Naomi and Jennika went to the restroom. So Mikayla and I stayed outside and suddently acted all secret-agenty, with guns, and hiding in courners and all that stuff! We stood close to the coundries of the doors of the restroom, ready to "shoot" jennika and nao when they came out! Well, the first person to come out wasn't Jennika... or Nao... it was Christin! I did the stance anyway, and she jumped! So we waited a while... and listened to Naomi belt out "AND IIIIII.... OH I, WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOUUUUU!!" heh. that was funny. but then Jennika came out and she was so scared she fell over! Heh. that was great! We continued acting all stealthy all the way to the other Music Building and back, jumping over the blue lines, pretending they were lazers! O, how childish we were acting and o, how much fun it was. heh. we gotta do that again sometime.   Oh, yeah, The Last chapter 5 is up. Check it out! (www.fictionpress.com search for Sokkonn)  Well, that's all I've got to say today. Have fun all.

      http://www.fictionpress.com/~normalbird79 read this guys story. It's amazing... depressing and long, a little disgusting, but very engrossing. I had something longer here before, but it closed somehow, and I don't want to type it all up. Maybe later. For now, go start that story.

      Trying to make my Blog format into that neato giant golf ball... come ON, Giant Golf Ball, what would be better!?!  So the formal was pretty fun. Nothing that amazing, nothing amazing really happened... but it was pretty fun. Before the formal was even more fun, though! I arrived at Dichicos (spelling really bad) at like 5:45, a good 15 minites late. Moti was all ready there (heh, yeah, we all thought she looked like an S&M Dominatrix girl... Moti didn't mind! she did look very very great though... got her makeup and hair all done) so we sat down, looked over on the menu, and after discovering we both have a love for black olives, we quicly decited upon sharing a small black olive pizza. Anthony and Erin hadn't arrived yet, so we waited for them to come to order. A little bit after 6, they finally came, saying "Do you know how many DiChicco's there are!?!?" hah! That's what I had assumed happened. It was funny, Moti and I were trying to reach Anthony, but we didn't know his cell phone number... but I was sure it was 248-61 something something. so we tried all these combinations, with no luck, and it turns out even THAT was wrong! Heh, good times.   So we got our food, ate it, Moti went to the restroom, Erin followed, and then they came back and then... went for a walk. What? Why did they go for a walk? What could they possibally have to do? Anthony and I couldn't think of any good reasons... but then there turned out to be a really good reason that I probably shouldn't mention here. Let's just say Erin's purse was stuffed full of... things... for Moti. heh. heh. heh.  So after after that we went to the dance! We stepped in, and... "Hey! No one's here! No music is playing! What's going on?" so then Needham corrected us, saying "It starts at 8, guys, go have fun and come back." "Oh... okay..." so then we went off to Starbucks, Anthony and Erin got their stuff... then we went to Jamba Juice... usually I hate Jamba Juice, but right now they have Cherry Smoothies! Mmm! Cherry! That's the best!  What was really funny was we were standing outside it, and I saw that they were advertising Cherry stuff, so I said "Cherry!" But they thought I was looking at the guy working their, and that I said "Jerry!" instead of cherry. So they said "Do you know him?" "What? No, of course not. Where did you think that??" heh. Anyway Moti and I got some smooties. They were very good.  Even the car ride was fun. Heck, the car ride was probably the most fun of all.  "DAY! ME SAY DAY ME SAY DAY ME SAY DEEEOO... DAYLIGHT COME AND ME WANT TO GO HOMEEEE!" really, really loudly. That was a blast.   Afterwords I went to Jena's house... we saw War Of The Roses, which is a very, very strange movie... I can't tell if I've bettered myself from watching from the movie or if it was senceless. Meh, it's a Danny DeVito film, why bother figuring out the point of it anyway?   I sure hope I'll get to talk with Rachel today. She's been down lately... several things bothering her, and when I talked to her Thursday night I really didn't help. Hopefully she's all happy and all better!  Now, I'm off to trim my toenails. I'll bet you all wanted to know that!

      I'm going to talk about death real quick. I think I have two different views on it and so I thought I'd mention them to the Blog.  Sometimes death seems like a no big deal thing to me. I mean, people die. So? Of course, no one lives forever. A bunch of people die every day! What isn't it like every 19 seconds someone dies? No big deal.  But... it doesn't happen to me or most everyone I know at all. I haven't talked to some old friends in a while. Well, are they dead now? Probably not. It would be a SHOCK for me to hear the news of their demise! Heck, it's a shock to me if anyone I know dies.   But why? Death is no big deal. It happens all the time. But I think I feel that if death happens all the time, why hasn't it happened to the people I know more often? Sometimes in the newspaper I read that a young person died. That makes me sad. Why? Didn't I just say it was no big deal? Gah, I don't understand. If death is everywhere, why is it such a shock if someone dies? Why is it we always expect people to be living if we haven't talked to someone for a while?  Because it takes something to happen for someone to die. But then why do so many die? gah.  Meh! This is somewhat morbid. I'd be nice to get into understanding of death for Kalideoscope... because, trust me, there is a LOT of it in that.   I wonder, what are Applegate's (my role) views on death? He probably doesn't care about it that much.  I don't know! Anyway, I'm about to go to pre-formal dinner, so I'll sign off and post again later about how the formal goes. Wish me luck.

      And here I am again, the next day. Pretty good, no? I just always think of things to say... thoughts I could simply think about or... I could type them on my Blog!  So I'm putting my other project, Rebound 3, on hiatus for now (hopefully Taylor, my co-writer COUGHslackerCOUGH will write something) because I've been writing The Last right now... yeah, I don't think I can write more then one project at a time. Here's a link to the story: http://www.fictionpress.com/read.php?storyid=1299425  I do have some doubt about Rebound 3. We'd film it next summer, and last summer it was hard enough to arrange... but with a cast that's even larger then before and some people questionable about it, I'm not positive it's going to happen. If it doesn't, Taylor and I are prepared to write something different. We play a little game in our daily life, a sort of CIA-esc game, with moles and spys and all that good stuff which could very well make a find movie. Or, I could do what my buddy Naomi had suggested... which is making a movie out of The Last.  Hmm! I had never thought of that! It could be really really cool... casting it and everything... finding people in real life to play characters I made up... that's pretty cool. I'll just see how the story goes, and see how good of a screenplay I could make.   Ah, I feel stupid. I complained about not doing enough Kalideoscope and doing so much This Is A Test... but today we had 2.5 hardcore hours of Kalideoscope goodness! It was great! We started doing all sorts of new blocking stuffs... we learned things, worked with them, then worked with them again in front of like 15 students! That was crazy. First time we had a reasonably big audience. I think it went very well.  I thought I had something more I wanted to say, but I can't seem to think of it right now... eh, I'll just talk about tomorrow.  Crazy day, tomorrow will be. I get to watch Words,Words,Words and Maybe This, Maybe, That, the two other One-Acts I am not involved in. Plus we'll be going This Is A Test and Kalidescope in front of everyone... whew! that'll be crazy. Then later in the day is the formal! I'm excited. Sounds like Erin and Anthony are eating dinner with myself and Moti beforehand, which will be fun... and her 15 friends will be fine!  Moti and I are very comfertable with eachother. We're in the same boat on many aspects of life, and hence, we're real good buddies. I'm sure to have a blast tomorrow.   I'm going to now type about how awesome Jennika is... gah, she gave me PEN GRIPS! I love those things. I stole hers ilke twice on Tuesday, so then yesterday she gives me 3 of them! So... cool! and she wrote a secret note in my script... and after having to wait to read it (she told me to wait till I got home to read it), I anciously opened the book and found...  "I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas"  LOL! That really made my day.  Yeah, I think that's all I type tonight. Have fun.

      Wow... hey everyone. I guess I'm creating a new Blog now. The website seems to be working fine, so that's good! Maybe I'll keep it updated.   I fall for peer pressure far too well, espcially when they gang up on me. It was unintentional, but a lot of my friends did indeed gang up on me! Rachel, and Sarah wanted me to get one of these... and today (1/7) I felt really inspired, as I told Rachel, my muse worked overtime tonight! So I decited to give in, and make a Blog. Tada!  Right now I'm in the Winter session, and I'm in two one acts, Kalideoscope and This Is A Test. Since it's intersession, all day every day's an elective. O! How great it is! I come home and I'm always so, so happy... drama is truely something I have a really strong passion for. I love being Applegate so freaking much, it's so fun being the living manifistation of the devil... or at least that's what I think of the character. Really, my life is now dominated by Kalideoscope. I hear and say lines wherever I go, and many scenes in life remind me of the show, and whenever we get to do a run through... oh, it's great. But, alas, we only do it for an hour a day. ;_;. Yeah, it's going really well and that's all the time we need... but I want to do it more! Especially when I'm just sitting there in This Is A Test... awaiting the time where I get to... GASP! Can it be... The one time, where I get to... SNEEZE TWO TIMES! Oh! The best part of the whole show! (actually, there's a different part that I love even more... but I'm not telling anyone that... it's going to be a surprise!) Anyway, yeah, This Is A Test can be very boring, simply sitting there for... 3 seconds. I wonder, will they look, will they see? Let's go, find, OUT!  Ah. sorry. I suddenly had to work in a line from Kalideoscope. It's not even my line... but yeah, let's take it back... Anyway, yeah, This Is A Test can be very boring, simply sitting there for like 45 minites. I do get to do some stuff, and the stuff I do do is fun, but let's look at this...   I have several lines in Kalideoscope. I am in 27/35 pages. I have no lines in This Is A Test. I am in 0/??? pages.  My character has a name in Kalideoscope. My character has no name in This Is A Test, actually, he doesn't really excist. He's just a "student". meh, I'm naming him Paul!  We do Kalidoscope once a day. We do This Is A Test three times a day.  Gah! Something does not compute!  I probably shouldn't complain so much. I probably don't even need to be there all those three times, and there really is a lot more to work on in This Is A Test then in Kalideoscope. I shouldn't complain... but damn it (role call anyway), I'm going to anyway!  So that's what's taking up my life at this time. There isn't that much else going on, other then the formal on Friday... that's going to be very intristing. Moti's bringing 15 friends. Yeah, 15 freaking friends. They're all drama people and probably all very cool, but... 15!? Meh, at least they're not all going to the dinner beforehand. It won't be that bad.    Hollis: Stimpson? Applegate (me): He's gone. Hollis: Gone? Applegate: I smashed his helmet. Hollis: ...you? Applegate: He wanted to be saved. I saved him. Hollis: Yes. Applegate: Approved? Hollis: A what? Applegate: Approved?? Hollis: A what? Applegate: Approved!?!?! Hollis: Oh! Approved!  Heh. that cracks me up.  Well yeah, I think that's all I really need to say for now! Oh wait... here's my link to my fiction press stuff. http://www.fictionpress.com/~sokkonn Right now, The Last is really hot. Check it out, got chapters 1-4 up. Nothing else on there really matters... but you can read it anyway. Right!  Yeah, that's all. Merry Christmas! (yes, it is January 7th. so?)

      I've got a freaking plunger around my neck!  Again! yay!   Took a Book Quiz-        You're  Catch-22 !   by Joseph Heller     Incredibly witty and funny, you have a taste for irony in all that you see. It seems that life has put you in perpetually untenable situations, and your sense of humor is all that gets you through them. These experiences have also made you an ardent pacifist, though you present your message with tongue sewn into cheek. You could coin a phrase that replaces the word &quot;paradox&quot; for millions of people.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     intriguing...  Today was fun. I woke up at 11:30, and then didn't eat anything because I was to get a choloesteral check... it was great fun! well, not really. Kinda hurt, but yeah, I'm proud of myself and my recent attitide about dealing with pain. I'm a lot better at it then I used to be... I think I have Rachel to thank for that. mmm, don't ask, please.   Then I went to the Colorado Grill, starving, got a yummy spicy chicken combo... damn, that place is great! Ran into Naomi there, too. After that I went home, played hours of Mario Kart with Dan, Joe, and Dan (my brother)... we unlocked a couple karts. We took em home and went to TRU, got some new action figures... yay! then ate dinner, got on the computer... yeah, that's where I am now. Simple day, really, but fun. Gah, I don't want to do homework. I'm not sure how much I will do.

      Oh man, today was so much fun. It was the eternal day of the DI Competition, and it was really fun! We all met together at my house at around 10:30, and after a frantic morning of trying to get everything and put it all together, we made it to the competition at around 11:50. Our preformance was to be at 12:05. Well, we all came together, and preformed. It was very choppy, yes, but we did it, the dreaded reagionals were over! We knew we didn't have any competition, that we were immediately going to state, which was part of the reasons why we did that event in the first place. Anyway, we did our instant challenge (didn't go that well, but it was fun and we had a good attitude), then went to watch our sibling team, John's team. They had a great preformance, it really was. Then we all got together and went to Fosters, we (myself, anthony, erin, noreen (members of my team), john, lizzi, chip, taylor (john's team), rae (judge), joe, dan (friends who joined us later), gioia, and fran (moms)) ate our food. Then we moved on to the Awords Ceremony.   When we first got there we were kinda just sitting around, wondering why they were only playing music and not announcing the scores yet. Not sure why, but the music wasn't bad. We all talked for a while outside, and moved in and out a couple times. Then we all (by now it was myself, anthony, erin, jennika, john, chip, lizzi, taylor, dan, and joe) found ourselves in a circle... and we danced in a great group, all having a blast. Oh, it was so much fun. We danced to the Chicken dance thing, the Hokey Pokey, nearly all the group-dancing songs you could think of. Ah, it was a blast. We all had fun, too, they were all great people. That group was the hightlight of the day. It was just such a great, big group to sit and/or dance with.   Score came out, we got first place, which was funny because Noreen was the one to announce it... what can we say, she's a great announcer, which is why she's our narrator AND one of the judges for our event. Heh, funny. But yeah, we got our metals. John's team also got first (they were competing against a Freshman team from our school), so we'll both we going to State together... hopefully.  After we parted ways, Joe and Dan stayed with me (as they usually do when we meet for an event). Now they're here, playing on the computers with my brother. Soon enough we'll all play Mario Party 5. Ah, what a good day.   Oh, yeah, changed the name my Blog... not exactly sure why! Guess it's just a quiet, subtle shoutout to homestar runner.

      I wouldn't pay money to see it. Heck, I wouldn't see it for free. Not even if someone gave me one doller. You know I might if someone gave me five bucks. 10? Hmm... more likely. 20? aw, 20 bucks? Sure. Anymore? Oh, of course. Heh, I guess I'm not as Jewish as my dad... "I wouldn't see that movie if they paid me 1000$!" But what about a million?   Speaking of Jewish... Fidler on the Roof auditions are next friday! Heh, that's really exciting. I would love to be Tevya. People say I'm really the only one who could pull it off, and I see where they're coming from. Although I could see Andrew doing it, he'd be okay. Jacob, maybe, he's been getting better. John's taking a philosophy class instead so he's out of the running... but somehow, I just see this happening:  Tevya- CHIP GROSS.  I would hate it if this happened. I really would. Chip is an incredibally talented guy, and I understand why he's gotten so many wonderful roles in the past. But for god's sake, he's thin, he's blond, he's hardcore Christian. Me, I'm not thin, i'm not blond, I have the Jewish curls, i've got Jewish blood. (Trust me, Jewish people do have certain characteristics. The curly hair, the thick- sorry. anyway...)  But yet I could see it happening. They'd give it to Chip because they'd be afraid to give it to anyone else. Maybe Chip can be a Russian. Yeah, a Russian. And Taylor can be the tailor.   I'll have to be understanding if I don't get Tevya. It's a really, really big role... I haven't been the star of a show since... since well, Matress. Of course everyone says I stole Les Mis, bwahha... Kalideoscope wasn't mine, I'm pretty damn sure it was Lizzi's.... yeah yup uh huh, that's all my shows. Since Matress, that'd be great full circle if it happened again. I'll just have to hope.   ah, yes indeedy, things are interesting.

      Don't you fret for your buddy Sambo, folks, he knows what he's doing. (regading last post's problem) Yeah!   So I have an ear infection. No big deal, though. I just have to remember to take a pill 3 times a day. Not that I'm not used to taking that pill... heh, I think this is the 4th time I've needed it! First time was for Bronkitis, second time, a different ear infection... thrid time, i had a sort of Bronkitis again... and then fourth time... another ear infection. I'm beginning to sence a nasty pattern. Aww well, it's never really bad. It's kinda fun, actually, for some odd reason I get a wee thrill out of seeing my name on a pill bottle, of a bottle that I can fully claim! It is MINE! 100%! MIIIINNE! Only I can have it! and I will have it.. ALL OF IT! BWAHAHAAH!... yay for Amoixilin! yeah, I'm a weird one, Mr. Grinch. Aww well.   Ear infection = no big deal. My ear will probably'll be back to normal in a couple o' days. In other news...  Anthony and Erin are back together, FINALLY! (it's been a... week.) When they are apart, the world is anarky. Things are the way they are meant to be with anthony and erin together.  heh, as you can tell, I'm in kind of a good mood. I'm proud of myself because I actually did Statistics homework tonight. Believe it or not, I was actually having a really nasty night before I got a phone call. I was moping, I was in a slump, I was tired of all dis UHS crap! I think it started when I found out I failed the Frankenstein test. I got bummed out... and yelled at my cousin online... I apoligzed quickly afterword, but yeah... I had a rough night. I got a little inspired, and started doing homework. did a little bit of homework, then... ring ring!  Oh, it's 9:10! That's gotta be Rachel calling. (she calls every night just after 9, when she gets unlimited minites on her cell phone... long distance, you know.) I'm always positive it's her, so I usually answer the phone with "Hey!" but tonight, since I was a little bit exaspurated, I answered with "Arrrr!!!!!!!!!" I heard her chuckle. Then my dad answered. "Hello?" "I got it, David. Sorry about that." She started to laugh. I didn't really understand why at first, it was actually kind of odd for Rachel to be laughing so much, but I just started talking. "I'm kind of aggravated, tonights not going well." She then sounded very consirned... "Not going well? What's wrong?" Although she DID sound a little different. She sounded a bit like... Holly! Heh, that's funny. "It's just... you don't sound like yourself. Is that you?" "Uh... yeah it's me." "...Rachel?" She then laughed again. And it was confirmed that that WAS NOT RACHEL. "Oh MAN! It's HOLLY, huh!" "Yes... this is Holly!"   LOL! Oh man, that's SO CLASSIC! Imagine what she would of thought, calling me, hearing me pick up with "ARRRR!" and her she must of instantly though I knew who she was when she called, even though she must have had no way of knowing! That's great! We talked about it later, how funny it was, and I told her what she called for... her grade on the english test. It really pearked me up. Holly and I didn't talk for that long, but it was such a funny mix up... I was so sure it wash her. Simply becuase of it being 9:10. Even though Holly and Rachel sound really nothing alike... ah, such a funny mix up.   Well yeah, that's all tonight, folks. I hope my story made you laugh a little, it really cheered me up.  Have a ball! Have two! Three!

      arg. I have a wee bit of a dilema. Readers, I want your advice on this one. So after you read this, e-mail me or IM me. Sokkonn on AIM, normality_should_be_a_sin on Yahoo, mr_ybnormal@yahoo.com on MSN. That's also my E-Mail, and I've got a new E-mail too... thumbtacks_for_the_zoo@yahoo.com . Heh, I won't check the ladder one as much as mr_ybnormal, but yeah. I may make the transition to thumbtacks eventually. YB's getting crowded. So... the dilema.  I like earning trust a lot. If I can earn the trust of a friend of mine, who previously wouldn't tell me things, I'd be very content. Lately my friend has been confiding in me, and i'm really glad about it. Freshman and Sophomore year, I really wasn't a very trustful person, and I'm trying to change that. So, again, I'm glad this person (we'll call him/her person A) can trust me. But the things Person A have been telling me really aren't that good. They're pretty damn evil, in fact. It makes Person A lie about something involving Person B. Person B is an equally good friend to me, but I don't really care about Person B's trust at much as Person A (gah, that's horrible). I kind of want to talk to Person B about what's going on with Person A... I saw Person A lie to Person B's face flat out. But if I do, Person B might just want to talk to Person A about it... and I'll of lost Person A's trust again. Sure I'll have Person B's trust... but I'm so stupid as to value Person A's trust much more then Person B's. I'm only human, I suppose.  A part of me wants to talk to Person B, he/she is a really good friend to me. But by doing that I'd be betraying Person A... I feel like as Person B's really good friend, I should be able to tell him/her things. But this is something that maybe Person B doesn't need to know. I think it would just bum him/her out. If I told Person B what I knew, they'd want to know. But that would just hurt Person B's friendship with Person A... which probably isn't too great anyway, since Person A's lying to Person B...   gah, I'll probably just end up telling Person B. If Person A finds out, I shouldn't care. I shouldn't care about what Person A tells me, it shouldn't matter to me, but it does. But what you don't know can't hurt you, right? It would just make things worce for Person B if I told him/her. gah, I don't know  It makes a difference if I tell you the situation. But I can't without revealing the identities of Person A and Person B. I think i'll talk about it with people tonight, see what they think.   Uh hey, if you think you're Person A or B, then you're probably not. You're PR, the Paranoid Reader.  PR is not = PA or PB. heh. yeah, math.   I don't know what to do. l'll just follow my conscience, and see what some people think.

      Ah... so glda it's the weekend. Last night I went to dinner with Philip, Christy, Sarah, Kaile, Erin, and Rachael. It was pretty fun. And today I went to the Academic Decathalon SuperQuiz... sadly, University High got 2nd, losing to... of course... Edison. bla. I'm not sure how they do it. I was thinking during the SuperQuiz that maybe they have a very eleborate cheating method? But some of those methods you really couldn't cheat with. Yeah, we didn't beat Edison, but still, 2nd is really good. I mean our school is only 4 years old, and we've only been doing AcaDec for 3 years. The first year was so lame, it really didn't even count. so getting 2nd is really quite good. Heh, I feel sorry for Bullard and Roosevelt... their used to getting 2nd, but nope! not anymore!  And we're back! The name is now Complicatedly Simple, as Kadlideoscope is over. right.  The following is a rant about Christanity. If you suspect it will offend you, please do not read.    Boy, I sure have been thinking a lot about religion as of late. Ever since Chip did his whole schpeel about dead folks... "Was he a Christian? Well, I'll see him in 80 years. Not a Christian? Ooh... I'll morn for him..." yada yada yada. It was really nothing, but it's a real morbid thought when you think about it. Christians believe ALL THOSE PEOPLE are going to hell. Geez! So many people! And let's see, what about all those folks who were around before Jesus? Oh, they all go to hell just because? It's so weird. If you think real hard into Christanity, you find so many things that just don't make sence. Of course I could say the same about every religion. I wish I could have respect for Christianity, but I can't help but want to encourage people to think outside the box. I encourage people to think "What about this..." about their religion. Of course generic Christians won't do that, because they enjoy feeling special. Oh so special. They won't admit it, but they enjoy feeling better then non-christians, the feeling of going some place others will not. People like elites, you know. So they're not going to think outside the box and they're also going to be afraid to do so, because they're probably afraid of going to hell. It's no wonder Christanity is so popular... makes them feel special, and uses fear. Less people are likely to back away if their afraid. Eh, I don't know about religion...

      *sigh of relief* ah, life has returned to it's normal pace. I finally have time to post here. All last week I had a show/a rehearsal, and so I really didn't have time for much of anything. But! The show is over! And things are fine.   The shows went pretty well! I was most happy to finally have people see my show, and to finally have people understand me when I was saying "This is a ______." "A what?" "A ______." And "Well now, hear this! I... Have no left hand. The weakest show was probably the Saturday matinee... Who's used to doing a show at like 2pm? Energies were low. and my voice was scratchy from this cold I'm getting over, so I didn't do that great. But that night was great! I made more errors that night then the day performance... but energies were better! So it was all around a better show.   Yeah... we had our visits to denny's and carrow's after the Friday and Saturday shows, too... those were fun, both times we got our own little room.... oh! what fun! Heh, Saturday Night Christy's puples were two extremly different sizes... has something to do with the crazy headache she had and the medicine she took. Man, it's funny how people deal with pain differently. Some people are completly hit by pain... it illuminates all over them... while others, like Christy, it's hard to tell she's in pain.  My story's up! SIN SEVEN, chapter one! I'm really excited about it! go read read it now! www.fictionpress.com name Sokkonn. For those who read it and want a sneak preview of the next chapter, here it is!   "October 24th, two thousand four. It is raining hard on Virginia Avenue. People say they like the rain because of the smell of it, the feeling, the sound of it all. But I can't smell it. I can't even feel it. All I can do is hear the rain, and without the other two, it isn't much of an experience. 	I want to taste the rain. I want to smell the rain. I want to feel the rain. I want to experience the rain the way I used to be able to. But I can't. I never will be able to fully experience the rain again. Never. " heh. stay around.  Yeah... I should probably start homework soon... good night all!

      I'm so dependant on my friends... I have trouble imagining where I'd be if not for them. Heck, I'm dependant on like a lot of people... only sure of myself and my desicions if I have people cheering me on.   Example: I wouldn't have gone for Thenardier if it wasn't pointed out to me. And the role wouldn't have been HALF as much fun if I didn't get all those reactions from people... like "Sam you're facial expressions are great!" or "Geez Sam, you were scary in that scene!" It's the people that make it all worthwhile, really.  Heck, even the career I want is dependant on people. A therapist is dependant on people. If people don't need help, a shrink is out of a job.   I wonder why I'm typing this. I'm really not in a bad mood, just getting a little tired. Oh well.  I thought of some philosophical words to leave you with: What is a mirror if it has nothing to reflect?

      Ah! I smell... mmm... happiness.   No school tomorrow... Kelly's back to her happy self... I finially was able to watch a new episode of 24!...toe's feeling better...   Ah.   Yeah so on Sunday I busted my toe on the exersize machine. My pinky toe on my right foot. It was really hurting, and pointing in the wrong direction for a while... but it's getting better. Hey, let's check on that. gosh, that bruise is getting long... it's a nice purple color, though. I think it's pointing in the right direction... it's all healing up!  I killed my brothers ankle tonight. He was sitting on the coach, and once I came in there he purposfully extended himself so I wouldn't have room on the coach. Well, I told him I'd jump on him if he didn't move, so I did! And GAH, for about 3 minites he was in agony. Something popped in his right leg. Poor guy. I feel kinda guilty, but I told him I would!   actually I feel pretty guilty about that. heh... it's funny, though.  Maybe I'll upload Chapter 4 of Sin Seven tonight. I want to space em out because it'll take a while to get chapters in from other people. We'll see!

      Hmm. It's 11:16 Tuesday night. I heard a female called at around 10:30, while I was in the restroom. I wonder who it was... apperiently they called back while I was still unavail, and so no one answered (stupid brother).   I wonder who it was. Probably Rachel...? my brother said it was soft spoken, would Danielle call at this hour? Hmm, who knows.   I'll have to ask Danielle tomorrow and I'll call Rachel at lunch. Hopefully everything's okay.  ah, rachel, just   wait   till you see what this present is! I wonder if you'll understand... heh. bah, who knows!  we'll just have to find out on   april 5th   or so.  Peace.  PS- Gah, I have been the king of incomplete/uncomprehencable blog entries... see what's happening right now is big in my head but I don't want to explain it until there's something notable to say. Nothing   really   notable to say as it is... heh. It's all so exciting.  I'm happy. ...geez, i'm more excited about going to Salinas than going to prom. That's insane.

Once April roles around, I'm going to change the title of dis here blog to "Lead Me To Your Door". Isn't that great? heh. Beatles, man. Yeah. They're the best.   Gah, I've got to improve what I think of myself honestly! being a friend to john for so long has really lowered what I think of myself. geez. Yeah, people, don't be a friend to people who you don't benefit from being their friend, really. Acquatinces is all right, but man, those people who take more then they give really suck.   bbbbla!! hmm prospect prospect prospect!  Do I seem high? I'm really not. Then again I am; heck, i'm high on life, yo! that's why I don't need those drugs... yeah man right now this is the best ever and I have full control of it all! Man I wish everyone could feel this right now without drugs or alcohol.   Theremin theremin! I have the kit and Anthony's building it! Man it seems like the world is so excited about me having one. Max is really excited about it, as is Jena, you know I'll bet anyone who I tell that I have one will want to come over. cool. yet another attraction for people to come to my house.  gah life is funny.

      You know this morning I was thinking of creating a new blog, one that is completely uncensored. One that I wouldn't tell anyone the link to, that I could say anything I wanted. Alas, I realized, the point my blog is to get people to read it and having a secret blog would just be like having a journal... on the web. I don't know, be kinda redundant. Besides, the main things I'd say on this super secret blog wouldn't be good. If they're not good thoughts, is there any point in keeping them around? Nah, just let em go.   unfortunately for you, you are my every wish  my mind is an odd place.   woo! 2 months till my half birthday!  I used to get a little cake every month on the 20th, actually. It was never a big one(except on my actual birthday)... a little sarah lee chocolate one... but it was always really nice. I don't know how it stopped, guess it gradually phased out.   you betray me you stab me in the back you wouldn't nearly be as excited as you are if i won  Had a wee EPT test today. It was fine. An essay, and two 45 question sections of english. Bla. Just made me wake up early so I'm all tired now.  Last night was Elizabeth James' party. It was pretty damn fun. At first it was rather dull, but towards the end we ended up playing this improv game... we made a scene and had it turn into an orignal song. Kaile and I did it. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN! We must have done it like six times and every story was different, every song was different, the audience loved watching it, chip loved playing it, kaile and I loved acting it. Heh, really funny stories and stuff, too. We're talking a guy at McDonald's who doesn't know what to order and so he's asking the clerk, and she doesn't eat here because she's a vegietarian, well, this is inconsieveable to our protagonist. So he doesn't know what to get because it's midnight... he finally decides on a chicken combo. He takes one bite and... It's delicious!  and towards the end, he(I) sings... "Maybe I'll see you around..." to the worker. Heh. Another one:  A young man and the girl he has just started going out with are meeting for a picnic on a hill. She makes him his favorite, Peanut Butter and Honey. He takes one bite, and instantly washes his mouth out with milk. He really doesn't like it, but he doesn't let her know. Well he hopes for something else, so he has some ham. But the ham has relish on it because she made it for herself. But then it is revealed! The only reason why he doesn't like the peanut butter and honey is because the honey is organic! And so he realizes this and has another bite... having this in mind... and... He hates it!  THE END!  heh. so funny. so awesome.  We did one on Big Ben, one on Jeopardy, the first one was finding a 20 doller bill on the floor... heh, that one was great... Aw, they were all good!  Checking out

      bla. fiddler cast list was put up. twas everything i expected... no real surprises. chip tevye, emily golde, jennika tsidel, naomi hodel, holly chava, andrew lazer wolf, ryan, taylor, and jay are the three guys... yeah, I got the begger. woot woot. it's like sophomore yaer all over again...   I'm not happy for Chip... he's incredibally used to this situation... same with Emily. Jennika and Naomi deserve some plauditz, kinda good to see em kicking it in high gear... but this should be a senior show. We're the ones leaving. Speaking of a senior, Holly, one of my favorites, got a reasonable part, Chava. I would be happy for her but it's difficult to be happy for someone who isn't happy for themself. Holly wanted Hodel. Only reason she didn't get it is because she's shorter then Naomi. That's kinda screwy. Holly doesn't believe sophomores should get parts over, and while Jennika and Naomi are both good friends to both of us, I kinda agree.  Jennika and I seem to have a counter power over eachother... last time she got a good part (12 angry people) I wasn't in it. Then Les Mis and One Acts she didn't have that good parts. But now she has an amazing part in Fiddler, and I'm... the begger.   People say congrats. "You made it!" gah. I'm sorry, perhaps I'm just egotistical, but of course I fucking made it. Everyone who auditioned made it! I don't WANT congradulations for being the begger. That really bugs me. I want congradulations only when I do something I'm PROUD of.   damn it, I want some waves. I want to go see the waves. I want cold back. I like cold.   something good has to happen. something real good.   So much unhappy in the world. (Don't you dare say anything about grammer... I said that on purpose.) Danielle's doing a little better but she still doesn't want to be here. It's a disturbing view point. And yet eerily thought provoking at the same time... is a life filled with more bad then good really worth living? meh. I'm just a tad on the depressed side, as you can probably tell... I'm easy to read.   the last UHS show and my fondest memory will be from last year. bla.  Watching Les Mis in choir made me happy. why oh why couldn't we do that again...

      Yes sir, I have changed the title of me blog. I like how each month it has a different title, so I'm going to keep it that (ignoring Stragely Simple and Complecadely Simple- which are just variations of the web adress, which will never change) way. I just got off the phone with Danielle, and I feel particually proud words I said... I don't know what it has to do with something optimistic but yeah... I'm kind of overwhelmed right now.   I'm not backing out. So help me I never will. If I can make a difference in someones life- in anyones life- it matters not how it makes me feel. And it shouldn't even bother me, if I am making someone feel better then I have done my job and I am HAPPY that I have done my job. I am proud about who I am.

      So Holly's party went pretty damn well! ag, sorry, we're talking about a Mormon... let's start over.   So Holly's party went really well! Most everyone showed up that I was expecting, except Addison... but apperiently he never shows up to parties that he's invited to. Meh. It was so great. Holly seemed genuinely happy throughout the whole thing... it was different for HER to be blowing out the candles, for HER to be opening the presents... yada yada yada. It was great, I could tell she loved it. It's great to see her so happy... she really appretiated it! ^_^  It started out so funny. People were to show up at 5, but I didn't get there till like 5:20 due to my mom being late... but luckily we got there before Holly arrived. We unloaded everything, and talked about our plan: All the people in senior math classes are going to "study", and we're going to give Holly this fake test i made for her (heh, it's classic!) after answering all the questions reasonably successfully (one of the questions was "Charles is 12 years old. His brother is 4 years younger. How old is Charles?" and she said 8 heh. heh. yeah, well, I would too...  maybe... heh. heh.) and realized finally that all the letters she got right spelled out "H-A-P-P-Y  B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y" and Taylor, Jennika, and Sarah revealed themselves, we all blew into little party horns (whatever they're called) and it was revealed: "It's not a study session, it's a birthday party!"   So we ate pizza (that I bought), ice cream (that I bought), cake (that christy made), chips (that I bought)... talked for a while, played some Scagetorgories and Twister, she opened presents (I got her a pack o' Polar Ice Eclipse Gum, just so ya know... whoever you are, myserious reader), talked more, and watched a little bit of Pirates of the Carribean. Then Dan and I went home after picking up Joe, and now we're just playing on computers. So it went well. I'm very glad.  The people who were there were myself, Christy, Erin, Kaile, Holly (but of course), Taylor, Jennika, Sarah, Jessica, and Dan came by later. I don't think I'm forgetting anyone.   ah, yay for happy holly. yay for happy rachel. yay for happy... uh, people.   "i'm so old school... they tore the school down!"  nay for callbacks. They had me read for the Begger and for Lazer Wolf. I really, really hope for Lazer now. Bla. Whatever nay for school. Hmm. yeah, time for a rant.  I don't konw if I ever got back into the school-swing of things ever since winter break ended. Because it seems like alll semester I've done as little work as possible. I've been trying as hard as I can to get much fun in the night as I can, but it always goes so fast. I have, multaple times, thought that this semester is really summer incognito or whatever. I'm not sure why I'm thinking this. Seniortis, maybe? It  is  my last semester as High School.   I just am kinda bummed out about Fiddler auditions. It felt like I only had the one chance and that was it. So quick, too quick. Les Mis auditions were great, so many chances, so many auditoins... yeah, the cast list was posted like a month after the first auditions, but it was still so nice. The one acts were nice to, because you got to do more then one scene, sometimes the same scene twice... You could really get into the swing of things while you were in there. bla... it's just because Jennika's getting a good part this time. Wheneva Jennika has a good role in a show, I don't. I wasn't in 12 angry people, she had a good part. I had a great role in Les Mis, she didn't. I also had an awesome role in Kalideoscope, and she just had a regular role in (only) This Is A Test. Now she has an awesome role in Fiddler, and I'll probably get the Begger. Lazer Wolf, if I'm lucky.  heh, lazer wolf... kinda like lazer crabs. yeah. You can tell I'm pretty damn tired this evening. hmm. Perhaps it'd be beneficial to work on Proceed With Caution... rated G. heh heh heh I would kill to hear Chip say that in that crazy voice he has.   don't die on me, all of you... i'd fail if you did  G'Night.

      I suppose I should update my blog, since the last thing I put on here was some quiz results. I don't know, I go through phases off and on and my desire to update my Blog changes. So there's a couple things to talk about tonight.  One day in Statistics, Mr. Gile is talking about a certain math problem. He says that when a certain something is a certain way, you need to proceed with caution. Me, Chip, and Erin found this to be halarious! So instead of concentrating on class we created a movie, a rated-G horror film, called "PROCEED... WITH CAUTION!" we all got really inspired! I wrote the script, and now have 9 pages of PWC goodness! It's kinda weekly written, heh, but that's all the fun of it.  I auditioned for Tevye. Wasn't too pleased with my audition, I thought I did better the night before, but I made callbacks, so I have a second chance. That's good... we'll just have to see how those go. Be a hoot if I got the part.   Hmmm... yeah. That's all for tonight.

      Two represents interaction, two-way communication (as opposed to one-way) cooperation, and balance.  You are imaginative, creative, and sweet natured. To save me from having to put each of these in a sentence each, the following describe you; peace, harmony, commitment, loyalty and fairness. But there are two sides to the coin. Twos also introduce the idea of conflict, opposing forces, and the contrasting sides of things; night and day, good and evil, so on and so forth.  You can be withdrawn, moody, self-consious, and indecisive. Please rate my quiz.     urlLink What does your name and arithmacy say about you?

      Hello world. My name is Samuel. How are things today?  ...hmm. felt very formal. using "Samuel" tends to sound very very formal. Of course... people who usually call me Samuel it's pretty cool... Then again that could just be because their intent is neat.   Life is returning back to happy. That is VERY good! I really think I'm back to normal. Everything's fine... dizziness from the boat, mourning about Danielle, worrying about friends... it's all working out. Plus Alex and I are becoming better friends. cool... heh. heh. I have GOT to hang out with that girl next weekend.  Actually I technically should this weekend, but I've got a stats review tomorrow and I'm giving my Sunday to Brittany. I haven't seen her since september sophomore year, it'll be insanely cool to see her again.   Today was ditch day. Today was fun. It started out being annoying though. I was planning for my parent to call me in sick. Well my mom said that it's better to go there and sign on the yellow paper. I thought it'd just be better if I was sick, so I at first hesitated... but I realized the school got money this way, supposedly.   And it didn't work that way. It was useless. Not only THAT, but we got to hear Dr. Huff, who so undenyably HAPPY to see us! ugh... he gave us all this bullcrud about how the seniors next year won't get a grad night... (yeah didn't we pay for that? what's he talking about?) Yeah that's great, tell that to us who came to the school trying to give you some money? Yeah, that's great Dr. Huff... see if you have our support now. Ugh. I swear, it's difficult to get Dr. Huff to stop talking... very very difficult... while he was giving me and my dad that little lecture the phone was for him, so he was holding it there the whole time... geez.  Anyway, after that annoyance I cought up with Linda, Erin, and eventually Chip, to go to Pismo. Well hey! wow! no one knows how to get to Pismo...  and after about 30 minites of trying to figure out what to do, we took off for Shaver Lake!  We got there, and first went to the lake. ah, so nice... so mellow... so quiet. We ate something then came back... (we were sure to ask Erin if she had brought her gas stove everytime... not exactualy sure why, chip started it and I continued it... many times... I'm a weird one =D) to the lake, then got drinks and took off back to fresno. We stopped at Sarah's house to try and figure out what we were doing, so we stopped and talked to her for a while. We ended up all going to Christy's and eating pizza and watching Drop Dead Gorgious (that is a FUNNY MOVIE oh man! it sounds like a chick flick, but oh man, it's so not... it's like... refreshingly and humerously disturbing.)... real good stuff. so yeah, all together it was a real good day.   however, I left my backpack in Chip's car. eep. I'll see him tomorrow for a Statistics study session, so hopefully, hopefully, he'll remember. Let's hope. Hope for me, friends!  Hmm okay. I'm going to go. talk to you all ca-razy cats later!

      Mmm... yeah. I should probably update my blog. This week has probably been the hardest days of my life. For a lot of people, probably... last Saturday was the beginning of WOD and yesterday was the final day. That is very, very good. WOD = Week Of Death. I didn't know 3 of them, but 4 people died this week, and 1 dog. And I heard about each of these from friends, I didn't read about them in newspapers. Odd, no? So much death in one little week... anyway.   I'm doing better. Yesterday was terrible, but it's over. I really want to return to my positive self, and I see myself doing that soon. However, I won't completly be happy until the school year's over... SO MUCH STUFF TO DO. The year will end soon enough, I'm sure.  Grad night was fun. Kill Bill vol. 2 was fantastic.  Love you all!  -Me

      wow. yeah. i'm in shock right now. I'm okay, just kind of in shock. I lost a dear friend today, but... but she would always speak of her death so it's not a complete surprise, I've thought of it several times before, it's just surprising.  i'm being completly honest here... I'm not using any dramatic-ness, kind of unlike me, huh? I was thinking of just being like... today I walk down a black sprial or something like that, but you know what, there's no sence in it. The only reason to talk like that is to get pity, and I don't want pity for myself. Not at all. I want pity for Danielle Butterfield, a girl who only got a taste of life before throwing it away. It's so sad... she was very happy as a child, but the downs in her life... they were so overpowering. she talked about her death on many occations, I thought about it often, but... yeah.   I don't know. I guess I'm still pretty shocked.  and hungry.  bla  -sam

      This weekend was good.  Really quick...  but good.  Friday night I went over to Christy's along with Erin, Holly, Christy, Sarah, and Kaile, to help Erin, Holly, and Christy with their Musicianship project. So they dressed me up as a squirrel (by giving me a fro, pink cheeks, ears, and a little tail... yeah, that's about as squrrel like as you can get!)... actually we all dressed up as squirrels... (except for Holly, who was beautiful Mother Nature) and played around in the park.... Yeah, it was actually pretty fun! So later I went home. Saturday morning I woke up early and went to announce at the DI State Competition. That was a blast. It was so much fun to announce before every team (one of which included my buddy Kelly Fitzsimmions who I haven't seen forever, another which was a group from my school, consisting of really good friends), and everyone seemed to appretiate my announcing. I got lots of praise, and attention (everyloves that)... one guy (who happened to be from the team who got 2nd place, going to World) gave me a quarter for my actions! Heh, that was the greatest.  Really, DI people are great. They were all so energetic, happy, creative, most fun... they were all really cool! I enjoyed watching all the skits, too.  But really, I was most pleased with the standings. Bear River got 3rd, that's the team my friend Kelly's on... yay for them!, Arrora Buero something got 2nd, they were really great, they gave me a quarter and had an awesome skit, and 1st place... heh  UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL!   YES! I'm so happy for them. Lizzi, John, Chip, Taylor... yeah, they're carrying on our legacy and going to world! It's awesome!  Makes so much sence, too... they're problem is all about music, improv, acting... all of which they are GREAT at. It really was a fantastic preformances. I'm so glad they made it.   and I got a class ring... it was 2.50! heh. it's cool. it even has what looks like a phoenix on it... that's the best.  And on Sunday I watched Kill Bill volume 1 (oh geez, that movie is the greatest) and hung out with Dan and Joe, I always watched 24 on a special day! woo!  achoo... ah, scuese me  Yeah, so, twas a fun weekend. And Lauren's going to get Alex to listen to her phone messages... bwahaha...  bwahahaha... -samuel  PS- That name just doesn't feel natural. Seems to formal for me. Aww well, we'll see how it goes...

      Brief summary of your name: Sam   Your first name of Sam creates a serious, thoughtful nature, shrewd, efficient, and business-minded. You are one to make your own decisions, and not be influenced by others. You desire independence and freedom from the authority and interference of others. You are not overly ambitious, preferring instead just to seek stable, settled conditions which are adequate to meet your responsibilities. You like to be your own boss and you capable handle responsibilities for others.  Brief summary of your name: Samuel  The name of Samuel has given you a strong desire for success and all the amenities of affluence. You pursue your undertakings on a grand scale, based on your business acumen and ability to visualize an overall plan. Your enthusiasm, aggressiveness, and salesmanship are often sufficient to bring about fulfillment of your ambitions. However, in the attempt to impress others with the scope of your success, you can over-extend your resources to the point that you have inadequate means to cover your basic expenses. There are times when you would be advised to start in a smaller way, and gradually reach your desired level of success through perseverance, patience, and attention to details. When things are going well, you have a generous, magnanimous nature, ready to offer support and assistance to others.   from http://www.kabalarians.com/cfm/Your.cfm   Yeah... I should be going by Samuel more often.   -notice notice! I applied to Fresno State as "Samuel Frank", not "Sam Frank". Perhaps it is the start of a lil' name change. bwhaha.

      Everything has been so freaking IRONIC lately! I mean every freaking thing. Everything. Every-thing. Everything. Diana said that in Statisitcs I'm either sarchastic or angry. And that's completly true! Because I can tell you which assignment it will be before he has the calculator say the random number. It's ALWAYS the one that's the least complete! ALWAYS! It's AMAZING how it always turns out that way, and how the only time it DOESN'T is when I'm not there!   frustrating.  I had lunch today with Bryan, Chip, Diana, mostly, although Jena, Justin, and Noreen were there I didn't talk to them that much. We hung out with Bryan today because he was visiting. Good times. Tomorrow Diana and I are going to play cards (egyption war, of course) and eat Sandwitches because well... we used to play it all the time, without sandwitches, everytime a sandwitch would appear, we would shout "Sandwitches!" we thought it was really funny because we imagined everyone must of thought we were hungry!  Tomorrow's Tuesday, so it is very appropriate to hang out with Diana that day, after all, we celebrate happy tuesdays. Tuesdays are indeed happy... Zephyr.   Okay so 3 things that happened in my dream came true. 1. The Washington Square test is Thursday. 2. Kelly going to Hollywood- err... LA. Close enough.  3. My good friend Merlinda has a charm braselet with a little cross that hangs off of it... one night I drempt it snapped of and sure enough... it snapped off.  SO WEIRD. Are these all just conincidences? Or am I getting the astounding ability to predict trivial things? Gotta start remembering my dreams better... sadly I can't remember last night's at all...   Another part of my dream Saturday Night started with me, my dad, and my brother, going to Fresno State. We were cutting along this big ol' field, maybe the stadium, I'm not quite sure. Well it was a bunch of crazy concerts! Like each area had their own mini stage and each stage had a different song with different people doing different things. Like the first one was really nice... and a later one was circus people on trapese bars. Weird stuff. Anyway, as we walked along, looking at each one, they started singing together, singing something like  "And when we are together we create a S-E-C-T-O-R, a SECTOR! We are a SECTOR! Welcome to Vintage DAYSSSS!" Apperiently, it was Vintage Days at Fresno State, an annual celebration with a bunch of cool booths and stuff. But it was never like this before. Well, it changed, suddenly it was me and my friend Holly walking around. I'm not quite sure where we were, but I was trying to get to the AmphaTheatre because I was hungry, and apperiently they had a bunch of food there. But Holly acted rebellious and wouldn't go there, and I couldn't find it for some reason. Then suddenly I started walking with Christy, and we suddenly walked inside a classroom, a special class tought for Vintage Days (apperiently there were a lot of these in my dream). We went inside there just randomly, but inside was Dr. Huff, the principal of the school, and uh... Lionel Luthor from Smallville, who was the vice-principal, Mr. Hamilton... although we called him a different name. The little class was called "Cut-Throught" and we entered and Dr. Huff saw us and was surprised to see us, saying "Christy! Sam! You don't belong here!" and it turned out that that class was for people trying to stop smoking! So we quickly left, and walked outside, where it was raining. We joined up with Holly and all walked into this cafeteria place, where we sat down. I saw Holly had a crab sandwitch, and since I was still hungry I asked her where she got it. She pointed to this table, I walked over to it. I found one sandwitch, that looked pretty good... it was a potato-chip-garlic-cod fish sandwitch with crackers inside of it, it sounded good but I didn't want fish... so I moved on to another sandwitch, studied them all, yet couldn't find a good one... then I woke up!  That was an interesting dream indeed.  School started back today. It was very VERY good to see people again. Christy, Merlinda, Holly, Chip, Diana, Bryan... heck, everyone was great to see. Twas a fine day.

      The long and winding road that leads to your door, Will never disappear, I've seen that road before It always leads me here, leads me to your door. The wild and windy night that the rain washed away, Has left a pool of tears crying for the day. Why leave me standing here, let me know the way. Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried, Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried, but Still they lead me back to the long and winding road, You left me standing here a long, long time ago. Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door. Da da, da da -

      That's right, it's a new month, that means I can change the title of my blog! Neat.   Isn't it funny how people often switch roles in other peoples lives? Just when one person is kind of fading away, another comes on in to take their place? Odd how that happens.   If there is a big man(? woman? force?) up there in the clouds, then he(? she? it?) doesn't have specific control over us... but he(? she? it?) does have some degree of control. I just recently came to an understanding of something that a dear friend was experiencing many months ago. It has to be him(? her? it?) who arranged that. Oh, yeah, and the other day I went to Target with my mom. On the way I was thinking, wondering if they may have New Wolverine in the X-Men Classics line. This was one action figure I couldn't find in person, and one I didn't want to order off of EBay because it'd be too expensive that way. I really hadn't given the action figure much thought, I kind of gave up on finding it, until on the way to Target. Well we got there, and there it was! Gah! So crazy how these things work out...   Off to the poodle plantation we go! We shall there have TBILTBCE cake-wedding-rings, eat fresh fruit, make a video tape (you know, THAT video tape), and maybe have a couple Schmegma Moments! Oh, maybe I'll fall in quicksand on the way.  "I must THANK you!"   LOL!  Don't worry if you didn't understand any of that... only one person is supposed to.  Life is hysterical.

      God I hate this. Tonight completly sucks. Today wasn't a good day. well I guess it kind of was..  What i need to do is sleep. I'm so tired I can't think clearly, I can't even extinguish my emotions. I have so much work to do... my english grade is a D, I have to make up that stupid Good Soldier test and instead of studying, I'm here typing on my blog! GAH, I need someone to whip me into shape, honestly!  Where's Rachel? or Kelly? talking to them would be great right now.   If I could turn off my life for a day and let a robot take over, I'd do that right now.   I should eat something, try to wake up, and do my best to do government. I guess.

      So life is short, you probably can't make a difference, and you'll die eventually, right? What's the point of it all, maybe you're thinking? It's all about connections. I think the most important element of living is connections with others. If I had never gotten to know Danielle, she probably would have kill herself sometime earlier than she did. I thought at one point what was the point... but I realized that the things she experienced in those months changed her life. She evolved as a person those months.   In the complicated web that is human nature, connection is important. Sometimes you can be surprised what strong effect you can have on someone.   Life may be short and seem pretty crap-full, but connections to others... the oppertunity to change someone or enlightin someone should never be wasted.   ....man, where did that come from? I guess I was just thinking about it, then wanted to type it up and then BAM... well, that's what drives me, I suppose.   Today I learned two things: -Warioware is a strange, strange game.  -For some reason, most people when looking for a futon, tend to call after nine. I suppose the type of people who look for something like a futon would be people who would stay up late. or...something.  heh, interesting little post I have today.  I'd like some comments based on the philosophy previously. Please, what do you think?

      It's a push pop pop through great fruit flaver, push it down, save some for later!  that weird little jingle popped into my head just a couple minutes ago. huh!  I don't feel very inspired to say too much now, but I'll say some basic stuffs: my mom's in Knoxville, as is the DI team (John, Taylor, Lizzi and Chip). We're managing to have sucessful rehercials with out them (concitering we've lost our Tevye, Yenta and Fyedka). They're great fun! Really tiring- I've gotten more of a workout doing all this crazy dances then I ever got in PE.  I have so many parts now. Dig it: -The Beggar -Yussel -Russian -Motel's Father (!?!) -Bottle Dancer  -Kaile's dance partiner  Of course we could probably combine some of those parts... say that Yussel is Motel's Father... no that won't work. Well we can say that the Begger is Kaile's dance partiner, that she cheated on Lazer Wolf when she was alive (yes, she plays a dead character, FrumaSarah) with The Beggar.   So I've got only 6 lines but I really do get to do a lot of school stuff. Dig it- -BEG like MAD! -Dance as a Russian (oh geez it's so difficult and so strunous!) -Dance in the center of the circle during the wedding (not that great, but makes you look noticed) -Be a Russian (I think I should work on that accent) -Dance with a bottle balenced on my head! (I'm actually better at it than the 4 other guys who are doing it! We practiced with books today, and as slippery and soft as my hair is, the last time we did it it stayed on the whole time! everyone was cheering for me!) -Say a couple lines as Yussel... a very very mysterious character! bwah! secret backstory alert!! -Dance with Kaile... AGAIN, just like Oklahoma! It was classic. He called up like 8 guys and 8 girls and had them all line up according to height. I was the tallest of the guys. The girls did the same, and they matched us up according to who is the same ranking to our height! So they put Kaile with me. Heh, she's taller than I, but it works. After we got matched, we were walking back to our seats with arms around each other, here's what happened:  CHRISTY: You can let go of her, Sam, you're not hitched in real life! KAILE: Well we might as well be considering how often we're matched in the plays! SAM: (laughing like mad)  ah, that was so funny!  Man! Writing this blog cheered me up! It's such a great way to remember good times, gosh!   I really am content about with the way life is right now.   off to dinner I go!

      Cinderella: Mother cannot guide you. Now you're on your own. Only me beside you. Still, you're not alone. No one is alone. Truly. No one is alone. Sometimes people leave you. Halfway through the wood. Others may decieve you. You decide whats good. You decide alone. But no one is alone. LRRH: I wish.. Cinderella: I know. Mother isn't here now Baker: Wrong things, right things Cinderella: Who knows what she'd say? Baker: Who can say what's true? Cinderella: Nothings quite so clear now. Baker: Do things, fight things, Cinderella: Feel you've lost your way? Baker: You decide, but Both: You are not alone Cinderella: Believe me, No one is alone  Baker: No one is alone. Believe me. Cinderella: Truly Both: You move just a finger, Say the slightest word, Somethings bound to linger Be heard Baker: No acts alone. Careful. No one is alone. Both: People make mistakes. Baker: Fathers, Cinderella: Mothers, Both: People make mistakes, Holding to their own, Thinking their alone. Cinderella: Honor their mistakes  Cinderella:  Everybody makes   Baker: Fight for their mistakes  Both: One another's terrible mistakes. Witches can be right, Giants can be good. You decide what's right you decide what's good Cinderella: Just remember: Baker: [Echo] Just remember: Both: Someone is on your side Jack, LRRH: OUR side Baker, Cinderella: Our side-- Someone else is not While we're seeing our side Jack, LRRH: Our side..  Baker, Cinderella: Our side-- All: Maybe we forgot: they are not alone. No one is alone. Cinderella: Hard to see the light now. Baker: Just don't let it go Both: Things will come out right now. We can make it so. Someone is on your side-- [interrupted]  Oh, what an unbelieve show it was! I got so emotionally attached during this song, No One Is Alone... it really reminded me of Danielle, and made me all happy and teary and aww. I love Into The Woods so freaking much. God, it was good. =D   salinas people are lucky. gosh. they can audition for it... for me, it happens to be right during Fresno State classes for me! yay!   awww well, I'll have to convince friends/cousin to try out for it... then I can see them.

      I've got a little theory. I wonder if it's true.   I think I get turned off by a girl when she finds me. Becuase then true feelings get clogged by the thought of going out, and you can't be yourself. Plus... I don't know. I don't think highly of myself. Perhaps it still surprises me when someone else does.   I wonder.  I'd be great if someone could like explain how my mind works for me and what it the truth. I want a Jimmy Crickit, dammit!   Is it possible to learn to love someone?   Perhaps I need some more gusto. perhaps I need judy's phone number. hmmmmff.   Ah... the best lessons are learned in the real world, son!

And why can't I appretiate things for the way they are?   ugh.   ...in other news, I must say this new look for my blog is quite nice. Yes, it's a default, but gosh, it's so... cool...

      Look everybody! I changed the title of the blog and the little description thingy.   I want to talk about the odd dream I had.  I was in Salinas, going somewhere with my brother, Rachel, Julia, I think Kelly was there too. I don't really exactly remember what happened, I remember best of all getting a cherry cappachino, drinking a sip, and standing in a picture with everyone... and then falling back, caused by sleep exaustion. I could hear what everyone was saying, but I just kept my eyes closed and didn't listen. I woke up (not really, in my dream) the next day in a nice room, I think Rachel was there, she told me I had slept just about 24 hours. Yeah... pretty weird dream.  bla bla bla I'm feeling crazy... can not concentrate on senior journal, too excited... yaagg

      Man! man man man! Something is defiently wrong with the Kabalarians!  I am feeling so crazy! I read a detailed description of my birth just a couple minites ago. It's so fasinating! I mean... it's ME, me, I, the one who's typing this right now and thinking about what to type... was born! heh, it sounds kind of ridiculous, but it's fasinating to think... my brother was there when I was born. As a new-born, he called me "his baby" and wanted to watch TV with me... it's really no wonder that we get along so well now.   And my parents, gosh, who knew me the second I opened my eyes for the first time... they've watched me my whole life grow and change... so... intriguing!  And the rest of my family, they've all seen me grow... so... intristing.   I wonder why I'm dwelling so much on this???   One thing I found really intristing: As a baby I smiled a lot. I would just look up in the middle of napping and look up at my mom and smile at her. That is such a Sam-thing to do! and I guess it's a Sam-thing BECAUSE I did it when I was so young.   Yeah. I think I'm really tired... i'm going to bed. good night all!  -Sammy  no, no, no... they called me that so much in the Family Newsletter, never once did they call me Sam, so I was thinking of using it just then, but I just can't... I'm not a Sammy!  -Samuel  there... that's beginning to grow on me... sorf of....  -Sam  Can never go wrong!

      Today I got a letter from myself. Seriously! In 8th grade, we wrote letters to ourselves, to be mailed and recieved in 4 years, in our Senior year of High School. Well naturally time passed and I forgot about it, and, well, it came in the mail today. Here's what it said:   Dear Me,  I hope this letter isn't funny. It probably will be what could I do? Oh, Well.. As you know, my name is Sam Frank. I go to Baird MIddle School but I am going to graduate on Thursday. Hopefully I am going to University High School. I hope you are still there, by the time you get this. You are a senior in High School! Wow! I thought becoming a freshman was exciting! My brother Dan, who must be going to Fresno State in your time, (?) is not even a senior yet!   My dog is Terry, and my cat is Sequoia. Are both of those animals alive still? I sure hope so! Did we get a new pet? You should know. My friensd are Evan Sonke (I probably spelled his name wrong), John Dawson, Max Bennett-Parker, Avram Kosasky (I think I spelled his name wrong too), Jason Sue, Anthony Callaway, and David Levy. A Brief Overview of them all: Evan: A really good friend. In your time, I hope we still are! John: He is going to University, so I probably won't lose thouch with him. If I do, he is a guy who is really into D&D, loves to make riddles (when he is in a certain mood) and is kind of mysterious. 8) Max: By now he'll be in Collage. (!?) He is a friend who is REALLY into music. His web site is www.geocities.com/schlatiff , which (if still up) says a lot about him.  Avram: He will be going to school in San Francisco, hope he visits Fresno some time (sniff). I haven't talked to him in a while. Well, there is always summer! Jason: What a cool guy! He is almost the opposite of me in some ways, yet in other ways we are exactly the same! He is Pessimistic, smart, has to have something to do, and enjoys Drama. Has a good sense of humor. Anthony: We have almost nothing in common, but were Ok friends. Anthony is very dirty. Nuff' Said. David: We have almost everything in common, and were great friends. David is very clean. He is a lot like me. Nuff' Said.  They are not in any order at all.  And now some advice: Never do Drugs! If your friend may try them, and they offer, say NO! If REALLY hope you don't do drugs. Well, I'm pretty smart, and I don't think I will. That's a complement to both of us, you know.  I am odd. I like that about me. I walk up to complete strangers, and ask them if they know Sally. Well, not really, that's just insane, but I do do some pretty weird things. I like that about me, I hope i never lose that trait.  YOU WILL HAVE SEEN X-MEN THE MOVIE! You are soooooo lucky! In fact, you probably own the video! You have also seent he new cartoon,a nd played the fighting game. None of those things are out yet. Will Cyclops ever return to the Comics? I really hope so, and you know!  Final notes: I play the Trombone, the Piano, and sing. I love comics, X-Men and Archie, have a ton of them. I also like Anime, and enjoy playign certain games on the Nintendo 64 liek Super Smash Brothers and Maria Party.. I hope you enjoy this letter and still remember my times. Have a great life! This is from me to me, 4 years ago.    ...holy crud. Heh, sorry little Sam, it was actully pretty funny. I was going nuts when I first saw it. Poor Sequoia died a year or two ago. We put her to sleep, she was old and in a lot of pain. But Terri's doing great. We actually got a new dog for a couple hours, Patches, but returned her... too mouthy, you know. Oh yeah, after we put Sequoia, we got 2 new kitties(or so they were at the time), sisters, named Karma and Carbon. They're great.   It was amazing hearing about who your friends were! I couldn't believe what you wrote about Jason. And Anthony, God, I didn't know we didn't become good buddies till High School. That was a shocker. I'm not sure if I ever hear from Avram again... Evan fades away... John and Max are both awesome... I rarely see David, but the times we do it's like no time has passed. He hasn't changed a bit!  Thanks for the advice... I'll keep that in mind. You don't see me seeking out pot or something crazy, but I'm not as radical as I was, apperiently!   heh... oddity. It's fun to be odd. It's great for reactions, but it kind of hurt your social standings with people, little Sam. I prefer just being happy... I think that's what you meant, too.   Yes! I have seen X-Men the movie! Not to mention X2... ^_^. I did see X-Men Evolution... it was great, but the last season was its last. Uh, yeah, I played the fighting game I guess... It didn't end up being that great...  Oh yeah! Cyclops has been back for a while! But Colossus, Psylocke, and Jean Grey died... crazy stuff, huh?   Well... I still sing! Yeah I love comics... not so much Archie, but I do have a ton of them! I appreitate Anime but don't watch it... and I enjoy playing certain games on the Game Cube, not the Nintendo 64.   I'll edit this later.

      Listening to The Way, I started recollecting Danielle's memorial. I was thinking about her family, how incredibally devistated they were, and I started feeling kind of bad for assuming how they must of felt incorrectly, based on the things Danielle said. I remember there was on girl who said she was her cousin... but they were a lot closer, almost like sisters. You know I don't know why I remembered that, something about it was really nice. There was so much love in the little girls voice.   And how Danielle's younger sister comferted her father... it was so nice. The family was so close to each other, and once they recovered, they all seemed so happy together. It was so nice to see. Sad that it took an event like this to bring a family together, but you know, sometimes that's what the world needs.  heh.  I'm just a sentamental old chap!  Yeah. So I hung out with Brittany and Max. We saw Mean Girls. Really fun! I haden't seen either of those people in like ages, it was great to hang out with them. Mean Girls was a good movie, too! I was surprised, but I really enjoyed myself.   I'm pretty happy. Kinda stressed, but happy. heh.   Good night, all!

        CRAZY ONE. You need crazy partners. You dont mind if he/she takes alc or drugs or smokes he is not allowed to be boring. Open-Minded for everything our partner should spent much time with you. Your partner shall be spontaneous and love danger. It is not that important if she/he is rich or if he/she cuts his nails she/he must follow you .You take the domination over the relationship, you decide most of the times where to go. If the sex is not good (any more)you quit the relationship  For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained. PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!!

      You know what? I'd really like to jump back a year. Wake up tomorrow, and have it be June 28th, 2003, and live this past year all over again. er... not exactly live it, but relive it. Have the mind of myself today and the ability to change events in the past.   I almost wish I didn't want to want that. I should be able to accept my current time and make the most of it, but still, I wish I could go back. Then I think... no, that's not such a good idea. Then you'd have to wait a full year to get anything new! How happy would you be, having Roberts as your English teacher AGAIN!?   I don't think I liked Senior year, in its entireity. Too much shit happened.   I started thinking all this when I found a video of myself, Erin, Anthony, and Max hanging out at Rachel's house. We filmed this video where each of us told a seperate story, about something... I don't know, I couldn't exactly follow it but it was so funny to watch! Watching it after a kind of crappy day, I wanted to just pop into the camera and come back on that day, relive all those fun moments.   Damn, it's hot in here! Oh yeah, I made a family tree... My family tree, actually. It's at sokkonn.tripod.com . Oh, how funny it is!   I'm going to Hunington Lake on Friday for Josh's birthday. That should be fun. And hopefully we're going to Carmel on Saturday when Josh's party is over.  Josh, that's one name that's hard to type. I always type John.   It was funny today. My mom was trying to take this top off of a chili paste jar. (Actually, it was labeled " Chilli Paste  with holy basil leaves", heh!) She was unable to, so she handed it to my dad. well, he was unable to too! So I came on down, feeling particulaly strong and cocky... and I did it! But, I wasn't looking where the jar was aiming, and a bunch of it leaked on the floor! aahhh... my dad says I am "Amazing at impossible tasks, but messes up on trivial ones." heh... later, after the chili paste was cleaned up, I knocked over the trash can. geez! What was wrong with me!?  Heh.  Well I'm now chatting with several people, so I'm taking off!  break it down!

      People who say "lol" in their daily speech disgust me. Using internet exclamation in real life... ugh!  Anyway, I've finally found time to sit down here and update my blog! A lot has happened, I suppose... a lot of parties. The show was quite a success, nearly everyone said it was the best show we had ever done. Which is cool. I also graduated, and registered for my classes, so my futures all set.   Here are the classes I'm taking next term: -English 1 -Communications 5 (Persuation) -Bowling (I might drop it) -University 1 (yeah it's a class about how to do well in college. geez. I might drop that one, too) -Sociology -Drama (Intro to Acting) -Drama (Theatre Today)  So all together it's a real nice load! I'm excited, all right.  Neat year will be cool. In the meantime, I have movies to be in, stories to write, books to read, and friends to see.   That was a Sam update, expect more soon.  woo!

      Tis quite fun getting to know new people, and the play is an ultimate time to do so. This was, all together, a good weekend. Friday evening I went to see Harry Potter, then had dinner with Dan, Christina, Philip, and Anna. We got so much food, it was great. Saturday I had to wake up early to film a chemistry movie, but it ended up being great. Me, Chip, Linda, Daniel, Rachael, and Sam were all a very diverse group (in that we had a Jewish person, an Irish person, a Korean-Egyption person, a vietnamese person, a mexican person, and a black person... woo!), so it worked out well, just as we wanted. I had my arm on fire! woo! heh, Rachael put put a trash can fire... but Daniel, man he takes the cake, he stood under the emergincy shower and got SOAKED. It all went really well.  Later that day I went to Rachael's party, which I enjoyed a lot. Holly was in a great mood, she was going nuts, and that makes everything fun... plus the swimming was really really nice, good people there too... Chip, Naomi, Tara, Hillary, Dan, Rachael, Sarah, Christy, Philip, Christina, Jessica, Erin... twas nice. Afterwords, Holly, Chip, Jessica, Dan, and Erin came over to my house for an hour, which was very cool indeed. We watched some movies I filmed.   Today I woke up and went to school for tech rehercial, that was fun. Afterwords I had dinner with Lizzi and Erin, and now am here.   man! preformances are this week! So... crazy.  Well, I guess it's coming together. Today I had a perfect bottle dance. Just have to work on not looking so tense... but goodness it's hard to not look tence when you're balencing a bottle on your head while doing a dance.   Russian dance is looking good too!  yeah yeah yeah!

      ...did I all ready post this evening? I don't think so. A lot of days have been blurring together since I'm doing the same thing at school every...day... but it's not so bad, after all, it's Fiddler on the Roof. It's typically pretty fun. I don't know it's hard, tiring, puts my ankles through more pain then they've ever gone through... but I guess I'm enjoying it. Yeah, I am! It's sad, since it is my last few days at UnivHigh. I'm very uncapable of change... i'm not actually changing all that much, since I'm living in the same place, and practically going to school at the same place.   I think I'm going to take a Musical Theatre class this summer. Er, I'm going to enroll, that is. CSU Summer Arts. It takes up 2 weeks out of my July, which is a shame, takes away Salinas time... but, I'm not sure I'm doing it yet. It'd be very cool. There's a guy involved (teaching?) the class that was in Hairspray and an Emmy nominee. I'd really like a buddy to take the class with. I told Holly about it, but she's too busy being petrified (as if she's going to be more petrified than myself!), my brother would work too. actually that would work very well, because then he could take me to school, as well.   I've been saying Radioactive Awesome lately. Not sure why. I don't think anyone understands other than myself. aww well.  got my weekend all mapped out, and O, what a fine weekend it shall be. Friday after school, Harry Potter with friends. Saturday morn, filming chemistry safety movie. Saturday evening, Rachael's party. Sunday... something... oh that's right I sold my soul to Mr. Needham, big ol' tech rehercial that day.  which means I can't go to Becca's graduation party! ca-rap!  I can't believe we preform Fiddler next week. Gah, didn't we just start!?   Well I'm signing off now because ice cream sounds loverly. I hope you enjoyed reading this!

      mmm, yeah, hello world! I have returned! It's not that I've been busy, it's that I've had things to do. and no, that doesn't mean busy... busy in my mind has a negative connotation. These have been very happy things. Lots of events, as it is the end of the year and all.   My life is completly engolfed by the power of Fiddler on the Roof! It's so fun. Today the bottle dance went okay (still not there, still petrified about it), and Russian dance is coming together, too.   Today was the awords ceremony. I got a little patch for drama, a drama certificate, and a Science pin for doing Science Olympad. Twas rather fun, actually, lots of friends there.   I often think of posting about certain people, thanking them on this blog. I tried, but I'm not so good at posting it here. I'll have to tell people. Or write it in their yearbook.   woah.

       I am so weird. Holy crap! How the heck do I do this!?!?! It's so true that you have to be happy yourself to attempt to make others happy. Maybe that's why I wanted to become a therapist, or maybe its some crazy thing. I mean... I don't know! Life is kinda dull and there isn't too much to be happy about, but I was just online, doing the only thang, and them bam! happy sam! ...so... weird.       I wonder if it has to do with this iced tea I'm thinking! er... drinking. not thinking. drinking.       Perhaps I should eat more bananas.       "This BOX contains a GOD!?" - this crazy game that Anthony is playing... I think I have a new favorite quote.       Agenda: finish cleaning room. write thank you notes. talk to rachel. kelly too.      I'm going to use this sudden burst of energy and apply it into my room!      heh.      -SBF

       Hello, all. Today was annoying, however, it got better. Naomi's party was real fun! Lots of Karioke singing and 50's goodness. I'm not too sure how good a time Naomi had, however.  Kelly and I are buddies again, and I'm so thankful! So glad!  Pretty tired to write anything more, so I'll just continue All About Me:  FAMILY  Three things you like about your mother: She's understanding it all circumstances. She can be really fun at times. She has no problems driving me around. Three things you like about your father: He's just like me, so any problem I have he'll always identify with. Any problem. I can always count on him for that. He's always there to talk to. He cooks... great, great food. What question felt easier to answer? Father Character or physical traits you inherited from your mother: I have her mouth, over all face, ears, hair color. Three things you dislike about your mother: She can be really curious about stuff. She can be very persistant... of course, what good mother isn't? She really gets on my case when I get a bit lazy. Three things you dislike about your father: The embarrasing things he says around my friends. How groutchy he gets about things. How he often acts like a teenager.

      Heh. I chuckle everytime I see my new blog title. Its just so... Crazy! Anyway.   So the party was great. I spent a lot of time with holly, and that is always delightful. Can't wait to see her at the next party!   Last night was so weird. My mind was going nuts. I was dwelling on terribally depressing things and that's never good. It's funny, I can really put myself in denial of all sorts of stuff. I can't type up a single example, but it takes me a while to come to terms with harsh things. One of my weaknesses, I suppose.   If its something difficult I have a hard time accepting it or forgiving someone, so I try to not think about it. Last night I was thinking hard into one of my most difficult unpleasentries, and it was driving me nuts. So... Yeah.   Time to continue All About Me!

      And I am on my way back to the wonderful worlds of prunedale/salinas. I came back to fresno yesterday to go to a cranium party. that was pretty fun. It was me and Taylor against Erin and Tim. The first game, it took taylor and I SO MANY TURNS to progress that we were going nuts. Needless to say, they slughtered us. But then we played again and we won! Although... It was very, very close.   Too close!   So then erin took me home because she had to go to her astromomy class and we went our seperate ways. But we thought that it would be fun to regroup after erin's class, so we did.   We picked up Tim and some movies from Erins houise, and than taylor and moti came, and dan and joe did too. We watched series 7. It was so great. That's one of the best movies..... Ever...   What's great about it is that no ones heard of it or seen it... So its a total surprise to everyone who watches it.   Dan and joe ended yp sleeping over, they helped me and my mom bring stuff out to the car for our trip.   The visit was great. I was so happy to see all of those people.   Yay!   Signing off,  -crazy sa sa sa sam

      Okay so my name means "God has heard" and not "God is heard"... And Benjamin means "son of the south" or "son of the right hand". So... My name is God has heard the son of the right hand. Heh... That's... Lovely.  I'm at the carmel house with lots of family. Grandpa is always really interesting to listen to, so I'm doing that now.  Just checking in!

      Ah! I figured out how to post from my nifty new t-mobile sidekick. It's got aim (cheeze square), a phone (3477527), e-mail (sokon@tmail.com ... Somebody email me please!), address book, tasks, all sorts of great stuff that will make college better come next semester.   Anyway, I've been spending the month in carmel/prunedale. Its been pretty nice so far. Summer has given me time to learn things aboot myself, and I think I'm in the progress of finally doing something I've been trying to do for a very long time.  I like what my name means. Let me find out what benjamin means and I'll put them together for you.  Right now I'm in the car with jesse julia and audrey, on my way to the carmel home because we're all eating there tonight. I'm staying there tonight, which means alias for me!  You know human beings don't really have powers... But everyone has their own abilities that differentiate them from others. Hate to sound so... Corney... But everyone has something special aboot them. Damn you, rachel, getting me to say aboot...  So yeah, this month has been going good... Dan and joe visited carmel, last weekend my dad had doug come visit too, so it hasn't been very boring at all.  Happyland is still one of the greatest places ever.  Oh yeah, and there's an afvantage to being a goody goody- when you do something very small yet slightly diabolical... Damn it feels good!  Hah! If only you all knew what I was talking aboot... Bwahahhhahaha...hahahahahahahahaha!  Okay, enough of that... It seriously is no big deal. Well we just arived at carmel, so I'm going to sign off.  Yours, -God is heard (samuel)

      I just realized I forgot a lot of stuff happened. Well, not really, but I haven't posted what I've been doing, and thus, I will forget them!  Last Wednesday I went to San Fransisco with Holly, Linda, Erin, Lizzi, Dan, John A, and Linda's mom. Fun. Mills was beautiful, and Pier 39 was great.  Thursday was Holly's graduation party, which I and Jennika held, magnificently, if I do say so myself. It was a great occasion. Holly was so happy, and John played a marvelous Dr. Huff.  Friday was a Big Mistake meeting. "You take that off, you!" Heh!  hmmm yeah... today I saw Spider-Man 2 (GREAT ENDING!!!) and went to a dinner thing with Erin. Tomorrow I'm not doing much, but Friday I'm going to Hunnington and seeing Farrenheight 9/11 (can't wait!). And Saturday, my group and I leave for Carmel!  woo!  I'm too tired to post anything more.  oh yeah, visit the family tree!  sokkonn.tripod.com

      Man, linked screen names on AIM are the best! I'm now on four screen names at once. I'll explain the origon of each one, and what they do. My names are: Cheeze Square, Sokkonn, Banana Divison, and Mattress Covers.  Cheeze Square: This is my always-online-except-when-t-mobile-is-annoying name. It's my T-Mobile sidekick name and you can (hypothetically) always contact me on it. It's my main screen name, yo. It's a Statistics joke (there are many of those). We did something called Chisquare, and I thought it looked like cheeze square, and that cracked me up.  Sokkonn: ah, what a classic name! This one was the original, the one most people know me as. If i'm on this, it means I'm on a real computer. Origin: SECRET. only one person knows... I think.  Banana Division: New name! Linked to Sokkonn. I was playing Cranium Hoopla with Dan and Joe(great game by the way) and Dan was trying to act out banana split. I got what he was saying, he did a good job, but even before saying "banana split" I said "Banana division!" and that cracked me up.  Mattress Covers: My cousin and I created a list of screen names that are just simple terms and words we use in everyday talk. We made a list of about 110 hopeful screen names to get. Most of them were taken. However, Mattress Covers was not! We celebrated, and I made it my own! I'm hoping that someday, a big amazing mattress company will want to buy this sn from me. heh... heh... heh...  Imagine having a job of making screen names, and then having people buy them from you. What a job.  allrighteo, signing off!  -cheeze square -sokkonn -banana division (that's really fun to type. try it. now. go. geez. punk.) -mattress covers

      urrg. mmf. I have always hated being blamed for someting I didn't do, or something I didn't know I did. Always. When I was really young me and a friend, possibally Evan, were covering over the dumpster with (ironically enough) spray paint to cover up the swear words that graffiti artists put up. Well, our neighbor (who happens to be the wife of the dude who runs ths school board) saw this and thought that WE were graffiti artists, and asked us where we lived and what our names were. I was stumped, I wasn't sure how to react at all. So I just cried and cried. My mom and I later came to that neighbor and told her what was really going on.  That was the first time I came into that scenario. I wasn't sure how to react to it. I later learned that it's mostly anger I react with. It happened again years later in Salinas with my cousin, and getting picked up in a busy street surprised to see my uncle/aunt (can't really remember) and something like that. Perhaps I blocked it from my memory. I recall them being upset at us for not looking left or right on that busy street. humm. I'll have to see if Julia remembers.  Nope, she doesn't. Aww well.  This current predicament bugs the hell out of me. And what the heck happened to Kelly?  -an especially dependant, confused, frustrated sambo

      yaarrrgg. mmmfff. pptt. I'm a moron. Somebody swing on over here a boost my self-esteem. Thank God I'm having dinner tomorrow with Diana and Merlinda... they will be so great to talk to, and to see.  My room's coming along. I'm cleaning it, you understand. Put a bunch of memorable stuff inside a ziplock bag labeled "Memory Lane". So months(years? weeks?) I'll find it and feel all nustalgic.  I put up a photo gallery up in my room. Got a bunch of pictures of people, places, things. I'm particually proud of it.  mmm.  happy birthday! -Sam
