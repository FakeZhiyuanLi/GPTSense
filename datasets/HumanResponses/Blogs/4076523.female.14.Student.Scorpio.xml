       So, here begins the first sentence of the first entry of my brand-spanking new blog.  Despite this, it won't be anything that anybody wants to read, so cover the eyes of your children.  How should I begin?&nbsp; I'm wondering - Should I simply account of the [un]events of my life, or should I type of things that nobody cares about like the weather, music, television, art et cetera?&nbsp; Oh wait.&nbsp; I got that the wrong way around.  I have decided to not fill in my actual profile on this site, because there is not enough space in it to say all that I wish to say..&nbsp; Never thought that my mouth was just as big in cyberspace.  I have several interests, and yet I am not what you would call an interesting person. My interests include music, art [poetry, drawing, painting, anime photography et cerera], reading, comicbooks amongst others.  Three words that perfectly describe myself: Withdrawn, analytical, leisurely. Sometimes, my withdrawel may seem of my own choice, but I am mostly prisoner to it. I'm the type to enjoy a beautiful sunset from behind a pane of glass. A shame, for sure. I am analytical in the sense that I disect everything that my mind can reach. I am constantly trying to work out people, and why and how they do the things they do. This is one of my many faults that I can't fix. I am leisurely, simply put. An image that fits my personality is that of a cat laying in a patch of sunlight on a kitchen floor. I am, basically, a vegetable of my own kind.  I have a fondness of what I would call "Mind-Fuck-Movies". I like something that is confusing and hard to contemplate, and even outragous. It is what get's me thinking.  On other topics..&nbsp; Today started, hell, just like any other day, week, month, or even year.&nbsp; Patricia woke me up at 10am to announce that we were going to the doctors' [I for my eyesight, she for her mystery stomach illness].&nbsp; Of course, I ended up not going.&nbsp; I hadn't slept for the last two nights, so I found myself ignoring her and rolling over to fall asleep.&nbsp; As soon as she had left, I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt.&nbsp; It was a really bad feeling.&nbsp; I have been expecting the worse of her illness.&nbsp; I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be the death of her, however grim this may sound.&nbsp; I later woke at approximately 4pm.&nbsp; Tricia had returned, with the neutral news that she would have to have more health examinations.&nbsp; I then forced myself to roll out of bed to play some video games and to contemplate the exact moment where my life as I knew it collapsed.&nbsp; Needless to say, I still don't know.  So, here I now am, prepared to kiss the six remaining hours of this night goodbye.  Let's hope tomorrow is brighter, or at least has a pulse.
