      I just had a really long conversation with Becky and I finally told her how I feel about the way she treats me. I was always afraid to stand up to her, but now that school's over, I finally feel like I can because I don't have to face her. Anyway, I don't really feel like getting into the whole conversation, but at first she was being really defensive and kind of blowing off everything I said with a "Haha" or "Whatever" but I kept trying to get her to explain things to me. Her big argument is that no one calls her and everyone from school dropped her and we act like she doesn't exist. The reason no one calls her or anything is because everyone is so fed up with her attitude. She's like a time bomb. One second she's your best friend and the next second she is pissed off at the world. And she had the nerve to tell me that I think the world revolves around me! She just wants to blame everyone else for everything because she doesn't want to accept the fact that she's wrong. I really don't want to deal with her drama anymore. It makes me sick. In a way I want to be her friend and I want everything to work out, but on the other hand, I don't think I would be upset at all if I never saw her again. All she does is stress me out. I don't understand her and now I don't even think I want to. I give up.

      Well, I talked to Deanna last night and everything is ok now. I'm relieved because she admitted that she was wrong and that she doesn't always treat me right. I'm just glad that everything is settled. It always stresses me out so much when me and her fight. Anyway, my Dad and Margo went to Atlantic City. They won't be back until tomorrow. I hate staying home alone overnight, so I think I'm gonna try to stay at someone's house. I used to love being home alone, but ever since my Mom died, it just scares me. I don't know why. Well, I'm gonna go. I'm too tired to type. I may go back to bed.

      Well, the title says it. Deanna strikes again! I'm so mad at her. We were supposed to go to Maria's party together on Saturday because neither of us wanted to go alone because we wouldn't really know anyone. I asked her over and over if she was definitely going because I know her and I know she always ditches me when it comes to these things. She kept saying that she really wanted to go, so I believed her. I had two other parties before Maria's on Saturday, so Deanna didn't have to be ready to go until like 4:00. So I called her around 11:30, when I was on my way to Nicole's party and her Mom said she was still sleeping. She woke her up and asked her if she was still going to the party with me and she said she forgot about it. I figured she would still go because she still had over three hours till the party. So I called her after Nicole's party, around 2:00 and her Mom said she was laying down because she didn't feel good. Deanna never feels good when she's supposed to go to a party. Anyway, her Mom said she would have her call me. I went to Aimee's party and Deanna never called. I left the party around 3:30, ready to go to Deanna's house to pick her up, and I called her again and her Mom said she just walked in the door and Deanna wasn't home and she didn't know where she went. And that's the last I heard from them. Deanna always does this. I don't know why I put up with it. I guess we've just been best friends for so long that I'm scared of losing her. I'm scared of not having a best friend. I know she's not gonna call me. I'm gonna have to call her or else we'll probably never talk again. But I really don't wanna call her because I'm mad at her. She should call me and apologize. Just like last time, I'm not mad at her for not going to the party with me...I'm mad at her for not even calling me to tell me what was going on. I told her over and over that I wasn't gonna go to Maria's party if she didn't go with me and I went out and bought her a present and everything and I didn't even get to give it to her. Anyway, I have to go do laundry. I'm pissed.

      I'm so freaking tired! I thought about not going to Church today, but I've never skipped Church for something like this. The only time I ever miss it is if I have to be somewhere else. I know that will probably make me sound like a dork, but guess what...I don't care! I'm a Christian and I'm proud of it! I like going to Church. Anyway, I'm going to Kobbie's surprise party after Church today. There are too many parties! It stresses me out. I like a new boy. I don't know why I like him, but I do. I'm not going to say who it is, just incase someone I know reads this. But it was really weird because I was trying not to like him because he had a girlfriend who he's been with for like a million years and everyone says they're going to get married and I didn't want to interfere with that. But the other day, Kristin told me that they broke up! I can't believe it! Anyway, I'm excited because I get to see him today and I told Noelle that I like him, so she's going to see what she can do about it. I'm sure nothing will happen, but I'll probably regret it if I don't try. When I told Noelle about it yesterday, it made me really happy because she said he would be perfect for me. Hehe! Like every girl in the world (or at least our school) likes him. I feel like I would never even have a chance with him, but you never know. I gotta go get ready. See ya!

      I'm so disappointed! I was planning on laying out in the sun today, but it's yucky out. I hope it doesn't rain because Dan's surprise party is today. I'm so happy...Katie just told me that Evan is coming and he's bringing Joanne! I really want him to like her because he's struggling with his sexuality. He really needs to get back on track with God before he gets involved in any relationship, but at least Joanne is a girl and she'll keep him away from Sean. Sean is Evan's boyfriend. Well, not anymore. About a week ago, Joanne called Evan and told him that she's in love with him and Sean found out and broke up with Evan because of it. The next day he said he didn't mean any of it, but Evan said it's over and he doesn't want to get back together with him. I'm proud of Evan for doing the right thing. I think he should go for Joanne. She's really pretty and really nice. Even if she's not the best girl for him...She's a girl. Anyway, I can't wait to see Evan today! I miss him so much. I haven't seen him since graduation. I have nothing to wear to the party today. I think I wanna go shopping. I don't know. I'll see what happens. I'm gonna go eat breakfast now. See ya sucker!

      I just got home from Katie's house. I'm exhausted! So much has happened in the past two days. Well, I went to Katie's on Tuesday night and slept over. We went to Hurricane Harbor on Wednesday morning and I got pretty bad sunburn. We both did. But I had a lot of fun. That was the first time I ever went to Hurricane Harbor. The lines were kinda long and it was pretty cold out, but it was still fun. Anyway, after we left Hurricane Harbor, we went back to Katie's and took showers and then we went out to eat at our favorite diner. We got steaks. It was really expensive. As we were coming out of the diner, my cell phone rang and it was this weird woman who I got a prank call from about a month ago. She was saying her name was "Jeanette Farrentino" and she lives in East Orange and she works at a medical group. At first I thought it was a wrong number because she said she was looking for "Vivian" but then she started asking me weird questions, so I knew it was a joke. She was acting like she didn't know who I was, but after like ten minutes, she said my last name and where I'm going to college next year, and then she hung up on me. That really freaked me out. I thought it was my best friend, Deanna, but I called her from Katie's phone while I was talking to "Jeanette" and she picked up, so I knew it couldn't have been her. Later on, she called me again and said that I'll find out who she is soon. All the other times she called, she blocked her number, but this time she forgot to. So we told Katie's uncle about it and he called her from a different phone and acted like he had the wrong number. She answered the phone in the same weird accent that she was talking to me in and he was trying to get her to say her name, but she wouldn't. Then he tried looking the phone number up online, but it kept saying that it was unlisted or something. So then he told us he has a friend in the FBI, and he called him, but there was no answer. Then we went back to Katie's house. We were up really late because Katie's brother got back from his trip to Belize in the middle of the night and we went with their Dad to pick him up from the school. Since it was like 3:00 in the morning, I figured this girl's phone would be off, so I called it to see what the answering machine said. The answering machine came on and it was the same person, with the same accent, using the same name! We couldn't believe it. I was really starting to get freaked out. I couldn't think of anyone who would do that to me. Anyway, today we went to Six Flags and Katie's uncle called and he said he got in touch with his FBI friend and they found out who it was. It was this girl, Candace, who is Deanna's friend, who I barely even know. I have no clue why she would prank call me like that. And she didn't even say anything to Deanna about it. Very strange. Anyway, tomorrow they're throwing a surprise graduation party for Dan and their cousin, Danny. Katie has to bring them to the movies to distract them, so I'm going over early to greet everyone. It should be fun. I hope Izzy and his Mom will be there. I also hope Evan will be there. But I know he won't. I talked to him last night and I said I don't think I'll ever see him again because he's always so busy and he has no time for me and he almost started crying. I hope I get to see him soon. I miss him and I'm very worried about him. Ok, I think I'm gonna go lay down for a while. I need to relax.

      That's right! I feel much better now. Since my last entry, I took a shower and slept for a little while. I'm not sure if we're going out to eat tonight. I hope so. I'm bored. Katie hasn't called me yet. She better! She said she would. Deanna hasn't called me either. She didn't come to my graduation party on Saturday and she never called to say why. I know exactly why. She went to Candace's party on Friday night and got drunk. Oh well. She's only hurting herself. She's probably not calling because she thinks I'm mad at her. I'm only mad that she didn't call, not that she didn't come. Well, I have nothing more to say at the moment. I'm gonna go straighten my hair. Adios!

      Yeah, I just took medicine for my back and it made me very dizzy. I feel like relaxing today. I've been so busy lately. I think me and Katie are going to Hurricane Harbor tomorrow. In that case, I may have to sleep over her house tonight. That's ok, as long as I can go over later. I think me, My Dad and Margo are going out to dinner tonight for Father's Day. Margo said we shouldn't go on Father's Day because every restaurant would be really crowded. Ok, I'm gonna go lay down. I'm really dizzy and tired.

      Well, Deanna is no longer going to Disney World with me. I just found out about this about an hour ago. We're leaving tomorrow night. I never thought I would say this, but I hate her. God, forgove me, but I hate her. How can she do this to me? I don't think anyone else is even going to be able to take her place. It's going to cost hundreds of dollars more to change the name on the airline ticket and the cruise line people said there are penalties involved, but we don't know what they are yet. I asked Noelle if she could come with me, but she's not home right now, so she's going to ask her mother when she gets home. I hope everything works out, because if it doesn't, I will lose about one thousand dollars. I paid for Deanna to come on this trip with me. She always does things like this. I can't take it anymore. And she didn't even have the nerve to call me herself. She had her mother call me and tell me she can't go. I can't believe her mother didn't even offer to give me any&nbsp;money! That's one thousand dollars down the freaking&nbsp;drain! Deanna really sucks. She's so lazy and selfish.&nbsp;I'm so disappointed in her. She screws up everything. She's going to be such a failure in life. She never&nbsp;puts effort into anything.&nbsp;Oh, I'm sorry, she does put effort into getting drunk and getting high and skipping school and getting in trouble and being rude to people and being lazy and disrespecting her mother and being careless and being forgetful and getting involved with guys who beat her up and cutting herself and wasting all her money on drugs and cigarettes and ditching people&nbsp;and letting her friends down. Yup, that's Deanna, my best friend. So much for all the time and effort I've put into our friendship. She could care less about me. I don't know why I keep trying to convince myself that she really likes me and wants to be&nbsp;my friend. She puts no effort what so ever into our relationship. And then she cries when I talk about going to college in Virginia. She says she's going to miss me so much. Yeah right! If she really cared about me, she wouldn't treat me like shit. I&nbsp;regret&nbsp;everything I have ever done for her. I feel like she doesn't appreciate any of it. How can she do this to me? I hate her so much. I can't help it. I really hate her. I know that's a sin and I'm so sorry for feeling this way, but it's how I feel and I&nbsp;just can't help it. Deanna is nothing but a loser. She can't do anything right. I'm sick of putting up with her. I need to let go and realize that maybe this friendship just wasn't meant to be. I've been friends with her for so long that I guess I'm just scared of losing her. But I think it's time to let go. I need to move on. I have so many friends that treat me so much better than she does, but I still call her my best friend. I'm&nbsp;in denial. She is not a best friend. She's far from it. I need to accept that. I'm not going to call her or anything. I know she probably won't try to contact me. She never does. Especially now that something so huge happened. I'm going to leave for college in less than a month and if I don't talk to her by then, oh well. It's her loss. I have given her so much. It was all for nothing. She's a loser. If she keeps living her life the way she is now, she isn't going to have a life at all. She's going to be a bum on the street or she's going to die. She has no sense.&nbsp;I care about her so much that I wind up being hurt by the&nbsp;stupid mistakes that she makes. I need to get myself out of this before something really bad happens. I shouldn't have to deal with her problems. This is going to be very hard because I really do love her and I'll miss her so much, but it's what&nbsp;needs to be done. She just doesn't feel the same way about me. She doesn't really take friendships seriously. Five years down the drain. We have been best friends for five years. What a waste. I feel so stupid. I feel small and helpless.&nbsp;I don't know what I'm going to do now. I really hope Noelle can go on the trip with me. It&nbsp;all depends on whether or not we can pay the extra money. I'm pretty&nbsp;sure Noelle's mother will let her come with us. I really don't want to go without a friend. It'll be so freaking boring! My dad and Margo will have&nbsp;each other, Pat and Laura&nbsp;will have each other, and Kylie and Erin will have each other. And I'll be all alone. I know I won't&nbsp;have a good time. It'll suck. Mary better give me the&nbsp;extra money if I need it. It's my money. Anyway, I'm going to go rest for a while. Maybe I'll take a shower to help me relax. I'm a mess. I cried so hard when I was on the phone with Deanna's mother and she didn't even seem to have any sympathy for me. She&nbsp;just kept telling me&nbsp;it's Deanna's fault, not her's. I'm so angry&nbsp;right now. I can't believe this is happening. I never thought it would come down to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I have never been this busy in my life! I'm the kind of person who spends my summers laying around, doing nothing. I usually just stay at home and relax, by myself. But I have been so busy lately. I'm hardly ever home. I'm at someone else's house each day. Tuesday I was at Maria's, Wednesday I was at Katie's, Thursday I was at Noelle's and today I'm going to Nicole's. And tomorrow I'm going to Evan's play. And Sunday I'm going to Allie and Joe's. I'm not really complaining, it's just very out of character for me to be so busy. Anyway, I have a funny story. Noelle told me that right after Becky called me the other night and I told her I couldn't hang out because I was gonna be hanging out with Noelle, she called Noelle and asked if she could hang out. I can't believe her! I had a feeling she was going to do that. She is really on a mission to get me and Noelle not to be friends. It's sick. Nicole wants to go to Six Flags today. I don't really feel like it. It's gonna be very crowded. I really feel like going to a water park, but no one ever wants to go with me because it's too expensive. That's true, but I really want to go. The only person who can ever go is Katie because she has a season pass to Hurricane Harbor, but she's always really busy. There is a carnival coming up soon. I'm excited. I'm gonna go with Noelle. I leave for Disney World in less than two weeks! I'm so excited! I can't wait! Well, I have to go get ready. Nicole is gonna call me soon.

      There is so much going on right now. I'm very confused about everything. Well, I'm going over Noelle's house today. I'm really happy about that because I haven't seen her in a while. Her dad finally got out of the hospital yesterday. He feels much better. He's probably going to have to get chemo, but it's the kind that won't make him sick. The funniest thing happened last night! When me and Becky got in a fight the other day, the main reason she was mad was because me and Noelle are good friends and she's jealous. Well, last night Becky called me when I was with Katie and she asked me if I wanted to go to the beach with her today and I was like, "Ummm, Sorry, I can't do anything tomorrow, I'm doing something with...Noelle" It was so awkward! I was going to lie and say I was busy with someone else, but then I realized that there is no reason for me to lie. If Becky is jealous, that's her problem. I'm not doing anything wrong. It was really weird though. I just felt like hanging up on her instead of saying that I was going to be doing something with Noelle. Anyway, I looked at Deanna's profile before and she wrote something about "John" and I have no idea who he is. I need to call her today and find out. I slept over Maria's house the other night. I haven't seen her in like two years. It was pretty fun. It was a little awkward at times, but not too much. I missed her. I hope she had a good time. I'm really excited because she gave me a copy of her prom video. I watched it with Katie and it was so weird to see all these people from my old school who I haven't seen in so long. It actually made me kind of sick. I saw a lot of people who I didn't get along with. Oh well. I have to go get ready to go to Noelle's house. See ya!

      Today I'm going to Bunny's house for her Fourth of July party. She's having it early because she doesn't want to have it on a Sunday. My dad and Margo are coming with me. That surprises me. I didn't think they would want to come. I'm glad they are though. Noelle text messaged me today and told me that her dad is in the hospital because he's having problems with his prostate cancer. I never even knew he had prostate cancer! He's been there since last night. I hope everything turns out alright. Right now they're like flushing out his system to try and stop the bleeding. It sounds serious. Anyway, Vacation Bible School is over. I had a lot of fun. The boys in my group were a little much, but overall I had a really good time. It was cool to see the kids grow in Christ throughout the week. Well, I have to go now. Off to the party!
