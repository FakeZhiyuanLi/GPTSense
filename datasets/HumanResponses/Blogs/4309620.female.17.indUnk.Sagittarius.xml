        Tim bought the tickets for Lousiana last night. We're going on September 10th. Timmy is so cute tho our plane leaves at 6am! HAHA. I have to get up at like 1 or 2am and be at the airport by 4am. haha.. i'm so excited. I'm nervous tho first because i've never been on a plane before. Second because we have a layover and i'm afarid our luggage will get lost like Tim's did when he came here. The third because i'm meeting everyone. I'm nervous to meet his parents. I don't mind to much about his friends. He says they'll like me and i've talked to a bunch of them on the phone so i'm sure it'll be ok, they've even said they wanted to meet me. But i'm just nervous to meet his parents...like what do I say to them...? Ah.. i'm scared they wont like me........but overall i'm excitied..! hehe..... g2g something wrong with max he's limping.....:( laterrr  punks
