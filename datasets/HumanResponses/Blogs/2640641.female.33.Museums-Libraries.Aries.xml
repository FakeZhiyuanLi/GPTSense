      Investigating it now.  Will eventually put together a "real" web site.  Till then, stay tuned here.  FYI though, if the URL is easier to remember, you can hit this site at  urlLink sooz.net  now, rather than  urlLink libary.blogspot.com .

      I will now stop writing about water because the hell that was last week is over.  We have a new hot water heater, we managed to unfreeeze our pipes yet again before they burst, and all is finally well on that front. Knock on wood.  As I finally took a hot shower, I felt like the gal on the Herbal Essences shampoo commercial.  It felt so good.  On the school front, after a year and a half of taking classes, I finally found an area of business that I think I like:  marketing.  Not telemarketing.  I think it's the psychology and user-centeredness of it that I like.  It remains to be seen however if I still like it at the end of the semester.  Marketing fills me with the desire to make America love one product.  Perhaps it's possible to do so.  I went and saw a couple of very nice exhibits at the Met this weekend:  urlLink Chuck Close  and the  urlLink Hudson River School .  Traveling across the U.S. gave me an appreciation for landscape painting.  I was enthralled when I first noticed that if I go someplace with wide open spaces (not New England), it is possible to see the weather approaching and see the lights and shadows on the landscape.  I recommend both exhibits.

      So I spent most of the day waiting for the guy from the gas company to fix my hot water heater.  After several days of having to go down to the basement to re-light the pilot light, it would re-light no more.  It's fixed now, but I feel pretty unclean.  I think I last washed my hair on Tuesday, but maybe not even then.  I think I'll take a hot shower tonight when I get home from my Marketing class.  Last night I went to my first ever Economics class.  He gave us a whirlwind description of micro and macroeconomics.  It is okay so far, but very foreign to me.  Perhaps when I finish this degree I will take some cooking or art or language or music classes.  These would feel much more natural and homey to me right now.

      I went to a great workshop the other day on  urlLink Plagiarism .  It was fascinating to hear what cheap ways students were trying to pull the wool over the eyes of their professors in this wired day and age that is filled with  urlLink plagiarism detection tools .  Plus, students tend to discount the common sense of their professors.    Note to students: When professors read the papers, they can often easily tell when plagiarism has occurred.  It's only luck when you get away with it.  Don't be stupid.  Cite your sources.  Ask me how.  Librarians will gladly help with that sort of stuff.  And for heaven's sake, if you're going to plagiarize, don't put the source you copied from in your bibliography.  Are you insane?  Note to professors:  Plagiarism happens.  Be aware of the tools that students use to plagiarize, the  urlLink term paper mills , and the ways you can help to combat it before it begins.  Tell your students what types of sources (books, articles, no more than # of Web sites) to use and what citation styles.  Show them examples of well-written and poorly-written papers.  Let them know that you care about how their papers are constructed and tell them what you expect.  Then they'll know how to do it right without just copying from others.  And do put it in the syllabus that plagiarism is grounds for failure.  When they see it in writing, and you tell them verbally that they will be failed for the paper or the class, you'd be surprised how many more students will listen.  It got me thinking, and I'll get off my soapbox now.

      So this weekend was about unfreezing frozen H20 pipes.  Sounds fascinating, right?  Any of you who've ever tried this at home know that as long as the pipes are frozen, you're not going too far from home.  So I waited, and I hung out at home and did stuff, and snuck out for a bit and ran back home to re-check the pipes, and I waited.  24 Hours later, Sunday night, the water finally started running again.  All thanks to a portable space heater (belonging to an old roommate of mine) that I used to heat up the crawl space under my downstairs bathroom.  And to think I was going to trash that cheesy space heater when the roomie in question moved out.

      Last night, I watched  urlLink The Apprentice .  I thought it might be interesting to observe the business tactics of people on TV, not having any sort of a business background myself.  And as we watched it, my boyfriend realized he knew one of the contestants from high school.  Along with  urlLink Queer Eye , this marks the second time I've run across someone I know (or know via someone else) on reality TV.  Is reality TV becoming  new way to monitor the lives of old friends?  Perhaps that's why it appeals to the curiosity of so many.  I guess personality-wise I am a little nosy, so perhaps reality TV is a slight interest of mine.  Not obsessively though because: 1) most TV just plain sucks, and 2) no one should watch that much TV.

      This being a brand spankin' new blog, I have not yet quite decided its purpose.  So, I'll tell you a little bit about myself for starters.  Like many bloggers out there, I am a Librarian.  I do some web stuff and answer reference questions as part of my work chores.  And during it all, I'm getting my MBA.  It's been about a year and a half so far at the MBA, and it's starting to get pretty tiring doing the whole work-school thing.  But I will persevere nonetheless.  So that's work and school.  Re: personal matters, perhaps I'll get to that later.  I don't think this'll be a personal blog, so I may never get to that, or you may just have to find out more as this all develops.

      My headache went away today.  Finally!  Yes, the one from Wednesday.  I went to bed with a pounding head last night, and I woke up with it this morning.  But magic has happened.  It finally stopped.  I feel serene.  Now to start the weekend!

      I've had a screeching headache all day.  No matter what I do, take Advil, drink caffeine, drink water, it's not going away.  Oh well.  It adds to the haggard look I'm trying to achieve.  Actually, I wish I could feel less haggard, but with work and school piling up on me, that might not happen for a little bit.  Yesterday, I guess I looked so tired that another Librarian offered to sit at the Reference desk for me.  I didn't know that I was tired.  In fact, I thought the under-eye cream I'd been using for the past few years was supposed to magically prevent my looking tired.  I guess there are limits to its overall efficacy.  Strange thing is though, I do get enough sleep.  Eight hours a night more or less...always.  I didn't take her up on her offer...I worked at the Reference desk, editing a group paper that I'm writing with my " urlLink coffee group " for my Marketing class and answering questions from students, faculty, members of the fair city of Fairfield.  Today's my Mom's birthday.  I like my Mom.  I called her last night, and we chit-chatted about this and that.  Within reason, I can talk to her about most anything and always enjoy doing so.  So, happy birthday Mom, though I doubt you'll ever read this Blog since I've never mentioned it to you.  I guess that's at least one thing we haven't talked about, though I have talked with her about subjects I've posted before.

      So I went to a panel discussion on the  urlLink USA PATRIOT Act  on Saturday AM.  It was a semi-tough decision to go, as I usually do yoga on Sat AM, and I love Yoga.  But in the end, my thirst for knowledge won out, and I chose the lecture.  It was actually quite interesting, but in the end I left only slightly less confused about the whole thing as when I arrived.  As a librarian, I suppose I should be aware of legislation such as this that affects my work environment and the privacy of library patrons.  So by attending this lecture, I was trying to school myself because I believe in not abusing anyone's privacy.  They say that this Act is just codifying what already exists in common law, but it's the codification that bothers me.  Codes seem more unbending than case law, and I prefer more flexibility where privacy is concerned, as it can be a very personal matter for each individual.  My rating: All in all this act seems a tad unclear, even amongst the panelists who were arguing the pro and con sides.  Clean up the language of the act, and then at least people will know what they are arguing about.

      I'm doing an experiment to see how a collaborative blog for educational use turns out.  For my Marketing class, my team is doing a project on coffee...haven't narrowed it down too specifically yet.  Theoretically, we'll all post and share links and ideas online and see how much work we get done this way.  You can follow along on our  urlLink site  if you like.

      Well, the madness that is Groundhog Day is behind us.  I barely would have noticed its passing if not for the hope that magic would happen and I would suddenly be able to come into work today in capri pants and sandals.  I taught two nursing classes yesterday, how to research for materials in nursing that is to say.  Though I have no formal or informal scientific or medical background, I have somehow become the Library's nursing goddess.  I find I enjoy it because it's new to me.  Here's a  urlLink page  I made up on the subject last year.  Yes, I know, it drastically needs updating.  A page that's a year old on the Web can age like dog years.  Here's a  urlLink site  that I might add to it, but I'm not sure yet...how can they have a category called "Medical Journals with Full-Text Articles" and not have anything in it?  That's pretty lame.  But otherwise, if I were a nursing student, I might like this page.

      So, I heard from a friend that they actually read this blog on occasion.  This is prompting me to update it.  I know it's been a while, but I had vacation, schoolwork, etc.  So that's what I can talk about.  I was down in the greater Dallas Fort Worth area for my "spring break."  I use the term "spring break" loosely because I did actually have to take the days off of work.  It just happened to coincide with my University's spring break.  The weather was absolutely beautiful with the high temperature one day of 88 degrees.  I sh*t you not.  I really didn't want to come back to the cold of New England.  While there, we took in several museums: the Dallas Museum of Art's  urlLink 100 Years, 100 Treasures  featuring the museum's centennial exhibition of 100 of its great works, the Amon Carter Museum where we saw a lovely exhibit on  urlLink daguerreotype , the newly opened  urlLink Nasher Sculpture Center , and an exhibit on  urlLink J.M.W. Turner and Venice  at the Kimbell Art Museum.  We ate tons of barbecue and Mexican, and I am presently dieting in the aftermath.  Yesterday I went to a birthday party for the daughter of a friend.  She's 3 years old, and the party was pink and filled with balloons and cotton candy and a magic show.  The magician managed to take off my boyfriend's watch without anyone noticing.  So today I am pondering how one gets someone's watch off without them noticing.  I don't wish to become a thief, but I am curious.  I notified several colleagues that if they noticed me trying to remove their watches that it's all in the interest of magic.  I will give them back if I can successfully take them.

      How many times do you get held up on your way to work by a gaggle of geese in the road?  I love my drive to work.  As they sat there watching about 15-20 of them, I lightly tapped my horn.  They didn't move.  I sat there some more, and so did the kid in his car trying to drive the other way.  One of them pooped in the road.  I inched my car forward very slowly, so as not to hit any of them.  They didn't move.  Only when THEY were ready did they move.  I like the geese.  Yesterday, looking out of my office window, I saw wild turkeys ambling about in the trees and my favorite albino squirrel in the branches just outside my office.  Sometimes I miss the action of living in the city, but not usually.  I like my suburban wildlife.    Here at the Library, we'll see the habits of animals outside of our office windows, like deer laying down to relax in the middle of the day, and it affords us the wonderful opportunity to watch them and maybe walk to the office next door and speculate as to why they're laying down like that.  Do deer nap in the middle of the day?  Sometimes I google such terms online to find out just that.  Ah suburbia!

      So in my last post, I told you I'd fill you in on the conference I went to the other week.  Since some of you who occasionally look at my blog may be Librarians, I will indeed do that.  I wrote up a nice long report on the conference to submit here at work, but I won't subject you to the whole thing.  Just this:  Some ways to market your VR services: Instruction sessions, tours, Library home page, campus newspapers or Library newsletters, listservs on campus, faculty training and orientation, put it in the signature file in your emails, mention it on your answering machine message, have CNS mention it in their computer classes, Links on organization web pages, link to VR in OPAC, link to it in Blackboard.  For those of you who are not Library-savvy, by "VR" I mean Virtual Reference, not Virtual Reality.  What many Libraries do is put their Librarians online now so people can log in and chat with them.  It's supposed to be another way to reach out to our users.  Frankly though, at my University, the service is rarely used.  But we already do a lot of marketing.  So maybe people just don't going wild to chat with Librarians.  Go figure.  :)  What I also learned at the conference though is that not many Librarians are completely comfortable chatting online with Library patrons.  So do you keep making the ones who are uncomfortable do it, or do you give them a break and let them go back to working at a traditional reference desk?  For me, I'm fine with chatting online or offline.  I see no real difference between the two.  Or perhaps I'm just tired after a long work week and am just thinking "whatever" about most everything.

      So I registered for a  urlLink Gmail  account today.  I was curious to see what all the hype has been about these past few weeks.  So far so good.  I'd invite you all into it (I mean those of you I know), but I do not yet have one of those "invite a friend" options yet.  But if you have a Blogger account, you should be able to register yourselves anyway.  Now should I get rid of my Hotmail or not?  I'll wait and see at this point.  My burned hand is still an issue in my life.  I just read that it takes from about 10 to 20 days for a second degree burn to heal though.  So, I'll ride it out.  Yes, for you medical friends out there, I am keeping it from infection.  I attended a very interesting Virtual Reference conference yesterday in MA.  Once I write up a summary of it for work, I'll post my thoughts here.  I do get tired of older Librarians at conferences thinking it's nice to see a younger Librarian in the profession and asking me how I got interested in it.  I've been a professional Librarian for 9 years now darn it!  Actually longer than many of the older ones who have moved into the field as a second (or third) career, which is very typical in the field.  And if you add all the years I worked in a Library in high school/college/grad school, let's make it about 15 years.  So there.  On a lighter note, it's Friday!  Woo-hoo!  I'll be much more careful when I mow the lawn this weekend.  Also on the planner is planting flowers, perhaps catching a movie/dinner out, reading my never ending MBA homework, etc.

      Yes, I burnt the crap out of the side of my hand the other day on my lawnmower.  This is what happens when a person goes 30-some years without mowing the lawn and then is thrust into the role of lawn maintainer.  This person thinks she knows a lot about life, but then she realizes that she will have to burn herself once a summer on the lawnmower before she painfully learns not to touch it when it's hot.  It's my third summer now, and I have thoroughly learned my lesson.  Ouch.  On a light note, our yard looks great so far this season.  The dead patches are filling in nicely with new grass.  The dead grass was from an overly harsh winter and a Grub attack a couple years back that we're recovering from.  We have our annual flowers in the ground now.  And we have a new rhododendron bush to replace a dead one.  Things are looking pretty nice outside.

      My classes are finally over for the semester.  I am over a week-long illness.  And I feel fine.  Working in academe does have its pluses.  Though I will still be working this summer, it is remarkably calmer at the Library this week.  Only a few students are left finishing up their final exams, and summer classes have not yet begun.  I do like it here.  Work progresses (slowly but surely) on home projects.  For the first time since I've been living in my house, there are currently no leaky faucets or dripping pipes.  Knock on wood.  Soon will begin some electrical work.  The house is old.  It needs a lot of updating in several areas.  Perhaps I'll write about this over the summer.  It will prompt me to get on top of these things if I have an audience.  The big move is from a fuse box to circuit breakers.  From there, the sky's the limit.

      An anonymous tipster has just informed me that  urlLink yesterday's contest was fixed !  The coveted "BeadHead Blogger Award for Reporting Excellence" is found to be a sham.  I now realize this is why BeadHead himself wins the award every year.  In other news, I am now creating my own contest.  I will call it the Sooz Blogger Award for Reporting Supremacy.  Unlike the BeadHead Blogger Award for Reporting Excellence, only the World's  best  reporter will win this contest and take home the title of supreme reporter.  Let the games begin!  (Can you tell we're bored at work?)

       urlLink Sooz.net  received a crushing blow today when she learned that she had been narrowly defeated by a  urlLink rival blog  for the 2004 BeadHead Blogger Award for Reporting Excellence.    Her admiring fans were hushed as she took the stage for her concession speech: "I just don't get it," she proclaimed "I was just being sincere, damn him!  It was one lousy comment.  Next year, that award is mine."  Though this reporter cannot believe that she would "damn" her rival in a concession speech, these are indeed the facts.  In my humble opinion, Sooz's statement "damned" her chances for winning this award next year as well.  And yet her fans still adore her.  Go figure.

      I invited an old college buddy to join Gmail, and he never received my invite.  Since he has Yahoo Mail, the invite went right to his bulk mail folder, and got automatically deleted (per his settings).  Yes, if you haven't heard the Gmail news this past week or so,  urlLink Yahoo is crappy for sending Gmail invites to .  Fortunately, I was able to forward the original invite from Gmail to another email account of his, and he registered fine.  Yahoo bites.

      Something causes the brain to snap when a person sits at a Library Reference Desk for too long.  I'm into my 3rd straight hour.  It's summer, so I've only had 4 questions.    So far to interest myself, I've read through piles of mail I had sitting in my office.  I visited several web sites belonging to old friends or groups I belong to.  I've Googled up many sites and ideas.  I registered for a listserv.  I still have another hour here at the Reference Desk, so who knows what else I'll do.  Housewise, I finally started getting some things done with the electricity at home.  The house I live in had fuses, so we converted to breakers.  We have entered the modern day electrically speaking.  We had some cagey light fixtures and outlets replaced/fixed, so now no outlets or light fixtures go on and off by themselves anymore.  You gotta love the suspect wiring in old houses.  I had it all fixed because I was truly starting to get nervous that I would come home one day and find the house in ashes and have the fireman tell me it was that sketchy outlet upstairs that started it all.  So for those of you who've been to my house and can visualize it, the next projects are cleaning out the crap, ripping up the carpets, getting central A/C, and painting (yes every room has cracked paint).  If all goes well, the house will look pretty snazzy in a few months.

       urlLink Beadhead's  new subject of choice to post about is "The Inspiration for the Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm."&nbsp; I accept this challenge.   Interestingly enough (for some of you anyway), I did an exhibit here at the Library last September on "Banned Books."&nbsp; For those of you who don't know, ALA (American Library Association) celebrates our freedom to read every year with  urlLink Banned Books Week .&nbsp; In this exhibit, I placed a copy of "Little Red Riding Hood," a title that has actually been banned in some parts of the US at various points in time.&nbsp; Why might this "innocent" title be banned?&nbsp; Well, in one instance at least, it didn't really have anything to do with the violence in the book, but with the presence of a bottle of wine.&nbsp; "Red" was supposed to be delivering a bottle of vino to Granny in one version of the book&nbsp;called  urlLink Little Red Cap &nbsp;( urlLink read the Grimm text ). Granny was getting tanked. And if I Google-up the words "brothers grimm wine," there are at least 2 other works by them that feature the drink: "The Golden Goose" and "The Robber Bridegroom." This clearly indicates a fondness for the drink in the writings of the Brothers Grimm. So, these guys liked wine & violence in their stories, violence to people, violence to animals.&nbsp; They were a couple of sick bastards if you ask me.&nbsp; But I'll still read their stories.

       urlLink BeadHead &nbsp;wants to start up a  urlLink Random Subject Rant ® as part of a new collaborative project. I think it's a fine idea. The subject he has proposed I begin with is "The emergence of the term 'Toad Stool' in the English language."   Though at first blush, its name conjures up dual images of feces a.k.a. stool a.k.a. poo or the "vulgar" poop and a member of the short, rotund, tailless family of amphibians, this is, in fact, an incorrect assessment of the term. A toadstool is a fungus. According to the  World Encyclopedia , the  stool  part of toad stool refers to "the stool-like appearance of the reproductive organ" of said fungus. Now, keep in mind, toadstools are inedible. Stool as feces should also be inedible, though  urlLink dogs do like to eat it . Perhaps these fungi were given the name toad stools  to discourage the educated consumer from eating them, thereby not poisoning us. After all, we should all know not to eat stool. Hence, the name toadstool.

      Well, I am the proud owner of a bird bath.  We got it this weekend at a garden place called Q-Gardens.  They had pretty affordable lawn ornaments, lawn sculptures, and sundry outdoor items.  And it was about 1/3 the price of what some other hoity-toity local garden shops were trying to charge for the same stuff.  After my first Q-Gardens experience, I would recommend it to others.  I have yet to see little birdies bathing in it though, but that gives me something to look forward to.  Having a bird bath gives me a pleasant feeling of domesticity.

      So the other day at work, one of my professors asked me out.  Holy crap, did that make me uncomfortable.  I mean, we're both adults and we both work at the same University, so on that level it doesn't seem so "wrong" a concept.  But he is also my professor (Remember, I work full time and am getting my MBA part time).  That's just wrong.  I mean, I just finished a class with this guy...And I could very well take another class with him at some point in the future.  I'm not about to date a professor of mine.  No way.  Sooz don't play that game.  Anyway, we were talking about this phenomenon today at work...professors asking out students inappropriately.  Just say no...at least until they're never ever any longer your professor.
