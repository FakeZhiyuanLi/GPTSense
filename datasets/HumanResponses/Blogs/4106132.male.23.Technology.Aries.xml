         Wow! It's been so long since I had been to a gig. Recently I've been feeling rubbish - I can't remember the last time that I was really happy. Tonight I was really happy.  Idlewild are one of my favourite bands & today I was them play for the 3rd time. It was amazing. Ast time they were over, they were promoting their album &amp; so only really played stuff from that. This time, with their new album not out until next year sometime (Roddy's reason for this being: "I'm in no rush" - brilliant), they played a selection of all their music to date. It was fantastic.  I'm heading to dublin tomorrow - I originally wasn't going to go - even at dinnertime today I'd decided against going - but then Idlewild played & they are playing tomorrow so there's no way I'm not going. I'll be able to put up with anyone tomorrow if it's half as good a gig. It's quite a lineup - The Frames, Idlewild, Bell X1, Supergrass &amp; Halite (who supported Idlewild tonight & were a bit mediocre).  Also got tickets to go and see Ben Folds in Dublin in November today - happy days.  So today was a great day musically - I'm still on a bit of a high from it.  The only down point of the day being work - but even there I had a bit of a laugh with my mates.  Bring on tomorrow - here's hoping everything goes alright with my friends :S

      ...because it's not like I choose my feelings.  I feel absolutely wick & it seems pretty irrational. I'm very lonely, though I know that I have friends that I can contact if I want to. I dunno what's up with me. I've really been looking forward to the frames gig on saturday, but now that it's come about, I really don't feel like going out with my mates &amp; am even considering selling my ticket. What's wrong with me?  ...oh yeah &amp; Utd lost 1-0 earlier which really doesn't make me feel any better :(

      I was up pretty much all of last night being sick.  Wasn't the nicest but I seem to be a bit better now - still not feeling great but the worst seems to have passed.  It's leaving me feeelin really, really tired now though. Ah well, I'll survive.  Looking forward to seeing Man Utd play their first league match of the season later on.

      Ok, I wasn't sure what I was going to do.....I ended up doing something I haven't done since my real computer geek days:     Unreal Tournament: I really used to love this game.

      Had a really rubbish week at work - having problems with the upper management over my pay & stuff like that. Thankfully though it's now the weekend. That should mean everything is ok but oh no - I have to go and make things rubbish anyway. I'm supposed to be at one of my really good mates house at the minute - but I'm not there. Why not? I'm really not sure - I really haven't felt like I've been fitting in with that group of friends recently. There's not that many of them that I could actually sit and have a meaningful conversation &amp; I guess the ones who I used to be able to do that with, I'm feeling a bit distant from them at the minute.  On a better note, this week should be pretty good - I'm meeting up with the people from CSSM on monday night. I'm not exactly sure what we're going to be doing but whatever we do, I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again - it should be class.  A couple of really good gigs coming up this week too - Idlewild on friday & The Frames, Idlewild (again!), Bell X1, Supergrass &amp; Halite on Saturday. Think Chris & I are probably going to go out canoeing one evening as well which will be class.  More good news for me in that the premiership season has begun again - I'm a big Man Utd fan &amp; can't wait for their first league game of the season tomorrow against Chelsea. I'm going out with a mate to watch it on Sky.  Really haven't done a whole lot today - Got up about 1pm, had a shower, shaved my head (oh yes, i'm quite bald now), spoke to a few mates on messenger, messed about with this blogger thing (changing how it looks etc.) &amp; now I'm at a total loss for what to do for the rest of the night. I was going to hire a dvd but I'm really, really short on cash at the minute so I can't really afford to.  Anyway, I'll find something to do. I've got to start to do more exercise....but I don't think I'll start tonight.

      I'm having real problems sleeping at night these days. Not sure why - well actually I kinda do.  The fact is that I seem to be able to fall asleep at any point during the day.  Having got up at a reasonable time this morning I went back to bed & slept til lunch. I then had some food &amp; went back to bed. Also lay on my bed watching a dvd most of this evening. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't that tired (though I've made myself tired by doing nothing).  I just have been so bored with nothing to do that I've found myself with nothing to do but go to bed - It's either bed or keep using the computer.  Still haven't got problems sorted out with my mates. Ah well, one of these days things will start going right again.

      It's becoming a bit of a trend this....just about to close down my computer & go to bed when I think about writing something here.  I guess that explains why my entries are usually pretty short & I've not much to say.  I had a pretty good day today - makes a change really.  A good mate of mine was home for the day (he works at a hospital a good distance away), so we just chilled out this afternoon which was cool - it reminded me of what we used to do all the time until fairly recently.  I really enjoyed that.  Then went to see a couple, who I'd been best man for.  I really like hanging out with them too, they are really good mates. We went to the cinema to see spiderman 2 (which I thought was rubbish), and then hung out & had a laugh at their apartment for a while.  Anyway, all in all a pretty class day. ...I wonder does anyone ever read this? I guess I could put a counting script on, but I've given up on web development. Anyway, talking rubbish again.

      I'm just in from work & surprise, surprise - i'm really tired.  I'm not going to let myself go to bed now for a couple of hours the way I usually do.  I'm getting really fed up with the way my life is going at the minute - it's just the same boring routine:    Get up  Got to work which I hate - though lunchtimes with the lads are good craic  Come home & go to sleep for a few hours  Get up &amp; sit on computer talking to friends - which is great, I love talking to mates, but I hate using my computer.  Go to bed   ...until the next day when it all starts all over again.  So, tonights exciting events.....have dinner, tidy my room & probably talk to mates on messenger......great fun, eh?  I just wish something exciting would happen in my life every now and again - apart from the usual problems which keep creeping up on me.  I'm getting pretty jealous of some of my mates & how well things are going for them, while everything seems to go pear-shaped for me.  I am really happy for them, I just wish things could go right for me too.

      I really haven't recovered from CSSM yet - I'm constantly knackered. Ah well, it was worth it.  Still really excited about moving out.  Spent a good part of today trying to sort out insurance & stuff like that.  I really do need my bed....must start updating this when I'm awake enough to think.

       Got a house sorted today! I'm finally going to be moving out of my folks house & down to Belfast to live with a few friends. It has all happened so fast but I'm really excited about it. Think I am going to be broke for a year.  Been working on this site thing - being a former computer geek I thought that I should really code this site to make it look unique instead of the same as thousands of other peoples. I've kinda given up on that now. I hate computers &amp; couldn't be bothered spending the time coding stuff.  Anyway it's late & I need my bed. I've been sleeping in way too late these mornings  &amp; never make it into work on time.

       I really don't know why I do this to myself, I really don't. I hate computers so much - having done a degree in computer science and now working as a software developer, I have used them so much that I really can't stand the things anymore. But at the same time, much as I dislike them, I find myself using them constantly - much as I try to deny it, I guess there is still a bit of a geek in me somewhere.       Anyway, enough of me trying to make excuses about why I made this blog. I wanted this to be somewhere that I can just pour myself out to without worrying about people seeing it - if they see it, they see it & if they don't, well, obviously, they don't.
