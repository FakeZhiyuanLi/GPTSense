       So here I am.  I don't know why I am doing this.  I've never been able to keep a 'diary' or 'journal' before.  So why am I doing this?  I don't have a clue.  I guess it's just to be able to say that I have one.      Anyway.  What's going on?  My birthday is next week and we have no money.  I have school to pay for, so that is going to be the extent of my birthday this year.  What fun eh?  Sometimes I wish we didn't buy a house until I was through school.  But I know that if we didn't buy one when we did, then we wouldn't be in the place we are now.  I love this house.  I really do.  Sometimes I feel like it's not clean enough and that it's too small, but I really do love this place.  And I think it's best that we have the place we do because of the girls.  They can go play in the "field" as we call it and we don't have to worry about them.      I wish their birthdays were during the summer.  Then we'd be able to have the parties at the park or outside in the yard.  With having winter birthdays there's less options for them for parties.  I know that's not a huge deal, but it is to SD6.  SD7 gets parties at her mom's house every year because she's the 'miracle child.'  But SD6....she's told me before that she only gets to go out to dinner with her mom and godmother.  So last year we had birthday parties and invited my parents, my grandfather, my sister and BIL and my nephews.  We also invited his parents and little brother, but like normal they cancelled on us.  I think this year I might look into the jumpin jungle in town and see if we can invite some of SD6's classmates.  I can't transport them though, so I'm going to assume that most of them wouldn't show up.  The other option is for her to choose a couple friends to spend the night in our living room.  DH isn't up for this idea.  he doesn't want to do anything like that because our house isn't ready for entertaining anyone.  Well guess what.  She's going to be 7.  That's a critical age for friendships and that's the age that they start spending the night at friends houses having sleepovers and whatnot.  I don't want to hold her back on being able to have a friend come to daddy's house.  I want her friends to know the difference between the two houses.  At mom's house, she beats mom up and argues with her day and night.  At dad's house, she respects dad and her stepmom and gets her butt chewed out if she even tries to hurt us.      Sometimes I just don't know what to do.    Jessica

      Sometimes I wonder why in the hell I want to be a nurse.  Why go through this torture?  It's not even the beginning of school and I already have homework to do.  They sent out 'packets' a month ago with all the damn nursing math stuff, abbreviations, and some prefix/suffix things we have to have memorized for a test on the first day of school.  And we have to pass it.  On top of that, at our orientation last week they basically told us to go buy our books and have the fors 50 pages of our workbook done by the time we get to class.  oh joy.  this sucks.  Too much work...too little time.   On the other hand I enjoy it.  I can't wait to get into the clinical setting.  I know it's going to be nothing compared to taking care of Jasmine.  She's fed through a feeding tube during the night to make up for the calories she doesn't get during the day.  (she just started eating about 4 months ago and she's doing quite well I might add!)  And her mother is another frustrating thing.  She's such a bitch.  I don't know anyone who doesn't want their daughter to be healthy.  She wants her to be on a feeding tube the rest of her life.  She wants her daughter to be dependent on her.  WTF???  The hardest thing about being a parent is letting go and making your child as indepedent as you possibly can.   oh well....I'll ramble about that bitch later.  I really need to go to bed.    ugh  sometimes I just wish I could fast forward my life 2 years.....

      Work sucks.  I hate it.  Sometimes I wish that I could just be a princess.   They are closing down the unit that I work in.  For some reason corporate thinks that it's better to kick out all the residents and send them to nursing homes and then get more residents who don't require as much care there.  Understandable.  Actually, it's kinda cool.  I'm going to miss them all though.  I love the residents there.  They are wonderful to work with.  I know I have complained about it before but it's actually kinda nice.  Where else can I work and basically sit on my butt all night long?  It's nice for when I'm in the nursing program.   Speaking of...I'm so scared.  I have a math test in a week and I don't know what the hell I'm doing.  I also have so much homework to do that it's crazy.  HELP!!!!!   Ugh.  this entry has absolutely no point to it.  So here it ends.  See you later Mr. Bloggie.

      I was raised Lutheran.  I had Lutheran thoughts, dreams, and ambitions.  I thought that the church for me was the sit down in your pew, sing, and listen to the sermon.  Plus it had to have a beautiful alter.  So I thought church shopping would be easy when dh and I decided that it's time to find a church.  Boy was I wrong.  Church #1.   Bust a move:   A few months ago dh and I went to his old church.  He told me that I'm in for a shock.  I thought to myself 'what kind of shock could it be to go to church?'  Boy was he right.  We walked in and went downstairs had some coffee and then went upstairs to church.  We didn't have the girls with us that day so it was pretty easy just going and seeing what was going on.  Anyway, I walk in and my general reaction was that what I would call an alter looked more like a rock concert.  There was a piano, drumset, and a couple trumpets sitting up there.  But on the plus side-instead of pews they had comfortable chairs that you could sit in and actually be comfortable.  After a few minutes the service starts and I was in shock.  Everyone was up dancing, singing, clapping their hands, and having a grand ole time.  All except me that is.  So this went on the entire service.  There was a baby dedication that day so I got to see their version of the baptism.  Dh later told me that they believe that children should choose to be baptised when they are old enough to do so and that the baby dedication is the parents dedicating the baby to live in God's way etc etc etc.  Sounded kinda like a baptism to me except with no holy water.  So I thought that I would never go back there.  Church #2:   Hometown:   After we moved to town we attended the local methodist church for a few months.  At first it was great.  I liked it a lot.  But as time went I didn't feel like it was the church for us.  Nice church, nice people, but it was way to small for me.  Perks:  in town and services start later which is good because we work midnights.  Cons:  too small, no real youth programs, the pastor goes to 3 different churchs.  Church #3:   The Needers:   Dh and I attended this church one Sunday.  Nice inside.  And the people were nice, but there were a few problems.  The first time dh and I attended, there was a missionary there.  He talked for over an hour.  My butt hurt just from listening to him ramble.  Everyone that came up to us seemed "needy" in some way.  They all were so persistant about us signing a visitors card and coming back next week.  We didn't go back the next week.  or the week after that.  But I went back the 3rd sunday, this time with the girls.  They were pretty open to SD6, but when it came to SD7, they were standoffish.  The Pastor didn't even say two words to me...or the girls.  I told dh about this and we have decided to not go back to that church.   Church #4:   the weak:   all I have to say about this is one word....weak.   So in the end, dh and I have decided to go to Church #1.  I never thought I would've gone back there, but I really did enjoy it.  They make the service fun.  omg...a church service fun?  who would've known?  Anyway.  I think everything will be ok there.  SD7 will get the one on one attention she needs and SD6 will have a children's service to go to and dh and I will be able to enjoy the church service.  I wonder what would happen if my parents were to go there?  Hmmm.....maybe not just yet.  I don't want to give them too big of a heart attack yet.... ;)
