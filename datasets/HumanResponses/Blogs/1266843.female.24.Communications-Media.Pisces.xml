         I Nailed Five Shots!!!    Well yesterday was interesting.  I had to be at work by 12:45, I worked a Teaneck wrestling team party at the G-spot.  Then I had to get to the studio by 4:30, worked on stuff, almost finished with a song I'm writing.  But you know who just shows up there??? One of the two "sluts" I have mentioned previously.  Turns out, she's not a slut.  She was just having fun that night, I told her that we're cool.  I think she felt bad about it.  She happens to be cool with my producer man, Jeff.  She'd come over to hang out, and work on a paper for her class.  Haning out with the two of them I am starting to see that people (all over Bergen County) kinda know me as "the waitess from Geronino's".  I am the only one, ha ha ha. I wanted to get back to work by 8:30 or 9 so that I could give Mike a ride home and help Craig with the bar.  Bartending is fun.  Yeah I had a car for yesterday and today.  I'm gonna go for a drive in a bit. Work was fun last night.  Dr. Chris (as I affectionately call him) came in with his cousins.  He's so nice.  I used to "date" him.  I made a round of shots last night too.  I nailed five shots!!!  Woo hoo! After work, Craig and I went to the grill, a little Dino visit, and Craig wanted a California Burger?  We bumped into Jerry, Sammy, and "Georgia"  when we got there.  I think Craig was venting, from work.  He's definately a funny guy (and hot too).  He was making them crack up, although it was mostly at Dino's expense. When I got home I talked to Elizabeth till like 6 am.  I was sooo tired.  I still am but I am determined to see daylight today.  I'm gonna call Justin, see what he's doing, and prolly try to return the car to Mom's.

         We Drove All Over Creation    Ahh yes laundry day is upon me...Gotta wash the jeans, the shirts, the socks and underware so that I may look presentable at work.  Gotta wear black tonight, I hate wearing black.  It's so blah.  The normal bar staff should be back tonight.  I'd be surprised to see if someone actually took off TWO Thursday nights. I've spent the last two nights hagin with Sandy, the BFFE, ha ha ha.  She picked me up from the studio on Tuesday, then I went to court with her (good news, her case was adjourned till June, lucky bitch).  Then after the nice turn of events, we went to Toys R' Us and to Best Buy for crap.  We ate at Friday's afterward, where she continued to bitch about her manager.  Funny stuff if you ask me.  Wednesday, we drove all over creation to find her a dress for the AXP formal.  From Paramus to Newark, to Bayonne, to Teaneck.  Damn.  I'm surprised that she'd even look in malls for a dress, those kinds of dresses are too plain, too tame, and soooo not her.  We did find the funniest store.  It's like a cross between, Hot topic, a hair salon, a sex shop, and Spencer Gifts.  Lovely junk that I love to buy. I ordered shirts from T-shirt hell like a week ago, they should be here soon. Elizabeth got a job.  She starts Monday.  Wish I could say the same.  I need a job, desperately.  I'm about to contact FDU and see if there are any positions there.

         Don't Do It In The Service Bar!    Work sucked last night, sucked with two big sluts.  F-ing friday happy hour...crowds of people...two ignorant sluts.  On a crowded day, people tend to be very stupid, like mass stupidity, in the vicinity of alcohol.  I must have told these two chicks, "EXCUSE ME" like 30 times.  They didn't get the hint.  They continued to act like drunken sluts.  They were standing in my little section where I needed to work.  Where I need to pick up drinks, for people in the biz, the "service bar".  I am all for getting completely plastered, acting stupid, a little sexy, whatever, but I don't do it in the service bar!!! Where the waitress needs to WORK!!!  For christs sake, they could have licked each other somewhere else, not in my way.  So the one girl, waved me off, like I didn't have a right to ask her to move for the F-ing 30th time.  So you know what I did?!! As she was bending over backwards as to let the other chick lick a body shot off her, I pushed right past her.  Can't do much more than that, I have to be  nice  to customers.  Seriously, fuck people like them.  Be freakin aware, man.

      I just read Ilana's Blog.  I read how she met Cuba Gooding Jr.  I realized that I had forgot to mention that I had met  John Vetimigliano  (sp?) last Friday at work.  He plays Artie Bouko (sp?) on the Soprano's.  He comes into Geronimo's every once in a while.  This time I actually saw him and had a friend introduce me.  He was very nice too.

         Get Some Ass and Go Home    Elizabeth came to visit.  She woke me up, once again, this time she opened my curtains, she jumped on my legs, and pulled the blanket off me.  I was ACOSTED I SAY! ACOSTED! Anyhow, then Mark came over, witnessed my horrible stomach ache, where I jump up abruptly and say, "I have to use the bathroom..."  Gross. Why does Elizabeth like to wake me up? Is it not completely obvious to all my roomates and friends that I work at night?!  Thursday mornings through Saturday mornings, I like to sleep as long as possible.  Yeah I'm lazy, c'mon, I hustle when I work, and now I'm bar training, and I end up in there on my off nights cause I like to help. Sometimes I feel like some of the others at work don't care.  Someone told me that the bartenders are there to make their money, get some ass and go home.  Which looks like a credible answer behind why almost half the bar staff didn't come to my little Sunday brunch I set up.  While everyone said it was a nice gesture, half of them couldn't find it in themselves to try to make it.

         But You Can't Tell That It's Not Chicken...     Elizabeth took me to campus the other day.  I sent out 2 resumes; one to a hackensack position for training to go to a NYC location, and one to St. Thomas Aquinas college in Sparkill, NY (an admissions position).  Then she wanted to eat.  So she convinced me to go to  Veggie Heaven  in Teaneck. Elizabeth: You've never eaten at Veggie Heaven?!@%# Danielle: No, no I don't like vegetarian food. E: But you can't tell that it's not chicken... D: WHAT?!@%# Whaddaya mean I "can't tell"?!#%! ewww!!!

         Floors Pose No Problem to Him    So yeah, now I'm watching  Ghost  on  W e network.  Those women's television programming networks are stupid.  Anyhow, I came up with a question, that I proposed to Izzy.  Why is it that Patrick Swayzie's character is not affected by walls, he can walk right through them, but floors pose no problem to him.  He doesn't fall through his old apartment floor does he?  He can't push cans, he can't knock over things unless he's concentrating.  I don't think he's concentrating on walking on a floor.  Why doesn't he fall through? Oh well, whatever. So yeah, blogging, Elizabeth says that I should blog more.  Dunno, maybe she's addicted to it. It's like 3:45 in the morning, and I have bar training tomorrow.  I should go, Blog tomorrow...

         Stupid If You Ask Me     Well, well, well... Some idiots decided that for a good time they would egg our house.  Hmm... let's see, we're how old again? The girls had left for some campus event, Pete and I were watching TV.  I heard footsteps on the porch so I turned on the porch light (I thought the girls were comming home).  Then I went to open the door for them.  All I found were f*cking eggs on the door and someone jumping into a car and pulling away.  Then we realized that my roomie's car was completely f-ing covered in egg.  Stupid if you ask me.  We think we know who it is, but no accusations will come from us.

         I'm Not Saying Pot Isn't Cool    Elizabeth called my cell this morning at like 10:45.  Normally I would have wanted to kill her... but, I didn't mind today, cause last night I went to bed like everyone else in the house did...at a normal hour.  I was working on my song for  260 Productions  (gratuitous shout out).  Jeff (aka "J") will be happy that I've worked on it.  Then, as I've got my headphones on, I hear banging on the front door.  It's Drunken Sam, Victoria, and Laura (who doesn't seem inebriated at all).  So, Cat got the door, but we kinda left'em out there for a bit.  I went to look through the mail slot, and all I got was a huge wiff of Sam's Frito smelling breath. Yichh!!! Pete's comming over later, but yes once again I'm going to tha mall with my mom first.  I think she misses me or something.  Can't say that my brother offers her much company at home...sleeping or smokin the bong probably, but hey, he'll wake up out of his adolecent stupidity soon enough. I'm not saying that pot isn't cool.  We've all done it at some point or another (exaggeration).  I just figure that one can't appreciate being able to relax with a pipe until maybe the college age, or like when you're a productive citizen.  Going to work, going to class, smoke a bowl with some friends, whatever.  He started in high school.  Teenagers can't handle that stuff.  They're dumb.  I can't even give some college kids credit.  Pot is something you may consider to be a hobby.  You're not supposed to abuse it or get useless off it.  But remember, it's still illegal.

         New Jersey's Ultimate Tourist Destination    Ok, today is Monday.  I had bar training last night. I actually served drinks!!!  Well just to the regulars, ha ha.  They usually get single liquor and soda drinks.  So last night Elana let me serve the beer, the wine, single liquor shots (I gotta practice making mixed shots in multiples).  It's fun, bartending.  But that in no way means that I'd like to take on any Thursday night. Elana left for Florida's Spring break season.  She's gonna make a sh*t load down there for the month she works in South Beach. So, what happened to Pete and my's road trip, you ask?  Well, after watching  Swimfan  till like, 5 am, we ended up at Jersey's ultimate tourist destination.  We ended up at the mall.  It was fun.  I think we had fun just hanging out.  Having no where to have to be.  We saw  OLD SCHOOL . It was funny, but very dumb, but very funny.  I'm not exactly sure where the plot went, maybe to the bathroom. Right now, I'm listening to a CD Mark sent me.  I mentioned I wanted the  Something Corporate  cd.  It sounds really good.  I love  Woke up in a car , track 3, I believe.  Next I'm going to try to find the  DareDevil  soundtrack.  I think songs from N.E.R.D. and Evanessance (sp?) are on there. I heard the Evanessance song last night from the Kareoke DJ.  Also after Mark had me listen to it.  Anyhow, I told the DJ John dude that I had dibs on his new cd of Kareoke songs.  I wanted to sing  Beautiful  first.  The Christina Aguilera song.  So I sang it, and I got a little embarrassed cause when I was done, there was a whole crowd of people, of whom I didn't know, cheering.  This woman called me over and says, "I've only heard one other person sing it like that.  You've made it YOUR song."  With a smile, I said, "Thanks." Well, mom is taking me shopping now.  Gonna go get Express stuff.  Till later...

         $37 is Nothing to be Happy About    Well, well, well, Pete got a blog.  Ha ha, whaddaya know?  I like his angle though,  Pete's Daily Pet Peeves , a bit of a tounge twister but cool. So I was at work last night, stupid snow, only the cheap, rude people came out.  $37 is nothing to be happy about.  I had like one table that was nice to me.  So the girls got drunk last night, I missed out apparently, but I did see Josh and Kris at the grill.  Elana felt so old, poor thing, she's not old, but around me and people my age she feels ancient! I'm trying to order books online.  I want to order  Zagat's NYC Shopping Guide, Worst Case Scenario: Work, Worst Case Scenario: Golf, and A Culture of Fear; Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things .  I should start a book club like Oprah. Fav books  Worst Case Scenario: Sex and Dating  Chronicle Books  Pigs at the Trough; How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption are Undermining America  Arrianna Huffington, Crown  Chicken Soup for the College Soul  Health Communications Inc.

      5 pm, THE SNOW SUCKS! watching channel 7, insane snow man. News 12, lotsa accidents, 5 car pileups Elizabeth hates snow, her away message says, "shoveling the White Sh*t". Yeah but I STILL have to go to work, I just called Gary, he said I can call later to see if it's busy.  The Boss doesn't close for a little bit of snow.  Only if it's the famous "New Jersey State of Emergency".

         We're Gonna be Adventurous    It's 1:16 in the morning.  The 5th was Kelly's birthday. I almost forgot actually. I was out driving around pretty Northern NJ neighborhoods with Elizabeth and Mark.  Then I remembered to call Kelly.  We had gone out to eat, we went to the mall (I bought the best top for my formal dress), and I bumped into one of my old sorority sisters. Today was blah but somewhat eventful. I talked to Pete on the phone for a bit, but I was highly involved in  Driven: Lil' Kim  on VH1.  I wasn't able to call him back, I had gone to Geronimo's to get food for me and Elizabeth.  Pete and I are going to go somewhere this Saturday.  We don't know where though.  We're gonna be adventurous, he'll drive, and I'll suggest, "left or right?".  Hopefully, he won't kick me out the car.  Maybe he'll keep my crazy ass around a while. Jen and Laura are here at the house.  We're talking about penis sizes.  I preferably like 6 or 7 inches (NOT Skinny), Some girls like em' somewhat shorter and thick.  Weird stuff.  But yeah guys, we do talk about this stuff.  I just told Sandy, my best friend, about this site:  Sandy: Are you f*ckin kidding? Danielle: No y? Sandy: This is you life on parade why? Danielle: Uh, it's fun Danielle: I leave out the parts about my fettish for reeses penises PB cup hard shell topping, and vibrators. Danielle: lol, jk Sandy: You are retarded and have no life Danielle: Ok

         I Don't Have a Day Job    It's almost 5:30.  I've now eaten dinner, I reheated some salmon (mom made it) and cooked some rice (no phillipino can go without RICE!!).  Tomorrow is Mardi Gras at the bar so I gotta work.  Maybe there'll be some money tomorrow. Izzy just got home from work, I'm bothering her to tell me how it was.  "It was GOOD, It was a lot of WORK, dee dee!"  Izzy's great! You see, I live with three of my sorority sisters, a sort of makeshift sorority house.  Right now Izzy is rambling about a possible male and female draft.  Wow she's screaming now... uh, she said that she doesn't think that guys should be drafted forget women. I'm sure Elizabeth will have a a mouthful to say about this.  Izzy says why should we have to fight some stupid man's war, women don't even get paid the same in this country.  She's speaking in a joking tone anyway. What now, well, I am trying to pull it together.  I tried to make a schedule before, when Jen was home.  Her and Cat have left for class already.  Jen told me that I am such a busy person for someone who does nothing.  Thing is she's exactly right.  I don't have a day job, but I go to work 2-4 nights a week, I started working with the producer guy, I have to keep writing when I'm not there, I'm trying to get my resume out, It has to be a self motivation thing.  It's like those people who work from home.  I make enough money to pay my utilities (cable, heat, electric, phone).  But my mom still helps me with rent (that's the biggie), and we have a family plan on the cell phone, I'd be lost without the cell. So I'm trying to find a job that will pay for the big things.  I might want to move out in August, I might not, either way, rent in Bergen county is expensive as hell.  Elizabeth, one of my best soroity buds, and I are really comfortable here.  We've talked about it, the whole NY/NJ dwelling thing.  So we both gotta find jobs, that we like. (start brainfart) I would love to shop for a living (end brainfart) Pete just called.  He's cool.  A little reserved, but definately funny (or at least he gets my humor).  I'm talking to him right now.  He says two entries a day is hardcore for me.  Wooo.  We're planning a getaway trip this weekend.  We don't know where to go yet, we might just drive for a while and see where we end up. I'll write again later, when he's not looking. ;-)

         My Friends Get So Jealous    Yeah, um, I just woke up.  Is this normal? For a recent college grad to not have a job yet?  It's 1:30 in the afternoon, and I'm putzing around on-line...  I just want to start working in media already.  I'm not trying to make the restaurant biz a career.  If I was I'd have majored in HRTM.  I gotta find a job, even if it's for PR for my University.  I am slowly becoming a night person.  Even more so than what I was in college.  You know the whole Only-up-in-the-day-time-cause-I-have-to-go-to-class routine, when being awake till 5 am is by choice.  Now I'm up till that hour because that's what my job dictates.  My friends get so jealous that I wake up at 12p or 1 or 2 but that's cause my schedule runs later than theirs.  It's the same routine, get up 1 1/2 before work (well I end up awake longer than they are cause I still need some sort of daylight awareness), work for 8-9 hours straight then stay up for like 5 hours more.  We all are up for about the same time, but for some people getting up at 1p just sounds better.  This sucks.

         Yeah, I Work at a Bar in Teaneck, NJ    So, here I am.  On this blog spot thing.  Elizabeth has gotten me on this thing.  And it kinda reminds me of the whole princessmelissa site by the chick from Real World New Orleans.  I love that show, most of the time (and I think melissa was freakin hilarious).  Anyhow, yeah, today I went to brunch with my coworkers.  We sat around this great big table and shit talked, but there were only 5 of us.  Elana overslept, understandably, she worked late last night.  Some of the other bartenders came, Gary and Ron.  Some didn't (they will remain nameless, :-) I'm upset they didn't come).  Yeah I work at a bar in Teaneck, NJ.  It's Geronimo's, the G-Spot, G-Mo's, and on and on and on.  I thougt it would be nice seeing as how we all work nights, for all of us to go out together to eat.  It was nice we went to Chart House, it overlooks the NYC skyline...

But that's ok, she has a life.  lol. I was job hunting this week.  Had a job interview, went over to the dorms afterward to show off my grown up get-up.  I bought a suit.  A skirt suit.  I look like an adult.  It's scary.  Ha ha.

         He's All Izzy's    So yeah, I haven't blogged in a week or so.  Elizabeth is upset with me.  I might as well.  I'll just say that Elizabeth is doing  well .  Mom got her fruit flower thing at work, and decided not to share with her other co-workers.  a little disturbing.  On Saturday night Izzy, Tania, and Elizabeth and I went to Geronimos.  We had a few drinks and decided to hit the dance floor.  I looked around, checked out the guys, and decided that the dude in the Yankee jersey was all Izzy, and that this other guy was gonna go for me.  Not even an hour later, the guy was looking at me and the Yankee guy was all up on Izzy.  Am I good or what? Anyhow, I realized that I was driving that night after I had gotten a bit tipsy.  So I sobered up, collected the girls things from the back room, and went to get up the girls to head home.  Marty and his friend Mike (I know Marty from work) came over cause I was going to give them a ride home.  They came by the house, we played  battle of the sexes  board game for a few hours when Mike fell asleep on the couch WITH HIS SHOES ON!!!  Ha ha! all our close friends know that's one thing you don't do. LOL anyhow, me being the crazy girl I am, took my eye liner, and wrote "PENIS" on his forehead backwards so he could read it in the mirror when he got home.  Poor guy, no idea he was being laughed at the whole way home at 6:30 in the morning.  He took it well I'd say.

         I Think It's Dead Now    I think there may be a dead animal in our roof paneling.  This past weekend some workers the landlord hired closed up a hole in some roof paneling, he told us that he's specifacally said to them "make sure you don't close any animals in there...".  Whaddaya know... Cat is sleeping under the wonderful noise of "scrap scrap scrap" ALL DAY LONG! he he, It's stopped since then....I think it's dead now.

      Oh My God This facial mask thing hurts like f*ck.  I feel like I've peeled straight through to the 3rd layer of skin.  It's Saturday night and Izzy came home from work, and I was begging her to do something.  Looks like it's a night in.  So we put on peel off masks.  It's not exactly the greatest thing to do when you're bored, or when you don't like PAIN.

      I ordered a fruit arrangement for my mom today, to be delivered to her job on her birthday.  EdibleArrangements.com I think it was.  I just had to get her the fruit and chocolate one though, so that cost me a bit.  It's cool, what they do is cut fruit out into flower shapes and whatever, and stick em' on skewers I guess, and put them in a basket to look like flowers.

I say, "No, more like 4...ha ha"

         At the Frat House    The other day was Valerie's birthday, so tonight we took her drinking.  She's really f-ed up right now!  So we went to the frat house to continue the festivities.  I'll write more when I find out who puked first.

         I Made This Cool Shirt    I've been pretty crafty lately.  I've been making all sorts of clothes and stuff.  A few days ago, I made this cool shirt.  It's a one shoulder tank top, with a neck tie over the other shoulder to look a bit odd.  I saw it in a store the other day when Sandy and I  were dress shopping.  I didn't want to spend $29.50 on it so I went home and put one together myself.  My friends think I'm nuts.  Oh well.  Then I saw some pants in EXPRESS that cost like $98, so I saw a similar plain pair in H&M for $35, I bought those.  Then I went to a craft store and bought some embroidered ribbon and some sequin string and glued it to the pants.  They look cool.

      April Fools Day is almost over.  We haven't done any practical joking though.  Wish I did.  It might have been fun.  Someone we know tried to tell us the ultimate fool's joke.  I didn't believe it.  But it had the house going.

         The Lack Of "Hook Up" News    Sandy is a complete crackhead, in a non-literal sense of the word.  Apparently she reads my blog regularly (visit the archive to see what she thought of me writing an on-line journal in the first place). Elizabeth has told me that a regular visitor of her blog has informed her that he wants her and her friend to write about their romantic lives as well.  He apparently doesn't appreciate the lack of "hook up" news.  She told me this because she remembered that when I started this blog I stated that this was not going to be a forum for my idle chatter about dating.  This was going to be the one environment where my conversation was not completely about the opposite sex.  There is so much more going on in life than that.  Besides this IS on the net.  Why would I want people I know, knowing about my social life? Whatever, I gotta go home to Bayonne to get rent money today.  It's crappy out, I was supposed to go to the gym (not motivated today), and I gotta go shower now.

         Class of 2003    Uh, well, Elizabeth is going to beat me severely if I don't blog so here I am.  about 4 in the afternoon.  I just got home. lol Can you say walk of shame? no biggie. Last night was Elizabeth's belated b-day party over at the G-spot.  I brought cake but forgot to bring it out, definately something I would do.  So it's in the fridge at work, all lonley and stuff.  I'll have to keep it company later. I was working her party,so I didn't get to chill much.  It's ok, cause her other friends peaced out early! Her AEPHI sisters on the other hand know how to hang!!!  Ended up at the grill, EVERY NIGHT ENDS AT THE GRILL! Graduation was on Wednesday, Sam oh-so-thoughtfully remeinded me that it was exactly one year to the day that we'd had our little "car accident". FLASHBACK ONE YEAR, "Dee, I don't know what's with me today.  I don't feel like I want to drive today.  I think driving isn't something I should do today. SCREEEEECH...EEEEEKKK.... BANG....owwww, oh my god." Graduation wa hysterical.  I was laughing through the whole damn thing.  I only listened to Joe Joe's speech..."and Jen, I love you." audience reply, "awwwww..." Well thought out Joe, really. To all the Mazel tav's, the blowing ovaries,  and Cushcarones, my AEPhi girls, Oy Vey Smirnoff's, Malibu drinkers, "Vote for me!"'s, boyfriend's in AXP or T-K-E, parties at ZBT, to the redrum on the wall, to the "E" baseball player that got high with me, to ArielPhiXi27 to Damarela, to my littles, to my pledge sis's, to Sandy's inevitable need for the roadtrip, to Marty's sock pupet, to FRUPLES!, to Halloween being a time to dress up the pledges and like a complete slut, to getting wasted at AXP the night before internships, and roomie's throwing F*cking fits, to sleeping in Philosophy (the first time I took it), to earning an A in Rosenthal's, from Greek Goddess to VP, from green to white, and never loosing a Greek Week Fight, for all the memories they've made for me, thank you class of 2002/3.

      La la la, hmmm... Elizabeth is in Europe.  She sent a postcard, we got it today.  Sandy's crashing with us, she is now, "girl on couch".  I have been sending resumes out the ass for two days.  I sent to NBC, to talent agencies, casting offices, for jobs - not really for talent search.  I'm only blogging cause Elizabeth wants me to.  Heather just stopped by, she's here.

I was praying to god that the officer would recognize me from G-Spot (www.GeronimoHotSpot.com).  I knew him, but I don't think he recognized me.  I didn't get a ticket anyhow.

Cat went to Jersey City, Kristin's place.  Craig likes to annoy me on-line.  I hope Elizabeth reads these. The woman who interviewed me today was an AEPhi!!! (aephi.org) from Delta chapter, Wow! I so have the job! Cool lady, I guess.  Other interview next week, AM radio station. The house is really clean.  Haven't seen it like this in a while.

DREW (14th) SANDY, LISA, AND KACEY (15th) and URMEY (somewhere at the end of this past week)  I'm broke people. Urmey wants Heather and me to go to Biagio's.  Fine, great, wonderful.  I'm waiting for Heather to call me.  I'm tired though.  It's been along week.  House got sold, had a job interview, watched movies with "wallet", worked my butt off Thursday and Friday (got money though), went to the shore this past Tuesday, for Sandy's birthday, watched her clean the drool off her man's bib, kissed a guy or two, drove to Bayonne, visited gramma in hospital, and prolly more stuff too.  I wonder if the horseys were good conversation.

Not that my life is exactly so much more exciting but, geeze just once I'd like to see her write a story about how she got plastered with me.  Wait, she can't do that, CAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

      Well, then, hmmm... it's Sunday night, and my roomates and I have to move by Friday... Watch the impossible before your eyes!!! I don't know quite how we'll do it but we kinda HAVE to.  Some how, we have to find a house for rent by the end of the week, actually within a few days.  I also start my new job this week, like tomorrow, apparently, we all have somewhere to go on Monday morning now... how sad. Moving, starting jobs, working at night, it's hectic, but it has to happen. What else, let's see... Elizabeth, Mark and I went to the Liberty game on, what was it, Tuesday night?  Yeah, that was cool, but Mark left us to go sit courtside and flirt with his hotel dwellers.  So we had cotton candy instead. I worked pretty much straight thru Thursday and Friday, both jobs.  I was completely exhausted by Sat. morning. Is this gonna happen every week?

I'd like to go sing Kareoke cause it would be fun as well as the fact that it's Samantha's birthday.  gotta get her plastered... Pepe is out with some friends, Smoke that bowl guy!!!  ha ha jk. The girls started school this past week, and some unfortunately will not be returning to FDU.  Dianna! What Am I Gonna Do With out YOU!!!

      Yeah so, I'm going absolutely crazy... I'm deciding what I want to do, like, with my life... deep sh*t. I saw John Mayer last week (thanks to Elizabeth and her radio contest winning mother) over at Jones Beach... I was moved.  All of a sudden I decided I wanted to learn how to play guitar.  This has been a thought of mine before, but a fleeting one.  Yet after seeing him in concert, I relized that my previous view of taking up guitar (that it would be too hard), was just nonsense.  I figure if you're feeling it, it will come.  So today, I went on mtv.com to TheLEAK and listened to his new album,  Heavier Things .  I was actually getting teary eyed, I was so excited to hear it.  It doesn't come out till the 9th but I know that even though I'm broke, I will buy it that day, Ha ha ha. I also want to learn to dance, that silly Wade Robson Project show on mtv got me all rilled up. I should probably be focused on slightly more important things, like you know the paying rent thing, the paying your bills thing, and the going to my two jobs thing.  Don't let me forget the get-my-car-fixed-cause-the-battery-died-and-the-door-fell-off thing. Yes people we moved, we're living in Hasbrouck Heights now. PAYING RENT!!!  Yes, people, it's true! I pay my own rent now! Oh the insanity. One piece of advice, STAY IN COLLEGE AS LONG AS YOU CAN.  Cause before you know it, and probably without you knowing, you will fall into a deep hole of responsibilities.  You won't know you're there till you're there.  And here I am. I thought that I could put it off, and somehow, whether it be out of sheer neccesity, or just not paying attention, I ended up self sufficient.  Life happens everyday, and you kinda just go along with it.  One day you wake up and realize, "I don't think I was like this a year ago.  I lived with mommy and daddy, and they bought my food, my clothes, did my laundry, gave me toilet paper..." Oh god, if I wake up one day, and I'm the mommy I'll just die. Whoa ok, back to reality... yeah I got a second job.  Not only do I waitress at night, I work a few hours in the mid-day at the Chamber of Commerce in Teaneck.  I am completely Teaneck-ed out.  Don't ask me where to buy anything unless you're ready for a speech on how Teaneck has everything.  I'm getting Teaneck drilled into my head, I feel like I'm from Teaneck now, Bayonne? What's Bayonne? Yeah, and don't ask me to go anywhere near Long Island or Queens! I've been there entirely way too many times in the past month.  Cousins, Airport, Concert...blah, blah, blah... I got lost in Queens on the way home from dropping my mom at JFK Airport.  Had to turn around like three times to find my way to the right end of Northern Blvd.  AND I NEEDED GAS!!! I had to pump my own gas! Which, normally isn't a big deal, but it would help if I knew how to get the stupid locked gas cap off.

      Ahh, what else could go horribly wrong this week???  Where do I start, I think I'll just start rambling... Today I had planned to go into the city to attend a broadcasting career fair at the Javits Center.  Great opportunity to expose myself to the media world (resume wise).  So Sam, and college-flashback-Kyle, called and said that they wanted to go with me, cool, the more the better.  People to stand on-line with.  I really didn't know how true that would become... Well, they pick me up, we take the GWB in to the city, head down the West side highway, and get to the Javits area.  I call up "boli" (for those of you who know who that is), give him a heads up that I'm in the city, and we head to find parking.  We see tons of people carrying resume folders, briefcases, wearing suits, yada yada, which is normal for Manhattan, but they're not all usually headed in the same direction.  They're all walking toward Javits.  We go to a paid lot, park and walk.  We get inside, not before checking ourselves out in our "I'm-an-adult-duds" in the paticularly reflective glass that covers the building.  We continue to talk about "Sex and the City" as we pretend that we are manhattan white collar power females... don't ask.  We're looking for the crowd, and see that there is a crowd of people the size of a small country, within this building.  We follow the cattle call. So eventually, we see a crowd gathering at the bottom of an escalator that had been immobilized on purpose apparently.  This guy who must have been in charge of something (he looked panicked... a security guy would not have cared either way), was telling people that there was no guarantee that they would make it inside the main room.  I swear there must have been about 2 or 3 thousand people there.  We handed over our resumes to this guy who promised that they would be making copies of every single on and giving them to every company inside. Now, for the Javits center to have any event, I fugure it would be huge, plus it was advertised on at least 2 different large market stations, as "free" mind you.  Did they not realize that 3,000 people might try to come? Especially with the market sucking so bad right now. We stood on line for 2 hours, mostly checking out guys, talking to some chick we knew, cracking on people, whatever.  Then, they announced that the event was being shut down, at 5:30!!! What? What was that nonsense?  Whatever... so the three of us got the car, conned the guy out of making us pay, and headed down to the village for Margaritas. Apparently, Kyle shares my passion for the male species, I might leave it at that... I honestly enjoyed the night out with girls on a nice night in the city.  We talked about college, futures, stupid guys, roomate situations, waiting tables, and talked about 9-11 on the way home.  I just wish that the day had gone according to plan... They better plan another event, with better attendee rules. I met a guy, like 2 weeks ago, talking to him, hung out, realized he really just sucks. That's all. I bugged out last Friday at work... didn't know where the hell I was.  I swear everyone in the bar was a freakin' momo. Night before that, I had a little shit talking session with my friend with the yenta neighbors. That was a good night. I'm looking foward to Thursday; I took off work to go see Michelle Branch at Hammerstein Ballroom.  I'm gonna watch her on Hard Rock Live tomorrow too. Yeah this didn't sound like a bad week, but for those of you who were there, you know the insanity....

      Well, it's Sunday night, almost 12 am, and I just spent the last hour on the phone with Elizabeth. She is determined to take my blog hostage... She was trying to get me into this system so that I could grant her Admin clearance to this site... I have no idea... I just did what she said. Then she became extremely irate with the website... apparently my blog doesn't like her very much... So here's the Weekend Update. Friday night: Went to work... anticipating my Saturday night out (hehe)... Marty came in to work late in the night, so I got to tell him to take my Saturday nite shift...  he always wants to ask for my shifts, I tell him that I'll get back to him, and when I do, and tell him it's cool, he looks like he doesn't want them.  Why ask if you're not really sure if you want to? He should want to, he needs the shift as much, if not more, than I do. Went to the grill after work with Avi.  Grabbed some food, went home. Saturday: Got up real late, talked to mom's, and she wanted me to come down to get her.  I really did not feel like driving there... I have to drive to Bayonne and back 3 times a week now.  The gas money is getting to me.  I started to get ready for my night out.  Cameron ( loooove that name)  picked me up with his friend Jesse, and we headed into the city.  We were going to this surprise party for a friend of his.  We got to this bar, I think it was called Bar13.  Cool place, private party upstairs, good DJ's, people smoking pot on the roof, all good. Hehe.  I think I had like, 3 cosmos, 3 beers, a shot, and 2 jello shots.  The jello shots were the kicker, seriously.  but the coolest thing about the shot girl was that she was carrying a basket full of little toy things.  You buy a shot and you get some cute little refrigerator magnet or candy, or silly looking pen.  I was a little loopy and thought that I should steal this idea for Geronimo's.  God knows the crew would laugh at me, but I swear I'm gonna try it. I was definately in good company, the people I was there with were really cool... I vaguely remember dancing with the birthday girl, and giving a half ass lap dance to my friend, I was definately drunk by this point.  I tried to rescue him from some guy who swore he was better than every band out there, and was talking his ear off.

      What the hell, ok so it's freezing in my house... I know I complain about the heat but this is just silly...  I just got home from the bar.  I'm kinda tired but the day was thrown off by the other crazy schedule I have.  I actually had a date last night and I had to be at my new job this morning at 6 am, stayed till 10 then I went home to get more sleep, so I only got about 4 hours... in anycase, my new job is at ClearChannel.  Needless to say, I am completely ecstatic about this.  I'm doing traffic stories for the CC stations.  NO, I'm NOT ON THE AIR... ok, now, it's really a fun job, if you can be a dork for a few hours a day. For those of you who know... Why does he have to be so freakin confusing? How is it that he can do this to me? Why do I let him? Sorry that was a brain fart.

      2 am: I got out of work around 11, pretty early... St. Patrick's Day and all.  I think I was just bitter that I had to go in at all.  I figure it's ok, I'm taking Friday off so I can go into the office for the afternoon drive time.  After work, I was driving up 80, practically in Hasbrouck Heights already, and Elizabeth calls me and says she's at G-mo's.  I'm like, I JUST left.  So I drive all the way back to the grill to meet her, and she was upset that she was meeting BITTER DEEDEE, instead of HAPPY DEEDEE.  Rigghhhht.  Yeah so she says my blog has been dead since February 23rd, and whaddaya freakin know? (Last blog: Feb 23)  Damn stickler for detail. So here I am typing, and I get another text that my friend passed out for a few hours failing to call me back.  I'm way too tired now.  I really wanted to do something tonight, but--- bars are closed now.  Cause you know, that's all there is to do at this time of night, at least in my world. OK so texting, yeah that thing you do on your cell when it fits whatever circumstances you happen to be part of at the moment, is soooo tedious.  I dunno, is it cheaper or what? I think I have unlimmited texting. Last night.  Had THE BEST time just IMing away with Cameron.  He sent me this 80's quiz, LiquidGeneration.com or something or other.  We were yapping away for about 2 ours or so about all the characteristics of our childhood.  Everything from ALF to Dirty Dancing (Which I hate with a passion), from Pinwheel to "Hey Alannis...", and from 80's lyrics to I dunno.  And even when I was about to go to bed, I turned on VH1 and there it was, "I love the 80's Strikes Back" Woooo! Soo funny... Dancing Flowers, Hypercolor Tee Shirts, Oh my goD! Hehehe.  So yeah he beat me in the 80's quiz, he got a 70 I got a 60.  Oh well.  Ok, I'm IMing now, and the cell is going, so I can't handle much more multitasking!!!!

      Ya know... this blog thing ain't so bad... I swear I thought absolutely no one was reading my blog.  I just looked over to the right, over there, and clicked on Elizabeth's blog, which led me to Kristin's blog... where I see that I've been quoted!  Hehe, I even heard that someone is startng one cause of mine. My entry (scroll down) "Timing is Everything" caught Kristin's (I'm not sure bout the html so just click E's over there on the right and click to Kristin's) eye I guess, and she was venting about relationships too, so she took an exerpt from my entry... Wow that's cool.  I've never been exerpted before... am I spelling that right?  She had other insightful things to say about dating at our age...  "Love is a euphemism for pain and frustration"   ...sometimes i think all this frustration is nature's way for people to take the scary plunge into marriage... by that point, they're like, "dude, i don't want to go back out there. " it helps us to appreciate what we have when we have it. and, man, that's just the thing --- i am absolutely amazed that anyone gets together at all.  think of all that has to work out when two people date, then form a relationship, nevermind the grand commitment of marriage.  no wonder preposterous amounts of money are spent on tokens such as diamond rings and dresses and a grand party at about 80-100 bucks a head... people gather to celebrate an amazing feat.     Go click on her site... I vaguely caught a mishap conversation about a circumcision... Dude she's got a pic of her at a Yankee game up, I thought that was yesterday, that was fast... I am so computer illiterate...

      Mike's leaving tomorrow... I'm not sure when I'll see him again.  I've really never had a good friend move away.  I have friends who have had friends that have moved away, but me personally, no. He's probably better off in California.  Apparently he's got a better life over there that he left behind.  Now what could be better than being a server in the NY area? Just kidding. I'm getting all emotional over the same guy who when I first met him, I wrote "PENIS" in mirror writing on his forehead... (sigh). I wonder what life is like on the other side of the country.  Elina just got back from San Fransisco, said it was absolutely wonderful over there.  Anytime I talk to a person who has recently experienced the west coast, they always tell me that people in that area are so laid back.

      When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring There's no body to batter when your mind is your might So when you go solo, you hold your own hand And remember that depth is the greatest of heights And if you know where you stand, then you'll know where to land And if you fall it won't matter, cuz you'll know that you're right --- F.

      Work was AWESOME today! I helped break the biggest story of the day! Unfortunatly there was a major collision between two trains over in NY Penn Station.  Like over 100 injuries.  Then my boss had me run up the hall to tell the studio staff, so I got to see Stick (poor guy - he's on crutches...), and talked to Cubby for a sec.  Then later when I was leaving the office for the day I bumped into Greg T.  So it was really cool today. Then I took a nice nap, hit the gym, and I'm off to shower!!!

      Dan keeps calling me... Dan is the "Field Director" (woooo) of Cinotti's campaign for council.  I want the boy to stop calling me... hehe. He needs volunteers, and money, neither of which I have.  I can personnally do some things, like I guess hand out flyers, but get him more volunteers, ehh, I dunno.  And I definately have no money for that.  That's politics though.  They're working very hard, and I hope Eric is sucessful, and Dan might as well be in politics, he does a good job at being a pain in the butt, with good cause of course :-) Gotta go hand out flyers now...

         Timing is Everything...    OK, so about 3 days ago, I was fine, great, going along well, except for the job thing (work is slow, later for that).  Then sh*t just up and flips on me.  Everything went and got stupid... ever have one of those days? I had to question friendships and relationships, return things to stores, and vent my ass off in an unsent letter.  I wonder why people choose the relationships they do.  What denotes security (assuming thats what people are looking for)? Familiarity, comfort, trust, attraction, what? What is it?  What the hell are people looking for? To take care of or be taken care of? abuse? unconditional love? Now if this were me writing a month ago... I'd either not be writing, or I really would be on another track with this. Something happened to me.  I changed, although temporarily, I did. Something made me want to be with someone, and if I thought I found someone good enough, then why not.  No biggie. Alot of people are out there dating (I don't know if you notice all the pop-ups for internet dating services).  They do the internet thing, the bar thing, the friend-of-a-friend thing.  I think I would fall into the bar thing category for obvious reasons.  I dunno, where do all the heathy relationships start? Anyhow, people are dating, single, taken, attached, "looking for a little fun".  I guess all in a mad search for someone they can stand for more that 10 minutes, that they might be able to procreate with, or at least try to practice the art of procreation with. When do you know that you've found it, the feeling that you're content with somone (or your 10 cats)?  Some people are afraid to be alone.  Some women know that their sole purpose in life is to be a homemaker.  Some men already know that their unborn son is going to be a big college football star. Everything we do, everything, is to better ourselves, hopefully, and to make us more appealling to a mate.  OK, I'll prove it.  Guys buy nice cars to look well-to-do, go to the gym to be buff, macho, healthy, goodlooking --- psst --- for women.  And Women! Ah yes, women.  Women do prolly almost anything for a mate.  Watch their weight, get their nails done, if they're smart they go to college.  Well, I think everyone aims at college to be a way to better themselves in the pursuit of a mate.  All of these aspects, plus some, tailored individually to bring the type of mate desired. Some people are perfectly content being "alone".  What does that mean? That means they are temporarily selfish and too scared to share themselves with another human being.  Which is absolutely fine... But timing is everything.  You can't be ready to meet someone who isn't ready.  And if you're not ready, be honest and tell the ready person that's how it is.  My guy wasn't ready yet.  And I'm better for it. I'm writing this, because, in the past year, at least, I've watched accquaintances go through what I considered unhealthy relationships ( but, baby, You love me right? Yes babe.  You love me? Yes, I love you... God, shoot me if I ever sound like that). Sure, maybe I'm no judge, seeing as how I haven't had a steady relationship in about almost 3 years, but that's where the selfish part comes in.  I knew I wasn't ready for that part of life, so I kept my dates on the same page, and all in honesty, regardless of the level of relationship.  I was comfortable being me and not yet a "we".  I said I didn't have any steadys, but I did have healthys.  These are guys that I am still very close with platonically. People are complex creatures and have way too many ins and outs to even begin to deliberate.  All I can say is that (I told this to Elizabeth, she liked it and she's smart), both partners in the relationship have to hold the other on a pedestal.  Neither one should feel that they are too good for the other.  Now, everyone has insecurities, so at this point it's about finding a balance.  With fear of sounding cliched, someone who completes you, your other angle that makes you a whole, so that you don't feel like you're alone, or like you're giving yourself away, more like you're always reciprocating in a symbiotic loving, honest, loyal, lustful, trusting existence. I want that... someday.

        Ok so today, uh, yesterday, was a nice day...   I was sleeping when my cell rang and it was kissyboy.  HAhaha.  Yeah so he says, "Wanna go to the park?" I said, "uh, yeah, great... call ya back in a few." I knew I really should get out more cause well, I don't seem to remember what day light looks like, just kidding.  But it was also nice to have the chance to hang out with someone new. So I got in the car drove to his house and we loaded up the Jeep with his bike and his rollerblades.  I had dibs on the bike, I hate rollerblades, I can't stop, slow down without spinning, or help from screaming like a bitch when I can't stop. We drive to Saddlebrook park, which he explained to me actually runs through several towns. I had no idea.  I had no idea where I was half the time in the park, until I saw a familiar exit ramp near Route 4.  I said to him, "Hey, isn't this close to Biagios?" "Nah that's farther up that way." "You know whats sad? When I can only tell where I am in relation to a bar... 'Is this close to Biagio's? How far are we from G-mo's?'" Yeah we had a good laugh about that. So I knew this was supposed to be some sort of psudo date.  And me in my "oh why not..." phase, was like, "I'll just be myself, if I like him, I like him." God, it was like a whole day date... we didn't talk about too much stuff till later on.  At the park, it was like hanging out with a friend, crackin on people, sittin on the grass having a cigarette.  No awkwardness though, that was good.  Later we started talking about real stuff like, something we'd mentioned at an earlier party.  Like maybe I could write some releases for him.  He said some of the problem was getting someone to proof the outdated work, for non-current material and grammtical errors.  I said, I could do that stuff easy.  He'd asked what my rate was, (I almost wanted to kid with him and say "well take my [head] shots and we'll call it even", but I stopped myself cause well, that wouldn't be nice) and I was like uh, I dunno, I don't really do this stuff often.  I had only did it for a friend of mine campaigning once.  But it was definately something I wouldn't mind doing, and maybe putting on my resume. Later we got into the headshot conversation.  It was nice to hang out with the guy that's gonna do them, caue well, I won't be all shy when I get there.  I had so many questions, mostly from the book I bought a while ago, "Breaking Into Acting for Dummies".  Yes, I bought that. [sigh] It was actually pretty informative. So I'm excited, I realy want to get these done.  There's so much to do to prepare for headshots, at least if you want to make sure they come out good, and make the most of the shoot.  So I'm gonna get my money together, and do some shopping around (make-up, hair - maybe I'll get Kelly to do it), dig through the closet, get rest before the day, blah blah.  EXCITED! Ok, so he's a really nice guy... but you know me.  ehh we'll se where this goes. Oh god, Sandy's buggin me now, saying we gotta find somethin to do tomorrow.  SHE wanted to go to AC TONIGHT! I was like, rigghhhtt. Sure ok. But she backed out I would have went... I need to go to bed.  Might actually go to the shore with Sandy tomorrow, uh, today, maybe fishing, HA! ME! FISHING!

        So What Do You Do When Someone Kisses You?   You kiss them back... I guess. Ok just got home from work, well, the grill if you wanna get specific.  Before that I was at work, pretty much in pain the whole night.  Jeeze I need my vicodin... apparently, my wisdom tooth may be comming in on my right side.  It hurts like hell.  It just seems to be getting worse, or it might just feel that way cause I'm still awake. In anycase, I'm taking a vicodin and going to bed, maybe half. So, that last entry where I was drunk... uh, well, whatever happened that night is a blur.  I know this guy kissed me goodbye, and not like how he kissed all the other people goodbye either.  Just a peck on the lips, no biggie, but whenever this other chick is around, he acts like he's just cool with me.  Which is dandy and all but, just odd.  Like maybe I'm completely oblivious, but I seen to have this idea that the chick is his good friend, and maybe he's a little embarrassed to say he likes someone, or she likes him. (I only say this cause this seems to be a freakin pattern with me lately) He's a nice guy, my good friend loves him to death, but I still don't know if I'd pursue anything with anyone. Oh! Met the cutest guy at the bar tonight! He was like 3 clicks short of a prettyboy. Hehehe HA! I can't even spell his name correctly! Its origin is like Macedonian or something.  NumChe, uh, yeah. Too bad he's only like 22.  I know I know, that shouldn't be a problem.  But I like older guys.  What can I say? He finally came over to me at the end of the night, and said, "Why didn't you save me from that girl? Ya know, ya coulda said somethin... asked me for a drink, took my drink, anything." and he smiled.  Hehee so cute... He said he'd come in next week.  Which was a nice change from the usual, "So you gonna lemme get cho numba o what?"  ANYHOW... so yeah, Sandy went and got a blog, after trying to rank on me for having one.  She'd benefit from one at this point though.  But I'd appreciate if she didn't steal my background! Damn it! HAHAHa www.evilredpleasure.blogspot.com It's late, I have to be honest, there's someone on my mind, but I shall rest my head till another time. Oh yeah, Sam's having sex on my couch. Right now. Nite.

       "Blow me" he says...  hehe... anyway, I'm off to work, in a bit.  It's about 6 now, I'll leave in 15.  So I have to get gas on the way to work.  I'm a bit scared cause I saw gas was like $2.14 in Jersey City... NOW THAT'S A PROBLEM.  If it's that expensive in JC it's gotta be insane up here in Bergen County.  I swear I'm gonna go to the crappy Delta station for gas.  I heard that if you boycott the big companies (Exxon and Mobil) prices will fall.  I dunno how true this is, but I don't really go to those anyhow, they are the most expensive. SO I had work this morning at the station.  I was praying my car would make it to JC.  It's ok, just making funny noises now.  OK I'm leaving... gotta make some money, those damn returns aren't enough to let me skip out on work for a night. Oh yeah I hope everyones gonna have a nice Memorial Day Weekend! more later....

         Some Needed Insight on the 9 to 5 World     So yeah, elina is a close friend of mine, who most would consider the "lucky" college graduate only cause she had found a job that wanted her, right out of college.  She got a position with an accounting firm in the city. I recently had a post about my curiosity on the 9-5 world of employment.  If Elina's entry on our MyFamily.com site doesn't scare me, I don't know what will...  Here's an exerpt:  [missing section]  Frankly the novelty of the job being so anti-my-personality has begun to wear off. And they are trying to make me into one of them!!! I took this job so i would learn how to get AROUND the rules legaly, but all i do is follow rules... and not only that but i have to make sure that everyone else is following the rules too!! fucking Vomit.    I also don't understand y everyone in every office goes home at 5 o clock but the finance people are ALWAYS expected to stay later  [missing section]  y set ourselves up with stupid good damn deadlines that are always "aggressive" Fuck off fucking corporate world bull shit.   What kind of god damned sense does it make that i only truly live 2 out of 7 days a week???? thats 8 out of 30- thats the most depressing thing i have every thought of- and yes it may make me appreciate the great moments even more- but i have no time to take care of myself- i fucking hate coming home after work and having to CLEAN!!!!! i have to find a roomate in 9 days!!!!! ok i guess i needed to get this all out apprently  [missing section]  so i am sure i will be feeling 1000000 xs better as soon as my ass gets out of here- i love you all thank u e   I swear I love this chick, she makes me laugh... her rant on the cliched life of a 9-5er makes me want to run for the hills instead of look for that full time job... I told her to find her calling, her place, and accept whatever it might be.  This girl enjoys being surrounded by feathers, and beads, and playdough, and rocks, and anything she can mold into some sort of expression.  Imagine she works for an accounting firm... damn...

      I'm too tired to write even... ok, Cat and I went to the driving range yesterday over in Bogota... then tanning over by Rt. 80.  I went to work, and it seemed to get busy, at least at the bar, I was making ok money though, every check was charging their bills, meaning, that at the end of the night, chances were that the bar would owe me money... good sh*t. around 1:30a Howard asks me how many open checks I have... I told him just mine, and 2 for some friends of mine (Izzy and Cat came as well as Dina and her friend).  He says to me, "Come around behind the bar, they're hit, work the last hour, come now." I was like, uh, ok...  That was fun... I've never done bar on a Saturday night... wasn't too busy for me. Right now I'm making a mental checklist, as I write I also need to look up jobs on the internet, lookup a song they play on 95.5 (those dorks), and look through the paper for house rental listings. Oh yeah, and steal Izzy's issue of  Cosmo  again. I spent the day at Sandy's regular's house for a BBQ Graduation party he threw for her.  Sat all day in the sun, ate a few burgers, had a few beers, got a little soaked.  The whole time the dude is telling me how I need to put more clothes on next time.  Hahaha I was wearing one of those Paris Hiton skirts and a tube top, too bad for you! I like it. Afterward I stopped at G-mo's, dead, went to billiard place inm Bergenfield to hang with Sammy and Chris, ehh, went home after texting Cameron out of boredom.  I need something to do...

       Taking a Vacation  So yes the one big idea that has resulted from the day... I'm going to take a vacation. The idea is in it's infant stages and all but, hopefully will take shape in the next 2-3 months or so. I'm planning on going to London.  Not exactly sure when yet.  I'd like to go for maybe 2 weeks at least.  Today while hanging out with the moms, she reminded me that I was thinking about going there not so long ago.  Now that it's the summer, sounds like it could be a good idea.  Plus, my aunt and cousins live there, so it's an easy trip.  I might be able to hit Paris as well, but that's still an undefined detail at the moment. Woo, I'm excited, ok, basics, 1. It's not like I need vaca time, just about 2 months notice to both my jobs. 2. I need clarification on my responsibilities to CC from now till then. 3. Make sure the other responsibilities are taken care of (i.e. rent, bills, clear credit card) 4. OH CRAP! get my passport renewed!!! It expired when I was 23! 5. Look into ticket prices. Anything else? They'll come up in time. I'll possibly be moving in August so, maybe September or October might be better. After the move, before the holidays... who knows maybe I'll plan it for Christmas (ohh, but I don't want to miss the next company concert in December).  I think this is a great idea.  I have a nice trip to look foward to...

       Funny Looking Black Dresses  Ok, so Mike called yesterday from California.  I was glad to hear from him, seeing as though not many people would really keep to their word that they'll call after they've settled in.  "settled in" usually means that they've readjusted and have now forgotten everyone they knew.  I'm just being silly.  Anyhow, he's doing ok, has his plans in place, and seems to be getting that ball rolling. Today was graduation.  Yes, it's the time of year where all the people you went to school with line up in funny looking black dresses and hats.  I was almost late to graduation, I woke up 45 min before it started, thank God I wasn't graduating, been there, done that. This graduation was for the girls and for my best friend Sandy.  Jen, Shamarra, Valerie, and Isabella were receiving their Bachelors degrees and Sandy was getting her Masters (she got to wear pretty sashes on her black dress).  Did I mention, pretty much all she was wearing was the funny black dress? well almost. Blah blah blah, it was boring, what a surprise.  I even heard that the graduates were threatened with arrest, as to not throw beachballs.  Are you kidding, c'mon! So I snuck out the minute all their names were completed.  I ran home to get some supplies so that I could make banners for the front of the house.  Apparently I was going for a ghetto-fab tacky look with the signs I made. Hung'em on the balcony for the whole neighborhood to see. Ha! Well, we're going drinking tonight over at Burbon Street in Hillsdale.  So I'm about to get my hot momma outfit on and prolly be Sandy's designated driver.

       On-call Life  Just got home from a party in Bogota.  I went after I got out of work.  Work was ok, real boring for a good hour and a half.  But it wasn't tiring or anything, I guess cause I got to sleep in for a good part of the day.  Tomorrow, I'm off, yet I'll still be at the bar.  The kareoke guy asked me to judge the contest final.  That should be fun... righhhht.  I said I'd do it, I think cause I figured I'd not have much else to do on Sunday night. So this is where I talk about personal time.  I've been going over this dillema in my head for about 3 days now.  With all the responsibilities we gain as we get to this age, what constitutes not having enough "me" time?  (bear with me people, I'm a little buzzed) Seriously, start with the everyday "have to's" Some people I know have jobs like me, work in a bar at night, do what you can during the day, maybe go to another day job.  Others have the standard "go to work at 8 or 9 and clock out at 5" thing.  I know we're young and everything, but I think it's ok if we get burnt out once in a while like the cliched mid-life crisis guy.  We crave social time with friends and the pursute of dating. I bring this all up cause, after hearing everyone in the bar come to me and say, "Girl, you work too hard..." or "Man, you're always here...", I, personally want to rip my hair out.  I have all these friends that I could and would rather be hanging out with.  I mean with the constant reminder, that I don't need, that I have practically no life at the moment.  But that's responsibility.  I go to work to experience, and to earn money, and be independent.  Don't get me wrong, I still get a little help from the parents.  But for the most part, I'm doing my thing. If I decide to date someone, who might have a 9 to 5, like say the last 3 guys I've seen, when exactly am I supposed to actually "date" them?  Do I sacrifice a night of income to go out with a guy who might mean nothing in the next two weeks? Is it easier for people to hang out, date, travel when they have a 9 to 5? Duh, I guess.  At times, I desperately want to be like other people and just have that day job, then I think, well, that might be boring.  Is boring better than the on-call life I live now? ~~~~~~ Be right back, it's 5 am and Samantha needs a buddy. Continued... Sam and I didn't go to bed until about 6 am that evening.  Hehe... Sittin on the balcony talking about life, and all sorts of topics that are usually discussed in a certain state of mind. In any case, where was I? Ah, yes... ok, well, lemme get back into it here. ~~~~~~ People who have similar lifestyles to me, can do so many things that people with 9 to 5's can't.  We need a day off - just get someone to cover your shift, no waiting for vacation time or having to have to call in sick.  We need money quick - just go to work that day or night shift, no waiting for a pay check.  Yet, some aren't on an active pursuit of a career.  Some like me are trying to do both, at the cost of that ever elusive social life.  I get a pay check and nightly income, but I want to enjoy life a little... why... I think I'm gonna take a vacation (you should see the ora of light that just came over me).  Definately just hit me, it's over due that I took some time to travel.  I am such the person that prides myself on having experienced different parts of the world, yup, definatly going to look into it now.  I just got my return and a check, I'm loaded as far as I'm concerned, hahaha... wow too many ideas going now... If anyone's got an opinion please, really, IM me, or e-mail me damarela@hotmail.com.  I need to know what the 9 to 5 is like for people our age.  I've been curious lately. until next time...

       They wouldn't stop talking about clams...  Wow, it's been a long week... I had almost absolutely nothing to do from Sunday to Tuesday... lol I was supposed to clean my room maybe, and definitely watch  The Sopranos ... In any case, I was scheduled to help write the traffic reports again on Wednesday morning (6 am).  As I'm on my way to work, I wanted to call Jen's desk and ask about the LightRail, like if the train would run at a certain time.  David, my boss answers and tells me that he just got word that Jen was ill and he needed me in as soon as possible.  I think I started doing 80 down the Turnpike. I get to work, and he asks if I think I can do it all myself, normally I would have been quite capable, provided everyone in the tri-state area wasn't a complete idiot on the highway, but not that day... We have a new system affectionately referred to as the "black box".  So, consequently, both the Black box as well as the older system would have to be maintained for every shift, corporate thing.  This was my first day on the new system so I told him that in all honesty, I would have been more comfortable with him in the office.  He canceled his lunch in Long Island and stayed.  Very nice of him.  I figure I wanted to be honest with him, as not to look like a showoff or anything, like what if I freaked and every report was wrong... THANK GOD HE STAYED. That morning, I can hardly remember what the hell happened.  All I know is every major bridge and tunnel was completely screwed, and accidents everywhere.  I was asked to come back later for the afternoon drive shift.  This is where all hell breaks loose.. That was the day where all the thunderstorms were breaking out.  I swear I thought the apocalypse was comming.  People were comming in to my office from every department, even one of the DJ's, to watch the storm.  I'm on the 36th floor of a major office building.  Hail was in Jersey, Lightning was striking from Yonkers to Newark, trees were falling, thunder was interfering with our frequencies (ever watched "Contact"? The noises from outerspace were comming in on scanners), roads were flooding, you couldn't see NYC from the window, I swear I was sitting at my desk saying, "We're all gonna die".  Geeze, just a bit scary. That was one split shift. Thursday I came in again at 5 am to do another day of split shift, then run to G-mos for the 7 to 2 am shift.  I slept somewhere in the middle of that day, can't really remember. Holy Crap people were nice on Thursday night!!! Even today, I won't get specific, but I made somethin like 400 in 2 nights, hahaha I can go shopping AND pay rent! Wooo... Oh the things that excite me. Joe visited with me for a bit.  We hung out chillin on the balcony on, was it, Wed. night? Whatever.  I'm taking him to the company concert... The lineup ain't the best but he works for the same company, so I figure we can wreak havoc together at the show! Maybe hit up Manhattan afterwards. I'm so glad I have a good relationship with him, most people I tell that he's my ex and we hang out, they're like, "wow, I can't be friends with my ex..."  We're just cool like that. After work last night I went to the grill with my 2 buddies from the bar.  Dan (from the gym) and Steve (DJ XL).  They wouldn't stop talking about clams... Apparently it's a euphemism for female genitelia. I saw all my girls there, from the sorority, and we're all going to Izzy's graduation on Monday morning.  Bachelor's for her, Master's for Sandy!!! YEAY! Tonight was all good until [nameless bartender] got stupid on me at work... Ok, so I shouldn't have gotten all excited when I thought he was dumping a customer on me, I was just unclear about if it was a table or not... but [nameless bartender] gets spiteful, and bitchy, and won't drop it.  I think he has this complex where he HAS to come out on top, even if he has to resort to irrelevant arguments.  I can understand spite, if someone REALLY dicked you over, but seriously, he does it for fun.  He can be quite witty at times, but thinks he has to defend his ego to the point of just being plain mean. It's Saturday morning now, dude won't stop texting me, I'm hitting the hot tub... I'm gonna disappear for a while.

      What the hell was that? haha that last entry was odd... Anyhow, I had a great night at work (trust me it wasn't the money), Towards closing, like, half the Sugar Hill Gang showed up, then Grand Master Flash came in... I was like, "oh nice..." So I waited on them, duh, but I swear Dina is crazy... she was there and kept interrrupting me while I was talking with the SHG dude.  I come home and tell Sam (who seems to have company at the moment) but she has no idea who I'm talking about, Izzy didn't know either.  I was appalled.  How does one not have even heard of these people!?#@!  I tried to call Cameron, cause well, I expect that he'd appreciate the story, no answer, I annoyingly IMed him too, but I guess he's sleeping, Seriously, who else can I tell that would find this interesting? They and their small entourage all stood together, and seemed to be cool guys.  Even got to talking to me.  So that was fun.  The one guy thought I had crazy energy cause I was cleaning up like a mad woman, AAas UsUal... he goes, "I hope you're not all work and no play!" I replied, "If this is me at work, you should SEE me at play".  I guess a little flirty, but definately just outgoing. So they looked at each other in some kind of agreeance that I was "a cute girl" and that I "should hang with them sometime".  I'll just take that as a compliment. I think he mentioned that they're playing KTU's show next weekend or something.  Told me I should come backstage, hahaha... right, we'll see. Oh man, 3 in the morning, gotta go...

      I can't believe I'm about to say this... but I was having a conversation with my girlfriends and somehow the topic of guys and their penises came up (NO, Kyle was not there, surprisingly... she's a mess!).  So we got to talking, and well, if I had to be shallow for a moment, I figure there's guys out there who, unfortunately, don't have much, therefore give up, and prolly never get laid.  Then there's guys who don't have much, but know what they're doing, and they're not attractive (whether it be physically or mentally).  The guy who's doing well in the package department, know's what to do with it, but is convieniently "unavailable"... and the guy who definately has something but don't know what the hell to do with it.  Tell me if I'm wrong... did I miss any? For fear of turning my blog into a sleazy on-line romance novel, and fear of giving it all away... I won't get too into it.  But guys really, (if there are any reading this besides my friend who likes to spy, lol, jk) women just want you to make dirty love to them... that can be romantic too and all, but yeah, I think they want dirty sex with some feeling, unless of course they're psycho with major insecurity issues and want you to make "love" to them -- all the time. Ehh, just a thought...

      ok so after my lengthy-unrequired-unexpected-well thought out-self imposed apology, I get, "Hmm, well I appreciate your thoughts, and thank you..." THAT'S IT?? That's all?? I cried for hours cause I was so stressed and pissed, and tired, and seriously over worked, and ashamed?   yeah I'm better now... got a little clarity.

        OK so how does one forget to pay RENT?!@#!    My god, seriously girls... My phrase of the week has been, "Life is comming too quickly at me..."  I'm not complaining though.  It's just what I need, I need to get on that fast track to being an adult.  I think I was a half ass adult when I was in college, now comes the serious stuff, like, bitching about gas prices, roomies with late rent, scheduling doctors appointments, dry cleaning, get to work or die... uh, maybe not that serious.  In any case, I have shit to do, sleep is somewhere on that list hopefully.  My life is morphing as we speak.  I actually have to go to work, EVERYDAY. Hahaha, I know I know, "that's what everyone else does Dee..."  But for those who know me, I make a pretty good living working only 3 or 4 days a week. I'ma makin money now! lol Anyway, I got myself all worked up last week cause I was pulling this [previously unfathomable] 20 hour work day.  I was all nervous, went to the grill after G-mo's and couldn't stop thinking, and shaking, and freaking.  All I could do was keep thinking, "oh god, I have to get everything right..."  You know what, I got through it.  My boss even said today I had the best day yet.  Whew!

        Just Keep Going...    Today was a day where I chose to wind down a bit, although I think it takes at least 2 days to do that.  This week was not unlike my past few... do the usual routine, Monday through Wednesday, got up at 3:30 in the morning, go to work, write traffic, discuss the path of the immediate future of my career with my boss, drive home, do errands, take a nap, go on the internet... yeah.  Thursday starts the insanity.  I seriously didn't see my bed (or anyone else's unfourtunately) for more than like, 10 hours from Wednesday night to Saturday night.  Saturday night I passed the hell out, and opened my eyes briefly Sunday morning around 7:30... where I proceeded to freak out for about 3 seconds thinking it was 7:30 at night.  Oh god did I just sleep for 20 hours? Holy crap, ok no, it's 7:30am. Good. Zzzzz.   Thursday, after work, I got a voice mail from Cat asking me to call her.  So I called her from Rt. 3, and she asks me to pick her dad up from Newark Airport.  I was like, ugh, really? Aye, ok. What was I gonna do? Leave her dad at the airport? and I needed sleep bad...  I couldn't pick her dad up till 12:15 so I had to go home, I got an hour, what tease...  I go to Newark, can't find her dad for the life of me, and those damn PA police keep moving me from the arrivals area, so I have to keep circling the freakin airport.  I expected that so whatever.  I find him... AN HOUR LATER... on the departures level... nice.  Drive him to Cat at work over at Enterprise.  Flirt with her coworker, he's a sweetie but prolly just up for playing.  Go home, shower, go to work.  I get out at 2am Friday morning, go to the grille, met up with Dan, Steve, then Justin and Marty, head to work, and sleep on the office couch for about an hour and a half if I was lucky.  The traffic office was busy for the most part Friday morning, but still seemed to drag.  Not only was I excited for my Saturday morning appointment for headshots, which made me distracted all morning anyway, but I had to start making arrangements for my interview on Moday afternoon with the other radio office.  Friday night, work was ok, all I knew was it was weird with new people working.  We got this new guy who is a great flair bartender, but real goofy at the same time.  Nice guy.  Anyhow, go to the grill with Justin knowing I'm gonna have to get up in about 5 hours looking perky!  I'm nuts.  I get up Saturday morning, 8:30, pack a wardrobe, make-up, and all.  I head to the mall, to my hair chick.  She cuts me a deal on the styling, after I've just watched a bride and all her party get their hair done.  I was watching the bride do her thing.  I kept thinking about how this is like the biggset day of her life.  She kinda looked like one of my sorority sisters who recently got married and divorced (unfortunately)... she looked young.  I had no idea what to expect at this shoot.  I get there, and it's pretty simple.  There's a white paper background, some lighting, a fan, yeah a fan, HA.  Bart was great.  He's a graphic designer that does some photography also (link is to the left, BluBerries).  I've wanted to do this for the longest time, and in the weirdest way it was so absolutely satisfying, like I had found one of my callings.  I had the best time.  It was fun to act like a silly model for a few hours, and think about what kind of life might be ahead, if I were to pursue this.  We did some normal shots, action shots, one where he was like, "ok now, act angry!" Hahaha... The sexy looks are easy, just look like you're suffocating, dying and helpless.  It works.  Oh yeah and don't forget to suck in, contort and twist.  He said I did well for a first timer, yeay.  I saw some pictures, everytime he thought he caught a good one, he'd flip the camera around to show me.  It looked so cool!  I kept telling him he was awesome.  I'm going to build a portfolio.  After all that I rushed my ass over to Marc and Rob's backyard party.  Marc had asked me to bartend for a few hours.  I was exhausted but nothing like money to cure that ailment.  I knocked out, and woke up this morning.  Joe and I went to eat lunch in Fair Lawn.  Then went to Wayne to look for something for me to wear to my interview tomorrow... speaking of which, it os now time to get into work mode, for another week begins...

        La la lala... I'm not listening!   Oh, where am i going? Ugh, so, this heat is weird, but it's nice out, I remeber only yesterday we were shoveling Cat's Mustang out of the snow, and destroying a dust pan in the process... So yeah, Sandy wants me to jump out of a plane... and she wasn't just wishing death upon me... this is her freaky plan for her birthday.  I say to her, "So not only do you want me to risk my life for your birthday, but you want me to pay $165 to do so... why are we friends again?" Jumping out of a plane... can't I just buy her more  Hot Topic   crap like I always do? Noooo.  I gotta jump out of a freakin single engine plane like everyone else, ugh, peer pressure at it's finest. Don't get me wrong I'm sure it's an experience I'll remember for the rest of my life, and it would be VERY cool, and I'd love to do it, but I just don't know if I can actually do it.  Jump? yikes.  My head shots are tentativley scheduled for Saturday morning, maybe not the best time to do it, after having just waited tables all night, though, I'm VERY excited, I get to get all fixed up and what not... This is my first real step toward trying to get out there. Plus I have a guy who's gonna hopefully teach me a little guitar.  I gotta do it, I figure ther's absolutely no job stablility out there, so might as well do something where you get to dictate when you work.  lol, ahh, my life as a freelancer...(which according to that guy, in Bars & Clubs magazine, says is a nice way of saying that you're unemployed).  No really, I am employed but at this point I really don't know what will make me feel "employed".  I get up EVERY morning WAYYYY before anyone I know, and quite possibly so freakin early that I could have just come from last call, I go to work, for a few hours, and sometimes go straight back to work (at another job), after sleeping a total of 3 hours, not cool.  But gotta do it... I got my first like, really, big paycheck (Justin and Cindy ruined my high about it), and I was automatically like, "Oh god, I can't loose this job." The girls and I looked at a house, Sandy says she trusts my judgement, and we saw this realy nice place, really good deal... I wanna grab it, but also want to see if we can find better, but we probably won't.
