						   these last 2 weeks of school are going to be a little lame and interesting.first of all, all my friends hate me, so i aint gonna be hanging out with them, and second of all, since julia has crazy classes, her finals are going to be some crazy shit, and shes gonna be studying like crazy. im gonna be chillin by myself for 2 weeks. ...........awesome..........  today, she was apparently sleeping because she got mad tired from that bbq (which actually just turned into a booze-fest). she slept basically all day up until about 30 mins ago. she got online, said some stuff to me and had to get off to read a full fucking book (grapes of wrath). hmmmmmm........... i have an odd feeling about this.......

						   now, in my mind i always immediately think of the worst possible outcome or reason or whathaveyou. i am talking, of course, about today and NOT chillin with julia. the first thing i thought of todya when she didnt get online (she ALWAYS does) and didnt answer her phone (she ALWAYS does) and didnt call me back, was that something had happened to her. the first thing i thought of was a car accident. its quite a stretch, but things happen. i started thinking about how one of her friends would come up to me, crying, telling me that she had just gotten in a crash and died. then i started thinking about going to her funeral. my mind is fucked up like that. im betting that thats nowhere near what really happened. she probably just had some other business she had forgotten about and had also forgotten her cell phone. i hope. fuck......... i dont like this at all......

						   so im waitng t home right now for julia to get home and sign online or for her to call me. we're supposed to hang out today but its already 12:15. although, she did stay the night at someones house last night and is probably really tired or not even awake yet...... i dont like this......

						   so im not chillin with her today after all. the bbq thing shes going to starts at 1:30 and shes staying the night, so i obviously a not going. kindof disheartening, but we are hanging out tomorrow. this i guess just gives me more time to try to think of something to do with her. whatever, i can survive another day.........   oh, and last night i found out that the people i hang out with at school actually hate me and they want me to leave their little group thing (such bullshit highschool drama.....) so now i dont really have anyone to hang out with except for julia and i dont like that because i dont want to oversaturate me and hers relationship. kindof a shitty situation for me right now, but i realized that i dont really care becasue i have julia. so it looks like im chillin by myself today. and every day that im not chillin with julia. school will be fun.....

						   so, im not going to that bbq thing with her today. she said that its kindof turned into an all girl thing. i asked her if she actually wanted me to go and it was sooooo hard for fer to say no. whatever. we're chillin before the bbq thing. the only problem is that shes syaing that i get to decide what we do. FUCK! i cant do that! i cant make any decisions at all, especially when it comes to hanging out. normally when i chill withsomeone we dont really do much of anything. a lot of times we end up just sittin in my house not doing anything. i like that, but i dont think shed enjoy that. whatever, ill ask her and if she doesnt want to do that then ill try to think of something else.    but fuckin a, man..... im just remembering her face when she smiles and i cant control myself right now............ oh god, im so head over heels, although she is too, so whatever..........fucking jesus.........she is so beautiful.  the other night we had a pretty heavy conversation about what pace at which we're taking this. she is completely new to this, like i am basically her first boyfriend, so you can understand when she says she wants to go slow. she is also very jumpy and nervous i guess, along with not being a very "touching" person. the most weve ever really touched was when she hugged me for telling her something "really" sweet ("im not just happy that i have a girlfriend, im REALLY happy that youre my girlfriend") and when i kindof give her little pats like on the back, nothing hard just really soft little pats (she says she thinks thats really cute). this kindof causes a problem, because when im with her i just get the urge to grab her and just fucking hold her. im sure someone out there knows what i mean... but fuck, i love how it is right now sooooooooooooo much, but sometimes i just feel like i should be holding her, i just get the urge to be even closer to her and for some reason thats the first thing that pops into my head......... i just want to fucking hold her............ whatever, itll come (i hope...) and when it does itll be fucking great.   god shes so fucking beautiful.............i cant fully express it........................

						   anyone who has read any of my blogs on here must think im totally in love with this girl. to tell the truth, this is the most monumental, important, and kickass part of my life to date, so you can see how id get all wrapped up in it. ive said it before, but ill say it again: i am sooo happy with this. she is too. we match ungodly well, and i dont know, im just so fucking happy. this is by far the happiest ive ever been. so any of you that think that im lame or something for writing about her so much, thats why.

						   yeah, so i saw the day after tomorrow with julia today. not too great of a movie. i didnt mind though (i was chillin with her).my master plan, howerev, was foiled. like ive said earlier, i was planning on holding her hand today (laugh it up motherfuckers.....) but like i said, its "that time of month" again for her right now and she said that if she has her hands in her pockets the whole time to take it as not too great of a sign. well, they werent in her pockets, but rather crossed in front of her chest. i wasnt going to reach over and just grab one of her hands; that would not go well. so i just chilled and waited, but my moment never came. but i am chillin with her at some bbq thing on sunday. i WILL, and repeat WILL, hold her hand then. i will not sit by and just let that shit never happen. i dont give a fuck. im doing it.

						   apparently its her period this week. i dont want to do anything to piss her off since she is so prone to be anyway. but she is so sweet: she felt sh eneeded to warn me about it. she said that this week is her "angry/get annoyed really easily" week and that i shouldnt take anything she says to heart. im actually going to day after tomorrow with her tomorrow. gonna move in for the hand. only semi-nervous though. apparently shes been mentally preparing herself for it. thats so cute. im also going to a picnic/bbq with her on sunday. should be fun although i wa kinda hoping that just me and her could hang out on sunday, but like i said before, im happy just to be doing anything with her.  im swooning so hard......

						   oh my god. she is so sweet. shes working today right after school (3:30-8:30) and she just came home to sign on to say hi to me. that is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done. it really reestablishes (to me) that she actually likes me too. in the past relationships of mine have been pretty one-sided; i.e. i really like the chick and the chick either likes me a very little bit or not at all. this is so great becasue we feel the same about eachother. fuckin shit. im so dam happy.........

						   well isnt this ironic. yesterday julia got mad sick and said she wouldn be going to school or working today. so i was like "aiight, the wait will make it only that much better (talking of course of holding hands)" so overnight i managed to get mad sick, well only halfway. i wanted to stay home for 2 reasons: get better, and to talk to her while shes at home sick. so here i am, sick at home. i was talking to her about a half an hour ago and this is what she said: "yeah, i feel much better and im going to school and work later tonight". BAM! what the fuck is that? the only reason im pissed is because i had a feeling this would happen. i had a feeling that id get sick overnight and shed get better and the only reason that we couldnt chill was because i was sick. and here it is......... what the hell.......... i guess though, there is a brighter side to all this: the wait will make seeing her that much better. plus we're chilli on saturday AND sunday. we're going to a bbq (hopefully) on sunday at a mutual friends house. i dont know. im still mad happy even though i am sick and am not going to see her for like a day or so. fuck.....i sound so lovesick. i think that being with her is so great (even though its only been a wee and 3 days, 2 weeks on sunday) because we understand eachother so well. we both worry about the same dumb things that we dont have to and its just so "cute" how well we work together. this is by far the best relationship ive ever had. im so fucking happy...........   and on an un-julia related note:  apparently a great aunt of mine is dying. i dont even know her but my mom is pretty shook up about it. shes going to see her on thursday and coming home sunday. i feel really bad for her.

						   chilled with julia at lunch today but then got really fucked up somehow. i got all tired and i felt like i was gonna pass out. lame shit. whatever, hanging out with her tomorrow at wednesday night market, gonna hold her hand, youve heard it all......  still happy as hell......

						   im chillin with my girlfriend on wednesday at our local wednesday night market. the market itself is REALLY REALLY lame, but shes working that night on the same street as the market, so im going to chill with her at her work. this is gonna sound lame to anyone reading, but we're taking this REALLY REALYY slow. weve hugged once, and (im gonna sound lame as hell saying this but...) im going to hold her hand on wednesday. we're both really take-things-slowly people. but im happy as hell, and im also really happy that this one isnt consuming me (my past girlfriends/relationships had taken control of my life, all i ever did was worry about fucking up or if shes pissed or if im gonna get fucked over.......not a pretty sight) yeah, as ive mentioned before, im incredibly happy. this rules. the other night when i chilled with her for 9 hours, i: got home, got a bowl of cereal, went into my room, put the postal service cd on, turned the lights off, and just thought about the day while eating my cereal. thats so damn emo. im emo. but im happy. so it fuckin rules. god im happy........

						   yesterday i chilled with my girlfriend julia for nearly 9 hours. it was fuckin awesome. i love spending time with her. i think the only reason i made this blog thing was so i can have somewhere to spill my guts everyday, and thats really all going to be about julia. weve been together for one week, but i dont know, its the best ever. i cant quite describe the emotion im feeling right now, but it is beyond happiness. apparently im her best and most romantic reationship to date, and she is mine, so we're both incredibly happy.

						   music of the moment: such great heights (remix) - the postal service  yeah ,i dont know. i may be going to market today with dillon and ryan. hopefully someone else will want to come as well. i just need something to do, somewhere to go where there are more people than my e-friends on my computer. pahardcores great but i need real people in my life, a special person for me, friends that are rad beyond beyond rad. i love the friends i got now, but i do need more and i feel i need a lady-friend too (but i wont go into that in this post). pretty much these days i spend all my time with basically one person, hes rad, but i need more people. maybe ill call up some of the people that put their phone number in my yearbook (even though i know they put it in out of yearbook-signing habit).  empty places high dry spaces of uninhabited landscape dead trees and burnt leaves the gamma holocaust is overwhelming lonely loves friends, acquaitances, noone concrete raindows driven on by vacant cars empty lives, fost loves, forgotten friendships all of this is  is uncomparable to what what is this life, love its all gone, empty, lost fingers sore, eyes dried pixels contorting reality the rhythmic bloodflow of the city is it is faint but still there expeditions, adventures neccessary to live happilly expeditions, adventures loneliness is unexistant friends, loved more everyday loves, lost more, mourned for each hour the flow is what keeps it all going the beat, the rhythm, the flow friends come with the flow loves come with the friends i need the flow

						   music of the moment: noone will ever love you - the velvet teen  so yeah, in terms of julia im not sure if i should stay away from her or try to see more of her (this all to get over her). i think that if i saty away from her it wont be that bad because i dont have those "feelings" when im not around her, but at the same time i think that the next time i see her it will just be a last night repeat. on the other hand if i try ot see more of her i thinkill be able to start looking at her more as a friend and not as something else, but i think that it would be hard asa hell to do so because every time i see her itll be just another last night. FUCKIN SHIT!

						   music of the moment: back from space - amon tobin  so yeah, tonight i chilled with julia (my ex) and im so pissed off right now. i cant even really percisely say why.  so me and my friend went down to her work because we were gonna go somewhere for dinner and we hadnt decided yet. we went down there and chilled there for like 30 mins as she was closing up the shop. in there i was noticing myself acting around her how i was in the time leading up to us "going out" i.e. flirting like a mutha and reeeeeeeally enjoying her company. once that was overwith (being inside as she was closing up), we stood outside for like 15 more minutes trying desperately to figure out somewhere to go for food. we ended up going to this mexican restaurant down the street and as we were waiting for our food i found myself acting the same as i was when we were in her store. i didnt like that [i]at all[/i]. so we got our food and drove up to some park to eat it. keep in mind that my friend was there the whole time probably helping me to be less awkward and uncomfortable - thank you dillon. we ate our food at some bench and i tried reeeeeeeeeeeeeally hard to not flirt with her but i just ended up insulting her and acting like a jackass the whole time. fuck. we sat there (me ungodly uncomfortable with myself) and had a little dumb bullshit talk, you know, making dumb jokes and whatnot. then my friend calls her out of the blue and ends up coming down to the pak to chill with us. we ended up standing around his car for a bit trying to figure out what to do. we decided to meet at my friends car (the one who i was with at julias store) and figure something out to do once we got there. nope. nothin havin. we chilled outside there for like another half an hour trying (again) to figure out what to do. now, this was prolly the point where i was most re-diggin on her. that was so lame, oh my god. there was one point where she was laying on her car and i wsa just thinking "fuck, if we were still together id be laying on her car with her." im only half-disgusted with myself for thinking that only because when we were "going out" we werent really "going out." like at all. we were just people that verbally expressed our adoration and admiration of eachother. what really got to me tonight was that it was not unlike when we were "going out," and i just kept thinking, fuck, i dont even know, my mind is awhirl right now, cant figure things out entirely. on the way back (with the original friend) i asked him if he noticed me flirting a lot (just to see how blatant it was). he said he cant usually tell when someones flirting or not. hes lying. he knows exactly what i was doing and to what extent it was being done. and now i am here, (attempting to) express my odd thoughts in my head and how they got there and why. as you can tell i cant. i guess what it comes down to is this: i still reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally like her. and for that im fucked. awesome.

						   (everyone seems to do this so i will too...) music of the moment: death cab - new year  earlier to day i had something in mind ot post on here. now i cant remember it. damn, this is annoying.   my friend had break up bash with his girlfriend of 4 months the other day. he said he hasnt been feelin it for about 3 weeks, and now hes already on the prowl again. fuck him. my other friend is gettin along with some chick and my other friend is gettin along with a friend of that chick. fuck them all. i want someone so bad. goddammit.  i talked to julia the other day. that was a little odd. i felt some tense undertones in our conversation that i did not like at all. fuck that. at least we're still on talking terms.  fuck, apparently a bunch of people i know know about this blog of mine. i dont like that at all. im thinking of changing it or using a different service or something. hahahaha, they wont like that when they read it.  went to clos on friday - best fuckin show ive  ever been to at clos. damn. first off there was john courage, a kindof country type thing with no drummer, actually they do - its the audience's hands and feet. then came DERIVATIVE!!!!!!!! so great, such a fucking cool jazz/funk/hip-hop thing!!!!! they fuckin rocked as shit! then was my friends band - girls in suede. they were sooooooo good. they have really tightened up and perfected their songs and their playing. shit they were good. i was so sore on saturday from rockin so hard on fiday......goddamn.....  fuck......still cant remember what i was gonna say........ill get back to this when i do........

						   ok many developements in my life:  1. school is out. no more for 3 whole months. best news ive gotten in a long time. this is gonna be rad.  2. i think im back on track with my friends. things seem to be going good with all of them. thats good, now ill have something to do over the summer.  3. i already said that julia broke it off with me at the beginning of this week. not cool. shits just been really crazy for her lately and i just make it crazier. i dont know though; we werent really "going out" in the traditional sense, we were more just friends that verbally expressed our admiration and such about each other. we were really emotionally close, but thats about it. if we were physically closer, i think this would have been way harder for me. its not that bad though, although i am sad that we wont be talking much anymore, thats shitty. i dont know though, i think im already at least a little over it.  4. things with the guy (from "suicide") seem to be back together now. there havent been anymore blow-ups or anything like that, and we seem to be on good terms........although i do feel a certain underlying tension between us.........lame. we seem to be back to normal, i know i want it to be..............  5. ive decided that this summer i WILL go find more friends. its really not that hard. but yeah, i want more friends that are more like me, into that same shit im into, just good people.   well, i guess thats it for now. later

						   well, tonight julia broke it off. she dumped me. she said that right now she has too much going on in her life and that i juat made things for her that much more crazy. yeah, im saddened, but i kindof saw it coming. its lame and all. yeah. fuck.

						   so tonight a friend told me online that for the past 4 years he has been contemplating suicide. he was telling me the most intimate details of his mind and he placed his trust in me to not tell. he stopped responding to my ims for an hour, so i got really fucking scared and i told my parents. this is one thing he told me not to do. he said that if i told anyone, the shit would hit the fan. i told my parents. i betrayed his trust. my parents called his mom (divorced) and she called him. he called me a few minutes later and asked what the fuck i did. i told him and he replied with a quick "fuck you" and a hang up. i feel like shit. i betrayed one of my best friends trust at a time when he felt he needed it the most he ever has. i do feel however that i did the right thing. he will (hopefully) be getting help. but i still feel like shit because i lost one of my best friends. i know i sound selfish as hell right now, but i really do care about him. thats why i told, and thats why he hates me.  i did the right thing, but at the expense of a good friend.

						   everythings cool in julia land. she just has some shit she has to work through (stress, school, work...) so really her change of persona has nothing to do with me. that made me really happy. i said: "is everything cool between you and me?" she replied: "yeah, everythings fine" i said: "ok, because i know eveything is cool on my side..." she replied: "yeah, its all cool over here too"  that made me happy.  now i know everythings cool (i hope) and i just need to give her some time to work some shit out. she said after this week thingsll be better. im so happy for her. i was worried for a while, but now, i know shes ok.  (sigh of relief).........

						   so, im sensing something may have gone awry. i dont know, i dont like this. there may be a problem with me and julia and i intend to figure/work it out. we both, however, told eachother that we'd be completely honest about how we felt, so if she had some problem with me, im hoping shed tell me. im going to talk to her and put all this hopefully needless stress and paranoia behind me. i dont have a very good feeling about this..................

"less talk, more rock!" was the battle cry of the night, bitch. yeah, little cats awesome as shit and velvet teen is so damn good live. im a little ho - i bought all their cds. whatever. bitch. the crowd was fucking huge and it was hot and people were everywhere and there was no room anywhere and it sucked for those reasons only. at one point, these two bitche-ass gilrs just cut their way through the crowd and decided to stand directly in front of me and dillon. fuck that! haha, i did the hard gun thing (hand in the shape of a gun) and put it to her head. it accidentally touched her head and she turned around and i was just like "yo what up," all while julan and dillon were laughing really fucking hard. heh, awesome. little cat owns electronic shit. his stuff really reminds me of the stuff i used to make on fruity loops, just A LOT A LOT A LOT better. the velvet teen was rad, it was cool, they dedicated that show to logan whitehurst (their ex-drummer. ex because of brain cancer) and that just kicked ass. he was actually there, but he had an eye-patch and a cane. shit. i think i managed to piss julian off, and for that im sorry, but whatever, but like i said, theres nothing i (or anyone else for that matter) can do about it now. but all in all, a good show - the americas were pretty cool, the 2 other bands werent that bad, and velvet teen and little cat owned the fuckin house. bitches.......  and now for the really pressing issue:  julia . fuckin shit!!!!!!! this is so shitty!!!!!! i hate this so much!!!!!!!! fuckin shit.... hmmmmm, i think im just gonna tell her the next time i chill with her (not going to tell her online again, thats lame). yeah. im gonna do that. this is just rediculous, i cant stand it anymore. ill tell her and i hope that will help me in some way. no idea how, but i hope it will. hmmmm..... lame lame lame lame lame. i hope its just my mind fuckin with me, but she seems to be acting the same way she was when we were "actively pursuing" eachother. i know im acting the same, and it sucks because i cant stop it. FUCK!!!!!! yeah, im telling her the next time i see her. dont know what shell say, and frankly that doesnt matter right now, i just need to get this out, maybe (hopefully) itll help me. this is just so much to handle (personally, mentally) and it sucks. ill tell her, wait for a reaction and just say "aiight cool. glad i got that out."  music of  this  moment: your cell - the velvet teen. yeah, its taken me about 20 mins to write this and ive just been listening to + - = the whole time.  hmmm, this ones a little long i think.   rad.

						        urlLink    If i was a serial killer i would be    David Berkowitz  .   Originally believed to be a paranoid schizophrenic, David Berkowitz (the Son of Sam), claimed to be plagued by demons that came in the form of dogs, when the dogs would howl, that was their signal for him to kill. He said that the dogs would call out to him for blood and death, and their cry's would only stop by killing and assaulting over 6 New York women.    In a later interview Berkowitz revealed that the demon story was a conscious fabrication that he had made up to force the police into believing he was insane if he was caught. He also confessed that he would become sexually aroused when stalking his victims and would sometimes come back to the crime scenes and masturbate while envisioning his prior killings.     kill count: 6    ugh

						   music of the moment - (kickin it old skool) close to me - the cure  so i found out earlier tonight that my friend got like arrested the other night. hes a writer and apparently he was bombing with his other friend and crewmate then decided to go out by himself. and he got caught. by the cops. laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame. apparently (according to his friend) he owes at least 4000 bones. shiiiiiiiiiiiit. thats so lame. well now i guess he has something to do with that summer job  money.  yeah, i went to market by myself tonight (no dillon or ryan) and actually ran into my friend elizabeth. she was being weird elizabeth bitch chick like always all in my face saying dumb shit. whichever. shes cool. thats where i ran into my friends crewmate and learned of the shit.   hmm, not much going on in the life of shane lately, just chillin, bein bored, listening to the cure and this new postal service stuff (i love soulseek). ive gotten so into electronic music, its od, a couple months ago i wouldve fucking taken anything over techno or hXc raver shit, but its actually pretty cool.  ive found that punk is a great starter or gateway genre, it was with me at least. lets track my musical interests shall we:  7th grade  - started getting into "rock" i.e.: korn, (unfortunately) limp bizkit, sublime, slipknot. i aint ashamed of any of that.  8th grade  - somewhere between 7th and 8th i found green day, particularly the album "dookie." to this day that is still one of my favorites. gotta kick it oldschool. green day led to epitaph punk such as nofx, bad religion, us bombs, and many other generic pop-punk-esque bands. skip ahead to  freshman year ; at the end of the year in my french class a friend told me about a band called "anti-flag," thus beginning a never ending love affair with political punk. from anti-flag i got into other a-f records bands like thought crime and pipedown. i had also gotten into older political stuff - DK, subhumans, etc. pver the summer i had gone to a tsunami bomb show and i loved it. (old) tsunami bomb is rad.  10th grade  - i was now into such bands as chocking victim, leftover crack, indk, morning glory, hot snakes, and many others, i cant even name them all. i had also started getting into more "hardcore" punk like a global threat, bands of that nature. this is where i started straying from the path: along with punk, i had started getting into old rock stuff like acdc, the beatles, guns n roses, maybe thats it. i love acdc though. i had also gone to a get get go show the summer after sophmore year which sparked my love for hardcore/noise. get get go, archeopterix, blood brothers, the locust, its all good, gotta love that noise. i also got into the kindof weird indie stuff i.e. fugazi, the mars volta, and some psychobilly: tiger army, mad sin, batmobile, mad heads, nekromantix; these bands led to rockabilly, which was really found at a phenomenauts show at the phoenix that summer.   last year  - now i was well-immersed in the hardcore/noise stuff but i wasnt quite all in there yet. a friend of mine introduced me to converge the summer earlier and, shit, theyre one of my favorite bands. they led to other hXc acts such as orchid and, well, thats it i think. now that i had some  real  hXc under my belt it was time to move to the next level - the postal service? yeah, i was online and found an electronic emo band called the postal service. theyre great and they led to my emo phase: death cab, mineral, bright eyes, coldplay, capn jazz, iron and wine, mates of state. shit im emo nowadays. now with the emo came more hXc: botch, as i lay dying, circle takes the square, the black dahlia murder, and american nightmare/giveuptheghost (RIP). from the postal service came other pseudo electronic bands like the notwist, kindof half electronic. then i found amon tobin. he is the greatest. shit i love his stuff. recently its been all about the velvet teen, amon tobin,as i lay dying, the cure, the postal service, madness, and owls. see what im listening to now? emo and electronic and hardcore and ska. its all from punk. gotsta love punk and the dumb little punk kid in all of us.  fuckin shit i love music. im a fuckin music junkie, its horrible but awesome at the same time.  gotta love the rockinest most rock-steady beat of madness!!!

						   music of the moment: heavy lifting - ambulance ltd  The Flying Camel - A personal favorite. As she is lying on her back and you are hammering her from your knees, you carefully balance yourself without using your arms to prop yourself up. You then to flap your arms and let out a long, shrieking howl. Strictly a class move  The Ram - Again, you're attacking from behind, when you start ramming her head against the wall in a rhythmic motion. The force of the wall should allow for deeper penetration. Very handy for those lulls in penile sensitivity.  Dog in a Bathtub - This is the proper name for when you attempt to insert your nuts into a girl's ass. It is so named because it can be just as hard as keeping a dog in the tub while giving it a bath  Pink Glove - This frequently happens during sex when a girl is not wet enough. When you pull out to give her the money, the inside of her twat sticks to your hog. Thus, the pink glove.  The Fountain of You - While sitting on her face and having her eat your ass, jerk off like a madman. Build up as much pressure as possible before releasing, spewing like a venerable geyser all over her face, neck and tits. (Better in her bed)  The Blumpkin - You need to find a real tramp to do this right. It involves having her suck you off while you're on the shitter.  The Bismark - Another one involving oral sex. Right before you are about to spew, pull out and shoot all over her face. Follow that with a punch and smear the blood and jism together.  The Fur Ball - You're chomping away at some mighty Zena who has a mane between her legs the size of Lionel Richie's afro, when a mammoth fur ball gets lodged in your throat. You punch her.  The Chili Dog - You take a dump on the girl's chest and then titty fuck her.  The Rear Admiral - An absolute blast. When getting a chick from behind (with both partners standing), make sure you don't let her grab onto anything when she is bent over. Then, drive your hips into her backside so that the momentum pushes her forward. The goal is to push her into a wall or table, or have her trip and fall on her face. You attain the status of Admiral when you can push her around the room without crashing into anything and not using your hands to grab onto her hips.  The Snowmobile - When plugging a girl while she's on all fours, reach around and sweep out her arms so she falls on her face.  Lucky Pierre - the middle man in a three way buttfuck. Also known as the french sandwich.  Bustard- A very rude bus driver.  Cold Faithful- Blowing your visibly-steaming load outside in the winter-time, like when you get your cock sucked on a ski-lift.  Grand pappy smash- To beat your meat so hardcore that it starts to chafe and bleed.  The Flaming Amazon- This one's for all you pyromaniacs out there. When you're screwing some chick, right when your about to cum, pull out and quickly grab the nearest lighter and set her pubes on fire, then extinguish the flames with your jizz!  Old Jism Trail -The stream of semen oozing down the chin and chest of someone who has just finished fellating a senior citizen.  Anal Boot- An anal boot is when you take a pitcher of beer, everyone spits in it, someone stirs it with their cock and then the mixture is poured through the crack of a man ass into the waiting mouth of the loser of a bet or drinking game.  The Homolic Maneuver -Using your penis to dislodge an object blocking a choking victim's windpipe.  Pegging - having a female take you in the rear with a strap on.  Angry dragon - This involves the girl giving the guy head and as he is about to cum slapping the girl on the back of the head causing the cum to come out her nose. Great care should be used to not slap her mouth shut.  Tony Danza - a takeoff of the donkey punch is called the Tony Danza. When you are about to cum while doing a girl from behind, you say "who's the boss?" and stick it in her ass. Before she says anything you shout "TONY DANZA!" and punch her in the back of the head.  Alaskan firedragon - another good take off is one of the angry dragon that is called the alaskan firedragon. When a girl is giving you a blowjob, cum in her mouth unexpectedly and plug up her mouth at the same time. Then whisper in her ear "i have syphilis" so she spews it out her nose.  Upperdecking - This one takes practice. This maneuver requires a toilet with a tank above it, like the ones in most homes. Instead of crapping in the bowl, you shit in the tank (i.e. upperdecking). Now don't flush. When the following victim flushes, the rancid waste fills the bowl. If you play your cards right, it may ferment  Journey into darkness - This is the most disturbing of all. It entails shitting into another person's asshole. Not for beginners.  Rocky Balboa - dont shower for 2 weeks, then spew diarrhea down her throat at any point during sexual contact.  Rocky Balboa Title Punch - same as the Rocky Balboa, but in that non-showering 2 weeks all you eat is corn.  The McDonald's Quick Draw - Get your girlfriend to talk dirty into the intercom, making the order guy start to beat off. Then while pulling up to the window, have her give you falatio till you are about to blow your beefy chunk-load. Upon pulling up to the window, tell your girl friend to yell "Draw!". Then on "three", both you and the guy blow your loads either on her or eachother.  The Throne of Lightning - This is done by fucking a girl while you shit in a toilet. When you're going to blow your load, turn her over and dunk her head in the toilet, while she's bobbing for your turd plummet a river of semen in her ass. Not to be confused with "Ride the Lightning," a Metallica album  Abe Lincoln - You're getting a girl up the ass and give her a swift donkey punch to the back of her head, knocking her unconscious. You then turn her around and jerk off and blow your load all over her face. Then you shave her beaver and take the clippings and spread it where you jizzed on her, making a beard that looks like good ol Honest Abe's.  The Beverly Hills Whiffer -This move is restricted to those women who think they're God's gift to the world. Find a woman of the above description. Take her home and start doggie styling her. When you're about to blow, corkscrew two fingers into her ass, scraping as much shit as you can from her. Pull out your fingers, reach around her head to stick one finger in each nostril. Pull her head back so she can see you while you yell "So, you think your shit don't stink now ?!"  Shanghai Shampoo - Fuck a chick until you've built up a load large enough to paint a room. Blow it all in her hair, rub it in thoroughly. When it dries it will resemble the crunchy noodles often served with chop suey  Toboggan - when you attack from behind on your partner, push them and then ride them down the stairs like a tobaggon sled.  The Pirate Maker - When your sitting on a girls face and she's sucking on your nuts, you start poking her in the eye with your cock.  Spanish Inquisition - This is kind of like the Snowmobile. While fucking a woman in the ass, grab her arms and bring them up behind her, arching her back. Then yell, "Nobody Expects the Spanish Inquisition." For some variation, add a donkey punch.  Ali - When giving a guy a hummer, start punching his nutsack as if it were a punching bag.  The Mushroom Tattoo (aka Mushroom Welt/print) - when a chick's going down on you, you pull it out, pull it back and whip her in the forehead with it  Squeegee - when your fucking a girl in the ass, when your about to cum, you stick a pin in one of her ass cheeks, thus making her clench up and cleaning all the shit off your cock as you pull out at the same time.  Seal the Envelope - When hooking up with a really drunk girl and she passes out before you cum, turn her over and blow your load all over her ass crack. When it drys, it will seal her butt cheeks together and she will have to pry them open the next day  god, people are rediculous.....  some of these are really funny though

						   music of the moment: jenny was a friend of mine - the killers  so first off, if my posts have seemed a little "empty" lately, its because i seriously write about what is happening. so empty posts = nothing going on at all.  ive kindof managed to detatch myself from the lame highschool drama in my life, so there is part of the reason for my empty, shell-of-a-post posts. i just need to stay away from solitaire.  this made me happy though:   and    awesome. check the stuffed eagle in the first picture and the shinguards in the second.  hmmm, the oc should be good for me: spend some money, walk alone around a city ive never been to, be  away  from santa rosa for a bit. too bad (or thank god) its only for 5 days. thats all i have to look forward to in these last 26 days of summer. that and the phenomenauts show on the 28th, that is completely relying on nick  not  having anything to do that one fucking night. that always happens: we have plans to go to phenomenauts then he has to go to like a funeral or something. it sucks. ive missed seeing them like 4 times now. goddammit.   yay for school to start! structure is headed my way!
