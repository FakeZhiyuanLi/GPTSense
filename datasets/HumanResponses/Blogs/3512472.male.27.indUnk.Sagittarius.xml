      Thank you,  For the half alive loneliness I live with,  For the ignominy of being insignificant, For the prejudices I face, For the underestimation I fight, For the indifference I bear,  I thank you inspite  For, The loneliness gave me an insight into my own self, The ignominy made me find the meaning behind my existence, The prejudices made me laugh at people, The underestimation provocked me and gathered my abilities, The indifference made me stand out as a different person with an  Uniqueness to cherish.  So I thank you inspite.  Radhi

      One day I was walking alone, Looking up at trees beside, Listening to the chirps of birds,  whispers of the insects.  The fine breezing moving across was so soothing. Everything was so right, Solitude seemed a joy then.  Just then, by chance I turned back,  All those noises, that chaos, those not yet healed wounds I left behind came craving for me.  The same solitude became loneliness.  The chirps and whispers became jibes and insults.  The soothing breeze became a tempest alls et to take me into its whirlpool.  The happiness was no more,  Emptiness replaces contentment  Unable to get away all hassled I was,  Then I saw a hand waving at me  I knew this was of a person’s who would accompany me on my path to survival.  This junction I realized  I am so lucky to have you, to have met you, to realize how much I love you and now to be able to express it to you.  Maddie I love you !!!!!

      Need, you said was what leads to a relationship, Love, I said was what ignites the spark;  Love, you said arises to satiate your inner urges, Urge, I said is born only when you love a person;  You believe in no love and I think it is the ultimate truth;  Friendship, you say is non existent I say it is the most self giving association;  Things can be seen differently I conclude, What changes are the terminologies I realize;  What I define as love, You call humanity;  What I call attraction, You call it mere human tendency;  I know now it means the same when I say “I love you”  And when you say “ You are interesting”;  Let me propose something, Let’s be partners! Neither friends nor fellow human beings.  Neither in love nor detached, Neither the same nor the opposite;  Lets be two parallel lines always close by But never intersecting;  Let’s be partners, share lives Celebrating our differences!!!!

      You wake up in the dawn, find its walking towards a disastrous noon.  When you feel nothing’s going right and that everything is moving out of your sight.  When you feel every act of yours mars on your aspirations, When you find yourself in a heap of separations.  When you feel every sincere effort of yours crashes to the ground, When you everything is moving round and round.  When you feel you are developing isolation towards the world, When nothing seems to attract you not even gold.  If all these things are happening to you my dear friend, I present to you an answer to your queries, in the form of a hopeful ray Just have a cup of coffee and go to sleep the rest of the day  JRad

      Till now, through my four years in engineering from Mumbai University I thought nothing and nothing can be more absurd and unpredictable and unreliable than our examination results. But now Mumbai University’s engineering examination committee has got tough competition from the “ Election Opinion Polls-2004.”   The predictions of the exit and opinion polls of all the newsgroups and TV channels all wronged and wronged big time. Not going into the analysis of these disastrous and embarrassing results the point I wanted to make is that everyone has been taken by surprise.  I for one surely was.  Even though it was at the last minute that Dr. Manmohan Singh was sworn in as the Prime minister, it came as a pleasant surprise to all .  And even I can’t help but gleam with pride that the two persons heading our nation are both distinguished Doctors. Our president Dr Abdul Kalam Azad and our Prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh are both men of great intellect and greater sincerity and dedication. The matter of fact that they both belong to two different minority religions makes me more proud of belonging to the world’s largest democracy.  So now as an after thought I feel, we the people of nation have on our priorities the country’s well being and our welfare first over any kind of political inclinations and preferences. And it is the right attitude.  So what kind of political thought do we young people have, if any to begin with?  Actually to think about it, it doesn’t seem that bad to not have any political thought… To quote someone I read “ Happy is the nation without any political thought, for such a philosophy is generally the offspring of a recent, or the symptom of an approaching, revolution.”  I somehow feel we really aren’t very hard lined on the political parties anymore unlike our previous generations. Why is it so?   Is it because we just don’t care a damn for who heads the nation, or is it because we are not too “anti” any particular party anymore?  I say this because I feel the staunch supporters of one party are actually people whose support is a result of their hatred or disillusionment for the opposite party. They are for or against a party for the wrong reasons, not for the reasons of having the same political thought as the party they have signed up for.  Are we youngsters done with these kinds of thoughts now? Are we heading towards a no party government? Because anyway it is apparent now that we are electing people on basis of their individuality as these elections have shown that gone are the days when people voted for a party now they vote for individuals. We also may be voting for causes but there are hardly any causes presented to us.  This article of mine is to make the readers think about this alternative.  India without any political parties.  No so called secular party whose only hope to survival is to be clinging onto dynastical leadership, no hallucinating party which thinks that everything was shining and that even stars “shine” during the day, no party which is so “left” that it can’t do or think any think that is right, no self proclaimed regional parties headed by vulgarly ambitious individuals whose biggest goals are to play the king/queen maker in the after election ugly games and to be in a position to threaten and blackmail the party in the center.  Anyways we are now in the age of coalition governments, its almost unthinkable that one single party will reach the magic figure of 272 without any other associates.  Why can’t it be a possibility that we wouldn’t really be influenced by any political thought, any political ideologies, and any political debate?  Why can’t it happen that we go to elections without any political background?   Why can’t it happen that they are individuals contesting purely on their merit?   Why do even prominent and brilliant people need the shelter of political umbrellas?  Why can’t people who are brilliant and bright individuals work hands in hands towards a better government rather than wasting their energies and intellect fighting each other?  Why can’t we have a dream team of all extraordinary people in politics from all the parties on one side, all working as a single unit in the same direction towards progress, peace and well being.  Why is the need for any political polarity to be the driving force for real patriots?  Why isn’t just fervent patriotism be the catalyst enough to ignite the spark of serving the nation to the best of individual capabilities enough?   Isn’t it better to not to have any political thought rather than having the wrong one?  Lets hope that we lay to rest these question marks.   Lets hope that we too are heading towards a revolution with our disillusionment of the current political choices we have Lets hope in this revolution we together make a happy nation, a nation happy because her children are undivided over their motto of making her happy.    Thank you
