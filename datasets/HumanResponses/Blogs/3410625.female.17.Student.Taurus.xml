      sorry i didnt write yesterday.. was too hurt tht i cld not even expressed my feeligs into words.. wat happened yesterday was one of d best things he as ever done to me.. n it seems tht he enjoys doin it.. well yeah, its always my fault.. n mayb i deserve tht frm him for bein who i am.. im jealous of dilys..? where did he ever get such idedas..? i reali dunno wat is on his mind.. neither do i noe wat izit tht he wants.. everythin i do now dun seem to please him at all.. mayb its a blessing.. mayb he wld come to realise tht im not worthy of his love n wld start hatin me..n wen sch starts, he'll get to noe more girls, get close to dem n thts it.. yani wld juz be a memory to him.. oh well.. but wat abt me..? i dunno.. as much as i want to make him happy, i cant.. y..? cos as much as i want to be wif him, i cant.. theres juz somethin inside which tells me tht things wld not wrk out well bet us if we were to get into a relationship deeper den friendship.. i dun wanna lose him.. wat if we go into a relationship now.. n he finds someone new at campus..? not tht i dun trust him.. but his campus is like so freakin big n there'll be like thousands of other girls.. i mean, we still hv a long way to go.. but does anybody care or understand..? NO..! n now he even  thinks tht im askin him to find another girl. wat the fuck. i mean, like i said.. i noe tht we cant be together, for now, tht is.. but i cant let him hold on to me for d rest of his life rite.. i dun wanna be selfish.. i juz want him to hv d freedom of u noe.. gettin close to a girl n stuff like tht.. he juz doesnt noe all these.. n nvr cared to noe.. i can go on writing for hrs.. but d things he said yesterday, hurts.. alot.. so much tht til now, i cant seem to reali express it all in words.. he used to be d person who wld noe how i feel.. but now, i dun even dare to tell him.. i dun wanna go tru wat i went tru yesterday.. it reali hurts.. esp when it all comes frm HIM.. dunno wat he thinks of me now.. but i think its better if i dunno anythin rather den gettin to noe somethin, onli to end up gettin hurt.. mayb its some kind of a retribution for all d things tht i did in d past.. for breakin d hearts of people.. esp guys.. oh well...

      evrythin went fine in school today.. but not wen i got home.. wat happened at home tonight will forever remain in my memory..first up, apparently umai n rai had a fight earlier today.. umai threw her tantrum n showed her anger by ignoring my mom.. mummy was kinda upset by den.. so upset tht she let out some undesirable wrds.. told umai tht she doesnt love her anymore n tht umai is not to eat her cookin.. being young n immature, umai took mummy's wrds seriously n literally starved d whole day.. dad came back late evening n wen mummy told him wat happened, he asked umai to come dwn n hv dinner.. umai's one veri stubborn girl.. she insisted on d fact tht mummy disallow her to eat.. dad kept on forcin her to eat but to no avail.. soon after, he flared up n dragged umain to d kitchen by grabbin her hair.. stil, umai refused to eat.. afta which, dad stuffed rice into her mouth..! i freaked out wen i saw wat my dad did.. for some reason, umai still remained stubborn.. dad got hold of a broom to whack her.. thank god zul was there to stop my dad frm releasin his first swing.. while all these was happenin, mummy was at d living rm watchin tv.. guess she got more upset tht she went to umai n wanted to drag n throw her out of d house.. zul alone cld not stop mummy.. n so, fiza, dad n me tried to stop mummy.. it was like so freakin scary.. fiza den took umai away frm mummy's grip.. soon afta, mummy broke down n cried.. i cld juz feel d disappointment n sadness.. she was like "how did my daughter turn out this way? wat did i do to deserve this? she's still so young yet she cld behave in such a way?"  at tht spur of d moment, everyone else broke into tears.. including my youngest whos onli like 4 yrs old.. mummy's condition was juz so.. heartbreakin for all of us.. dad left me to console mummy while he consoled umai.. soon afta, i got umai to apologise to mummy.. even though she may hv forgiven umai, i believe tht deep inside her heart, d wound is still there.. it wld obviously take time to heal.. i dunno wat to do to help her.. wat am i to do..? best part, im hvg my gp mid yr exam tmrw n this had to happen tonight.. mayb its some kind of a test for me too.. rite now, im more worried abt ma mom den my exams tmrw.. how is she takin it..? will she blame herself for d way umai behaved..? reali hope evrythin will turn out fine afta tmrw.. she locked herself up in her room.. all i can hear was her sobbing.. thank god, dad is home tonight.. at least i noe there is always someone beside her if she ever needs a listenin ear.. now im in no mood to read up on gp.. nvm if i flunk my gp this time.. all i want now is for her to be fine..

      title explains it all.. farkin day indeed..! he hurt me wif his words again, yesterday.. and it is somehow still affecting me.. cant stop thinkin abt it. fine. was in a veri foul mood wen i turned up for dance practice. nobody dared to talk to me. haha. funny wen i think abt it though. lets get down to more serious stuff. cikgu commented on my dancing. "yani, saye tgk ur not ur usual self. awak bukan menari. drop all ur worries. concentrate on ur dance". ok. juz den, aida took my prop by accident. for some reason, i flared up like i nvr did. she, d other dancers n cikgu all stared at me for a moment. apologised to her after tht. dance class ended.  he sent me an sms. quarrelled again. shall not write wat he actuali wrote. i'd feel hurt again. for some reason, i broke down! dammit! nvr been like this before! hid it frm d others though. asked syaz for d remedy. 5 farkin sicks of it. dunno y n how i managed to consume so much. my average was like 3! wat d hell. reali lost myself. cldnt find anyone to talk to. turned to hardi instead. nvr felt any better though.  wat d fuck is wrong wif u, bitch?! this is wat YOU wanted, dammit! are u regrettin it now?! fuck it! get hold of urself! i cant! u've got wat u wanted, he's made his decision. n will no longer waste his time on a bitch like U..! am i regrettin it, NOW? i dunno. one thing i do noe though, after wat had happened to us.. after he's decided to forget me n move on.. realised how much i treasure him, how much he means to me and tht i cant lose him. since our first quarrel, keep having this feeling, this emptiness inside. oh well. doesnt matter now anyway. u stupid bitch, ur realising all these onli after he's decided to forget u. for wat?! will it change d situation, anyhow??! i noe. im juz farkin stupid i guess.  leaving for langkawi tmrw morng. dunno wen i'll be back. i'll take this time to reflect n see if i can award maself d "bitch of d yr" award. wat the hell. will miss him.

      haiz. was supposed to go shoppin wif d rest but decided not to. stayed home to revise abit. he's away on camp. didnt msg me for dunno how many days alreadi. haiz. yani! izit a must for him to msg u everyday?! he's not ur bf, is he? so wats d big fuss?! alrite. fine.  met hardi online yesterday nite. obviously they're back frm d camp. he msged me tellin me tht he's back. for some reason, felt kinda happy and relieved. msged hardi early this morning. asked him if he (alrite lets call him M) was close to any girls during d camp. y am i even askin him tht?! he has d choice to choose who to be close to him rite. i mean, i told him to forget me! wat the hell is wrong wif me? whatever. soon after, he called. my heart jumped. dun ask me why. i wont know. talked to him for a while. if onli i cld tell him how i miss him. cldnt bring maself to. cos i fuckin asked him to forget me. definitely a total screw up. wat the hell. enuf of tht i guess.  y do i feel uneasy lately? y do i keep thinkin of wat wld happen of he falls for another girl at campus, esp after camp? y do these feelings come so suddenly? i was d one who asked him to move on, n now im feelin like this. juz wat izit tht u want, bitch?! fuck it. everytime we talk, he wld mention abt me askin him to forget me. one thing he's not aware of is tht for some reason, i'd feel hurt whenever he say such thing. been thinkin abt him so much lately. has he reali decide to forget abt me, abt us? am i regrettin my own decision of askin him to forget me? u bitch! u dun even noe how u feel for him! for how long do u expect him to cling onto u, dammit!   i dunno! for now, all im hopin for is tht he wont actuali forget me. wat the fuck! first, tht was wat u wanted. n now, u want d opposite! wat do u take him for?! a plaything?!!   alrite. i've reached to a conclusion: i'm a bitch.
