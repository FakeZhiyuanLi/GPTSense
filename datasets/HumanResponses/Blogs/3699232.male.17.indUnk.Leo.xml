      Once again Im afraid Ive made the severe mistake of posting too late once Im already tired! and I have to get up early for one of those appointment things, for a college Im probably not even going to go to *sigh* oh well itll be a time killer, tomorrows college day I guess...or somethin, yea sure, why not, makes it sounds like less of a drag, eyes heaaavy, and I just ate food, so now Im wanting to just lay down and drift off, which brings another point, I need to fit God somewhere into this mess as well, which is odd because I should be working other stuff around him technically, not the other way around, hehe oh well, Im workin on it man!!! I tells ya the truth!! woooo Rebekah just asked me if my blogs going to be short tonight, Im gettin kinda freaked now, maybe she really CAN read my mind, what a frightening place, yeesh, I dont even want to read my mind =P buut anyway speaking of which I must be off now, sleep calls, curses curses, just imagine what could be accomplished if people didnt have to sleep, wouldnt that be nice? goodnight everyone!

      EDO here, hehe. Actually, the person known as EDO is about to fall asleep right before my eyes! Let's see, today, I sat on the computer for the majority and played Parasite Eve 2. Talked to the most obnoxious girl in the world for, I don't know 10 hours. Made a bet, if it's comes down to a half split, I'll get a trip to Ireland, and she'll get my playstation! I just hope it doesn't become a collectors item later on! Let's see, I don't want to sound arrogant or anything, so I'll just state what my friend thinks of me. "Eric is the most wonderful awesome person I've ever met" I could list more, but I really don't want to make my readers ill, you know.. I have enough stomach problems as it is, with being so hungry all the time. I think, I need to add a photo on my profile.. I have the perfect one too.. bwah, ha haha. I think I'm going to put something in here to decode for everyone who reads it WCREWHITVB? I need to figure out the whole HTML thing so I can add some photos in here, maybe I can use Netscape composer or Jasc? Hmm... Will try later, definitely. Let's see.. Summer SummerSummer, can't wait until College starts. That should be fun- making new friends, learning stuff, out of the house.. away from the killer online.. You know, things to look forward to and such. Had an awesome storm today, heard some of the loudest shots of thunder I've ever encountered, I believe. Stormy weather is really quite wonderful, much better than happy grass and floating fluff. You know, I should try and send sublimable messages to people... ..^^^<>//> ~`""\]+_^%@ Did you feel the power? I know you did.... This, however, was my daily loving,  hah, pfft, bah, ack, yeesh...blarg. You know, I should comprise a whole gallery of all of the funniest things I've said and take them out of context, and paste them on here one day. That, would be awesome... Okay, random thought.. did you know IE stands for id est, which is latin for 'that is'. How interesting. It's quite amazing what you can find in your dictionary.. like the fact that monosodium glutamate (MSG) is made out of CH2 NH2 and C00NA.. heh.. I will quote from my absolute favorite poet, don't you know.. I, Eric, am obsessed with poets. (famous ones anyway)  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,     While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-                   Only this, and nothing more."  Which, I suppose concludes this self conversation.. Only this, and nothing more.

      Well, I finally had to remedy that horendous typo on the title of my "Blog" or whatever, the word "ocassion" up there had been driving me nuts, and I dont want to look like an idiot afterall =) well well well, the end of yet another day, and this one better than last the pervious two for certain. My aunts been over all day and shes fun and nice to be around so thats a +, my dads visiting from California so thats another +, my sisters friend was over pretty much all day and they were being VERY loud, so thats a -...hehe, but definatly nothing awful enough to upset the rest of my good day. I also unhooked my playstation last night, as well as the game(s) Ive been obsessing over, not to mention took it apart (all the cords and controller and such) and spread each of it into a different place in my room because I know I will be too lazy to put it back togethor next time I want to play...hah, but I think (hope) its for the best, and I have been doing alot better today without video games, I seem to be more happy, however I did happen to watch 3 movies, I hope Im not exchanging one addiction for another lol, Red Dragon, Dodgeball, and just got through watching Men in Black II, and because I am bored and am looking to fill time I think Ill say what I thought about these movies too; Red Dragon = in my opinion best of its series (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal), though I really enjoyed the ending to Hannibal, and of course Silence of the Lambs is just a classic, but I liked this one quite a bit, it had a good ending too I suppose, I just enjoyed it a bit more I think, I really found the main villain in this one (no, not Hannibal, the 'Red Dragon' guy) very very interesting, I really liked watching his mind twist and turn and such. But yes, I think it was the least graphic of the 3 as well, which is a plus...Dodgeball I personally thought was absolutely hilarious, however I dont recommend it to christians or anyone thats easily offended because there were quite a few sexual jokes and some other bits of crude humor and such, I personally however am not offended by such things at the time, swearing, as well as crude humor doesnt get to me at all...yet, at least, but anyway yes I thought it was hilarious, was laughing the majority of the movie, which now that I think about it, might make it bad for others because I have a twisted sense of humor sometimes it seems, but hey thats alright, I enjoyed it all the same, might have to see it again. Men in Black II -- saw the first one a long time ago, I didnt remember the plot too well, but enough to catch what was going on for the most part, this was probably the most medicore movie of the day, I didnt see much real great about it, I thought the dog guy/alien thing or whatever was pretty funny, but other than that, nothing really phenominal about it, Ill just put it this way, I dont regret that I saw it necissarily, and Ive seen much worse, but I wont be seeing it again anytime soon, in any case it was mild entertainment for 1 hr. 30 min. - 2 hours, and in my life, entertainment in any form is usually welcome and appreciated. Anyway, we'll see how long I hold out on this anti-Playstion thing, I might cave in just yet lol, dang Parasite Eve 2 was fun, although they did change it up quite a bit, aside from the fact that the main character is the same person here, its pretty much a completely, completely different game, I mean ok, the plot does make sense, and it does play off the 1st one for the most part, so its not like they just ran with the game and made it all crazy, and the main character you play as, is the same person, although she looks alot different in this one, but the same person. Buuut as far as everything else goes, its just not the same game, different experience and leveling system, and weapon buying system (which I like so no complaints), combat system, COMPLETELY different, that the only part I might not of agreed with, thats what I loved about Parasite Eve 1, it had a very unique combat system Ive never seen anywhere except somewhat in Vagrant Story (another one of my personal favorites by the way) and basically now, what Parasite Eve 2 is, is a play off of Resident Evil, which, dont get me wrong, isnt necissarly a bad thing because Resident Evil games rock -- however in this case, I think it blows that Parasite Eve 2 completely switched over its gameplay like that, because its old system is what separated it from the pack and made it cool, fun, and unique, I mean its still not quiiite the same as a Resident Evil game, but its ALOT closer to that than it is to Parasite Eve 1, even the camera angles and everything, just totally different game, I was personally looking forward to playing Parasite Eve 2 because I thought it would encase the same gameplay which I so thourghly enjoyed but wanted more of from PE1 (because it was so short), however I was highly disappointed in that aspect, its still an awesome game, however I enjoyed Parasite Eve 1 more --- now, fellow readers of my little newfound blog thingy, some friends, some people I havent met, or will ever meet, or perhaps no one at all, you may ask, ok this fool just went on for about a page about some random game...why? well, Im bored, and I like to ramble about the things Im interested in, even if no one is around to hear them or care about them =D but just for the 1/298,321 chance someone stumbles on this page and owns a PS1  or PS2 and is bored and is thinking for something fun to do and hasnt played Parasite Eve 1, but maybe has thought about it, go rent it! its worth it, and besides, I dont know about where you live but up here in the blockbusters in Idaho they are lettin you rent PS1 games for 99 cents. So go flip up the cushions on your chouch, scrounge around under the mats in your car, dig up some change, and go get it, its fun stuff, and even PE2 if youve enjoyed Resident Evil games, and if youve never played those games...well, rent it anyway, or Resident Evil 3, awesome game, and if you only have a Gamecube, all the better, they just came out with a game that has Resident Evil 1, 2 and 3 on it, all with graphics redone and its awesome, lol ok Im done. Wow, like 94% of this blog has been random rambeling about video games and movies no one cares about...hahah look at me, sheesh, I need to get out more, make some friends, get a job, go to college, oh well whatever I do, wherever I go, whoever I meet, I think Ill be ok, I really do, I think God will watch over me...Notice, I didnt use the term "God will provide" so popular amoung christians these days, and more than likely the only person outside of myself who is ever going to read this has already heard my rant on this topic but just in case anyone else does, and because Im in a ranting sortof mood (never wouldve guessed Ill bet, huh? =P) I think Ill choose this for my next topic. Now, I dont know a whole lot about God it seems, or the Bible, but I seem to have grasped this, which some other christians havent really, its that it seems they hide behind the phrase "God will provide", its like ok, well yes, this is true, God will provide in a sense, but it doesnt mean we can do nothing, my cousin for instance, she drives me CRAAZY, shes single, with a newborn child shes currently taking care of herself however she is lazy, she doesnt go back to work to get more of the money she sooooo deseperatly needs, she wont even get her GED, so that she might have some more job opportunitys open, and she loves to hide behind all the this with the "God will Provide" theory, at times it makes me want to litereally, physically reach over and slap her and say youre nuts! The Bible, will NEVER put food in your stomach or your babie's, the Bible will NEVER put shelter over your head, and neither will Jesus or God, however! God can, and will always give you a PATH to food, no, Im sorry Brandee, he wont put the food in your mouth, chew it for you and digest it for you, no, no, no, he gives you a path to food, says ok here it is, Ive given it to you, Ive shown you the way, now come on, hop over these traps, across this bridge, through these enemys, and its waiting right here for you. And thats at the very worst, usually its much easier than that...If you sit in your house all day, and all you do is pray for food and read your Bible, and if you do nothing, and do not meet God half way, you WILL starve, the IRS or the bank or somebody WILL take your house, and your car, and all that you own will no longer be yours, particularly do to the fact you are now deceased from starvation. These are the facts of life, God is not here, he does not exist, to powder you, put you to sleep on nice fluffy clouds so that everything will be ok, this is why being a christian is hard, way harder than being anything else. Its not about your comfort, your happiness, your survival even. Now, these are things you coincidently get as well, when you follow God in most cases, and eventually, they are by no means owed to you , espeically if you dont work for them, however in following him we attain them through his mercy anyway. If, we do our half. Ok, rant over, hehehe ANYWAY, going back to the beginning of this, before I ranted and raved and lost track in all that. I am learning to trust God, last night, I humbled myself, bowed to him, and he gave me the strength to do something I didnt know was possible. He gave me the strength, to give him, my trust. No, not all of it, but enough of it to cast away my Playstation, as well as some other earthly desires I wont get into. And, that my friends, infuses me with hope, hope, that Im not doomed to live as a slave to the world forever, and that happiness may be attained, but only true happiness, through Him. I felt his spirit like Ive never felt it before in my life. I than began to think of another person in my life who doesnt feel she can trust, or be helped. Well, my friend, you know who you are, and I learned a very valuable lesson last night after a period of a ravenous 2 days which ripped me to pieces. And this I have to say to you, trust if a very special thing, some people use it foolishly, some people use it wisely, its impossible to use it foolishly with God, he wont betray you, he wont hurt you, he doesnt want you to be hurt, lonely, scared, or alone. He loves you, so much, I dont know exactly what happened in your past, but I do know this, whatever it was, it is done, it is finished, it can never be undone, it doesnt help anything to grip to the past so tightly, nor to worry about tomorrow, Im sure youve heard it said, sufficent for the day is its own troubles, so theres no need to dwell on yesterday or tomorrow...I dont think I have the exact quote right, but its somewhere around there. It was only 2 months ago I was in such a depressive downward swirl I attempted to take my own life! I hated everyone, everything, I felt no trust, no love, I was empty, full of nothing but hatred, and misguidance, which is emptyness, 2 months is not that long of a period of time, especially to recover from something that burned my soul for 4 years, but God is miraculous, and he has healed me, and tonight I do, once again, feel love, compassion, and trust. I couldnt have done that on my own, it wouldve taken me years -- if ever. Pride is a horrible thing, vanity is one of Satans favorite tools Im almost posative, with nothing else can he more quickly bring a man to his knees, for what could quicker bring anyone down than by shielding them from that which brings them up? Their source of strength and wisdom and love? Only pride does that so well. Mixed with fear, it may seem unsurmountable, and scary, I know. Ive felt both as well, you need God, I need God, without him, no one amounts to anything, give it all to him, let it go. You dont need to fear, you dont, hes there for you, he wants to help you, his hand is always extended to you, all you have to do is reach up and take it, though it may seem scary, the first step is always the hardest, thats why its all based on faith, give God your faith, trust, and love, and you wont be unrewarded or sorry you did. God loves you, I love you, and I will continue to fervently pray for you every single night. Well folks, Ive rambled, ranted, raved, and everything in between, time to put yet another day to rest once more, no need to carry it on, nothing more to say, Ill end it short and sweet...Goodnight =)

      Well todays at least starting out alot better than yesterday...no major complaints so far *knocks on wood* but yes yes, I certainly felt a much different feeling when I woke up this morning, more patience, more love, that sort of thing, however its still easy to get discouraged, and Im trying to put more time on God and less and video games...heh, those video games own me I tell ya, now theres an addiction for me worse than sex, drugs, all of em, I dont know how I could ever stop, thats what sucks to me the most about being a n00b christian so to speak, all the fun old habbits I got to build up for years and years...this one in particular for just over a decade, I dont know if I can stop, oh well I guess theres no need to worry about it too much, speaking of which, wow I love Parasite Eve 1, if thats not an awesome game, I dont know what is, perfect difficulty level, not overly hard really, but enough to keep you on your toes, the weapon upgrade/leveling system if amoung the best Ive ever seen, anywhere, and dare I say...even rivals that of Final Fantasy 7, which is saying alot, only complaint is the game was terribly short, if you knew what you were doing you could breeze through it in about 3 hours from start to finish...you shouldnt be able to do that on any game made after 1995 lol, but oh well, thats ok, its still good all the same and now Im going out to rent Parasite Eve 2 *sigh* addictions addictions, such horrible things, if humans could only keep their addictions under control this world would be such a better place, all these things that arent really bad are made bad through addiction, like with video games, I know very well thats a horrible addiction for me, and a sin because its an addiction, but wouldnt necissarily be so otherwise, maybe Ill back off a bit when college starts and I start goin to the gym again and such, and when/if I get a job, I figure if all this happens I wont have much time for them anyways. Even drugs, other than the fact that they are illegal and all, if they could be kept under control, I dont think it would even be a problem really, Im so tired of watching drugs consume people, it all happens so fast, the next time I see any one of my friends starting to do drugs, consistantly,  I think Im either going to stop talking to them entirly right then and there, or, depending on how much I value the relationship; get a job (if I dont already have one) to buy the plane ticket to where they live (since none of my friends live in Idaho) and fly to where they are (FL or CA) just to slap them out of it...lol if I have to watch one more idiot completely and utterly annihilate themselves mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and over time even physically, through drugs, Im gonna go crazy, what a bunch of trash, all because they cant keep it under control. But who am I to say anything? when it comes to addictions Im the worst...absolute worst, and Im always the guy pushing the envelope, ask any of my friends from high school or middle school, every single time, I was always the one that went too far and got in trouble...heh, thats why I know, if I ever got addicted to drugs, I would end up ODing...I just know I would, theres no question about it at all, "just one more" <---- famous last words heh, its always the just one more, just a little further, just one more step, like my crash, it was the hit that made me pass out, allright just ooonne more...*hhhuuufffff*..."ZZzzzZzZzZZZzzz"...owned, hah, every time, every time, I think Im the most addictive person on the planet, once I get a taste of something fun or cool I can never stop, ever, and always pushing to squeeze more out of whatever it is somehow or another. This makes my existance on this earth, either extremely fun, or extremely hard, in the cases Ive been living in the past, its made it extremely fun and risky and exciting, now that Ive dedicated my life back to Christ, its made it extremely hard, Im now expected by God and myself to not become hooked to these things, and actually fight the addictions I once loved and thought it was ok to plunge into daily. I now have to wage a full on war with drugs, sex, money, video games, the very same that were once my allies, friends, things I loved, and not long ago either. However, Im not complaining in the least, this is the misunderstanding most people get about me, whenever 99% of people (ESPECIALLY people my age) talk about something bad in their lives or something negative, they are trying to get people to feel sorry for them, throwing pity parties, complaining, whining, moaning I see it all to often and it makes me want to rip my hair out, drives me nuts (one of my pet peeves I guess) however I am simply not this way, now my words may on occasion come out the same as those people, but its not the same case, my life revolves around truth...truth, truth, truth, its one of the few things I take such pride in about myself, truth, Ive always been honest with myself about my surroundings, and Ive always been honest to other people...always, I tell things, as I see them, and I dont lie to myself, after Marissa cheated on me and started doing drugs, it still took me 6 months to dump her, 6 months...of hell, and what for? Because I was afraid of being alone? Afraid of being without sex and drugs? You bet. From the day she cheated on me there was no doubt in my mind we werent supposed to be togethor, and that she was only going to cause me problems and heartbreak, which she proved then and later, I forsaw all this and didnt put and end to it when I could, because I was afraid, I knew all this, I didnt try to sugarcoat the truth, telling myself "ooh well people can change, yes yes people can change, its ok, well get her off the drugs, she'll start to 'love' me again and all will be good with the word" HAH -- I pity anyone who blinds their very own eyes to the truth, that relationship was doomed far before we broke up, and I knew it, and Im not ashamed and afraid to admit that I was idiotic, afraid, and stupid, in not breaking up with her months sooner, however I paid my own prices for this ignorance and fear, that is what someone once told me, someone I repect more than many many people on this earth, someone I shared a cold garage with during an Idaho winter, he once told me -- among many other great and valuable pieces of information -- that it all comes down to price and reward. I believe that now more than ever, I truly believe a part of life can be summed up that simply, price and reward, some prices are greater for the reward you get, some rewards are greater than the price that had to be paid. And the fools in this world that I pity, are those that lavish themselves in rewards for the time at present, and seem to be ignorant enough to not look into the future and the price that will have to paid, everything has its price...Yes, even following God, I dont care what anyone says, that has a price on it, its not all reward, not even close, the prices that must be paid for following God are bieng persecuted, going through trials, and not sinning, I can take persecution alright, so that price I can live with, trials suck, but those too, I can live with, honestly, the one that gets me, the highest price so to speak for following God is not being able to sin and get away with it in my own mind, from now on, whenever I sin, I will feel guilt (and rightfully so) but all the same, I will feel it, and I cant rightfully follow God while letting myself sin, and sin is so much fun...so hard to turn away, espeically when I latched myself to it so firmly these past years. And Im having a hard time trusting God that turning away this sin will be worth it in the end, or later down the road, after what Marissa did to me, Im questioning everything anyone ever says to me anymore, how can I trust someone like God Ive only been friends with but a short while, and arent even 100% sure he exists and have no idea how he works? Wow...well I know this, I cant pull that one off right now, on my own, so hopefully (and I think he does) he will have the strength to infuse in me to do so, because by myself, I know for a fact, I cant do it. well, thatll do it for now! Ohhh I just got my first call from a college...apparently they got my SAT scores and want to show me around, weeee, lol, I feel special, well Im off to run those errands and rent Parasite Eve 2 if its in...=) =(?....=/, oh well I guess I should try not to worry about it so much as far as video games go, if my addiction cravings dont supress a little when I start to go to college and get a job...hmmm....well, Ill cross that bridge when I come to it, Im off!

      well...today sucked...just sucked. thats all there is to it heh, oh well it just seems somedays dont wanna go your way sometimes, as the sayin goes, "some days your the dog, some days your the hydrant" well I guess I was overdue for bein the hydrant lol, it was just one of those days when nothing seemed to go right from the moment I got up, everything seemed against me, which I wonder how much really was sheer coincidence and how much was due to the fact I was tired and hungry a good portion of the day, so I was irritable and it all seemed worse than it was. I guess Ill think about that one at a time Im more awake and now I dunno, I physically dont think I can be happy, Im too tired to be angry and I have nothing to be angry at outside of myself, sadness doesnt feel right cause I hate self pity, just kinda nothing, I hate this feeling =/ oh well not much I can do about it I guess except lay around and ponder, reflect on the day, try to learn something, get to sleep if Im lucky, Im off, goodnight little children of the world!

      yes yes, hooray for Mario, indeed my friends...or friend anyway, but in either case, yes, good ol Mario, ya cant beat a classic can you? thats basically what Ive been doing with my day, and other various video games, but mainly Mario...honestly, who wouldve thought that such a random game could be so fun, I want to meet the Japanese man who thought up the concept of Mario, who said he should be Italian? I mean seriously, a fat Italian plummer...thats the hero children are looking up to *sigh* oh well, hes better than most, at least Marios a happy colorful little game, even the clouds are smiling lol, though I dont know who thought up Marios enemys, first ya got Turtles, of all creatures, turtles, than Turtles that fly, then theres beetles, other turtle/reptile creatures that float in clouds and throw live spikey beetles at you, it might seem as though the games going with a reptile theme, especially seeing as how the arch villian is Bowser...a giant lizard type thing, but then the game offsets everything and promotes downright confusion with...angry mushrooms, honestly, who thought of the idea of an enemy to be a mushroom crawling around with an angry face, I mean wow, and personally for me, being a Mario veteran, to say the least I do believe Im disgraced in the fact that the only thing I have to do is run through the game and not touch anything or fall down any holes, yet I die so often, makes me feel weak hah, espeically when I make the same mistake 2 or 3 times in a row...like just now (yes Im playing right now), wow I just did it again, ok yea offical 3 times then, that was ridiculous, I need to learn to learn from my mistakes, ooohhh well, enough Mario for now, but I have nothing else to talk about! what a pity, it must be such a boring life I lead, oh oh oh! and yea tomorrow I get the pleasure of driving my grandparents home which should be fun, except for the fact that I have to spend the night over there, meaning it may very well be the first night since Ive met Rebekah that we havent talked to each other *cry* what a horrible thing, no no I musnt break the rally weve got going now, Ill have to think of something besides, if I didnt talk to her for a day, something just wouldnt...feel right, though the poor things no doubt getting sick of me by now, oh yea, Id say shes about ready to put a pitchfork in my neck by now, but hey thats alright! curses...I cant seem to get by level 7-2 , what a shame and pity all at the same time...well thatll about do it for me for today! goodbye, uhhh myself!

      indeed it is true, curse the summertime, argh, Im dying its so hot, the only relief I have is laying on the floor which appears to help and goes along withg that oh so helpful scinece thingy I leanrd a while a back in which heat rises, annyway, so I am typing most of this from the floor and some of it with my eyes closed because Im so tired so Im sorry in advance in there are alot of typos =/so then as they say...on to business, lets see here, what to say what to say, ya klnow the pat few days have been just really weird, thats all there is to it, it just seems like Im jacking up so much lately in everything I do I just dont get it, the only thing I seem to excell in these days is Mario Kart...and thats not saying much, lol, no mattter how much I learn or grow to love other people I just cant seem to stop hateing myself, I just cant figure out why, it seems like I just hate myself for everything and I feel responsible for everything bad that happens around me. Even stuff I clearly had no part in I feel bad for and feel like I should punish myself for it....well, sometimes at least, depends on my mood really, Im just so scared is all, Im scared for myself but moreso for my friend, I fear for her very muchb everyday, I think that might be why Ive been playing video games so much lately, Im getting even more afraid of reality and if I will be able to face it... the poor thing, its not her fault I just have a hard time reading her sometimes and it feels so much like she is always hiding her whole life from me, if it werent for these blogs I might have no idea she was sad or confused or whatever at all, is she scared of me, is she just afraid too or is it just her nature to not talk about things like that or what? I just dont know.....I wish I could do more, I wish I were stronger, the truth is...Im not, maybe if deep inside I was stronger, nicer, more patient, I could help her more, and help myself more, I dunno, all I really feel right now is that Im nothing compared to her, I really just feel so weak and foolish and stupid even comparing myself ti her, the wat her words flow, her selflessness, the things that she does and says, the way she writes, the way she thinks, the way she loves to stand in the rain, the way she is so loving and nice and strong at the same time, oohhh God I could go on for days, its all just so...I dont even know, the only thing I know is I cant amount to it, or at least thats how I feel. But that doesnt bother me much really, I just cant stand to see her in pain, I hate myself so much for not loving her as much as I could, or should,she deserves all the love in the world, and because of that alone it makes me want take away any pain or confusion she would ever have and put it into me...scary thing is, I think I actually mean that. today has been a confusing day to say the least, many mixed emotions and most of it I jsut tried to cover with endless AC and mario Kart, but I know for a fact that in my heart whwn I dig past all that, dig past all the video games, and depression, and confusion...I love herm and I dont know how Ill feel tomorrow or the day after but I do know that at this moment, I feel as though I would give my life for her, just for her to be happy. Im just so scared that shes going to drift from me for some reason, or that Ill scare her away&nbsp;or worst of all, that I wont be good enough...I hope neither is true, I think Ill take a day off of AC and Mario Kart tomorrow, give my mind some clearance, get some of that junk out of there, perhaps that will help. *sigh* shes so wonderful, I hope somewhere in her heart she realizes that

      HAH, scared ya didnt I? I know Im a sneaky one, you always gotta watch me, well Ive been bein a lazy fool and not posting lately =) =/ =P so I figured I better catch myself up a bit do some postage, afterall I do have plenty to talk about over the last couple of days, they have been quite adventerous really (ok ok boring for 99% of peoples standards but exciting for me!) I guess Ive overall been the same lazy, forgetful fool...speaking of which, I forgot about my laundry! brb ... ... ... ook then, annnyway what exciting news do I have...well Im not sure if I recently posted this or not but Im posting it now because Im still angered about it!!! my SNES isnt working anymore, the power cord failed, and do you know what that means?? NO MORE MARIO *sobs* Im so so sad, and Ive searched seriously about 15 game stores for an SNES power cord and not ONE had one, and about 5 of them gave me a little talk about how rare they were I was like ooh gee, thanks, thats encouraging, so Ive had to resort to some other playstation games, hooray, its actually been a pretty good few days, one of the days in particular stands out in my mind it was yesterday I think? Maybe the day before, but it was just such a stupid day and I was so pissed lol from the second I woke up I could just sense it wasnt going to be a good day, and then the first thing I do after I come out of the shower is go to my computer as always and w00t the keyboard isnt working, and by shaking it and tipping it upside down out of anger I couldnt help but notice the water pour out...by then I knew the problem pretty immediatley, and then I was forced to try and set up one of those cursed cordless keyboards aghhh, HATE, hate, hate cordless computer equipment, maybe its just me and getting all intimidated by them, I dont know, but wow do I ever have a hard time with them, its so ridiculous, and it didnt have enough batterys so I had to search the house for batteries, couldnt find any, found about 3456789 AAA batteries but I needed AA, I eventually had to steal from some remotes to get it =D, and THEN I relalized if I was going to use the cordless keyboard it wouldnt work without its partner cordless mouse just because it was gay like that so I tried to hook that in and the mouse was broken, it was so lame, it worked fine if you kept the cursor moving, but once you stopped moving the cursor, in about 5 seconds it froze and wouldnt start again, and I never did get the keyboard to work so I was like OK screw this, moving on to keyboard number two and hooking back in my cord mouse, at which point I ran into an entirely new problem, apparently keyboard number two requires 4 batteries instead of 2 foooor whatever reason, I preceeded to rape a few more old TV controllers and I was on my way yet again, at which point when I was trying to install this frustrating piece of technological junk I came across an error message that struck my funny bone, all the sudden the whole screen went black and there was that white lettering, that looks like a dos program, ya know the black screen you never want to see an error message on? yea, that one, and it said  Keyboard Failure: Please press F1 to continue, or F2 to enter setup. " ...... " I then had to restart the computer the mean way and eventually got it working, yay! then I was simply not happy for the rest of the day, so I decided to go see Spiderman 2, which wouldve been cool if I was late and didnt miss it, annnnd despite the fact there were about 567899876 showings of the movie that day, another one didnt start for another hour, but Anchorman started in 15 min so I thought to myself ook thatll work, and Im glad I saw it, it was pretty funny, one of the most random movies Ive ever seen at some parts, depends alot on your sense of humor, I think, I enjoyed it, I thought there were some really funny parts, but even Ill admit some parts were just flat out stupid, its like they took a low class joke and just tried to run a mile with it, there were 1 or 2 sceens I was just thinking to myself "ook now its just gone too far, this is gay, when is this going to end?" but oh well, it entertained me and took me from the real world for 2 hours, which is all I really needed, however I dont think Id see it again, oncell do it for me. Anyway, though that was a terrible day, it ended absolutely magnificently, and the only person reading this should know why, once again I didnt know I could be happy after such a day but there ya go! and I think that was all the day before yesterday...yes, yes that sounds right because yesterday was much better, I was rather happy throughout the day really, watched Pirates of the Caribbean again, (I think I might as well go for a record for most consecutive days watching at least 1 movie) I really liked that movie for some reason, honestly Ive seen it about 3 times and Ill still trying to figure out why though *shrugs* but thats about it really for the chunk of my day, well and I was trying to figure out this one question my friend asked me which was something along the lines of...how do you tell if you just love someone or are in love with them? Ive been contemplateing this, I think Im getting closer and closer to the answer, actually I think I have the answer in my mind as of now the main problem would be just throwing it down on paper, and speaking of which...lol, forgive me my dear dear friend but Im afraid Im meerly a no talent fraud, that poem was not made by my hand Im afraid =*(, I wish I could write something that awesome, and that was cool like that, truth be told it was from a song that I tweaked, I just took out some of the other parts and the chorus, as well as the proper respects to whom wrote it simply because there wasnt enough room in the profile, and besides, I tweaked it so badly it was probably half my work, half his =0, in either case, I didnt create the words, and yes I know Im a a horrible swine, however there was reason for me hacking that song to bits and putting it in my profile at that moment, it wasnt just a cool song that I felt like stealing right then, oh no, you see, last night was different, last night was something interesting, I just felt so happy, and you seemed so happy it made me happy, and I know Im awful with words and if I tried to create something out of my own mind it would just end up sounding like crap, and I happened to be listening to my playlist at the time and that song came up, and it inspired me I guess you could say, and I thought the whole song, but chorus in particular, couldnt have more accuratley reflected how I feel everynight, and that night especially, and though the words seemed so simple, my own personal words couldnt have amounted to them, I wouldve overthought it too much...However, here is that song in all its original glory and its entirety:  There are no unlockable doors, There are no unwinable wars, There are no unrightable wrongs or unsingable songs, There are no unbeatable odds, There are no believable Gods, There are no unnameable names,  Shall I say it again? Yeah... There are no impossible dreams, There are no invisible seams,  Each night when the day is through, I know this much, I just want you. I just want you. There are no uncriminal crimes, There are no unrhymeable rhymes, There are no identical twins or forgiveable sins, There are no incureable ills, There are no unkillable thrills, One thing, and you know that its true, I don't ask much, I just want you. I just want you. I just want you. I just want you. Im sick n' tired of bein sick n' tired, I used to go to bed so high and wired, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I think I'll buy myself some plastic water, I guess I should've married Lennon's daughter, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah There are no unachievable goals, There are no unsaveable souls, No legitimate Kings or Queens, do you know what I mean? Yeah... There are no indesputible truths, And there ain't no fountain of youth, Each night when the day is through, I know this much, I just want you. I just want you. I just want you. I just want you. I just want you. I just want you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just want you. I just want you. Hey, yeah, I just want you. Yeah, yeah, yeah I just want you. Hey, I just want you. I just want you. I just want you.  There ya go, I know Im a bastard, at least Im an honest bastard though, I couldnt write something like that if my life depended on it, but even if the words didnt come straight from me, it doesnt mean they lost any meaning. Anyway well Ive had enough of sounding like an idiot for a while =/ Im off, have a great day, and sorry again =(

      not sure what else to title this one, Im afraid Im running out of titles it seems, but Ive eaten about 3 hot pockets today so I guess thats a fitting title, I really do love those things, good food and the best part is Im able to enjoy them about 3 minutes from the thought crossing my mind, and that includes taking it out of the wrapper and getting it ready and all, which sounds like a good deal to me! perhaps I let my impatiece get the better of me too often =P, oh and I watched a movie...Timeline, very interesting movie, Id say I liked the history aspect of it better than most anything else, Im very intrigued with the whole Eupoean Medieval era, Id like to study it, and it sure did make me want to play my Medieval war game on the comptuer, but Im too restrained by AC Im afraid, as well as my happy little Samurai game on PS1, ahhh fun fun, so much fun so little time, and I had a great night last night as well, so overall things are goin pretty good, and I had to fight myself to get out of bed thismorning for church...unfortunalty the lazy side of me won that battle =P oh well, next week, next week...even though thats exactly what I said last week and the week before that as well, but this time, Im serious =D, kinda, thats it for now!

      Dont even know what to say except for that, what an incredible feeling, to feel such love, such contentment, I almost fear saying anything at all, afraid it might ruin it somehow, Im just so happy, and words cant express how glad I am that both God and my friend have entered my life, I love you both so much. You mean everything to me. Thats all for tonight

      hey hey, just woke up this morning, not much else to say really, just startin off my day with a breakfast burrito and some orange juice, hooray, and in case youre wondering about the title, no it has nothing to do with this post whatsoever, its just a name on saw on CS a while back, I got a kick out of it, God knows why =P, well I guess its time to play a little AC, about half way to 91...DANG its startin to take too long to level, and my character being gimp and all til my timer runs out for the spec quest makes things tough...takes me like 4-5 hours of solid hunting to gain 1 level as it is right now, brutal I tell you, brutal. Oh well, Rome wasnt built in a day (I wasnt around at the time, but thats what I hear), time to rip up those wasps and play a little Bushido Blade 2, ahhhh, I cant think of a better way to start out the day, thats for sure =)

      Post time! wee! even though its 1:21 I dont feel that tired but I feel it comin up on me so its hard to tell just how long this is gonna be, but if nothin else its gonna be fun! w00t! well lets see what did I do today, I cleaned! thats right...no, my blog didnt get hacked, its me Eric, and I cleaned today, for like 6 hours, completey cleaned and organized my room, and now the furniture is placed rather awkwardly however in my opinion uniquely and comfortably, which works out quite well for me, I cleaned my room, my bathroom, did all my laundry, cleaned my computer area, and oraganized everything nicley, how long will it last? *shurgs* my guess is, if isnt all back to the way it was in under 3 days, it should last for a while, Im hopeing for the latter, but we'll see, and oh yes and I vacuumed the ENTIRE house, and it wasnt til the last room I realized the vacuum was on blow instead of suck, so basically I went around the entire house blowing dirt everywhere *sigh*, what kind of vacuum has a friggin blow setting anyway? honestly? lol, oh well, its all good, the exercise did not go unappreciated, on another upside I got a VERY good deal on an armor top today on AC...and I just have to tell someone, so I might as well tell myself, heeeere we go!  ************************************************************************************BEGIN BORING AC SECTION THAT NO ONE WANTS TO READ, SPARE YOURSELF THE BOREDOM, SKIP THIS, IT WILL BE FOUND UNINTERESTING AND AS PURE JIBBERISH TO ANYONE THAT HAS NOT PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE...YOUVE BEEN WARNED ************************************************************************************   I bought a base AL 391 PREEE PATCH, thats right, PP style, Amuli top, WK 4, tinked 10x, which is frrriiigggin uber! for only...2 bags of steel and 1 bag of sunstone, and seeing as how if it werent fully tinked out it wouldve cost me 10 bags of steel, not to mention the top itself since its good, and PP is worth an unholy ton, I got a sickeningly good deal to say least,that thing shouldve cost me about 5x what it did heheheheh *evil grin* in all honesty, I dont think the guy knew what he was giving up, I almost felt bad buying it from him at such a low price, so I gave him a mod 130 bow wk 4 at a discounted price to even things about it =P, and I evened myself out by letting this fool rip me off while trying to buy leggings to match...lol, its hilarious when I think about it, I paid 3 bags of SS and 2 Aqua for those leggs, so I paid about double what I did for that top...and the top is in reality worth about 4-6 times more than those leggings, hah, what a coincidence, so I guess it all came close to evening out since I took such a dive on those leggs, but all the same, I got a good deal overall, and now with a few dye plants to get the color perfect and some more steel, Ill have myself another spiffy armor suit to sport around! hooray hooray, brown trim on both =/ not my favorite color, but hey when someone practically throws such an incredible top in your lap, well let me put it this way...beggars cant be choosers =), thinkin about dying the main part of them dark green, so were gonna have brown on dark green, in other words Im gonna try to pull it into an army/camoflauge kinda look, we'll see how close I actually land, heh, what else matches with BROWN anyway? maybe red I guess...but Ive already made 2 suits with red in them, need to shake it up a bit, black or white might look ok...well Im goin with my camo thing, and if it ends up looking like crap Ill go from there =P, man I could talk to myself about this game for hours, but Ill stop myself before I drive that certain other person I care about whos no doubt reading this absolutely insane, because theres no doubt in my mind she didnt pay heed to my disclaimer, yet it proved true, didnt it? =P well I like to think of myself as a man of mercy sooooo....  ************************************************************************************ END BORING AC SECTION ************************************************************************************  oohh I like this song...this is the ONLY, repeat, only country song Ive ever heard and enjoyed, my friend from CA liked it and him took him weeks just to convince me to listen to it lol, but its awesome...Garth Brooks baby, OH yea, heheh, "The Thunder Rolls" if anyone cares to listen, only get the long version by the way...the songs just no good without the last verse, maybe I just like it so much because I can relate to it in a way... heeeh heeh, if you listen to the lyrics youll see what I mean, lovely song, just lovely, but still not one of my favorites, Im afraid I like some others better, particularly that one song by Neil Young, "Old Man", I love that song (wonder how many current teenagers in the world would like that song -- Ill bet about as many as I can count on 2 hands) but its a cool song, too short though =*( but eh..whaddya gonna do, either way, its one of the only songs in existance Ill put on repeat 5+ times and not get sick of, the only other songs I can even think of Ill do that with are "Dont Fear the Reaper" by Blue Oyster Cult, and "Stairway to Heaven" ORIGINAL version by Led Zepplin, I cant even count how many fags have redone that song trying to be cool though, blarg, thats really about it, and I dont have Dont Fear the Reaper downloaded on this computer, curses, curses, oh well thats ok, depressing song anyway, sad ending =( but sometimes those are nice, depending on the mood, thats what I love about all 3 of those songs though, they are all mellow for the most part, yet just kinda inbetween and easygoing it seems like, so they are easy to listen to in any mood, its kinda cool, I might have to rethink my sleeping schedule tonight after some mental debate with myself...Ive thought, why does it REALLY matter right now if I get up early or not? what am I getting up for? oh thats right, nothing. So I might have to rethink that one. Well, lets see, I dont have much else to say I guess, all Ive pretty much done is rambled across 2 topics afterall, anyhow that thing issss to my dear dear friend, yoouu know whom you are, well I dont know if you will read this tonight before you go to sleep or in the morning, if its in the morning, hope you are feeling better, and good morning and have a good day! if its tonight still, I just want ya to know that you didnt upset or anything and that its fine, and I can understand that mood because I know it ALL TOO WELL. Being just annoyed and frustrated and pissed with yourself is a bad mood, it sucks, all I can really tell ya is to hang in there, be as strong as ya can, and itll pass, Im sure the mood youre in is not without reason, even if you cant understand the reason, God loves ya, hes watching out for you, and so am I, be well and think happy thoughts, Ill be prayin for you tonight as with every night, you have a great nights sleep and a good day tomorrow and I will see ya when I see ya! hope you feel better =*(, goodbye/night

      Its amazing how you can start one day and go through that day all the same way yet end it so differently, this whole day Ive been depressed and annoyed with everyone...just one of those days where I just wanted to sit there and do nothing but be lazy and get lost in TV all day (hence the watching of 3&1/2 movies) not to mention I was about to kill my mom, man she was on a total emotional rampage today, it wasnt cool, but I guess not her fault, in a sense, just kinda had an overall crappy kinda day, just felt empty, energyless, junky, etc, on the upside I did hit level 90 on AC...YAY, but it wasnt enough to offset everything else heh. then I got online one last time to see the person I was looking for not there, I was like well perfect end to a perfect day I guess, and right before I left she got on, Ive been talking to her for the past 2 hours or so, and I dont know what all happened and what all was said in those 2 hours, but I can tell you this, I went from sad, depressed, and tired to content, what a blessing, no, what a friggin miracle, I would never have guessed I could end such a day this happily, to think that not 2 hours ago I was feeling so lonely and the world seemed so dark, such a sad place, and now, well, now, the worlds a beautiful place once again, thanks to a very beautiful person, and a very beautiful God. How lovely, how precious, how awesome, tonight I get to fall asleep with a smile on my face, not unlike the smile on my face at this very moment, thank you so very much yeeet AGAIN for helping me, though this time Im not even sure you were aware of it, but thank you for the times you were as well, you mean the world to me, and I could write a 10,000 word post on you and how much you mean to me, and how I see you, but Im far too tired, so I guess thatll about do it for now, goodnight!

      Sometimes you have to step back from the world and say "wow". And today I did just that, and all I could seem to think of to say was..."wow, what a bunch of fucking idiots." Thats right, YOU are a fucking idiot. I dont know who you are (as in reading this post), I dont know who all will ever read it, but whoever does, and self included, you are without a doubt a complete and utter dolt, because thats what everyone is. I personally took a look at "idiot" in a thesaurus and got a complete list of what I believe to be accurate names to describe the human race: ass, birdbrain, blockhead, bonehead, boob, bore, buffoon, butt, chump, clod, clown, cretin, dimwit, dolt, donkey, dope, dork, dumb ox, dunce, dunderhead, dupe, easy mark, fair game, fall guy, fathead, goat, gomeral, gomeril, goose, halfwit, idiot, ignoramus, illiterate, imbecile, innocent, jackass, jerk, lamebrain, laughing stock, lightweight, loon, lunkhead, meathead, moron, nerd, nincompoop, ninny, nitwit, numskull, oaf, omadawn, ownshook, pushover, sap, schlemiel, silly, simpleton, stooge, sucker, turkey, twerp, twit, victim. -- And every one true Im sure, because thats what you all are, a bunch of idiots. I dont give a shit what you own or how you got what you own, I dont give a flying fuck about your IQ, your grades, your character on an online game, your report, your credentials, your vocabulary, what you THINK is your intelligence level, how strong you are, how intelectual you are, how cute and funny you are. Youre a fucking moron. And so am I, now why the hell, would I listen to the opinions of idiots? It doesnt make much sense to me now that I think about it. Do you cretins and pricks actually believe for a damn second anything you value in this life or anything of this life means anything? Why be depressed? whats the point? whats it DO for you? I asked myself this today I thought ok now, bad things happen to me in my life, for example, when Marissa cheated on me, ok, this depressed me very badly...Why? What good is that feeling? What good does it do me??? Ok let me think about what good influences depression gives me that would make me choose to dwell in it, ok, 1)... .... .... oh yea theres NOTHING, its a feeling people created so they could feel sorry for themselves, used by cowards and by the weak, to make themselves more fearful and weak so they dont have to face their problems. I dont care what your situation is, I dont care if someone slaughtered your whole family and raped your wife, or stole 3$ outta your wallet, theres no need for it, it doesnt do anything for you but bad, so WHY THE FUCK DOES EEEVERYONE (self included!!) do it?! I mean what the hell, is it really that hard for people to see past their own hand in front of their face? I guess so. I finally understand why I hate everyone so much, I FINALLY GET IT, this may sound like a pissed post but Ive never been more enlightened, Ive FINALLY FINALLY discovered why it is I am so severly severly annoyed with EVERYONE, including myself!!! its not because I have hatred in my heart, its not because of liars or cheaters (though I hate them too, but that ties into this also). Unfortunalty...though I shouldnt say unfortunatly because God no doubt made me this way for a reason, and honestly now that I think about it, Im damn proud of it, no matter how much it may suck...The reason I 'hate' people, the reason Im annoyed with every single one of you bastards (Ill note once AGAIN just to ensure I dont get any bullshit from people, Im also reffering to myself, so STFU already =P)...is beccause Im simply annoyed by weakness. And no, Im not talking about physical weakness, cripples and gimps, Im talking about mental weakness, and every one of you mother fuckers is absolutely, posativly drenched in it, whether you like it or not, and from weakness, sprouts ignorance. You all need SOMETHING dont you? I know you do, and Im not even talking about food and air and water, Im talking about mentally, emotionally, you all NEED something...is it something you need in order to survive? No. Its something you tell yourself you 'need' in order to survive, but instead its meerly a comfort you weak little bastards dont want to live without, whatever it is. And you rely on it so much, and let it fuel your weakness it comes to a time when in a certain essence, you DO end up needing it, because humans are weak, we cant survive on our own. I dont care what you think. You cant. This has been one of the most profitable days of my entire life, because Ive learned, I cant rely on anyone...ever, because people are stupid, weak, stupid, ignorant, weak, dumb, lame, and stupid...and weak. (and YES Im aware I said weak and stupid 3 times for your politically correct close minded bastards who cant read between the lines.) Now the actual POINT of all this...Ive been trying to rely on people, fix them, fix their weaknesses, base my life upon it in hopes I can rely on them. Well youre all mental gimps, and it wont work. People are stupid, and they make mistakes everyday, and more than once too, so do animals, flora and fauna die and wither to dust every single day, emotions, people, everything on this Earth will, in time, be no more, decayed, gone, forever, nothing in existance lasts all eternity, except that which goes unseen by eyes of men. God, lasts, forever, he doesnt screw up, he wont make mistakes, hes not going to decay, your items, the physical things of this world, your depression, your sad story, your pride, your ignorance, your weakness, do you actually believe for a damn second he is blind to these things? What the hell are you trying to prove? Trying to prove that your something special to 10 billion other fellow idiots out there? Well hey, have fun with that, and you have your reward, however Im sorry to tell you that your reward, whatever it is, on this physical earth, will be absolutely annihilated. So then, you are trying to prove your worth to God through these things? Youre not going to tweak Gods feelings, youre not going to get him to feel sorry for you through your own works or how your life has been, so please, fellow idiots, (and I for one, hope I never forget this). Dont mess with God. Its really that simple, if I could compare your intelligence to his I would put it at about a 1/2,456,345,789,876 scale. So then what makes you think you can manipulate his feelings and get him to do what you want? Were all stupid, you cant help that, and God knows this, this is why he shows pity on us, and mercy, not because weve earned any cent of it, we havent earned anything. If any one of you so much as thinks for a moment youre any holier, better, or more divine than the trash outside on the curb, your mistaken, you are a sinning, blackened, unpure, piece of moral dogshit. Only through God, and his amounts of mercy, grave and power that are so incredibly massive we cant even comprehend them, do we amount to anything even a sliver higher than that. Therefore, my friends, or just anyone who is reading this...Do not fear, do not be sad, do not be upset, do not be depressed, do not feel sorry for yourself, youve no reason to, because God is real, and lucky for you, hes a good God, not an evil one, and he loves you, he loves you so much, whenever I try to think about it, it absolutely blows my mind, and I know Im only comprehending about 1/1,000,000,000th of it, THATS just how simple and weak our minds are, and how incredibly powerful he is. So then, with this in mind, tell me, what right have you to worry? or be sad? or fearful? Honestly, how dare you, its like spiting in his face.-(ONE last time for the extremely slow and forgettful person, when I say "you" I am referring to the human race as a whole, INCLUDING the member of the human race that is typing this, Im only typing this for my own benefit based on what I have learned, Im simply talking to myself)- you have no right to do that. Listen, you are weak, you are a simpleton, depression will get you nowhere except fueling your already overflowing weakness, which is the cause of all your problems in the first place, this is one of Satans tools, dont you get it? He wants you to be weak, who is easier for the lion to pounce on and devour I ask you, a zebra? or a zebra with a gimped leg? He wants you weak, youre easier to slaughter that way, so what is your defense against weakness? already being so incredibly weak? The only thing that isnt weak, God. Were all weak, but Im afraid thats just the cards we were delt, but God knows this, and he has shown pity upon you, so Im afraid all you can do with those cards is accept that you are, indeed, weak, and stupid, and try to be the best you can be reguardless, and draw strength, wisdom, courage, and power, from the one and only source that can be found in existance. If you dont do this, you might as well go ahead and lay down in front of the lion's den, because without God's love, all is lost, and it is quite impossible to evade the lion, no matter how tough you THINK you are....... What a beautiful day, Godbless it, and Godbless you, whoever you are, bye for now, and I hope Ive made your existance on this insane Earth a bit easier.

      well, that sums it up for now...family, and a heavy dose of it, wow what a couple of days, one of those times where Im lazy, exhausted, and just flat out tired in every way, I wish to do nothing more atm than envelope myself in a mass of video games and food before I take a shower, pray, and go to bed, and I intend to do as such, I really dont feel like talking to anyone right now (in the physical realm at least) due to the fact that Ive been absorbed in more people and exercise in the past 48 hours than in the past 3 months combined, not to mention all that other complete BS going on (read earlier post) but anyway, Rebekah if youre reading this, sorry I havent been able to talk to you much lately, I just wanna relax for a bit, but I may or may not get on later, so yea if your on Ill talk to you, and if you arent well...you arent. heh, thats it for now, goodnight

GO...FUCK....YOUR...SELF. Im sick of you, Im sick of people, Im sick of God, Im sick of Satan, Im sick of life. and this fucking shit....god...damn. and I know for a fucking fact that people I know who read this will abandon me, WELL GO A-FUCKING-HEAD, NOW you know how I really feel inside, tainted by Satan, tainted by darkness, tainted by evil. My family would FUCKING SHUN ME IF THEY KNEW THIS, Im not even FUCKING kidding, and they call themselves christians, I SPIT on all of them, FUCK them all, fuck em, oh, oh whats that mom? cousin? uncle? aunt? you think I fell asleep at the wheel? wrecked up the car a bit right? oh well it happens, its ok huh?

THIS will be interesting, lets see how many people hang around me after they read THIS...my guess? NONE. You all know nothing about me. Want to know the real Eric? The REAL Eric has tried to kill himself. The REAL Eric has been depressed out of his FUCKING MIND EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY since middle school. The REAL Eric swears. The REAL Eric has worshipped Satan. The REAL Eric IS STILL SOMETIMES AFRAID OF THE MOTHER FUCKING DARK BECAUSE HE USED TO FEEL DEMONS SURROUNDING HIM EVERY FUCKING NIGHT. The REAL Eric cant trust anyone. The REAL Eric has an insatiable hatred in him for humanity...but no matter how much he hates the world, he hates himself even more. The REAL Eric has scars all over his body from where hes sliced himself open with saw toothed blades and hunting knives (ever notice that scar on the back of my hand? accident? BULLSHIT). The REAL Eric has lost but all hope in himself, and his life. Then, theres Eric #2, quiet, calm, nice, loving, laughing. Which is the real one? I DONT EVEN FUCKING KNOW ANYMORE, SO IF YOU DO -- PLEASE LET ME IN ON IT. Now, why am I doing this? Because, Ive fucking had enough, I dont fucking care any fucking more. WHERE THE FUCK IS MY HELP YOU BASTARDS, WHERE THE FUCK IS IT???, ALLL OF YOU GODDAMN PRICKS, ALL those times Ive listened, given you love, and compassion, in a time of need, WHERES MINE. Whos been there for me 99/100 times when Ive cried? beat myself up? been depressed? cut myself? fuuck this, so there you are, Im a bipolar piece of emotional shit, Im the weakest person I know mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, and I fucking hate everything, I dont even care anymore, and its a good thing too because Im sending this out to the people I know, they at least should know the truth, and I will be surprised as fuck if they dont abandon me. I sabotage myself all the time, why? fuck if I know, maybe Im insane, either way, I hate myself, and I know for a fact if I died tonight only a handful of people would care, and of those people, if they read this note, it bring the number down to fewer people than I can count on one hand...goddamnit, fuck this, I hate myself so much...fuck. Rebekah, Im....Im just so sorry, I love you, just please forgive me

      Well well well, Ive been slacking on this the past 4 days or so, so I suppose its about time to make up for it now with a really long one! bwahaha, actually I dont know, I just dont feel tired tonight and it seems like I have alot to say, since I have about 4 days or so to talk about, well lets see, where to begin, its been an interesting couple of days, and Im really sad to say just how much my life has been twisting around video games, its getting flat out sad in all honesty *sigh* college will come soon, college will come soon...But not soon enough curse it! I still have to wait til Sept., only then can I finally get something solid into my days, other than AC, wow I love that game, what a drug, honestly...heroine? crack? shrooms? that stuffs for sissys, ACs the master drug lol, I cant quit that thing for the life of me. Everytime I quit, say Im done, some time later, whether it be days, weeks, or months, I allllways come crawling back hehehe, and such was the case with a few days ago, yesterday I actually think as a matter of fact, I started gettin into it again, I started off yesterday afternoon barley at lvl 86...and now Im half way from 89-90, now people that do play AC can look at that and realize Ive been playing like a cow, and people that dont play AC well firstly, you should, and secondly, youll just have to take my word for it =P, but thats a good 16-20 hours of play, in two days, curses, I think its started to own my life again, oh well Im allowed some fun for the next few months or so until September, at which point I fear my fun levels will be axed severly. But thats ok, Ive been ODing on fun levels for far too long anyway...since about 6th grade I believe! w00t w00t, alas the real world comes in all its fury, and I cant wait!Im sick of this crap, truly truly, ya know what else Im sick of?? can ya guess?......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................? still havent guessed? PEOPLE, argh, I swear, wow, this is bad, I dont think Im supposed to hate my own race or species or whatever this much, lol, but yea, wow people, I think Im just a bitter human being in general, which is odd, because I seem to be nice to people, overly nice in some cases, but I guess I can be a jerk at times too, geez I dont know, Ive just been feeling extremely bitter lately, maybe its because of , oh I dont even know anymore, and if I shouldve learned one thing about myself by now, it should be self-analization never really works, I wonder if there is actually anyone out there that wouldnt bother me in some shape or form, I highly doubt it, I would find something, heh, I always do, w00t w00t, so lets seeeee, oh yea and I just have to ramble to someone, OK I cannot see the ending to my beloved PE2 game and I MUST watch before I take it back, if I dont by tonight I have to take it back anyway, and basically Im going to be very, very enraged if I do because that would mean I wasted like 13 hours, not to mention 3 days of late fees, for nothing, all on a 99 cent game lol, it would only take me 20 minutes really....30 tops, WIIIITHOUT innnnterupptions being the key thing, meaning I must do it when everyones asleep yet Im not too tired, so around now, but now Im busy doing THIIIS *glares at screen* lol, nah this is cool though, more time killin, Ill probably just be up late tonight, w00 w00, and then this weekend I have to go to my grandparents in Twin Falls for the 4th, now thats gonna be uber fun, well hey, I shouldnt be sarcastic, it beats sittin around the house playin AC I guess, although I could most certainly do without seeing some people who will no doubt there..*grumble* but hey, Ill live, Ive had to live with them my whole life, whats another day right? wont be the last either, better get used to it, but it should be fun, so lets see, lets think about some good stuff thats been goin on, well my dads still here, so thats pretty cool, Ive been slightly more active and overally happy than usual I think, eating alot of food, alot alot, like 50% more than usual, I must be growing...that or just simply getting fat lol, but I hope its option # 1, or I better be heading to the gym sooner than expected =P I probably should anyway, too lazy, need more energy, well I thought I was going to post more tonight but I simply have too many things to do, its already 11:30 and I need to do some midnight shopping at Wal-Mart (thank God for 24/7 stores) and get some things my parents need that Ive been putting off all day, I am an uber procrastinator arent I??? =DD and I have to drop off my blockbuster game...curse it all, curse it all, well it wasnt a monstrous post I guess, but it should make up for the past 3 days or so =P, Im off, goodnight all

      been surfing the web and playing online games for about half a decade now and Ive NEVER seen such a gliched site as this one, wow, talk about problems with the login page, takes me like a minimum of 3 tries to sign in if it even feels like working at all *sigh* oh well, all is good, all is good, just got done moving my aunt into her new house, wasnt near as bad as I thought it was, we were basically done within 1 hour, which was very nice, considering it usually takes quite a bit longer, moving my cousin last week took FOREVER because she just haaaad to get that apartment on the 3rd floor *rolls eyes* lol, ah well, just went to a gamestore yesterday and bought the old ghetto Doom for SNES...no doubt one of the grandfathers of first person shooters, unless of course you count games like Hogan's Alley - lol, that games sweet, and I registered for college finally and am starting to think about this trip to Tahoe a bit, already less than a week away, and though all those things have kept me on my toes this week, it hasnt been the actual main highlight of these past few days, no no, that trophy goes to my good friend, poor thing, seems to be having a rough couple of days, the way she talks about how she wronged me youd think she wouldve accidently killed my mother or something, heheheh its ok though, somehow I even love that part of her, and it is nice to hear a real apology for once, instead of people who do far worse things and then just say "my bad" and figure everything is peachy...she seems to be worrying alot about her not being good enough for me, and in turn worrys me greatly because I just hope she doesnt do what Ive done in the past, which is worry so much about me not deserving something instead of enjoying it, Ill actually throw it away, ironically enough, IIIII almost pulled that one a few days ago when she sent me that present, holy cow, nicest present Ive ever received in all my life, because I knew it all came from her heart, I got to thinkin about that and all shes done for me and it made me want to bail on all everything cause I knew I could NEVER amount to it, either way I hope this never happens because I think it would be a huge mistake, seeing as how I love her so much...I would do anything to be able to take this burden off her heart, yea, she screwed up, but it doesnt matter at all, it was a minor thing by anyones standards, and I forgave her and loved her all the same even before she said she was sorry, (besides I know my screw up list is a long one, and only gonna get longer =P), Ive found more and more that its not what happens to you in this life that matters, its what you do in response to what happens. The trick isnt to never let the person you love down, to always be there for them, to give them the best...its only to TRY to do all the above and accept the fact that you will never be perfect and cant give them all they deserve in your eyes. Thats why I think forgivness is such a huge key to any relationship, without it, I dont think one can even survive, certainly could never flourish, so I dont know how much these words are going to help her, or if they will really make her feel any better, but I just wish she knew that all the great and lovely and beautiful things shes put in my life already so far make up for this its not even comparable, its like letting 1 black grain of sand on the whole beach get you down, thats how much everything else youve done makes up for this, to the point where its invisible, doesnt even matter, youre always going to fail me, and yourself, but in my heart its already forgotten and gone, and it should be in yours too.... I already have everything I want, everything I need, everything I ever dreamed of or asked for from God, everything that makes me happy, everything that makes me whole, everything that makes me love life and everything in it, more than I deserve, more than I ever even expected to have in my entire life, and that everything is you, youre my world, I havent even seen your face yet but I see you, feel you, hear you, and smell you in everything, I love you so much, nothing in the world could change that or even damage it, I just hope more than anything right now that I wont forget, that I wont ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER forget how much I love you, or forget to tell you every single day for the rest of my life...youre the best, dont forget it =)
