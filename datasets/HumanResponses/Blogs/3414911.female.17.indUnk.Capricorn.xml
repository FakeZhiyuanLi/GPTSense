       Maybe Mr. Ritscher is just a sad little man with no ideas of his own, who is doomed to pursue Mr. Dowd's shadow in hopes of being "cool": cool enough to have an opinion on every little thing and think we all love him for it.

       it looks like you missed commenting on some of the blogs, Mr. Dowd. and i was getting so interested in yuriko.   now this is finally getting interesting. thanks for the anecdotes from your childhood...i always wanted to hear more about the childhood of the lovable coordinator we know. ritscher, please share some stories too... but andrew is right: you are beginning to fall into your habit of agreeing with mr dowd. geez, ritscher, when are you going to get ideas of your own?

       the one place you really don't want a tick How does one get a tick on their testicles? I have no idea, but it happened to me when I was about twelve years-old. No, I wasn't doing naked push-ups in a field of unmowed grass. And no, I wasn't attempting to impregnate a rabbit. I had actually returned from the public swimming pool and was removing my bathing suit when I noticed a black thing down there. I thought it was debris of some sort and attempted to brush it away. It didn't budge. Upon closer inspection, it was obvious that I had become host to tick. He was already swollen and apparently feeding away. What was he after? Sperm? What could he hope to accomplish down there? Who cares. I wanted the thing off me. I had known enough though to not just rip it out. I did what any confused kid does, I asked my mom. I don't recall how I told her, but I'm sure it went something like this - "Mom, I have a tick on my balls." In any case, she checked it out (insert joke here), and was all panicked since it was already embedded and stuff. She was concerned that improper removal could result in sterility or something dramatic like that.  Next thing you know I'm in the car with my dad on the way to the emergency room. Awesome. After all of these years I can't remember how long I had to sit in the emergency room with a tick on my testicles, but I don't think I was there too long. If this were an episode of ER, it would have gone like this:  Dad: Excuse me nurse, we have a situation here.  Nurse: What's going on?  Dad: My son has a tick on his testicles.  Nurse: Oh my god!  [loudspeaker: paging Dr. Gringus... Dr. Gringus, report to ER immediately]  Nurse: Let me have a look. [jumps back in horror]  Dr. Gringus: Jesus Nancy, get me vaseline and tweezers... stat!  Nurse: Ok, you're going to feel a pinch.  [I pass out...]  Alright, so I know it didn't happen like that. I do remember laying on my back though with my pants down as several medical people hovered over my genital area. It was great. They got the thing out somehow and I was quickly released with a smile. I'm sure I went home and played with LEGOs afterwards or something stupid like that.

       I'm Roger Dowd, and I will be checking this blog regularly for any published perversity towards the IB program, Thornton High, or me. If I happen upon any of this nonsense I will make sure that every last one of you receive a 2 on your history exams if you catch my drift, understood?

       i found something interesting to post. maybe some of you have seen this, and i know for a fact that some of you have (and didn't think it was amusing. what's wrong with you?), but it's worth posting again and again.  http://www.houstonjusticenotwar.org/articles/terrorist_attack/  'no one wants to see that shit.' haha. you'll know when you see it.

       so, what   is   supposed to be going on here, other than hellos? what do we have to say that's interesting, really? anyhow, a fish in a bowl has slightly more freedom because it can move in 3 dimensions in the water. the hamster can only run on the bottom and climb halfway up the side. but then...who likes movement anyway? movement is for the active. i'm tired.

       yeah, so i'm with tyler on this one, the livejournal has got all of my attention. not much going on in here anyways, just a bunch of hi's and hello's. i guess i may as well write... erm, type something interesting that people might actually want to read. wait, i don't ever have anything interesting to say. nevermind.

       So I created an LJ community for our class, called THSIB04 (www.livejournal.com/~thsIB04), but I figure we can use both of these groups - if people want to create a LiveJournal (an online diary that many of us are already using) they can go to livejournal.com and create one, and join our group.  If not, we can keep using this too.  Just thought I'd create more options. By the way, breakfast at Karen's in the Country tomorrow at 9:30 - if you're interested, call Ashley Saxon.

       Hello everyone who has decided to participate in this livejournal thing.  I hope the first day of the rest of your lives was fun or at least interesting.  If not get a job slackers!! Just kidding... working sucks.  Become rich and retire when you are still young!!

       yeah well... i wish i had known that beforehand. whether you use it or not is up to you guys. i can't force you guys to use this, but i figure that an odd 10 or so of you is using livejournal... and having sent out the invites already, it's kinda hard to rescind. If there's a massive migration over to livejournal, that's fine and ill go ahead over there, but i have a feeling that once kids start joining... if they join... they will stay here. If you want to do livejournal, you should set up a blog there and send out invites because truthfully, sending out invites for 50 people is a pain in the ass and i don't want to have to do it again...

       People mess around all u want, but i mean show some respect for Mr. Dean alright, he was a teacher we all had that we all had to deal with his death, so please just don't be assholes and take messing around to the point where it is really not that funny anymore.  Im not trying to sound like the MOM of this blog for the record.

       Hey guys, I just joined this, cuz you know that I am slow and stuff.  But anyways, I just want to say that this is a good idea to keep in touch, but I do not like the fact that someone is posting anonymously, and saying mean stuff, well unless it is a joke, and I am just out of the loop.  But I hope that I can saty in touch with you all this way, and someone please explain to me about the mean comments, and why one of the posts says that it was posted by Mr. Dean, cuz that is weird, and not funny either. Thanks. Angela Oza

       I highly doubt more people are gonna join over the summer.  U should have sent out emails about it at the end of summer and that might have worked better.  But oh well.

       I've already talked to several people about this idea and so far they all agree it can be kinda fun to have a breakfast/dinner gathering before we all head off to college.&nbsp; I am thinking this should be sometime in the first week of august.&nbsp; I dunno for those of you who still read this give me some feedback.&nbsp; I was thinking that first weekend because chances i might be throwing a big ass kegger, so besides just hanging out for one last time, i will also let you sheltered IB experience a party so you don't freak out in college, JK.&nbsp; But still give me some feedback...

       Wow, it has been a month and no one has anything new to say.&nbsp; For some reason this really does not surprise me, but I realized today that I might never see half of you ever again.&nbsp; I wont walk into the first class of the first day of a new year and know everyone in it, and laugh at the people who walk in and think they are in the right class but really are not.&nbsp; As much as we have grow to nearly hate eachother, we were always stuck together.&nbsp; What is even better is that I have engulfed myself in the IB world for the past four years of my life, and yet hardly anyone has heard of it.&nbsp; Four years of my life... which could end tomorrow and therefore those four years would be the most important, or I could live to be 80 and hardly remember those of you who I may never see.&nbsp; Bryan created this blog to try to reattach the IB bond... but how long will we even remember one another when we are off in our own little careers... driving into the garage of our houses then going inside to turn on the tv.&nbsp; I wonder where you will all be 20 years from now.&nbsp; If you are content with the life you chose, or festering in mediocrity.&nbsp; I wonder where I will be... but such is life.
