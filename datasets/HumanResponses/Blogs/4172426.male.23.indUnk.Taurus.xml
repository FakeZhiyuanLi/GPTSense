      There's a story over at Beliefnet's Buddhist section on "Mindful Drinking."  I'm really going to have to disagree with this one.  I realize that the author is trying to convey the message that one can suppress their drinking to a level where you don't "get drunk," and then you can be able to relax.     Within the context of strong discipline and clear intention, alcohol holds the possibility of no longer acting as a conventional escape, but instead being a tool for loosening the subtle clinging of ego.   I'll just boil it down to this:  there are many books and magazines out there written on Buddhism, and while it's enjoyable to read them (I do), you truly only need to hear/read the words of the Buddha to know the way.  There are also many tools out there that practitioners use to try to "relax," but all you really need is your breath and a clear mind (alright, a zafu is nice too).    Alcohol is a very dangerous substance, and can lead to moments where you're completely unaware of what's going on.  It's not like reading a book, playing a video game, or going out with friends.  It's like Thich Nhat Hanh's "mindful dishwashing."  You can always be in the present moment (and essentially meditating) no matter what you're doing.  But when it comes to drugs, they chemically change you to the point where you really don't have control of yourself, or your mind.  Bottom line:  it's bad...if you want to relax, just breathe!  It'll save you money, there's no legal age, and it doesn't cause you to have headaches or end up making decisions which lead to very bad karma!   urlLink Link.

      Why is everybody so nuts about the PSP over the DS?  The DS was actually playable at E3, the PSP was not, yet everyone was all for the PSP.  The PSP is essentially a mini PS2.  There's nothing new about it.  I don't want to own two PS2s.  I'll stick with the one that plays on any size screen, not a tiny one.  The DS is full of innovations and twists on classic games.  It's worth it just for the game dubbed as the "New Super Mario Bros."  Call it Super Mario Bros. 4 and I'll get in line TODAY.  Meanwhile, the PSP has...Gran Turismo 4...Medieval...etc.  The same stuff on the PS2.  I will give them credit for the Metal Gear turn-based game or whatever, but that's all Kojima, not Sony.  Nintendo's line-up is also of familiar licensed characters, but again, they're different games, not dumbed down versions of other games.  We'll see what happens.  Either way the winner will be the GBA:  it's cheap, small, good battery life and most importantly, has excellent games.    And to condense two dorky posts into one, take a look at the new line-up for the Classic GBA series:  Metroid, Dr. Mario, Zelda II, and Castlevania.  A big thumbs up for the last two, but Dr. Mario is not worth 20 bucks, and neither is Metroid considering it already is on the Metroid Zero Mission cart which costs an extra $5-$10.   urlLink Link.

      ...but still no Newsradio.  Oh well, this has to be the #3 DVD set I'm looking forward to this year.  #1 is Newsradio.  #2?  Zeta Gundam.  Yes, all $199.99 of it.  I'm a dork.  Oh, and Evangelion Platinum doesn't count cuz it's being released one disc at a time.  I'm a double dork.  I'm a triple dork for saying double dork.  Okay, that's enough for now.   urlLink Link.

      Okay, I'm sure everyone has picked up on this.  A network such as, oh, we'll say...almost all of them...has an award show that nobody really cares about.  For example, the recent G-Phoria on G4TechTV, the MTV Movie/Video/Ego-Trip Awards, the TV Land Gives Trophies to People in Walkers Who Were On One Episode of 'Leave it to Beaver' in 1962 and Can Now Barely Talk Awards, and so forth.  So these are fun, sure, but do they really need to repeat them like 150 times within the next month and a half?  The answer is no.  My compliments to ESPN for limiting the broadcast of Espy Awards to only a few repeats.

      This article from gamesindustry.biz looks at the recent trend of violent videogames, in particular Manhunt, from Rockstar North, the studio who created the awful Grand Theft Auto series (uh oh, the conservative in me is coming out).  I remember when Super Smash Bros. Melee came out, I played it with one of my Xbox-loving friends was literally blown out of his mind that a game that looked like it was for kids could be fun.  ANY game can be fun, no matter what it looks like.  I still think the games on the NES and Super Nintendo are multiple times better than the majority of games out now, and of course, compared to modern graphics, look awful.  Look how people complained when shots for the first Gamecube Zelda game, Wind Waker, were released and it was cel shaded.  People threw a fit!  Then it won tons of game awards.  But going back to violence, games can be "violent" and still be good, as long as they are fun, but when they are created to blatantly have situations in that would allow for extreme violence, such as GTA and Manhunt, then that's ridiculous.  Should we ban these games?  Absolutely not, that's not anybody's choice to make.  Anyways, here's the article, and check out the rest of the site, it's very excellent.   urlLink Link.

      This is stupid.  First of all, if you don't like your date, just say, "you know what, I can tell that we're not really compatible, so I think I'll just head out now, but thanks anyway.  Take care."  The date, realizing that it wasn't working out on the other end, should think "oh, okay.  Well good thing he/she didn't let that drag on so that we ended up getting hurt worse in the end."  Of course that's in happy fantasy world.  In the real world people can't understand each other so they have to lie.  And not only do these people lie, they need assistance lying.  So you can subscribe to a service where your cell provider will call you and tell you what to say if you want to get out of the date.   When the cell rings, one of Cingular's eight "emergency" messages says: "Hey, this is your Escape-A-Date call. If you're looking for an excuse, I got it. Just repeat after me, and you'll be on your way! 'Not again! Why does that always happen to you? ... All right, I'll be right there.' Now tell 'em that your roommate got locked out, and you have to go let them in. Good luck!"   The worst part?  Cingular's is *five dollars a month!*  Virgin's is 25 cents per use.  5x12=60 bucks.  Donate the 60 bucks to a local charity and stop lying to people.  Good night, everyone.   urlLink Link.

      I was fortunate enough to see two of my TV heroes this past year, Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld.  They were both hilarious, but Seinfeld was really amazing.  One of his jokes I really related to.  He was talking about how it took so long for him to get married and have kids (as if it's a requirement of life) and he said that whenever he'd go out somewhere and see a couple with a child he'd think to himself, "why would anybody want to completely destroy their lives like that?"  This is *exactly* how I feel.  I don't know if it will ever change for me, but the idea of me having children is completely out of the question.  Working at both a toy store and Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom is a huge shot of birth control.  As insane as it sounds, it was rare to see more than 50% of families that I encountered truly happy.  I understand there are many happy moments in raising a child, but I'm happy now single.  I don't feel the need for children now, and I may never.  Why try to obtain those few happy moments when I would have at the least an equal amount of grief?  To me, it isn't worth it.  I could see myself getting married, but I'm not just going to settle for somebody either just because marriage is something you're "supposed to do."  I made that mistake before and got engaged, and didn't realize my mistake until she left me.  Sure we had a good deal in common, but there were things that we didn't click with that really bothered each of us...yet we got engaged anyway.  Thank goodness it ended, for both of us really.  Nobody should let that happen, I most certainaly won't let that happen ever again.  I think a lot of people believe they have a set plan in life, where you have to get X job and marry Y person and have Z kids.  They should just go with the flow and let whatever happen happen.  Don't force yourself into situations, and think about if it's a good idea or not.  "Isn't it time for you to get settled down?"  Why should there be a time to settle down?  What if I don't meet anyone until I'm 50...or maybe ever?  That's not going to destroy me.  The Buddha's words are true, if we let go of attachments, such as the idea of "settling down," then we can just be happy with the present we're in.  This is a world full of many attatchments.  Life is a lot better without them!

      So I'm watching a little television when one of those fast paced freaky Target commercials comes on that are aimed to intice youngsters to buy their home furnishings, along with everything else from their establishment.  I won't even get into the question of why 14 year olds would want to buy home furnishings when, just taking a guess here, but I don't think many teenagers own their own home.  Anyhoo, the commercial is flipping between multiple rooms where kids are using a number of name brand products (presumably all available at Target), and they get to the last room where a group is "hanging out."  There's a little bucket full of ice and beverage cans in the corner and a guy takes two cans, giving one to a female friend and keeping the one for himself.  What's blowing my mind here is that it's Red Bull!  I don't think that kids, let alone anyone, should be drinking Red Bull as a casual drink!  I don't see the purpose of high caffinated beverages at all, but drinking it like it's water?  "Boy, I'm thirsty, hand me a RED BULL."  Does that sound okay with you?  I tried one of those Mountain Dew Amp's once and I started having the symptoms of a *speed user.*  Alright, that's enough for now.

      I'm going to try and avoid lots of politics on this site cuz it can really drive me crazy.  We'll see if I actually stick to that plan in a month.  Anyhoo, some things must be noted.  For example, this latest gem:   "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."—"President" George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Aug. 5, 2004   Along with that, there is a concert tour coming up featuring a number of really awesome artists, including one of my favourites, Death Cab for Cutie, and they're going to be in Kissimmee in October!  Follow the link for information on the concerts.  I don't know if we need these concerts, though...after that quote from Bush this week, maybe he's going to start being honest!

      Zelda II:  The Adventure of Link is really underrated.  It drives me crazy when people say they didn't like it because it veered too far away from the original.  What about Ocarina of Time, the most *over*rated game of all time?  Anyways, I was never more excited completing a game than when I was in 5th grade (or somewhere in elementary school) and finally finished Zelda II.  It took me a year and a half of weekends on and off playing it.  Anyways, some cat beat it in an hour and a half.  Check out the other great times on this site too.   urlLink Link.

      Welcome to my first day of working on this page.  Every now and then I plan on having what I call a "Mega Post," which essentially is an article I've written.  I have some ideas spinning around my head that I would like to work on when I get a chance.  For now, though, I'm pulling out a few that I've written in the past.  This one was written during my last semester at Millersville University for a class called "Critical Cultural Studies."  At least I think that's what it was called.  Anyways, the article was about the film "Groundhog Day" and how it was essentially a teaching in Buddhism for the layperson.  While this argument has been brought up many times, I couldn't find anything written to explain it to somebody who knew nothing about Buddhism, let alone the film.  So here it is, one of my few papers that actually received a perfect grade!  Buddhism has slowly worked its way into the West, the same way that Bodhidharma slowly walked his way into the East from India.  Some of the great American writers of the 19th century including Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson helped bring Indian text into the country, including the Bhagavad-Gita and The Light of Asia. After reading Introduction to Indian Buddhism, Thoreau introduced the first specifically Buddhist text to America, by translating portions of the Lotus Sutra and publishing them in The Dial.  Over the years, many of the Buddha’s sutras, along with other related texts, have been translated into English and published here in the United States.  Recently, as motion pictures have broadened their horizons, there have been many films specifically with a Buddhist theme.  Such titles as Kundun, chronicling the story of the young Dalai Lama, and Seven Years in Tibet, about a mountaineer who befriends His Holiness, focus on the Tibetan side of Buddhism.  While these films show a slice of a significant Buddhist culture, they don’t specifically aim to teach any of the Buddha’s lessons.  Regarding India, where Buddhism originated some 2500 years ago, there is also the film version of Herman Hesse’s classic novel Siddhartha, in which a young Brahman decides to ignore the path of the Buddha, and find his own path, ultimately finding the same answers.  When the movie was released in 1972, there remained no better film to help explain to people what the Buddha taught.  In our contemporary society, it is difficult to understand some of the ideas being expressed in Siddhartha.  There is one film, however, which completely conveys a lesson in the teachings of the Buddha, focused on the belief of something called “samsara.”  This teaching is easier for an American audience to relate to, being that it is set in a small, modern-day Western Pennsylvanian town.  The film is the 1993 Harold Ramis comedy, Groundhog Day.  The movie is essentially broken up into eight parts.  Part one introduces us to Phil Connors, a weatherman for a local Pittsburgh news station played by Bill Murray.  It doesn’t take the audience long to discover that Phil is a rotten guy.  This concept is set up from when he ends his report in the studio, up until that evening.  Phil is a liar; he puts on a phony act for the studio’s cameras, and for the anchor.  Once the cameras turn away, he starts to make rude comments towards the anchor.  Phil also has a negative attitude about the here and now, saying he wants to get this whole trip over with, and repeatedly mentioning that another network is interested in hiring him.  He’s very concerned about his professional appearance, commenting during their drive to Punxsutawney that he worries he’ll have no future if the wrong person were to see him interviewing a groundhog.     During this first part we also meet Phil’s new producer, Rita, played by Andie MacDowell.  It’s obvious from first glance that Rita is Phil’s opposite.  The first shot of her is playing in front of the chromakey screen, laughing like a little kid.  Her first words are about the groundhog festival, saying she likes the whole idea about people having simple fun.  Phil’s reaction is that people are idiots and he hates people.  Even after Phil’s negative attitude is sprung on her, Rita keeps smiling and actually goes through with a nice gesture to Phil, putting him in a bed and breakfast instead of the hotel he stayed at last year which he disliked.  Phil seems to have difficulty accepting the kindness that has been given to him.    Siddhartha Gautama, better known as the Buddha, was born in India around 2500 years ago.  He was a prince, but never enjoyed the pleasures of wealth and power that were offered to him.  At one point in his life, Siddhartha was able to leave the palace, and he encountered four people:  a sick man, an elderly man, a dead man, and a monk.  He was then struck with the grim reality that life is rough, we all get older, and then we all die.  Noticing the monk was at peace, he decided that the only way he would discover true happiness is if he became a monk.  When he was older he married and had a son, but even this did not stop him from leaving the palace and becoming a monk, something that most people in this era did when they were older and their lives were coming to an end, not during the prime of their life.  He traveled from teacher to teacher, quickly becoming equals to them all, when finally he had no one else to teach him.  He decided that since he was so unhappy when bombarded with sense pleasures, he’d devoid himself of almost everything, eating only the bare minimum of food, and drinking as little water as possible.  After about six years he realized this wasn’t the way to go, so he decided to get some proper nourishment and then meditate under a tree, and not move until he knew the answer.  A few weeks later he came to the conclusion that if extreme indulgence in pleasures wasn’t the key to happiness, but the opposite wasn’t either, then a middle path would be the way to go.  He shared his teaching for the first time with his former ascetic friends who thought Siddhartha had abandoned them.  The first teaching was the “four noble truths.”  The first truth is that life is suffering, meaning, our lives are filled with suffering, such as sadness, grief, and any other kind of mental of physical disturbance.  Second is the cause of suffering, which is attachment to the sense pleasures in this world.  Thirdly is ending suffering, which is done by ending the craving.  The final part is the way of ending suffering, “the noble eightfold path.”  Phil Connors must be on the “un-noble” eightfold path.  He is a liar, putting on an act and isn’t his true self.  This does not follow one of the steps of the path, which is “right speech.”  Not only is this part of the noble eightfold path, its part of the first five precepts.  Unlike other religions, there are no set rules for Buddhists.  Monks, however, must follow anywhere between 10 (Theravada tradition) to 36 (Tibetan tradition) precepts.  The layperson only takes the first five.  Those include vowing not to kill, steal, have improper sexual relations, lie, or take intoxicants.  While doing one of these acts doesn’t prevent you from trying to live the Buddhist way, it definitely doesn’t help you any.  As the movie continues, Phil successfully breaks every single precept, and while it doesn’t destroy him, nor does it prevent him from finally stopping the cycle of endless Groundhog Days, it sure doesn’t help him stop it any quicker.  Now that the audience has been introduced to the insolent that is Phil Connors, he enters his first February 2nd, the second part of the movie, thus beginning a cycle.  This cycle can be compared to what the Buddhists called “samsara.”  This is the endless cycle of birth and death, meaning when you die, you are reborn into life, and as the first noble truth says, “life is suffering.”  The way one stays in samsara is by being a bad person, or generating bad “karma.”   Be a good person, and you generate good karma, and if you finally build up enough “karma points,” so to speak, then the cycle finally ends.  As Phil continues to be a terrible person, which is evident in this first Groundhog Day, the farther he gets from ending the cycle.   Phil is rude to Mrs. Lancaster, the owner of the bed and breakfast, although she offers him kindness.  The same applies to Ned Ryerson.  Although Ned is quite annoying, Phil doesn’t even want to give a genuine smile to him.  Also, Phil is unwilling to help the elderly homeless man, not even giving him a dollar or two.   Rita, who continuously becomes the model of goodness in this film, is appalled by Phil’s behavior, which she only gets to witness for the short period they film the ceremony.  While Phil is annoyed by the observance, Rita finds joy out of it.  A snowstorm prevents them from leaving the town, and the next day, Phil awakes to February 2nd again.  While Phil tries to place the blame on outside circumstances, particularly the snowstorm, but also psychological problems and physical brain disorders, the real problem lies within him.  Yet he is far from realizing this and the cycle continuously repeats.  The film enters part three when Phil chooses to stay in samsara.  He continues to hurt others and does wrong just to indulge himself in sense pleasures and do whatever he wants.  Included on this list are driving recklessly and destroying the town, becoming a glutton, tricking a woman by the name of Nancy into believing they went to high school together so that he could sleep with her, and using his time to memorize the sequence of events around an armored truck so that he can steal money from them and purchase luxurious items, including a car and fancy clothing, along with using that cash to seduce another woman.    There is a parable given by the Buddha in his Lotus Sutra, one of his most recognized teachings, which best explains samsara.  There are some children playing in a house that is burning.  Their father is outside, unable to run in and get them.  The children are so absorbed in their games that they don’t know the peril they are stuck in.  So the father promises them each a large carriage if they run out right now.  The children run out, their lives saved because of their father’s generosity.  Phil is oblivious to his destructive behavior, which is like being trapped in the burning building, but continuing to stay inside because he’s caught up in his fun.    Phil has now successfully broken the last four precepts, along with completely swerving off of the noble eightfold path.  As mentioned before, right speech is one of the eight parts, however there is also right view, which means knowing the difference between right and wrong.  Right thinking is like capturing our mind so that it does not wander.  If it does wander it’s difficult to harness right speech and also right action, which are the five precepts previously mentioned.  Right diligence, right concentration, and right livelihood follow, and are all tied together by right mindfulness.  When Phil is going on his rampage through town with the two inebriated men, he says, “you make choices, and you live with them.”  Right mindfulness goes back to the saying “think before you talk or act,” but instead you’re always aware of what you’re doing, so, in a way, there’s no need to have to stop to think.  This way, you can make the right choices, and live a better life with them.   During the fourth part of the film, Phil continues his bad behavior, this time aiming it towards Rita, someone who is genuinely good, and as the audience finds out, cannot be fooled.  Phil wants Rita to love him, more than likely so he can seduce her the way he did Nancy, so he constructs a fake reality.  He does this by making mental notes of what Rita likes and dislikes, and incorporating them into each successive Groundhog Day, so that the “perfect day” can be constructed.  On the one occasion that Phil is closest to being successful, Rita still sees right through him.  Phil couldn’t harness the spontaneity of the day that was closest to perfect again, and slowly it became more and more unnatural.    Part five of the film has Phil becoming incredibly depressed.  He craves Rita, but he cannot get her.  Again, the four noble truths come into play.  Phil is now suffering because he cannot get what he craves.  If he destroys this craving, he will no longer suffer.  Phil is becoming incredibly tired of the continuous loop.  He’s milked every sense pleasure he could out of Punxsutawney on February 2nd.  Phil decides to try and kill himself, taking the groundhog with him, still believing that the cause of this day is not within him, now putting the blame on the groundhog ceremony.  He wakes again and realizes that even death won’t end this cycle, it just starts it over again even quicker then if he went through the whole day.  Phil has now broken every precept, because he has killed himself, repeatedly, and killed the groundhog once.  Phil is finally asking Rita, who has offered to help Phil on many occasions, for help.  This begins the sixth part of the movie.  Rita, being the kind soul she is, spends the day with Phil, trying to help him “get out.”  One scene in the diner may spark the realization that everyone is feeling what he is experiencing, just in a different way.  From the waitress who has worked there for life, wanting to go to Paris, to Phil’s drinking friend who wishes he had stayed in the Navy, to the Penn State graduate who has been looking for work for three years, but waits tables instead.  Phil has been given a gift, the opportunity to make up for lost time, and up until now, he hasn’t used it to his advantage.  Rita, being the optimistic one, says, “maybe it’s not a curse, it all depends on how you look at it.”  Phil speaks to Rita while she’s asleep, expressing his feelings.  Essentially, Phil still wants Rita, but even more importantly now, Phil wants to be like Rita.  He knows that he’s not good enough for her now, however he knows that he can change.  The Dhammapada is a collection of over 400 verses, a book that has been around as long as the Buddha’s teachings have.  The key concept at this moment of the film is expressed in one of the book’s verses:  “The Tathagatas merely show the way; you must make the effort.  Through meditation and equanimity, you free yourself from the bonds of Mara.”  In short, having the knowledge doesn’t do anything for Phil; he must now act upon this, and try to be a good person.  In the seventh part of the movie, Phil does a pretty good job trying to be a decent person.  While he doesn’t have it down pat just yet, he is getting there.  Instead of bypassing the old man, he just gives him a wad of cash, followed by delivering breakfast to Rita and Larry.  He also decides to use his time wisely, personally enriching himself.  He is shown reading more often, and he also learns to play the piano and ice sculpt.  The final turning point in the film comes when Phil sees the old homeless man in an alley.  He tries to help him, but unfortunately, the man passes that night.   No matter what Phil tries to do for the man, even if he spends the whole day with him, he always dies.  Back to that basic teaching, life is suffering, and that includes the loss of someone.  Phil uses this pain to make him stronger instead of starting a cycle of depression again, and now realizes that he must do good for those who will be lucky enough to see tomorrow.  On Phil’s last Groundhog Day, Phil takes all the skills he has learned, along with some more which it seems we didn’t see on camera, and helps everyone he can.  He saves a boy from falling, changes a tire, fixes someone’s back, stops someone from choking, plays the piano for the town at a party, and ice sculpts for Rita.  Phil has now become a person like Rita, genuinely good, and because of that, she’s fallen for him, and more importantly, the cycle has finally ended.    On that last February 2nd evening, Phil sums up the key to happiness by saying this to Rita:  “No matter what happens tomorrow, or for the rest of my life, I’m happy now, because I love you.”  Phil has embraced the concept of being a good person and helping others, and also isn’t worried if he has to wake up to another Groundhog Day, because he has become a genuinely happy person.  This is how he successfully ends the miniature cycle of samsara he got himself into.  While Buddhist groups have claimed this movie for themselves, nobody has written anything about why they have.  One could watch this movie and easily understand the message about being a good person to make your “same thing happens everyday” life into a more rewarding and vastly different experience.  When people find religion, they watch this film and discover the correlation between their faith or spirituality and the lessons taught in the film.  In the case of Buddhism, it is easy to see how well the film and the teachings of the Buddha match up.  Groundhog Day is truly an essential text for modern Buddhist teachings.

      Check out this article from Media Post regarding the future of television, in particular television channels.  Here is a very intersting fact:  "Interestingly, the number of channels that are actually tuned by the average U.S. household has not changed and remains constant at 15, or roughly 15 percent of channels receivable." The article also discusses a future with no channels.  I've been lucky enough to experience TiVo for an entire year (until it broke...*sigh*) along with the new "OnDemand" feature of Comcast Digital Cable which I had when I lived in Lancaster.  While there was a limited amount of content, there still was a good number of programs considering how new the technology was.  Anyways, the whole idea of whatching whatever whenever is fantastic, but I still enjoy channel flipping now and then.   urlLink Link.
