      Ok, so, i used to have a weblog at xanga.com, with all my friends as well. and it just got to the point that...i  couldn't  anymore. i was so tired of not being able to be open (my friends and i are close-knit, but i have a thingee i keep from them and it's just getting bigger, yeah, more on that later) and it hurt me, 'cause i knew how easy it would be to just say, 'hey!' but i can't! oh man, i'm silly, and secretive, and bashful.  anyway, the huge secret? not that big: i don't have cancer, know the formula for cold fusion, have a secret life as a prostitute, my parents aren't getting divorced...it's not anything that big. *heaves a huge sigh* ok, this is tough to say in the open. i have a crush on one of my friends, who read my site, kyle. a HUGE crush, a crush that makes it hard to breathe, and lives up to the name *crush*!  ok, enough for today? you're probably bored. :) later, i'm out.

      today is at least a year, if not two, since my last post. in that meantime, i've had three other xanga sites, multiple mini crushes, one devastating one, and more other random things that i can possibly say. i am apart from my friends once again. perhaps by choice this time, i learned this year that between those i hold dearest and myself is a completely different value system. i can't expect to change people, to make friends conform to what i hold important. i have to change. one year. one year more. one year more and no more. no more. no more.
