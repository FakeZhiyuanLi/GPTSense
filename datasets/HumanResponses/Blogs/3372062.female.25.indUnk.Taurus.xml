      Well, at least my cold is better.  After 2 8 hour nights, I don't go in until 8PM tonight, it'll seem like it flies by, at least I hope it does.    Last night was slow, until 11 or so, when the place just exploded.  It seemed like every guy that had attended the Wolves game ended up at the club.  Lots of yuppie types, 25-30, money to spend, polo shirts and khakis.  Made over $550, but I was exhausted.    My online poker world has gone nuts the past couple days.  I made my calls per normal, but skipped my usual visits to my in-city theaters.  So, I played 2-3 hours each day, and am just cleaning up.  $9399 as I logged off today, entered two one table tourneys and won them both.  Basically, when you enter a NL tourney, you only stay in if you have AA, KK, or AK the first few hands.  By the time you've made one round, there's often only 3-5 players left, as people think going all in is a good move ALL THE TIME.  I won $300 (minus $50 entry fee), then $700 (minus $100 entry fee) both today.   In one hand today, playing $15/30, I had an A/10, and had 2 10's in the middle.  The last card was an Ad, the 4th diamond in the middle.  That gave me a full house, but another player had the Kd, so thought he had the hand won, with the highest possible flush, so he raised in all the way, as did I.  You could sense his shock as the pot came to me.  The pot was over $500, so that was a nice win.  Funny, the Drudge Report acts as if Shrek beating Day is a surprise, but we insisted our theaters keep Shrek in its largest capacity, as on holiday weekends, the adults follow the kids.  Crappy weather makes for incredible crowds as well.  I think yesterday was as big a day as I've ever seen, many shows were sold out, and even some older/less popular films were selling 100-150 seats a show.  Concessions were big as well.    I'm watching the NCAA Women's Softball tourney on ESPN, and I just don't understand the Jennie Finch appeal.  Don't get me wrong, she's a busty blonde, but she's so "big" compared top most women.  Broad shoulders, big legs, I'm surprised she's as popular as she is.  Her face doesn't strike me pretty either.  Compared to other well-known female athletes, Kournikova is drop-dead gorgeous, Summer Sanders is stunning, and Gabby Reese is also larger, but more feminine.   All for now, talk to you later.

      Took a couple days off of both blogging and of work.  Had plenty of sick days, so what the hell.  So, I've been off since Tuesday, 3 straight days, which is cool.  I work tonight through Monday night at "the club", as many took off Memorial Day weekend.  It always seems to be easy to say yes, it'll be a lot of money, etc, but damn, 4 nights in heels for 6-8 hours is tough.    Played at Canterbury last night from 4-7, lost about $50.  Somehow, I'm up almost $1000 in my online account since last week (about $7500 now), even though it seems like I've played less and haven't won much.    I'm going to nap before heading to work tonight.  Talk to you soon.  By the way, Aaron, I've missed you.:)

      Did my normal routine of sleeping in, working out, and heading to Canterbury today.  Played 4 hours, a long stretch for me, and came home and watched the Wolves lose.  Not surprised, but disappointed.    Played at a $8/16 table all the time.  Normal characters, old guy after me who pays to see every flop, then folds almost every hand post-flop.  I fold about 80-85% of the time before the flop, as I do not feel it's worth paying to see if I'm lucky unless I have a good start.  One guy folded every time around the table 4 times, except once or twice when he was in the big blind.  There was another young woman at the table, a rarity which was mentioned by every single new player for the 3 hours we were there.     Wow, I wish I could play at this table every time.    I feel as if I already won.   And those were the good lines.  The older fella kept touching my thigh, but he was all over the place, in many ways.  He smelled like Pine Sol.  You know, I like to think this is an eccentric guy who is spending a small portion of a huge bankroll that would otherwise go to spoiled grandkids who'd piss it away on a 2nd weekend cottage, but who knows, he might have bet his last dollars today.  Near the end of the session, after "the other woman" left (to loud sighs, followed by glances towards me, as if to say, "Are you stayin'?", I was dealt a 9-9.  I watched as the elderly gent looked at his cards and went, "Yowee" in a voice just slightly less audible than he used to ask what the bet was, every damn hand.  I called, and the guy asked how much he could raise.  He did so, and the table called, and I reraised.  The others looked at me like I had told them the ending to a movie, but I'd added $32 to the pot.  Old guy raised again.  4 in to see the flop.  The flop came A-K-9.  I smiled, as I was thinking the old guy had A-K, for whatever reason.  We raised to the max, and one other player went with us.  Pot was over $200.  Next came a A.  Ouch.  It gave me a full house, 9's over A's, but I was beat if I had guessed his hole cards correctly.  Our accompanying player dropped out, but we raised it to the max again.  $325-350.  The river was a 5.  Also, the 3rd diamond.  I checked, he bet, I raised, he raised.  Finally, all but admitting defeat, I called, having thrown enough money into the pot. It was by far the biggest pile of chips we'd had all day, somwhere in the $425 vicinity.  He proudly turned over---  A-J, and unsuited at that.  I was sorry to turn over my 9's.  I had destroyed what was to him an unbeatable hand, even though I could have beat it with a 3-2 of diamonds.  He looked like I had called him a lousy lover and a cheap date.  Devastated.    A couple players whispered nice hand, and one said, "weak beat".  I left 30 minutes later, and the old guy was still there, seeing every flop and then folding.  I drove thru TCF and deposited my $1680, a tidy $680 more than I had withdrawn earlier.  And I felt bad doing so.    You know, I really wish he would've had the A-K.    And, when we watch the WSOP on ESPN, we aren't going to know a single player, are we?  I think I read only 2 or 3 members of the "non-field" are left, with 4 days to go.

      All right, I can't keep quiet anymore.  I've been reading  urlLink this blog  for months, found it by accident one night, probably by checking the "recently published" ones Blogger always has up.  Michelle seemed like a nice girl, bless her heart, sure she's a music student, meaning she is probably a irritating little ditz who doesn't understand why she has to pay for school, and why we have to have wars, and why we have to pay rent, but she wrote well, so I checked out her blog once a week or so.   So, recently she dropped hints that she was expecting a child, which is obviously unplanned.  And a week ago she made it public.  Hey, I'm all for being positive, and bless her heart for bringing the child into this world, when others would have followed the first incredibly poor decision with another one (though I think it should be legal, it makes me angry it is used for birth control without a second thought).  But, Jesus Christ, you're 20 and you had unsafe sex.  You have nothing to be "proud of".  You are destined to fail, as almost all teen marriages do.  You are destined to be dependent on the government or your families for a minimum of 5 years, and no one would be surprised to see 18 years.    Yes, babies are cute and are a gift from God.  I tear up just thinking of the fact babies get sick and die.  I wanted to be a neo-natal nurse back when I was 14, and even spent half a day in the hospital as part of "career day" when I was in 8th grade.  Due to rules and common sense, most of the time was not spent in the actual room where the babies are.  But, I went in there for about 30-45 minutes and was treated very nicely by a mom whose baby had been there all 3 months of her life.  The child was still very small, and weighed about 5 pounds.  I held her for a couple minutes and was terrified of her fragility.  This happens at random, in life.  I hope to hell the baby that is spoken of on the blog is healthy and is a joy to be around.  But that kid will have to beat the odds.  Not likely to have two parents, not likely to be middle-class.  The idea a bright kid can fall prey to 10 minutes of passion (or, in my experience, less) scares the hell out of me.  If these bright college kids aren't intelligent enough to use protection, what do you expect from a 15 year-old who wants to impress her boyfriend?   Again, I credit her for making the proper decisions now, and for her attitude now.  But, it's tough not being sad about the situation she finds herself in.

      After Day 1 of the WSOP (which actually includes both Saturday and Sunday's results, as no one played both days)   OUT: Phil Ivey Daniel Negreanu Sammy Farha Chris Moneymaker Antonio Esfandiari Men Nyugen Andy Glazer TJ Clotier John Juanda  IN after Day 1: Howard Lederer 13K Phil Hellmuth 33K Johnny Chan 17K Barry Greenstein 23K Erik Seidel 34K Phil Gordon 28K Devilfish Ulliott 60K Kathy Liebert 14K Doyle Brunson 18K Robert Varkonyi 25K Mimi Tran 32K   I was just watching Moneymaker's classic bluff last night when it got down to 2.  He bluffed with nothing but K high, but his opponent Farha only had a pair of 9's, and you can't call a $3.4 million bet with a pair of 9's.    So, those two are out, as is Ivey, who many consider the best young player in the world, if not the best player.    It's a game of skill, but there's a ton of luck involved as well, to say the least.  You know there were a lot of players gunning for the top pros, willing to stay in and hope for a lucky flop, just to get their name out there.    Phil Ivey gets sent home when he makes a pair of Jacks to go with his AKo and his opponent (from Pokerstars apparently) shows him the other two.   You can find this and other info on WSOP on the  urlLink 2+2 Forums .   Daniel Negreanu just busted out from the featured table. In his ESPN exit interview, he says one of his mistakes was trying to bluff too many unbluffable amateurs."   Um, sure thing, Danny.  You lost because you played perfectly, but the others played poorly and got lucky.  I can't believe that was said by someone other than Hellmuth.  Hey, if you lose, you lose.    We are in an age of growth for poker that is beyond comparison, by the way.  800 LY, 2600 TY, what do you think, 10,000 next year if they allow it to be an "open field" (which they should).  I do not claim to be a great, even a good player, but the idea that I could, in theory, get good cards and win the most prestigious title in the world has a ton of appeal.  If guys refuse to play conservatively the first couple days and go out, tough.   Poker Pages has  urlLink near hourly updates  going on.

      Halftime, Wolves up by double digits at the half.  Get together seems to be going well, about 20 people, about 10 more than I expected.  Thankfully, Chinese places deliver, as do pizza places.  A fact to remember, you have to carry 3 point guards on your playoff roster.  You just do.  I suppose if you have a shooting guard who can play the point at a decent level (Ray Allen comes to mind) you can get away with 2, but I wouldn't.  As a former point guard myself, I don't find moving the ball around and such that difficult, but if you're not one, odds are you do.    I had to nap this afternoon I was so tired.  Maybe I'm getting too old for these 18 hour days.  Short of girls last night, which is much like being short waitstaff in a restaurant.  More opportunity for tips, but having to listen the others complain about it is rough.  I'm not not a person that enjoys a negative atmosphere.  Made over $400 though, I was too tired to count.    I found it touching I have several people here from the theater I used to run, which is at least 45 minutes from my residence.  I would never dream of travelling that far, but I guess they wanted to see me.  I actually miss those days, as it was much more fulfilling than what I do now.    Bye for now, hope many of you have bookmarked this spot, as Aaron will be publishing tonight.

      Wow, Aaron devoted his entire blog entry to me Friday, and 1000 people stopped by. He puts butts in the seats, huh? I worked both jobs yesterday, so I'm a bit tired. My schedule yesterday was:   Up at 7:45.   Club 8-9:55   Drive 10-12   Visit #1 12-1:30   Eat lunch 1:30-2   Drive 2-3:30   Visit #2 3:30-4:30   Drive home 4:30-6:15   Shower, watch TV 6:30-7:30   Go to "work" 7:30-7:50   "Work" 8-1:50   Drive home 2-2:20   Wind down, computer time, shower, make a grilled ham & cheese 2:20-4   Alarm went off at 7:10. Yawn.    I almost always stay nearby Friday and Saturday, as it makes a long day if I visit an outlying theater. Especially if I visit 2 of them. But, having delivered all my invites Thursday, I missed visiting my two out-of-state responsibilities. Conference call at 9 every Saturday, as we discuss how the weekend is shaping up, if we need to move any films to the bigger auditoriums, concessions, etc; so I have to be up pretty early and go over the numbers so I sound knowledgeable. Sometimes I'll change it to 8:10, if I'm really tired, but not often. I was disappointed at both visits, as both looked subpar. One was severely underscheduled, as Shrek 2 opened, and it was a very matinee heavy crowd. I walked into the 2nd one and saw lines backed up as long as I ever recall. I glanced across the way, and the 2nd stand was closed, not enough people to man two. No satellite stands open either.   One of the shift managers was running the register, I walked by and asked her where the GM was. She said she didn't know, and smiled at me, sorta making a "you know him" gesture with her hands. I grabbed her walkie talkie off her waist and spoke the GM's name into it. He answered right away, with a happy sounding "Yeah?". I asked where he was, and after a pause, he said, "In the office". I thanked her, put the wt back on its holder. I was all but fuming, but smiled as I walked past the concession associates, saying hi to the ones I recognized.   I strolled to the office, and as I turned the knob, heard laughter. I opened the door, and the GM, DOTO, and another shift manager were all sitting and chatting. The office is barely big enough for all 4 of us, but I shut the door, and softly said, "You're backed up. Do you have the other side or the sats ready?" All 3 stared at me, shocked I was there. I haven't visited an outlying store on a weekend in months. Finally, the GM shook his head no, and said he hadn't even put registers in yet, as he didn't have the workers to run them.   And they wonder how I got promoted after only a few months in their company. And they sit there and make excuses why their numbers are so low. Who the hell would stand there for 20 minutes? So, many folks walk right by, begging to buy a soda or food, but fear missing part of their movie (or the previews, everyone loves previews).   I asked them to please go out and assist. As they hustled out, I said, "And for God sakes, open the register that's empty". I know I don't really mind waiting in line, but if there's a register not being used and "extra" people milling around, it pisses me off.   I stood there for a couple minutes, just calming down. I chuckled as I saw the keys on the desk, knowing someone had forgotten them. You can't do anything without keys, can't open the regs, can't change the temp, get change, anything. I thought to myself how damn hard I'd worked for years to get where I was, and how easy I found my current job. I rolled up my sleeves (literally), and went out to the counter. The DOTO had ended up on the reg, and quite obviously hadn't ran it in months, as she couldn't find the right keys, then it kept beeping as she did things in the wrong order.   I stood behind two of the hourlies, one was mentally disabled, and both were doing fine, just slow. For the most part, I was able to have their sale for them by the time they rang it up. On the 5th one, someone ordered Diet for the first time, and as I punched the L key, it spit out CO2 only, no Diet). As I brushed off the liquid from my dress shirt, the "special" girl said, "Yeah, that's been out since yesterday".   Jesus. I gritted my teeth, walked to the other machine, filled it up, and walked back, smiling. I bagged up some more popcorns, then, with the line only a couple deep (it was at least 10 deep when I entered 10 minutes before), I went in the back and changed the syrup. Luckily, I had the keys, so I was able to do that. So, as the front was caught up, I suggested to the GM he open the other regs, as the after work Friday crowd would be in soon. He said, and I'm not kidding, "Yeah, I was just gonna do that". He trotted off, and returned a couple minutes later. He smiled at me, and walked over to the DOT, and whispered something to her. She said something, he did too, she persisted, and he walked over toward a shift manager. I called out his name, loudly, and he stopped, and dutifully walked over. I handed him his keys, and smiled. He smiled back, and walked away. DOTO needed the keys because she was still all but untrained on register, despite having been there 9 months, and needed them to "cheat".   So, a bit after 4, I had walked around without any crew, checking cleanliness and chatting to older people, as they almost without exception will tell you the truth, good, bad or ugly. One fella said the bathrooms were always dirty, "Pee all over" were his exact words. I thanked him and gave him a free pass, then another. He looked like he had won the lottery. He turned to his wife/ladyfriend and loudly told her. She said, "She must be the owner. Or maybe the owner's daughter."   Finally, at about 4:20, I told the DOT to grab the GM. They came over, and we walked to the office. I let them open the door, and told them to sit down. As she sat, the DOTO looked up at me, crying. I had hired her as a college grad last summer, and I thought she would be superb. She always called and said she was unable to make changes, etc, because her boss never backed her up.   But, I knew she had just walked in, as she closed. It was a GM issue, but she was still the one suffering.   I stood and looked at them, back and forth, for about a minute. I love silence, as it's much worse than words. The GM said he knew he had failed to follow procedure, and apologized. He said he knew several things had been done wrong, or not done at all. The DOTO started full out crying. I handed her the box of tissues and moved behind her, massaging her shoulders. The GM said he took full responsibility, and that DOTO had just walked in. I spoke, and asked her when she had got there, even though I knew. She replied 3, then feeling guilty admitted she had been 10 minutes late. I told her that the lines were her fault, but not to worry about the other stuff. I told her I still liked her and to please leave me alone with her boss. She gave me a hug and left.   It's amazing how different it is talking to another woman.   I looked at the GM and smiled. He smiled back, then quickly frowned. He was 20-25 years my senior, and had always been graded a weak ME, meets expectations. He was never moving up, and we both knew it.   So, I gave my shortest counseling ever.   "(Name), the only good thing I can say is you did open the doors today. It was a U visit (unacceptable) from the minute I walked in, and it went downhill from there. Either pick it up several notches, or update your resume."   I told him I'd see him soon, and shook his hand. He again apologized, and I opened the door, said goodbye to the associates, talked to the ticket takers a couple minutes, and went home.   After that, strutting topless on a stage is a piece of cake. I actually do kind of enjoy it some nights, as many of us "cute" ones enjoy the attention that usually only the gorgeous get. $205, nothing wrong with that either.   So, as I ate, I played some internet poker late last night, about 3:30 my time. I figure I'm one of the few sober ones, so I always try to play a while after work. Got almost nothing 3 times around the table, $2/4. I was down about $25, so I figured I'd play until the blind, then leave. So, last hand, I'm dealt a 33. The table had been raising often pre-flop, and it did, to the max. I reluctantly went along, as 2 pair usually a winning hand, so I knew they'd bid up anything.   The flop came x33. I knew it was mine, as I had a flush and a full house beat. I called, and 2 others raised it to the max. 5 of us were still in. I don't know what the next two cards were, except there were three clubs, and 2 10's total. 3 of us remained after the river, both bid before me, so I raised for the first time. One of 'em raised again, so I called. I knew only one hand could beat me, a pair of 10's. The mad raiser's cards turned, um, a 10 and a 6? Who the hell raises twice pre-flop with a 10/6 suited? $114 pot, I think. I was too busy wondering why this guy was still in, as I'd never stay in with that, with raising like that. I just took my money and ran. I deposited $2500 late last year, and I now sit at $6792, a new high for me. Yes, they gave me a bonus, but I've still more than doubled that. And I honestly don't think I'm very good.   Thanks for the visits and comments. Talk to you later, friends.   ___________________________________________________

      Yeah, Timberwolves!!!!!!  I'm so happy, I'm even having a Game 2 party Sunday night.  Many of the managers will be able to make it, and I have a few buddies that do not take off their clothes for a living.  I spent the last couple hours making invites, and I plan to deliver them all tomorrow, which will mean a lot of driving, but will also mean I can rest up Friday and Saturday having seen everyone already.    After all, I got a party to buy stuff for.

      Lost about $125 yesterday at Canterbury, finished up about 6, went to Taco Bell and ate dinner, and didn't really know what to do with myself.  TWolves play Game 7 tonight, and the Brewers are not on DIRECT until Friday.  So, not feeling like a movie, I went to Mystic Lake and won $400 playing blackjack.  I don't think I've ever had a session like that.  I think the dealer busted 8 hands in a row, and I think I won 12-14 hands in a row.  I was very aggressive doubling down, twice I doubled a 9 with a crappy up card, and both times, I got a 2, but won when the dealer busted.    Still home early, slept well.  No phone call this AM, so it's all good.

      I was rudely awakened by the phone ringing this morning at 7AM.  My boss is an early riser, and runs to the computer to check the previous night's numbers in his boxers.  I was his lowest DM in average concession sales last night, so he called to ask why.  Of course, like I know.  I asked him where it was for the week, and he said I was 4th (out of 8).  I paused, he was silent, so I asked, "So why am I on the phone with you?"  The key to my happiness is knowing that if I get fired tomorrow, I'll be fine.  I have money in the bank, no kids, and the ability to make cash by acting slutty.  Screw 'em.  So, unable to finish my dream with Evan Marriot trying desperately to seduce me (like he'd have to try for long), I went onto Party Poker.  I just got done playing, finished up just under $60.  Of course, on my 4th or 5th hand, I won a $41 pot with a 2 over 3 full house.  I was in the big blind, they called to me, so I checked.    K-J-2 on the flop.  Only a $1 to call, so I did.  2 on the turn.  I raised and was called.  3 on the river, also the 3rd diamond.  I raised and raised again, maxing out.  Only one remained, I assumed flush, as the only hand that could beat me was 3-3.    I was up $40 after a couple hours, so I jumped up to the $2/4 table and just finished playing there.  Without that one hand, I'd have barely finished up.  One card can make all the difference.    I'm spending much of my day off at Canterbury.  I'll be the one wearing a low-cut top and a devilish smile.  Say hi if you see me.

      Pat is on the road, heading back to base.  I was wondering if I should go back and scratch off a couple of the items on my list...:)  OK, we are officially a "couple".  Two things pushed me over the edge, as I had told him several times I had little interest in a long distance relationship, nor little interest in being an Air Force wife.  So, it seemed stupid to do the short-term dating thing and have no desire to do the long-term relationship thing.    One, as cliched as it sounds, he's just a nice guy.  "Let me throw my jacket over that puddle for you, my dear" nice.  My folks loved him.  I enjoyed every minute I was with him.  Two, at the wedding reception Saturday night, Pat wore his uniform.  Yes, men in uniform look hot.  But, people were drawn like a magnet to him.  Little kids, single women, and men of all ages.  Several people just shook his hand and said "thank you".  It almost made me cry, especially when elderly gentlemen had someone push them across the room to do so.  I've never hung around an athlete or an actress, but it can't be much more of a combination pain/cool thing.    I actually enjoyed his family thing, I met Nadia's "f***ing ex" that she refers to, and she is a handful.  Pat tells her so, as does everyone else.  She's actually quite pretty, but high maintenance doesn't begin to describe her.  I think I heard her complain about 44 things in a few hours.  Both his parents and extended family are very polite and cordial.  Not to be mean, but I think they were excited to see him with a girl.:)  So, the plan is to see if we continue to get along, maybe get together once a month or so for a weekend.  And, it's not like it will cramp my style, as freedom will be the least of my concern.    Sorry about the 2 of 3  AGAIN  Aaron.  Still love ya.

      Not sure how it came up, but Pat and I are driving to Milwaukee today to watch the Brewers game, and in Pat's case, meet my parental units.  Nothing like a 5 hour drive to get to know someone better.:)  My dad is a season ticket holder, and exchanged a couple of unused tickets for our seats today, as he will be attending as well.  Pat is more looking forward to seeing Miller Park, as he has no rooting interest in the game.    FYI, for many of my loyal readers of the male gender, Victoria's Secret is having a huge sale, and it is in your best interest, for a couple reasons, to get your lady friend something, or a gift card.  As a proud preferred VS shopper, we like to wear them as much as you like to take them off.    Back soon, bye-bye.

      Had a nice weekend.  Good couple nights of work, my Party Poker account now stands at $10500, and my airman still has interest.  Things are looking nice.  Oh, and the scale at the health club said 127 this morning.  Sure, water weight, blah, blah.  It is nice when the scale tells me that I must look as good as I feel.   This weekend I actually have Saturday off from "dancing", as I have a wedding to attend, one of my out of town theaters assistants.  I will visit the theater about noon, so I can claim it as work and claim the miles, then the wedding is at 2.  I'm not much of a reception person, as I don't drink, so I'm not sure if I'll attend that or not.  Then, Sunday is Pat's "going away" party, sort of a family reunion they usually schedule around his leave.  I have been asked to attend it, so it appears as if I'll "meet the parents".    Pat and I talked on the phone for a long time last night, and I admit, it's just cool "finding a niche" with a normal, respectable guy, who seems to feel the same way.  He told me last night (and Nadia verified) he hasn't really had a "girlfriend" in several years, just a date here and there.  He is quiet and his habits don't really lend themselves to social life...as is the case with myself.  So, he agreed to go to the wedding with me, so that makes the as of yet untalked about Saturday night sleeping arrangements up in the air.  It's hardly that I'm unwilling (in fact, sounds like fun:), but I know he's not the type to do that and then not be in a relationship when he leaves a week from today. That's really what we talked about mostly last night.  We'll be 4 hours away, but that isn't THAT bad.  He has no problem with me continuing to moonlight, though he admits if we "become serious" it would be tougher to accept.  I told him I would much prefer us to not be in a committed thing, as it's not like I'll be dating 5 nights a week anyway.  He's a good guy, and he just seems to want a chance.  I'm happy to give him one, but he's trying so hard, it's difficult not to like him.  As I said to him, I'm very much in like with him.  He'll be up tomorrow, and I promised not to drag him to poker.  It sure is a shame the Twins lost 2 of 3 to my Brewers!! Such a pity!!  Too bad I'm busy all weekend, as the Brewers are here then.  I had planned to go to both the Sat/Sun games, but I now have plans for both days.  And, I work Friday night.  Ta ta, see you soon.

      25 Things I Learned About Pat   1. He almost joined the military after high school, but decided not to because people talked him out of it.  Had he, he'd be 3 years away from his 20 years, so, listen to yourself, not others.  2. Has served in Korea, and "at an undisclosed location" in the recent Iraq skirmish.

      Lost about $360 Tuesday, although I hear I looked sexy doing it.:)    Today, once again with an audience, I went in with $1000 and walked out with $2150.  A remarkable day in which I just got good cards and also felt very confident.  My last hand I played was a huge win, almost like the climatic hand in Rounders.  I stayed in with a 7/8 suited in the small blind, and the flop came 5/6/9, rainbow.  I checked and watched the table bet to me, and then raised, 2 others stayed in.  One stayed in with me 'til the end, with 2 pair A high.  Won a $250 pot, and announced that I was going home.    I will do a "25 Things About Pat" (I prefer that to Junior, and about 25% of people call him that) tomorrow or the next day.  We got along nicely both Tuesday and today, and he was very polite, friendly, and...I don't know, comfortable???  He's so easy going and low maintenance, such a nice guy.  I think much of it is simply he is older and not used to attracting "younger" women, as he is so attentive.    I'm out, talk to you soon.

      So, Sunday night I went to a little housewarming for one of my co-workers at the club.  "Nadia" is one of my best friends there, she also just works Fri/Sat, and she has been there just a couple months longer than myself.  She's 29 and recently got married to a fella who can accept she strut naked.  He's divorced, as Nadia is, and they bought an older house in one of the good sections of Mpls. They hope to do the whole "fix it up" thing, and good for them.    I caught the eye of an older friend of her hubby, who was dressed in a casual Air Force outfit.  He seemed nice, though he appeared to be about 42-45, so, you know, he's like 20 years older than me.  We talked and he was fun and polite.  He spoke once of being "married to the Air Force", so I assumed he didn't have the baggage of a previous marriage.  I actually thought to myself, it's too bad this guy is so damn old.    So, around 11:30, as I was getting ready to go home to bed, Nadia's husband Mike said, "Anyone up for Mystic Lake"?  For those of you not in our little corner of the world, ML is the casino closest to the Twin Cities.  I rarely go there, although blackjack is a fun game to play for an hour or so.  Nadia said she was happy to go, but most folks said they had to work the next morning.  The old airman said he didn't have anywhere to be until June 29th, so he was game.  I thought, why not, so we took 2 cars, as I live in the other direction.  For whatever reason, we split so me and Nadia drove together, though the AF guy volunteered to ride with me.  So, as soon as we were on the road, Nadia says, "He asked about you".  So, we talked, and he's actually Mike's former brother-in-law, the brother to his ex-wife.  He is an Air Force officer, currently stationed in Grnad Forks, ND.  He plans to retire after his 20 years, she said.  I also asked his name, as I'd never caught it.  Turns out he goes by Junior, as he is named after his dad, Patrick.  Said he was a very good guy, a reader and had never been in a serious relationship as far as she had heard.    So, I was intrigued.  Heck, I was doing the math in my head, and figured he must be close to retirement.  Suddenly, he was appealing.  Older men have always impressed me as being more mature and the like.  Having a retired fella making good money sitting around seemed cool.:)  So, I asked if he was close to retirement, and Nadia says, "Yeah, 11 years".  Turns out he joined in '95...and that he's just prematurely gray.  He's only 35.  Just when I accepted the fact he was ancient, he's not that old.  Irony.  So, we played for a couple hours, I doubled my $500 to just over $1000, then had $900 when it was announced Mike & Nadia wanted to go.  Wanting to leave with a profit, I bet $300, after having been betting $25-100 all night.  Of course, I ended up splitting 9's against the dealer's 5, and won one while busting the other.  So, deciding to leave with at least $200 extra, I bet $200, lost, and took my money to the cashier.  Mike and Nadia just wanted to go home, but I wanted to eat, and Junior said he would happily join me.  So, we went to Perkins and I had a yummy seafood plate, and we shared an appetizer sampler as well.  He complimented me and said how much he hated a girl that picks at her food.  We talked and had a good time, and then I had to take him back to Nadia's as he was staying there, so I had to drive across the city, and dropped him off at 5ish. His family lives in Mankato, so that's where he's staying for much of his leave.    Nadia called me Monday and asked how things went, and said Junior just kept saying how awesome I was, and that he didn't know if he should pursue it, since I was so young and attractive.  Ding, ding, ding.  We have ourselves a winner.  He was on his way back, but we plan to have lunch at 1 today and we might head to our friendly poker club.  He's never played except in college for nickel and dime stakes, so he'll probably just watch.  He hates the Lakers as much as I do (who doesn't hate LA?), so we might watch the game tonight, if all goes well. And possibly the best part, he knows I strip.  No awkward pause after that little bomb is revealed.  I must admit, it's really cool choosing clothes to wear for a guy, rather than for me.

      Slower at work last night.  Needs more yuppies who enjoy the athletic girl.:)  Played online for a couple hours last night.  That's the way I remember late nites online, easy victories over total morons.  Won about $500, back up to $8395.    I'm going to call all my theaters today and call it a day.  6-2 this evening, I need a nap.    Won $100 at Canterbury Tuesday, lost several hands on the river.  Making me mad.  I was, however, asked out by a guy who seemed pretty genuine.  He played at my table for my first hour, then waited two hours for me to complete my playing.  I turned him down, but I did take his number.  He said he was a day trader...that's about as low as you can get, the stripper and the day trader.  I must admit, he talked politely and looked me right in the eyes.  He made a good first impression.    Calls and sleepy time.

      I can't believe it's been so long since I last posted.  I could have sworn I posted Friday, but I guess not, huh?    So, I stepped on the scale at the athletic club today, and it said 129.  That's as light as I've been in quite a while.  Must be the constant workouts, at both clubs.  I know it isn't the diet, as I eat like crap.  If only low cal/low carb tasted like Taco Johns and Davannis.    Made over $700 in two nights last weekend.  The last couple weekends have been as busy as I can remember.  The house fund now officially has over $70K in it.  It's been close for a while, but you know, $65K is a lot of jiggling away from $70K.  I had 2 "repeaters" on Saturday from Friday, which builds the confidence level immensely.  Of course, it makes me wonder about if I have a stalker.     My balance has gone down to $8300 or so online.  Seems like I'm taking a lot of bad beats of late.  And, you'd think by playing late at night, you'd run into a lot of drunks and idiots, but the opposite seems to be the case with me.     I feel like Canterbury is going to suffer my wrath tomorrow, damn it.  If you're there at an $8/16 table, look out.

      My feet still hurt.  30 hours in heels...what was I thinking?  Live and learn I guess.  I skipped my workout this AM and just went into the whirlpool.  Stayed for 45 minutes, went in the sauna for 15-20, then back into the whirlpool for 30 more.  I sweat a lot, so that should count for something.    Skipped Canterbury today as well, just didn't feel like being around men (or people in general).  I'm watching the Brewers on Direct tonight.  I overheard some folks at the athletic club today saying how hard the Woves played and what a good game it was.  Good for them.    My old botfriend called tonight.  There's a lot of history there, and I often think we'll still end up together.  We lived together for over a year back when I was still in the Milwaukee area, and dated for over 18 months.    He's just an all around good guy, works hard, lives clean, fun to be around.  He works for an electronics retailer (based up here, strangely enough) and met a fellow trainee and for whatever reason, became infatuated with her.  I met her, she was plenty cute (chesty), and quiet, somehow mesmerizing, I guess.  It was ackward, as we were living together, and one night it was over.  He had been very good to me, insisting that I live in his condo rent free, and also insisting I bank all the money I'd been paying for rent, so I had $15K just sitting around.  That was the beginning of my poker fund, actually.:)  He also gave me 45 days to move out, as he announced the "breakup" mid-month.    I moved in with Missy, who was his former roomie actually, and who also worked as an (ahem) "dancer".  I often shook my head when she told me stuff, though admittedly, there was some curiousity in my head then.  Missy had made a small fortune, as she had been doing it for 5 years then, and the ex always invested it for her, wisely and safely.  I know I saw a Strong statement lying around once that said $240K...pretty good for a 23 year-old whose only talent was looking fine naked (oh, and she did).  She actually did some travelling, for conventions, and such.  Went to Mardi Gras one year to work at a establishment of some merit.  Then, a few months later, I took a job up here.  He calls once a month or so, and we've come close to getting together a few times, but we never do.  Of course, I have never told him of my moonlighting, and that simply could not continue, though it wouldn't in many relationships.  As forward thinking as many guys are, they know I get felt up (groped actually is more descriptive), and it's just tough for them.  Often, I just let it go to voice mail.  I miss him, and it's tough being serious about love and stuff after that.  He was honest with me every step of the way, and stuff happens.  They had decided not to pursue a serious relationship before I had even moved, so that hasn't hung over us at all.    The really crappy thing is that it depends on someone else.  I hate depending on someone else for my happiness.  Hate it.  Even if things are smooth and good, there's always that wandering eye and admittedly, I've behaved badly when I was younger as well.  You know, kind of dating, not exclusive, temptation hits, do you really say no because you went to a movie with Tad last Friday?    Lots of questions, and you never have all the answers, do you?

      I'm going to try and take a few minutes to update folks on things.&nbsp;   Yes, I lied to the airport gal to get my return flight changed to Grand Forks.&nbsp; They didn't have to do it, as I had non refundable tickets, but they didn't bat an eye.&nbsp; Happy to help the customer. No harm, no foul, as the flight to Grand Forks was all but empty.&nbsp;   So, after making a surpise visit to see Pat, he returned the favor this weekend, though it was planed.&nbsp; He was off Friday-Sunday, as he'd worked 11 days in a row, so he drove&nbsp;here Thursday night.&nbsp; He left about 3 this afternoon, all satisfied.:) Yes, I did work the last two nights, but all things considered, life is a lot better when you have someone waiting for you.&nbsp; He visited family&nbsp;last night, as i worked a long shift.&nbsp; All in all, a very nice 2+ days.&nbsp;   I think I lost some money in Vegas, but as I said, I really didn't play much poker.&nbsp; I was involved in 2 hands which were memorable.&nbsp;   In one 20/40 hand, I was the big blind, and was dealt an 8/9 suited.&nbsp; One player raised, and since everyone else folded, I stayed in, as I've been playing more "suited connectors" and have had some luck at it.&nbsp; I was hesitant to do so, because I feel it's easy to lose to a higher flush.&nbsp; But, I still don't recall that happening.&nbsp; I am amazed how many people will ignore my signs that i have them beat, and reraise me, then turn over high pair to my straight.&nbsp; Anyway, the flush came 8/8/9.&nbsp; I checked, he bet, I raised, he reraised, and in doing so, ran out of chips.&nbsp; Thus, he was all-in, and we turned over our hands.&nbsp; He had A/A, so only an A would save him.&nbsp; On the turn came an A.&nbsp; The hand was all but over...until the 8 came on the river.&nbsp; Incredibly lucky, and I could only imagine how much I would have won had he not ran out of money.&nbsp;   The next day, I was flopped a K/K.&nbsp; I bet hard, and was called by 2.&nbsp; The flop came Kd/Qd/9s.&nbsp; Again, I bet hard, thinking I was against a flush/straight.&nbsp; The turn, 9c.&nbsp; Full house, I was unbeatable, except to a 9/9.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was maxed out by one other player.&nbsp; I was thinking straight, or possible full house,&nbsp;but under me.&nbsp; The river, 10d.&nbsp; Again, we maxed out.&nbsp; I was watching for him to turn over a pair of 9's, but instead, he had J/9...both diamonds.&nbsp; He had been betting the 3 9's, with a straight/flush draw, and had rivered a straight flush.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was so shocking it barely hurt like those bad beats always do.&nbsp;&nbsp;   My internet balance is sitting at $17932.&nbsp; Haven't played much the past few days, as I've been "busy".&nbsp; I think it's much easier online, as folks act like it's not real money.&nbsp; Still not nearly as much fun as the table, though it's nice not having to dress up and act seductively.&nbsp; I have started "slow-playing" when I have a great hand, waiting a long time to call, and it seems to work every time.&nbsp; How dumb are thses people?   The movie biz is doing fine, yet another summer in which all bemoan the lack of quality, and then records are set.&nbsp; Bourne Identity did $50+ million, though Catwoman disappointed.&nbsp; Hey, I'm as hetero as they come, and I think Halle Berry is gorgeous.&nbsp; I still remember her topless shot in...that movie, computer hacking, with Travolta.&nbsp; If I had those, I'd make so much more...but, of course, I'd be stupid.:) Just kidding, breast size has nothing to do with intelligence, regardless of the many examples we can give to prove otherwise.   Once again, allow me to thank yuppie men in their mid 20's for having bachelor parties.&nbsp; I just look for the polo shirts and khaki shorts and wait for the cash to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, things pick up about 10/11 or so, after the Twins' game ends, but they must be on the road this weekend, as the "rush" never materialized either night.&nbsp; Still, with the help of some fellas from AmEx (apparently, the market isn't doing that badly, despite&nbsp;what my 401K statement says), it was a $500 evening, and that's about as good as it gets, for us with non-Halle Berry chests, of course.&nbsp;:)&nbsp;   So, this morning, Pat and I went to MOA to get some Krispy Kremes (worth every calorie), and i threw on a tank top and shorts.&nbsp; As we were walking threw the mall, Pat said he always wanted to date a girl who could "wear a tank top like that".&nbsp; I'm not even sure what he meant, but I'm sure it was a compliment!  Thanks for coming back, and remember to comment!!!&nbsp; See ya soon.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      A hearty hello to all my loyal, frustrated readers.&nbsp; I returned from Sin City via North Dakota (I am a sneaky young woman) last Thursday.&nbsp; Enjoyed my trip a lot, though I really only played about 12 hours of poker.&nbsp; Spent a couple hours at The Bellagio Monday night, took part in a couple hands which i will have to document at some point.&nbsp; But, for the most part, I simply relaxed.&nbsp; I found a site the other day that lets you stay with monks for 3-7 days, and it costs more than my trip, so I don't feel too bad.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So, I was sneaky and told a small fib the morning of my departure, and was happily routed to North Dakota.

      So, I arrived safely in Vegas at about 10:30 local time here last night.  I was "working" today, called all my theaters, plugged in the ol' laptop and checked all the numbers, talked to all about pushing their concessions, etc.  It's supposed to be hot and humid this weekend in the Cities, so I told them to lower the temp on all the coolers and fridges...nothing better to a customer than getting that bottled water or juice and having it be  ice cold .    I am here for two things, poker and to spoil myself.  I got a suite with its own whirlpool for only $79 a night, so I'm reading, relaxing, and getting ready to head out for weekend action...of the hold 'em variety, of course.:)  Sadly, I'll still check the sales and such each morning, but the calls are done until next Thursday, when I return.  We'll see if my $2500 cash bankroll and $2500 in traveler's checks are enough.  While I'd love to say I'm hoping to find a bunch of out-of-town rubes, I'm just hoping I'm not the rube.

      As I watch the ESPN poker that was on last night, a thought comes to me.  You see some women, and quite a few Asian-Americans.  Where are the black poker players?  I see them at Canterbury, but not many.  Seems strange.

      Played an online tourney the other night after work, $200 entry fee, won $1200 for coming in 18th out of 475.  My balance is up to an all-time high of $14,836.    I made $400+ on Monday night...and I must admit, I gave one fella more than he asked for.  He's a regular, and always is very polite and kind.  7/5 seems like an odd night for a bachelor party, but there were several taking place.    Went to Spidey 2 today, good.  I still think Kristen Dunst is all wrong for the part as "the girl next door", but that's a minor quibble.    I'm thinking of doing something very exciting and spontaneous tomorrow, but we'll see.  Can you call it spontaneous if you think about it overnight?  We'll see, already got Vegas happening Thursday night through next Wednesday.

      The Russian gal that won Wimbledon today, pretty, but nothing like Anna Kournikova.  She is so skinny.  Anna had curves.   Of course, I've never really liked tall girls.  And, I'm not really her main demographic.:)

      So, about 4 yesterday, I doublecheck my schedule to make sure I have to be at work at 8...and I see I not only work tonight, but 6-close the 4th and 5th as well.  I vaguely remember signing up for that, as several women wanted to have the weekend off.  Plus, with my trip to Vegas next weekend, it made it easier to make up that lost money, and show what a team player I am.  I was surprised how busy it was last night, as I thought many of our regulars would be up at the cabin or doing family things.  Of course, we went from steady to busy about 11-11:30...lemme see, kids go to bed at 10 or 10:30...hmmm.  Lots of offers for "extras" last night, as well, which are not legal, and extremely against the rules.  Not saying I've never accepted a "tip" for some minor fondling, but I was offered $150 and $250 last night to "meet them after work".  Um thanks, but the line between being a hooker and a stripper not a thin one.  Played some poker online when I got home, 'til 5:30.  That 8AM alarm came mighty early this morning.  I'm sitting at about 11K in my online account, down from 12.5 a week ago.  I had a bad stretch, just like I had a good one before.  I've been playing $200/250 one table tourneys, which pays about half the total pot to the winner, and gives 3rd back the entry fee.  For the most part, the week I did so well, I laid back and let folks go all-in.  Often, the table would be down to 5-6 players by the time the blinds got to me.  Then, lately, the table has been extremely conservative early on, finally I figured out I could steal a lot of pots by betting aggressively.  I've also come to find that I am one of the very few players that use the "check and raise" method to suck people in, let them think they have the best hand, then riase them all-in at some point.  Sure, I win some smaller pots if they don't have a hand at all, but if I have KQ, and the flop is KQx, I'll check and call, as if they have a K, Q, or x in their hand, they will often bid, thinking I'm weak.  Once in a while, I'll suffer a bad beat, when I easily could have had the blinds by raising, but it seems to work far more often than not.  Since I've been "not playing conservatively", I'm doing nicely again.    Pat and I have been e-mailing daily and talking on the phone "semi-daily" to quote George Costanza.  As I was putting together my numbers for my 9AM conference call, he called to say good morning.  He went out to play darts after he got done with work at 10, and one girl he was interested in, but engaged, was suddenly single, and acted very interested.  Then, just before he left at 11:30, one of her friends came in, another attractive young lady who often came in with her husband.  Pat prefers his girls "unskinny" ("womanly", he would say), and this lady is separated and her divorce will be final soon.  She is not a pro-military type, but was hitting on every guy in her sight, and told her friend the marraige fell apart because she wasn't a size 4.  Pat doesn't really know women's sizes, but said he would say she was a size 8-10, and "very busty", and volunteered he'd have no complaints.  Then, as he drove into his driveway, a co-worker of his drove in seconds later (same apartment complex), with his college age girlfriend.  So, he was already kinda down about the distance thing, though he made sure I knew he is not looking and remains loyal.  I have very little doubt about that, as I'd be shocked if he cheated, as he is mature and is not looking for a fling.  He made it known he is serious about finding a lifelong companion, as he's had plenty of dates and liasons.  I must admit, that uniform does wonders, and to be blunt, many young women aren't all that particular even if they haven't been drinking.    Won another tourney while typing this up, I'm at 11.7K at this second.   Forgot to mention that Spidey2 did more than all other movies combined yesterday.  That happens a few times each year, but still amazes me.  Also, in the past week, I've sent gift cards to over a dozen people now, evry one of them upset at what a total piece of crap Fareheit 911 is.  One lady told me she wasn't a fan of Bush, but now thinks anyone that Moore supports has to be worse.  Another said she walked out after 30 minutes, because she lost track of the lies...and also claimed to be a non-Bush supporter, but said the fairness level was just insane.  Many said they went to see it as unabashed Republicans, and said it was like a fictional account.  I will say this: I am not political, and at best, I would say this is an extremely slanted version of the truth.  Moore would make me out to be a call girl because I accepted $100 once and let a customer caress my breasts for 60 seconds.  I actually think one of the Bush supporters summed it up well, when he said: "I was expecting a load of crap, but it outcrapped my lowest expectations".  The thing that irritates me is that Moore knows he's lying (or stretching/hiding the truth), but he does it anyway.  I supported the war, though I wondered about the exit strategy...and still do.      I think a nap is in order before work.  Bye for now.

      So, I'm watching Razz on ESPN with Dutch Boyd, and I truly have no idea if he's ever got laid in his life.  I cannot imagine a woman not looking at him and going, "What an incredible nerd."  I'm sorry, I've heard the rumor he's gay, and bless him if he is, but this idiot hangs out with other young frat boy types and wears a hankie on his head.  If he's gay, you'd expect more fashion sense, and if he's straight, get a clue.   Also, allow me to say, every time I see him, he makes errors at the table I never make.

      Iggy talks about Dutch Boyd and  urlLink his sordid past . I was unaware of this, though I doubt if it is possible to hate he and his "crew" any more than I already do. That Fishman fella has to be one of the stupidest human beings on the planet. He acts as if he is responsible for the massive luck that brought him his title.  Also, Phil Hellmuth has to be one of the most arrogant folks anywhere. "If luck wasn't involved, I guess I'd win them all". Um, yeah.

      My Party account is all messed up, as I'm unable to play sit and go tourneys, which is the easiest money to be made short of stripping.  My balance is sitting at $21.2K.  The hands these idiots raise with is just mind-boggling.  Twice yesterday, I flopped a set, one in my hand and two on the board, and was capped out by some idiot who had the other card in his hand.  Hey, I understand calling, but raising after your opponent shows obvious strength?  Pat is off this weekend, but he's not planning on visiting.  He just wants to relax, and the fact i work 8-2 tonight and 6-2 tomorrow doesn't leave a lot of time for us.  Granted, it would be "quality" time, but i have no problem with it.  I am far beyond having someone who is dependent on me for an activity.  One day he is doing that thing where you try and locate a thing out in the woods using GPS, which I might like to do once, but that'd be plenty.  I'm not a bug person.  He is in a paintball league in the Spring, but it ends in early June, as guys start taking leave and vacation.  I do think that would be cool, as shooting stuff seems like a fun time.   And he did start an online account, as he tries to learn poker, or at my level, I mean.  He plays a "pretend" tourney most nights, and came in 47th out of 450 one night, so he may be getting the hang of it.  He's been avoiding no-limit, as he doesn't know when to risk it all and when not to.  But, it's tough to find no-limit in a casino anyway.   I'm going to nap before work.  Bye for now.

      After a 9 hour stretch of online poker, my new balance is $19035.  If I've ever been over $19K before, I've forgotten.   Geez, I gotta get a life.  Pat called at 6 or so and I told him I'd call him back, as I was head-to-head at the conclusion of a sit-and-go.  After winning that, after being down 19-1 at one point (i think I had $180 and he had $3820), i continued on, taking a break to go get Subway.  About 10:15 I said, "I never called Pat!".   I am a bad, bad girlfriend.  Bad.   I played last night, and forgot to watch Six Feet Under, so I had to catch it tonight on HBO2. I think its having a down season.  I am really sick of dead people getting more airtime than living cast members.     Need to shut monitor off and go outside, don't I?
