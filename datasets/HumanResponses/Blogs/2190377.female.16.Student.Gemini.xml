       It's eleven, I have a fever, and have studied a grand total of one hour for three tests.  Oh Boy. Why can't Thursday be over? I think I'm going to head home early because I don't feel like taking my German exam. Lalala. My pain medicine will have worn out by then.  Moo  That's all I have to say, and if I said anything weird to you today, it's 'cause I do REALLY weird things when I'm feverish... Seriously.  I've got strange numbers running around in my head *sigh*.  We're talking: 6.63 * 10^-34 J sec ... -2.18 *10^-18J (z^2/n^2)  -313.6/n^2 109678/cm (1/n1^2-1/n2^2) Lyman Balmer Paschen Bracket Pfund 1s2 s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2  3d10  That's just chem! weeeee  Then there's AP bio, which I know nothing about.  I know like two words that pertain to crap on the test.  Oxaloaceate and Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. lalalala That's the extent of my knowledge. Ok. Maybe not.  I also know crap about carotenoids, which, coincidentally make me think of Carrot Top. I'm going to explode  bye now

       I need go-go boots very badly.  Give me go-go boots. now  As of now my halloween costume consists of: white mini-dress with bold neon orange and pink stripes, chunky white gaudy plastic necklace and clip-on earrings (sad, I know, one of my many goals in life is to get at least four piercings as soon as I turn eighteen), opaque tights of some kind or another, and fake eyelashes. All I need is a huge headband and go-go boots, *sigh*  In other news, my grades continue to make no sense, now that I've aced the last four things I got back in chem, and got Cs on everything in Bio.  I'm hoping that the ADD test dealie says there IS something wrong with me, just so I know it can be fixed......... lalala   Anyways, I cut my hair, and everyone says it makes me look like an eighth grader, even the supposedly devoted boyfriend is less than thrilled.  All this animosity towards my hair is urging me to screw it up even moreso, just as a protest of sorts you know? So this means, dye it snot green and get a pseudo mohawk. I'm sure the guys would just flock to me.  I've noticed that guys have no taste in girls, what's up with that? They pick these really ugly ones, and also decide to like me, so by process of association, I am offended.  Especially when people have really weird old crushes or exes... it makes me wonder if I fit into the category of bad taste girls.    I say that I'm smart but people just think I'm a moron, but judging from what I just wrote, maybe they're right.  lalala  This was a stupid post. yaaaaaaaaay

       I'm not exactly sure what to do with this thing now that I've got it.  I think I'll just complain :) lalala So recently, I've noticed that there are five recurring jokes in my WHOLE life.  Five. They are: 1. Ashleigh is a big slut. 2. Ashleigh is a lesbian. 3. Ashleigh has no friends. 4. Ashleigh is a dumb blonde.  Unfortunately, I managed to combine the last two (see how there are only four? ohhh ahahhahaha yea now you get it) while on the phone with Carisa and Matt (a conversation mostly about them calling me a lesbian slut... :P). Of course this warrants a "Wow Ashleighs is such a dumb blonde joke."   I think that instead of actually saying it, people should just come up to me and say the number corresponding to the joke or, if they're really in the mood to slam me "One hundred twenty-four!!! ohhhhhhhh haahahahaha".  It would save us all a lot of time.    Now my quest in life is to find more jokes, so maybe I could get ten or so, just to spice things up.

       After much boredom and isolation, I've decided to run through the numerous exciting (read: fucking messed up) events of the past few weeks for my ever faithful readers.  Who the hell actually reads this? REALLY?  Oh well.  So far, I've: lost best friend of five years, screwed relationship with boyfriend of six months to point of no return--via aforementioned lost friend (messy situation, I've probably already told you anyways), single-handedly destroyed my academic career, been told my recent ADD test scores were so bad I scored lower than 99.5% of people that took it, been told I'm not going to be medicated yet because my brain waves are abnormal and medication may f*** me up even more, gotten seriously ill, played basketball with 100 fever, lost voice to the point where my sexuality would be questioned by strangers, blown off at least half a dozen friends, lost seven pounds, and had three close friends tell me they would jump my bones were retarded boyfriend not to exist.    You try and swallow all that when you're so weak you can barely walk up the stairs.     Not that I'm bitter or resentful of anything.  Heavens forbid.  So, tell me about your life. Oh, you feel as if I've been ignoring you? I'm so sorry, I'm such a selfish person, how could I have put my needs before yours? Next time my life falls to pieces I'll drop everything so I can support you.  I realize what a sensitive person you are.  And your life is just so tough. You poor thing...  Wow.  I'm a regular basketcase.  Just so you know, that wasn't directed at anyone that actually reads this, except maybe Jeremy. haha. hahahahahaha.  I hate my life.  Die bitches.   Happy Thanksgiving!!  -_-

       Turkey day is a good excuse to get out of school.  My grades suck.  Apparently I have really bad ADHD.  We're talking three standard deviations away from the norm.  I have too many clothes.  Karin makes good cheesecake.  Elf is a funny movie.  Andrew looks a whole lot like Ed, stretched out.  Andrew now weighs 141 pounds.  I'm very proud.  Writing disjointed sentences is entertaining.  My life sucks, but it's getting better.  I'm terrible at basketball.  I've grown half an inch since last time I was measured.    WAhoo  My butt, however, is still dead.  It needs to be resurrected.  Goodbye

       I haven't wrote in this for awhile... but then again I've also had one of the worst weeks of my life! :)  I've been sick since Wednesday night.  Too bad I went to school both Thursday AND Friday.  Never play in a basketball scrimmage when you have a 100 degree fever, ok?  Anyways, being sick has made me realize the best skeezy quick-fix diet plan ever.  You know how they have those things you drink that basically make you throw up all weekend? Well, I figure, we can send these people food that I've coughed all over or something lol. That way, they'll get the flu, their tummyswill fill up with mucus and their throat will hurt too to swallow anything besides jello! End result: knock off a few pounds. I'm surprised someone hasn't thought of this sooner.  My butt is officially deceased.   I got two catalogs in the mail yesterday. One, American Girl Doll, the other Victoria's Secret. hahahahahaha   anyways. I'm still feverish, so don't pay attention to anything I wrote.

       k me and matt we were going to walmart it was about 11 o clock at night cuz we wanted some doritos and tootsie rolls, i dont know my matt wanted tootsie rolls but he did.  so we go in grab our doritos and tootsie rolls. and then this guy whose about 6 foot tall and probally weighing about 300 starts to follow us. so we started walking all around to try to lose him but he keeps following us. matt turns around and matt said "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT STOP FOLLOWING US!!!!" and the man said "im soo sorry, its.. ( he begins to cry) you look like my son who died yesterday in a car wreck." and matt being the nice guy he is was like im so sorry i wish i could make it up to you its just that you kinda freaked us out.  so me and matt walk around alittle bit to make sure he doesnt keep following us. we get to the register and hes right in front of us and we try not to notice him but he starts talking to matt how right before his son drove off he got in a fight with his son and he never got a chance to say bye. can you say bye dad its my fault and ill say bye son no im sorry about it. and matt still feeling bad said sure. so matt says bye dad its my fault and the guy says bye son im sorry about it. we check out and the cashier says that will be $334.43!!! we were like no your wrong and she said no im right his dad said youse would pay.. and im like quick call the cops.  and i run out there and start yelling at the guy why you do that that not right and hes like man i gotta feed my family and hes throwing in like snickers and milky ways and junk food and i try to grab him to stop him but hes bigger than me so he throws me on the ground and starts kicking me in the legs and the ribs matt came cuz he saw this out the front window of walmart he comes knocks the guy off me and has him on the ground and i start pulling his leg..... jsut like im pulling yours          (stole this from my buddy eric lol)

       That last entry was a cop-out lol.. oh well, I   Man.  Halloween may be my favorite holiday... but it made me gain five pounds.  Haaaaaaaah.  That's too bad. It's okay, though, because basketball starts MONDAY.  The end of my freedom. Forever........  blar  The bus rides have been fun while they lasted :D Today we played telephone.  It was made all the more interesting by the fact that Matt is almost deaf in one ear, as proven by those tests that make you take in driver's ed.  hehe. SOOOO! Chris Peterson starts "Ashleigh likes pink elephant nuts",  later turns into "Ashleigh licks pink elephant nuts" and by the time it gets to me it's turned into "Ashleigh charges nine cents a blow."  Obviously I was GREATLY offended by Chris :) So I changed it to his name, thinking that he was a dirty perv who started a naughty line.  He practically died when he heard the end result.    Ashleigh likes pink elephant nuts = Chris charges nine cents a blow  oh boy!!!  Time to start math project.  bye now

       I'm seriously wishing my dogs would stop having sex. RIGHT NOW.   In other news...  Thursday didn't suck too hard, Halloween was cool, Texas Chainsaw Massacre made me nearly pee my pants, and having bleach blonde crazy women place a couple dozen electrodes on your head while making small talk about your "long eyelashes" is more than a little disgruntling.  I should be reading 40 pages in my history book, but because I don't actually NEED to read it in order to get an A, I'll compile a list of desired video games games. Can you tell I like lists? I'm not sure why, especially because I'm not organized. at all.    p.s. Barney, my non-horny dog, likes carrots :)  lalala...oh yea  list  (all for ps2)  DDR 2, Karaoke Revolution, Kingdom of Hearts, FFX-2, and whatever the newest Spyro game is  I'm bored. Maybe I should read about the Foundations of Indian Society, 'cause hell, that'll wake me up

       WOW I haven't slept ALL week!!!! And I'm spectacularly hyper. I can't even write down all the things I'd wanna say.... weeee I went to bed at two yesterday, and woke up at seven by accident -_- But... that's okay! You know what's fun? Car crashes!! weeee. The other day on popeshead this car flipped over, and three busses got stuck on my two lane country road. HAWT. Cause Cause Cause.... I missed my connecter bus to TEe JaY and didn't have to take a sucky ass chem test!!! *dances*  Um.  Yea.  That and I have a 96 in AP Bio, a B+ in Chem... and other good-ish grades! German gingerbread cookies = yummy.  Kelly's "christmas present" was a lifesaver.  She is my angel.  HAha.  Assistive technology club is awesome but Luke needs to go to hell cause hes so good at drawing on the 'puter.  Can you tell I like writing down every thought that pops into my brain?   Now I'm having illicit thoughts.  I'm going to omit those.  I'm starting to love my hum (if only I didn't have a C+ for not turning in some stuff... *angel face*) Mrs. Robbins rocks, and even though Mrs. Martin is off her rocker I'm warming up to her too.  All we did today was discuss traditions... and I made myself look like SUCH a dork in front of fifty people.  SO much fun.  Then Jordan short boy took my balloon for maddie and let it float up to a place where noone could reach it.  At this point I went beserk and starting screaming obscenities about how i was going to eat the midget fetus freak for breakfast.  Turns out he was right around the corner :)  Apparently the kid took off as fast as he could.  Then Boris threw a shoe at it so I could grab it from the overhang.  Unfortunately, it also smacked me in the head.  Either way, my aggression carried over to my basketball game, where I tackled several people and pushed around a bunch of fat girls.  I totally owned all of them.  That and I actually got playing time.  What a great Christmas present Webber!! :D haha.  Oh man, Barbie girl was on our warmup tape.  That must be the magic thing that makes me play like someone 5'10" and like 160 pounds.  hahahahaha .... I played post.  Doesn't that make you laugh? Speaking of basketball, Maria B. is a hottie and I'm going to marry her.  She got me NASCAR nailclippers Christmas.... haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah oh man.  :)    btw.  JOSE R0x0rZ!!! He's my best kept secret.  that, and Rachel Miller is the most confusing girl on the planet.  And Matt deserves another kick in the shins...  heh...  that's all folks  virgogurl4: I HAVE A BIG CRUSH ON HIM virgogurl4: i mean virgogurl4: i dont virgogurl4: my fingers slipped virgogurl4: i meant to say virgogurl4: I LIKE TO CRUSH ORANGES ON HIM

       In the past two weeks, I have done NO homework at home.  What's funny, is that my grades haven't really suffered at all.  >=) I've done all my work in other classes... and I'm slipping by juuuust fine.  Maybe I should stop. Or not.  Yesterday I walk into driver's ed and Mr. Potoker says VERY loudly, "Even Ashleigh Allen does!"  Which prompts a "What do I do??!?!?!?!" him: "Oh. I just said that even you thrive under pressure on tests."   bwahahahaha.  definitely gotten B+s/As on his tests even though I sleep allllll the time :)  It was so great...  In math the other day I was pulling what I thought was a loose string off my red shirt... And Andrew Yang looks at it and goes, "But your shirt isn't white!!!! I don't get it!!!" in his silly Andrew Yang kinda voice right?  hehehe. Think about it.  Then he got all grossed out and talked about how I needed to duct-tape my bra together so it didn't come off.   Oh boy... Time to redo my chipped nails

       *felt like clearing out my profile*  it's nice having friends.  :)  That, and our basketball team is on a two game winning streak!!! w00t!.  You'd have to be on our team to understand how amazing that is.  I wish I was good at basketball, but no.  No more basketball for me after Feb. 13, kinda sad.  Maybe if I MAGICALLY become good over the summer I'll play next year but I seriously doubt it.  My brother thinks I should do winter track next year.  My brother is the coolest person ever.  However, I don't think I'll heed his advice.  If I'm this bonkers during sophomore year... next year could result in institutionalization.    Today I bought a CD at Mckay's, along with 4 or so gruesome vampire and/or  rampant infectious disease books.  CD = The Police - Every Breath you Take- "The Singles" *sigh* so good.  I find myself listening to a lot of singer song writer hooha lately, as well as waaay too much of The Cure, this band called Spoon that was on Rachel's mix for me, and random Christian music as introduced to me by Kelly.  The maturity level of my conversations recently seems to have increased ten-fold.  Change is good.  I thought I was one of those people that never changed but... thinking about it I'm a little bit different every year.  You can tell a lot about the way I am at a given time (haha sounds like the existential question) by a) what clothes I wear, and b) what is written in my yearbook  7th grade: lots of icky random preppy t-shirts with big blaring TOMMY or DKNY on the front, comments about being nice but pale 8th grade: juxtaposition of cutesy floof and skankier fare leaning more towards the alternative spectrum of stereotypes, probably in hopes of fitting in with Ed's friends.  yearbook comments revolved around this unsaid conviction of everyone i knew that i was indeed on drugs 9th grade: lots and lots of cartoony shirts cute, nauseating, brightly colored (oh how i love it), everything in my yrbook was written by a boy and about me being a lesbian slut 10th grade: weird matchy matchy shtuff, with a penchant for anything off beat and/or striped, yr book comments will probably mention seizures and speshul pills  anyways, the point of all this is, I really want things to change.  a lot.  and i think they will.  will post more later  bye... heres my old profile    etiquette9 23: D is for the dagger i am going to stick in your heart etiquette9 23: I is for ill people, and you are going to be one if you piss me off some more etiquette9 23: and E is for every single fucking thing you have done that has sent my life downhill etiquette9 23: i hate you etiquette9 23: so just die  LedZeppelin1292: It just occured to me that almost all of the sports I've done involve spandex  imnochewtoy: like on a scale of 1 to cute youre ashleigh   evilkennyoo 7: ive never had someone hop up on my shoulders and start rubbing her tounge in my hair  JerMan144: who else are you talking to? JerMan144: oh ... your project

So does Maria.  Maria i love you so much.  Seriously.  You rock so hard.  So does your brother's band.  Too bad there's a ringing in my left ear now lmao.  I haven't decided if Friday's game has pulled us together as a team, or pushed us further apart.  Honestly I don't care that much, I just wish people would stop getting hurt (mentally physically etc)  Today I went nuts and kicked a hole in our kitchen wall.  Long story, basically my dad is an ass and made me shovel ALL of the dog crap in our front yard because he got pissed when he stepped in some.  We have FOUR dogs.  I almost puked.  What a jerk.  Then I came in and he made me move all these paint cans into the basement and I was just tired of doing crap for him.  So he went out into the garage and I got mad and kicked the wall.  REALLY hard apparently.  A little bit harder than I kicked Matt's shin, now there's a hole the size of my fist in the kitchen wall.  I guess Matt's shin musta hurt a bit. :)  Also basketball was terrible.   4 suicides 20 laps around the gym 16 sprints (8 with balls overhead) not to mention  stupid ass defensive positioning drills  the employment of BUBBA in our outlet-layup drill five-man from hell 2 minute layup drill...olympic... the whole nine yards. all in an hour and a half  why do i suck at life?  and why DONT hate Jeremy?   good question.  :)  Hating people is fun until you realize there is nothing to look forward to anymore

       Today was a terrible day.  Somehow, I don't care though. :) I talked from the beginning of lunch, to right before basketball practice.... That's three and a half hours.

       I have several amusing stories to tell.  Unfortunately I can't really remember all of them.    I DO remember me and Vidya being psychotic children babbling in fake swedish about swedish fish and practicing our retarded scooby doo laugh before mondays game... haaaaaaaah.  what a weird week.  OOH GOOD STORY  So I run into Octavian and Annie in the hall after Chem or something right?  And she waves and says "Hi Ashleigh!!!" and  THEN she waves to the passing Mr. Majeskie, who promptly gives her a really sour look. I start laughing hysterically.  Annie doesn't understand why.   You see, on her hand in huge bold letters is written, "FUCK" Her other hand says "me." Apparently, it was Octavian's doing, but the fact that she didn't remember it and was unknowingly cussing out everyone she waved to that day makes me smile :) ok bad story.  it was so funny. you had to be there  evilkennyoo 7: aw man... most embarrassing moment of my life today evilkennyoo 7: at least between me and my mom spaceypiXiechick: uh oh spaceypiXiechick: how so evilkennyoo 7: i was eatin one of those yo crunch dealys (white yogurt) at the computer and i accidentally got some around the keyboard and i didnt realize it then my mom went down and was like "kenny... i think you should clean up after yourself" evilkennyoo 7: i thot i was gonna die   ALSO! Jose made my day.  That rhymed. :)  He gave me a mountain dew.  Now I am happy.  oh also  I give Rachel a ride home right? and she says to me as she leaves, "Ashleigh you know how much I like you?" me,"how much?"  "a whole poptart much!" and leaves a strawberry poptart on my dashboard. haaaaaah   -_-  I am obsessed with poptarts.  and carrots.  and trailmix. omg i could live on them forever.    do you like how i alternate between big words and unintelligible internet lingo?  especially when i randomly decide to capitalize/punctuate sentences  I have many many Jose quotes, but John Jarvis wrote em all down for me during HUM.  Don't worry, I'll get them  ASAP!!!!!

       I haven't written for awhile... mostly because nothing notably good or funny has happened.  That I would want to share anyways... That, and people are tired of hearing me complain.  I get comments like, "You're so fun to talk to when you're happy, cheer up."  This  could  be taken as a compliment, but instead I take it as me being nothing but a source of entertainment for other people.  It gets boring after awile, and annoying, because people think I'm being weird when I'm not bouncing off the walls and cracking 7th grade humor type jokes every 30 seconds.  Actually, if I don't do that it means I'm super comfortable with you and you should take it as a compliment... but whatever.  I'm so tired of miscommunications lately.  You'd think that for someone who talks as much as I do, I would be correctly understood, but no.  Same for other people.  Anyways, sorry for being a bitch to a lot of people lately.  I'm so apprehensive about my EEG results, I get them back next Monday.  This could change my life guys.  Hopefully he doesn't want to run any more tests.  I'm so tired of tests, in all facets of my life.  Someone told me they thought I'm stuck up.  That makes me sad.  Especially because I really have no self-esteem at all.  Because, just like I told Jeremy once, I'm not a pessmist or an optomist, just a realist.  I know what I am and am not capable of.  Or at least I thought I did, until recently when I began questioning the little intelligence/athletic ability/people skills/physical attractiveness I  thought  I had.    Okay I'm tired of writing and this probably isn't too much fun for you either.

       Today, Kelly, Andrew, Kenny, Matt Mahoney, and I went to see "The Passion of Jesus Christ." heh. Zeke is cute, "oh you're going to see Jesus??? *goofy look*"  kids are funny.  I felt strangely anti-social today.  What do people talk about? I can't remember.  Weeeiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrd.  Although last night I was all hallucinate-y and crazy.  Hearing noises that were'nt there and whatnot.  I think something is wrong with me. Maybe I'm just becoming a hypochondriac.  Anyhoo! Yeah.  What a good movie.  I cried for about two-thirds of it.  Which is ... a lot.  for me anyways.  I don't cry a lot... especially in public, except for that one day when i went kinda psycho.  :/  I'm just kinda in awe.  wowowowow.  I watched EVERYTHING I'm proud to say.  Horror movies are good training I guess.  ummm yeah.  Matthew Mahoney is definitely the most friendly person I have ever met.  ever. :) I wasn't my normal eeee look at me I'm an effervescent ball of fluff today and he was still SO nice.  Not so much today but just my general impression of him.  Have you ever met one of those people that always seems happy and just.. nice?  Like they'll smile at you even if they don't know you.  Or if he doesn't look HAPPY he at least looks pensive.  I wanna be one of those people.    I have a few funny stories.  They aren't really postable, though.  Besides my psychotic behavior of last night anyway.  I'll write that later but... it's kinda embarassing.  By the way, Maria is black.  That girl knew all of those BSU questions.  Insane.  The only one I knew was the one about grammy awards winners or something (halle berry and denzel washington hehe)   So I was reading about the people in the movie I just watched, and was shocked to find out that the guy who played Jesus is also the guy who played the younger son firefighter man in Frequency.  Weird huh.  This is such a sedate... fragmented entry.  It's pretty much how I feel though.  Time to study chemistry, but I'm soooo distracted.

       HAha.  urlLink Random Slogan Generator   I Think, Therefore Ashleigh.  Ashleigh Unscripted.  ^^ story of my life. anyhoo!   Because Majid decided to be Mr. Ironic and point out the irony in the fact that I rant at people about their spelling but am unable to capitalize or punctuate, this entry shall contain actual English.  Vidya managed to convince me to work out with the soccer girls today. Unfortunately, now their coach thinks I'm coming out.  If you had gym with me, you would know just how incredibly amusing this is.  We ran two laps around the school for a warmup and then over to the friendly neighborhood 7-11.  It was about three miles.  For someone who has been playing basketball since early November, three miles is pretty long.  However, because we rock so hard, we finished at about the same time as Abby Schuhart (probably one of the most athletic people I know.)  Then we went and stuffed our shirts with hot dogs at the varsity game. It was quite sexy, but because I am sporting the "I-hate-men" haircut no one seemed to notice my huge hot-dog shaped chest.    ok enough of this punctuation business it makes me wanna tear someones head off lol. weeeeeeee. ok thats out of my system.  now i have to make up some shit for english. we'll call ^that paragraph a warmup. yesh. warmup.   i forgot to take my pills today.  i fell asleep in like every class and had to drink two cokes just so i didnt pass out.  then my hands started shaking really bad in german. and my pants fell down a lot.  when we had to sing head shoulders knees and toes... wow.  bending over is bad.  doodododoooooooooo.    the darkness rocks.  there was something else i wanted to say. oh well.  doodleeedoooooooooooo

       Long time, no posts.  Maybe because Carisa made me a a  urlLink xanga  or maybe because I have nothing good to say.   This v-day wasn't that bad.  Actually I think I got more stuff than last yr... lol :P and the dance was alright, also we kicked SO MUCH ASS YESTERDAY!! i almost had a heart attack that game but we pulled through.w00000t.  I have a blow pop. mmmm. and reeses, and chocolate brownies and mocha ice cream mmmmmmmmmm. Not that I'm being indulgent or anything.  Nope.  My weight fluctuates so much it doesn't matter though. la. Um, so yeah. I bought a hair straightener and dyed it brown, even tho it came out red.  I think i have hair ADHD.  For reeeeeeeeeal.  Cause even though I dyed it like 3 days ago im already like.. umm.. blonde crop! weeeee. WHY AM I SO DUMB?!?! i tried to get my permit but forgot to bring my social security number thinger. grrrr. oh well.  blarrrrr.   i wish i could grow, so i could buy an entirely new wardrobe because right now i have so many clothes i cant buy anything.  i was going to write a deep entry and then decided against it because honestly who cares.  our freshmen are so hot. SO HOT. please someone marry me.  maybe i should actually talk to them. maybe. what am i even saying right now. ill actually say something real later.  except maybe... lets make a list of people who rock really hard recently:  rachel jose andrew... even tho hes a big dork joceline ella VIDYA and erin because she actually has boobs lol and maddie because she gave me food  not that everyone else doesnt rock.    because everyone does.  really really  i wrote a story about a girl named minxie. who the hell is named minxie? i dont know where i got that from... but either way if i have two girls, one is gonna be kiki and the other is gonna be minxie, and the boy will still be something completely normal.  omg maybe ill name him harry. Then I wrote this.  "Art imitates life.  Or so they say (I think.)  But in some cases life imitates art.  And in some cases the art isn't necessarily good, clean, or even remotely pleasing.  You could say that television is a form of art.  For some people, their life's art is more of the basic cable variety.  Take Jerry Springer for example."  That's about all that came out of an hour and a half of hum class, well that and minxie.  and me coming writing really weird metaphors involving dogs, raccoons, and garbage cans.  I can COMPLETELY incapable of writing fiction. what a shame.  and deep breathing. man mrs robbins and her yoga really rock.  rachel miller is insane. :) but she should take me home with her one day cause i feel bad about never seeing her.      im going to stop writing for fear of never shutting up

And it's a short day! And my gramma and i are gonna pick her up from robinson! I am haaaappy.  And tired. Very tired.   "Did you drink your Budapest?" "Joey needs a volunteer" "I need to adjust the bean bag." "Gangrene!!!!" "It's really more like a grey area..." And then there was Karin's impression of a sheep, which really was just her trying rreally hard to touch her toes... i was like "yoga???" holy crap. you woulda had to have been there.  there was a lot of other funny stuff too but i have no friggin clue, i mean... i had ... a toffee nut frappuccino, five mountain dews .... er "mountain lightning" lmao... and a gross net of five pieces of pizza.     im working on  areally long thing to go in here. be excited. its exciting. really.

       Noticed I haven't written anything in this for awhile. hrmmm.  WOW I'm sore.  Really sore.  My legs are starting to buckle when I walk even.  Forget walking up the stairs.  I'm really pleased with myself though, because slave driver Coach P is pleased with me and maria (s. yes. another. i know too many marias). Yeshyeshyesh.  Yesterday we ate a milkbone.  :)   We found it sitting in the track lobby.  That pretty much summarizes my mental state right now lol.  Endorphins are good.  I have lots of story but don't feel particularly inclined to tell them :P  There is one at the back of my mind, and I can't think of it.  That angers me.  Some silly kid making a really amusing slip-up.  Speaking of slip-ups I think I'm going deaf.  So today after track Megan DeBettencourt told me she liked my outfit or something. Somehow I heard, "What'd you guys do today?"  so I said, "hurdles." haaaaaaah  "I like your outfit today." "Hurdles." wow.  thats it.  wussy i know just go look at the xanga theres loads more than youd ever want to know about me in it.  since i know you stalk me

       where to begin.. where to begin. i'll start by documenting relatively amusing convos.  xXrejectdtearsXx: i love ashleigh xXrejectdtearsXx: in a straight freaking way xXrejectdtearsXx: NO xXrejectdtearsXx: in a straight nonfreaking way. xXrejectdtearsXx: i cant win. spaceypiXiechick: :-)  spaceypiXiechick: i dunno its creepy that u and ur brother would flirt with the same girl MBC2010: that what happens when u r 3 yr's appart MBC2010: it's never happened b4 spaceypiXiechick: wait so hes a 7th grader and he flirted with a 9th grader?! MBC2010: u don't compete with ur brother?  if you speak german.. im sorry. lol and nora prolly wouldnt want me posting this but eh thats ok  virgogurl4: woof woof spaceypiXiechick: meeeow virgogurl4: jose ist heiss und er ist gut mit seinen Finger.   um thats enough. lala. ok so ive decided i want a tattoo on the inside of my lip.. one on the back of my neck (barcode a la dark angel :P) and one in that area by ur hip that dips. yaaay.  hah. except not because i actually dont like tattoos.. but mostly cause they stretch! anyway. im also in need of a bellybutton ring.  and eyebrow ring.. or anti-eyebrow. too bad you cant have those in the corporate world :( *nods* yeah... dont ask i have some weird obsessions.  Today I was in a bad mood.  Discussions with Jose, however, made me realize that the quality of my life is generally dictated by the quality of my relationships.  This is a very bad thing because I have many an unhealthy relationship.  Sitting in the car on the way home from track, I realized that there are so many things I absolutely adore that have NOTHING to do with shitty friends.    DISCLAIMER: This is a really long, boring list.  It makes me happy though, so you can just eat me.  I love... Running in the rain.   Waking up with a dog in your arms. Waking up with a dog next to you in a makeshift noose (curtain string thingee) Candy corn, conversation hearts, pixi stix, and Dunkaroos frosting. Jumping. Up and down... Off of things... To get a rebound...On people... Into sand pits... And hanging with the crazy retardedly cool jumper kids. Miniskirts. Wheat thins and four leaf clovers given to you by otherwise stiff coaches. Closets. Finally getting your ears pierced at age 15. Hot chocolate at 6 AM.   Waking up at 3 AM to get a glass of orange juice.  Believing that your TV is going to murder you and that the fridge is possessed(like in the Ring) once downstairs. Writing terrible poetry. Writing narcissitic blog entries. Writing. Being a girl with chickenscratch handwriting. Dyeing your hair fifty-million different colors... only to have it turn out red every time. No one understanding you--yourself included. Reading trashy teen magazines in purple tinted bubblebaths. Indie movies, chick flicks, bad horror movies, good horror movies, raunchy comedies, and ZOMBIE movies. Laying outside and just staring up at trees until you forget you even exist. Halloween. Listening to really terrible music and loving it.  Country.  Spice Girls.  Techno.  Cheesy 80s rap.  pOp-PuNk. EMO! Trying to bake people yummy cookies and failing miserably. Feeding people in general. Weight lifting. Having an awesome brother you can brag about. Having a ****ing psycho family in general. Thrifting. Subway workers knowing exactly what sub you want. The smell of track.  Not the lobby, though. Shoes.  Kitten heels, ugly shoes, mary janes, sneakers, track spikes, flip-flops, slippers.  Stealing your mom's shoes. Nauseatingly bright colors.  Preferably combined with an equally nauseating cartoon character. Pot-bellied pigs, teacup poodles, and huge slobbery Great Danes. VH1. Biology.  Discovery Health Channel.  Neurology.   Knowing that you're going somewhere.  In life that is.      I like how that list really turned into a train of happy thoughts.    also, HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELLA!!!! Well, belated.  Girl... you rock. :) :) :) Also, you're probably the only person i would ever say anything as retarded as "girl, you rock." to.  which is good maybe? someday i will write more about ellas coolness.

       At the request of Jose I've decided to describe my love life... my horoscope pretty much sums it up. sigh.  On the love front: You have the attention span of a gnat, so anyone who isn't on the ball is kicked to the curb before you even give 'em a fair shot. That's how you weed out the faint-of-heart, though - when you find someone who sticks in your mind, you know that sweetie's here to stay.   But honestly.. I've kinda given up.  Besides track is much more interesting. to me...   For some reason no one else cares. heh. If I've been babbling to you about it a lot lately I apologize.  but you gotta understand... im going to penn relays!! holy shit!! im gonna get beat up for it because I took the place of Appie i think... oooh man. shes really mad and really good but the coaches think i deserve to go because i work hard (translation: i have no life and always show up to practice.) Either way, yours truly is going to run in a 4X100 and a 4X400 this thursday.  does anyone know how hard running a 400 m dash is? holy shit. AAAAAAGH. SO FRIGGIN HARD. i wanna puke just thinking about it... but im so excited, just sad ella cant go :( what a cool kid. for serious. we had fun on the field trip today, yay for looking at carved bones and being watched by creepy 30 year old men of indeterminate sexuality!! and getting SUPER BURNED. im a redneck... and i mean it.  guys im so excited. now all i need is some action.. and another spring break and a pony.. and a new haircut. and a new HAIRCOLOR agggh.   also nora and jose are so cute. :)  matt isnt as much of a jerk as i thought.. hes just... ehhhhhh lol not to smooth when it comes to making people feel better i guess ?   and kelly and i are going to write a book about how to exploit boys. oh what an exciting life.   i could just pee my pants. for serious. okay maybe not.  also if i didnt mention ur name please dont kill me. im thinking i should just assign people arbitrary numbers or something.. "so friend A was saying to me blah blah blah"

       I find this slightly disconcerting.  "ashleigh, your score is 19% consistent with a normal personality profile. You're least like others in the area of gender identity. "  my results from "The Multiphasic Personality Inventory" test lol i dont even know what that means but.. eek  also disturbing is my new quasi-hick persona.  AAAAAAAAAAGh  Over break I: Sat through two hours of Deadwood Went to see the Alamo w/ the asian posse Watched Nashville Star Raided my brother's MP3s and listened to sappy country love songs for 3 hrs+ Watched CMT  Okay so maybe it was because I was really bored and watched a lot of TV... but.... I dunno  Be afraid.  What should I do to my hair?

       somehow i forgot my password or username or something to my xanga. oooh well.  um. mindless blither time!! blither probably isn't a word.  Directions: 1. Put your birth month in an entry. 2. Strike out anything that doesn't apply to you. 3. Bold the six that best apply to you. 4. Put all twelve months under a journal cut.  Being cheap with journal space... im just gonna link this kid. im not really sure who it is though.. i was just reading random journals. heh  http://www.livejournal.com/users/aarfan/43845.html#cutid1 probably this link wont work. if ur dissappointed.. then um...you can just eat me. also since this thingee doesnt have a strike through mechanism. imma italicize the business that has nothing to do with me. shit this just isnt working out is it?  MAY:  Stubborn and hard-hearted.  Strong-willed and highly motivated. Sharp thoughts.  Easily angered.   Attracts others and loves attention.  Deep feelings. Beautiful physically and mentally. Firm Standpoint. Needs no motivation.  Easily consoled.  Systematic (left brain). Loves to dream. Strong clairvoyance. Understanding. Sickness usually in the ear and neck.  Good imagination . Good physical. Weak breathing.  Loves literature and the arts . Loves traveling.  Dislike being at home .  Restless.  Not having many children.  Hardworking.  High spirited.  Spendthrift.   I bet you're wondering: So. How's life Ashleigh?  The answer is: I don't even think about it anymore.  My existence as a sentient being is over.  Except maybe now.  This spring break was pretty... uneventful, but not particularly bad.  I think my body has started a bad trend of getting sick over vacations, though.  Ickyickyicky.  My tummy still hurts.  I went to track on wednesday and thursday and almost vomited.  Howeeeever, I'm happy I went because now I can 4-step!! yaaay.  That means nothing to anyone and anyone it does mean anything to would know that it's not a kind of square dance OR anything to be cheering about really but I don't care because I PR'd in hurdles in gym shoes, with shin splints, two days in bed, and alien spawn growing in my tummy! After seeing Dawn of the Dead today I'm more likely to believe that it is not alien spawn, but, in fact a zombie baby.  Disgusting movie.  Oh how I loved it.  I think the defining moment of spring break was the conversation that took place in Jose's kitched at like 9 P.M. on Saturday.  I learned so much in an amazingly short period of time.  Did you know of the existence of the jeanis? geanus? geanis? not genus... I don't know how to spell it, but I will forever be paranoid of my jeans now.  Thank you so much Mr. Jesse Markowitz.  :) Man this entry is a downer.  Sorry.  Just picture my grandmother impersonating short black bootylicious women in her foyer.  bwahahhaa.  I'm so proud to related to her... kinda

       So guys, I have a confession to make. Really I'm not very sane.  And I don't mean this in a cutesy way either.  I am one of those people Harry makes fun of because they have so little connection with humanity that they go write in their xanga etc. in hopes that someone somewhere will give a shit.  So maybe I haven't complained on this too much recently.  That doesn't change the screwed-up-ness factor of my life.  And don't flatter yourself by thinking what's bothering me is something about you although you did assist in putting me down this fucking psycho path (oh wonderous Jeremy etc.)  Holy crap why are people such jerks.  On another note, what happened to my so called intelligence? Anyone seen it lately?  So maybe I can't get pissed at people when they unknowingly label me as a vapid bimbo.  HowEVER, I think I wouldn't be this dumb if there wasn't so much drama.  Go away drama.  I think everyone could help me out by quitting with the stupid stupid lies they constantly feed me.  Someday all of the people like me that sacrifice their self-respect in an attempt to amuse others are going to lose it and blow everyone elses fucking brains out.  I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't post this.  But honestly, does anyone read it? No.  But I can pretend.  btw, I'm not actually going to shoot people so dont go reporting me to the school or anything  also im not that depressed but felt like expressing anger at a few people  rawr  actually this weekend was nice :) but that doesnt change the all-encompassing theme that is this life.  enough of this emo crap  goodddbyeee

       i found this in the depths of my computer. sooo bitter. i make myself laugh :) it isnt finished but im too lazy to do anything about that    *entirely new topic*  You know those quizzes you take that are like, "what's YOUR flirting style?" Well, they're crap.  I've decided to write profiles for each of the respective girl flirting stereotypes.   NOTE: I'm not judging. Just merely poking fun at my gender.  Because as much as I hate to admit it, I do it to.  The "Tee-hee Look at me I'm so Incredibly Helpless" Approach. These girls often begin with simple enough requests, "I'm stupid, can you help me do this problem?"  while batting their eyelashes feverishly.  Later it ends up being the boy doing her homework,  the boy buying her lunch,  the boy waiting patiently as she fake-bawls on his shoulder. Run away while you still can.    The "I am Perpetually a Five-Year Old and Shall Throw Rocks at you Until you Agree to Kiss me on the Swingset" Approach Pretending to hate someone.  What a quick way to their heart.  Usually only high school aged boys pull this one, but occassionally you run into a girl that does it.  They're the worst.  For serious.  Signature moves include: punching, kicking, throwing, stealing, and then running away giggling nauseatingly.  The "If I Don't Pay Attention to you, You'll want me" Approach Sometimes, people will make a large effort NOT to talk to you, just to make you jealous.  This is surprisingly effective considering the incredibly flawed logic behind it.

       Today my dad made us clean for like four hours.  That sucked a whole lot.  Anyway, I found this in one of my journal thingees from seventh grade hehe.    "hot pink and black toenails beneath my fucking preppy shoes it's hard to live this way confused about who i am and who i want to be unsure of what it is that others see try to be a punk, not a wannabe it doesn't quite work cause im only thirteen"  i was so... ahahhaha. wow this is an embarassing post. I dont even need to point out the... aghajgah in that so you can just laugh at it."  MOVING ON!    SCHOOL IS OVER! I am excited but also apprehensive because it is the first summer I don't have someone to latch onto everyday.  Where is my siamese twin? aaieeee.   So yesterday was the party. It was rockin. :) :) :) Thank you friends I really love you a whole lot!!!!! Sorry for being loud.  Too much caffeine... or something.  I think the best was when I tried throwing a water balloon at matt, but completely overshot and fell backwards in my lawn chair, proceeding to roll around in the grass laughing hysterically.  Or maybe when Maria or someone dared me to "hump the stump" and i started to and hit my crotch REALLY hard on a root.  Or MAYBE mud-wrestling maria and having my mommy yell at me :(  I am never ever EVER running in a swimsuit again.   baywatch... aaaaah.  the water balloons with maria and joceline.  using bio terms to describe their um... special shape.  globular!! haha...   okay enough of that. :) dadadadadadada I got some pictures developed and will scan them soon.  Ask me if you wanna see some...  i actually dont have anything interesting to say. that is rather depressing. ive been writing too much in this lately anyway

       Reading my profile for this thing I noticed I had written 14,263 words.  That's a lot.  I should learn how to write that much about school related crap.  Today my grandmother said I talk too much too quickly ahahaha. ALSO frau vaden wants her to come in next year and tell us stories about WWII in germany. YEESSSS its gonna be so funny. huzzah!!  so basically, for me, school is over tomorrow.  i have one last bio project and frankly i just don't want to do it.  DONT WANNA DO ITTTTTTTTTTTTT.  Chem and math blew.  The highlight of my week so far, was when I was mowing the lawn... I almost ran over two turtles.  I know what you're thinking, "O M G! Ashleigh!! You SICKO!!!!" But see I didn't run them over which was very happy.  Then I looked closer and noticed that one turtle was sitting on top of the other one, or rather MOUNTED on top of the other one.  Did you know turtles had sex?  I can't imagine it would be very exciting.  Either way I didn't watch for long because I felt like a pervert, and maybe I am. Yay! brain.. hurts  goodbye.  please will sOMEONE RSVP??? :P

         This entry will definitely make you think I'm  off my rocker .&nbsp; And... well I am so I guess that's ok.     &nbsp;   I was reading this blog... and this guy had all of his compulsive behaviors listed.&nbsp; Then I thought,  shit!&nbsp;I do some pretty weird stuff too!!!!  The thing is, it's part of having attention problems, not OCD.&nbsp; Really I am not clean or orderly, just weird.&nbsp;      When I run warmup laps I constantly count my steps... It gets pretty high.&nbsp; With crunches I count too, except I can't seem to count to fifty... always by tens.&nbsp; Running on treadmills is even worse because then it gives me the opportunity to calculate my mph, constantly.    When I copy stuff at work I always have to copy in the exact same manner... same way to put the paper in, same way to pick it up and staple and paper clip etc.    When I can't sleep&nbsp;I don't count sheep, I do math.&nbsp; Or speak german in my head.&nbsp; I hate math so I guess it helps me fall asleep better.&nbsp; Still though, pre-calc at 3 am?     I always have to have a game of spider solitaire open on the computer.&nbsp; Also before I could ever start hw I would have to win a game of solitaire... which was a convenient way of procrastinating I guess.&nbsp;      heh. that's all I feel like sharing.    So, what have I been up to lately?&nbsp; Lots of working.&nbsp; Unfortunately I can't stay at work for more than five hours a day or I get really bad headaches from the insanely boring shit I do.&nbsp; aieeeeeee.... So I've probably only made 200 dollars or soooo.&nbsp; The fact that I wake up at 11 every day probably doesn't help.&nbsp; I've been sleeping over at Karin's so much in the past couple of weeks that my sleeping schedule is so out of whack.&nbsp; We always go to bed at about 430 and wake up at noon... I feel like I have a hangover.  ALSO MY DREAMS ARE SO FUGGIN WEIRD!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;     I had one where a bunch of people I knew were going on a field trip somewhere and on the way back the bus stopped at Costco to eat (wtf?) then Luke insisted on buying potato chips but I was like, "No way man potato chips suck arse."&nbsp; We bought them anyway.&nbsp; Then... something involving filling up canyons with edible sand.&nbsp; Yeah, that's when it stopped making sense to me too.    I had another dream where Elizabeth Kulajhgsheza whatever her last name is came to TJ as a junior replacement because Robinson was depressing and spilled her guts to me. lmao.      &nbsp;   Then by far the best and weirdest of the three was when I was hospitalized for something and they had me hooked up to the lil electrodes I have at physical therapy, but instead of shocking/massaging my muscles they were there to monitor my vitals.&nbsp; I rolled over in my sleep and the electrodes came off, so of course the machine thought I died.&nbsp; Out of nowhere the little machine that shocks you when you have a heart attack pops out from under the bed and shocks me, feeling uncannily like those invisible fences for dogs, then&nbsp;a nurse hears me screaming and comes in to turn the thing off.&nbsp; Then she's like shit why are you here you're just getting your teeth fixed.&nbsp; My friggin huge tooth falls out and she tells me I can go.&nbsp; So I get in the car with Karin (why was she there? who knows...)&nbsp; and we realize neither of us can legally drive.&nbsp; Because this is a dream and not reality we decide I should be the one to drive.&nbsp; It's dark and we're on Popes Head and I accidentally swerve on the wrong side of the road and nearly hit someone.&nbsp; Then I go, "Damn! It's a good thing this Accord has such tight steering!"&nbsp; WTF WTF WTF lol. We get to our destination and it turns out it's Rachel Miller's house.&nbsp; I'm not sure what happened from there... something about how I needed to see her so badly I just drove over to her house with driving ability whatsoever.&nbsp; Then I think I might have professed my undying love of her.&nbsp; And then I woke up.      aieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  &nbsp; SO WEIRD.&nbsp; But it's cool that I could remember my dreams in that much detail.     &nbsp;   Enough about dreams.&nbsp; Last Sunday we all went over to Maria's and had our very late 4th of july party.&nbsp;  AND THE COPS BUSTED US . ahahaha.&nbsp; I thought the car was Andrew's dad's and then I realized that there was a spotlight shining in my face and I was like ohhh shit.&nbsp; Somehow I couldn't wipe the shit-eating grin off my face, though.&nbsp; Fortunately he didn't kill us.&nbsp; Still I'm impressed at how badass we are.&nbsp; OOH OOH and we made Raj wear makeup.&nbsp; Hoooooot.&nbsp; He looked like a cross-dressing Indian Cleopatra but boy was it  hot .     &nbsp;   Watching King Arthur made me want to go out and kill people with swords like a pseudo-amazon.

Wednesday: Went with Andrew to PG county to babysit my sister church's lil kids.  Oh my gorsh.  SO CUTE.  "Ashleigh and Andrew sittin in a tree... kyssnaajgnana" they couldn't really spell.  aaaand then we played tag in the parking lot and i didn't get hit by any stray bullets!! (stupid dad) Then we played simon says... and andre was all like "simon says stick your finger up your nose, simon says stick your finger in your ear, simon says stick your finger in your mouth!!! the SAME FINGUH YOU STUCK IN UR NOSE!!!!" aieee. omg too cute too cute too cute.  andrew got a picture of one clutching me and he was all like acting like i was his momma and it was so sad and so adorable and then he whips out the camera and the kid pulls out an east side symbol -_-.  haha ALSO "simon says lay eyes on the pimp!!!"  I made a new friend.  His name is Dashawne.  He is the coolest lil kid ever.  It's so sad cause they all have parents that don't give a crap and they don't have beds and shit and they were just so happy to have people pay attention to them.  I think imma go back because I had so much fun.    haha ok so that was a long wednesday."i can do a lot more than that with my socks big boy" BUT ITS NOT EVER YET. then party at marias haaaah so funny. sooo funny. we played men are from mars women are from venus. bwahaha. um. and then karin slept over. and hten the next day i lost my dog! and then i found him that jackass. AND THEN i went to the mall with ed and his awesomepossum friends... coffeecoffeecoffeecoffee WE PLAYED WARIO WARE THAT IS THE MOST CRACKHEADED GAME EVER.  cool though.  Then I decided I might gauge my ears.. ooooh.    And then it was today.  And we went to the farm and chilled with supersuperusper cool old ladies and talked about stuff and i ate the best peaches of my entire life.  I am so serious. The peaches were better than the cake.  And it was chocolate cake  So today I realized that I am such a friggin dreamer when it comes to my goals.  i was like...   I want to write a book. I want to teach English in Japan. I want to become a doctor. I want to start my own business.    haha so the last one is really an fd up idea. I want to start a dog salon where you give them punk hairstyles and dye 'em and give em pedicures in bright colors.  siiigh  Um, so that was my week.  Well, about half of it.  PHYSICAL THERAPY!!!

       Haha. So this week has been interesting.    Yeah.  I'm unable to sleep right now and am talking to Max who is also struck with insomnia. weeeeoooohwwweeee  Max is a cool kid even if he would rather not admit it.  Yesterday I spent most of the day with my brother which was cool. We went to Potbellies and his friend Stephanies house where i played with her whacko dogs.  she had this really senile sausage dog that would like snarl at you and then forget about it and start licking you... nonstop.  He was cute though.  ALSO SHE HAD A DOG NAMED WALLACE. TOO COOL.    then we went to the gym. i cant move the armmmsssss aaaaagh.  bought clothes for brian afterwards which was surprisingly fun.    i am sooo sore today from falling down a lot and the gym and shit.   man im not very witty at 6am.    dammit where is my other earring. and my other flip-flop.  and who left their flip-flops at my grandmothers house man.

       Today I went to the optometrist to pick up my new  urlLink  emo   glasses.  Uber cute.  There we found out that the guy who always helps us pick out frames is moving on to bigger and better things later this month.  This may not seem like a big deal but  I love  this guy.  In high school he was the weird scrawny kid with long hair and a funny name that later turned into a babe magnet.  (Literally, as evidenced by a halloween costume he had one year... consisting of troves of barbies stuck to a magnet-y suit.)  People used to come up to him and go "ARARARARARARAR" because his name is Deano, pronounced like Dino... from the Flintstones.  Deano Ventura.  How much cooler of a name can you get? If you have a name like that you are obviously destined for stardom.  So he is leaving my very odd optometrist's office to pursue a career in music, inventing, and warehouse management.  Talk about being ADHD.  Apparently his band is going to provide music for CSI this upcoming season... too bad his band isn't called something totally rad like "Deano and the ________" (does it really matter who the other people are? nahhh.)  Tonight I will wake up at 3 AM knowing that somewhere in the wilderness of Manassas there is a 39 year old trapped in a 19 year old's body mountain biking until his legs fall off, hopefully he doesn't run into a deer.  That is the end of my tribute to the dude that picked out my glasses.   In other news, my grandmother had to put Fancy down.  For those of you who didn't have the  privelage  of meeting Fancy, she was my grandmother's decrepid, crotchy, old, Eewok dog.  18 years old.  I think it was actually already dead, but they were using experimental treatment that involves turning your dog into a zombie.... which means I should probably blow up University Drive Veterinary Clinic before tons of monsters created by the Umbrella corporation bust loose.  In all seriousness though, I love you Fancy.  You were a good dog.  R.I.P.  Mostly I feel sad for my gramma cause now she sits at home complaining of dizziness and cries sometimes.  :/

       Brian just attacked me with electric nosehair clippers. What an exciting weekend lol.  Too much taco bell. Too much money being spent. Not enough sleep. However I am very happy because my family spent about $650 on electronics. We aren't like friggin' rich either. Unfortunately I also blew my entire paycheck. Aieeee.     Canon Powershot A60 digital camera, its only a 2 megapixel camera but I don't think I need any better since I'm just an "amateur"  Random camera accessories... camera bag etc so I don't break the damn thing  256 MB flash card (extra camera memory)  Color all-in-one photo printer dealie. seriously effing nice. LCD display and you don't need to hook it up to a computer since it's wireless.   Faster wireless router ... I don't really understand what these do  Spiderman and one of the Matrix games for Xbox, Prince of Persia for PS2  The nice cd player my dad bought my grandpa for christmas last yr, since he can't figure out how to work it (understandable considering the dudes 94)  My brother's old DVD burner since he's buying a new one... not yet in my possession but still   It feels like christmas!!! especially because this stuff is way better than what I got at christmas (i think... honestly I don't remember what I got)  Except it's not as cool because I financed about $200 worth of it.  We got the camera at Microcenter and I swear... it was like if you took TJ's computer science team, made them 1.5X dorkier, and fast-forwarded 10 years.  I was the only white female there, well, besides my mom.  So, the other day I had this really nice... sentimental entry written.  It took me at least an hour to write because it was the survey thing that was addressed to anonymous people.  Well, my session timed out and I lost everything I had typed.  So... sorry.  Basically it was all... blah blah I love lots of people.  But a couple suck. yep!!  blahblah.  end shallow happy entry.  boring yes.  sorry.
