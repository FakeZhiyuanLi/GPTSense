Do we have a show for you tonight! Our first guest needs no introduction. But since we get paid by the hour here, we'll introduce him anyway. Sue?    Well Jim, our guest is a star of stage and screen - the computer screen, that is. You've seen his work on slides, overhead projectors, and the Internet. This adventurous soul makes presentations that have pizazz.     He's a star of many talents. He can handle charts, clip art, music and narration, video clips, you name it -- whatever it takes to make the presentation shine.    Put your hands together and click your mouse for my very special friend, Microsoft PowerPoint.      "

Along with the blues, its forefather, it is one of the first truly indigenous musics to develop in America, yet its unpredictable, risky ventures into improvisation gave it critical cache with scholars that the blues lacked. At the outset, jazz was dance music, performed by swinging big bands. Soon, the dance elements faded into the background and improvisation became the key element of the music. As the genre evolved, the music split into a number of different styles, from the speedy, hard-hitting rhythms of be-bop and the laid-back, mellow harmonies of cool jazz to the jittery, atonal forays of free jazz and the earthy grooves of soul jazz. What tied it all together was a foundation in the blues, a reliance on group interplay and unpredictable improvisation. Throughout the years, and in all the different styles, those are the qualities that defined jazz."

       urlLink Tongue Twisters : "..Return to Home Page.. Punjabi Nursery Rhymes.. Tongue Twisters.. ..        Welcome to the terrific, tantalising, teasing, ticklish and testing world of tongue twisters. Contributions are most welcome, preferably those that are longer than a line, unique, yet amusing.  Ok so this page doesn't get a few hundred hits a day nor does it have any fancy Splash or Flash animation, but I have had a slow and steady stream of appreciative tongue twisting fans visiting a few times a year.  I am sorry if I am unable to respond to my email quickly due to my workload( ..sigh..the things we have to do for money!) and the unbelievable amount of spam from putting up a webpage( ..unbelievable I tell you..). But rest assured that your contributions will be put up on the webpage if they are found to be suitable.  Thank also to those who somhow still manage to find mispelling gramatical and mistakes.( ..ok that was on purpose..)  Thanks everyone. "
