         Hey, I'm Leo and welcome to my world.  (This is the first thing I have ever posted on this website!:))  Anyway, firstly I thought I would tell you about something I'm doing with my school at the moment - just in case anyone's interested.    Duke of Edinburgh is a programme which operates in 100 countries worldwide and I am just one of up to 200,000 participants who want to 'take the challenge' and try something new.  Duke of Edinburgh is a great way to learn new things, meet new people and experience a different way of living and thinking as you explore new things and experience your surroundings in a different way than ever before.  It is also looked upon highly by universities, colleges and employers and helps a lot when trying to enter a good job/college/university.  I'm not sure but gold (if you're brave enough) may be the equivalent to an A* A-level.    The main idea of the Duke of Edinburgh Award is for you to fulfill your ambitions by exploring the wide choice of activities covering Service, Skills, Physical Recreation, Expeditions, and, at gold level, a Residential Project.  The aim is for you to choose what you want to do and then set yourself goals and personal challenges (don't worry if you reckon this sounds boring or worrying, I didn't set myself 'personal challenges', and the fun you have meeting new people is the best bit).  If you do set yourself goals then your goals might be to improve on your current best performance, or to develop a completely new skill or ability.  Perhaps you will gain qualifications and awards along the way.  Your goals can give you targets to aim for, which can be reviewed or changed if necessary.  Whatever you want out of life - use the Award to help you get there.    Remember that Award Leaders and helpers are there to support you.  As you progress through the three levels you will find that you want to take increasing responsibility for planning and organising your own programme.  Gaining an Award is a matter of pride, giving you a sense of achievement and the confidence and that will be with you for life.  The more you put in, hopefully the more you will get out.  This is an amazing way of doing what you have always wanted and if you do the Award it is your own personal challenge, you will never have to compete with anyone. The age range for D of E is from the 14th to the 25th birthday and the minimum ages for each award are as follows: Bronze - 14, Silver - 15, Gold - 16.   How does the Award operate?   The Award operates through a system of delegated responsibility.  Operating Authorities are licensed by the Award to operate the programme and to maintain its quality and standards.  This responsibility is then delegated to Award Leaders and, through other helpers, to participants.  Get it?  At each level there are four sections.  1.   Service  - to encourage service to individuals and into the community.  For your service you will have to undertake a training course or help/work for a service which involves the community.  This could be: assisting at day centres, creches, playschemes; assisting children and young people at risk, award leadership; child care; dance leadership; helping children and young people with special needs; learning support; mountain/expedition leadership; religious education leadership; sports leadership; uniformed youth organisation leadership; visiting children in care; youth work; peer support projects; community care; fire fighting; assisting with community based charities; community support for elderly or disabled people; first aid; helping at clubs; homes and day centres; home nursing; support for elderly or disabled people and visiting elderly or disabled people.  2.   Skills  - to encourage the discovery and development of personal interests and social and practical skills.  For your skills there is a wide range of subjects to choose from, you can do whatever you want.  The skills section is meant to help you to meet new people, organise you time, discover how to research information, work with others, enjoy sharing and to discover new talents.  I will only give you a few examples as there are loads.  You could do: Animals - keeping, breeding, studying, racing, handling etc.; art and design - painting, drawing, etching, calligraphy, enameling; billards, snooker and pool; boat building - construction, restoration; cars - engineering and construction; choirs; darts; debating and public speaking; fantasy games; film and video production; gardening; glasswork; health and style; IT - computers, web-site design, use of standard packages, design of systems; journalism; languages; life skills; magazine and newsletter production, marksmanship; money matters; mosaic; vehicle maintenance; music playing; performing arts, pottery and ceramics, sculpture; religion; sport appreciation; sport officiating; stamp collecting; taxidermy; wine making; young engineers; young enterprises; zoology.  (Phew!)  3.   Physical Recreation   - to encourage participation and improvement in physical activity and improvement of performance and to enjoy keeping fit and healthy!  Again, you can choose anything as long as it is physical exercise.  Eg.: surfing; aerobics; baseball; basketball; BMX racing; canoe polo; kickboxing; carriage driving; curling; cycling; dance; dragon boat racing; fencing; gymnastics; judo; hurling; netball; orienteering; parachuting/gliding; real tennis; rounders; running; sailing; snowboarding; sub aqua; tennis; trampolining; volleyball; water polo; wrestling; yoga.  4.   Expeditions  - to encourage a spirit of adventure and discovery or so I'm told ...  This includes either cycling/riding/rowing/canoeing/a foot expedition of so many miles for so many days including overnight camping for however many nights.  The number of days, minimum hours of activity per day, minimum of hours spent journeying and distances all depend on the level you are taking which will be either bronze, silver or gold.  I hope this gives you a little insight to something that might interest you in the future sometime and if you would like more information on the Duke of Edinburgh Award then go to   www.theaward.org      - good luck!
