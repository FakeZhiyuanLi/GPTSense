      alright, holy crap! i haven't written since tuesday. sorry guys. i'm at the library for the second night in a row. grr... stupid science. actually reading about the progressing reproduction of human and animal cells (cloning) is quite interesting... yet extremely boring. i saw matt breton at the library yesterday. heather is apparently mad at me for saying her hair was messy. but it was!!! connor is getting to be weird. i miss a lot of my old friends that i never talk to or see anymore. i got pretty big plunger stubs today. i can't WAIT for the band wars. until next time, gaze longingly into the distance and growl and cross your eyes at the person who asks if you're okay. lol, bye!!

      alright, sorry i haven't updated in a long time. i dissapointed (disapointed?) my followers *sigh*. i had an okay weekend. i made a lot of money (well, to me at least). thursday night was so fun! i went to my grandparents on friday night and worked all weekend. i came home on sunday night and called soemone(s) then i did my laundry. oh ya, i asked my sister to come to the pretty big plunger concert with heather and i next week and she said yes. it's cause i never see her and i miss her. i also wish her the best of luck with matt, i hope he treats her better, or else i will brutally kick his ass. good thing she doesn't know about this or she'd be mad. so my weekend was okay. i don't really have any plans this week. except i have tons of band pratices and stuff. but that shouldn't be too bad. oh ya! i found this AWESOME 80's music my grandma sent over a while ago and i love it. love amazing amounts, bekah. oh ya, and leslie is the biggest liar (don't worry jenna, i'll beat her for you) natty isn't looking al lthat great either.

      today is better. at least i think it is, it had been so far. the i'm-such-a-loser-i'm-feeling-sorry-for-myself-because-i-suck is gone. and i (wonderful rebekah) is back! tonight should be fun. in computers. nothing really to report except i'm good at qord searches and i just bombed a fairly easy test.

      today sucked. well, at least it's not worth writing about. i would kill myself, but my family needs me so i'm not that stupid. at the court house, some old lady is like (to me, heather, em alex and janek) (conversation to follow)  Old Lady: so are you guys here on a school trip? Me: no Old Lady: then why are you here? Me: I'm involved in a court case Old Lady: really? Me: yes, i stole a car Old Lady: *nervous laugh* oh, it that so? Me: ya Old Lady: so how old are you? Me: 14, so hopefully i'll only get juvi Old Lady: oh *walks away in a nervous fluster* it was so funny, she deserved it too, nosy. i am in such a shitty mood. plus jenna can't come to my party. i hate my life. it sucks. well, i love my family and freinds so i'm glad i was born to meet them. i hate him. so very much. he has stained my (crappy) life.

      yesterday was a regular boring day. we went out for lunch which was good. i wish we did that everyday, then i could avoid her. i think andrea and alexa are mad at me because i left while they were practicing (our septet) and i didn't come back. everything was bugging me in music. argh. science class was better than usual but rees is an ass. bus ride yesterday was alright. (he is different now and only one person knows who it is) he gave me the finger this morning but he was smiling. when i got home i slept. then my mom woke me up, we had the dumbest conversation: Mom: time to eat! Me: nope, not hungry Mom: so you're not eating Me: no Mom: does that mean you're not coming Me: no Mom: so you're not eating Me: no Mom: why aren't you coming Me: dunno Mom: so when are you coming? Me: MOM!!!!!!! Mom: oh, okay my mom is pretty ditzy but that was extra funny. my guinea pig is the best. fudgie i love you! she recognizes me and stuff. today i have a french test which is bound to be horrible. then i slept for the rest of the night. i woke up at 11 and did my homework and i went back to sleep. this morning i walked! yay! i'm going to rachelle's tonight because cell is at her house. and because i love her. i had the most halarious conversation with heather last night. it was like we were stoned but we weren't. we laughed so hard for such a long time at nothing but it was fun. today is going to suck i can feel it. i'm a pessimist, but mostly right.

      heyheyhey. i had some people say thst yesterday they were trying to access this site and it wouldn't go. now it's works, so no worries. my new guinea pig is awesome. she's really cute, six months old. her name is fudgie. my brother picked her up and he says' oh look how cute you are, i love you guinea pig' then she bit him. wincing with pain he goes, 'you're a brat, but i still love you'. it was cute. i love her so very much. she was scared at first but now she's always squeaking which means she's happy. my mom's very christian conformist friend thinks i go clubbing. it's very funny cause i think clubbing is dumb, however, the occasional concert is not. going out to lunch today. yes! i never go off. jenna and lesley are coming too. it should be fun. computers isn't. i'm going to rachelle's tommorow cause cell is at her house. so far, my day has been boring. all i did yesterday afetr i posted was laundry. smile! bekah

      hello. it is sunday, at 1:14 p.m.yesterday morning i went to the market with heather. then we went back to my house, we spent the whole time just laughing. it was great. yesterday we were supposed to go with jenna, lesley, jeff, ryan, russ and steve and heather and i. it didn't work out so heather, lesley and i went. we saw elf. we also saw, shelby (with kaylee and ben p.), kara lee, maddie, emma, thomas, eric, andy, matt, ben h. (he was with some adam kid from swimming) and seb. i'm sure we saw other people we knew but i forget them. elf was stupid, but funny. after heather came to my house and then i got stuff and went to her's to sleep over. at her house i called ben (h.) cause i haven't talked to him in a while. he was burnt out, but i miss him. i'll see him on monday anyways. so, today i was supposed to go to the mall with kara lee and maddie but maddie is in toronto and kara lee deosn't feel like it. besides, i went to the mall yesterday. i am going grocery shopping with my grandma now. i might update later if anything happens. love all who reads, bekah.

      today was... interesting. the rest of yesterday rocked. after the biggest fight with leslie (heather yelled at me *tear*). i'm glad i got it out. but the problem isn't resolved. so i'm going to do something REALLY hard... not hang out with them anymore. which i hate, but i'd only hurt them more if i stayed. *very sadly* i love you guys. ya, yesterday right after lunch lesley and i left school and walked downtown and then to my house. we stopped everywhere so we could stay warm. we fell asleep on a couch and my brother on the floor. and we slept until her mom came. i forget what i did during the night, i forget. gah! today was satisfactory. lunch sucked. computers was alright. i forgot about jazz band. talked to alex on the bus. jeff gave me a 6 page letter!!!!!! he's turning really writingish. but it took him almost a week to get it all out. lol. i'm babysitting tonight. i can't wait for tommorow, i love heather. (whale talk) wooooooo, huinnggggggssssh, iooooooooooonnmghhhhhh. that was my whale talk. so i have a good weekend ahead. good bye, and have a lovely life. much love, bekah.

      man, my dad sucked yesterday. it really sucked. it was horrible. my computers teacher tottaly hates me. the thing is all i want is for him to help me when i don't understand. my day just got worser and worser. it sucked so much. band was alright though. i love music. then at night it got better. first i had a big fight with my mom. (that doesn't make it better). then i went outside in the storm. i love them so much. thunder and lightning have me in awes, but i'm also scared of them. i love, LOVE storms!! and rain!!! i forget what i did for the rest of the night... something... i think. the storm made it better. plus i talked to heather and lesley on the phone and decided what to do about HER. that made it better too. after this class we'll have a talk. speaking of which. the buses aren't running today because the weather is crazy so we don't have many people in class. spencer and i were the only ones who wanted to play. he was wuite nice to me. we played together at the end. he's pretty good and i like jingle bell jazz. plus heather's mom (who drove me to school) thinks i'm funny. today (i think) will be good. by the way, jenna, heather and lesley, i don't want to leave. lewis is acting like his snobby self, again. maybe he's just madly in love with me...

      well, i am at school. i had such an awesome remainder of the day yesterday. lunch sort of sucked (she was around). then science was alright besides that fact that once again i am totally lost and confused. we had a fire drill. that was sort of fun. i was being mean to her but in a way that i was joking so she didn't take me seriously which i guess is good because i don't want an enemy. although when i went to see my brother (common lunch) she followed me which made me MAD. plus when she came over she would flirt with him. i really don't like that. i love my brother very much and i strongly dislike her. we went to the football game. after forever heather finally sat beside russ. i was on his other side. russ and i did most of the talking which i felt bad for. and he licked my lollipop (yucky!) well, not really. then when he left he hugged heather and he had previously put his arm around her during the game (twice). we went to tim hortons and then to andrea's house which is way cool. heather's mom picked us up. i got home, ate dinner and left (again). i went and put my film in to get developed, then we picked up rachelle and went to cell. this cell was actually good. i liked it plus... WES SAID I COULD HAVE HIS GUINEA PIG. yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hope i'm allowed. i came home, did my homework and went to bed at a ridiculously late hour. i woke up late this morning. i rushed to the bus, caught it. i saw the cutest thing. this guy i had always thought was mean moved his knapsack from the seat beside him for an old man and offered the seat to him. it was quite cute. i was touched but pretended i didn't notice because the old man didn't take the seat. today so far has been okay. my pictures are awesome. my muscles hurt from volleyball. oh yes, the list was posted. i was cut, but that's okay. i can wait until next year. and ya, my comuters teacher just ignores me. i'll ask him a question and he pretends he doesn't hear. he totally ignores me. it's funny but also really frustrating. until a later time, good day.

      i was yp at 5:00 this morning. ah, the horror, never again. it wasn't that bad. jen needs to learn how to set some one but other than that, it was good. i like over hand serving. it's a good way to get anger out. whichi  have a lot of. oh ya, shelby, thanks for making me a link, i miss you very much. music was alright (i'm in computers now which is second) music is first. andrea got even with me and we have a truce. i played the flute and the clarinet. nathan taught me 3 notes on the flute. i can't play jack shit on the clarinet... like will go on. i like my baritone (and trombone!) better. i'm sitting beside lewis. he acts like a prince and he's got a massive ego. he two-times girls and doesn't apologize (he directed evil looks toward me). he says an online diary isn't safe. but this isn't a diary. i'm gypping all of you. i don't (half of the time) write down my feelings and stuff. or stuff in my family. so you're getting a half ass deal. anyways, i will go. later.

      today was good. and busy. i had all good classes. got exrta help in science (at lunch) to help mr. giaschi realize that i really am stupid. ryan hugged me. yay! i haven't seen/talked to him in a while. i missed him. i must buy tickets soon (tommorow??) for flashlight brown/planet smashers concert. on a monday, my parental unit may have trouble with that. i rushed home and saw ben with his braces off (very nice, he's quite cute). and then i went to volleyball. some girl punched me in the face. my lip bled and it's a bit swollen. i'm alright though, she didn't even notice. she gave me a dirty look for 'getting in her way' when she was going vertically in a straight drill. *sigh* then i went grocery shopping with my mom. i was still pretty hyped from volleyball so i was bouncing off the walls and embaressing her. sorry mom. at least i didn't kiss the pickles like last time. ah, lol. i am so nuts. oh yes, after science (4th period) i was walking back to my locker and i saw HIM with a girl who i won't name. she saw me and whispered furiously into his ear. then they laughed. the look on my face (anguish) must have looked like jealousy, so in conclusion they still think i like him and now i'm a jealous bitch. that ruined my day until i saw donald drop his baby (family studies) and run after his girlfriend (while taking off her sweater) while she ran after these guys that were making fun of them. ah, lmao. jeff loved it. espescially because we had just said the other way he was ever goign to get laid was if he raped someone, then he goes and rips off her sweater. ah, ha, ha, ha. by the way, she was laughing and everything so i'm not being totally evil. ya, i have volleyball again at 6:30 in the freaking morning. so i better go. whatever you do, don't get a freind like_ _ _ _ _ _ so she can blab who you like to everyone and you get funny looks in the hall. oh man, i suck. later.

      ah, ha, ha, ha. greatest (almost) moment of the day. my sister walks up to my brother and pounds gently on his back with her fists. after a few seconds she remarks, 'mommy doesn't like it when i do this, she says it hurts her back and it makes her fart'. lol!!! it was so great. this morning i went to the park with heather to meet jeff. heatehr had to wake me up, ha, ha sucks to be her. i sang a song and watched the chair to make sure it didn't make any sudden movements. after the very long walk to the park and a nice chat with jeff. (i also slept on the park bench). we went back. my mom picked me up. and andrea. my septet is amazing!!!!!! i had sooooooo much fun. jake, connor i love you! megan i love you too! mary is cool as well. and of course, andrea. we are really good, and i have the best pictures. after the septet, i went home, did my laundry and my family went to the cochrane's (where my sister lives) and had dinner. i got in trouble for being withdrawn and unhappy. i was really unhappy. seeing my sister upset me. those of you that know me well know what's going on. and i'l ltell you about it later. now i'm home, again. and i have homework. by the way, eric, i will miss you when you move, very much. you are my childhood buddy. later.

      hey. hey. hey. my friday night is over. i went to a hockey game after school. i saw this guy there that asked me out in grade 7, brought back memories. i saw thomas's mom. she's nice, but his dad was like 'who's that?'. by the way thomas, if you ever read this, nice goal. i hate being seen at hockey games in public, i get so worked up and people stare. what can i say? i have a passion for the game. also the man behind us was like, 'geez, skate, skate. oh, that was stupid. who was the stupid one? eh, don't be stupid'. it was funny. i then went home. practiced my beloved baritone. though i wish at times it was a trombone. then i went babysitting. the baby was teething so she cried sometimes. i felt so bad, i wanted to give her my teeth (ew, gross). ya, well, now i'm home, ready to get up bright and early to go to the market with heather. yay. sleep tight.

      wow, how deep (and crazy, random most likely uncomprehensible) of me. today was mediocre, not bad. jeff wrote two pages, how incredible. he must have been shackled to a desk with nothing else to do. at lunch, i threw my bottle in the direction or the garbage. alas, it tipped right off the rim and smashed to the ground in peices, i felt horrible, but it was SO funny! i just left it there because i didn't know what else to do. i had band, met tommy, cool guy, and crazy. my weekend is full, again, i won't be sleeping at home. good thing it's filled with doing stuff with people i love. i wish heather and russ good luck in their friday night movie and their future as a (hopefully soon to be) couple. also, i am SOOO mad at a girl, she knows who she is. she said she has to talk to me, so call me if you must.

      How can one love, when another hates? How can one laugh, when another is in pain? How can one dance, when another cannot move? Enjoy your freedom young friend. Be happy when other are not. Spread the love when others are down and give hugs all around. You have not loved until you have lost. You have not eaten until you have been hungry. Hallow souls unite, I have a piece to write tonight.  Love, slow, sweet, soft and true. Abide and happiness will come to you. Hurried kisses, love affair, pain and worry, we are not aware. Pure, clean and delicate, your heart is yours to commit. Tears spilled, minds filled, with an angry thing the lie may bring. Despair, has an air of one who does not care. Would it care to share why love isn't fucking fair? Love many times, my friends, and discover the soul that connects with yours, forever more. But what do I know? I'm only 14.

      my sister had a ladybug on her finger. i hit her hand with an apple picking bucket (first i dumped the apples out). i killed it and it dropped to the floor. i then put the box over top of it and told her to step on it. the whole time she stared at her finger, horrified. she then looked at me and said "eww, this is gross, my finger is all orange, it hurts and plus dead ladybugs make my fingers smell". lol. ah, my brother and i laughed a long time. i went to cell, i love wes's guinea pig, it is so cute. (belle and canalle R.I.P) yes, well, i'm off.

      word of the day: transmugufugor why? (explained in the following conversation)  rebekah: you have a wrinkly neck, old age is starting to show (he's 17)  arthur (my brother): do i?  rebekah: you have to tranmuguforgifier yourself  arthur: i do?  rebekah: yes  arthur: the word is transmogifier  rebekah: oh i love my family. i went to lunch with my sister today, french has been skipped. after school i went home with my lovely friend, brianne, who says hi. we are at my house. we went to the nutty chocolatier downtown. and we (well i really) checked how much the planet smashers are at the door. so now i have to get heather to come with me to buy tickets ahead of time. later on i have cell, which will suck, but it's either that or church. it's not that bad, i do see wes but normally he only talks to laura so... this blog has turned boring. have an amazing day and smile at the lonely walls.

      still at the library. adults here seem to have no respect for kids (i.e. me). i asked for a book 'runner' and the lady's just like, there's computers over there, use them. after i told her that i had alreayd looked the call numbers up she was like 'i don't care, check again'. so, here i am, pretending to check the call numbers. i'm going home soon anyways, whoa wait, now. oops, i'm late.

      i'm home now. i hate doing my papers already, but when stuff like this happens... for instance lady at the apartment: you really shouldn't listen to music while you deliver  me: but it's dark out and it's raining  lady at the apartment: well, still, it's good manners not to listen to music, goodness  someone must have been having a bad day. i had a pretty good day. i didn't see him much, actually at all. but that was on purpose. i'm skipping french tommorow to attend lunch avec ma soeur. that should be interesting. plus missing french is always good. tonight i think i'll go to the library. i miss reading. it's odd, but i do. yes, well. i'm done. i'm angry at a bunch of people (well, 2) but they deserve it and they know it. you know who you are. once again, to the people or person (ha, ha, i bet) who read this, i love you very much, you'll be in my will. *hugs*

      hey. hey. hey. i now have to write about my weekend all over again. halloween sucked. it was funny when the guys across the street whistled at us. when the girl out the car window yelled 'hook it'. when the guy said to the m+m 'don't eat yourself' and when the university students were doing headbombers behind us while the guys hit on us. after getting candy (i never want to see chocolate again, or sugar)\, i went to heather's. heather i love you! you made the night better. in the morning we wnt to the market, alas, no mexican guy. we then walked around downtown. i got pants. i went home and praticed the trombone which i can sort of play now. i can almost go along with the planet smashers... a bit, well, not really at all. then i went out and got a (ugh) manicure. thanks mom, but i don't enjoy having coated nails. plus the lady was mean. she kept on telling me jokes in Hong Kong language and would glare at me when i didn't laugh. *sigh* i then went to rachelle's party. lots of fun. andrea (false!!!), WE HAD AN AWESOME TIME. and no, kristin, polar bear on the ice does not make sense. then, movie. (ya killin' me, ya really killin' me here). sleep and as of 3, i'm home. now, to practice the trombone again. and clean my room. and possibly do stuff with friends. anyways, later, i may post again.

      my, my!!! i am sooooo outdated! in the blog business anyways. my christmas was okay. the actual day felt like christmas eve. but all was good. on boxing day, heather and jenna came over. jenna and i had a m&m fight, it was fun. then my family went to my mom's friends family for dinner. the next day, i went shopping (yay!!) and got clothes. i went to crystal's birthday party. the next night/day (sorta) i had some people over. um... then the next day (as in yesterday) i had a family christmas with my mom's side. SOOOO many people came! my family is big! and i got a lot of presents! my cousin's boyfriend is hot. i went to skye's after for a bit cause he was having a "get together". matt looked SOOOOOOO extremely, very hot. i just stared at him, like the whole time. he looked really nicccce, i think his shirt may have been a major factor. meh! regardless, he was certainly my eye-candy. today i want to go see peter pan with heather because the guy in it is HOT! and then the library, stupid noah hasn't called me yet and i have no way (well i have a couple but i'm lazy) to contact him, so he'll fail, and i won't. oh well, later. bekah *kisses*

      this is soooo stupid. i just spent a frickin million minutes writing a post and it didn't work!!!! so, ya, on saturday night lana came over a we watched pirates of the blah blah blah. johnny depp is seriously frickin hot mate! sunday i went to smithville (niagara) and i was going to stay over and visit a bit, but i didn't because i felt sick. yesterday i was at lesley's house from 9:00a.m. to 9:30p.m. that's 12 1/2 hours!!! good thing i love her! contrary to my very strong beliefs, i went to the mall (twice). i saw so many people i know there. i wish i was a mute. then i wouldn't have to deal with socializing. i got all my shopping done and i spent wayyyy too much money (there goes our house kids!). but that's okay. i saw 'something's gotta give'. it was jam-packed with old people and non-working dicks. i kept on making inappropriate and stupid (yet extremely funny) remarks and my friend swere laughing soooo hard. i think the old people were angry at me though. some tough grandma's gave me dirty looks. i found out that (sadly) they still consider me a fan club and worse, LESLIE part of it. which is TOTALLY false. argh. today, my grandma is picking me up and doing christmas food shopping. i'm taking my little sister (who i'm babysitting) to LOTR 3, because i promised. then at night i get to bake my brains out. my mother is a slave-driver. *sigh* naw, baking is cool. as long as i don't turn out to be a kitchen bitch, lol, andrea. anyways, i must go. because my grandma might have a heart attack if she sees my pj's. love, not hate brother. bekah.:)*love*

      okay, i meant dogs, not gods int the last post. well... i had lana over on saturday night and i saw pirates of the blah blah blah for my first time. johnny depp is so frickin hot. seriously mate!!! lol. orlando bloom is to full of himself, he's over-rated in that movie. on sunday i traveled to smithville (niagara) with my sister and mother. i was supposed to stay there for a bit, but i said i was sick. i went to lesley's for soooo long yesterday. 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. that's... 12 1/2 hours!!! good thing i love her, lol. contrary to my strong beliefs, i went to the mall (twice). but i got all my shopping done. i spent too much money, which is okay. i saw JORDAN! he is very hot. i like that he doesn't have teeth, it's cute. hmm, i saw tons of people, i don't know how i know so many people. molly and liz. i played soccer with liz, she's not very nice. noah, bethan. and those two stupid people outside the door spitting. i saw the movie 'something's gotta give' with jenna, lesley and crystal. it was funny in an old-people-kind-of-way. i kept on saying these stupid little comments. everyone i nthe theatre could hear, and they were funny. i think the old people might have been mad at the end though. today, i'm babysitting my sister. i promise to take her to see lord of the rings 3. i'll probably fall asleep. then i have to cook for christmas because my mom is a slave driver. i'm not bored because i have a lot to do. but i fell... somehow unaccomplished. i think my brother got a snowbord for christmas, it's not fair that he's in calgary and i'm not. meh. i miss him. bye for now, bekah.*love*

      didn't go off with lesley. and harry completely ignored me. i would say that i had a bad day.. except i don't know if i did. if was like a dream a lucid dream. i was there but i wasn't, everything that happened didn't. i went to london... bought new clothes and stuff, the whole entire drive (there and back), i didn't talk at all. i might have been thinking, i don't know. it was weird, i was sleepign but i wasn't. i felt so.. empty and non-existent. it must have been a lucid dream. nothing else makes sense, besides depression which i'm pretty sure i don't have.

      today was alright... iwas in a freaky mood. it was so funny, i finally ripped this mask off the wall today and started singing this song. omg... it was funny. and kyla is such a geek-out, she is so funny! rahcelle was in a weird mood too. i'm happy when i realize that i'm thirsty and then i look beside me and i find a very convient perfectly melted slushie!!!! i was happy i smiled and no one was there. i have TONS of laundry to do. hey... guess what! if i get over 60% on my math and geography on my mid-term i can get my tongue pierced! i told my mom we get mid-terms in may but we get them in three days. i'm sneaky. but she'll prolly say no, or something equally dumb. i haven't done a nice, actual blog in a while. know what i have to say to that?.............. TOO FRICKIN' BAD!!! sorry, lol. i would love to see people's faces right now. andrea and cory. best of luck in math class. speaking of which, it was so funny, because when i failed (yet another) math test, (since i wrote (cause she failed too) 'well aren't you a frickin genius' on hers) rachelle wrote under my score 'you forgot the frickin' date. and it was really funny cause mr. bloton crossed out frickin on both ours papers. we laughed so hard. yup, well, i'm out, of town, if ya know what i mean.

      well, i tried to do dishes today with a rubber glove and the stupid thing ripped when it hit my cast. i wonder how sumo wrestlers (cause they have really fat arms like me with my cast) who don't like to get their hands wet, do dishes. sucks to be them (and me). i was sort of surprised cause i actually like blink-182's new stuff. it's not bad. i respect all music because i respect all artist's and their work (that doesn't mean i like the music though) and rap isn't so horrible. it requires a lot of talent to make those lyrics that actually make sense and have a message. dunno about ludacris, but emeniem's lyrics are pretty damn good. so, i slept for 15 hours last night. my brain is so messed up. how cani s leep that long? i'm a weirdo. lol. yup, i should go do my laundry so i can pack for ottawa. oh ya, and guess what? i dunno how to work the links so you'll have to suffer. sorry, i'll get someone to show me sometime. by the way. jon, rachelle, lesleym jenna and brianne. yesterday was so funny. rachelle it's your frickin fault it landed in the toilet!!!! dude... what happened yesterday? i don't even remeber... lol! later all you buttheads with a better life than RACHELLE = LOSER! no, i love you baby. bye.

(in this little 'you stinker' voice)   me: "ya, now go to sleep."  so, yup, i should sleep, and i will, later at least. bye homies. *kiss* bekah

      alright, maybe not all the time cause guess what! computer genius me... seems to have messed it up and i now have a frickin virus, which is shitty. i feel, weird. if you know me, call me sometime and then i'll hang up and then you can call again and then listen to my answering machine, which is the shit becuase i recorded it in a texan accent. kristin's screaming in the background too. rachelle and jon are bums. that is all, no, lol. tommorow morning i'm off to the market (with Heather) to get a fantabulous present for my mom, then off to the G-Unit's (grandparents, lol!) for her birthday party. ummm... ya, then going for a mother-daughter weekend woo-pee. after that i'm moving furniture and painting with friends. heather and i are growing apart which sucks. but maybe in ottawa we'll go back to being the shiznit again. tetris is so freakin awesome, dude, play it. i need some good music. but i can't find anything to play it on and i'm scared to wake everyone up (it's like, 3:00 in the morning and my motha is a BEAST). maybe i should go to bed... hmmm... no. this is the first time in forever that i haven't actually liked someone, it's not weird, but w/e, different. tonight was funny;  "i'm running away! everyone hates me here and no one listens!" my sobbing little sister yells down the stairs.  "good. do you want some money?" my mom (so cruel)  "ahhhhhhhhhhh" *crying* *crying* "i hate you!" my sister  "well then, you better get going." my still unloving mother.  *absolutely quiet*  "mom... i can't find my duffel bag. do i have to go?" my quiet little sister.   "no, i guess you can stay" mom.  "alrighty then, can we go grocery shopping now?" me; confused.  my family is so meesed up. you know what? i'm glad i'm not addicted to anything bad for me, and i'm glad i'm not really fat (well i am a bit, but i'm talking SUMO here) or really skinny or sucidal. and i'm really frickin glad i have a family. damn am i glad for that. even if they're all retarded in a loveable way. well, tetris calls (and so should you for my answering machine!). so, in deep love, i part, to my tetris, then to my bed that is currently covered in laundry i have to fold. longest blog for a while, eh? see what boredom does... GAH!!!! sleep+tetris await. later, bekah *a kiss and a hug!* (if you have a slave or man/woman whore who do all your bidding, get a massage too)

      you know when you have really good days. you wake up and feel like shit so mom says stay home and sleep through gym and geography, then go to school. so you go to school and meet up with konrad, austin-rae and eric, which is sweet and you all go have lunch. then you go to the office later and the office accepts your way late two notes for past absences and that makes you happy too. english isn't so bad. person you helped gets an okay mark and another person who has to redo the assignment asks for your help. so english is fine. then there's math. which was okay, and you get in a tiny tiff but are quickly over it and you leave happy. take the bus and successfully (besides that someone you're pissed at is around, but you avoiding them sort of). watch a really funny bitch fight in between two guys. walk home and change into summer clothes cause it's such a nice day. skip with a jumping rope and laze around for a while. kristin comes over and we walk out for ice cream and we go on swings. we have lots of fun and i realize how awesome she is.  get home and see how late it is. my mom's not home yet. she's supposed to drive kristin home. krtistin's mom calls. kristin is grounded and we can't have a sleep over tomorrow and i can't go to her house and/or go to luc's to see his kittens. kristin's mom pulls up and comes to the door. i open it and try to explain that my mom is late. totally gets shut down and yelled at. kristin's mom is very angry. start feeling like shit and wander off. then feel gross because i ate too much. then fall into my uncommon but when it's there, it's bad, self-hate mode which will prolly still be on tomorrow. now as my family fights stupidly i also feel more shitty because, as the doomed middle child i am ignored and generally brushed off. now going to my room where i can lie in my bed for three hours because i have insomnia. later. oh yea, and i have a doctor's appointment for next week to get sleeping pills. sleep tight, i won't.

      dylan started a blog. i skipped soccer and ultimate today because i had to babysit. as always. don't get me wrong, i like the money but really, i feel like i'm living there, and not at my house. for the record... dylan's blog sucks. no, i'm joking. i don't not like natty anymore. i did at the beginning of the year. actually, i don't hate anyone, with the exception of like, three cases of intense dislike. i feel like i have too much to do. my tongue is almost the same. except it gets tired and stops pronouncing 's's. so i sound like a ssssnake. i hate ms. s. so much. what is her problem. you can tell that she secretly hates me too and tried SO hard to conceal it, but it comes out like a fat lady in a size 2

      BAD: you find a porn video in your sons room -----   WORSE: your in it  BAD: your children are sexually active ------   WORSE: with eachother  GOOD: you go see a strip show with the guys -----    BAD: your daughters the star-----   WORSE: shes turning your friends on  GOOD: your daughters on the pill -------   BAD: shes 10  GOOD: your neighbour exersises in the nude --------   BAD: he weighs 350 pounds ------    WORSE: he turns you on                       Which is worse?       Your mom wearing a thong....  or your dad wearing a speedo!?  You knowing your parents had sex ..... your parents knowing you had sex!?  Changing 100 babies diapers....changing your grandmas diaper?!  Your boy/girl friend picking his nose............your boy/girl friend picking ur nose?!       What does a old woman have between her tits that a young woman doesnt? A BELLY BUTTON!  You know you're in a redneck hotel when you tell them "I've got a leak in my sink and they say........"GO AHEAD!"  Your mamma's so poor when she goes to the park the ducks throw bread at her.  Two blonds are driving to Wonderland. They see a sign that says  "WONDERLAND LEFT" so they went home.  Why is it when a man talks nasty to a woman it's sexual harrasment, but when a woman talks nasty to a man it's 3.99 a hour!    since i was confined to the walls of my house until i have a draft for my immigration project, it looks like i'm working while i'm really just finding cheesy shit on the internet.

      this morning i woke up to a crash of thunder. since the whole attic is my room and the rain was coming down really hard it was awesome. i love rain and i could have stayed there forever... but i got hungry. it's really cool though, sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night to rain, and i garauntee it's the best way to wake up. i'm off, go outside, like me, it's  a nice day.

      whre the hell did the word 'bimbo' come from... really, who thinks that up? i thought of another cool word, fuddlebum... that's messed up. you know what song i actually really like which is surprising me? adam's song by blink-182 and also 'my bloody valentine' by good charlotte i normally hate their shit. although blink's new cd is pretty good. and then there's the classic that everyone likes, the goldfinger remake of '99 red balloons' which is sweet and also 'lucy in the sky with diamonds' which is debatable that the content is LSD by the beatles. they're all pretty good. 'a girl in class' by himsa takes the cake. also, check out '44 caliber love letter' by alexisionfire. and i'm out.

      marielle says that you get yeast infections if you masturbate with french breadsticks... she would know... she is french.  kristin isn't sexy at all and she's not awesoem whatsoever. in fact, i hate kristin and i don't want anything to do with her. the fact that she's sitting besdie watching me type this and giggling... is just cause she stalks me. well... we are off to my house now because her house is contaminated. by the way... english really, really sucks. we have an awesome ad for class though. and kayli makes the best hick ever! i must leave. i'm sort of bored... kristin is tryign to hurt her father who just got out of the hospital. oh the soap-opera-ness of it. later stupid people in sweden who all look alike. and to all you good ol' Candians (note first capital in like.. ever; i am proud of being Canadian) good night. drink cammomile tea. it's liek sleeping pills just not as good and it makes you pee if you don't fall asleep after a while. bye.  oh yes... i learned how to play 'drunken sailor' which is only two chords (i am just sooo musical)  on the electric guitar. acoustic is hard on the fingers. i am quite good at it.

        it is 4 in the morning. i think i just won't go to bed, i'll go to school and i'll get my gym project done. then i'll have gym, then in geography, i'll talk to mr. dumas about the three sections of the project i've missed so far and what i've done. i will then proceed to math (extra help during lunch) where i have missed an entire unit and deparately try to catch up. then i have english, i will sit and suffer the weirdly sweet smiles of ms.s. then i'll return to math and re-enter my world of oblivion. i'm go home and crash. i'll be sick and tired and over-stressed the whole weekend. then i will return to my awesome cycle on monday. who can fill two pages of french general facts on canada. yea, baby, just watch me do it.

         conversation with my mom:  mom: why do you have a juice can on your forehead? me: i dunno my face is burning mom: well take off the sweater and blanket me: can't, my body's cold mom: oh no *runs for thermometer* *checks, it's 101* mom: i'm going to bed, take your temperature every once in a while, if it hits 104 call 911, and wake me up  nice mom eh? oh, my kid's dying... boy i should go to bed!  no, i bet it won't hit 104. apparently if it does something bad happens. why am i drinking hot chocolate... oh right! because i'm a fuckhead!!! why do i do this to myself? i build myself into this little world. full of paranoia and failure. i can't do anything right. i have a disability. no one gets it. my best friend. they all don't know what it's like, or who i really am. there's more to me that a funny face. there's the side that wonders why i'm here, if what i do has a point. why should i carry on void of opportunity. i sit, with no purpose, the stacks of work, pointless, beside me, no matter how hard i work, how much i try to please. it doesn't work. all i do is fall deeper into depth of my uselessness. anyways. ricki lake sucked today too. know what is was? it was an episode on people that have been cheated on who take revenge and lie and tell their partners that they've been fucking everyone in town to see their reaction. dumb. that's the first time i've not likes ricki lake. i miss the dragqueens. tom's right, stimulate is a good song. it remids me of an alien techno world... somehow, don't ask. by the way, everyone get 'all falls down' by kayne west and lauren hill, sort of how i feel now. and uh, don't get all worried or whatever, i'm fine. later babes, bekah.

      this morning i woke up at 11:30, that's what my clock said. not too bad, so i got up. i was tricked... sometime during the night i was hitting buttons in my sleep, i went downstairs and it was really 9:00... horrible.     in a conversation during breakfast where we discuss the people my sister will be staying with while she has a conference for work:    Mom:  do you think she'd be happy there?   Rebekah:  yea, they have playboy... *awkward silence* erm... i mean playstation   Mom:  *drops her toast* what are you thinking about!?    after i told mom to do her dishes before her nails:    Mom:  bossy, bossy girl   Rebekah:  foolish, foolish girl   Mom:  you're funny, trying to tell me what to do   Rebekah:  *raises eyebrows and leaves the table*    heather (friend) and i took pictures on friday night, after seeing one on the computer:    Rebekah:  heather's really pretty eh mom?   Mom:  yes... that's why i don't get why you call her chubby all day   Rebekah:  *smirks* no mom, i mean my friend heather, my sister is chubby   in conclusion, i will never have breakfast with my mom again. it was funny though.  also, i'm IN LOVE with thunderstorms. i was listening to it last night while trying to sleep. i was kept awake until 4 in te morning. i went outside yesterday night and i stodd in the rain for a while. i love it!!!!!! anyways, i'm off, rebekah.

         heather woke me up at like, 9:00 this morning on the phone. i think i'm going through an anti-social phase. i don't really feel like being around people... ever again. besides i have insane amounts of homework. i figured out how to post images, i think. first i have to upload them from my computer onto my msn profile. then i have to post the picture url and hopefully it'll work but it will take forever.

      she threw her head back and tried to sing gospel. YES LORD, I CAN FEEL IT!!!!!!!! ahhh... the love bubbling inside! she is so retarted... she's going to end up like the picture. yes, that means SHE WILL shrink, and change colour and get a really gay costume, she will also grow wings. we watched thirteen tonight, it was so screwed up, it was actually pretty scary. pretty good. weird, but good, she's staying over and we are hitting the sack soon. NO, not sexually, *wink wink* we are going to the market tomorrow. i love heather. her kids will be beautiful. you suck jeff.

      i promised mysalf that although i'm really bored i wouldn't blog, BUT, as i was innocently watching ricki lake i saw THE most hilarious thing!!! today was a drag-queen makeover special. and one of them looked exactly like leslie de martigny. i'm not kidding. it was the funiest thing ever! good thing that it was after her makeover, but she still looked like this... *click on link which is title*   awww.... there's a double episode of ricki lake (yay!) and i felt really bad for this guy who got cheated on. he walked off crying, i would've too if my partner had fucked my brother, my roomate, given oral to my dad, had sex with 3 people she met over the internet and made out and exchanged oral with approx. 30 people in the last 8 months. ricki lake is my idol. god, i'm so bored.

      dylan sounded so sad. sweetheart... i love you!!!! you know how everyone is always like, 'heh, heh, i faked sick, dude, like i totally got away with it' well they all suck. HAH! this is sad. me blogging al the time. no ricki lake, no montel, no nothing. just me and... wow, look at that, ME. if i were to interview myself a year ago, i think i would just walk away after the first phony 'hey!' came from my mouth. i was such an idiot. the things i thought about. and cared about! so stupid. i have come to a conclusion. people can look at me, and judge me and talk about me all they want. i won't take it to heart. unless i really like/love them and they mean something to me... i don't care. everyone is the same when it comes down to it. what i think we need in the world is more homer simpson's. anyways, feel better dylan. and yes, sleep is good.  bekah oh yea, did i mention my team won 4-1 on wednesday with me in net second half (i didn't let the goal in) my coach put me in net even though i think i was dying. stupid.

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEN!!!!!!!!!!   my day was pretty mediocre (real word? i dunno). i really hate school, i try to avoid going every single day but it just doesn't work. so i took the bus to school... wow. i saw this guy that i hadn't seen in a while. pretty sweet. got to school and i was late. i like lauren, she's awesome. lunch was fine, sort of feel bad that i turned austin-rae down, but sometimes i just don't fucking feel like going off. hahaha!!! funny. so, i dwadled my way to english and have discovered that as a young baby ms. s's father felt need to shove peanuts up her nose which explains the odd rattling and stupidity nowadays. i really, seriously can't stand her. if i had it in me to fight someone she'd be first in line. um, math wasn't that great. spent have my time wandering the halls with kyla and then the other half listening to luc, eric and andy argue over how long sex takes. i think 45 seconds was the last one. then we tried to catch the bus but didn't and took the city. alas, chris wasn't there. we took the bus home and the FUNNIEST thing ever happened!!!!! we were sitting and all of a sudden i looked over. there was this old man with a huge smile across his face and his finger was digging so deep into his nose. he was really making an effort. it was gross. then he ate he. he kept on going in for more and eating it. got it was great. i got off laughing and didn't stop. ahhhh... it was great. anyways. bye.

      let's see. on friday i went on a plane ride. lots of fun. on friday night i had some people over, went for ice cream and a movie (have you ever tried to jam 16 people into a tiny living room??) cabin fever is the worst fucking movie imaginable. it's just so horrible and bad and did i say totally fake? regardless, all was good and lots of fun. then, dun-dun-da-da!!! i volunteered at 8 o'clock in the FREAKING MORNING with kristin. we shovelled hay all day. we met these three irish guys, ricky, anthony and shitbreak. i like shitbreak the best and anthony looked SO much like pippin it scared me. anyways, irish people kick ass... when they were talking about smoking they said fags right? all i could think of was a carton of men standing around slapping each other's asses. and they say what's crackin instead of what's up. they say pissed instead of smashed and they always cross their arms. i love their accents. i'm marryin myself a wee irish man. hopefully not wee... because my sister is currently almost dying i'm going to visit her in the hospital. i hope all is good. i love her so her dying right now would not be so cool. ah... got to go. peace, love and empathy. ~the bombe~ bekah

      uh, well. last night my bed got too hot so i got up and slept on my windowsill (which is pretty big) by the window (duh). in the morning my mom couldn't find me. i woke up at 6. i went to the doctor's and talked forever. i had to tell him about stuff like if i've ever done drugs or drank and stuff like that. it's really none of his business, but he has to know. next week i start anti-depressants. i'm not depressed, actually, not at all, it's because a huge side effect of the medecine is drowsiness. all i have to do is take it an hour before i sleep. then i went to school. lunch was boring, as always. i really don't like ms. s. i really REALLY don't like her. i almost hate her. mark is the fucking most annoying kid in that class but ms. s. is a crazy ass bitch. i don't really like her. she needs kids or something. um, then i had math. the supply teacher was so trippy, he could bug his eyes out and do this awesome thing with his arms. i got absolutely no work done. ever since he moved me beside kyla, i haven't gotten anything done at all. i'm so stupid. i am honestly, the stupidest person, not just in school, outside too. i'm just dumb! then we had soccer, we tied Fergus 3-3, hard fucking game. they had 11 subs and we had 2. we played without annie, elyshia, emily, amy and jess, five of our best players. my shins were going to crack, honestly, i got off the field and i was wobbling. but whatever. this is the only game that we haven't won.  rachelle's sandals made my feet hurt. i went to the paisley road dessert party for about 10 minutes. it was okay. all those english girls are such whores... really, what's their fucking problem? their point in life is... what? to see how many times they can get fucked before they have a kid or get an STD. or maybe to see how fast they can ruin their bodies by having smoking/snorting contests. so stupid. i think this qualifies as a real blog. so i'm off to sit alone and put atheletic heat rub on my shins.  remember dawgz, represent the motherfuckin' block. (if you don't have that song 'my block'-tupac yet... get it) rebekah    oh yea, guess what. my (older) sister is REALLY REALLY sick. she might not be allowed back in school. she could die and shit. it's freaking me out.

      "Bombing For Peace Is Like Fucking For Virginity" i am such a fucking procrastinator. today my older sister said that a family dinner with us is like the final wrestlemania. but she loves us and she had fun. this weekend was mildly fucked up (well okay, really weird, but i won't elaborate). there's another geography project that marielle and i made really sad attempts at working on that's due tomorrow. i bought 6 goldfish for it (for prettiness) they are name bob #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 (R.I.P) number 6 died. oh well. 5 to go. i just thought of something! what if thwy die while i'm at school? i guess i don't care that much. altogether they only cost 88 cents. i better go finish research on fish farming. i don't think i'll get any laundry or sleep tonight.  love, peace and empathy -- as kurt cobain would say. rebekah

      lana's party = meh.   i can't wait til i have my absolutely fabulous party. i know, if you want to come, comment (funny because everyone's away and no one reads this, so no one will). i'll invite you anyways. now... to have drinking or not, i'm not sure. i have to get my mom out.   i saw monster tonight. scary, i hardly ever realized that hookers had feelings.   i feel... like being on a ferris wheel. i honestly do. i wish i could take someone who i won't say with me, and just go around and around and stare at the stars.   either that or pissed drunk. but the first sounds nicer.  love, ~bekah~ kristin.... *crying* i hate france

      so uh, i went to kara lee's. i came home and i went to heather's. we watched requim for a dream. it's really sad, and twisted, scary-like. then we watched euro trip. it was pretty funny. uh, i slept over and had to come home to do my little sister's make-up for her little "grade 6 graduation". my older sister fucked up on her hair big time. but i didn't say anything... i should've done her hair too. i mean, i'm not a girly girl, but i'm pretty good at doing make-up and hair, as long as it's not mine. so now i'm sitting at the computer, very, very early in the morning. i have lana's party to go to. not that excited though... woo hoo. then tomorrow i have skye's little shindig. i dunno what after that. i'm so sleepy! i'm going to force kristin to come over. oh yea, good luck to all you leaving people!!!!!1 i'm going to have absolutely no friends. loner rebekah coming up! well, come back from your foreign destinies with a damn good souvenir for the poor little girl back home (me). ~bekah~

      today, i plan on doing many things. first of all i was horribly and rudely awaken twice around the un-godly hour of 10:30 a.m. my stupid "friends" had to call (just joking guys). um, yea, i'm kind of in a crappy mood. remeber how when i was sick... i felt really weird and bad. i think it's coming back, or it never really left. so today i go to camp orientation because i'm volnteering at rainbow daycamp this summer. then i go to kara lee's. apparently there's a lot of other people going.  then i don't know what i'm doing. most likely nothing. i need to get the other harry potter books from kristin, cause i need them before she goes away on saturday. i will miss her so much. stupid... france. taking all my friends away. honestly... everyone is going away to france. everyone. so i'll have my party in early august. later, bekah.

HAH! then kristin rolled in dog shit by accident. that was hilarious. also she took off her shirt in the car and there was a whole bus load of guys in front of us. rachelle went home and kristin and i walked around. we sat down on a street corner. i went home the next day and showered and changed and stuff. then heather and i orgainized a party. bye.

      ben told this to me, it's hilarious:  there was a man, who's wife had been really sick for about three years. she was in a coma and there were no signs of her ever waking up again. the doctor's told him he had to make a decision, the only rational one was too pull the plug. the man went in her hospital room to say good-bye. he kissed her lips softly as a farewell and she moaned. he ran out very excited yelling "doctor! doctor! she moaned!!" the doctor told him that moaning was a very good sign and the doctor told the man to take it to the next step. the man asked what that was and the doctor replied, "oral sex". the man gave him an odd look but said okay and returned to the room. ten minutes he walked out slowly, "doctor, my wife is dead." he said. the doctor was shocked, "what? what happened?"  "well," the man said, "i think she choked."   soooo funny!

      the most hilarious day ever. first i skipped gym (don't ask me why) well, it's cause heather hates geography and that's what she has first. we stayed downtown and went to see if i could get a shorter barbell for my tongue, but stigmata was closed. fuck, i hate school, honestly. anyways, lunch was fine. but i felt so sick by then. then i almost went home in english but stayed because of rachelle. in math everybody was talking, then everyone went quiet and that's when i chose to yell out to kyla. 'no you retard, you don't squeeze, you suck!' well it sounded really bad, but i only said that cause she squeezed my apple juice and it went everywhere. then i went to rachelle's. we watched sabrina and the fresh prince of bel air, then i fell asleep on her. in her room we both went with the intention to sleep, but ended up throwing stuff at each other. so funny, we were flexing our bums and putting them in the air to see how funny it looked. we also dressed up, i had this wide flowery belt across my head, rachelle had purple soccer socks, little shorts on over her jeans and duckers on. ahahaha, it was fun. then we went bowling. i love wes! he is the greatest! he is honestly the best. i dunno... jon was acting sorta weird. and by the way kristin, he can't go to your cottage. wes, rachelle and i went down to dollar hub. it rocked.

       hey. spent some time with my sister tonight. i was on her msn, but she was right there. and yea, because of my extensive knowledge of nirvana, she got to know this guy really well. too bad she has a boyfriend already. i'm going to try superhard to be a good influence and be nice to her, because from what i see in her now (and she's in grade 6) if we're not careful she's gonna turn into a real bad ass. anyways, leaving in the wee hours for a bike ride with her. by the way. my mom said yes to going to kris's cottage for a week and two weekends. sweetness. gotta go save my baby angel, wish me luck. peace, love and empathy, *bekah*   p.s. had an amazing time downtown

      Hey, what's up? Hah, I kind of missed a couple days... Mostly cause Kristin came home. Well then... On Sunday my family and I went to the beach and had a blast. I got a horrible sunburn! So on Monday, Kristin and I biked over to play tennis with Andrea and heather. It ended when Andrea yelled at me and told me to fuck off... Then we went back to my house. We chilled there and Kristin slept over. Then the next day we biked around and played tennis, and then we went to her house where we hung out with Rachelle and went biking some more. Then we headed back to Kristin's and had the massivest funnest waterfight ever!!!! Then yea, Rachelle went home, Kristin and I went to Tim Horton's and then went home. Then the next morning (this morning!) I went to VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL to be a crew leader with Wesley. And it was fun... I played with little kids! I loved it so much! Then I got home, had a nap and was woken up by the carpet cleaners. So then I biked to Kristin's and we biked to Zehrs were we got milkshakes. And then we biked to the West End Rec. Center were we applied to volunteer at summer camp (I'm going to have so many hours! Cause I already have 26 and I'm doing 2 more summer camps). Then we went back to her house, ate dinner and went to my house. She came to my soccer game, which I lost (2-1) and I busted my ankle. Anyways!!! The last couple of days have been amazing and awesome, but I have to get back on the tennis court. Andrea, can we please, please play games, or try to?!  Alright, tomorrow morning I go off to my bible camp or fucking whatever. Then I get home and go to Kristin's... where we hang around and hopefully go on her roof. So Andrea, we have to play tennis. And I'm going to Kristin's cottage for the weekend. So Eric, we'll write you your letter that we already started there, okay! Ummm... plus my mom finally got my birth certificate so tomorrow I'm gonna go get my Socilal Insurance Number so I can work! Which is good cause then I can make money! I have to get my sleep, so I'm off... Love, **bekah**  P.S. Notice the nice capital letters and proper spelling and all that? Oh yea! I tried!

      do you know what it's like... to go jogging at midnight. in the park. there are trees all around you. and you are completely in the dark. no one else is there. but everything you hear. every twitch, every tiny sound. your heartbeat is pounding and you can almost see someone creeping out. watching you, in secret, in the darkness. the fear is over-powering, and as a result i may have run the fastest (except at last years championship soccer game) in my life.   sometimes i wonder if i'm doing enough with my life. if i died tomorrow, would i be satisfied? what i want to do, is grab my mom's keys and run outside for a joyride. what i will do.. is go upstairs to bed. how depressing. but what can i do? all i am... is another colour in the pretty picture.  -red- ~bekah~

      ha, guess what rebekah did today? well, first of all, yesterday was excellent. and so much fun. LOL, i love being with heather and andrea, because they're crazy... but i do miss my kris fix (ie:kristin, if you read this, get it... because i'm on heroin, eh? eh?. so yea, we have a lot of fun ant andrea's and we were vair, vair nuts indeed. they are getting bikini waxes or brazilian... jealousy. and then heather and i went and got frozen yoghurt, watched hot chick. and she slept over. whew! i got 65%  exactly  on my report card for geography. my average was 71... haha. i got 55 in math and he recommended me for applied next year, bastard. then i went from an 87 to an 80 in english. probably because i FUCKING hate (well intensely dislike) ms. s. and.. 85 in gym, good, i mean because i broke my arm and because i was out sick for 3 weeks. so, yes, i called lesley because her comment sounded kinda desparate. and shannon commented... and shannon, i'll prolly be having my party at the very end of august. okay? it might be a couple days before school... so hopefully you're allowed to stay over.  um, roight. so today, i woke up at 1, when andrea called me, apparently she'd been calling all morning, oops. and (heather went home earlier) my mom took me to andrea's house (not before she left me at pharma plus... my mom is a crazy nut ball). then lesley, heather, andrea and i went to play tennis. it was awesome. we saw mike and conner on the way. then we went back and swam. we tried playing this underwater game where we talk. but no one got it really. i mean, "homosexual" was difficult as was "sex" and "boobs" and "stick that in your cunt and smoke it". lol. then i went home amd am sitting on my bum. tomorrow; i'm playing tennis with andrea (i think) and then lesley and heather are watching me playing my soccer game. then i sleep over at lesley's and play lots of lovely pool, which i suck at. so this is really long. i'm guessing. only 5 more days for kristin to come back!!!!! luc wants to do something the 11th, the night she gets back. but he's an ass, and banned from my house unless he wants an ass-kicking. so unless he does something impressing. too bad. love, ~bekah~  oh yes.. by the way  sexes, is someone/somthing that makes you horny and bothered. sex.. is yes.. well... you know, the dirty deed.  there eric, i hope it was good! i tried to entertain you.

      boohoo. i woke up really early for me. 8 in the morning. my stomach hurts. it does... it's like i have to pee, but i don't. just thought i'd share that with you, haha. kara lee and maddie are on their way back. thank god kristin has a computer in her new hotel in FRANCE. and lana just got back from the east coast. andrew and heather are going away at the same time. i think i might have to have my party at the end of august, like a couple days before school starts. we'll see, but i do have to have one. i'm going with heather to get my report card today, then we're going to andrea's to swim. if i don't have 65% or higher for my geography mark i'm supposed to take my tongue ring out. fat chance. fuck that. i'm reading the fifth harry potter now. get "i'm ready for love" by the couting crows. i like it, it's cool. anyways. later... comment, if you can. kristin says the comps in france amd england are fucked up and won't let her. meh. i miss her.

      what's up? so yesterday i went shopping with heather. holy shit... yea i got a lot of stuff. um, then we went to her house and watched crazy/beautiful and cruel intentions. they were both pretty good movies. i don't get why i can't fucking sleep at other people's houses. i'm always up way later than them. anyways! i came home this morning and my sister and i fought. it was kind of funny. she was running around and she jumped on my back and start humping me and i was yelling at her to get the fuck off. i hate fucking dressing up and having to wear a stupid skirt for family reunions. plus this side of the family is so rich and prissy. it's in some faggoty-ass hotel that costs too much and the food is like fancy, and gross. jay hernandez and ryan phillipe are the hottest guys ever, and josh hartnet. yes josh hartnet. i wish i didn't have to go to this stupid reunion, the old men ask you to dance, and you have to. thank god my brother's going or i'd prolly end up killing a bunch of old people. and my 6th cousin or something is kinda hot. NO IT'S NOT INCEST, HE'S MY SIXTH COUSIN!!!!! and tomorrow i'm going to the beach! yay!!! with my cousin, family and heather!! i do not want to go to sudbury, but my mom won't drive to brooklyn. stupid, crazy, retardo mother. shout out to ERIC stuck with the hot hillbilly stupid girls and the smoking fags. good luck in summer school!!!!!! anyways, grandparents are here and lemonades done. later alligator! love, ~bekah~

      i've come up with something, it's easy to say, but it's hard to live by. in whatever you do, be happy. let's say if you had worked really hard all your life and you stil only managed to scrape by, i still think that if a trip to hawaii may not be logical because you'd blow all your money... if it makes you happy, go for it. i'd much rather die poor and happy than rich and miserable. when you think about it. how much does money matter? not at all. sure... it's nice to look good and to have nice things. like brands names and extra toys. but how will that help you when someone's hurting, when someone's crying, when someone's in need. so, in the end, when i really think about, i'm glad i was born poor with parents who understand what's really important. all people are equal... no matter which one has more money.   sorry for going all deep. but yea, i spent sometime with people who have a very different idea of happiness than i do. uh, yesterday i went to andrea's and we went swimming, lots of boobs involved (freaky). then we headed on over to riverside park. guess what... yes, there was a ferris wheel!!!! but... my friends thought it was too expensive (it was, it cost 3$) and i didn't get to go on it. we saw lots of people that we know or did know... or recognize. ben p. died his hair and he looks really fucking hot with it. well then ,we watched fireworks (andrea, heather, alexa, me, andrew, cory and even nathan kinda). i went home and then this morning i went out to breakfast with heather and her grandparents and mom. i'm home now andi just got up to answer the phone and i kind of fell over. not really, but i was just going to sit back down and i fell onto the stool. i'd know what i'd like right now... to be  b l a z e d. lots of love, ~bekah~

      hey babes. i'm back. yea that's right.. shake the house down. speaking of which. my porch is pretty.  i loved kristin's cottage minus the cowell's. but it was so much fun. then i went to sauble and we met two guys... who surprisingly are brothers. one's a year older than me and one's a year older than emily. so we hung out with them. and they live in guelph. which was a surprise. i'm in love with sauble. like... IN LOVE. i missed so many people when i was away. one of which.. my brother, but i saw him and gave him clothes i bought him. by the way i have so many new clothes. kind of sad really. but amazingly cool. and i miss andrea. and i miss heather. and i miss rachelle. and now i miss kristin, but not as much as others... well maybe as much as rachelle, lol. and i miss brianne. and eric, i've written to you and i'm on my second page! hah! ... i miss tennis and soccer. maybe i'll go play some now before heather comes over. oh my god do i miss her. and i can't wait to see andrea. i came back a couple days early. but i think i'm going to my grandparents for a couple of days to help my brother deal with their retardedness. oh yea.. i have a pretty good tan for me. it's not like, sexellent or anything. but it's alright. thanks for the emails guys. see you soon guys. love, *bekah*
