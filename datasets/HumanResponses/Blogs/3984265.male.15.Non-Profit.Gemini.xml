       i think i know what day it is, for the first time in months, for some reason i just know that today is monday. whoo hoo. today i dint do much, ssdd mostly. my lil bro's faggot friend mat came ovr and hes sleepin ovr too. i accidently locked myself in the back of my moms pt cruiser and was stuck for like 5 mitues, i had to call my house on my cell. and last night i tore some muscles in my groin when i tryed to roundhouse kick my mother in the face. so ive done a lot of stupid shit recently. i been played video games on my comp most of the day and thats about it. here yuh go!   -  I PIERCE MY PENIS WITH CORKSCREWS EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I SLEEP.   -  FOR EVERY $10 I MAKE, I RIP OFF 5 HAIRS FROM MY BALLS. THIS TEACHES ME MANY THINGS. #1) TO BE AFRAID OF WEALTH. AND #2) THAT MAKING MONEY WILL RESULT IN ME POINTLESSLY PULLING OUT MY PUBIC HAIR.   -  MY TESTICLES ARE MUSHY LIKE MASHED POTATOES, THEY SMELL LIKE BODY ODOR AND HONEY MUSTARD MIXED. AND THEY ARE THE SIZE OF GRAPES.   thats all i feel like confessing to today. yep. im bored, does anyone have any ideas on how i can do somethin constructive with my life? seriously if u could tell me it'd be great.

       it was just the same shit today. i played video game son my computer and i ate a little bit. i did go kayaking in the morning though. thats it. i still cant believe no one has posted comments on my things. i mean i wrote some messed up shit and no one has told me how fucked up i am. oh well, prolly cuz no one wants to sign up for the thing, or no one had read any of this shit yet. heres some secrets about me.   -  I WAIT TILL MY CATS ARE DONE PISSING IN THEIR LITTER BOX AND THEN I GOT AFTER THEM AND EAT THEIR CLUMPS OF PISS LITTER.   -  THE BIG TOE ON MY LEFT FOOD FELL OFF WHEN I WAS 11, THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS PUTTING MY FOOT UP MY ASS TOO OFTEN BUT I JUST WOULDNT LISTEN.   -  SOME TIMES WHEN IM ALONE I DRESS UP LIKE A OLD WOMAN AND FLING MY SHIT AT THE WALL LIKE A MONKEY.   -  IM BORED, ALL OF THE TIME. PLZ I WANT TO DIE, KILL ME.   well thats it for today, i hope some of this enlightened you somehow, or gave u somthin to do so u wouldnt be bored.

       I did what i normally did today, mostly. i played video games on my computer for a couple of hours, and i slept till noon. what was different was that i went and played mini golf today. And i ate at mcdonalds, and i got a hair cut. but thats it. i wish i had somethin to put in these stupid blog entries other than wut ive done for the day, but i cant think of what else to put in. i wish i knew how to add pictures or w/e into this thing but its to complicated, piece of shit. so yeh. i can say what i want because no one will read this anyway, so ill add some more personal secrets.   -  ONCE I DROPPED A FRENCH FRIE IN MY NAVAL, AND WHEN I RETRIEVED IT, IT WAS COVERED IN LINT. SO I FED THE FRENCH FRIE TO MY BROTHER.   -  I HAVE ONE NIPPLE, I GOT HIGH AND BIT THE OTHER TWO OFF. I WAS HIGH ON OLD TOOTHPASTE, I ATE IT ALL.   -  ONE TIME I SMELLED MY ASS IT IT STUNK SO BAD LIKE CAT SHIT THAT I THREW UP AND WENT AND SHIT IN THE CATS LITTER-BOX. AND THEN BECAUSE I WAS SO MAD, I PISSED ON ONE OF THE SLEEPING CATS AND THEN KICKED HIM DOWN SOME STAIRS.   Thats all i can remember for today. Yep. i wish i had a life.

       Today i went to mt. washington. it was pretty boring. we just drove all day and then looked over a mountain for a while and took pictures. yeh. it cost $40 to get in their and to drive up, so my dad fuckin stole some trees. he thought it would justify paying 40$. idk wtf is wrong with him, he like fuckin went out along the road and uprooted like 4 small trees and put them in the back of his truck. i guess he plans to plant them in our yard. yep, thats what happened today. Y am i making these blog entries again? oh yeah cuz i have to much free time and im always bored, thats right. might as well keep doin em, no ones gonna read these anyway so i can put in what i want like i did yesterday. hmmm.   -  I LIKE TO RIP INFANTS HEADS OFF AND HAVE SEX WITH THEIR NECK HOLES.   -  I LIKE TO EAT ALL OF THE PRINGLES FROM A LARGE CAN AND THEN SHIT INSIDE OF IT AND PASS IT AROUND AND TELL THEM ITS WARM BROWNIE FLAVOR, AND THEN I LAUGH AS I WATCH THEM EAT MY SHIT.   -  I HAVE NO PENIS   -  ONE TIME&nbsp;I TOOK A SHIT OUTSIDE AND I HAD NO TOILET PAPER, SO I JUST SHOVED MY THUMB UP MY ASS AND SWABBED THE SHIT OUT OF MY ASS WITH THE THUMB. THEN BECAUSE I HAD NO WATER TO WASH OFF THE THUMB, I JUST ATE THE SHIT OFF OF MY THUMB. THEN I SHOVED WILD BERRIES UP MY ASS TO KEEP THE DEMONS FROM GETTING IN   Well those are my thoughts for today, yes i have nothing better to do &nbsp;

        i guess ive decided to&nbsp;post one&nbsp;of these stupid things every day because im bored. Maybe it'll give me somethin to do so i dont go insane from boredom. i figure i can put anything i want in here because no one will read it anyway so here it goes.     -  I FUCK CATS    -  I LIKE TO RUB PEANUT BUTTER ALL OVER MY DICK AND THEN I PUT MY DICK IN THE MICROWAVE AND FUCK THE MICROWAVE. THEN I TURN THE TOASTER ON AND TOAST THE PEANUT BUTTER ON MY DICK. THEN I SCRAPE THE PEANUT BUTTER OFF MY DICK AND MAKE A SANDWICH WITH IT. I EAT HALF AND GIVE THE OTHER HALF TO THE DOG.    -  I HAVE TO MUCH FREE TIME    -  I PISS ON PEOPLE WHEN THEY SLEEP AND WHEN THEY WAKE UP I TELL THEM I SPILLED WATER.     thats about it. like i said no ones gonna read this anyway so i can say what i want.  maybe i should start saying like what i did for the day in my blog thing. it would be the same every day though, oh well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today i went kayaking and then i played games on my computer.  yep thats it.

        I made this retarded Blog account because you need one to post comments on other people blog account. I had to make fun of Tyler, he was being a big pussy. Let me just quote what he put as one of his postings. &nbsp;  "Today !sucked! I didnt sleep until 8:00Am so I woke up at 2pm and got around 6hours of sleep. Didn't acomplish much (not like i do on summer days anyway).&nbsp;I thought about Tia alot (95% of the time). She's the best, And if anyone trys to hurt her i'll kill them (not really because i'm a wimpy piece of shit :( ). Tia is more than i could have even expected in a girl friend, she's so kind, and so&nbsp;beautiful, funny, and treats me like a real person   ." &nbsp;  Do u c? How could anyone not make fun of that. I made it in pink because its feminine like Tyler. I normally hate these stupid online journals and think theyre a waste of time and are for people with no life, but hey, u just have to do things sometimes if u want to make fun of friends.&nbsp;

       today, idk. it was just another day. identical to all the rest. im beginning to think that by entering the summer ive been sucked into some wormhole where time is frozen and every day repeats itself for eternity. or i just need to get a job or find a hobby or something. yep thats it for today. i really hope no one is reading these boring ass entries i make, because if they r, theyre wasting their time.  im just writin in these to kill my own boredom and to have a log of what ive done over summer. yeh i could have just made one thing and copied it to all other days. im also makin these things to look back at when im 45 and say oh damn those were some good times, bein bored. this is when i work 15 hour days in the acid/turd mines.  if i live to 45 that is.
