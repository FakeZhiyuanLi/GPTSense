      so yeah, as a result of no lan, my night was pretty lame. me and darby rolled out, went to annas. had to pick up a movie. prolly gonna copy it tonight cuz i dont really have time to watch it. ate her ice cream then left. went to best buy for a bit. looked around. after that it was off to the bank. after bank, portillos drive through. could see natalie and others inside doing some sort of odd dance. strange. then to white hen where they had zero sandwiches. i thought that was pretty stupid. so i buy a bag of fritos and these two dumb girls are standing behind me and they go 'can i have your fritos?' and im thinking to myself 'wtf? did they just ask me to give them my fritos?' how do you answer something like that? so i just ignored them and they asked like three more times. anyways, i just acted like i was talking to darby. one of them said something like 'fine ignore us' and im just thinking 'omg you ask a random person to give you what theyve just purchased in a convenience store and you wonder why i dont talk to you?' lame kids. was past their bed time. dont know what they were doing out. anyways, i come home and i find a frog sitting outside my front door. hes about the size of the tip of your finger. so i put him in this little tank thing with some rocks and some lettuce and some water. hes sitting right here on my desk as we speak. i shall call him frogg0r and he shall be mine...or something. anyways, hes pretty cool. just sits on the side of the tank. he just got tired though i think. he fell off and bounced off the lettuce, catipulting him to the other side. hes like 'damn kyle turn your light off so i can go to sleep plzkthx.' so thats prolly what ill do in a sec. gonna be up at like 7 for the zoo. need to make sammiches/clean/etc. guess ill be back around 8ish tomorrow. -shrug- going to bed now i suppose. goodnight.

      yeah, yesterday was pretty hectic. didnt do this then cuz i was too tired. but yeah, got  up real early and was at the train station by 7:45 to head down to chicago. got down there and we realized there was an hour wait for the next train that we needed to catch to head to brookfield zoo. so we walk around union station for an hour and eventually hop on the train. now, the zoo told me we need to get off at the brookfield stop (make sense doesnt it?) but as we hit the stop BEFORE brookfield (hollywood) we realize theres all these signs for the zoo. so were like 'uh oh.' we get off at brookfield and walk around the whack little intersection for a bit and finally head into a store to ask for directions. it turns out that hollywood and brookfield are about a minute apart via train. but to actually walk from the brookfield stop to the hollywood stop takes forever cuz theres no streets. you gotta go all the way around. so this guy ends up drawing us a map to the zoo and we set off walking for what seems like forever. after like an hour we thought we turns the wrong way down one of the streets cuz we didnt find the school we were supposed to see. but then, out of nowhere, appeared school crossing signs so we knew we were close. ended up gettting to the zoo at like noon. 2.5 hrs behind schedule. lol. we got in there and started walking around looking at stuff. went underground to watch the dolphins for a while. i think we looked at them for longer than any other animal. after trying for like 15 mins to get a good picture i finally gave up. everytime  they swam by the glass, some dumb lady got up and kept sticking a mirror on the glass. i have no idea what she was doing. it was really odd though and she kept ruing my pictures :( after that we just started seeing exhibits one by one. we kinda lingered around bears and such for the first part of the day. there was this fragile kingdom thing set up in three sections. there was desert, forest, and then the big cats. it was cool but most of the animals were just sitting there not doin too much. still cool to see though. after that we saw the dolphin show which lasted for a shorter amount of time than we were waiting for it. we sat there for like 30 mins waiting and it was only like 20mins long. lame. -shrug- they did cool stuff though so it was alright. the gorillas and other monkeys in the tropic world were pretty cool. we watched them for a while. habitat africa was enormous. it was three sections that took up the entire northwest part of the zoo. there were like 8billion okapi things. lol. and then giraffes which we cool. we saw the trainer people talk about how they feed them, etc. after that it was something around 4ish id say. we went to sit down and eat lunch for like ten mins and then we raced off to see everything we hadnt seen yet. we stopped by the elephants and such which, in my opinion, were kinda boring. they just stood there for a good while. yeah. then we finally found the reptile house and the swamp which we managed to pass by about fourty times. went in there and i think those animals were the coolest ones. there were all these huge lizards and snakes and such. it was like wheres waldo trying to find all them in their cages cuz they just sat there and blended in. heh. the living coast was fun too. that was the last thing we did. there was this big building devoted to the underwater/costal animals. so there were penguins and seagulls and such just flying/waddling around. there were also these footlong centipeded. blah. gross. but yeah, that pretty much rounded out our day at the zoo. it was like ten to six at this point so we go into a shop and ask someone how to get to the hollywood train station. it turns out, it was like a ten minute walk. how much does that suck huh? so we walk the ten mins it takes to get to the station and sit there for an hour and a half waiting for our train to come to take us back to union station. there were the weirdest people there. well at the zoo too. there was this fifty year old lady whos butt hung out of her shorts. it was thoroughly disgusting. and then the eighty year old in short shorts and a tube top. her boobs dragged the ground. no lie. it was nasty. and there were about 400 amish people there. no lie. it was pretty funny. beard, hats, suspenders, etc. all the kids had the exact same haircut. all the girls wore these little hats. it was weird. we ran into them about five hundred times. the same ones. hehe. then the people at the hollywood station going back. omg. these two girls decide theyre gonna take off their shoes and run around in the middle of the three lane train tracks. i was like 'omg you retards move' and then a train comes and their dad is yelling at them to move their asses. and theyre like 'i dont see a train. where?' little did they realize it was coming behind them. so they move with about five seconds to spare and the train comes flying by at like 80. scared the hell outta me. lol. then we move to the other side of the tracks cuz we realize the train we need to get on comes from the other way. so we do, and theres this annoying guy who decides he has to try out every single ring tone on his phone for everyone to hear. then, out of nowhere, he starts making elephant noises for like ten minutes. thank god, the train came shortly. we got on, rode it back to union station. once there we find out the train back to bartlett doesnt leave til like 8:40. so we have a good hour or better left. we sat around til the train came, got on and had a hell of a time findind seats. we walked to the far end of the train to get some and even then, our car filled up really fast. the train back to btown took like, an hour or so. we pulled in at 9:40. i was home by like ten and dead tired. talk to anna on the phone for a bit and went to sleep. i was exhausted. in a fit of sleepyness i set my alarm for 8 thinking id have to be at work today by 9:30. i misjudged. i really have to be there at 11:30. so ive had three hours to just sit around doing nothing. gotta work til 5 something today and then im prolly gonna do something with anna afterwards. its 11:05 now. gotta roll soon. guess im done here.
