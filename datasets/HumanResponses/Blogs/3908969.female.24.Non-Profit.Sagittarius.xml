       urlLink    Tourists of "Jamie's World," I would like you to meet Grace Ann. She is the daughter of my brother, Alan, and sister-in-law, Lacy, and grandaughter to the proud grandparents Dennis and Julia. Gracie-Lou (as she is affectionately referred to) was born January 16th 2004 and is the newest edition to the McClendon clan. She will celebrate a big mile-stone tomorrow, July, 16th: her 6-month BIRTHDAY! So, pucker-up and don't mind the slobber, she's teething. &nbsp; urlLink

      Seeing as the election year is getting heated with all of the anti-bash Bush propaganda (e.g. Fahrenheit 9/11), and now the merger of two very wishy-washy liberals running for President and V.P., I feel compelled to post this article that I found.   Now, remember (and this is reiterated at the bottom of the article), you canNOT believe everything you read on-line, see on T.V., and hear on the radio...if you want to be a voter that has a clue about what is going on come this November's election I suggest you do your own research.     JEFF'S THOUGHTS ON MICHAEL MOORE AND FAHRENHEIT 9/11   including links to the anti-Moore web sites        It's unfortunate, but many people will use Farenheit 9/11 as their election education, and do no further reading or research.  They will watch this film, pass judgement on Bush, the war in Iraq, and the war on terrorism.  They will decide who they are going to vote for based on two hours or so in a movie theater.  This scares me ...    ... It scares me because it's not fair to anyone.  If you are basing all you know on a particular subject from one movie, one radio show, one news program, or one newspaper article ... then you don't know enough!    Personally, I give Michael Moore credit for creating a work that everyone is talking about, however I have to stop there.  He created a piece of fiction and labeled it a documentary and put it out there for mass consumtion.  Idiotic and dangerous.  I hope someday he is ashamed, but somehow I doubt his ego will ever allow that.    The above paragraph is my opinion.  I base that opinion on lots of reading and research.  However, I have not yet seen the film.  I will see it in the near future so I can more properly challenge it.  Please know that my thoughts or opinions may change after seeing the film and gaining more knowledge, and if that occurs, I will share with you on the air and here.      In the meantime, educate yourself -- regardless of your opinion of Michael Moore.  Here are some links I have found useful:   The official movie site:  http://www.fahrenheit911.com/    Michael Moore's official site:  http://www.michaelmoore.com/   A USA Today article about the movie.  If you are short on time, just scroll down and read the notes in the box on the left-hand side:   http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-06-24-fahrenheit-cover_x.htm   The lies of Michael Moore:  http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723/   Exactly what it says:  http://www.moorelies.com/   A watchdog site that uncovers lies and exagerations distribued by Michael Moore:  http://www.moorewatch.com/   The mis-truths of Michael Moore's other recent movie:  http://www.bowlingfortruth.com/     Please remember, don't automatically believe everything you read on these web pages, watch on TV, or hear on the radio.  Take time to learn about the news and issues on your own.  READ!  LEARN!  Make your own decisions and don't follow the herd ... question, challenge, and don't stop until you are comfortable with the knowledge you have gained.

      Just a lowly twenty-something doing something new. I am a student at a university in GA and work at a hospital in Atlanta. It's fun, so far. We'll see next year.

       It's been a while, I know, but circumstances surrounding my absence demanded too much of my time. I have now carved out some of that precious time to sit down in cyberspace and give some of my valuable and easily distracted attention to much more important issues, me. Naw, I'm only kidding, but while we're on the subject. I would like to share some pictures with you from two summers ago. That is the summer of 2003 for those whose math is a little rusty. I had the amazing privilege to travel with some very special people around eastern Africa. More specifically, in Chimoio, Mozambique and Harare, Zimbabwe. Our mission: To show comfort and love to others from the comfort and love we ourselves have recieved from Christ. (2 Corinthians 1:3&4)      Coming soon...more pictures !
