      Recently, there has been a tragic terrorist attack in Madrid, Spain.  The standing populist political party had pointed the finger at a Spanish separatist group, but understandably, Al Quida has surfaced as a probable suspect (and rightly so).  Spain was our strongest western European ally, and one of our strangest allies globally, as well as the attack happened 911 days from 9-11-2001.  In the subsequent election, the trailing socialist party, who favored a withdrawal of troops from Iraq won the election for prime minister in an upset days after.    The Thought    Al Quida and all terrorist groups know as well as you and I, that they can not achieve the aspirations militarily.  In a global head to head match up with clear lines drawn, they would lose hands down.  So, if their objective is not to bring us to our knees militarily, than what is their objective?  All of you with your thinking caps on, have, or will come to conclusion that the goal is to bring us to our knees politically and socially.  That's right, the desire of the terrorists is to influence the view of the general population that the war on terror, our support of Israel, our global influence of liberty, and our presence in the middle east (i.e. Saudi Arabia), is not worth the cost, and will elect politicians with these same views.  If this is the case, the terrorists have won, the have achieved their goal.    Conclusion    The recent events in Spain has shown terrorists (whether or not is was Al Quida) the goal is attainable, and it is a gray day in the battle between good and evil.  Spain has raised the white flag of surrender.  I hope that we do not send the same message in our up coming elections.     Editorial thoughts   1) If there was no link between Iraq and Al Quida (as has been asserted by some), why would Spain be attacked by them?   2) If the military operation in Iraq was unilateral (as has been asserted by some), how could we lose an ally?

      In the second of my PEETH post I have decided to keep it short and just tell people that just because we live in a country, The U.S., that has free trade and a free market system does not mean mean in any way that you should expect to get things for Free.  Free, or $0.00, is something that we only get when a product is useless, keep this in mind next time you get something for $0.00.    Keep checking in for more PEETH posts.

      This is the first of many posts to come about the unethical behavior of our countries businesses and people who patronize them.  The title above is an organization that I am founding to deter people from being jerks to eachother, and making stupid comments.  Soon to come will be a rant about the ethical practices of The UPS Store, and then a rant about the people who purchase music as well as those who don't.  I hope this will become a long standing organization that will create a more economically ethical society.

      Are we seeing the end of Major Labels?  Short answer, NO  In my daily readings of a few websites I found  urlLink this post .  Read it its good.  This is really well thought out, but some of the ideas just don't work.  I can't get on board with anyone that says we don't need big business.  In the post above, dude suggests that we are seeing the decline of Major Record Labels and at that we don't need them.  Not only that, but he has people commenting that support him.  The fact is that major labels front the money to produce and album, and that can be a hell of a lot of money.  We are not seeing the decline of any large business and the reason is...  We need them.  For some reason, money produces results.  I know that may not be the popular opinion right now, but its true.  Without money, the support of large businesses, and the persitance of bands, there would be little music.  Even little "indie" labels are now owned by big business.  Epitaph records is owned by Warner Brothers.  But, lets get beyond that since Epitaph is well know and plays label to a lot of bands, Hellcat records is owned by Epitaph, which in turn means it is owned by Warner Brothers.  Even Drive Thru Records, the epidimy of small "indie" label about four years ago has sold out.    This all amounts to a pile of beans, records are expensice.  And the convenience of buying them is even more expensive.  Years ago you couldn't go to twenty local stores and purchase almost any album you wanted to, you had to go to a Record Shop and purchase it from them.  Now, I can go to 7-11 and get an album if I want.  So, we pay for the price of convenience.  Money needs to be made.  I wanted to find the price of a record in the 70s, or even earlier if possible, so that I could compare it with what the price is now.  I was unsuccessful in this and would ask that if you know where I can find this information, or have first hand information, that you would let me know.  Now, one of the things I do agree with in that post, although I don't know if he made any argument about it, is that artists make far too little when their music is sold in stores.  Obviously they should make less than if they sell it themselves at a show, but they should have to take 400% less because of it.  I don't know how this issue can be resolved, but it is an issue and bands are getting screwed because of it.

      Today starts two weekes of hell.  Starting today we, my bosses and I, will be moving their residence and the office.  This entails packing everything from two 1000 square foot apartments and taking them down two flights of stairs to one of four garages.  Then on July 8th, the moving company will come and pick up all of the boxes and furniture that is down there to move to the new office/residence.  Following the moving of the office and that residence, I will be moving as well.    Right now I am tired and want to sleep, but I cannot as I am at work getting ready to move a boat load of boxes.  Maybe I will be around later.

      Why are the people that I work for so fucking retarded?  It has much to due with the fact that neither of them believes that he/she should have to do anything beyond exactly what they want to do.  If I were anywhere else, I would have told them to go shove a sharp stick in their eye today.  Why do I have to stay late when I was on time?  Did I somehow make you four hours late, did I somehow make promises to clients in your voice?  I don't think that I did, but I might be mistaken.  I really want a new job, one free of moody, stupid, rich people that can't decide on anything.

      Ten days ago I put in a resume for a job that I really want.  Something that I think would be perfect for me.  The problem is that a little over a month ago I put in an resume for the same job in a different city and was rejected within a couple of hours.  So maybe that is good news.  Maybe they are really looking into hiring me this time and are unable to look away from my resume.    The problem then becomes that I am looking at a job in Phoenix with another company, that I think I am a shoe in for.  I would take it the minute it is offered to me, but I really want the job previously mentioned.  Why do they have to come in groups?  Why couldn't I just have gotten in with one company and gotten a job, rather than having to sit around considering two.    The good news is that either way I will be leaving my current position and moving on to better things that will make me a much happier person.  The bad news is that neither of the new jobs will be in Denver, which means I will have to move away from everyone I know.  Super lame.

      It has been a crazy three or four days since Reagan died.  Friday night, the day before his death, a crazed lunitic in Granby decided that he hated people so much that he would destroy their property.  Saturday morning Reagan died and ever since, he has been under constant surveilance from everyone in the United States.  I understand that he was an important man and that he deserves to be remembered, but does putting him on display do anything for this?  Couldn't we all just say a little prayer for him, or just think about him for a few moments without going to look at his cold dead lifeless body.  On the plus side, Sunday a guy that works for Taco Bell was asaulted with a Gordita, apparently he refused to fix a man's order and said man shoved a meat and cheese filled flat bread in his face.

       urlLink The Factor  is being broadcast from the DNC this week and tonight has got to be the highlight of the year on the show.   urlLink Mr. Michael Moore  will be on the show tonight and in typical O'Reilly form, I have seen many clips of yelling.  I am going to give a few highlights of the conversation as it happens.      The beginning of the show was a little different with very few talking points and getting right to an interview/conversation with Ben Affleck.  It was quite surprising that O'Reilly continually complimented Affleck and made light of some comments that were made by the actor.   While the two of them might disagree fundamentally, there were no personal attacks made in either direction.    Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly discussion, I really hope that transcripts become available from this program.    Both men were a little illogical in their questioning.  However, Moore kept pursuing his question, "Would you sacrifice your child to overthrow a brutal dictator?"  The problem with this question is that he really as no opinion to offer in this matter.  No one is allowed to sign their child up for the military, no parent can in state the draft.   O'Reilly's answer was that he would be willing to go himself, but had no intention of commiting his children to military service.  This is the same thing that Moore pursued in his movie Farenheit 9/11.  I made the same comment after the movie that I will make now, and that is that no one can commit another person to the military.  I know that the draft is the exception, but I am seriously doubtful that a draft will happen now or ever again.    O'Reilly persisted on the point, "If you were in power, Sadam would still be in power."  As in the last question I wrote about, this is basically a moot point.  Moore would never have been elected, no chance.  Moore wouldn't be the worst president ever.   Think about how often normal presidents are critisized by the media.  Now think about what would happen if a critic was in office.    So out of about 8 questions that were asked, the two I have presented are completely circumstantial.  Good show, I highly recomend that you watch it tonight at 9 pm Mountain time if you have the chance.

       urlLink    The comment was made that it didn't appear that I had a hall.  So, here is a picture from the living room of the hall.  The bathroom is on the right just past the stove.&nbsp; urlLink

      I told many people that I would put pictures of my apartment up as soon as I had a camera.  So, here they are.  You will most likely notice quickly that there is only one door.  It is not really big, but for one person it is pretty good.  It is about as much space as I need.  Feel free to comment if you feel the need.

      It took me a little while to get an internet connection at my new residence, but I found a great connection for a not so high price.  For the low, low price of just 24.99 each month I am able to connect at a fairly fast speed and I don't need a phone line or a cable line to do so.  So far I am impressed, but I will keep you all updated as to how it goes.  Hopefully this will work out and I won't have to figure out another service.

      Soccer becomes a far more interesting sport when you drink and there is the anticipation of fireworks.  Today was a quite uneventful day other than stopping by work to get a couple of things done quickly so that the next day of hell weeks will run smoother.  Near the end of the day a friend invited me to go to the Rapid's game, mostly to watch the fireworks afterward.  Over the past few weeks I have become a little more interested in soccer because of some of the insane rules and how they work.  So, I agreed to go.  I found quickly that the game is not that interesting, but that if you consume much alcohol it becomes interesting.  After the game tonight they shot off fireworks for a little of thirty minutes.  Following the game we spent almost 1.5 hours trying to exit the parking lot.  When we finally did, the police officers cut off the closest exit explaining that the exit was closed, "BECAUSE."  Had we known their great reasoning we would not have asked.  Fighting traffic on both Federal and I-25 was bad, but not as bad as was expected from the inside of the parking lot.  Independence Day will never be as good as it was today.

      Was controversy between Moore and Disney created by Mr. Moore rather than Mr. Eisner and his clan.  According to records held by Disney, the greatest loss in the history of the company was EuroDisney.  At one point this multibillion company had to be bailed out of a large mess in Europe.  Who was the most major investor in this blunder?  If you guessed The Carlyle Group, heavily funded by the Bin Laden Family, then you were correct.    It is my suggestion that Moore may have started the controversy to get away from Disney so that connections were not made to him.  He made the same connections between the Bush family and the Bin Laden Family in his new film.

       urlLink    The last band of the night was Bear Vs. Larger Bear.  This was the last show that they would be playing in their current incarnation.  The drummer is moving to CA for grad school, and as I hear it, the lead singer is moving to Phoenix to get involved with a better scene.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is Natson Jones, a completely different sound all together.  I have never heard anything quite like them.  2 Cellos, a 4/4 upright bass, and a drummer.  The only thing that even comes close is Uphollow, but they are more regular music with a cello.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is a picture of a band called Bee Eaters from South Dakota. They were pretty good, they could have had a bit better stage activity, but the music was pretty good. They guy on the left had some really cool guitar work. The bass player was boring, in presence and music.  urlLink

      I just want to give you some of my thoughts on America based on the news that I have seen today.  I think that John Kerry and George Bush should fight to the near-death for the presidency.  Why do all our communicating with talking when we could just kick the living shit out of eachother, or shoot eachother.  Just to clarify, that was not a knock on either candidate.  It is a knock on the rest of our society right now.   As for child rapists being let out of jail and then petitioning the state to let her go after the kid again, I don't understand what the problem is now if he wants to see her.  He is 21 and therefore of legal age.  Now, is she wants to go starting fucking other little kids, that is a problem.  I just wonder what she was thinking when she did this.  She has two kids with this ... kid, but who was going to support her and her four kids, two from a prior relationship.  For christ sakes he was only 12 when they had their first kid.   Colin Powell is pretty inteligent and does not get worked up easily.  Brit Hume is quite distinguished.  Hacking is an appropriate last name for that man.  It is just too bad that his wife's last name wasn't 'hacked.'  Scott Peterson loves the porn.  Kobe Bryant is a womanizer, maybe he will be our generation's Wilt Chamberline.
