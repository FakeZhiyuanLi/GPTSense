      So my friends and I were almost assaulted after the Pride Parade this past Sunday.  I was ready to make a headlong dash at the offender but my two girl soldiers told me to walk away.  It was hard.  I realized I did not have my leather-strap-with-MasterLock on me.  I later realized that that leather-strap-with-MasterLock was a sorry weapon against an aggressive and focused male.    The incident shook me up for the rest of the day.  I tried to run it off down in Battery Park to no avail.  But I found this:  A lonely figure runs to the end looks left and right for which way to go catches a glimpse of quiet air and knows peace lies there.  Walks to the this pond just steps from the ocean held inside a little space created for the lonely figure.  There is a pond and bubbles from fish and six groups of tall grass that are fixed in the water. Wind blows on them softly or wildly And they are still there.  There is a poem written on the side. I sat by the poem The pond held me And I let out my heart to it I stayed until it was time to go I was yet melancholy  But I have the memory of a friend in loneliness.

      So in what appears to be my 10-year side career doing administrative crap in offices where luckily I always have internet access, I find myself xeroxing chapters out of this book - "The Handbook of the Right-Wing Conspiracy - How to Defeat the Arguments of the Loony Left" by Mark W. Smith.  There is a little endorsement in the corner by Ann Coulter, something to the effect of:  "Mr. Smith is a rising star!"    Now I am certainly not political.  Anyone who knows me knows I know jack-crap about politics, I never vote, and I don't even listen to NPR.  All I care about is pot, sex, and dinner.  And if I get any responses to this blog suggesting I have sex with so-and-so, then go stick a rifle up your ass and fire.  Preferably fire forward so your balls get blown off.    But I do know that Ann Coulter is hailed by Al Franken as an absolute lunatic.  And I'll tell you one thing about conservative pundits - everytime I hear them talk I hear the voice of a person with a shriveled heart, a fat wallet, cold dry skin, and silver spoon in a back pocket.    So with well-practiced masochism, I'm reading this lovely-looking tome, catching phrases to to the effect of:  "Liberals think the government should tax more and that it spends the money in the best way, so let's have high taxes for liberals and low taxes for conservatives!"  or "Reagan really saved the economy, not Clinton."  Then the lawyer who requested this intellectually stimulating job is suddenly peering over my shoulder, pointing out black smudges on the xerox, evidence that I have not pressed the spine of the venerable volume hard enough onto the copier.    Who gives a crap? I think to myself.  But maybe this lawyer with tight lips, tight nostrils, and probably a much tighter asshole is really a cool dude who is copying this for his night college law class to make fun of it.  So I ask, "So, what are these copies for?"  "Oh," he answers, "They want to give me an award at this economics conference and they want a few chapters of my book to hand out."  Then I realize I am talking to THE Mark W. Smith, the author of this book, probably a hero in some circuits.  Out of sheer fun...  Wait, gotta fun this later - I'm being called upon by a PARTNER in the firm
