      Somehow I thought about those days where I was at happiest. Where I'd feel so light-hearted and kinda full of myself.   ...  Those were the days I shared with my running companions back in jc. I thought about our training sessions. How I started out...  The arms that swung like monkeys (which I think I still do today)... Feet that landed on the heels instead of the balls of my feet... A weird upright posture while running (esp on the bends of the track)... etc...  I thought of how I started, totally an amateur that even my coach tried to discourage me from joining the team given my totally non-existent running background. The start of those training days gave me very bad blisters and running along with L.Ang, and sometimes Sth made it all rather bleak since I didn't know what to expect when the extire team joined us after the track and field meet. That was the JC1 days.   Running with my mates made training all the more gentler to bear. No matter how tired, demoralised and weary we were, we'd grit our teeth and still try to give the best that we can. It's this fighting spirit that I miss.  When I think back now. I'm must say I'm rather astonished that I had gone through training as tough as that. I'd always remember this fighting spirit and courage that I once displayed ever so often during the training sessions. Running competitively, training as a team and leading a troope of girls taught me many invaluable lessons that I'd hold dear to me fo the rest of my life.  These are truely   HAPPY THOUGHTS   !!!

      It also dawned upon me.. That Kel was probably my best friend of all times, till we fell out in jc, over yet again another petty argument that never cleared up. I  HATE  petty arguments!  ARGH !!!!!   Kel's probably the one friend that I've ever had, to share happy moments, sad times, talk about anxieties etc. Simply put, talk rubbish. I recently came across this letter she gave me while we were studying for the big Os and she too wrote that it's just so wonderfully nice to have someone there. Someone who is always around, there,  when you suddenly thought of something and wanted to share with someone. A simple turn of the head lets your eyes meet your  confidente . That was pure bliss.. My closest ever  confidente  in NTU would prob be sn though I can't say the same for her since she has so many good friends.  I kept telling jw yesterday that I didn't have any friends at all. That was so sad. And a heart wrenching thought. I had left my house all happy and enthusiastic to meet my friends for our final photo taking session in NTU only to feel sad while in campus, and totally devastated on my way home. Again, I was so overwhelmed by these horrid thoughts that i just had to release everything. As L.Ang put it, crying is a highly effective method to release streee. When I confined in my mum later, I realised that sn was just feeling caught in the heat of all that was happening and was not to be blamed. The rest, probably I don't know them well enough to qualify them as close friends. As for sr, she doesn't know me well enough to be a close friend.   My one thought about close friends, which was the same as what Kel once expressed, that they are the ones who can talk about anything under the sun, absolutely anything and not take offence at any thought that flashes cos you just know the other party so well that you know it's not in that person's nature to say anything offending. You're just so comfy in each other company that restrictions are unheard of. I miss having that.   I thought about my years in NTU, in jc, in sec school.. and realised how much I've changed over the years. From being simple, gracious if you may call it, I've become street-wise and hard. I've had enough of letting people have their way and bottling all inside of me, just singing the blues away. I've kind of developed a way to protest at all those unhappy things that happen to me. And I've become a loner in that process.   My memories are all that I have now. Happy ones. As for the friends bit. It has become transient. I'm just contented to receive letters from mlg, icq hoggie and apple, hang out with my bf, jw and hopefully maintain a long-standing friendship with sn.

      I've notice one thing in me... That I tend to express my innermost thoughts only when I'm at my lowest points. Most of te pieces of 'journels' that I've written are mostly during the times when I'm troubled.  I never thought that I'd be posting something here so soon. Till yesterday when I was back in campus. I had this very strong urge to pen down how lousy I felt.   I felt caught. Between jw whom I knew was feeling rather left out of the all-girl troupe and my want to mix with the other girls cept for 'sr'. My frustrations, at having to deal with another petty argument could no longer be withheld as large droplets of tears trickled down the blazing hot sun and I just had to get away from them all.   My only thought then was that I didn't exactly have friends.   Many a time, I've pondered on the word ' Friends '. As Webster puts it-  One attached to another by affection or esteem  . There is however a strong linkage between 'friends' and 'acquaintance' which Webster defines as a person whom one knows but who is not a particularly close friend. Many people make the mistake of assuming that they're basking in the light of friendship while in reality, they are mere acquaintances with these so-call friends.   I thought about the 'friends' that I've made through my years, since the start of school at a tender age, till university. And realised that the younger I was, the less complicated 'friends' were and most of genuinely friends. Alas, time drove a wedge with these friends of mine as we drifted apart with the attendance of different schools. At present moment, I can only call few 'friends' now.
