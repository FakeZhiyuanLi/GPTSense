Or a product that once we bought it, it turned out to be defective or incapable of the purpose it was bought for.  Yet every year, after year our defense department and individual units do it. The Department of Defense pays contractors up front for the promise of newly developing equipment that is almost always late and at a higher cost that was originally given. Every year in the last months before a new fiscal year units spend all the money left within their budgets to make sure that they get the same amount again.  Whether they need the money or not. A perfect example of an over budget project is the new fighter plane, the F-22 Raptor. By December 2000 the aircraft was planned to have had 2,000 test hours flown so that the Air Force could make a decision on ordering more of the planes, yet by that time only 2 hours of test flying had been done. By August 2002 there is planned to have 3,757 test flight hours logged. So far only 831 hours have been flown. Currently $63 billion dollars have been committed to this project.  Can you even imagine this figure, $63,000,000,000? Personally I don’t spend $63 without thinking twice about it. That sum of money for a plane that has yet to be even properly tested, proven, or purchased. The Raptor is not alone in its’ price tag. The B-2 bomber has gone from costing $550 million to $2.2 billion. That is for each and every plane.  Those are but two of the many classic examples of military spending gone wrong. Back in the 1980’s it was big news when it was learned what the military was paying for everyday items such as hammers, toilet seats, nuts and washers. To this day the $250.00 airplane toilet sear is still a joke. At the time when the stories broke the officials and contractors tried to make a stand and justify the price tags as shipping and handling costs. No one was fooled. Contractors play a very large part in the price of the goods, as do politicians and the senior ranking generals within the ranks.  For the contractors it is a matter of keeping the money flowing to their companies, no matter the means by which this is accomplished. Usually it means promising to build a factory or to spend large sums of money in a politician’s district. Or the promise of a high level position to the military representative on retirement from his or her post. For them it means out bidding each other, even if it means bidding to low and on a timeline promise that is impossible. They know that they can appeal for more money and time later in Congress, and the politicians that work for them will vote in the companies’ favor. These companies push for the government to purchase things it does not need so as to keep the CEO’s well paid and the company trudging along the road of corruption.  The politicians continue to vote approvingly of the spending because it will mean jobs for their constituents. For many areas the company may be the biggest employer and that most big dollar projects are worked from several different areas, causing more than one district to be affected if the flow of money is cut off. The biggest part of the argument, jobs lost as the affect of military cuts. This is not the case. Most of the layoffs occur from divisions of the company not related to defense contracting. There is no incentive for companies to improve the nonmilitary products. Those items are subject to the flow of the market and consumer need, while the money from the DOD is an ever-flowing river of cash without end it seems. Moreover it has been shown that for every billion dollars spent on arms creates 25,000 jobs. If that same money had been spent in a way to enhance the populations well being such as health care it could create 47,000 jobs. If it had been spent in education it could create 41,000 jobs.  Those are just jobs created from the government spending the tax money on improving itself. If it were to give the money back to the tax payer to spend on goods and services more jobs would be created and the economy would be in better shape. Instead of large sums of money being spent on a few items that no one but the military will benefit from, there will be all that money placed back into the hands of those who earned it to spend it on things to improve their own lives and conditions. When people are paying fewer taxes, and they would be if there was not so much excessive spending in the DOD, they spend more money, keeping the dollar circulating. It takes about $50,000 of money spent to create the need for a new job position in the civilian sector, while the government spends over $70,000, most of which is used up in the paperwork involved in the process.  The generals all have a large stake in the contracting business. When it comes time for them to retire from service they want to sit on a board or to be the CEO of on of the companies they pushed contracts through for. They want to keep the contractors happy and are more than willing to ensure that their friends are treated well.  They are  taken care of, free of charge, at least to them, the tax payers pick up the tab.  Rides on military planes, ships, and free luxury hotel rooms are very common practice for generals and their contractor and political friends. All for the sake of keeping the dollars flowing to a select few and all involved are happy and well taken care of. You would think that people that dedicate their lives to the service of the United States would put the welfare of the people and government above their own desires for luxury and wealth. It does not make any sense. For 2000 it is estimated that about $546.6 billion was spent directly and indirectly on the DOD. That is 41.3% of the total estimated budget of $1.3 trillion in the entire budget. The only other administration that receives more of the budget is health care. Interest on the national debt is in third place at 20%. With the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department come out lastly with less than 1% each of the budget.  The United States is the biggest spender when it comes down to military spending. Worldwide it takes a 37% bite out of the combined total military spending. Sixteen times larger than the combined totals of Cuba, Iran, Syria, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya. With that information, how can such a large budget be justified? The DOD says it needs to keep developing better weapons to stay ahead of all our current and potential enemies. But if they are not spending their own money on such research what weapons do we need to stay ahead of? The second point if we need to be so far ahead in technology, way have we been using the same aircraft and rifles for the nearly 40 years? If they aren’t broke and can accomplish the goals, why replace them? For instance the F-15 has been called the best plane in the world, and is still far ahead of anything other countries, countries that do develop technology, have been able to create. So, why do we need the Raptor?  Instead of spending billions of dollars on new and not always better systems, why not just replace equipment that is worn out with new equipment of the same type? The best comparison is that you trade in your reliable low maintenance car for a sports car that is in the shop three weeks of every month. Why spend the money on something not being used?  What should and desperately needs to be employed is an agency outside personal agenda direct benefit of the contracting system. Contractors need to be accountable for the price gouging and the failure to fulfill contracts as promised. There are plenty of watch dog groups out there that keep an eye on the government spending, either specifically as the military or for a wide number of agencies. Such as Taxpayers for Common Sense (taxpayer.net), Taxpayers against Fraud (tax.org), Pork Buster Patrol (porkbuster.org). Yet they do not have the funding that the contractors do. There is no way to match it, and if you think about it, the contractors get the money to pad the way for more funding from the funding they received to begin with, a giant loop of ever increasing price tags that consumes without contributing.  The U.S. military is a big machine that has been abused in recent years as the solver of the worlds’ problems. This is against our own constitution, which states the military is for the national defense. When was the last time the borders of this country were threatened? The lives of our sons and daughters should not be used to defend oil-producing countries or in stopping conflicts that have been raging for centuries between conflicting religions. The current military is too big for the world. If the leadership would keep the DOD out of the rest of the world there could be great reduction in spending that would allow money to be spent elsewhere in promoting the growth of the nations well being. If needed, the machine can be turned back on as it has been in past conflicts. There has to come a time when the leadership realizes that the Cold War is over and that it is time to turn the focus in on addressing internal concerns.

Growing up in central Florida with plenty of lakes nearby, for a kid like me it was great.  Cannon was my favorite and to this day, I have some of the best memories of my life from there.  	 	 	    Canon had a small beach area that was a rectangular fenced in piece of sand that came away from the water only about fifteen feet.  At the edge of the fence the grass was always trying to reclaim this piece of land that my young life revolved around.  A single rusted metal-framed lifeguard stand stood centered above the sand.  When the water was high, waves would lap up to the concrete slab that was the base of the stand and wash away the sand, making the thing tilt over.  Behind and to right side of the beach was a large grassy area with tall pine trees that kept the ground covered in dried pine needles and shade.  I’d get dizzy looking up into the treetops.  Sometimes us kids braid a few of the pine needles into little whips and try to make the others cry and give up.  Sometimes, like it does when kids play rough, one of us would get mad and then there were be a tantrum thrown blindly behind tears.     		There were covered concrete benches with bar-b-que grills.  Standard Park grills, metal box on a pole with a greasy grate on top that has never been scrubbed clean of cooked meats.  Nearby would always be the leaky faucet sticking lopsided out of the ground.  Water always spayed out wildly from it in all directions.  Loved getting the water to pour on the coals after the cooking was done, see the red glow under the ash, hear the sizzle and see steam rising up.  Farther over was a canal that ran into the lake, drainage from the surrounding area.   At the edge of the park was a small parking lot, a boat ramp, and another small pier, beyond that was all overgrown weeds, banana trees and come cane.   		When we’d go down to the lake as a group of family and friends all us kids would go to the end of the pier, run the last few feet and jump off into the water, go to the bottom, feel around in the dark water for snail shells.  We’d find some that were as big as our fists.  At the bottom, it was just a thin layer of loose sand and the rest was hard pack.  Though the water there was only deep enough to make my ears pop slightly it still had pockets of cold water to chill your skin to goose bumps, even on hot days.  On the way up, I’d open my eyes and see the sun sparkling through the green tint of the lakes water.  I could hear the droning of ski boats farther out, like a beehive under water.  They’d run parallel to the shore towing a skier who would sometimes end the ride into the tall grasses of the other side of the pier.  We’d paddle out deeper until just our heads were bobbing and wait on the wake from the boats to push us toward shore.  Once in awhile there would be a giant horsefly buzzing just over the waters surface looking for a forehead to land on and take a big bite.  A quick slap would take care of that pest.     		The pier was also a place to scare us.  When the water was low enough, the underside of the pier was exposed near the shore we would go under water, and come up underneath it face first, eyes open.  It would be nothing but slime, snails, and big black water bugs crawling around. Our imaginations did the rest.  It wouldn’t take long before the slime covered dripping bottom got to be too much and we went back to playing, a little farther away from the pier.   		As much as we loved the lake, the canal was a great place too.  The canal started far from the lake; occasionally we would have an expedition to find the place where it began but we would get tired or distracted and never go all the way.  It was probably about twelve feet deep and a road width across; of courses it was never full of water, mostly just a couple feet deep or less.  We could see small fish swimming through the grass along the sides.  When it rained is when we had the best time, the water would rise and move fast down to the lake.  We would get pieces of plywood, boards, and even old dry rotted shipping pallets and ride the current down a length of the canal.  Usually stopping at a tunnel that ran under where the roads intersected.  We weren’t brave enough for that.  In addition, we never ever went into the last short part of pipe that emptied into the lake.  Here the mouth of the canal widened and was shallow enough to walk around just ankle deep at times. Other places the volume of water flowing out to the lake cut beep trenches in the sand.  We’d walk around on the ever-changing sand bars catching tadpoles or just exploring.  When it was deeper, you could see bass jumping violently out of the water in pursuit of shiners and minnow.   Where the pipe emptied from under the last street the concrete slab at the bottom of the pipe was eroded under to form a cavern.  In that little cave, under the water was the meanest animal of the lake. We knew he was there and never wanted to test and see if he wasn’t, at least not with body parts, but sometimes a stick or fishing pole to probe around.  He was big, gnarly and always pissed off.  To my childhood memory, he had to be about the size of a car tire.  His shell was looking gnarly and prehistoric looking.  Closest we would come to the thing was on sandbars that would form, erode, and reform within the canal.  However, it was always deep right were the water poured in from the pipe.  That gator turtle lived there.  A few times, we hooked him on fishing lines trying to catch small fish to use as bass bait, and were rewarded to a fight like reeling in a marlin.  His head would pop up from below and hiss at us in pure hatred.  That caused a lot of excitement for us, and fear.  That thing was mean.  Of course the line would always snap and we got to watch our bobbers move around on the surface and then sink.  I imagine it had a lot of hooks stuck in that jaw.   	I never thought much for bass fishing with the endless casting out and reeling back in.  I wanted to have a cork set for about three feet deep and a real piece of bait on the hook.  My summers were of nothing but waking up, dressing and heading out the door to a friend’s house to see if he wanted to go to the lake.  The summer when I was about twelve it was always with another kid named Roger.  He was the same age as me but about a foot taller plus about seventy-five pounds, and platinum blonde hair that was kind of swirled in the front.  I always thought he looked like a really white version of the Shoneys big boy.  He was always up for going and I don’t think we missed a day of fishing that summer.      		This was back in the some years when there were still frogs in all the ditches, shorelines and swampy areas.  During a good rain at night there would be nothing but the sound of thousands of frogs calling to each other in the dark.  Walk outside and you’d see them hopping all over the road.  The next morning there would be nothing but flat carcasses of frogs that never made it back into the ditches.  After a couple days of summer sun beating down on the remains they became flat dried frog.  Made great weapons for a couple young boys to throw at each other, just gross enough for us to really enjoy.  Sometimes my younger brother Glen came along.  He made a great target for honing the skills for frog flinging.     		When we went to the water it was with poles in hand and all our tackle in a red flyer wagon.  A tackle box each and an old butter bowl with holes cut into the top by a pocketknife and fresh dirt and worms inside freshly dug from Rogers’ yard.  The poles were ready to go as soon as we got to the water.  The little round bobber, half-white, and the other half red was set on the line at the top of the pole with a nice long thin hook meant for holding a worm.  Our tackle boxes next to each other in middle of the wagon, the worms at the very back.  Once we got to the lake we didn’t stop at the edge, we went right into the water, clothes and all.  We had a great starting spot.  Lots of tall grass sticking through the surface that we just knew hid millions of hungry fish.  Catfish preferably.  The wagon came right along with us.  Once in the water we baited up and cast the lines away from us.  While we waited on the first catch we would tie the stringer, for hooking the fish through the gills and mouth until cleaning time, to one of the wheels.  The wagon leaked or was getting hit from waves created by the wake of boats.   		My most memorable day was while we were involved in our routine.  Roger hauled in a good-sized catfish and needed help getting off the hook and onto the stringer. I set my reel into the wagon and let the rod itself dangle into the water.  Just as we got done with his fish we both see my bobber making its way across the water under its own power.  Followed by my rod pulled all the way into the water and the reels metal sinking it to the bottom immediately.  The only way to find the rod was that the bobber was still pulling across the surface; it still had slack in the line.  If we didn’t get it before the fish pulled the line tight and the bobber disappeared, no more pole, we’d never find it.  I was in a little more than waist deep and trying to do the water run that is all splashing and very little movement.  Roger was a little smarter and used his rod to snag my line pulling it into reach.  Between the both of us we got the rod back up, drained the water from the gear housing and started reeling in the fish at the other end.  It wasn’t a monster catfish but it had us excited over the way we caught it, two fish at the same time.  That was one of my best summers.   		Now most of the fish are gone, so are the frogs, canal has been covered over and I’m sure there is nothing left of the gator turtle but a hollow shell in the sand.  The beach is overgrown with warning signs of “DANGER: NO SWIMMING” posted on the fence.  A place that meant, means so much to me and so many other kids now adults has been reduced to just another polluted area no one can enjoy.  Part of growing up is saying goodbye to childhood.  I’ve just never been good at saying those.
