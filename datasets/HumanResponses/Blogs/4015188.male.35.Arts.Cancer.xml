         We all have to start somewhere.   &nbsp; And of course, we also know where ultimately we are headed...well in a gerneral sense anyway.&nbsp; I have done my best to avoid this whole blog thing.&nbsp; The problem I have with it is that most people are boring, stupid, or both.&nbsp; I know that sounds arrogant but I am not putting myself on high.&nbsp; I am simply stating a fact.&nbsp; I am a singer.&nbsp; Specifically, I am a classically trained opera singer.&nbsp; A tenore.&nbsp; I try to avoid saying opera singer really, mostly due to&nbsp; the numerous associations people have and the pictures they get in their minds.&nbsp; Like I said most people are stupid and they tend to generalize (" You're not fat" ).&nbsp; I call myself a singing actor beacause I am an actor.&nbsp; I am an actor that happens to sing.&nbsp; As i said i am a tenor (to be a real opera-geek I am what is&nbsp;called a Lirico-Spinto tenor by Italians, and a Jungendlicher Heldentenor by the Germans....in boxing terms I'm a middle weight).&nbsp; I live in NYC (Astoria, Queens) and am trying to get a performing career underway.&nbsp; I'd like to make my living perfoming in opera, musical theater, theater, or film.&nbsp; I don't have to be a mega-star or the 10th fourth tenor or anything of the sort.&nbsp; I simply want to be able to do what I am on this earth to "do" (aside from being a Dad, Partner, Son, Brother, Recovering Addict, etc).&nbsp; I want to be able to create characters and go through my "process" and inspire people, to move them to consider love, hope, compassion, beatuy, and other higher human truths.&nbsp; I have a need to express my humanity and I have something to share.&nbsp; But it ain't easy.&nbsp; Thus this blog is called a Tourney (for those of you who do not know what that mean please look it up&nbsp;here:   urlLink  http://dictionary.reference.com/   .&nbsp;) And let me tell you this performing thing AIN"T&nbsp;FREAKING&nbsp;EASY.&nbsp; This blog will be a a series of post about my progress or lack there of in trying to do this thing.&nbsp; This idea just came to me so I am not sure what my format will be exactly...it'll just be.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will stick mainly to the present or the very near future but I may also on occasion have a flashback or two(yes,&nbsp;THOSE kind as well).&nbsp; So have a look see, take a seat.....the show's about to start.&nbsp; Toi, toi, toi&nbsp;    &nbsp;!
