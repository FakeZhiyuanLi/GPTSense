      Hello. So once again here I am bored out of my fucking mind. Haha fuck. What a funny word. Anyway I'm contemplating wether I should call somebody up and do something or to just sit here and do nothing. It wouldn't be so hard to decide what to do if I didn't live in a terrible city. I shouldn't say it's terrible. We don't have a lot of shootings or anything. It's terrible just because it's sooo boring. There's only 2 places to go: the mall and the movie theatre. I'll probably go to see Hero with my friends when it comes out on Friday. It looks like a pretty cool movie. It probably isn't quite as good as Kill Bill then again what movie is?  School orientation is tomorrow. We're actually getting our pictures taken that day too. I hate picture day. The 9th graders go to school at the regular time while everyone else goes to school at like ten thirty. What could be a better way to have us feel normal and fit in than to have us come two or three hours earlier than everyone else. That's about it for today. Bye =)   urlLink http://www.killsometime.com/Pics/Funny/GetPicture.asp?PictureID=106  hahahahahahah  BTW http://qtdiary.blogspot.com/  I wonder if this is actually his diary.

      I tend to write a lot in this thing. Just like it says on the top, Random Stuff. There's so much stuff I want to write about ,but I can't process it into a whole paragraph. It's weird and extremely frusterating. I guess I'll write about school.  First off, I dont' want to go. Everyone says that it's the worst time of your life. I don't want to spend 9 months being judged academically and socially. I hate school. I hate popular people. The only comfort I have about them is that they'll fuck up school and spend their life on welfare ,and as Deron (CKY) said, "at a bar trying to connect with their party past." I hope they all have promiscuous sex with eachother and get numerous STD's and get pregnant. I hate how they make everyone feel like crap just to make themselves feel better. I'm sick of them and I'm sick of school and I'm sick of teachers who are condescending and treat their students like crap. I'm sick of all of this stuff and school hasn't even started yet. That's about it. On a better note just some websites I thought I'd pimp:   urlLink www.ckymusic.com   urlLink www.killsometime.com   urlLink www.ebaumsworld.com   urlLink www.tarantino.info/   urlLink www.maddox.xmission.com   urlLink www.rottentomatoes.com   urlLink www.goodcharlottesucks.com   urlLink www.adiofootwear.com   urlLink www.zumiez.com   urlLink http://manicdigest.blogspot.com/   urlLink

      Hi, my name's Lacey ,and the only reason I started this blog is because I am extremely BORED! I guess I'll just start by telling you about myself. I'm currently going into ninth grade. I have a very quiet family. They get on my nerves a lot ,but I know they still love me. I have two half brothers who are basically regular brothers because I've lived with them all my life. I have two sweet and adorable dogs, Dewey and Abby. I also have a horse (Claire) and a pony (Andy). My parents are very well off but they're always complaining about how they're "broke". My mom is going back to school to become a nurse and I'm very happy that she's doing something she wants to do. My dad works at a start up computer company and they have some potential buyers in their computer chips. My dad always tries to explain it to me ,but it goes over my head a lot of the time. I adore CKY. I think they are by far the best band I've ever heard. I saw them in June at the Mall of America. They just blew me away with how awesome they are. I want to see them again ASAP, this time at a smaller venue. Everyone who's seen them says you can hang out with them after the show and go drinking with them..... I wish I could!!!! I love everything that Quentin Tarantino has anything to do with. I loved Kill Bill and I think he really out did himself with that movie. I can't wait to see what he does with Inglorious Bastards. I hate Good Charlotte. That's about it for now. Later.
