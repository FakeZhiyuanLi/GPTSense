       So us women have a variety of choices when it comes to Birth Control. So I've decided to exercise my rite to change my mind. I have been taking "THE PILL" but its so hard sometimes to remember to take it. I mean especially in the wee morning hours and your late for work or you decide to sleep in - does it make it less effective. So instead of taking "THE PILL"  I'm trying "THE PATCH". But when you say this the first thing that comes to  mind to myself and the rest of the world - trying to quit smoking - but the reality of it is - no I'm trying not to have a child.       I started the patch yesterday - kinda odd- this 2 x 2 inch square on my lower back/butt area. Gotta make sure it stays on. It like having a bandaid on you. Well I always play with the ends of  my band aids or they end up rubbing off.  But the more I think about it - DAMN ITS GONNA HURT WHEN I TAKE IT OFF.        I mean it has to stay on for a week at a time. ever had a band aid on for a week then try to take it off - OUCH!!!! Nothing like a square mark just above your thong string - how attractive. I can just hear the comments now - why do you have a square on your ass -       My response - so I don't have offspring like you! Na I can't say that. The guys I've been intimate are smart and hot. Not that I'm saying I'm slutting around. I just left myself open for that comment huh . WHAT EVER!!!! ( a girls favorite word).      Well I'll let ya know how bad it hurts to peal the patch off my ass area next week.

      Job Hunting - what a grueling task . I am fortunate or unfortunate - guess that depends on how you look at - that I am in the current job market. I have been for about 2 months. Whew longest two months of my life - so far that is.  I've been on at least 15 interviews for job but nothing as far as job offers. Whew this task is harder than I thought - I've always been able to find a job but now I'm not looking for a "job" but more of a career . Maybe this is my problem- I'm not industry specific - I don't think that's a bad thing. I'm in the field of marketing - held many different positions in marketing public relations, advertising intern, promotions -field marketer, event manager. I want to stay in marketing but what can I do - I've got the skills from most aspects just not sure exactly what I want to do. And its really fustrating! I BORED OF MY ASS RIGHT NOW -  I JUST WANT TO WORK  - Never thought I'd ever say that but I miss working. Not sure if I could ever become a stay at home mom - I'd have to get some sort of job while the kids are at school or get some kinda of break. WHEW -  I've even considered going back to school. Law School that is. But that doesn't pay the bills in the immediate time frame. UGH - I could be called a professional interviewer  - put I'm not getting paid. I need money -  money money -  Having worked in the Employment industry - outplacement and job board site - I know the statistics - 16-20 weeks of being unemployed - I'm at 8 and I'm already going crazy not sure how much more I can take before I break down and take a crap job . But that's not my thing. I like the finer things in life. I  won't take a job just because I need the money. I have pride - nothing like going to a job you hate - what's the point. just cause its money. there is more to life than that-  I know I just said I need money money. but the fact is I'm not that desperate - YET - I want to be able to get up in the morning and enjoy my job - yes there are days where you would like to shove your job up your bosses ass but hey - every job has its moments. But usually the moments pass.  Yeah I'm justa rambling today but ya have those moments and since I'm not employed might as well publish my thoughts right -  Back to the job hunting trail - happy working or happing looking

        Gentleman please explain something to me. I just really don't get it.           When you get a blow job why do you use the line "WOW - that was incredible" . I mean seriously is there really such a thing as a bad blow job?  If so are you really going to tell the giver that it was bad.          Now I do understand every girls technique is different. Some girls deep throat it more, while others concentrate on the balls, while others make sure to pay attention to every nook and cranny - But getting head is getting head. Right?

        Call me nieve - whatever - but do guys just contact women to get aroused. I mean seriously - thanks for calling but do I really have to repeat back to you what we did or what we want to do to each other to get you going. I understand men tend to be more visual than women but come on don't ya wanna be touched as well... are there any guys out that are little bit more intuned to what a woman wants.           Yes - we definately have a lot of moments when we just want to get you aroused and make you climax but most time I think I can say we want to be caressed. Little more foreplay huh - Trantic sex gentleman - total turn on.

       The debate continues amongst my friends and I about the - You sleep with a guy the first night are you:      a slut     never gonna hear from him    checking to see if the sex would have potential for later relationship    letting out your pented sexual  fustrations    not girlfriend material     Feel free to let me know your thoughts.    One response given:    A girl sleeps with a guy on the first night - she's never gonna meet my parents.    Next response:    She sleeps with me on the first night - at least I can tell if she's good in the sack - if its bad a least I didn't wait 3 months or more to find out. The sex has to be good with the potential of getting better as the relationship goes . Hey maybe all my fantasies will come true.

       Let's just say if my head was not attached today I'd be a lost cause.  So it rains last night - I think to myself crap I left the moonroof open in the car - naah must be a wacky dream - tend to have a lot of those.       Wake up take the boys out (my dogs), check cell phone have a message - text message ohh - what messages -   Can't come 2 night - too sick,tired and broke maybe next fri   - I have no clue who sends this, no phone number to reference it to. very confused. Get a call from my Granny - my great great aunt Mary has passed away in here sleep, its not a bad thing, she would have been 100 this year - she told me plenty of stories of herself when she was young - I think I know where I get some of my antics from - hehe - cell rings its my dad - just checking in on his lil girl - aw sweet - go outside to take the call - UGH -is it humid outside- thought I was back in Florida again - realized I wasn't - no plam trees or lizards when I finally opened my eyes.  Other line rings - my date for tomorrow  - damn did catch it in time.  so anyway finish up call with date walk over to the car -    Yeah I'm a DUMBASS --- did leave the moonroof open - lucky for me the seats were already dry  = WHEW  relief ----       SO I'm sure I'll have some more brainiac moments today -I can just feel it -

      Ya know life is krazy - one minute is great and then a few minutes later - well lets just say the rug can get pulled right unda ya. Little bit about me - recently introduced to the world of singleville - by my choice - after 10 years, 8 of them being engaged, I had enough. Patience has run thin. SO the dating game - very dangerous for a girl like me. I was boy crazy in my teens - seems to be just a crazy now then ever - It's hard to keep them straight - guess I need to use a black book or is the pink book. But enjoying every bit of it -
