      I just wanted to post about Cpl. Wassef Ali Hassoun, who is a US Marine that has been captured by Terrorists in Iraq. My heart and prayers go out to him and his family in this time of need and trouble. I suggest that everyone who belongs so any faith, pray for this man, and his safety.   How many more heads do we have to see? How many more innocent men and women have to die before we realize that we are up against PURE EVIL? These Terrorists...not Muslims, TERRORISTS...are lower then scum, they do not even deserve to breath the same air as me, or you, they are the bottom of the barrel that is humanity.

      America is in a time of war, people are going to die, there is not one single way to avoid that. I don't mean to sound harsh, but it's the truth...something the Left has a very hard time seeing. Why is the Left so angry and hateful when it comes to this war? Why do they scream and chant "FREE PALASTINE!!!" and yet don't want the people if Iraq to be free? Let me tell you folks something about The Left: They hate America...not just the government, not just The Right, not just Bush...but ALL of America. They hate the people, as Michael Moore made evident when he said that "Americans were the dumbest people on the planet." They claim to want Freedom, yet their entire platform is based on MORE governmental intervention. They say they want Freedom of speech, that they respect everyone as an individual...all I have to say about this is Bullsh**. The Left only wants Free speech when it benifits them and there opinions. Don't believe me? Take a look at the Protest Warrior Videos over at www.protestwarrior.com, paticularly Operation: Wolverines. After watching their videos, you will have a whole new idea of The Left. No longer will they come across as the "compassionate" ones, or the "peace loving" ones.  Another thing about The Left you should know is that they think you are too dumb, and too ignorant to do anything on your own. If they could have it there way, we'd have people telling us what to wear, where to go, what to say, when to say it, and HOW to say it. What political ideology does The Left hold very near and dear to there hearts? Ever here of a little thing called Communism? You know, when political opposition is squashed, and anyone who thinks differently then the State is automatically exterminated? Thats what The Left wants for America.   Equality is one thing The Left really likes to play on, they say that if you come to their side, everyone will be equal. This is true, if you really think about it. If a hardcore Leftist, such as John Kerry, were to win the presidency, we would all be EQUALLY poor and miserable. Equality, ain't it great! Leftists are not out to help you, they are out to make you into their little puppets, they want to OWN you, they want to OWN your mind. They don't give a squat about individuallity, because individuallity means you have to think on your own, and thats not good for a Leftist leader. They want you to Comform, they want you to blend in, they don't want people, they want numbers, statistics.  When you get right down to it, The Left hates you, America, and the world for that matter. They want nothing more then to make you there own personal slaves. There is this thing, called the Constitution, maybe you've heard of it, and it says that every person has the right to Life, Liberty and the Prusuit of Happiness. I like to switch this around a little bit, and this is the Motto of the site, Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit to Leftists who threaten them!

      Several weeks ago at lunch, I got to talking about my weekly protests, which I am very admiment about. While I was going on with my rant, one of my friends looked to me and said, "Whitey, why do you care about the government and politics and all that crap? Its not like it effects you or anything." I looked at my friend in wide-eyed astonishment, thinking to myself, "did he REALLY just say that?!?!?!" No offence to my friend or anything, but Good Lord! Doesn't effect me? Are you serious?! Now while I was completely blown away at this statement, I kept my cool, which, needless to say, was pretty tough. I looked at him and said "How does it NOT effect me? Congress passes bills everyday that could alter our way of life forever, and I'm not supposed to care?" He looked generally intrigued, which is unusual for someone who is only passing because he's an EXCELLENT football player. He looked at me and replied "I just don't see how politics effect me, considering I'm not even old enough to vote yet." I wanted to give him a deep reply, something that he would hopefull remember. So I said "There are many types of politics, Governmental and Social. An example of Governmental Politics would be something like the Legal Drinking age being 21. Social politics would be something like you not being able to get even a C+ on a math test and yet are still passing the class because of your football Skills." Being the thick headed Jock my friend is, all he said was "I still don't see why you care."  What's sad is that this is the general attitude that most teens have towards politics. Why should they care? Why should it matter what the "adults" pass. I'll tell you why! Because in the not so distant future WE will be the adults, and we will have to live with the laws that Congress passes. I, for one, don't want my kid to come home from school one day and say "Dad, I met my friend Johnnys Parents today, they're names were Adam and Steve! It was cool that he has TWO dads!" No...not on my watch...not in MY name. I don't want to catch my kid smoking a joint and him saying "don't worry, dad, its legal!" Again, not in MY name.   Allow me to quote a line from a song by the Dropkick Murphys, the Song is called The New American Way: "The Morals of this nations youth have long gone astray, led by tolerance, indifference, and this kinder, gentler way that has corrupted and destroyed so many of our boys and girls, Oh Lord I wonder will it ever come around." I could not have said it better myself, they nailed it. In a world were you HAVE to be Politically Correct, where if you disrespect someone you will more likely then not to be sued, all we are is molding our kids to be Socialist Anti-Americans.   Political Correctness is probably one of the worst things that coould have happend to America, Political Correctness means always having to say you're sorry, even if you aren't! Blacks aren't Black...they're AFRICAN AMERICAN...but the White kid from South Africa is just that...a white kid, from South Africa.   Well this concludes my rant for the day, probably not one of my best written pieces but its how I feel at this point in time, and I know for a fact that I went a little off topic when I went off on PC, but hey, what can you do right?

      Imagine you're in a small town in rural Wyoming, population 5624. Many of you know that Wyoming is a very conservative/Right-Leaning state, so you would NEVER expect to see a protest against the War On Terror/Operation Iraqi Freedom here would you? That is where you are wrong, my friends. There is a man, and I use the term "man" very loosely, who, every Friday from 4:30-5:30PM, protests the War in Iraq. Now, this is all fine, it is his GOD GIVEN right to stand out there, and I'm not going to stop him from going out and putting that right into action. But there is one thing about this "man" that most people in the small down of Douglas, Wyoming are very ashamed and embarassed of. He is a cross dresser. He likes to walk around town in tu-tu's, tennis-skirts, cheer-leader outfits, and any other kind of skirt that shows off a little bit of leg. But, again, this is his right, and I'm not going to stop him from looking like a freak.   For the first 2-3 months that he did this, he was alone, he had no supporters with him, nor did he have any opposition. One Friday afternoon though, this all changed. Fed up with having this "mans" Leftist and immoral ideology shoved down my throat everytime I drove down center street, I, yes I, decided to take some action. I went out there with the only sign I had at the time, and that was a "Support President Bush and Our Troops" yard sign. It wasn't much, but I got my point across: Sissy, as he likes to be called, had been challenged, and it was from a 16 year old High-school student. Sissy, was not a happy camper.  For no less then an hour, I was called "Nazi" "Fascist" "Imperialist," by the man they call Sissy, while the people of Douglas gave me thumbs up, honked there horns, and some even pulled over and shook my hand. The show of support for me angered Sissy even FURTHER, and he went from attacking my politics, to attacking me personally. I went from "Nazi" to "ignorant boy who knows nothing of politics," from "Fascist" to "Brainwashed fool" and from "Imperialist" to "racist against Arabs and Muslims." Needless to say, I think I touched a nerve.  Now normally I wouldn't have taken such a verbal beating from anyone, let alone a "man" in a skirt, but this was differet, I was not only representing myself out there, but I was also representing all the right-wingers in Douglas, maybe even in Wyoming. I had to remain calm. I had to control myself. I had to stay strong.   And that folks, is how I have spent every Friday since January,and although I have new signs, with new slogans, such as "America: Land of the Free, Because of the Brave" and "In Valor There is Hope," they still carry the same message: The men and women of the armed forces, who are over in Afghanistan, and over in Iraq, and all over the world, are out there, right now, defending our freedom, and giving there lives in order to preserve the freedoms that some of us take advantage of. On Sept. 11th, 2001, there was no terrorist attack...there was an act of war, and we retaliated, and for some reason, that pissed the left off. I'm going to leave you with a saying that should be remembered by every American. You hear Leftists "War is Terrorism." Well, I think they just have there words a little mixed up, because War is NOT Terrorism...Terrorism is War.

      The following post is a speech I wrote for my English class earlier this year. We had to try and pursuade our audiance into agreeing with us, so I chose a topic that I felt VERY strong about...Saying the Pledge of ALlegiance in School. Another reason I chose this topic is because my english teacher is a raving, ranting, foam at the mouth, dye in the wool, Liberal/borderline Socialist and she believes ANYTHING that might make you proud to be an American is automatically EVIL because that is exactly what America is to her...evil. So anyway, I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.  The Pledge of Allegiance  The Pledge of Allegiance, it certainly has been in the news alot lately, but not for the reasons I'd like it to be. As of late, a certain group from the Left has been trying to take the Pledge out of every aspect of life: The work place, resturaunts, but most importantly, schools. I can think of no better time to start having DHS students say the Pledge of Allegiance during school. It isn't about just saying it anymore. You have to feel it. It's about pride for your country, its about pride for all the freedoms we have and its about support for the people who protect those freedoms with their lives.  I was sitting at home one day, flipping through the channals, as I'm sure many of you have done before, when I came to FoxNews. I paused for a moment to watch one of the greatest men in news; Bill O'Rielly. He was talking about an Athiest father who was offended by the Pledge because of 2 little words...Under God. He said he didn't want his daughter to be teased because of her Athiest beliefs. After this story hit the news...all HELL broke loose. You had the Liberals sayiing that we should be "compassionate about the girls beliefs, and do away with the Pledge in all schools everywhere. Alright, I can go along with this whole "compassion" thing. If we must show compassion to an athiest, shouldn't we also have to show compassion to a christian? Are you kidding...Liberals HATE everything America was built on! So therefore, they hate Christianity. Ever hear of the ACLU...that doesnt stand for American Civil Liberties Union, it stands for  ANTI-CHRISTIAN Liberties Union.  Other than being a source of pride for Americans, the Pledge has many more purposes. It is also a source of remembrance of what this country stands for and what it was built on: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. There is another way to say this quote, and it goes a little something like this: Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Liberals who threaten them! Good one huh? I thought so. Anyway, I would like to see the young adults of Douglas Wyoming have that sence of Pride, that sence of "compassion" for other people. There are people who are trying to take those away, and we must stop them.  Now I will tell you how I plan to enact this in to our school. Some of the students today will tell you that their plans will cost "X" amount of dollars, well, folks, saying the pledge once a day, once a week, or even once a month is free, you can't put a price tag on Pride. My plan is very simple, all we need is the cooperation of the students in our school. There will be some who don't want to stand and say the Pledge, and by all means that is there right. I'm not going to force them to say it. If they believe that America is the Evil, Imperialistic country the Leftist Media tells them it is then don't pledge to it I guess. Its a minute and a half everyday, every week, or every month, I think they'll live. All we have to do, is have somebody, a principal, a vice principal, somebody in authority, get on the intercom and say "Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. It isn't rocket science people.  In conclusion, all I'm asking is that we say the Pledge of Allegiance once or twice a month. This isnt difficult, and it doesnt have to be mandatory. All I want is for America's youth to be proud of being just that...America's youth. I want them to know that they live in the best country in the world, better then France, better then Germany, better then Great Britain. Some people will say "If thats true why does the whole world hate us???!!!" The answer to that question is very simple, they hate us because they want to BE us. What I want you to do right now is ask yourself once thing, do you want your children to grow up to hate the country that allows them to hate it in the first place?Is saying the pledge everday going to sway them from doing so? Possibly. Is it going to cause them to love everything this country stands for and believes in? Perhaps. In the end the pledge is one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written and also one of the most moving. It's simple and to the point, it doesn't beat around the bush, the author just went right to the point of things, and I think America should do the same.

      Most of you by now have heard how PEACE LOVING the Democrats are now-a-days. All you hear out of there mouths are "APPEASMENT" "LET THE UN TRY!" "ALL WE ARE SAYING! IS GIVE PEACE A CHANCE!" Well I guess John Kerry isn't the only Dem flipping waffles! Here are some quotes from everyones FAVORITE Dems!  "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." -- From a letter signed by Joe Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara A. Milulski, Tom Daschle, & John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998  "This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer- range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." -- From a December 6, 2001 letter signed by Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Harold Ford, & Tom Lantos among others  "Whereas Iraq has consistently breached its cease-fire agreement between Iraq and the United States, entered into on March 3, 1991, by failing to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction program, and refusing to permit monitoring and verification by United Nations inspections; Whereas Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological capabilities, and has made positive progress toward developing nuclear weapons capabilities" -- From a joint resolution submitted by Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter on July 18, 2002  "Saddam's goal ... is to achieve the lifting of U.N. sanctions while retaining and enhancing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. We cannot, we must not and we will not let him succeed." -- Madeline Albright, 1998  "(Saddam) will rebuild his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and some day, some way, I am certain he will use that arsenal again, as he has 10 times since 1983" -- National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Feb 18, 1998  "Iraq made commitments after the Gulf War to completely dismantle all weapons of mass destruction, and unfortunately, Iraq has not lived up to its agreement." -- Barbara Boxer, November 8, 2002  "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability. Intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons, but has not yet achieved nuclear capability." -- Robert Byrd, October 2002  "There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat... Yes, he has chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long time. But the United States right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001... He is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we." -- Wesley Clark on September 26, 2002  "What is at stake is how to answer the potential threat Iraq represents with the risk of proliferation of WMD. Baghdad's regime did use such weapons in the past. Today, a number of evidences may lead to think that, over the past four years, in the absence of international inspectors, this country has continued armament programs." -- Jacques Chirac, October 16, 2002  "The community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists. If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow." -- Bill Clinton in 1998  "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security." -- Hillary Clinton, October 10, 2002  "I am absolutely convinced that there are weapons...I saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out." -- Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April of 2003  "Iraq is not the only nation in the world to possess weapons of mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader who has used them against his own people." -- Tom Daschle in 1998  "Saddam Hussein's regime represents a grave threat to America and our allies, including our vital ally, Israel. For more than two decades, Saddam Hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every available means. We know that he has chemical and biological weapons. He has already used them against his neighbors and his own people, and is trying to build more. We know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons, and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal." -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002  "The debate over Iraq is not about politics. It is about national security. It should be clear that our national security requires Congress to send a clear message to Iraq and the world: America is united in its determination to eliminate forever the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction." -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002  "I share the administration's goals in dealing with Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction." -- Dick Gephardt in September of 2002  "Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." -- Al Gore, 2002  "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction." -- Bob Graham, December 2002  "Saddam Hussein is not the only deranged dictator who is willing to deprive his people in order to acquire weapons of mass destruction." -- Jim Jeffords, October 8, 2002  "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." -- Ted Kennedy, September 27, 2002  "There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious danger, that he is a tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed." -- Ted Kennedy, Sept 27, 2002  "I will be voting to give the president of the United States the authority to use force - if necessary - to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." -- John F. Kerry, Oct 2002  "The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation." -- John Kerry, October 9, 2002  "(W)e need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime. We all know the litany of his offenses. He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. ...And now he is miscalculating America’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. That is why the world, through the United Nations Security Council, has spoken with one voice, demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but it is not new. It has been with us since the end of the Persian Gulf War." -- John Kerry, Jan 23, 2003  "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandates of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." -- Carl Levin, Sept 19, 2002  "Every day Saddam remains in power with chemical weapons, biological weapons, and the development of nuclear weapons is a day of danger for the United States." -- Joe Lieberman, August, 2002 "Over the years, Iraq has worked to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. During 1991 - 1994, despite Iraq's denials, U.N. inspectors discovered and dismantled a large network of nuclear facilities that Iraq was using to develop nuclear weapons. Various reports indicate that Iraq is still actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability. There is no reason to think otherwise. Beyond nuclear weapons, Iraq has actively pursued biological and chemical weapons.U.N. inspectors have said that Iraq's claims about biological weapons is neither credible nor verifiable. In 1986, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran, and later, against its own Kurdish population. While weapons inspections have been successful in the past, there have been no inspections since the end of 1998. There can be no doubt that Iraq has continued to pursue its goal of obtaining weapons of mass destruction." -- Patty Murray, October 9, 2002  "As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." -- Nancy Pelosi, December 16, 1998  "Even today, Iraq is not nearly disarmed. Based on highly credible intelligence, UNSCOM [the U.N. weapons inspectors] suspects that Iraq still has biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic missile warheads, as well as the means to continue manufacturing these deadly agents. Iraq probably retains several tons of the highly toxic VX substance, as well as sarin nerve gas and mustard gas. This agent is stored in artillery shells, bombs, and ballistic missile warheads. And Iraq retains significant dual-use industrial infrastructure that can be used to rapidly reconstitute large-scale chemical weapons production." -- Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter in 1998  "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years. And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources -- something that is not that difficult in the current world. We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002  "Saddam’s existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America, now. Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq’s enemies and against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East." -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002  "Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Administration’s policy towards Iraq, I don’t think there can be any question about Saddam’s conduct. He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do. He lies and cheats; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the United Nations, the Security Council, the United States and our allies. Those are simply the facts." -- Henry Waxman, Oct 10, 2002

      The Liberal Brainwashing of America's Youth 	Most people my age these days are busy worrying about where the next party is and who they can pay to buy them some alcohol. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, nor am I saying I haven't worried about it, I just dont worry about it as much as others do. While others are trying to score some beer or some weed, I'm trying to score some political insight. While others are trying to get some sex, I'm trying to get my views across in anyway possible. I'm different, there's no doubt about it. The state of American youth these days is sad, almost sickening. I am one of the few, one of the different, one of the proud, I actually know who's running this country, and I also know how to think for myself. In this speech I will touch on the Liberal bias in the media and high schools, and the effect it has on the American Youth, as well as other subjects. I have bitten my tongue until its bled, I have held back my views, and now I'm done, so prepare to be slapped in the face with the 2x4 that IS reality. 	Most people that know me know me as an energetic and spontanious teenager, always up to try something new and always willing to listen. There are few, though, that know the political and insightful side of me. I save this for when it is needed, there is a time and a place for that, and personally I don't think school is one of them. School should be a place for students to go to learn about the basic fundementals of life, and how they will need them later in life, not a place of political indoctorine. Go to any college in America and find a conservative student, chances are that they will tell you that there is a huge, almost sickening, liberal bias in American colleges, mainly in English, Journalism, and Literature departments.Now I could go on and on and on with accusations and other things of that sort, but thats not going to do anything except make me look like a, well, a liberal. So here's some fun little facts brought to you by 20 year old UCLA Senior, and nationally syndicated writer Ben Shepario:  Seventy-nine percent of college professors feel that George W. Bush is too conservative. Forty percent of college professors are in favor of slavery reparations. Sixty-five percent are against tax cuts. Nope...no bias here. 	 This goes for High Schools too, and small High Schools such as Douglas High School are not exempt. Early in the first Semester, I was sitting in English one day, when our teacher said "Ok Kids lets get our books out and read!" Now, I am a very sarcastic person as many of you know, so I leaned over to my friend and said "I can't read, the Commies have invaded my mind." I didn't even think she could hear, but apparently she did. This is were it gets interesting. Next thing I know our teacher is flying off the handle, so to speak. After a few sputtered sentence fragments and and other various noises she says to me "Cathan, I want you to do a report on Communist Olympic gold medalists, Scientists and Nobel Peace Prize Winners!" Now most students would have been a little angry at this, but like I said, I'm different. I was all but jumping up and down with joy. Now, I would absolutly LOVE to share every little piece of information I found for that report, but I'm on a time limit here, so I'll just give you a few tid bits. Anyway, I'll just skip down to Nobel Peace Prize winners...mainly because this is where the best line in the entire report was. After extensive research about nobel peace prize winners, I only found ONE that was communist. I'll just read to you what I wrote at the end of that. It read, and I quote "So, as you can see, there was one Soviet scientist who won the nobel peace prize, count them again, ONE!"  	American teens...probably one of the saddest age groups this day and age. Most are too busy trying to get laid, and scoring weed and beer to care about what's going on in there country. Few have morals, and the ones that do are called wimps, prudes, and squares. This, if you ask me, is happening because of the even sadder state of American television. I am in no way for censorship of any kind, but some people should have some decency. Movies and TV shows are nothing but violence, sex, violence, sex,I've seen very few shows that have any kind of positive message in them, but there are some. It's horrible that teens don't think for themselves, going off of what they hear and see on TV and radio, both Liberally charged. I have a message for my peers: Listen to Rush Limbaugh!!! The man is a GENIUS, he is the Silent Majorities (Conservatives) voice in the media, his is reason, he is logic, he knows all! Think for yourselves is what I say to America's youth, but always agree with Rush Limbaugh.  	For those of you who say there is no Bias in the media...you need to come out of whatever drug-induced coma you've been in. There was a Pro-America, Pro-Democracy rally in Iraq where hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of Iraqies came showed support for us, but did you hear about THAT on CNN? How bout MSNBC? Guess where I heard it? No, not Fox News..even THEY didn't show it. I read it on the INTERNET at a conservative news site Newsmax.com. Now think about all the Anti-American protests we've seen on the air...there have been ton's, but the ONE Pro-American rally there is, the media is silent. But hey, there's no Liberal bias in American Media, right? HAH! For every protest against America there is, I'm willing to bet theres 3-4 Pro-American ones, but what could I know. 	Now I just mentioned the Liberal Bias in the media, and mostly talked about the news, in this part of my speech I'm going to talk to you about Americas music industry, Punk music in peticular. I chose punk mainly because that is what I listen to, and I have noticed with bands such as NOFX and Anti-Flag, all they are doing is pushing a one track thought system in the punk scene, something that the scene has been fighting since the beginning. They think that anyone who is proud to be American is automatically a Fascist, take this line on how the band Anti-Flag go their name; it has been edited so it is appropriate for the young children in the audience: "The name was originally inspired as a result of the late 80's Pittsburgh scene being infiltrated by a bunch of ass holes who toted the slogan, "Freedom not fascism". Well, that would've been great if these jerks practiced what they preached, but unfortunately, their idea of punk rock was VERY fascist! They took to sporting the American flag on their jackets, and saying the pledge of allegiance to the flag." So, according to these Liberals...Wearing an American flag and saying the pledge makes you a Fascist. Well folks, in that case I guess I'd better change my name to Benito Mussolini because I certainly qualify for their type of Fascism. There's a place where these bottom-feeders go to talk about how its all the a Vast Right Wing Conspiracy...this place is called Punk Voter. To these people, every single solitary problem in the world is at the fault of America. Gas prices America's fault, Mumia Abu Jamal killing a cop in cold blood...conspiracy of the CIA. 	There are exceptions to the Liberal Rule in punk. Bands like Down By Law, The Dickies, and, my personal favorite, The Dropkick Murphys are all conservatives. If you don't believe me here are some Dropkick lyrics from the chorus of Front Seat: We'll take the front seat mister, and we're never gonna take the back, we'll take the front seat, mister, liberal scum to the back. If you ask me any band that mentions the words "Liberal scum" is alright by me! And here, a line or two from their biography: You can preach till you're blue in the face but if you're lying in the gutter no one's gonna listen. If you pick yourself up by the bootstraps and live your life to the best of your ability you may set an example that others will follow. Key words in that right there...Self-Improvement. Liberals don't believe in SELF-improvement, they believe that the government should improve you because to them your to stupid to do it yourself. You don't know whats good for you, because your just an idiotic subhuman, so let US make your life decisions for you, thats Liberal thinking for you.  	Now, through out this speech I have made it clear where I stand politically and I certainly hope I have helped you find out where you personally stand. One of the main goals I had in reading this speech is to educate, I want you, the audience, to know that there is a huge difference between what is happening in the world and what we as Americans are being told. We are told that the entire world hates us, that we are despised internationally. All I can say to the people who say this is, who cares? We're America, we are easily one of the most prosperous, and freest nations in the world, and thats how it is whether you want to admit it or not. They say France is right, my friend, again who cares what France says. All I can say about that arguement is that I'd much rather live poverty stricken in America, then be the president of France. I would like to leave you with a quote by a great man, Winston Churchill. "If a man is not a Liberal in his youth, he has no heart, if not a conservative in his adulthood, he has no brain." Some of you maybe asking "Whitey, does that mean you have no heart?" And the answer to that is no, it doesnt mean i have no heart, it just means that I developed a brain a lot faster then some. Thank you, and good evening.

      Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my blog, The Reaganista! This is a place where I, Whitey McCracka, can rant and rave to anyone who may run across my little space on the world wide web. Now before I start some actual posting let me tell you a little about myself.  I am a 16 year old Junior in High School and I am extremely politically active, as you will certainly find out later! I go by Whitey McCracka, though it is not my real name, just a nick name. None of you will EVER get my real name unless I already know you...in which case you will not need it. As for the origins of this name, it comes from my physical appearance, white skin, white hair, all white; hence WHITEY. As for McCracka...anyone who is up on racial epitephs you are well aware that the term "Cracker" is a slur for people of fair complexion. Now I am also of Irish Heritage, hence the "Mc." Now if you put that all together what do you get??? Thats right! Whitey McCracka!  Now that we know where I got my name, lets go into why I started this Blog. As many of you know, there is a very large, if not huge, left-leaning media bias. How many of you know about the Prison Abuse Scandles? All of you, of course, unless you have been in a coma for the past 2 months. Now, how many of you know about the Sarin Gas that exploded in Iraq a couple of weeks ago? *cricket chirps* Thats what I thought. The current Media is absolutly HELL BENT making Bush, The War on Terror, and Right-Wingers in General look bad. Well, folks, your looking at one of the few, one of the proud, yes, you guessed it, this is a Right-Wing Blog! All Liberals, Greens, Progressives, Socialists and Communists are all welcome, but be warned, some of the things you'll read here, you may not like, you may not agree with, and you just hate all together, but these are things I think need to be said, so I'm going to say them.  Now that you have the skinny on me and why I'm here...lets get to business shall we???  PS: I would like to thank Paul Motes For the term "The Reaganista"...Pure genius my friend!

      On one of the many message boards I frequent, one poster put this poem up that he'd gotten in an email, and I figured I might as well share it with all of you! This poem is great. So give it a read!    A POEM FOR THE FRENCH     &nbsp;Eleven thousand soldiers lay beneath the dirt and stone,      all buried on a distant land so far away from home.      For just a strip of dismal beach they paid a hero's price,      to save a foreign nation they all made the sacrifice.        &nbsp;   And now the shores of Normandy are lined with blocks of white,      Americans who didn't turn from someone else's plight.      Eleven thousand reasons for the French to take our side,      but in the moment of our need, they chose to run and hide.        &nbsp;   Chirac said every war means loss, perhaps for France that's true,      for they've lost every battle since the days of Waterloo.      Without a soldier worth a damn to be found in the region,      the French became the only land to need a Foreign Legion.        &nbsp;   You French all say we're arrogant. Well hell, we've earned the right      We saved your sorry nation when you lacked the guts to fight.      But now you've made a big mistake, and one that you'll regret;      you took sides with our enemies, and that we won't forget.        &nbsp;   It wasn't just our citizens you spit on when you turned,      but every one of ours who fell the day the towers burned.      You spit upon our soldiers, on our pilots and Marines,      and now you'll get a little sense of just what payback means.        &nbsp;   So keep your Paris fashions and your wine and your champagne,      and find some other market that will buy your aeroplanes.      And try to find somebody else to wear your French cologne,     &nbsp;for you're about to find out what it means to stand alone.     &nbsp;     You see, you need us far more than we ever needed you.      America has better friends who know how to be true.      I'd rather stand with warriors who have the will and might,      than huddle in the dark with those whose only flag is white.        &nbsp;   I'll take the Brits, the Aussies, the Israelis and the rest,      for when it comes to valor we have seen that they're the best.      We'll count on one another as we face a moment dire,      while you sit on the sideline with a sign "friendship for hire."        &nbsp;   We'll win this war without you and we'll total up the cost,      and take it from your foreign aid, and then you'll feel the loss.      And when your nation starts to fall, well Frenchie, you can spare us,      just call the Germans for a hand, they know the way to Paris

      Since I first became active in politics, people have always asked me why I think the way I think, and why I believe what I believe. Pretty much why I am a conservative. Well I'm going to dedicate this post to try and explain those questions to you.   Why am I a Conservative?&nbsp;Because I believe that you should have to work for what you own, not just have it handed to you on a silver platter. I don't believe in government handouts, unless the situation is extreme. If you start off successful, and all of a sudden something tragic and ireversable happens, and you lose absolutly everything, then a little pick me up maybe in order. But if you are perfectly capable of getting a steady paying and safe job, and you just flat out don't WANT to, then I don't think my tax dollars should go to you, at all. You maybe wondering what taxes that I, a 16 year old in Wyoming, would pay. Well, folks, everytime I buy something I'm paying taxes, its called a sales tax, and I don't believe that even 5 cents for every dollar should go to some scumbag who is capable of, but not willing to get a job. I'm not against welfare, I am against abuse of the system. Sometimes things just happen, we can't stop them and we can't change them. But sometimes people are just lazy and need a good kick in the ass to get off the couch and get a job.  Why am I a Conservative? Because I believe in the Right to Life. Our fore-fathers wrote it in the Constitution, that every man, woman, and child has the&nbsp;  inalienable rights  &nbsp;to   Life,   Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Did you catch that?   Inalienable right to life.   Leftists believe that a woman should have the right to choose if she wants to keep her baby alive or not. The right to choose huh? So, what the Left is saying, that if I don't want somebody around, in this case a fetus, I can just terminate them, right? Well Abortion is murder, so, if you look at it like that, if I don't want someone around, say someone who beat me up in the past, I can just "terminate" them right? If you said this to any Leftist in America they'd say "NO! Thats murdering somebody who is alive!" Well, so is abortion. Life starts at conception whether you want to admit it or not, and if you don't, well, you're wrong. I differ from some conservatives in how I think we should deal with abortion, however, I don't believe that we should ban abortion. What I DO think we should do is classify it as Murder, which is exactly what it is, then we wont have to worry about it, do we?  Why am I a Conservative? Because I believe that Marriage is, and should stay, between a man and a woman. If we allow Gay Marriage in America, what's stopping people from wanting to legalize beastiality? Or Incest? If we allow Gay Marriage in America, we will spiral into moral decay, and our civilization will end. Don't mean to sound too pessimistic, but its the truth, and you know it.   Why am I a Conservative? Because I am DAMN proud to be an American. This is the best country in the world, no matter how you look at it. We have more freedom then any other nation in the world. And with that Freedom comes responsibility, something the Left wants to get rid of all together, but thats another topic. Patriotism and American Pride are a very large part of why I align myself with the Right. Just because you don't have pride for a certain administration, or a certain president, or a certain law maker, doesn't mean you can't have pride for the freedoms and liberties you have to vote that Administration, president, or lawmaker out of office. If John Kerry wins the election come November, I will still be damn proud of being American, and I will still have respect for the Presidential Office, maybe not the man who holds that office, but the office itself I will have immense respect for.  Why am I a Conservative? Because I believe strongly in the second amendment, our right to bear arms. The Left wants to strip the average law abiding American citizen of their guns, thinking that it will reduce crime. Wrong! The people commiting the crimes will STILL get guns, and STILL rob, rape, and kill unarmed, law abiding Americans. If you take away our guns, you put them in the hands of criminals, theres no two ways about it.&nbsp; This part of this post isn't going to need to be too long because it pretty much explains itself: You take away our guns, you take away our Liberty. End of Story.  SO there you have it, folks! I'm a Red blooded, Pro-Life, anti-gay marriage, gun-loving and DAMN PROUD American. THAT is why I, Whitey McCracka, am a Conservative.

      Alright, let me give you a background story before I get in to the juicey details.&nbsp; I recently just finished taking the American Red Cross's lifegaurd certifcation class, so I can possibly get a job at my home-town pool, and today we went to a lifegaurd inservice with all the hired lifegaurds so we could see how things work and how they prepare for emergancies and such. Let me start off by saying that all of this started at 8 in the morning, I hadn't even had breakfast yet, not even a Mountain Dew, so needless to say I was out of it. This is where the story gets good!  &nbsp;  So I'm sitting there, eating a donut, half awake, when someone brings up the Friday Protest that I part take in every week (see Protesting the Leftist Ideology for background on that.) Now, one of the life gaurds there is a Leftist..to say the very least. She has written tons of letters to the nespaper critisizing Bush, The GOP, and Right-Wingers in general. Shes Michael Moore...just a lot better looking. Anyway, she asked me if I was for, or against Sissy, she didn't know because she spends most of her time in College in Nebraska. The dialogue went something like this: &nbsp; Me: I'm very must against him &nbsp; Her: Well why? &nbsp; Me: Because I can be &nbsp; Her: Well whats your reasoning, your rational? &nbsp; Me: Personally, I believe that its disgraceful and disrespectful that our troops go over there, liberate 25+ million people, and he has the audacity to say that they are over there for oil and money. &nbsp; Her: He's not protesting the War...he's protesting us being over there!&nbsp;  I'm   a Political Science Major, Whitey,   I   know what I'm talking about. &nbsp; Me: The funny thing about Political Science is that even if your wrong, if you have a degree in it, you can still be considered an expert.  &nbsp; Her: Well most people in Iraq actually want Saddam back in power you know! &nbsp; Me (with a look of utter shock at what I'd just heard) And where have you been getting your news from? What are your sources? &nbsp; Her: From the news &nbsp; Me: What news? &nbsp; Her: Well I watch all the news channals...well except for FoxNews...its propagandist &nbsp; Me: Ok, lets get back to the topic, because what YOU just said put you with the likes of Michael Moore, thus destroying what little credibility you had. You believe that the War in Iraq was wrong and we never should have gone there. I believe that we liberated 25 million people. You're not going to change my mind, and I'm not going to change yours. End of story &nbsp; Her: Well is that YOUR opinion or your PARENTS?! &nbsp; Me: Well is it YOUR opinion or your Poli Sci Professors? &nbsp; Her: WELL YOUR JUST IGNORANT AND STUPID! (stomps off like a child) &nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen, what you just read was a transcript of a 16 year old (Me, your buddy Whitey McCracka) owning a Political Science Major in college ("Her" the foaming at the mouth Liberal) Yes, yes...give it a second to sink in...Ok!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Alright, I'm just going to come right out and say it: Hillary Clinton is a Communist. Not a Leftist, not a Socialist...a Communist. This woman hates Freedom, Prosperity, and Happiness...unless of course, LIKING those things will help her out in the long run. Get a load of this quote by The Far Lefts sweetheart:    "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you," Sen. Clinton said. "We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good."    Let me reiterate that last line: "We're going to  TAKE THINGS AWAY FROM YOU ON BEHALF OF THE COMMON GOOD " If that isn't at least SOCIALISTIC I don't know what is. What average American wants the government to take more money away from them than they already do? Honestly, think about it! The Government takes at least 10% of your income every paycheck in Income Taxes alone. They then take more out for health care, social security, and any other rediculous excuse to make you poor and miserable. I don't know if I'm alone in this, but when I work hard, I want to get what I deserve, and I want ALL of what I deserve, I don't want the government to take my money and give it to some social welfare program that I disagree with to begin with!  Speaking of Welfare, I think now would be an appropriate time for me to tell you wonderful folks how I feel on that issue. I'll start off by saying that I'm not for the total destruction of welfare, sometimes people need a little help getting back on there feet after something bad happens. It's when people take advantage of the system that makes me mad. When someone is on welfare for more then lets say, 2-3 years, and are totally capable of getting a steady paying job, I say screw them! If they think that everything is going to be handed to them with out them having to do an ounce of labor they have another thing coming! I'm not going to work MY ass off, just so that the government can give it to some lazy, jobless scum bag with 300 kids.   Anyway, back to Hillary Clinton! This woman gives Ted Kennedy a run for his money when it comes to being the most Liberal person in Washington! I can tell you one thing, if she gets into the White House, with a Democratic Senate and House, we are all screwed! Within her first months taxes would skyrocket, welfare and social programs would run everything, and there would be no such thing as an "individual" just the "common good."   I'm going to leave you with this question: Do you want yet ANOTHER Clinton in the White House? Shes not running yet, but she will be in 2008, no doubt about it. Do you want another 4-8 years of scandal, hypocrisy and lies? Think about that.

      This is a little piece of a news paper artical from Seattle, Washington. It talks about how an Iraq War Veteran was treated by his peers and neighbors apon his return. Ahhh, The Left...so tolerant, so loving, so peaceful!   Think about the Seattle area -- Bainbridge Island to be exact -- and you think scenic views and liberal-minded tolerance.  At least the killer views are still there.   The bucolic island's deep reputation for civility got a gut check this week during the annual Grand Old Fourth of July celebration.  That's when Jason Gilson, a 23-year-old military veteran who served in Iraq, marched in the local event. He wore his medals with pride and carried a sign that said "Veterans for Bush."  Walking the parade route with his mom, younger siblings and politically conservative friends, Jason heard words from the crowd that felt like a thousand daggers to the heart.  "Baby killer!"  "Murderer!"  "Boooo!"  To understand why the reaction of strangers hurt so much, you must read what the young man had written in a letter from Iraq before he was disabled in an ambush:        "I really miss being in the states. Some of the American public have no idea how much freedom costs and who the people are that pay that awful price. I think sometimes people just see us as nameless and faceless and not really as humans. ... A good portion of us are actually scared that when we come home, for those of us who make it back, that there will be protesters waiting for us and that is scary."  On the Fourth, Jason faced his worst fear.  It was such a public humiliation -- home front insult after battlefield injury.   This is an example of the disgusting, disrespectful, and absolute hatred that the left has for the men and women that fight for our freedom! You don't have to agree with the war, but at least support the men and women in uniform! For all of you Leftists out there...and you know who you are...you scum bags should be ashamed of yourselves! It's one thing to voice your opinion against the War in Iraq, but it is quite another to personally attack an individual simply because he, not only fought but became injured, in a war you disagree with! Wheres the tolerance, indifference, and love that you hold so dearly?! Oh right! Thats just a cover-up for your true agenda...destroying American Freedom, and freedom around the world.   Take a look at the news artical my friends, this is the Kerry/Edwards voting base, these are the people that support them; do you really want these kind of people to decide who runs our country? This concludes my rant for the day, I'll see you soon.

      For this post, I want to take up some of your time to appreciate our men and women over in Iraq and abroad that are fighting for our freedom. They are making the ultimate sacrifice so that we can remain a free and proud nation, and for that, they have my utmost respect. These people are going over to a foriegn country (and currently soverigine I might add) and defeating evil every single day.   Some of you may have heard of a man named Patrick Tillman, a former football player who gave up a 3+ million dollar contract with the Arizona Cardinals, in order to go preserve American Freedom in Afghanistan. I want you to ask yourself one question: Would you have given up that kind of money to fight for America? Honestly, would you? Would you give up a million dollar mansion, expensive cars, fancy resturaunts and all the luxeries that come with being wealthy? If you answered yes then you also have my utmost respect, but the chances of you saying "yes" and being 100% honest with your self is very slim. Pat Tillman is true American, and a true hero.  When I think about the men and women in our military, I think of someone who is willing to sacrifice everythin in order to make America safer, and to those people, home and abroad, I thank you. No longer are the days where I consider TV stars, or sports stars my heros, nope, those days are over. You, the men and women serving our country, are the true heros, and deserving of all the treatment that comes along with that status.   If you have a family member or a friend serving in Iraq, or in Afghanistan, or anywhere else in the world, please tell them that a blogger back home, named Whitey McCracka thanks them for there sacrifice and valor.

      Well it's finally here, folks, one of the greatest holidays in America, perhaps even the world...even though the rest of the world doesn't celebrate it. Yes, the holiday I speak of is the 4th of July. Fireworks, BBQ's the whole 9 yards, it is going to be a blast. There are some people, however, that don't know what The 4th is REALLY about; so I, Whitey McCracka, will give you, my faithful readers, the skinny on the meaning.   The 4th of July, for those of you who don't know, is America's Independence Day. It is a day that should be cherished by all Freedom Loving Americans, because it is the reason that we are the country that we are today. If it weren't for our brave and couragous Founding Fathers, who stood up to the then most powerful country in the world, we would be nothing more then a British colony, and honestly...who would want that? The 4th is a time to reflect on the men and women in uniform that give there lives for us to say what we want, do what we want, and be who we want, without having any kind of state oppression to stop us.   But, since there are people who love, and cherish our God given freedom, there are naturally those who dispise and hate it. You know who I'm talking about, thats right...The Left. The question is why do they hate the country that allows it to hate to begin with? Because they hate the thought of people bettering themselves, they believe that the state should do EVERYTHING for you, including wipe your ass. They want to turn America into a fat, lazy, irresponsible Socialist "Utopia" where everyone shares the work, and the profits. Let me explain how Socialism works really quick here. Let's say you work your butt off, I mean you work to near exhaustion, you WILL get what you deserve, theres no doubt about that. Now lets say your friend, Bob we'll say his name is, doesn't do ANYTHING, not a thing, just stands there and does nothing. He too, will get what YOU deserve. Socialism promotes laziness because everything is handed to you, and you are encouraged not to work.  Anyways! Back on topic! The Left absolutly HATES the 4th of July for mainly one reason; it promotes pride, and we all know that Leftists hate pride..especially when its pride in being American. You can be proud of being Black, you can be proud of being Latin/Mexican, you can be proud of being Arabic, but if your proud of being American you are nothing more then a Fascist Nazi and are not worthy of living.   I have a message for The Left, and Leftists out there: I'm proud of being American, I am DAMN proud of it, and I wouldn't trade the life I live or the country I live in for anything in the world. This is America, Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, and you hate it. You are nothing but a Self-Hating Anti-American Leftist, and you're to thick headed and ignorant to change that. You, and others like you, have nothing to offer America except hate, and discontent for what the majority holds dearly; mostly Freedom. You hate a country that gives you the right to hate it in the first place, and you REVEL in that hatred. Get a clue, get a job, make money, and be happy.   Happy 4th of July everyone, I hope you have a safe, and wonderful holiday.

      The Former Iraqi Dictator, Saddam Hussein, went on trial this morning in Baghdad. He claims that all the charges against him are false and that George W. Bush is "the real criminal." Funny, I don't recall Bush gassing a certain ethnic group in the Southern part of America? Do you? Hmm...must have missed that one on FoxNews. According to links on the Drudge Report, Saddam  still  refers to himself as "Saddam Hussien Al-Majid, President of The Republic of Iraq." Ok, first off, Iraq was NOT a Republic under this nut jobs power, it was a Socialist Totalitarian Dictator Ship...but socialists like to cover up there true meanings with fancy pretty words, like "Republic."   When the charges were brought to him during the arraingment at Camp Victory, one of his MANY former palaces (hows that for irony?)he refused to accept the charges with out a lawyer present, as if they might go away when he showed up. When asked about Kuwait he said, referring to himself in the third person, "How could Saddam be tried over Kuwait that said it will reduce Iraqi women to 10-dinar prostitutes? He defended Iraq's honor and revived its historical rights over those dogs." For one thing, anybody who likes to refer to themselves in the third person is NOT to be trusted, its just creepy, and for another, at that point in time Iraq had no honor to defend.   There were a total of 7 charges brought against Saddam today, including killing of religious figures in 1974; gassing of Kurds in Halabja in 1988; killing the Kurdish Barzani clan in 1983; killing members of political parties in the last 30 years; the 1986-88 "Anfal" campaign of displacing Kurds; the suppression of the 1991 uprisings by Kurds and Shiites; and the 1990 invasion of Kuwait...and remember folks the Left didn't think he posed ANY threat what-so-ever. The Left...always looking out for you...when it benifits them.   Now it's time for ol' Whitey McCracka to rant! The fact that Liberals and other leftists still think it was a bad thing that we went over there, took names and kicked ass, baffles me beyond belief. How can these people look at the charges brought against this twisted individual and then look me and you in the eye and say "it was wrong, Sadaam posed no threat?" Thats what I want to know! There is a quote by the great conservative thinker Edmund Burke, "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." What might've happend if America had stood by and done nothing about Saddam Hussein? There is a possibility, and more then a slight one, that we would all be nothing but bones, decomposing after a massive nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon had landed smack dab in the middle of our great country.   You can call me a Fascist, you can call me a Nazi, you can call me anything you want, but do NOT disrespect MY country, MY family, MY friends, or any of MY loved ones, and expect to get off scott free. Saddam Hussein had the audasity to mess with America, and he will pay the price, as will every, single, solitary member of any terrorist organization that has the balls and out right stupidity to kill Americans.
