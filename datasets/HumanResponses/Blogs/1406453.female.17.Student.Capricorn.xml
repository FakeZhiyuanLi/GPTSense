      Been a long 2 days...  Christy somehow convinced me that yesterday it would be a good idea to go to the gym at 6 am.  So I went to the gym at 6, home by 7, showered, left 15 minutes later, dropped Mom off @ work (we're carpooling these days since I'm bbsitting in Chula Vista) and went to my job.  Four hours, 2 games of tennis, and one Disney movie later, I dropped off Debbie at camp, picked up her sister from summer school, and brought her home.  Then Starbucks and lunch, an audiology appt. up North, back home for a student, then a Jewish Concert in Balboa Park @ 6:15.  As you might imagine, I basically passed out when I got home.  Sleepytime. Today I woke up and filled the car with gas, and I'm @ work right now.  Should be another fun-filled day.  Will update later.

      I slept late today, which was the source of concern on the part of my mom.  My parents assume sleeping from 1 a.m. to 10 a.m., eating breakfast, then going back to sleep for an hour means I have an iron deficiency or I'm depressed or something.  I'm just tired.  Period. Cleaned house, then headed over to visit with Julia and Aunt Jody.  She leaves for Israel in a couple of days, and I am really worried for her safety.  It's a dangerous place.  Then Chinese food and Pistachio yogurt. Off to see the world in my dreams.  Work tomorrow a.m., should be fun babysitting.  woopee...

      I just returned from the movie, "The Notebook".  What amazing acting! I was very impressed by the music, too, although the editing left a bit to desire.  The whole 365 love letters story was very endearing- what it must be like!  It seems like such an incredible era to live in. Also went to the fair today.  Not much to say, spent a lot of money, did many things.  Not so impressive, but good excercise between the walk to the car and the people I had to shove my way thru.  Oy. Looking forward to a quiet tomorrow.  P.S. 5 year anniversary of my Bat Mitzvah today!

      It's official: I'm lazy.  Woke up at 9:30 this morning only to realize that my gym buddy was grounded, and that I couldn't gather up enough courage to go it alone in the cold, sweaty and very unfamiliar territory.  So, what did I do all day?  I cleaned. I slept a few hours this afternoon, woke up when my mom came in, and shipped out to Grossmont to meet some buddies for "Farenheit 9/11".  The 7:30 was, of course, sold out, so we bought tickets for the 10:15 show and grabbed dinner at Chevy's Mex.  I saw some old friends, who were great fun to chill and boosted my social confidence level a bit.  The movie theater then restored most confidence in the La Mesa community- so many liberals in one place, and you know what?  I literally knew a third of them all personally, including one older cousin. Once again, Michael Moore impresses me beyond belief.  A brilliant film, if ever there was, and I attach to it a frantic thumbs up and unadulterated recommendation.  Powerful, dude.

      Christy woke me up with a phone call at about 8:15 this morning telling me to be at her house at 8:45 so we could hop of to the Cuyamaca gym.  Apart from a mini fiasco with the whole parking permit thing, everything was terrific.  Feeling the burn- oh yeah.  Now I've gotta shower and probably nap, too.  Tonight I think I'll go over to Christy's and watch season 2 of Law & Order, the original stuff with Chris Noth, Jerry Orbach, etc.  I gave it to her yesterday for her 18th. Tomorrow, Christy, Kaila, myself and Laura are all going to the Del Mar Fair.  Should kick some major apple pie and fried potato ass! Then, tomorrow night is the "Farenheit 9/11" party with Lauren, Steven, Steph, Debbie, and me @ the Hillcrest Landmark or La Jolla Village or something.  We'll have to bring signs or something. Hanging around, as you can see.  Gotta go feed the cat.

      I have rediscovered the art (art?) of blogging.  This summer lies before me like an empty stretch of sand, which I am just dying to plaster with graffiti of life and fun and laughter and love.  American University is my next step (I leave 8/17, for those of you keeping track) but I have a lot to look forward to before all that. I am making $14 an hour tutoring Bar and Bat Mitzvah students at Tifereth Israel, a miracle and a blessing despite its short duration due to my leaving in August.  Also, I'll be doing a few weeks of babysitting in the mornings for an adorable little girl for around $500.  And remember crazy Mr. Hernandez, my conservative government teacher?  I am grading papers for his summer school classes for a small fee, as well. Sam-Jon and I are over as a couple but stronger in a "Will and Grace" sort of friendship, as far as I'm concerned, without the whole gay part.  My next relationship will be with someone a little closer to my past and present, probably Jewish, maybe more dedicated to school and music.  A few people, loved ones actually, from my past have begun to haunt my memories.  I feel as though I am missing something, like I should be aware that there is someone who loves me and I someone have managed to ignore this fellow.  What could that be or mean?  I don't know.  These days, I have a bit to much time on my hands to think. I should be meeting my roommate on the phone in a few days.  All I know so far is a name, a phone number, and that she is from Austin, TX.  Whatever that means politically or culturally, next year should be quite an adventure. Whoever you are reading this lovely personal publication, please call me.  Maybe you know who the mystery lover-boy/stalker? is- haha- or maybe you are him.  We'll see.

      My alarm was correctly set to 7:12 a.m. to the tune of 760 AM, KFMB Talk Radio.&nbsp; I dragged myself out of bed and prepared for the gym.&nbsp; I was in the middle of a feverish hunt for a sweat towel when I found out that Christy, my gym buddy, would in fact not be at the gym until 9 a.m.&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; So much for changing.  I'm considering browsing online or maybe just reading  Manchurian  until I really do wakeup.&nbsp; Or there's the convention (Steven was on KUSI TV last night).&nbsp; They're up early  and  they have a time difference.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; How much Democracy can one take so early in the morn?

      God Bless "Ben & Jerry's" Cookie Dough Ice Cream!&nbsp; It's been a long week and a half- what a whirlwind vacation!&nbsp; Yosemite was awesome:&nbsp; I biked, hiked, climbed, relaxed, read, rafted, swam, flirted, got sunburned, then tanned, and generally had fun.&nbsp; The squirrels were cool, once again, but the little boogers chewed through my Bank of America bag- grrr.... I got back Sun. night really late.&nbsp; Last night I was invited to Catie's "Welcome back from France"/Birthday party.&nbsp; It was great, chatted with Kevin about band stuff and showed him some of my newest pieces; he seemed impressed, which made me feel good.&nbsp; I chilled there with pizza, salad, and soda but then felt like crap.&nbsp; I thought Sam might come over and join us or I might have spent the night, but instead I went home and ralphed... bummer. Today is all about recuperation:&nbsp; I really need a break.&nbsp; I bought the original  The Manchurian Candidate  novel, and I want to read it before I&nbsp;go see the new movie (seen the old one long ago) on Saturday.&nbsp; Speaking of which, I have tickets to M. Night Shymalan's "The Village" Friday night; call me for details.&nbsp; That guy has some real old school genius.&nbsp; You can read about his works at&nbsp; urlLink http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0796117/ . He's a young Indian director from Philadelphia known for The Sixth Sense and Signs along with a few others.&nbsp; This ought to be a great film. Off to the gym and a lesson this afternoon.&nbsp; My new notebook p.c. comes in tomorrow- yay!&nbsp; Looking forward to the last sunny San Diego days and weeks.

      The other Hill and I went to see "De-Lovely", the Cole Porter movie, yesterday, starring Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd.&nbsp; Here was my IMDB entry: &nbsp; Cole Porter was a genius.&nbsp; The 20's was an era of party, freedom, and ecstasy... but little enlightement.&nbsp; We all forget that in that time of "flapper" freedom, women barely had the right to vote, blacks in the south might as well have remained slaves, and homosexuality was often, while understatedly, considered a disease.&nbsp; Cole Porter wrote some of the most brilliant musical literature of the modern era, as directly recognized by such other shining stars as Irving Berlin and the Gershwin Brothers, some of my personal favorites.&nbsp; His personal life was beautifully intertwined with his witty and clever lyrics.&nbsp; The movie "De-Lovely" completely embodied the delightful and deep spirit of Porter, with outstanding and true-to-character performances by both Kline and Judd.&nbsp; The intensity of the cinematography and editing underscored the terrific direction and cohesiveness of the cast.&nbsp; Truly a movie for the oldest of this generation and the youngest of the past century.&nbsp; A fantastic whirlwind! &nbsp; Cliche, eh? &nbsp; I went for my physical today, just to see if my body is held together by scotch tape or wood glue before I head off to D.C.&nbsp; My favorite moment of the day:&nbsp; Nurse: "Do you take birth control?" Me:&nbsp; "No." Nurse: "Are you sexually active?" Me:&nbsp; "Uh, no.&nbsp; I thought the whole no-birth control thing kind of explained that." Nurse:&nbsp; "Oh, well then, one last question:&nbsp; is there any chance you might be pregnant?" Okay, now my two favorite jobs in the world: #1- Naming new Ice-Cream flavors for Baskin Robbins, #2 Writing questions for medical examination forms &nbsp; Also, I got two shots: Menangitis in the Rt. arm, Tetanus in the Left; don't ask me how I'm even typing.&nbsp; I think I'll just keep going until I can lift my arms again. &nbsp; Doing lots of laundry as I leave for Yosemite in 2 days.&nbsp; Gone until 7/25, folks.&nbsp; Let me know if you want a postcard or a picture of me completely sunburned.&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S. --> COMMENTS &nbsp;

      As I got bored this morning, I decided to share with my readers some interesting information on what life in AU's "dorms-like-palaces-ranked" hall next year will be like.  Next year I will be in Rm. 455 of Anderson (South) Residence Hall.  This hall is known for its Greek Chapter floors (no Greek housing in D.C.), for parties, and for frosh.  My roomie Ivana and I will be sharing a double room with private baths down the hall.  Here are some cool facts:  AU Dining Assoc. says:   "There are six residence halls on the main campus, all of which are air-conditioned and within close proximity to classrooms, dining facilities, Bender Library, the Sports Center, and the main Quad. American University recently completed a multi-million dollar residence hall renovation project, and each hall offers a variety of comforts, including television lounges, complete kitchens and laundry facilities. Every room on campus is connected to EagleNet, offering access to free e-mail, campus software packages and the internet. (Note: Ethernet cards are necessary to access EagleNet.) Every room has individually controlled air conditioning and heat, and free cable service."   Every floor in Anderson is coed... *wink* *wink*  More info to come :)

      Oops, forgot to mention that my mom went to see the great Farenheit movie last night.  Lots of passion bubble thru.  Her newest suggestion is that we take a bunch of the money from the Heinz family's outsourcing profits and donate it to a "Farenheit 9/11 Tape in Every Household" fund.  Good thinking, Mom.

      Busy few days, folks. Went to Balboa Park and swimming and the like, lots of relaxation time.  I have been desperately trying to coax the few artistic brain cells I do have to put together a scrapbook.  Yeah, right, a scrapbook.  I do have a lot of crap in a big box from the last few years.  Does that count for anything? I also put my entire schedule so-far thru December online.  Public viewing, too, which I know is weird but, hey, now no one can complain that I am just being lazy.  Just look at my calendar.  Busy ALL around. Here is a copy of an email I sent out in a liberal rage:  Dear Concerned Friends,  On July 4th, 2004, in the Tribune papers, a man named Johnny Hart published yet another "B.C." comic strip cartoon.  Many of you, as I have in the past, may enjoy his work in "B.C." and "Wizard of Id", two of his creations.  However, this particular cartoon was quite disturbing- it insinuates that eliminating "under God" while saying the pledge in school literally "destroys" the flag.  I encourage all of you to visit www.creators.com and go to the "B.C." comic strip for July 4th to view the comic, then pass this on to your friends.  In the 1990's, Johnny Hart came under great criticism for his increasingly Christian undertones and blatant religious statements in his strips.  It is time to once more recognize the subliminal messages his strip forces into the minds of America's youth, who are supposedly enjoying the humorous and careless portion on the newspaper.  It is time to stop reading hidden religious nonsense and to begin to pay attention to the REAL NEWS in the newspapers, like bloody death in war and the problems in America.  Thank you for your time and concern.  Hillary Z. Blank  --------  If you all would comment, it would be nice.  I like to hear other people type every once in awhile. :)

      Off to Balboa Park for Free Tuesday at the Natural History and Science museums.  Haven't done them for awhile; should be fun.  This afternoon, I'm going to the gym or playing tennis, one or the other.  The weekend was very fun, including an awesome 4th of July @ Sea World.  Sam came home early- I missed him.  Saw Phoebe the Cat and went to the drive-in, too. Will finish later.

      Isn't it funny that after this morning's blog about "car karma", I had 2 near auto accidents today, both probably my fault?  No, not funny at all, I agree, but still a little curious... I stopped home to change for the gym.  I'm off to Tikva's for her 5:30 lesson, then to Christy's for the gym.  She might stay the night- Debbie has requested that I bring my "funny friend who called on the cell phone" to work tomorrow so the three of us and Vanessa, a playmate of hers, can go see a movie.  Around the World in 80 days, anyone? Also, Lola is having her first official test drive by a promising buyer.  *Sniff, Sniff* I'll miss her, just not the gas prices in SD. Which reminds me- Ivana said something funny on the phone last night.  Part of a good convo:   Me:  Gosh I hate the gas prices, though.  So painful. Ivana:  Yeah, no kidding. Me:  What do you pay down there in Texas? Ivana:  A dollar seventy, something. Me: ...silence... (under my breath @$*%!!!) Ivana: What? Me:  I'm like $2.15, 2.20 if I'm lucky... Ivana: Premium?!?! Me:  I wish...  Yeah.  I'm paying for my own gas this summer, so a little part of me dies every time the dial moves down a notch on the tank meter.  The $135 paycheck I just got from TIS makes me feel a tad better, however.  Off to work and make more $$$...

      This morning I spilled coffee on myself in the car and my mom was pulled over in a speed trap.  I think putting Lola the Sentra up for sale was bad for our family's car karma. Last night I ended up going to the gym around 4- I really made the best of the workout to make up for my half-a-bagel-eating sins earlier in the day.  Christy was insisting that one of the gym employees was giving her dirty looks, but, as it turns out, the man just recognized her from a tennis class that she and her brother took last summer.  Next time we'll ask this guy to show us the ropes on the mystery circuit since we don't know how to work any of those machines.  Okay, we actually just haven't figured out how to adjust them to our dwarfish height.  That's why I always ask Christy to go ahead of me on the machine circuit, so when I get there the machine will already be adjusted. Christy and I had soup and salad @ Coco's and had to drive back to drop off a shirt for a friend, who ended up not being at Coldstone's after all.  We finally went back to her house to watch the Second Season of Law & Order but kept getting interrupted, so we went out for coffee.  The shop was closed, so we went to Blockbuster to price "50 First Dates", which was out the 15th.  It was $22, which is ridiculous compared to watch she could get on ebay in a month, so we went back to my place and started watching Rush Hour and baking a cake.  Meanwhile, my roommate finally called... It turns out Ivana is from Yugoslavia and lived in Germany a large portion of her life, and moved to TX when she was 16. She speaks several languages, likes to play the guitar, and plans to do Int'l Studies and Comm. @ AU.  She's a liberal, thank goodness- I don't know which of us was more relieved the other was a lefty.  Sounds like we have a lot in common, which is excellent.  I know that your roommate doesn't have to be your best friend, but it will be nice having a friend to "come home to" each night.  Ooo- also, she's a night owl, too, which might mean I don't have to be quiet at night. Today, I'm shopping and swimming with Debbie, then I bring my mom to pick up her car (after an oil change, 1500 miles late, great mom) and pick up Renee.  My new student Alissa will be at 3:00 @ TIS, and then I have Tikva @ her place at 5:30.  Lots of dead space, so I think I'll keep reading Conover's "Sing-Sing" book- fascinating stuff. Tonight I've got the gym again, then working on the leadership program app. for the SPA @ AU.  Tomorrow morning, more dets.

      CURRENT SONG:  Avril Lavigne -- Happy Ending, Peggy Lee-- Fever Just Kidding!  You know I would never bore my readers-- intentionally, that is.  Gosh life is boring, isn't it? AU has a chat tonight; if you're a frosh for AU next year, you really ought to sign on. Supposed to get knew glasses today; think that will happen?  I have 2 hours to do gym, chat, and whatever else.  That's all, folks. By the way, the party last night was awesome.

      Busy busy busy.  I had a terrific weekend.  Saturday my mother and I made the very exciting journey up the 5 freeway to L.A.  Oh yeah, I slept the whole way up.  The leather interior on the Acura is a godsend. Went to services, had the 5th Aliyah (friend had the 7th).  It was wonderful to see him again; I really miss being around him during the summer. Jillian picked me up in Newhall in the afternoon.  We went to Macaroni Grill (yummy) and shopping @ the Northridge mall where I bought a nice gray and purple striped knit tee.  So nice, out of character, but nice. Sunday was the AU meet-and-greet.  I was the only student there (others already there) but lots of cool alumni.  In fact, the guy who founded AU's Hillel was there.  He had amazing stories about formal dinners with Dr. Anderson, the namesake of my residence hall. Today I did things I was supposed to do (I slept for 12 hours, for goodness sake) and then finally made it over to my aunt's house (house-sitting for 4 days).  Going to Manchurian with Brad tonight @ the free theater- fun fun.  Back to a quiet house for the night... not bad.
