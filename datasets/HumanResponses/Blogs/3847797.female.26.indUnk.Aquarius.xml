      My 9 month old baby daughter, Eliana aka Ellie, woke me up at 4:00 this morning!  Not to mention she also woke up around 11 from what I think was a nightmare.  The poor thing was inconsolable!  I'm going to go to bed soon.  I want to read some more of the Bringing Down the House book.  It is really starting to pick up now and get exciting.  Then I'll finish Second Glance.  I'm trying to decide what to take to the beach at the end of the month.  You know I'll probably take 5-10 books...and I'll be lucky to finish 1!  But I can't wait until we go.  Only 11 more working days!

      in the neighborhood.  96, not a cloud in the sky or a breath of wind.  It's HOT!  I found a great recipe I want to try:  Beef Stroganoff:  Amount Measure Ingredient -- Preparation Method -------- ------------ -------------------------------- 1/4 cup flour 1 lb stew meat ½ stick butter 1 onion Mushrooms 2 cubes beef bullion 2 cups water 1 pint sour cream Garlic Salt Pepper  Put steaks in a bag with garlic salt, pepper and flour,  shake to fully cover meat.   In a skillet place a ½ stick of butter and let it melt. Dump  onion and mushrooms into skillet with meat and brown veggies  and meat. Add the 2 cubes of bullion and water to skillet, and stir until mixture boils.   Cover and simmer for half an hour, checking on it every  once in awhile. After a half an hour add the 1 pint of sour  cream a little bit at a time. Mix in thoroughly, and allow to  reheat. Pour over rice.   NOTES : Freeze this WITHOUT the rice/noodles - then the  nite you want to make it make the rice/noodles FRESH!  Doesn't that sound yummy!  I'm still plugging away at Bringing Down the House. It's moving along pretty well and I'm still pretty interested...but my eye keeps  wandering over to other books I'm dying to read.  I hope I finish it!  H~

      I wish I was independently wealthy.    I hate short weeks.  It just makes the week feel  longer  to me.  Work is soooo boring today because there is absolutely NOTHING to do!  I'm reading a pretty interesting book right now.  It's called  Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions  by Ben Mezrich.  I'm not very far into it yet, but it reads rather like a novel.  I would say I'm probably hooked on it now.  I tried 2 or 3 other books before this one stuck.  I think I needed a bit of non-fiction after reading  The Confessions of Max Tivoli  by Andrew Sean Greer.  Very sad, depressing book.  Don't get me wrong though, I really enjoyed it.  It was very...different.
