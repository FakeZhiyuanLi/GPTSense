       Yeah Today's Justin's birthday. He turned 16. Somehow I feel weirder around him. Not really just him it's just that, people think that it was okay for us to go out when he was 15 but no 16. And my birthday is exactly one month away so i don't even know why it would matter.Kind of makes me mad. Hmmm....I don't care. I love him to death and a stupid thing like age er something won't stop me. Anyway, gave him 20 bucks and sent him on his way. With his bestfriend matt. off to find some jack. If only........ Peace Love Unity,Karina xoxo

       Yeah this is a song that I wrote just because it's true and ironic. And I hope that you like it and if you do like it please don't copy it.    Don't think about it. -Karina Baylocq  It's not always better to love than Lost. It's not always better to kiss than tell. it's not always the same the second time around. Sometimes things can be ironic.--   Every love must be lost Every Rose has it's thorn Every Hero has their fears Every Saint has their tears Everything good must come to an end.  It's hard to think that every daughter is gunna have sex It's hard to think that every son will obsess about sex It's hard to think that every pet dies It's hard to think that your children lie.   Every trust must be lost Every Rose has it's thorn Every Hero Has their fears Every mother has her tears Everything good comes to an end. Sometimes it's better to deny   Deny that some day the world will end Deny that we are creating our own deaths Deny that we aren't free That our rights they'll keep   Every love must be lost Every Rose has it's thorn Every Hero has their fears Every Saint has their tears Everything good must come to an end.  &nbsp;  Peace, Love,&nbsp;and Unity ~Karina  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Jesus Christ Brothers Suck Ass. Man I hate my Brother most of the time. Fucking Fat Fuck. All he wants to do is talk to his one chick friend named Amber all the time because he thinks that she is hot. And he thinks that he actually has a chance with her. And him and his friend Chad always argue about who would have a chance with her and truthfully they both don't. Not saying that Amber is some incredibly hot woman or anything in fact i think she is pretty average. But they are fucking ugly it's sad. Amd it's not really like you can feel sorry for them because they are both really fat so it's self infelected I mean I watch what i eat for a reason. And they don't so why should they be able to get girlfriends when they don't even try and I fucking have to worry about what the fuck i eat? That's not fair in my opion. Fucking Fatasses. ~*Karina xoxo

      &nbsp;Well Let's see how these days have gone since the 12th. Ummm....I'm absolutely conviced that Justin and Chantel (my boyfriend and bestfriend) have a thing for each other. I mean she flirts with him&nbsp;more than I do. Which is really sad. But I don't wanna think that my bestfriend and The Love of my Teenage Life have a thing for each other because I would just be heartbroken. But I know that they both really don't wanna hurt me. So I'm gunna try not to worry but it still bugs me TRUTHFULLY. What also bugs me is that&nbsp;I love being with Justin alone without anyone around because it's just nice. But when someone else is around it's just not fun and I feel violated when they watch us when we are laying on the grass with each other. It's freakin annoying. But I guess it's mostly with Chantel because no matter how many hints I drop she just won't go AWAY! But I can't just full out tell her I want her to go because that would be not being a good friend. But I seriously hate it when she is around when Justin and I wanna be alone. But I mean what Can I do? SERIOUSLY. nothing. But whatever Chantel is way worth more than any guy so I should be a good friend to her. So I love Chantel and Justin. and I hope I don't lose either of them. and I really hope that I'm parnoid about then liking each other. Love. Karina xoxo

      So yeah nothing much has been happening lately. Nothing much with Justin and Mine relationship either. Some Days I could never picture us being apart or not being together. Some days I could. But I love Justin so if anything it's gunna be my fault that we split up.  SO Chantel got off grounding today but we couldn't do anything because no one would give me a ride. Every one was like I'm too tired. It's like how fucking hard is it to get in your car and drive 15 mins. 15 mins isn't that long! it's like what are you challenged at driving or something! if so hand over your keys! damn! well anyway I love Justin and that's all I have to say Karina

      Jesus Christ. Alright I guess I'll start from yesterday, okay yesterday I went down to the river again with Justin and hung out with Reno S.C.U.M. and Reno River Kids. So then Austin ivites all of us to go play pool so some of us went. But then Justin, Peter, and I decided to go back to the River instead. But when we got there every one was leaving to go drink beer and smoke crack. I thought they were kidding but later i found out that they weren't.  So I went to a show at the bowling alley right across the street from City Centers because the guy that sells Hot Dogs in the park promised that if Josh (reno scum) got everyone to come to his show he would give him free hotdogs all the time. So yeah that was fun.   So last night I had this dream. It was kind of weird. BEcause earlier before I went to bed I was talking to Julian about what would make me so sad it would bring me to Suicide. So I only named two things. Him killing himself and Justin breaking my heart. And then in my dream both of those things happened. Me and Justin were just in the park and he just broke up with me for no reason at all. And we were sitting on a bench and it was just a shock to me. And then he just left to go play catch with Reno River Kids. I was so sad and alone.  Then the next day, it was like at school and I was walking looking at the ground and I looked up and I saw Justin looking at me with a pity kind of look combined with sadness. So I hugged him. So tightly and in my dream I never wanted to let go but he pulled away. Then my other friend Rachel came and talked to me when Justin was somewhere else, and she said that she said that she knew that me and Justin broke up cause he told her he was gunna do it because he liked her. And then so casually she mentioned that Julian killed himself too. I was crushed. I was so sad. I prayed that it was a dream and thankfully it was. But I couldn't wake up. I just couldn't wake up. And I got this feeling in my stomach when i was about to open my eyes that if i saw the same thing I knew it wasn;t a dream but I saw my bedpost. I was so reliefed. I was so sad I started to cry right when I woke up. I never want that dream to come true.

      *~*~*Sarah*~*~*  My name is Sarah   I am but three,   My eyes are swollen   I cannot see,   I must be stupid   I must be bad,   What else could have made   My daddy so mad?   I wish I were better   I wish I weren't ugly,   Then maybe my mommy   Would still want to hug me.   I can't speak at all   I can't do a wrong   Or else I'm locked up   All the day long.   When I awake I'm all alone   The house is dark   My folks aren't home   When my mommy does come   I'll try and be nice,   So maybe I'll get just   One whipping tonight.   Don't make a sound!   I just heard a car   My daddy is back   From Charlie's Bar.   I hear him curse   My name he calls   I press myself   Against the wall   I try and hide   From his evil eyes   I'm so afraid now   I'm starting to cry   He finds me weeping   He shouts ugly words,   He says its my fault   That he suffers at work.   He slaps me and hits me   And yells at me more,   I finally get free   And I run for the door.   He's already locked it   And I start to bawl,   He takes me and throws me   Against the hard wall.   I fall to the floor   With my bones nearly broken,   And my daddy continues   With more bad words spoken.   "I'm sorry!", I scream   But its now much too late   His face has been twisted   Into unimaginable hate   The hurt and the pain   Again and again   Oh please God, have mercy!   Oh please let it end!   And he finally stops   And heads for the door,   While I lay there motionless   Sprawled on the floor   My name is Sarah   And I am but three,   Tonight my daddy   Murdered me.   There are thousands of kids out there just like Sarah. And you can help.   Please pass this poem on because as crazy as it might sound, it might just indirectly change a life. Hey, you NEVER know. Please put this in your diary, if you are *AGAINST CHILD ABUSE*  That is such a sad poem... poor little kid.  Pass it on guys.

      If I was rich....  I would walk around in public with a "Fuck Me Im Rich"  T-Shirt. Not made yet? thats ok ill invent it and get even more money.  I would hire people to laugh at my jokes.  I would slap a poor man just for the hell of it.  I would walk around in a mall and hand out a 20 dollar bill to a random person and point to a non existing camera somewhere and say "we'll be right back after these messages"  I would make clothes out of shredded dollar bills.  I would hire a black guy to say your rich bitch everytime i leave my house.  I would rig my front door to shoot shredded money at me everytime i walked into my house.  Then i would make a minority clean it up.  I would put a white guy, a jew, a mexican, a nigger, an italian, a cuban, and a chink in a room and put cameras in there so i can watch The Real World whenever i want.  I would go to the bathroom and miss on purpose and hire a minority to clean it up.  I would make an actual public bathroom with the urinals and stalls and on the front door where the Mens sign goes and put a "Little Tykes Room" sign. Just for the hell of it!  Then i would invite Michael Jackson over and see how fast he ran to the door.  I would hire an old lady to run around in public and fake a heart attack.  I would buy a Winnie the Pooh costume and go crap in someones front lawn so that the lady in the house runs to her husband and says "Hunny Pooh just took a Poo in our front lawn" and they will both run to the window and ill be gone so the husband will say "Your a crazy ass bitch i should have listened to my mother!"  Hahaha I love that. Yeah some really cool dude wrote all of that. So yeah Nothing Special about today. I got trippy nails (that press on crap) I made Half Black and Half White pants. Uh I saw Aaron Corpus and Travis Johnson on the news. I saw Joe from the spacement at Albertsons. that's it.
