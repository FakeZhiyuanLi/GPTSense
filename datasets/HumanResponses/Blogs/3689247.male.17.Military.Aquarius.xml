      well hello its that time the time of cram, I hate it this week is the worst, got the worst test's ahead, this is where the real cramming comes into effect it is time for chem., I studied all day today went outside grabbed a coolata first(caramel swirl is THE best) then I did the old regents' and surprisingly did somewhat well.  Of course I got distracted.  One time there was a bee that was dying and kept on fluttering and spazing out on the floor and I got scared it was just pretending and the second it came to close BAM it would attack me.  Then I moved and there was another bee this time it was flying so I ran away and went to the other benches.  The I sat down and decided it was too cold in the shade, so I went to the sun.  The sun was in my eyes so I moved again.  I went back to the shade and then pretty soon someone started BQ ing so I started to think about food.  Then a lady comes up to me and tells me to not to forget to throw out my cup when I was done, this reminded me of prep so I wanted to hit her with a large hammer but I forgot it at home. ok now two days and the hell begins.....math...tomorrow I have a review class and at least Christina will be there to keep me from utter boredom and despair, then next day ill fail the math b and study some MORE chem.  The fun never stops....never..... Oh and UPDATE on band...we have a drummer now and I’m working on a link for our songs.....all lyrics and poems are the sole rights of Theresa Heller records **little c thingy**.---END

      The sex pistols are great, im dedicated to listen to them enough so develope a britsh accent.   And now a question for those who read to entertain in thier silly minds.&nbsp;  Has anyone ever took a step back and thought about all the people who have problems, i mean the basic teen problems, and thought to themselves that most of them are the same?&nbsp; Yes im sure most of u have...but then has anyone ever stood back for a moment and ever tried to see the reason as to why these problems develope? Well of course we can not fathom this since most people are different and none can ever see the full picture...but.&nbsp; Is anyone sick of the hate that develops in our lives...the hate between people, the quest to be cool or the quest to be happy ussually ends in some one loosing...and another question...has anyone ever tried to help or care outside of talking to them online?...i was just wondering if i was the only person who had these questions, i feel like the only one who thinks of this stuff.&nbsp; Oh well just a thought   Anywho im hoping next year will be flled with meeting new freinds and new exctiing thigs happen.&nbsp; Oh and on an awesome note i might get into  NROTC,  which means i can go to college for four years and THEN be a navy officer and begin my piolot career sooner, as well as be a IT guy ( information systems technician , basically otherwise known as computer technician)&nbsp; thats the job i picked today.&nbsp; I begin basic   July 21st   so its less than a year then the fun begins...im so happy im on the road to living my dream already.&nbsp; Yes today was a busy busy day...tommrow i shall try to relax finnaly...hmm i still need to go to lake george i still have alot of thinking to accomlish and i cant do it with Mrs. Nagy Mcnagyson here. Well thats all for now..oh and i had an interesing time testerday....hmm i have to think about it but it seems interesting as of yet,but u know how things change.

      Every day I feel like im loosing my edge...Like a giant sword is cutting my existence into two part then tiny people are building an indestructible wall.&nbsp; I have forgotten some things, some things that used to be part of my life, some things that made me who I am.&nbsp; I am less caring as the days go by and by whose hand is this fate brought by?&nbsp; The hand is my own, when I wake up tomorrow, none of this will matter.&nbsp; Life is just a dying and birth, that repeats everyday.&nbsp; We all go to bed with some sort of accomplishments in our hands, some sort of structure we have built inside ourselves, and the next day is just a clean slate that we can eat off of, a clean slate indeed.&nbsp; The same mundane thing every damn day, all hoping that one day, we will wake up and finally be the person we have been meaning to be all along, but of course we fall asleep not thinking of this, wake up like everyday ready to make that clean slate into something great and add it to the giant library of our lives.&nbsp; I say I am going to finally stop drawing on little slates, I wish to make a mural that will stare me in the face each day I awake.&nbsp; Now is the time to act.&nbsp; tomorrow starts the first day, in which I will become who I want to be, I will stop holding back, being the same damn rich everyone knows and expects to be...clothes do not make me, music does not make me, friends do not make me, where I live and what I do do not make me, but every single moment does.....For now every single moment is who I will be, I am now I am not tomorrow, I am here I am not there, what comes doesn't matter.

      I shall arrive in jersey, but tognight I have to finalize everything.  I have to get someone  to cover for me at work...so nikki if ure reading this and I haven't contacted you then give me a ring cause ill get u out of Saturday morning work..ok? Alright I have that to do then call Theresa and see if she can pick me up from the train station...sorry if im being such a pain but I have to do this now or else i will die from not seeing you.  But what sucks about that is i cant go to lake george from thier cause thiers not enoguh room in the car so ill have to go back to penn and take the train to lake george....and they said that vacations were stress free, bull.  Ok when that is all complete i have three problems to take care of...the navy crap, then the girl crap, wait dont care anyome so that is never going to go anywhere cause i give up on it indefinately now.  Then i can completely relax ....and that will give me about a week of mental relaxation.  Mark my words, next year i will be so far from caring and interacting that some people will forget i exist, so that means take care for some.  A aggressive statement, yes but something has to change, Im being too drained.  Well thats my curent state at the moment, im free to hang monday and tuesday of next week so drop a line.  -rich

      ahhhh so yesterday had the greatest time with my buds chritine and jess two of my most awesome friends that i havnt seen in months and was dying to see, got my nails painted green and black by christine and raided thier friends house and ate sausage cheese and crakers and listend to jess' fav band "folly".  Then day before was band practice  which was absolutely awesome, we accomplished the song "got no" I am so proud of myself and ryan for pulling it together it is truly the best we have done sofar. Then we were messing around and since nikki was recording our entire pratice and ryan was trying out some new stuff on his guitar without the distortions (which made it sound emoish) i just started pulling words out of my asss like stuff that would be in an emo song and itcame out with my lemonade leaving me and i dont know why, great stuff very funny.  Ryan was shocked how good it sounded for me just pulling words out of my ass seriously u should have seen his face, and nikki couldnt stop laughing.  well we have it on tape if ya like to take a looksies.  Now today i have work, tommorow im going to the hilton hotel till friday curtysey of the navy for a medical checkup.  Then sat to sunday possible lan party IF steve asks, well he better.  then from there on out its anyones guess....oh and about warped...yes well ill go for like the three bands i want to see(if only punks vs phsycos tour came here), ya a waste of money but whatever.  BUT i have to decide either NY or NJ one cause i want ta go with my friend Theresa cause shes uber cool andlives in NJ and if u have a reason otherwise why i should go to NY's dont be a startnger and drop a note alrighty kids im done

      ahh the days of summer endless gaming, sleeping going online watching conan, drinking tons of soada, not having to step outside exceptfor the occasional Mcdonals, which they made easier cause now they have debit machines. Hangign out once in awile with people who dont annoy the heck out of me....ahhh.  the only thing that would make this better is if my aunt wasnt here cause then she wouldnt be here to tell me to get off the computer cuase id still be on it (my main gaming computer not the laptop im on now for clarrification) now if it wasnt for that...yes. oh and ONCE and only ONCE we have to plan some sort of lan part/movie party...or guys we can just mush it together as in we have it but then me rob ed and steve just stay when everyone else leaves...HA! its genious!!!!!

Not in a selfish way but in a sympathetic way....if i were u id never talk to me again, but somethings cant be solved only ignored until it festers and it annoys u until u dont care anymore but alot comes at that price....too much, and it isnt worth it.  if ure wondering what the hell im babling about, i dont really know im just writing without thinking.

      Okee the 4th has arisen from the shit that it once has fallen in(dont think too much about that statement) ANYWHOO  hmm today twas interesting folks, i had the apointment with a navy recruter dude.  It was an enlightening expirience, first off i couldnt even find the place i got off at the wrong stop only o realize i have to walk a dozen blocks to get there, it was nice to be stared at by a bunch of illegals waiting for work at every corner..psh...flushing.  Then i found the place sat down with one of the officers and he told me stuff then he let me take a test which related to a fourth graders test, except for the parts where they ask u to find the square root of a number to the nearest tenth and all the options have decimals in it u just kinda end up  squaring all the options to see which one is correct, which is annoying.  Then he asked me questions such as what is my life goal, lie where do  see myself in 4 years....and im thinking i dont know what im going to do tommorow how would i kow that so all i answered him was, flying jets and working on computer systems.  Then he went on to talk about how when u get out of college jobs are looking for really qualified individuals or someone with a lot of expirience which college alone doesnt offer, which is true.  With the NROTC program i could just specialize in an exact field of work...which translates into job training right away which furthurmore translates into getting paid which further translates into i will have alota mula quicker.  And the navy pays for EVERYTHING which is extreamly awesome, he told me free housing, free car, no or reduced taxes, all in return for some  service which i dont mind.  And after four years i can petition for officer training and once that is complete i can fly jet planes and bombers.  He also showed me all the things he has become certifed for which closly resembles the profession trees in SWG, which is also similar becuase u can train for whaever u want at anytime, all u have to do is ask and he said u learn by expirience...like say u want to learn to be a helmsman the captain puts u in the contol and guides u, and u do that eseveral times and he certifies u, its like gaining expirience points. So it sounds awesome and ill investigate furthure i guess and if all this hold true say goodbye to applying to colleges cause he said if u are willing to follow through thier is no need to appy to college cause u get specialized job training at the college of ure choice for free anyway and the navy handles all the paper work. Exciting.  So thats what i learned today.  Ok see ya kids on the 4th later

      US Marine Corps Rules for Gunfights 1. Be courteous to everyone, friendly to no one. 2. Decide to be aggressive ENOUGH, quickly ENOUGH. 3. Have a plan. 4. Have a back-up plan, because the first one probably won't work. 5. Be polite. Be professional. But, have a plan to kill everyone you meet. 6. Do not attend a gunfight with a handgun whose caliber does not start with a "4." 7. Anything worth shooting is worth shooting twice. Ammo is cheap. Life is expensive. 8. Move away from your attacker. Distance is your friend. (Lateral & diagonal preferred.) 9. Use cover or concealment as much as possible. 10. Flank your adversary when possible. Protect yours. 11. Always cheat; always win. The only unfair fight is the one you lose. 12. In ten years, nobody will remember the caliber, stance, or tactics. They will remember who lived. 13. If you are not shooting, you should be communicating.  Navy SEALS Rules For Gunfights 1. Look very cool in sunglasses. 2. Kill every living thing within view. 3.

Yesterday i went to Tashias house and saw Goldeneye, again..yes i know BUT she never saw it..can u believe it? Yes well i made her watch it to save her life, then we watched Donnie Darko, a strange movie indeed but very great as well...i still dont understand it but with furthur annalasis im sure ill figure it out.  So bassically everysummer day ive been on the computer...and for some reason im not gaming that much, but today i shall try, but it seems everytime i do my aunt seems to yell at me, so its much easier to just be in my room, i cant explain it.  As for anymore activities this summer, thiers going to the beach and work and navy stuff, which by the way im now officially sighned up for, and then hiers lae george next week and other various stuff.  A interesting summer indeed....and now for a pic of me at Natasias house   and now a pic of her
