      My Skin Hates Me Of course and as usual, my skin clears up when I have an appt. with the derm. Never when I have to attend a wedding with an ex who's bringing his new 6 foot tall blonde girlfriend who looks like she does a little modeling for Neutrogena on the side (when she's not busy with her extremely influential and high paying job).   I'm going to have to beg for the Accutane again. I had an appt. with another derm about 6 months ago...a week before I saw him I looked like I had dipped my face in battery acid. The day of the appt. I woke up with the clearest skin I had ever had. It was insane. So, of course he won't give the 'tane. Gives me some of that topical crap that does absolutely nothing but make my gross zits itch, which is sweet. Because having big gross zits doesn't suck enough...lets see if we can make them itch too. AHHHH!If he had given it to me I would be done by now.   But no...here I am, waiting for a derm appt. and watching my skin get clearer by the second. It's bad when you hope the zits stay long enough so the&nbsp;Dr. doesn't think you're nuts. I'm wondering if I should just keep making appointments and then my skin will stay clear......

      I am just wondering about my HTML skills and want to see if this will work. I am starting Accutane next week and have been inspired by the journals that other have kept. It looks like a long and slightly scary road- but one that promises results (something&nbsp;I have all but given up on). I will be posting a history next week (since my life long battle with cystic acne must be deeply interesting to the world on the&nbsp;web....). My gut says that no one will even see this journal, but it feels good to just get this stuff off my chest (and forehead, and chin, and back haha).

      OK...so I started the pills. Wow! People were right..those suckers are hard to open. They gave me the generic (Amnesteem) at 20 MG a day. They say take with food, so I've been taking it with dinner. Here's the round up:  Day 1 Took first pill and waited to lightning to strike. I'm a little dramatic so of course I started to itch right away. As a result of a nice tan and the cortisone shot I got last week at the derm, the skin is looking better than it has in a long time. No real symptoms yet.  Day 2 Had a few (maybe a few more than a few) drinks, figured there the stuff wasn't really in my system just yet. No real bad effects. Small hangover, but I think not an outstanding one. We'll see how that continues.  Day 3 Uneventful.  Day 4 Took in the evening with food. This is the first time I got a little bit of a stomach ache. Not sure if it was a back-to-work Sunday gernic malise, but I defnitely felt a little funny. The dry lips and itchy skin has started. I guess the fun begins here. I've been slathering myself with Aveeno and Aqaphor. My scalp is a little itchy too- might be time to switch from the oily hair shampoo to the mouturizing one. Who-hoo. One small step for man, one giant leap for an oily haired girl!  More later.

      Okay- so that fear about having skin too clear for the Doctor...no way. The day before the appointment I developed a cyst on my forehead about the diameter of a silver dollar that extended about a half inch from the skin. Good times, good times. On a positive note, the doctor took one look at me and said the words I've been waiting to hear: Accutane.  They did the blood work and since there's no chance of me being knocked up, (acne is its own special kind of birth control haha) I was told I could start right away. He did the usual warnings, no sun, waxing, if I feel like I want to kill myself let him know. And that was it. He injected the medical monstrosity on my forehead. I've read a ton of other journals that say they hate the cortisone shots.....me, I love them. What would have taken three weeks to go away is gone in less than 24 hours. Three seconds of intense pain beats the hell out of needing to wear a Burka for a week.  Also, the Derm said he was starting me at a baby dose (20 Mg once a day) and that meant I wouldn't get the initial breakout. He also said I can continue to drink socially (which I enjoy very much) until he says differently. I sincerely hope that both of these things are true.  So I filled the script and went and stocked up on supplies. The other journals I've read were invaluable as far as this goes so, just in case anyone ever ends up reading this thing I'll be pretty specific about which products I'm using and how well they work. I bought: Aquaphor for the lips- Iâ€™m a chapstick addict anyway, so I already love this stuff. Aveeno- Intense Hand Relief Cream; Aveeno Intense Relief Moisturizer; Aveeno Intense Body Wash. If you can't already tell, I like the Aveeno stuff. I'm sticking to my regular shampoo for now, since it's for oily hair which I think will take a little while to stop. Face wash is some fancy shit I got from a Derm at a chi-chi spa in Soho called Gly-Sal. There is also a moisturizer, but I can't remember the name. I think I will end up switching to the Cetophil stuff since everyone rave about it- but, since I paid $45.00 for the crap I have I'll just finish it off.  So I'm stocked up and ready to go. .....and it begins.
