      reached school at 0900 again =( maths was quite boring as i could see some kids yawnings.there were some boys who were making a fool of themselves in class...hai~~luckily my friend bought lunch for me =) but i no appetite to eat.only got an hour break before lesson started.p1 kids were so hyperactive during music lesson....oh my,30mins with them seemed like an hour.for english lesson i showed them the trailer for TROY and managed to complete 2 pages of the workbook.hai~~then came the boring part of marking their work.....ARghhhh,some were okay,some were barely ok.shit.got to go through the corrections with them.maybe will ask them to do that during the social studies period.brought home one big stack of worksheets to mark.the worst thing was that halfway through marking,there was a blackout.heng left with just stamping the dates on the paper hahaha.or else i could have gone to sleep.  today will be a rush-rush day.no breaks at all from 10-1530.shit right.very nice to float meh???

      well,first day of school was abit chaotic.took a cab cause carrying alot of stuffs.reached school around 0900,then my collegues commented 'wah,how come you are here so early?i haven't even go for my first lesson yet!'then went through a hectic morning checking schedules for the supp lessons,cca time and day..blah blah blah..went for my first lesson at 1200.the kids are generally ok.told them about my expectations and explained the class rules.taught abit of volume.got to remember to dismiss them earlier,after which i rushed up to the hall for assembly.felt quite sad as the newbies are not introduced to the school.felt so good when one of my collegue lent my the sitting arrangment for my p5 class.my p5 class is cute (generally).the class comp connection is v slow.....die man...like that how to show them the trailer of "troy"? must access the shared folder thing today.then maybe can upload all the powerpoint stuffs to the folder.the last lesson of the day was supp.i ONLY KNOW OF THE SUPP ON THE DAY ITSELF...shitty right?or else i could have left school at 1430.with the supp on,i left school at around 1530.there was a crash of supp and my timetable,therefore got to change the supp to tuesday 1430-1530.die.like that from next week onwards,i don't have a break from 1200 all the way to 1700!there is CCA at 0830 on monday =( meeting at 1000 this friday,which means that i will be in school from 1000 till 1830 on friday.....sure die one....will be zombilised by then.  today will be my first music lesson.haven't get any materials yet.my social studies' materials are also not in.die man.how to teach?they are so inefficient.  oh one good stuff that happened yesterday was that i managed to get the hamtaro tag.no choice,cause i didn't want the hello kitty or the ultra man one.only $2!!!!!

       the sounds of heavy machines drilling and hacking the tiles away really get on my nerves.my baby must had been very tired to sleep through all these.not to mention that every part of the house is covered with a layer of dust and tiny-weeny particles.the cleaning up is much,much more pleasant than hearing all those noise.  right now,the funeral thingy is going on at the void deck...tong tong chang,tong tong tong tong chang~~~so noisy *cover ears* hope today will be the last day.   had 2 dreams.the first one took place in ancient china.both the emperor and 1 other very powerful man was in love with me(muahaha).then the 3 of us drove around the palace in a cabstar van!the powerful man was 'there-ing' me,while i rested my head on the emperor's shoulder.haha..but the dream ended here.the second dream was made me quite upset.i dreamt that i called my baby but his female,chinese sgt answered the phone.i asked her where my baby was but she refused to tell me.i got so mad at her,i started to yelled at her before hanging up the phone.i called until my baby answered.he was actually mad at me for yelling at her.stupid shit right?the scene changed to a stadium,where the people were having some sports day thingy.hai~~~i don't really like to dream.all my dreams were either scary or weird.i don't like my dreams to end halfway,i would be left thinking about the ending for quite sometime.i tried going back to my dreams,but i only managed to go back once.

      weee.....saturday is finally here,can meet my baby longer.there's 1 big problem on weekend though,everytime we planned to go somewhere or do something...we are most likely to nuah at home,sleep,wake up and eat.haha,we are like pigs,very lazy.sometimes i got my own plans,but my baby wants to go down to his friend's shop or to the aquarium (-_-) the look on my face tells you everything.later he suggests to go to macpherson to a electronic warehouse sales,he wants to look for the $159 tv there.then maybe it's back to the shop to collect his minis.*yawns* sometimes it's boring to go these places,but i'm fine with it.i love to accompany him go anywhere.looking forward to next sat,we'll be having dinner with toshiba and her bf,maybe can do some window shopping or real shopping before that.  i'm still left with 3 weeks of holidays.i haven't touch the stuffs in my bag yet.will probably start reading next tuesday??then tomorrow will be busy cleaning my pig's cage and bathing them.will likely to clear my room again(although according to someone,my room still looks the same before and after clearing).

        PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.  PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!!

      i don't understand the definition of nagging.does it means talking too much,talking endlessly or talking endlessly and making a big fuss to get a small job done? i don't understand why people need to nag?are they too lonely or they are attention seekers? naggers usually have a poor command of language,so poor that the words they used for nagging can be recorded and complied into a piece of A4 size paper(written on both side).what is the point of nagging when you jolly know that the person will not change or do the things according to the 'specific instructions'? but my occupation requires me to nag...hai~~what am i suppose to do?if i don't nag i get arrows shooting or aiming at various angles.so poor thing =(  school's going to start soon.i'm sooo 'excited'.i think i will be ultra busy.die,hope that i can handle all the stress and workload.oh and i get to meet the young and old naggers again =)

      argh,have been ultra busy these few weeks.trying to adapt to everything that they've got in store for me.one small molehill of things to mark(compared to my neighbour).going to have racial harmony day celebration later...wondering how much time it will be taken away from my lessons(hopefully i don't get to see some kids today,I don't mind).watched The Dreamers last night,the siamese twins' behaviour was weird.....luckily i don't have another twin....eeeeeeeeeee *hair standing up* but the guy who played matthew was a poor chap.he loved isabelle so much,yet the girl chose to go with her siamese brother.*shaking head* but there were snippets of black and white movies inserted in the film,nice,i like that. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      managed to watch Spiderman that day.the 2 happy days were over,so fast.is it my fault that we could not meet up everyday?i am starting to hate my job.it is an obstruction.job=very busy + tired = no time to meet.but then i am trying hard to finish all my work within that day.i have no time for break.my breaks are for me to catch up with my work.no break = no/little food + less work accumulated = more time to meet.sometimes you don't understand the nature of my job.you whine about not spending enough time with you.besides working,all my free time is spent with you.what more do you want?i'm trying hard to make you happy,but you seem to be very hard to satisfy.i feel that i'm always in the wrong.i'm the one who is always doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.   i hope to fall sick soon...i feel SO SHITTY

        after watching the house of the flying daggers..i realised some stuffs          1. kung fu movie confirm will have a fighting scene in the forest full of b    amboo     shoots          2. there are no good or bad guys.you can be half good half bad-depends on      the situation          3. 2 guys must always fall in love with the same girl          4. the girl is not already what the guys perceive her to be          5. those people that you think should be killed will most likely survive till the      end of the show          6. the great hero must die,or else he's not considered a hero          7. chinese bamboo is strong          8. the fighting scene can last for a long time until the snow falls          9. the guys must always have long hair,so they will look better when snow      or leaves got stuck in the hair          10. they must roll in the grass while making out               10 commandments of the art of kung fu shows          1. Thou shall see weapons of all sorts being thrown into the air          2. Thou shall not complain when i see them fight for the (x)th time in the      bamboo forest          3. Thou shall not comment on their hairstyle          4. Thou shall not trust women,most likely they will turn against you          5. Thou shall not trust my best friend,most likely he is a mole          6. Thou shall see acts more interesting that the moscow circus          7. Thou shall not waste precious time trying to guess the ending,most shows      end the same way          8. Thou shall not tell my friends the plot,let them waste $ to watch the stupid      show (i was cheated of my $,so should they)          9. Thou shall master at least 1 kind of weapon,in case of emergency          10. Thou shall go to exotic place like Ukraine for honeymoon.the scenery is a      killer man
