      - My work schedule sucks. I have to do the Pacer game tonight which starts at 8:30 and I won't be done until after 1:00 if I'm lucky. Then I have to be at work tomorrow morning at 8:00. If I said that to anyone at work, all they would tell me is "You now officially work at a radio station." To make matters worse, it's snowing and I lack major confidence that my car will survive the winter much less this weekend. Yay work!  -Due to my large amount of free time before the game, I suddenly made up my personal top 5 Madonna songs. Now, I'm not even a fan much less own any of her CDs but here it goes.     (honorable mentions: Justify My Love, Material Girl, I Want You w/Massive Attack and Borderline)           5. Don't Tell Me- The best tune never to be played at your local American Eagle.   4. Express Yourself- this song just screams diva   3. Dress You Up- I think the hook itself just does it for me, Gap commercial be damned   2. Like A Prayer- one day in H.S. I started to sing this song in one class which prompted much looks from people. And I haven't even listened to it in years. The power of Madonna compells you!   1. Lucky Star- Just a great pop song with a killer 80s beat. Still holds up after all these years.    So basically, her early stuff rocked and despite that brief revival she sucks now. Then again I always hated the chick.

      -I just finished my finals and I'm somewhat relieved. Friday night I covered a crap-tacular game where YOUR Indiana Pacers (in retro unis) took on the Atlanta Hawks (in neon green retro unis, yuck). It was neat checking out some behind the scene stuff (media room with quite of spread...of food) and coverage of the game overall. We sat up higher than the established sports guys but it was still a nice view. It became difficult keeping track with the way our Sports writing professor showed us how to but I got used to it and I had pages of notes by the end. The post game press conference was neat as coach Carlisle came out and saw the entire class sitting in one row while the rest of the sports guys were scattered about. The coach's first words were, in fact, "Is this a class?" Heck, one of use had Rick the nerve to ask him a question (a stupid one I might add). Overall, it was a fun experience that was as memorable when we covered an IU football game in Bloomington. Unfortunately, I turned in a crappy article to my professor by our 1:00 AM deadline so I'll be lucky to get a B. It was stressful but moments like this are why I'll miss college. The whole camaraderie of classmates and doing fun stuff that you never get the opportunity to do in regular life.   -Today was my Comics in American Culture final and that was interesting. I had to get a 5-page paper about the analysis of the graphic novel of our choice. I picked "Watchmen" and needless to say, trying to stretch out 5 pages on why a certain comic was appealing to you is difficult. But I did it and was 20 minutes late to the final. I think I did ok but the class left a bad taste in my mouth with the reason being it was a TV class. One reason is that it's easy to put a TV lecture class on the bottom of your priorities. I think I watched 4 hours of lectures two days before the final and I swear I thought I developed carpal tunnel syndrome. The other reason is that I would have like to have had some type of classroom atmosphere and some feed back from the professor. He kind of came across as being a real ass. But that's an English professor for you.   -I forgot to mention that Marcia Gay Harden's character in "Mona Lisa Smile" looked exactly like "The Kids in the Hall's" Bruce McCulloch in drag. Actually, what would have made this movie more enjoyable would of have been if all of the female teachers were drag queens (a la Charles Busch in "Die, Mommie, Die").

      So I checked out "Mona Lisa Smile" tonight for two reasons. One: it's a movie that is generating popular interest while "In America" is a indie movie that the WIBC audience doesn't give two shits about. Two: it gives me an excuse of not seeing it with my girlfriend. If it sucked, it gave me a even better excuse. Unfortunately, it wasn't too bad. Even if the movie was very paint by numbers, the performances were decent and the story sucked me in. Julia Roberts was herself but all of these rumors I hear about her being a uber-bitch kept popping in my head when watching this movie. The one thing I did notice was that Kirsten Dunst is looking more unattractive over the years. She just doesn't do it for me. Julia Stiles, however, looked cute. There were moments where it reeked of more gayness than LOTR (come on, all of those manly glances at one another) but whatever. I hated the fact that the security guy was a complete dick to me. I was about to get the metal-detector wand waved over me when the guy, pure redneck, told me that I couldn't take my cell phone in. I told him I have it off and he said, "Doesn't matter." I told him I was press and the he said "doesn't matter." The second time he managed to flash off his gun in his holster. Fucking dick rent-a-cop. The movie was at AMC in Greenwood if that says anything. Oh well, time for "Family Guy!" G'night.

      Man, this blog's like crack. So last night I checked out the final part of the LOTR trilogy and man, that movie was un-fucking-believable. This ghetto chick (w/her kid of all fucking things) was talking throughout the movie, but it was more "you go Frodo" and "Kick Gollum's ass" kind of stuff. So I didn't mind that really. The action was top notch and all of the actors brought out their A-games.  Especially Sean Astin, who is just NAILS as Sam. To compare these three movies to Star Wars: Ep I and II is a joke. George Lucas has no idea what the hell he's doing anyway, so screw him and his ewoks. The movie is 3+ hours so bring a catheter. My only nitpicks was that it felt like there was five different endings and there was no Christopher Lee. Also, it's a bit rough in the beginning but I felt that about "Two Towers" and I love that film. But this movie is so worth the eight bucks even though I saw it for free. Hell, I'll pay full price to see it again. Anyway, there will be a full review coming soon. Now I'm trying to figure out whether to see "In America" or "Mona Lisa Smile."  God, I am such a nerd.

      So yeah, here's some links and my e-mail. But the majority of you already know me. You know, just be happy I'm taking up a hobby or something. Anyway, my semester is ending and it's been the easiest bunch of classes I have ever taken. Then again, with such tedious sections like "Comics and American Culture" and "History of Television," you would think I'm embarking to be the next editor of "High Times." Just don't tell my dad because he's the one putting up the money.

      Holy crap, look who just made their own blog! Hello everyone (or just one by the rate of friends I have left) to my first ever...thing. Anyway, like the title this is still a work in progess. For those that do not know me, I'm a 23 year old in my final year at Indiana University (of Indianapolis) majoring in journalism. I work as a producer/ board-operator for talk radio station 1070 WIBC AM. I am also a movie reviewer for the station and can read my crap at  urlLink wibc  So I hope you enjoy and stuff. More to come.

      -Oh my god. I feel fucking crappy today. I went to the office Christmas party at the last minute. I was concerned about the dress code there because I heard it was real fancy and stuff. Thankfully, I found nice pants in my pile o' clothes and I went to the target on the way home to pick up a nice shirt (god bless that place). My mom forced me to take her car because she was all concerned about icy roads and knowing the piece of shit I drive plus the alcohol I will have soon consumed would end up being bad stuff.   -So I arrive there all nice looking and crap and WOW, what a party. Everyone was in suits and dresses like it was fucking prom and shit. There were gambling tables but you didn't win money or had to spend your own. It was kind of like Monopoly money and the amount that you "won" you received a raffle ticket where you could win prizes like jewelry store certificates and stuff like that. I won a 50 gift cert. at this day spa which is neat. Someone won a $1,500 Scooter which is kind of ironic given with the winter weather already here. But I digress.   -After the party ended, everyone moved towards Nicky Blaines, which is a big cocktail lounge type of place. It was interesting in that "Eyes Wide Shut" kind of vibe. But half of my buddies from work couldn't get in because it was so packed. So I left and went with them to Slippery Noodle which was fucking awesome. That's the kind of place I like to go to. We were out all night until 4:00 in the morning. My mom called me six times (I left my phone in the car) which I understand why because she needed to take the kids to school today. By the end of the night, I had consumed four jack and cokes, two guinnesses and two shots of pineapple tasty things. I also had met more co-workers in one night than the three years that I have worked there.   -My mom's pissed at me, I feel like crap and I forgot to turn in my "Mona Lisa Smile" review. Then again, I really don't think a Julia Roberts movie will be the focal point of this week at the cinema. Oh well, I had a fun time and got to know loads of nice people who wll probably forget me when I go back into work later.

      -I just got back from seeing "in America," directed by Jim Sheridan and features Samantha Morton. It's about this Irish family sneaking into America and going through various struggles. Really good I must say and there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Yes, even I cried like a little bitch. Last night was "Big Fish" and it wasn't bad. The cast is great (Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Ewan McGregor) and the story wasn't bad. But director Tim Burton was almost trying to say "Look! I can do serious material while mixing in the weird crap! Nominate me for an Oscar!" Anyway, good but not great.   -Tomorrow night is the big office Christmas party and I was thinking of going. The problem is that its going to be swanky and people with nice clothes are going to be expected. I have little nice clothes and are unsure of what in particular to wear. Maybe I'll buy a nice  urlLink shirt . That'll impress the boss.   -My little brother Josh is only nine and he's already done more damage at school than I have. My mom had to talk with the principal this morning because Josh said a not so nice thing. This kid was making fun of Josh and he told this kid to "lick his penis." I didn't teach him to say that because I would him taught him that a simple "fuck you" and a punch to the balls would suffice. Anyway, this girl overheard and told on my brother. Earlier in the week Josh showed me a magic trick taking a rubber ball and hiding it in three cups. This is what he told me, "This is what I learned from growing up on the streets." Possibly the quote of the year for me. Yep, were a family full of troublemakers.   -What pisses me off are the idiots that knock the "Lord of the Rings" fans for waiting outside in line hours before it starts. Hey, I would never wait out in the fucking cold for anything even if Marvin Gaye suddenly happened to rise from the grave and perform for one night. But that doesn't mean that Johnny Redneck doesn't look equally as stupid for waiting this Saturday for Colts playoff tickets or sitting outside at a 3 hr. college football game.    -Other things that piss me off right now: the growing number of really skinny girls (eat dammit), idiots who say that capturing Hussein was a trick to gain voters for Bush , West Coast Choppers t-shirts, Von Dutch t-shirts (fuck you), the fact that almost every FM morning show in Indy has more fucking talk than music, bandwagon jumpers (late-Colts fan I'm looking at you), the fact that I can't find goddamn 32X34 jeans at any Abercrombie store(I know, I know), jeans that have a fucking button-fly, parents to bring their extremely young kid to an R-rated movie, people who talk about how a movie sucks while they're sitting in the goddamn thing (leave!!!), people that call soda just 'pop,' the term "metrosexual," those hardcore Emo kids, fucking hippies at school that dick around with their guitars, any white guy over 30 using the same vocab as Snoop Dogg and motherfuckers that arrive to the movie 20 minutes late and fucking walk around for another 10.

Or there might be power-ups you can gain from attending testicular cancer group meetings.  I give up.

"I know for a fact he likes girls. I've seen him totally make out with a girl," the pop singer says.   Ahem. First off, ew. Second, why is Aaron Carter the most credible supporter all of the sudden? I mean, this is the same person who brought us "Aaron's Party (Come Get It)" and "That's How I Beat Shaq."

      -I'm stuck here at work sitting in a small production room taking farm market reports and feeding them out to affiliates. It's not too hard and there's a lot of down time. So I checked my grades and here they are:            History of Television B +        Sports Writing          B        Comics in American Culture B -        Middle Eastern Culture Studies   C +  The last one hurts considering we had no tests and few homework assignments. The majority of the time it was participation and crap. She didn't even come up with a syllabus until midterms! Then again, I barely gave a rat's ass of what was going on so screw her.  Overall, I pretty much floated by this semester. It's not that I didn't care it was just...Ok, I really don't care. None of the classes were challenging and I just want to be over with. But I'll probably regret saying that and end up getting some kooky major three years from now. This is a very anticlimactic end to this semester indeed.

      -Well, another busy day. I didn't get much sleep (bad dreams) and once I woke up the first thing I see on TV is Dan Rather looking like hammered shit. Once I got out of the shower I finally realized what he was doing on at 6:30 in the morning. You know, the whole Saddam being captured and junk. The one thing I did enjoy was Rather's take on the whether or not there was a confirmation: "You can play poker with your mother but you still want to cut the cards." Or something like that. It kind of threw me for a loop and was kind of disappointed that even though the TV was non-stop about it, it didn't feel like a big news kind of thing. Maybe because WIBC was doing this radiothon for the Savation Army and I was pretty much spaced out the entire day. I mean, we did do our extensive coverage but I guess it being Sunday and all that's why. I know that tomorrow all of the shows will go ape about it.   -I ended up getting a C- on my sports writing final and my teacher was being kind. I end up with a B but I'll take what I can and just move on. I also found out that I got a B+ in my history of TV which kind of irks me. I know the reason why was because of the second test I took but I was extremely sick and high on cold medicine that day. I guess I was striving for A's but with a busy work and internship schedule, I say I did okay this semester so far (Comics and Middle Eastern are unknowns).   -I figured out everything my family is getting me for Christmas thanks to my faulty Amazon wishlist. I guess I should be happy but I feel kind of greedy as I'm looking at a big haul (DVDs ahoy!). I feel bad but I put a really good effort on everyone's presents this year thanks to Costco. That place rocks because there's crap loads of deals of quality stuff (Alien Quadrilogy for only 62 bucks!), a bunch of people passing out free food samples (I could have ate lunch there) and this great slice of pizza that was like $1.25. Seriously, I'm going to live there or be like my sister who is currently obsessed with the place (I'm trying to figure out the over/under on when the restraining order will happen).   -That's all I have to say. I'm sleeping in for the first time in a while. Oh, and Colts win!

      -Merry CHRISTmas everyone. It's been a while since this update but I've been pretty busy. There's been work and getting last minute presents and stuff. And the repeat viewings of "Bend it Like Beckham" ("Freaky Friday" is next).   -Last night, my dad got sloppy-ass drunk at a friend's CHRISTmas party. Then he dressed up as Santa and gave presents to the kids while he was still toasted. Later that night he attempted to put the presents under the tree while he was, yep, still buzzed on booze. Good times.   -I'm not going to stay long here so here's a list of my haul and they're all DVDs.       -Hulk       -The Beatles Anthology       -The Ben Stiller Show       -The Adventures of Robin Hood (Errol Flynn version)       -Cabin Boy       -Angel: Season Two       -Singles       -Alias: Season One       -Family Guy: Volume Three       -Looney Tunes: Golden Collection       -Firefly: The Complete Series       -Finding Nemo       -The Complete Superman Collection: The Paramount Classics of Max & Dave Fleischer       and.....that's it.

      Here's someone who disagreed with my statement that "The Incredible Hulk" TV show has aged over the years. I'm really speechless about what he has to say.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I think Lou Ferrigno did a GREAT job as the Hulk and that his acting was just fine for the part. Were you expecting for the Hulk to start talking?  How can you say he did a bad job with the role?  How do you suggest it would have been better?  The only thing that could have used altering was maybe the wig they put on the hulk and maybe his thick eye brows, but that had nothing to do with his acting.  His make up was what was fascianting about the role. He looked semi-real where as this Hulk looks WAY too fake. It's true. He looks ANIMATED where as Arnold, Robert and Kristine looked real as terminators. They didn't look like a cartoon.  Just looking at this Hulk makes me feel like Im watching "Who framed Roger Rabbit". And you say that THIS Hulk can act better than Lou Ferrigno? Are you insane? He looks like a CARTOON! He looks fake. He doesnt even appear to look like a human being.  Again it brings me back to my orginal question...what in the heck were you expecting Lou Ferrigno to do? How did he do a bad job?  He also showed emotion. You got the sense he was in pain and although appeared like a monster still had an emotional and sensitive side.  Bixby and Ferrigno did a great job with working with what they had available to them. They both did a great job acting. You can not lash out insults at the TV show b/c they didn't have the technology back then that is available to us now 20+ years later.  Look at the shows today that do have good effects. They SUCK! Plot? WHAT plot? The Incredible Hulk had a good plot. Most episodes were written well and were interesting. Bixby AND Ferrigno were good as well as Colvin (Jack McGee) and most of the guests each week were good too. The show even had a nice theme song to accompany the show.  The show had substance and depth. This movie looks sooooo lame and frankly I havent even watched it b/c it looks like an INSULT to the TV show. I have considered watching it and every time I think about it I change my mind b/c of how fake and stupid it looks. It looks like a freakin VIDEO GAME!  --------------------------------------

      - Yeah it's been a while since I updated this but I have been busy. I had to produce the morning show from the day after Christmas up until yesterday. It got the point that I wasn't bothered by waking up at 4 in the morning. I missed New Year's for the second consecutive time which sucked because I really wanted to get drunk. But it was nice and I got to have some fun moments (Jersey Johnny talking about his H.S. football days). I guess if I was offered a full time gig, it wouldn't be bad. The only thing that would suck would be that I would have to say good-bye to staying up until 1:30 to watch dating shows.   - I came up with my year in review and so far, the cats at the station's website have yet to update it. But that's what I get for typing it up at the last minute. Hopefully, it will be up soon and there will some good feedback.   - I'm starting to hate going to the movies...and paying for it. My only reason is that you're subjected to watching 20 minutes of commercials before the actual start time for the movie. The ones they play are just horrendous. One example is this COKE spot with this kid named Delux showing his crib. Christ, just stab me in the crotch.   - Saw three movies in the last week. LOTR: ROTK, Cheaper by the Dozen and Cold Mountain. One was great and Two Sucked. You figure it out.   - I just figured out when there are religious conventions that take place downtown: if the majority of the freaking mall is dominated by girls in long denim skirts/dresses/whatever then the Christ-crazies are there.

      -Sorry it's been a while since I've actually given an update here. I have been filling in for various people at work and then there's school. At the moment, I'm taking a film documentary class and...ballroom dancing. Yes, apparently I had one credit left to graduate so why not ballroom? Of course, the first time we did anything I was a fuck-up and that was when we were being taught how to line dance.    -Other than that, I've been being a real loser lately by watching a lot of TV . Wednesday was a watershed moment as I watched American Idol, The OC, Chappelle's Show AND Angel all in one night. On the movie tip, I saw Win a Date with Tad Hamilton (review will come soon), Torque (sucked) and Monster (awesome, but depressing).   -What I'm listening to right now:  urlLink O by Damien Rice ,  urlLink Give Up by The Postal Service  and  urlLink Chutes Too Narrow by The Shins .   - A couple of links:  urlLink Duck Hunt  and  urlLink Penguin Baseball    So far, I've wasted hours on these two sites and now you will too.

      -So I had to work the morning show today and tomorrow which is ok but the catch is that I have to wake up at three in the morning. And it doesn't help that since I'm an awards show whore I stayed up watching the entire Golden Globes. Add the fact I could not sleep due to buying a new pillow (fuck off, Christopher Lowell) and voila, no sleep!  Show went great today even though by ten I wanted to shoot everyone in the entire building. Oh, I no longer have medical insurance because I'm not a full-time student anymore and there apparently is nothing for part-timers where I work at. Sometimes, making these sacrifices for 8.50 an hour just never seem worth it anymore. Well, off to watch Buffy and Angel DVDs.

       urlLink News of the World   Swipe from article:  Rosie, who has two younger brothers, placed her ad on the popular eBay website earlier this month.   Her posting, which ran alongside ads for secondhand cars and unwanted furniture, read: "Eighteen-year-old university student looking to sell virginity. Never lost it due to lesbianism. Will bung in free massage if you are any good. Picture on request."   Rosie, from Dulwich, south-east London, currently qualifies for a government loan of £3,000 a year—less than HALF what she needs to cover fees and other outgoings. She is juggling her studies with part-time jobs to pay for her food, clothes, travel and the £300 a year she needs for textbooks.   Rosie said: "The government has made it difficult for people like me to follow their ambition to study.    -Uhhh, can anybody lend me £9,000? I see how some girls strip to pay for school but how desperate do you have to be to ho yourself for a higher education? I guess tuition has gotten REALLY high.

      -Update on that NBA groupie. My dad, who hung around the fieldhouse to entertain some clients, let me know that she said if I was a little older there would have been a chance. Yeahhh, right. What a load of crap.   -Another nugget of humor from my dad: when he was schmoozing at the Pacer game he was chatting with the security guys. He looked at one guy and asked him if he was alright. The security guy said he was fine and asked why. My dad said, "Maybe you need a chair." (Seinfeld reference).   -Saw Barbershop 2 and it was funny but not as good as the first one. Cedric the Entertainer needs to enunciate because I couldn't understand a goddamn thing he's said. It'll make a lot of money and please fans of the first film but its pretty forgettable.  -There are so many pingu (penguin) games its getting ridiculous.  urlLink This one  has you run penguins over with a snowball. The other requires  urlLink sledding . Enjoy.

      -Another fun week that's started out with the Super Bowl, naps and work.  Anyway, I went to a get-together on Sunday to watch the big game at my buddy Joe's house. Everyone was nice there (mostly family atmosphere but I guess better than a sausage fest) and I ate enough food for me to crap out for the next five days. Huzzah. I'm pretty much sick of talking about that whole Janet hooter exposure since I've talked about it for hours straight the next day. I'm kind of disappointed because it just didn't look sexy with it all bunched up and stuff. And the big surprise was Justin Timberlake? What a letdown, I say. Anyway, they fucked up and heads are pretty much going to roll for a good reason. And since I'm on the subject of work, I met Frank from "Trading Spaces" today. Nice guy and I got an autograph.   -CD of the month:  urlLink Danger Mouse   urlLink "The Grey Album"   I found this at Luna Music (my favorite record store EVER) and it's a "buy before legal action happens" kind of album.  Basically what this guy did was take just the vocals from Jay-Z's "The Black Album" and mixed them with beats from the Beatles "The White Album" to make spectacular results.  It kind of falls apart in the middle with a couple of tracks ("Change Clothes" is a good example) but its so not a novelty album and you need to check it out. Hell, I love it and I don't own "Black Album" or "White Album."   -Last night, I went to see the Pacers beat the living crap out of the LA Lakers (sans Shaq, Kobe and Karl Malone) and my dad of all people was trying to set me up with the most high maintenance of women. First, it was with this gorgeous gal that works with the Pacers and I purposely blew it by dropping the whole "I live with my parents" line. Oh well, didn't really care. Then I spent the majority of the game talking to this other girl my dad knows who just couldn't shut up. I mean, she was nice but I know she wasn't attractive to me so don't waste my time and don't be nice to me just because you know my dad. She was one of those girls that are high maintenance. In fact, she straight up told that she was and that she felt she demanded "nice things." Heh. Also, she's 27, no degree, works as a bartender in Broad Ripple, wants to be an actress and has dated an Indiana Pacer player. Once I found that last part out, I completely give up. Seriously, how could I woo her? I work at an AM talk radio station, still live with my folks and I review movies for fuck's sake. Not exactly something that makes the girlies go nuts. Oh well, there's always good ol' porn.

      Hey, I'm not perfect but these people have made my shit-list over the years at school...      -Let's start with the person who ALWAYS has to argue with the teacher every time in class.  An example is the fundamental Christian guy who has to debate with the science teacher about evolution. Really, I thought we lived in the modern age or something.  Another example is the overachiever who feels that he's smarter than the professor and must argue with him. STOP IT BECAUSE YOU ARE WASTING MY TIME!!!       -The 40+ year olds/Single moms/whatever that have to give you their life story about why they came back to school.  You know, that's nice and all but I don't give a fuck.  Don't expect me to look at you like you're Erin Fucking Brockovich (sp?). Just give me your homework so I can copy it.  (Extra: The person who gives your their life story when all you did was ask if there was any homework assigned)       -The group of people who come in class, talk the entire lecture and not pay attention while breaking your concentration, then ask to borrow your notes.  Grrrrrrr.       -The girls who constantly wear pajama bottoms like they are surgically grafted to them.  It's probably the thinnest material ever and they would still wear it in 20 degree weather because they are comfortable.  Hey, I wish I could wear my pajamas too but caring for my sac is a big priority.        -People who brag about getting engaged all the time and HAVE to show off their ring.  Excuse me while I put on my "I don't give a fuck" face.  And no I'm not bitter.       -People who arrive late in class....when there's ten minutes left in the class.  What's the point?        -The girls who wear the tight clothes with all of their stuff hanging out and get offended after they catch you checking them out.  To quote Dave Chappelle "You are wearing a whore's uniform, lady."        -That freshman who constantly talk about their girlfriend/boyfriend who is still in high school.  Yeah, good luck with that.         -The really ugly person who thinks they have a chance with the really good-looking person in their class and struggles the entire semester to get with them.  It's like watching a car wreck.  (Bonus:  the attractive person who takes advantage of the smart homely person so they can pass the class.)       -The person who transferred to your school and talks about how their previous school was so much better.  This also pertains to that fuck who went to school in England or France for a year and talks about how much they hate America. Also, the foreign students who have to criticize your "Evil Country" while getting financial aid and scholarships out the ass.         -The person who have to relate part of their lives into the class lecture EVERYDAY.  Some examples include "When I was in the Army...,"  "When I worked for this company we did this...,"  "When I was in prison...,"  SHUT UP! Your not the professor so bugger off. Save the stories for your family, who will probably ignore you like always.  This could also go with the one guy who have to throw out really obscure facts out of nowhere (I call this guy the "Cliff Claven")       -The girl with the Tarot Cards and the throngs of people who want to get their fortune read. Seriously this has happened more than once.       -The guy with the baby-momma-drama.         -The girl with too much drama (and possibly a baby).             -The person who constantly talks to you while you are doing school work but when you ask them a question, they get pissed off.  I think my Vicadin kicked in.         -The lecture halls in general.  I've seen more social people at a wake than the lecture halls at IUPUI.         -The really hot chicks that only appear during days where it is sunny and seventy-five degrees.  Really, where do they go in the winter?      -People who start planning Spring Break....and it's September.        -The guy/chick with the cell phone that will let in ring during the class and is afraid to acknowledge it.         -That girl who is really sick and refuses to stay home and decides to sit right next to you. Then, you can't come to school because you caught her germs.          -The attractive girl with really low self-esteem.  Oh, wait, that's almost every girl in school (oh, TAG).        -That guy who's into Insane Clown Posse WAY too much.  Of course this could relate to the.....       -Fucking hippies who talk non-stop about Grateful Dead and Phish.  Nothing against the bands or anything, but these guys make Trekkies look tolerable.  By the way, Jerry Garcia is dead, you fucks.  Get over it and move on.

      -From my on-air segment that is. No more "Nick @ the Flicks" on the morning show because they are making changes to the show in general. I perfectly understand and I shouldn't take it personal. But shit, I'm pissed off. Sure, I still work at the station and  I should handle it professionally but I guess I'm kind of hurt about getting dumped. Plus, I got the word on a Thursday and I do the reviews on a Friday. Thanks boss. I cheered myself up by watching a Beavis and Butthead marathon on MTV2 and that Dateline interview with  urlLink David Gest , which is highest of high comedy. It doesn't take much to cheer me up.  But I'm still doing the reviews on the web, which I love doing, but I'm back to being behind the scenes guy at the station. Thankfully, what's left of my friends can still see free movies with me.   -Didn't see all of the Grammys due to working the morning show the next day but I did check out Prince and Beyonce tearing it up at the beginning. That was awesome, but damn Beyonce don't hog the entire spotlight from the man. After all, he's had a longer and more credible career than your fine ass.  One weird thing was the Beatles tribute that featured Sting, Vince Gill, Dave Matthews and Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes. Seriously, how the FUCK did that collaboration happen? And didn't Pharrell looked pissed off that he was stuck on drum duty or what?   urlLink This picture  made me laugh out loud though.

      -Seriously, if I had TiVo then  not only would I stay at home every freaking day but I would end up being one of those shut-in fatties on Jerry Springer. The reason for that is Wednesday TV virtually has almost all of my favorites shows on the same night. See, at eight its 70s Show followed by American Idol (seriously, WHO is going to win it? No one is talented enough!). Then it becomes tricky at nine. My dilemma is between watching The OC or Angel with the latter usually winning. Yeah, My life is so difficult and I am a huge nerd. But the WB station here always shows College BB games so it all works out as I watch my favorite show at 11. Anyway, 10 hour is South Park followed by Chappelle's Show (tonight's episode has me rolling with Prince and the robot guy).  -It really pisses me off that the WB is canceling Angel. I mean, the show gives solid ratings even though it hasn't moved up from its first year. But tonight's episode is a good example of why it shouldn't be given the ax. I mean come on, Angel got turned into a friggin' muppet! That's utter genius! But it was handled in a clever way as it was part of the story and not some ratings grabbing gimmick. It shows how talented Joss Whedon (creator) and the rest of the crew are. What frustrates me is that networks will cancel shows that are creative and entertaining to make way for bullshit reality shows (even though I catch myself watching Average Joe) just to save money.  I thought about modifying the site to make a campaign to save the show but  urlLink these guys  got it handled. Plus, you guys would have made fun of me because that would be nerdy.   -Greg Maddux to the Cubs? That's desperate. You know, I'm not even a hardcore baseball fan but this season is going to be very interesting.

      -My buddy invited me to this party on Friday night on the south side. Apparently, it was a sex toy party in the same way one would have a Tupperware party. He said something that single gals will be there so I agreed to come with. But then it got weirder when his parents came with us (he said he told me before, but I guess I wasn't listening). In fact, other girls' parents were also in attendance as they watched enormous vibrators and different types of lotions being passed around. An orgy didn't break out or anything, but the whole vibe kind of weirded me out. But then I had three beers and I was suddenly trying out the nipple cream (saucy!). I didn't hook up with any gals, but this drunk dad was calling me Ashton Kutcher (or "Austin" to drunk dad) so that was pretty memorable given the weird crap being shown off that night. We then met up with our buddy Eric as we ventured off to go clubbing at Tiki Bob's. When the girls we were supposed to meet up with canceled, we decided to check out a titty bar. The first place was at Wild Cheri, which apparently is where all the hag strippers go to. We stayed there for about 15 minutes as we used everything in our power not to make eye contact with the strippers with cottage cheese asses or the thugs sitting in the corner waiting to kill our suburban selves. We then ventured off to Brad's Gold Club, which was a dramatic improvement (three stages!) but I left about an hour later because I'm a whiny bitch (as in tired and having to work) so I left and came home around 2:30 in the morning.  I was lucky to leave with some money left and neither got a lap dance nor ventured off to the champagne room. By the way, Mom if your reading this...oh well.   -My Valentine's Day was lame. My only standout moments were going to Costco with the family and renting DVDs. And many wonder why I'm still single? Anyway, Costco is like Sam's Club but with better food and an enormous lack of white trash. But the cakes there are so awesome! This one that I had for my brother and sister's b-day party yesterday had this chocolate mousse in the middle and it was soooooo good. I had three big pieces that day and I feel like breaking out the pants with the elastic waist. As for DVDs, watched "American Splendor" (great) and "Capturing the Friedmans" (good, not great. the extras included were fantastic though).   -Made an attempt to watch the NBA All-Star game and that lasted about half an hour ("Alias" came on, dawg.). First off, Christina Alguilera was hot garbage doing "Star-Spangled Banner." She needs to stop showboating her diva vocals and sing that damn thing. And that drummer was pure ass. Nelly Furtado, who I think is good, did a weak version of "O Canada" but since I'm not Canadian, I really didn't care. After that, Outkast tore it up yet again with their two hit songs while the All-Stars came out (felt like a 45-minute intro). It's odd that everybody is losing their shit over Outkast now when they been around for damn near 10 years. "Hey, YA!" is a great song and even though its overplayed like a motherfucker, it has yet gotten old. Hell, that song is the only thing that keeps my nieces from crying in the car so my sister has to play the song throughout the damn car ride. Anyway, game was nothing but dunks and All-Star games from all sports are boring anyway. At least Ron Artest, my favorite player, got to play.   -Alex Rodriguez to the friggin' Yankees. It really sucks to be a Red Sox fan. I'm one in the casual category. Fuck the Cubs.

      -While running the Pacers vs. Sixers game, I noticed that whoever is in charge of playing the music at The Fieldhouse needs a punch in the balls. The reason is that it's 2004 and all they ever play during timeouts is 80s music like Corey Hart's "I Wear My Sunglasses at Night" or Janet Jackson's "Nasty Boy." Wow, that really intimidates the opposing teams coming in.   -Ever since my review of "The Passion of the Christ" I've gotten crazy e-mails from god people. People that like to use caps LIKE THIS AND TELL ME I'M WRONG. So its no surprise that I haven't responded yet although I want to ask the women that have written me if they own denim dresses.   -My folks changed cable dish services and as part of the deal I got my very own system in my room. Thanks guys for giving me this...four years later. But I really can't complain since I now have Independent Film Channel in my own room now. Yes, of my entire week THIS is the biggest news. I need a life.    -Actually, my computer crashed thanks to some douche sending it to me. It took me three days but I got it fixed (correction, my mother got it fixed. once again, lame) even though I'm having problems with my internet connection. Stupid internet losers and friggin' viruses.   -I didn't review it, but if you were a fan of Super Troopers, then check out  Broken Lizards' Club Dread. Very great subtle humor mixed with gratuitous nudity and slasher gore. Bill Paxton is HILARIOUS.   -Another recommendation is Chappelle's Show: Season 1 on DVD. It was sold out almost everywhere I went but I found it at Wal-Mart of all places. Funny stuff but no extras. It's is uncensored, however, so F-bombs ahoy!

      - I don't get HBO and I haven't watched the fucking thing since its first season. I understand why people are all BONZO GONZO over the show but I just never got into it. Now, ask me about Alias or The Practice and I'll talk to you for hours about that. Man, James Spader is the fucking man. I felt the 3-part story came to a disappointing end (Patrick Dempsey, why?) but the whole thing was an acting showcase for the Spade-ster.   - This week I'm working on the Dave Wilson show on WIBC 4-7pm and I will probably not catch any previews this week. I think the only thing is like the new Johnny Depp movie (Secret Window).   -I checked out "Inside the Actor's Studio" featuring Hugh Jackman and I think I have a man-crush.

      -Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, has a  urlLink blog  (almost everyone does now lately) and he had this to say about the support of my favorite NBA team...      what is up with Indiana Pacers fans. Your team has the best record in the NBA and you aren’t selling out games. That’s not the state of Indiana that I remember.    -I guess I have to agree with him in a way because the fans have been fat and lazy with the support of the team.  But I guess you have to understand that when the Pacers have been kicked out of the first round of the playoffs for the past three years, you have a lot to prove great record and all. Including the fact that its going to be four years since they went to the NBA Finals (one of the top 10 moments of my life, btw). Well, off to work.

      -I use to be a big fan of ESPN but the only thing I watch anymore is"Pardon the Interruption."  urlLink This article  pretty much hits the head of how I feel about the network. I think "Dream Job" is both a waste of time and its insulting to the veteran broadcasters fighting for air-time. Also, Stewart Scott's catchphrases causes me to have seizures.   -So I was channel surfing when I came upon X-Play on Tech TV. While I'm not crazy about video games or computers in the same way that I am about movies or music, I cannot stop watching this show. Its funny, somewhat interesting and I have an enormous crush with the co-host  urlLink Morgan Webb .  Maybe its because she's a redhead (actually, its now dyed black, which makes her look like an employee from Hot Topic) or the fact that she's cute and likes to play video games. *Sigh* Hey, don't tell me that you don't have that certain person on TV that you get all 13-year-old girl on. Anyway,  I'm so obsessed with the channel that I'm even watching  urlLink "Unscrewed" with Martin Sargeant  and that show sucks.

      -It's fun to be in my family. I was babysitting on Friday and while I was resolving a fight between my two little brothers (over video games, of all things), my little sister accidentally swallowed a charm on part of her bracelet. She was screaming and freaking out but I kept the situation cool. Thankfully, everything was resolved gracefully and she was taken to the hospital to have the charm fished out (it was stuck inside her friggin' chest). Then my niece had to go to the hospital because she was sick but the place they went to had a clusterfuck of a staff and my parents had to go there so they could resolve crap. So I was babysitter again for the second week (no one choked on anything, in case you were curious).   -I can't stop spending money on CD's and clothes. I buy 1.5 CD's per week (recent buys new John Frusciante,  N.E.R.D., old Deee-Lite) and I've been on a clothes buying frenzy. This comes at a time when I'm being told that this is a particular time when I should be saving up for my future (fuck social security). I wish I could have like a dog collar giving me a electronic shock everytime I go to a BestBuy or American Eagle but then I would be a burnt vegetable ala Ellen Burstyn from "Requiem For a Dream."

      -Not a fun day. At the moment, I'm at work running Rush Limbaugh nursing a sore butt (from working out at the gym on Saturday) and a sore throat. Tonight, I get to check out "The Alamo," which I'm not too thrilled on seeing (going from a R rated epic to a PG-13 flick that's been delayed several times). With the exception of "The Girl Next Door, "which was surprising entertaining, this week is kind of lackluster at the theatres.   -Continuing my spending habits, I bought " urlLink One From the Heart " on DVD. Francis Ford Coppola made this after going through hell with "Apocalypse Now" and while he had some good ideas here (starting his own movie studio, for example), the movie itself is so-so. The music by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle is fantastic and it warrants a rental at least. The extras the DVD are cool too, but I think I'm kicking myself for spending 30 bucks on this flick.   -Here's a neat website for those that like to experiment...with renting videos. Called  urlLink What to Rent , the website, offers a website that recommends movies based on your personality.  So far, I have seen 5% of the movies that someone recommended me. But still, pretty handy for those looking for different routes of renting.

I don't care if you met your wife on the set of the Big Chill, shut up and let me watch my homoerotic superhero movies!  -The fact that A.) attempting to find Leni Riefenstahl's "The Olympia" on video and B.) trying to rent stuff from the public library are almost impossible to accomplish.   -I paid over 200 bucks to fix my computer and I'm still finding problems. Seriously, can't I just browse the web for MILFs just once?   -The whole pay inside the gas station situation rahter than filling it up then paying for it. It makes me feel that even though I'm getting fuel in the most skeaziest of neighborhoods, I'm sad that they cannot trust me.   -Going to a Prince concert to have his royal badness play his hits but briefly. Come on, give me an entire accoustic version of "Sometimes it Snows it April" you purple bastard!  -The sad fact that once I pull out my camera phone to take a picture of the Prince concert, 20 other fags do the same thing.   -Missing my deadlines. Seriously, I beat myself up over it.   -The fascinating yet sickening "I Want A Famous Face." It bugs me that these people spend gobs of their own money (which I would like, by the way) so they can NOT look like the celebrity they obsess over. Seriously, those twin douch bags do not look like Brad Pitt. His retarded half-cousin, maybe.   -Working 11am-6pm and 8am-4pm straight with no breaks.   -People who feel that I must see "The Passion" again. "Life of Brian" was more fullfilling thanks.   -Those fucking mesh hats are still around and Ashton Kutcher is back for another season of "Punk'd."

      - Wow, Boston really sucks. It almost seemed pointless for them to even be in the playoffs. Then again, if you have a human time bomb for a teammate like Ricky Davis then you're guaranteed to lose. It was a good series for Jonathan Bender (good, but still needs to break out in a big way) and Al Harrington, who's definitely grown up since last season. Then again, if I had to play for Coach Isiah I would pout too. Anyway, I totally see an interesting series against the Ron Jeremy coached-Miami Heat. Of course, now I have to wait a week to watch the Pacers play a friggin' game and that sucks.

      -So a week after graduation and it still hasn't sunk in yet. It wasn't some big emotional thing for me because I guess it wasn't like high school and I was graduating with my friends. My journalism class consisted of three people I knew but not very. Plus, I had an incredibly high fever.

      -For a graduation present, I received a new truck from my parents. Tell you the truth, I never expected to get it even when the guy from the dealership surprised me at my open house (he told me "we have a surprise waiting for you" and I immediately responded with "is it a stripper?"). It's a yellow, Ford F-150 FX4 and its soooo sweet. Two problems with it though: the first is that its a bitch to park. Thankfully, there's rear bumper sensors to guide me as I drive this boat-sized truck. Second problem is that putting gas in it costs a LOT. First time filling up was $47. That's like two DVDs for me. But it's a free truck and I'm thankful for receiving it. Let's hope I don't wreck it.   -Pacers 1-0 so far in Eastern Conference Finals. I don't want to get all ahead of myself but part of me feels like they won't win it all. Maybe its because the Miami game exposed their faults just a little and Reggie Miller just doesn't have it in him anymore. Then again, I will be happy if I'm proven wrong.   -Pretty exciting year when it comes to concerts. I saw Chris Rock (hilarious), Prince (great but a bit disappointing) and now David Bowie. It was real cool to check him out at the Murat despite having my mom, aunt and sister also attending. Everything was fabulous and there wasn't much of the new stuff (which is crap). Sadly, Bowie never got to play "Young Americans," which I think is one the sexiest songs ever made. But there was enough to make me happy. I haven't checked out the concert summer schedule (Danger Mouse canceled? crap.) but I want to check some stuff out.   -I have watched lots of season/series finales on TV. The finale for "Angel" rocked and it sucks that it will no longer be on the air. "The Practice" was some of David E. Kelley's best stuff in, like, ever and despite the crappy name to the spin-off show (Fleet Street?), any series that features James Spader AND William Shatner is a must-see in my book. I don't care much for "Friends" and even though the finale had some charming moments, I was happy to see the friggin' thing end. The one season finale that I was disappointed by was "Alias." Some stuff should have ended earlier in the season, the ending was disappointing and I'm sick of seeing Michael Vartan in a friggin' hospital bed.   -Tonight, I'm seeing the new "Harry Potter" movie but I can't say anything before its release because I had to sign a contract not to publish an advance review.   -My family also got a new puppy. Her name is Mable and she's a border collie. I'm watching her at the moment which is why I have to go. Later.

      The Eastern Conference champ is the Pistons. The Pacers led the majority of the game until they blew the lead courtesy of Ron Artest's elbow that led to a flagrant foul and a run by the 'Stons. While I'm happy about the the improvement of the team this season compared to last (see Isiah Thomas), they just didn't have what it takes to win it all. They're lacking good shooters outside of the arc (Ron, stop tossing it up because its not working) and they need to get rid of some dead weight (Bender, Croshere, Tinsley). Don't expect Reggie to retire though but he should just come off the bench now. Or at least shave off some of that millions he got from that contract to help the team sign up somebody in the offseason.   Oh well, someone's is going to be the Lakers' bitch anyway and I'm somewhat happy it isn't us.

      -What a cluster-fuck of a day. Not only did the Indy 500 get delayed by the rain for two hours, but then WIBC had wall to wall storm/tornado coverage where the Pacers game ended up airing on REAL 971. So it was odd seeing all of the news people running around franticaly and I ended up just calm and collected watching the Pacers suck ass in Game 5. Seriously, this team needs to get a complete overhaul in the summer. Reggie's too old, Jermaine just doesn't know when to fucking cowboy-up (He will never, EVER be an MVP), Ron-Ron is shooting the ball WAY too much, Jamal Tinsley is just a crap point guard and the bench needs more than Al Harrington to step up offensively. Then again, anything is beter than Isiah Thomas as the coach.

      -Hey, I wasn't the only one who guessed wrong. Almost every major sportswriter in the nation felt the same way but who would have known that the Pistons would take the title in a TEAM effort (you hear that Kobe/Shaq?) and while the Indy loss still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, they have a lot of great players. Although I may barf at the fact that Elden Campbell and Darvin Freakin' Ham has a ring before Reggie Miller. But I bet Washington/Boston/Orlando are all kicking themselves for trading away Richard Hamilton, Chauncey Billups and Ben Wallace.   Some questions that popped up while watching the game....   -Does Michelle Tafoya look like a man or what?   -Is Mason (Detroit's P.A. guy) the most annoying person ever?   -Is Tom Tolbert legally retarded?    -What's up with Chauncey winning the MVP?

      In 2000, “Pitch Black” was one of those films that, despite not being a smash hit at the box office, instantly became a cult hit and would later have a second life on video. I’m a fan of the feature as well and the reasons are this: the character Riddick (Vin Diesel in a star-making performance) is the coolest anti-hero since Snake Plissken and director David Twohy (“The Arrival”) created an engrossing sci-fi/horror flick (on a low budget, no less) that recalls the “Alien” franchise.   Since then, the two have gone different paths. Even starring in hit films “The Fast and the Furious” and “XXX,” Diesel has not solidified his status as this decade’s action star (due to clunkers like “Knockaround Guys” and “A Man Apart”) while Twohy made a great film that no one saw (the submarine thriller “Below”).

      There are times that I tend to agree with most out there have become irritated by Michael Moore although I feel that he’s just like every other slimy politician out there. He comes across as arrogant and obnoxious whenever interviewed by the media. The lies he tells are obvious and quickly discovered (his Oscar acceptance speech, the fiasco with Disney involving the distribution of “Fahrenheit 9/11”). And with every interesting fact or evidence Moore presented in the entertaining “Bowling for Columbine,” there happened to be numerous flaws and inaccuracies to follow.   Of course, there’s already criticism of Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11” being an epic anti-Bush propaganda film which kind of irks me because I wonder how many of these conservative talking heads have actually seen it.  urlLink Read more Fahrenheit 9/11

      After “Spider-Man” broke box office records in 2002, the fan base for the hero has grown even more. Sure, there’s even more comic book films that seemed to have multiplied like Gremlins but people will always have a fondness for Spidey. Besides all of the obvious reasons why they like him (cool costume, abilities, etc.), it’s the fact that he’s the most relatable of all the superheroes.

Because she's the only attractive member in the group    3. D'arcy of Smashing Pumpkins.  She has that look that says "i may go to art school, but I'm a dirty girl." And yes, I'm drunk again.    2.Sean Yseult, bassist of White Zombie.  She has this something about her. Very powerful and confident. Red hair is always a plus in my book. Plus, she looks like she would be fun in the sack.    1. Melissa Auf Der Maur, formerly from Hole. Redhead, Extremely hot and can play guitar. 'Nuff said, true believers.

The patriotic speedo bit with a near stone-faced Seann William Scott. Hilarious.       3. Robert Goulet does gangsta rap and Ferrell not only drops the N-bomb in front of Jay-Z's crew and gets away with it, but proceeds to make everyone laugh!        2. The one where he's Sarah Michelle Gellar's dad and he screams, "I drive a Dodge Stratus!!!" I can never look at a Dodge and keep a straight face since.        1.

      -So it's been a while since I updated this and I have a good reason. Two actually. The first is that I'm clocking crazy hours at work and I'm officially titled the "fill-in bitch" for every full-time producer on vacation. This week, I'm doing the morning show which requires me to wake up at four in the&nbsp;freaking morning. I'm about 20 minutes away from hitting the wall. This is also why I didn't write a review last week, but I'm always the one with excuses, eh? And the other reason is that I'm addicted to the website, Hot or Not. It's sad actually because I spend more time on this site than anything else. It has gotten to the point that I have posted  urlLink my own picture  (last time I checked: a 8.9 out of 10) .&nbsp;It's kind of sad really.  &nbsp; -Saw the Manchurian Candidate remake with DENZEL~! and it was a pretty good film.

I'd probably pay $8 to see the latter, so there you go.  &nbsp; -I'm also obsessed with the show  urlLink Dinner For Five &nbsp;which features Jon Favreau shooting the shit with the coolest of celebs (Burt Reynolds to Vince Vaughn) while eating lobsters and all that stuff.&nbsp; This inspired me to make up my dream list of living celebrities to have dinner with. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Mick Foley- Never was on Favreau's program, but if you ever read his books then you would know that he would be perfect for it. He tells some of the greatest stories and is just hilarious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Vince Vaughn- The only person who can piss you off and crack you up at the same time. Check the Dinner for Five where he &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Kevin Smith - Another guy that I could listen to for hours. He's blunt about almost everything (his Prince story is classic) and is even honest about himself.  &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Ron Livingston - When he was on Dinner for Five he came across as a pretty cool guy. Also ,&nbsp; I could bug him about Office Space and his memorable line in Adaptation.  &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Burt Reynolds - Because he's the fucking Bandit.  &nbsp; As for deceased, here's the line-up: Orson Wells, Akira Kurosawa, John&nbsp;Frankenheimer, Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock (yes, I'm somewhat predictable). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      You remember those "good touch, bad touch" presentations you went through in school? Well, they happened to print a comic book on the same subject. A  urlLink SPIDER-MAN comic  of all things! I totally forgot about this because they passed this out at some state fair. It's funny...in that wrong kind of way.

      -If there’s ever been a director who has pigeonholed himself so quickly in his career then it has to be M. Night Shyamalan. There were many reasons why the entertaining but overrated “The Sixth Sense” became a hit but what really drove audiences to the movie was the twist ending. It was clever and forced many to watch it over and over again to understand how the ending happened (repeated viewings = $).   Since then, Shyamalan has resorted to... urlLink READ MORE ON THE VILLAGE

      Just got home and man, what a disappointment. The acting&nbsp;was bland, the story is boring and the weak twist ending is an example of M. Night Shyamalan writing himself out of a fucking corner. Seriously, save your eight bucks cause it was pure shit. More to come.

      -Apparently, some 40-year-old guy convinced some, correction SEVERAL, &nbsp;people to come over to his house and  urlLink remove their clothes  because it was for a "radio contest" on RADIOnow's Billy and Marco show (which sucks, by the way). &nbsp;He told them to also put on clothes that were smaller than what they usually wore as well. The perv said that they would win&nbsp; a prize of $50,000.&nbsp; Of course, complaints from the traumatized parties followed and arrests have been made. Ok seriously, how fucking STUPID do you have to be to go to some complete stranger's house and take off your clothes? In every radio contest, there are representatives at the station that will be involved in every aspect just for legal reasons. And at these contests, there are the radio station's banners and promotions people for publicity reasons. I think red flags would immediately go up if I drove up to&nbsp;just some&nbsp; house and would be told by an old perv (and not some "DJ") to strip. Only in Indiana.

      Hi,  &nbsp;&nbsp; So one day my friend Michelle, a photographer for INTAKE weekly, asked me to come help her out on a photo shoot for a article on debt and stuff. I ask her, why me? She replied, "You're available and not ugly." Anyway, those in the Indianapolis area can pick this up and find different pictures of me making stupid faces. Those outside of Indy can click on this  urlLink link &nbsp;&nbsp;and witness the beauty that is me. Yeah, this isn't a life-altering announcement but I just like to pimp myself as much as possible because it makes me feel important. Sad I know.

      - Oooo, John Kerry  urlLink threw out the first pitch  for the BoSox-Yanks game in Fenway. Wow, Teresa told a reporter  urlLink to 'shove it.' &nbsp;Aren't they both radical? Whatever, they're more like two of the fakest pieces of crap ever. Look, the only reason why people are rooting for Kerry to win is because they'll vote for anybody but Bush. Kerry lacks charisma, he's a phony and he throws a baseball like a fucking bitch. Then again, I voted for Ralph Nader four years ago so what do I know.   -The one thing you never want to do when coming out of the bathroom...smell your own hands. I saw some fat intern do this and my day has been screwed up since because all I can think about is whether he washed his hands and why he smelled them in the first place.   -What I'm listening to:&nbsp;  urlLink Jamie Cullum  (jazz music who does great covers of "High and Dry" and "Frontin'"),  urlLink Joe Henry ,  urlLink Keb Mo ,  urlLink Tahiti 80 ,  urlLink The Hives    -I also picked up the new  urlLink Van Halen Greatest Hits  and it's pretty rocking although the live tracks are just there for filler and the new songs are decent but bland. And for the record, I'm a David Lee Roth fan all the way. Hagar was a decent replacement but he's too blue collar for a&nbsp;group that was the uber-rock band.   -Watched a damn fine movie last night:  urlLink Ikiru, &nbsp;which is about a man who is dying of cancer and decides to build a city park. A simple plot sure, but it's more than that. It was directed by Akira Kurosawa and&nbsp;features the excellent acting skills of Takashi Shimura. Its a bit emotionally manipualtive and a bit long, but I have to admit the last 45 minutes I was bawling like a baby.   -Yes another link. This one is....  urlLink really cool and different .

      “Collateral” is one of those special films that works from beginning to end. The acting is perfect, the story and dialogue flows naturally and the direction is top-notch. “Collateral” is as cool and smooth as its Los Angeles setting. For mature audiences that want an escape of the teen-friendly films out there, then this is the film for you. It’s smart, edgy and violent. You couldn’t ask for anything better.  The film takes a simple premise... urlLink READ MORE COLLATERAL

      I just thought of something crazy. You know how there's like a  urlLink list of demands  that musicians make when they are on the road, right?For example, Christina Aguilerra asks for Flintstone vitamins (crazy bitch) and N'Sync asks for a box of Captain Crunch and Oreo Cookie cereal in their dressing rooms. But they ask for shit loads of stuff and they are probably here for a day and a half AT LEAST? Well, I came up with my own list of demands of what should be in MY dressing room. Here it goes.....  6- Cases of Fiji Water. 5- 24 packs of Diet Pepsi 2-Kegs of Guiness (if they actually put them in kegs) 10- Bags of BBQ Baked Lays 3- Oreo Double Stuffs 10-pairs of white cotton crew socks 1- Terry Cloth bathrobe (hotel quality, not shitty) 1- Pair of New Balance cross Trainers 2-boxes of Veggie Hot Pockets1- 40" HDTV Flat screen TV with Surround sound 1- 5 disc DVD Player witht the following movies: "National Lampoon's Animal House," "Boogie Nights," "Big Trouble In Little China," "Mallrats," "Clerks," " The Big Lebowski," "Super Troopers," "The Royal Tenebaums," "Citizen Kane," "The Seven Samurai" and some generic porn DVDs. 1-Sony Playstation 2 with these games: All the GTA games, Madden 2005, all of the Tony Hawk Pro skater games and NBA Street Vol. 2 5- Magazines: Spin, Entertainment Weekly, Esquire, URB and any generic porn mag. 10- pairs of green Jerzees t-shirts (size: medium) 1- Huge CD Player with following CDs Prince's "Parade/Under The Cherry Moon soundtrack," Jack Johnson's "Brushfire Fairytales," Shawn Smith's "Let it All Begin," Moby's "Everything is Wrong," Marvin Gaye Box Set, Johnny Cash's "At Folsom Prison," and Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique." 20- boxes of those Boire self-heating masks. 1- Sonic Care tooth brush 10- Bottles of Listerine 20- boxes of Trojan condoms (you know...for water balloon fights) 5- Spider-Man Web shooters (with 30 foam cartridges) 30- pairs of black/blue boxer shorts 5- boxes of KFC honey BBQ wings 10- boxes of KFC cornbread muffins 25- rolls of soft toilet paper 1- Golf cart 5- boxes of Crest White Strips  Ummm, that's all I can think of. But dammit, There will be more demands or I'm walking! Hey, think of your own and send them to me.

      -So my weekend was fun as I had to watch my younger brothers and sisters while my folks flew to Vega$ and not only gambled their life savings but check out the Elton John concert there. My mom brought me back the gayest t-shirt ever as it features a very large banana with two big cherries next to it (very phallic, I know) with the phrase, "I'm Still Standing!" on it. So, looks like I have something new to wear when I sleep. Anyway, the kids were on their best behavior as Mom got them video games and they all spent the weekend like mindless zombies in front of their respective Game Boy Advances. Meanwhile, I zoned out watching "Footloose" and "The Karate Kid" back and forth. Good times indeed.  - Once my parents got home, I took a friend to check out "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle" and I must say, this film will be a new cult classic. Wow, I haven't laughed my ass off that much in a while. It's also the biggest commercial known to man and it works as we immediately drove to White Castle and stuffed ourselves with sliders.  -So almost everyone at work has found out about my freaking male modeling and there's nothing like walking to your desk and seeing a big, photocopied image of you. False narcissism is a great thing.  -Yes, another time-wasting internet game. This time, it's POOL  urlLink but with bombs !

      -This weekend was crappy (fuck NASCAR) and the only thing that could cheer me up, of course, was a movie. So I watched " urlLink The Red Shoes " for the first time and I have to say it is now one of my favorite movies. It's a glorious technicolor epic about(I'm now reading from the back of the box) "A young ballerina (Moira Shearer) who is torn between two forces: the composer who loves her (Marius Goring), and the impresario determined to fashion her into a great dancer (Anton Walbrook)." The dance sequences, the great acting (Walbrook is the best of the bunch), everything is so wonderful here. It totally cheered me up. Now before you start saying that I'm light in the loafers, the biggest fan of "The Red Shoes" happens to be Martin F'n Scorcese.  -I think tomorrow I have to go see a preview of "A Home at the End of the World" starring Colin Farrell. No one really gave two shits about this film until there was an apparent test screening where one scene gave the audience a peek of, ahem, Farrell's full frontal-ness which followed with the audience applauding in response. Of course you know how stories go, the more they are told the more exaggerated they have become. You then hear stories about standing ovations over Farrell's supposed "giant weenus" and suddenly a movie that no one cared about is getting demands to get shown in their respective theatres across the country. Once again, there's no such thing as bad publicity and I hate Colin Farrell.
