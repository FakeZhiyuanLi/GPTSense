      Today I stopped by the Armory to find out more information about what's going to happen next week. Most of the information is still sketchy, but that's to be expected from the military. I think they should write down information in invisible ink, for all the changes that come along.  I'm also repacking all my gear according to the packing list I received from the company. It's gonna be tough getting all my stuff into duffel bags according to the list, so I'm planning on getting one of my storage bins to put extra stuff in. Tomorrow is the barbecue, so most of my family should be here. I doubt if I'll have a chance to post for a few days, but hopefully I'll be able to write something down early next week.

      Well, here it is... just a few more days until I report to the unit for mobilization. It's been a crazy week so far, and I've still got so much more to do. Repack all my gear in my duffel bags, put all my junk in storage bins to take out to Mom's house... so much to do, so little time. This Saturday, my aunt and uncle are planning to have a going-away barbecue at the house for me. Of course, the local relatives will be here for it, but I'm going to have to miss the family reunion on Sunday. Maybe some of my other relatives will head over to the company going-away ceremony before they head home. The former XO asked me to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the ceremony... I'm honored that they chose me to do it. I just hope I don't screw it up... a lot of people are going to be there. And if I do mess it up, I'll have to hear about it for the next 18 months from my buddies.  Hopefully I'll have more opportunities to post to this blog during the time I'm on deployment. I'll try to send pictures home, or at least post them on here so my friends and family can see what I'm going through. Maybe the next 18 months will go by quick.
