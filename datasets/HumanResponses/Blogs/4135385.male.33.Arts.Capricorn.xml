      Is it any wonder that President Bush has so many followers? Forget the NASCAR Dads and Soccer Moms, I’m talking about the Paris Hilton idiots. In a world where we are on the brink of a worldwide holy crusade. Where are very lives are at stake each and every day. What makes the cover of the USA Today? Paris Hilton reunited with her Chihuahua Tinkerbell. Are fucking kidding me?   It’s the USA Today. There was no other news in the entire nation, Paris’ rat dog rates front-page coverage. Really? Americans have the attention span of coked out five year-old with ADD. Apparently the war in Iraq, the failing economy, the presidential race, or the Olympics weren’t newsworthy enough; they had to include another story about America’s favorite skank and her rat dog. Really?  Is this how far we’ve sunk? Are these the family values we are seeking in America? What kills me is the number of people involved with this atrocity. There was the publicist who had an assistant send out a press release, the hundreds of typesetters who put the story on the page, the printers, the editors, the marketing department who agonized over which picture of Paris to use (Because there are only a few), the sellers, the paperboys, and the homeless guys selling them on the intersection. None of them had the balls to stand up and say, “Who gives a rat’s ass about Paris and her mutt. Don’t we have something better to talk about?”  What’s next. Are we going to see Paris’ menstrual cycle listed next to the horoscopes? If you’re a Libra watch out for those who would do you harm, and if your Paris Hilton, today is a heavy flow day, so avoid white skirts. Today’s a good day to wear panties for a change.   Why don’t we just give her her own section in the paper? That way I can throw that section out along with all the other coupons and crap.   Is she really that important? What does she offer society? If I find a smart, college educated Democrat infatuated by this skank, I’m going to bitch slap them and demand their degree back.  I can’t wait for her to get old. I can’t wait for the whole world to just suddenly wake up and realize, “Oh my God. She’s a skank. I can’t believe I bought her album.”  The only way the story of her missing dog should make news would be if Islamic Jihadist had kidnapped her dog and made a video that was released to Al-Jazeera.  “We will kill this cur unless the American people stop sending us pictures of the blonde whore.”

      There are certain political affiliation I can’t understand. They are almost oxymorons. Gay Republicans, I don’t know if they’ve checked the history of the party, but I would expect to see Rumsfeld on Queer Eye any time soon.  Gay Republicans are about as effective as Black Klansmen.  I saw one Senator from Georgia who founded a group called Democrats for Bush. They already had a group like that. It’s called republicans.  It makes about as much sense as having the oil companies write the environmental policy.  But groups have gotten so specific. Even Clinton had his specialty groups. He had MILFs for America, and he visited a chapter in each state.  I just think you should pick your group and stick with it. If you’re a Jew for Jesus, you’re a Christian. If you’re a Black Republican your Colin Powell.  If your a Republican Lesbian for Change, your Dick Cheney’s daughter.  If you’re a Democrat For Arctic Drilling you work for Haliburton.

      I do love the election year though. It happens each year there is an Olympic Games. It’s like the ultimate summer programming on television. And it’s a leap year too. What a bonus year. They need to move up the election date though, because by the time November rolls around, I’m bent.  They should do it in the summer. Have all the conventions, the Olympics, and then have the Election on Labor Day. Back to school with a new president.  All I know is,I am so invested in this election. I am either going to party like Mardi Gras on November 2nd, or I’m going to be making housing arrangements in Toronto.  I think we could get more people to vote if we changed the process a little. Give out prizes, put on a show something.  You walk into the booth, you pull the lever, sirens go off, balloons drop, you’re the millionth voter, you just won a million bucks.   You send in an absentee ballot and you’re automatically entered in the Publisher’s Clearing House sweepstakes.   Maybe if we could bet on it in Vegas. Person closest to the vote total wins. Bet on how many states a candidate wins. Double down on a recount.  Maybe if we televised the voting process. You could sit in a chair across from Regis Philbin and he’d ask you;  “You’re choice for President are John Kerry, Democrat, George Bush, Republican, or Ralph Nader, Independent.”  “Oh that’s a tough one. I know it’s not Nader. I made that mistake in 2000. Bush has been in office for four years, and he did make that tax cut which I’ll need if I win. Kerry is smarter, but he’s long winded and puts me to sleep. George makes up funny words I don’t understand, and Kerry uses real words I don’t understand. I’m going to have to use a lifeline on this one Reg.”  Maybe what we should do to increase voter turn out is send the Jehovah's around with ballots. They can make it to every door in America on just one Saturday.

      I do believe this, if you don’t vote, you have no right to criticize. You have to sit back and shut up for four years. You gave up your right when you couldn’t get off the couch.  But since I did vote. I get to criticize. That’s why America is great. We are free to openly critique our elected officials. It’s called Freedom of Speech and it IS the reason our soldiers are fighting overseas.  Freedom is the most important thing we have as American. Without it we are not Americans. We are not free. We have come nowhere in 228 years.  That is why I cannot understand why we as Americans can stand still when people’s voice and freedoms are trampled on by others.   I may not agree with you, but that’s what makes America great. I have the right to say it.  Don Henley was escorted off the stage because he made some Anti-Bush remarks. Don Henley, of the Eagles. What kind of remarks would you expect from a guy who wrote Hotel California?  Across the country artists are booed and boycotted because they spout a different view then the president. That’s not freedom.   When you confine protester to a gulag across the street, that’s not freedom.  When you are arrested for wearing a tee-shirt that criticizes the president, that is NOT FREEDOM!  What gets me is that four years ago, every comic in the world made fun of Clinton. There were African Bushmen doing Clinton impressions.   Nobody booed Leno when he would riff on Bill for his entire monologue. And Bill was cool with it to. he knew that was their right. He didn’t send the police after the protesters calling for his impeachment. He wrote a book about it instead.  That was Freedom.  I just want to feel that good again. I just want to wake up in that America again. I thought the new millennium was going to be this new frontier of wide open possibility. I got to tell you, so far. I’m not impressed.   If I had a time machine I would go back to the nineties and live them over and over again. Even if that does mean 10 more years of Pokemon and N’Synch. I’ll take the good with the bad.  Sometimes I hope to wake up and have the last four years be just a dream. I hope to wake up in the Lincoln Bedroom and find Bill Clinton in the shower tell me it was all just a dream.

      I don’t know who my ideal candidate would be. It would have to be someone I trust. Since, all politics are run by special interest money I’d have to be flexible on that.  Can someone out there tell me the difference between special interest money and a bribe. Last time I checked it was illegal to bribe a public official. A bribe was defined as the giving of cash  or gifts to gain influence. Wake up man. When did you America get the wool pulled over its eyes. When did we call giving money and gifts to politicians not a bribe but special interest groups.   If you give money to a politician and then ask him, or her, power to the sisters, to vote a certain way, isn’t that bribery? I’m not sure. Let me look it up. Hmmmnnn... Bride, bridal, bribery. Here we go. Bribe, verb French. To Bribe, to give money or gifts to gain influence, see special interest groups.  My ideal candidate would take no money what-so-ever from any special interest groups, he, or she, would only take money from citizen who wanted to support their message. They would have some dirt on them too. I like a candidate who’s no angel. Clinton had a lot of skeletons in that closet and I loved him for it. Like I said I would rather talk about a Presidential dick suck then war anyday.  Why are all these candidates running away from their past anyway. Embrace your heritage people. The people running the country for the next twenty years are going to be Baby Boomers. We know what you did. We know all about the 60’s and 70’s. We know how much pot you smoked, how much coke you snorted. Don’t lie. Embrace your heritage.  My ideal candidate would have followed the Dead for a summer, and dropped acid a dozen times. Because if there is anyone who has seen Jesus and can think outside the box, it’s him.   My candidate would admit to everything. No spin. Just come right out and put everybody in their place.  Baby Boomers need to stop hiding in the shadows of hypocrisy. We saw what you did to yourselves during those decades. My generation invented Ecstasy, you guys invented freebasing. We wear condoms because you guys didn’t.  We didn’t invent swingers, wife swapping, or the sexual revolution, that was the Boomers.   If you believe the Baby Boomer politicians, all the coke and pot was used by Erik Estrada and Leif Garret at Studio 54 and they had nothing to do with it. Pah-lease!   I’ve seen pictures of Kerry and Bush in leisure suits. Oh sure, you guys took part in one 70’s fad, but not drugs and sex. You’ll wear lime green polyester, but when it comes to a hand job in a disco, that’s where you draw the line.  Just admit it. The truth shall set you free.   “Mr. President why didn’t you volunteer to go into combat?” “Because it was combat.”  Admit that your votes are for sale. I’ll bet if the NAACP had raised a million dollars for Bush he would have spoke to them. He’d have Puffy as his running mate.  My candidate wouldn’t pussy foot around the issues, and he wouldn’t use political language. He would tell some one to fuck off. That doesn’t mean I endorse Dick Cheney, but when he told a Senator to go fuck himself, I had mad respect for him.  Millions of dollars are wasted each and every year on presidential campaigns. Over 200 million dollars on both parties campaigns. Kids in Oregon lost two weeks of school because they were 10 million dollars short in their budget. If either one calls themselves the education president they better not do it in Oregon.  Why can’t we do a national election on television? Do it American Idol style. The two candidates come out, give a speech, debate head to head, have Randy call them “dawg”, Paula could gush, and Simon could rip them a new one. When they’re done, America gets to vote. Boom it’s done, it’s over, and it doesn’t cost Americans half a billion dollars.   That’s how much this election is going to cost. Half a billion dollars. 500 million. Do you have any idea what you can do with 500 million dollars. You could buy the Yankees for two years. You could buy two court side seats next to Jack Nicholson and have money left over for parking. You could buy Oprah’s garage for that much money.  What I don’t understand is that the job only pays 400 thousand a year, before taxes. And apparently a blow job isn’t one of the perks. I would rather campaign for A-Rod’s job. 25 million a year, and poonany is included.  Half a billion dollars! We could invade another country for that much. It would have to be a small one, so Luxembourg, watch your ass.  My candidate would have to be smart. Americans are smart. Or at least we were. I’ve seen a few episodes of Springer that contradict that statement.   They would have to have a plan to reduce the need for even having a Middle East.   I refuse to believe that we can build a robot, launch it into space, have it land safely on a planet a million miles away, and control it from a joystick in Florida, but we can’t mass produce a car that doesn’t run on gas.   We can walk on the surface of the moon, but we can’t get more than 35 miles to the gallon.  Do realize for the price of one war, we could fully fund the development of a new gas free car. Imagine that oil free. No more Middle East. We could ignore them like red-headed stepchildren.  My candidate would have to believe in technology and education. I sick of dumbing things down for my generation. We’ve got whacked priorities. Even my own kind. Dave Chappell got a 50 million dollar deal with Comedy Central, a soldier in Iraq makes 1,600 a month. Britney Spears makes a 100 million a year, a teacher makes 30,000 a year. Is it any wonder that we need a million new nurses and firefighters this year alone.  People will spend 3 weeks on the street and in the rain to see the next Star Wars movie, but won’t give three cents to homeless guy in the street.  What’s more important to America, the latest boy band or your children’s education. Seeing as how we spend a hundred million dollars a year on Justin Timberlake alone, I think we know the answer.  My candidate would have to have the right priorities. Education first, boy bands and Britney last.   Education will set us free. The smarter we are, the easier it us for us to realize that Christina Aguilara is untalented. Smart people recognize that Paris Hilton is a skank. Smart people didn’t pay for a Creed album. Smart people invented Napster, so they could get it for free.  Education should be a qualification for President. If I have to take a test to drive a car, they should take a test to run the country. If I have to have a Bachelors degree to be in the management program at Blockbuster, the President should have at least a doctorate.  You have to pass an exam to practice law, but you don’t to make law...  You would think America would want the smartest man possible for the job. Stephen Hawking for President. He would make every other candidate look like Dan Quayle.   That’s how far we’ve sunk. We voted for a Vice-President who couldn’t spell potato. We sill don’t care if our president has good grammar, just that he can speak good.  If you got that joke, count yourself among the smart people. If you didn’t well... I’ll bet you can tell me when Friends comes on.  Why can’t we have an IQ requirement for our commander-in-chief. We’ve got an age requirement, a citizenship requirement, but when it comes to brains, a C-average will do.  And I don’t want just book smart either, but common sense smart as well. Too many smart folk lack the common sense to tie their own shoes. But I want a President who knows if we’re attacked by an enemy in Afghanistan, we don’t invade Iraq.   I want a guy who knows how to eat a pretzel. I want a guy who reads newspapers.

      After Florida, I think we can all agree that the voting process needs to be changed. I have a solution. Since America is run by corporations, why not hold an election like a corporation. Only shareholders get to vote. Shareholders in this case would be taxpayers. The more taxes you pay, the more votes you get. Let’s see the rich folk bitch about their taxes now.  Here’s how it would work. Each taxpayer would get a vote based on how much taxes they paid. People like you and me, we’d get three because we paid a third of our income in taxes. People like Teresa Heinz-Kerry, she’d get one, because she paid ten percent in taxes. Now if you want a bigger vote, give more to your country. Quit trying to dodge your civic duty of paying taxes.  It’s one of the things that infuriates me about America. We all talk about our civic duty. Our duty to our country. Part of that duty is paying taxes. In fact the word duty and taxes are synonymous. Yet every single one of us try to avoid that duty like a whore with leprosy. If taxes were the draft, we’d all be Canadians. Me too! I’m like a Jew at an Amway meeting when it comes to taxes. We all want to pay less, but bitch when the country is falling apart. No more. I going to pay my taxes with pride, because Iraq needs schools too.  To me taxes should be like a toll road. You don’t pay your fair share, you don’t get to use America. Corporations that hide their assets in a strip mall in the Bahamas, should only be allowed to business in the Bahamas. If Verizon outsources there customer support to India, I should be able to pay my phone bill in Rupees.    If you want to participate in America, then you have use Americans. And when I say Americans, I don’t mean just the white folk who have been here for three generations. I mean all Americans. Unless your name is Dances with Bingo Card, we were all immigrants once.    Isn’t it about time we stopped placing blame on illegal immigrants. We are so worried about them coming over here and taking American jobs, but we’re totally okay with sending our jobs directly to them.  We’ll arrest you and deport you if you want to pick lettuce in this country, but if want to make our Nikes there’s an opening in our new plant.  In my plan, the more taxes you pay, the more vote you have. The more service you give to the country, the more you get to participate. If you want to sit on your ass and watch Springer, fine, we’ll just take that vote that you’re wasting anyway and give to someone who will use it, like a migrant farm worker.  And when I say service, I mean all manner of service. Building homes for the homeless is just as important as serving in the military. You don’t have to be spout party lines to be a patriotic American. Service is not blind. You can serve by giving back to the community. We would be better off if we did a little nation building here at home.  See what happens, I voted for the guy who I thought was funnier, and nothing... I get this ranting instead. I am so sorry. It will never happen again.

      Normally, I wouldn’t be so politically charged. I am content just sitting back and making fun of America as it happens. But then again four years ago, I didn’t get angry every time I turned on the TV.  Remember those good old days. Remember when you tittered at the news, not recoil in disgust. I would much rather hear about some getting blown then blown up.  How long ago was it that our biggest problem was a stain on a blue dress. I miss Clinton. If you want to pass an amendment to the Constitution, pass one that will allow him to be president again.  I was reading that they are going to make a movie out of his biography. They described it as West Wing meets American Pie.  Bill was great. You saw him at the Democratic convention. I felt like the last scene of Shane. “Bill. Come back Bill, come back.”  We love him so much, we’ll nominate his wife too. Just so we can get him back in the White House. Two presidents for the price of one.  Those were good times. I loved being an American. We were proud. Now were scared, and I hate that. I got to believe that Bill would have found a way out of the current situation and gotten head at the same time.  He should have never been impeached. If his only crime was lying to cover up the fact that he slept with a fat chick, then I’m a five time felon, and so are most guys.  I would take Bill and all his faults over Bush any day! Eights years of peace and prosperity and all it cost was a blow job and a cigar, or 4 years of war, fear, lies, cost 3 trillion dollars and counting. Hmmnnn.... It’s a tough choice.  People say they are glad Bush is in office. He knows how to fight these terrorist. He knows how to win this war. Really? I flew here. They searched me, an elderly lady in a wheelchair, and a five year old little girl with a Hello Kitty backpack. Osama must be shitting himself.  Last time we checked Osama was in Afghanistan. We know because he makes more videos than Tupac, and they’re all postmarked Afghanistan. Do you think when we decided to send over a hundred thousand troops to Iraq, Osama went (Sigh) “Phweee. That was close. They almost got me. I guess I fooled them when I turned right.”  It’s mistakes like that upset me. I don’t like making funny of the president, and I don’t draw party lines when it comes down to making fun of somebody. I’ve made fun of Clinton, hell he kept me employed for eight years.   I even voted for Bush because I figured with his lack of speaking skills he would be good for material. Let me be the first to apologize. That will never happen again.  I figured what harm can he do. He’s got Colin Powell in there. We’ve got a three trillion dollar surplus in the budget. Really if he just shows up, kisses a few babies, the country can run itself. Again, I’d like to apologize. I had no idea really.   To be honest I never figured he would win, and neither did the majority of Americans that didn’t vote for him. I didn’t even factor in the whole Florida thing. That wasn’t my fault.   I just figured Gore was stiff and unfunny. I can’t make of him. I was looking out for my career. Who’s more likely to do something funny  Bush or Gore. Again. I’m sooo sorry. It will never happen again.  I was thinking he would do stupid things like choke on a pretzel, say silly words like “affluentable”, or puke on the Japanese like his daddy did. You know, he’d be the slapstick president. If only. I had no idea.  Sometimes I lay in bed at night, can’t sleep. I feel like this whole mess is my fault. If I wasn’t so preoccupied with who’s funnier we’d have a different world. I would have voted for Gore if I thought he would have banged an intern.  Gore was too stiff. Not funny. Now he’s fiery Gore, pissed off Al. And he’s gotten funny. His speech at the Democratic convention should have come with rimshots.   “We’ve lost a million jobs under the current administration, I know, I was the first one laid off (Rim Shot) Trust me, I know, every vote counts. (Rim Shot) Thank you Boston, I’ll be here all week, try the chowder.”  I should have voted for him. He fit most of my voting criteria. He had hot daughters, but I figured the Bush twins are more likely to get drunk and give me more material, so vote for Bush. That would be the only thing that could get me to vote for Bush, if his daughter did some hot Girls Gone Wild video. Then I would want to keep them around for four more years.  See, I’m willing to sacrifice the good of the country for a good tit joke. What a whore am I.

      Apparently Bush and Cheney don't like people who don't like them. In order to attend a Cheney rally, one had to sign a  urlLink LOYALTY OATH . I'm not sure if it was to George Bush or Haliburton.

      I don’t know why anybody would want the job of president. Especially these guys, They are all multi-uber-millionaires. And they’re applying for a 400-thousand dollar a year job. Not a nine-to-five job either. 24/7. No breaks, always on call. When you break it down that’s like 33 dollars an hour after taxes. That’s middle management. That’s chump change. No wonder the president is always being told what to do by someone else.  33 dollars an hour. That’s cheap. If I were getting paid that little, I would act like Middle management. I’d be photocopying my ass on the White House Xerox machine, faxing it to other world leaders. Getting drunk at the Christmas party, having sloppy office sex with the company slut in the janitor’s closet. Clocking out a five on the nose every day.  “Whooo! Five o’clock! It’s happy hour. I’ll take care of the budget on Monday...”  For 33 bucks an hour, who wants the pressure? If you are going to be president of something, be the first. There is no pressure there. You’re the first. Everything you do is new and innovative. How hard was Washington’s first State of the Union speech.  “Well, we’ve been a union for about a week now, and... well...that’s about the state of it. Nothing to report really. We got rid of King George. I think that we can all rest easy, now that we’ve gotten rid of a dictator. Still looking for those muskets of mass destruction. Still looking... Any questions... No. We should do this every year.”  I think that if I were president I would go mad with power. I think they all have, even Washington.  “I’m the father of this country. That’s right. Who’s your daddy America? You what I want a holiday. I want everybody to celebrate MY birthday. And I want a city named after me. No, to hell with that, I want a district. I don’t even know what a district is, but I want it. And I want to be on some money. Not just any money, real money. The kind people use everyday. Not the 100-dollar bill. Give that to Franklin. No, I want the one-dollar bill, so everyday; people will look at me damnit! And I want my head on the side of a mountain. My melon right there, carved into the mountain. And I want a monument. Not any monument, I want the biggest, tallest, cock of a monument you can find.”

      The only candidate I can respect right now is John Edwards. He knows what it’s like to be poor. Ten-dollar wedding band, couldn’t afford the hotel room on his honeymoon, went to Wendy’s to celebrate. He makes me feel like a millionaire.  Sen. Edwards’ little brother is in trouble with the law. Apparently he is a raving alcoholic who’s been arrested four times for DUI. A southern politician with an alcoholic brother, who says he’s not ready to be president.  None of the other guys knows what it’s like to be broke ass poor. When was the last time Cheney prayed he had more than 20 dollars in an ATM just so he could take something out? When was the last time Rumsfeld knew 13 different ways to prepare Top Ramen? Has Bush ever answered the phone in a different voice because he was trying to avoid a creditor? No.  Last time I checked the US was a few trillion in debt. I had creditors calling me for fifty bucks. I would pick up the phone and pretend I was someone else.  “Mike, no bro. He totally bailed. He doesn’t live here anymore.”  Next time I call the White House, GW better pick up.  “George Bush is not here my friend. I am not knowing where he is right now. Thank you, call again.”  I truly believe that you cannot understand a man until you have walked in his shoes. So in order to promote harmony among the races and classes, I suggest that we have rich white slaves. Just for one month or so. Let ‘em get a feel for the other side. Wouldn’t it be great to make Dick Cheney bail some cotton?  “I said bail that cotton Cheney!”  “Fuck you I’m Dick Cheney. I run this country damnit! (WHIP Sound, Cheney suddenly turns into a southern field slave) Yes sir boss, I’z gonna bail dat cotton. Swing low, sweet chariot....”  All the good Republican field hands working on the land singing good ol’ white people spirituals, without rhythm.  The black masters could take Ann Coulter out to the shed and have their way with her. Her new book would be titled, “The Myth is True, how Ann Coulter became a Democrat.”  The only problem would be Bush is so stupid he’d keep digging a hole trying to find the Underground Railroad.

      Today’s headline... “Bush Asks Blacks to Review Allegiance to Democrats”  Really? I’ll give the president one thing. He’s got balls. Huge Texas sized balls.  He actually asks blacks for their vote. Really? Balls, he’s got balls. That’s the equivalent of having your salad tossed in prison and then asked to pay for it.  The Republican Party wants the black vote. Really? And the Klan is now accepting Jews... When I first saw this I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a punchline to a Doonesbury cartoon.  After researching the story I couldn’t believe my ears. Every FOX news correspondent was touting GOP-Black relations. Really? I was curious what relationship were they talking about.  Was it Trent Lott? After all he did appear on BET. He loved black people so much that he led the charge at Ole Miss to give blacks their own fraternity. His own fraternity was far too overcrowded with white people. Blacks would be better off with their own.  Maybe it was Jesse Helms? He loved black people. He wanted to give blacks an extra paid workday by voting against Martin Luther King Jr. day.  Of course they could have been talking about Strom Thurmond. He so loved black people that he gave them his only illegitimate son.  Maybe GW was touting his own record on relations with blacks? Perhaps he could have made a better statement if he had made it a week prior at the NAACP conference. Or maybe he could have done better if he didn’t denounce affirmative action on Martin Luther King Day.  GW loves black people too. He loves them so much he wanted to keep 1000s of them out of that Florida voting mess.  But he’s right? What have the Democrats done to deserve the black vote? Civil rights, schmivil rights, they may have given blacks the right to vote, that doesn’t mean they have to vote Democrat.  Affirmative action, come on. According to such GOP wisemen, like David Duke, Jimmy the Greek, Jerry Farwell, this will only hurt black people.  So what have the Democrats done to deserve 92% of the black vote? What makes them so special? Maybe it’s because when you enter Republican and black into a google search, you get the web page of the Klu Klux Klan. I don’t know about you, but that kind of relationship with the Klan has always made black voters a little jumpy.  Maybe black voters like Democrats because of the difference between Clinton and Bush. Bill Clinton opened his office in Harlem. Bush thinks collard greens are well-trimmed golf courses.  Bush is the first president in 70 years not to speak to the NAACP. We all know how well blacks were treated 70 years ago. Or as Trent Lott called them “The Good Ol’ Days”.  Bush asked the Urban League if the Democrats deserve their vote, after he begged for their vote himself. I expected less applause and more of a laugh track.  You’ll see how much Bush loves black people when the Bush daughters are caught on Girls Gone Wild getting butt naked and freaky with Snoop.

      One of the big issues for this election is family values. America needs to return to good ol’ family values. Whose family are we talking about? Not mine. Who wants an Irish, Mexican Jew raised by a gay Chinese and a black lesbian. That’s my family, and even I don’t want those values.  George W’s. Not his. I don’t know anybody who wants a coke habit and two underage alcoholics in their family. The Bush family has been arrested more times than Larry Flynt.  Dick Cheney’s family? The only reason he wants to ban gay marriages is because he’s too cheap to pay for his daughter’s wedding.  My cousin invited me to my first gay wedding. I don’t know what to wear. The invitation said black chaps optional. I don’t think it will matter. When the reception comes, we’re all going to take off our shirts and start dancing anyway. My cousin is not too bright. He’s going to Wyoming for his honeymoon. I told him that Dick Cheney is from Wyoming, I don’t think they are too tolerant of gays in Wyoming. He said, “Well on the brochure it said, ‘Welcome to Bear Country’.”  I have no problem with a gay marriage. Two gay guys want to get married, knock yourself out. Doesn’t bother me. Two lesbians want to get married, doesn’t hurt my fantasy, I’m just in the corner watching anyway.  I don’t think I could be the minister at a lesbian wedding. “You may now kiss the bride... Slowly...That’s it. Real soft like. You know how daddy likes it.”  Let’s just look at the rich man’s idea of family values. Is it togetherness? Not when you send the kids to boarding school and have the nanny take care them.  Is it the sanctity of marriage? Not when you consider that 80% of the people who frequent prostitutes are married men. Only a man with money can afford a prostitute. There’s no poor man alive can talk a whore into taking a postdated check. The average “escort” cost $300 an hour. The only people I know who can afford that price are Republicans and Charlie Sheen. I know we’re not talking about Charlie’s family values. One family, three last names.  Is it trust in God? Those are the last words an altar boy hears.  Follow along on this one. Most poor people I know are Democrats. Most rich, are Republicans. Most poor people don’t have credit cards, most rich people do. Most on-line porn sites and phone sex numbers take credit cards. Ergo, most Republicans are pervs. So whose values are we talking about?  Don’t get me wrong. I believe in a strong family. But who wants to live in a ‘Leave it to Beaver’ world. If we all came to terms with our deviant behavior, pot and prostitutes would be legal, and we’d all be happy.

        I’d like to dedicate these next jokes to a true patriot, someone who truly cares deeply about this country and is trying to help, Michael Moore.
