      Hello All,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried to put together a comprehensive list for some emails but many of you have moved (so why not let you come to me ehh?) so if you have a new email let me know. I hope that this finds you doing well and enjoying yourselves. I wanted to give everyone a little update as I have been so busy that I have not a chance to see let alone talk to most of you.&nbsp; First, I want to say thank you to everyone who has been there for me lately, many have spent late nights talking and hanging out with me, it means more than you will ever know.&nbsp; When you face things like brain cancer in your family it can be the worst thing that has ever happened but it opens up your eyes to the really good stuff and makes you truly understand what is important to you and treat every day as your last.&nbsp; The prayers for my family and me have been felt and I have been blessed with steadfast friends and a fantastic family, I have a better life than I deserve and this summer has been unreal.  &nbsp;OK enough of the sappy stuff and on to the crazy life I have been leading lately.&nbsp; So it all started in on my birthday—22 shots (12 at louies and 10 at brothers)—to those of you who bought me the nasty shots, I will get you back and to those of you who took care of me or were on the receiving end of my projectile vomit thanks and sorry (it is still my contention that I was not drunk and we all know this to be true, the pictures prove it and even my bros couldn’t believe I was standing).&nbsp;&nbsp; I also apologize for my dogs behavior, he has eaten three couches, a mass of clothes (some were still on the unsuspecting victims), backpacks, personal items, pulverized a remote and destroyed my 400 thread count sheets, what guy has those anyway right? I woke up, walked in the bathroom, looked in the mirror to notice that I was dressed like a chicken (yeah you guessed it he ate the fucking goose down comforter). For your edification I had his family jewels removed—it seems to have slowed him down, I know it would me.&nbsp; He no longer seems to be laughing at me when I come home, just a down trodden look of resignation.&nbsp;  And now for the crazy stuff, if you are ever in Vegas and a really pretty girl comes to talk to you, she does NOT like you, but it is entertaining to mess with them; tell them that you are a gay man who is broke and they will drop you like third period French, if they want my money they are going to have to try to work a lot harder than that.&nbsp; If you ever get out there try a place called the Areole, it has a two story glass wine bin (some chick actually hooks up to this thing and flies up and down to get your wine which you get to watch while eating dinner) and a digital wine list on a touch screen pc tablet, it is way cool, has food that tasted like paradise and it has great scenery (no not the decor). &nbsp;&nbsp;For the first couple hours I thought it was interesting how all the fathers brought their daughters on vacation out here, but this is not Arkansas and they only relationship they had with them was via Ben Franklin.  &nbsp;And now for a few personal dedications, PMAC- thanks for teaching me that just because you can does not mean you should, you saved me so many times (when are you getting married?&nbsp; You ought to go someplace cool like Hawaii, I may be going out there for one other wedding already). Tone- Thanks for giving me rhythm, I now know that I’m too legit to quit, I also still think I look cool playing guitar&nbsp; AJ- Sorry about your car door—It shouldn’t have been standing there, just ask all my guy friends, if its the worst thing that I ever do to you then you just got unlucky.&nbsp; Cook- You make me so proud, when did you become Don Juan, and be careful, you will get caught and I will be there with a lawn chair, a six pack and laugh as I &nbsp;watch the carnage.&nbsp; Heidi- Watch out for those doors marked “do not enter” they really mean it.&nbsp; Ike- Thanks for giving me a buddy to shoot assault rifles with, even though neither one of us can afford it anymore; now you will learn how to stitch up all the poor bastards we shot (We all planned to come out and visit you but I’m not sure I want to let Brandon fly me again, one near death experience is enough).&nbsp; Also, tell your sister hi for me, jk. Lauren- Sorry about your bathroom, I swear I do not remember a thing but your floor was about the coolest place in the world at that point in time.  This summer I got to go to the rangers and have box seats and access to the press box and club house (that’s the locker room), it was way cool to hang out with the team and I got a bunch of free stuff, always a bonus (although naked baseball players seem to be completely comfortable talking to you while flopping in the breeze, and I do mean flopping).&nbsp; And for the best part I got to kick it with Matt Damon at the movie theatre, albeit briefly- it was way cool and he is not as tall as you would think.&nbsp; For the goofiest story of the summer, I got lost the first week I was living in downtown, I kid you not I drove around for 45 minutes, I could see my building (right beneath the white ball in downtown) but could not get to it because all of the damn one way streets, it was sooo frustrating. I confused the crap out of a bum on a park bench; I must have past him 12 times, his expression was pure comedy  &nbsp;For the things I have learned in Dallas  1- Drive like you are running from the police- the crazier the better  2- Dallas cops do not have a sense of humor  3- The downtown YMCA is a great place to work out and throw out the vibe; avoid the locker rooms at all costs  4- Always carry a dollar in your pocket for the poor, but never stop walking and never pull out your wallet.  5- If you are pasty white and you ever have a rooftop pool and you take off your shirt while visiting, expect a chuckle or two.  6- Realize that there are a lot of really stupid people out there, do all of us a favor and try to hit them with your car, preferably going over 80 and yell something about thinning out the gene pool as you drive off.  7- Never go to a bar alone just for the heck of it, you will be an instant target for every loner in the world, but do go to the magnolia theatre even if you are alone.  8- Go to the Dallas Museum of art and hang out for a day, it is good for the soul and will show you how creative people can be and that you to could get paid for some of the doodles that you draw while wasting time at work.  9- Never tell your boss that you think he is an ibid, they would rather be insulted than confused.  10- Tattoos are gross, piercing is weird, smoking is unattractive and everyone in Dallas usually has and does all three.  11- Go to the grassy knoll  12- Do not go to a bar called the bone (what happened at the bone stays at the bone)  13- Go skydiving  14- Men are stupid; and women are&nbsp;crazy (that came from a girl so no complaining)  15- If you feel sorry for yourself or think life has been unfair to you drive to downtown at midnight, if you are still convinced you have a bad life you will probably end up right and as an added bonus you are stupid.  16- If you are gay in Oklahoma you are not really gay  17- If she looks 25 and acts like she is 35 she is damn near 50, if she looks 25 and acts like she is twenty she is damn near 12.&nbsp;  18- Get a dog (dogs rule cats drool)  19- It is not humid in Oklahoma  20- and lastly (drum roll in the background)- Accountants are sexy, and how do we all know this?&nbsp; Because now you know one.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for my Deloitte buddies, you gotta try this stuff.  1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call the guy in the cube next to you and tell him that you are too busy to talk right now and promptly hang up.  2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right before lunch get up and sprint around your office at top speed, sit down and tell anyone who asks that you were stretching for lunch.  3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring a puppet to office meetings and ask it to clarify any difficult points  4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spill coffee on the conference table. Produce a little paper boat and sail it down the table.  5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a meeting, each time the boss makes an important point, (or at least one he/she seems to consider important), make a little noise like you are building up to an orgasm.  6-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groan out loud in the toilet cubicle, this is funny, esp. when the guy gets up and leaves bc you scare him.  7-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignore the first five people who say 'good morning' to you.  8-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Babble incoherently at a fellow employee then ask, "Did you get all that, I don't want to have to repeat it".  9-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page yourself over the intercom (do not disguise your voice).&nbsp;  10-While your office mate is at lunch, move his chair into the elevator   Well guys, this letter has gotten way to long and I should probably get back to work (yep I just got paid to write thisJ).&nbsp; Keep it real, have a spectacular week and if you ever get thru Dallas my door is always open if I’m in town.&nbsp; Catch you all on the flip side and “life moves pretty fast, if you don’t take the time to stop and look around every once in a while you just might miss it”. Lastly, if you see a black and chrome motorcycle with a cool looking dude riding around with a miniature dachshund hanging out on the backseat with goggles on honk at me and wave (although I wouldn’t)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Get busy Living or get busy dying”,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;TNT

      The idea of creating a blog was about as appealing to me as heading to abercrombie to pick up a pair of jeans and then enjoying a cappucino at the local starbucks.&nbsp; However, moving to a new town and going through a sibling with brain cancer has led me to look for different avenues in life within which to express myself.&nbsp; I look around now and see a bunch of people struggling to get to work and keep up there payments for the BMW sitting in the driveway.&nbsp; 1 day wasted,&nbsp;1 day less with a loved one,&nbsp;1 more 24 hour period that we as a society have become so efficient at wasting.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder&nbsp;if that when I'm 80 if I will look back on my life as a journey or as trial that&nbsp;I passed through as an unknowning defendant with a&nbsp;predetermined verdict and a crooked judge.&nbsp; We all face the same sentence no matter who, what or how good we think we are.&nbsp; So do we smile back and ignore the shackles we have been born with or "take arms against a sea of troubles".
