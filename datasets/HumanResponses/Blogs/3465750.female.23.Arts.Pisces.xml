      After a marathon session lasting from 1PM to 3AM I have finished draft one of "Alive..." I am mourning my method of ending the book but it is for a greater purpose. Now begins the process of abandoning it for the next day or two while I reflect. I will begin editing Monday.   To those two beauties, Eve and Binks, I thank you for your reading of this rough draft and for allowing me to share this with you. Your encouragement has been a sustaining force for me while I bleed this one through. I hope that you will be happy with the ending but also angry that I have chosen to allow such suffering in my characters.   I will be with you all again shortly on more thoughts but for now my brain needs to sleep.

      It may seem arrogant of me to be posting a blog on a book that has no confirmation of being published nor even an agent. I am a first time writer with absolutely no past creds and I am beating away at the keys, a mile a minute most nights, pouring out a story that I have been trying to tell for the past four years. I don't recall when exactly or why I started the book that I had called "Riven" from the very beginning. Perhaps it was because I wanted to tell a story of love that I'd never have, with my cynicism interlaced with my penchant for the darkness. Or could it have been that I was tired of reading stories that had no clear conclusion, no originality, and no substance? Or could it have been that I have this inkling in me that I knoew I can do better? Arrogance has always been a subdued but very present aspect in me and I am not afraid to hide it now. The concept of "Riven" has been born new. At this very moment the three book (or more) series gestates within me, waiting to be brought painfully into the world. For there is a lot of pain in this story, the main characters have to feel it. If they were happy, then there would be nothing to say. Of course, they are supernatural. I don't like normal. It doesn't taste right.   I have spent the last few days carving out the rough, rough, rough draft of the reinstated series after a year in hiatus. I am now on chapter 15. The working title is now "Alive, in Death" it is a pretentious title and it won't remain. I don't want it to. I don't like it but all things must have names. From the very beginning, so says "the great Book," that wo/mankind named all the creatures on earth. Why shouldn't a project so close to my heart have a name as well? Even if it will be changed...  It shall have a name and so I sayeth "Alive, in Death." Does it mean anything? Those who have read the opening sequence of events understand. Those who are reading this are probably the ones who have read this piece of my heart that hangs open and bleeding.   Alas, it is not as personal as I let on. I have an entirely new concept. As Eve Alacu of Asy9 states on her site: "darkness, death, greed, deadly sins, Jesus, faith, angels, vampires, poison, drugs, sex, music, and so much more." Have I become a convert? Hardly. I have read the Left Behind series with abandon. I love Terry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye for their concern and love that was put into the series. But will I ever believe the message? Unless millions disappear in one simultaneous second, some probably before my very eyes for I am a sinner in theirs, I will hold to my steadfast believe that God is a blind creation of man's greatest moment of need for validation. However, I am deeply fascinated with the concept of religion. I am also deep into the belief that if there is a God who has created a race of beings that we fondly know as man and woman, why should Satan not have created a race of his own? Why not a race derrived of that very being that he had once been? "Evil Angels?" You ask, "Why?"  Why not? Just because they have a spark of the divine does not mean they can't fall prey to the appetites of man. No being is ever perfect. If you are told otherwise, sorry to say but you need to do some more studying on world history. All eggs go bad eventually.   Sadly I will not give out much about the project at this time. Once I have neared my completion I will be able to post a chapter upon my yet-to-be constructed site. I hope by then to have an agent who is interested in putting as much into this book as I am now. If not, there is always rogue publishing. Yes, I believe that much. Any financiers interested in contributing should go through the proper channels of my site when it is launched in order to find what needs to be done to help this cause. But I am getting ahead of myself.   My lovely friend Eve whom I have come to respect and admire over the past few months has informed me that after reading the opening strains of "Alive..." the work has become the Muse (I liken it to Terpsichore) for her latest project "Forlorn." She says on Asy9.com in her journal: "so what's with "forlorn"?  daevina's writing a book. I have to say it's purely inspiring, and mostly smut (she would smile). but it brings a few things to mind; oh, alright, more than just a few..... several things. darkness, death, greed, deadly sins, Jesus, faith, angels, vampires, poison, drugs, sex, music, and so much more. with all of these visions, I can't help but reply. so with "forlorn" I will cut a path with my little scissors.... 'til I come to a dead stop. walk behind me. I'll let you. if you promise to not look back....."   I must say that I was humbled nearly to tears when I recieved the e-mail that informed me of her intentions and I am eager to know the outcome of whatever this book has evoked within her. I only hope that she will not be disappointed when she finds out how I will end the series. Let me just say that I don't do happy endings. I don't do neat little packages tied up carefully to ensure it all fits into the box. Conflict is my passion, my love. I have always admired its ability to take a beautiful moment and turn it upside down. It is a necessary variable in order for the balance to exist for the greater good of the whole. But I am ahead again.   For now I close with the hopes that you will follow me on this journey. I fear it but I love it just the same. It is a grand experiment to see if my stamina will hold out. Will yours?

      It's been virtually impossible to stay away from this book but I have to say that it's literally a part of me now. I am dreaming of the characters some nights, talking to them in my head like they have been born as whole people. I don't know if that's a sign that I should get into therapy or if it's a normal thing for any author. I imagine if one is to spend time literally inventing a person with a history and hopes and dreams that you have complete control over... for it is only with the shift of a few keys that you are able to turn their world upside down.... It is bound to come back to you on some subconscious level.   There is a lot of research going into this novel. A lot of thought, foresight, and effort to make elements of this story real. I don't like doing things half way and my head is swimming with history. History of a world I have never seen nor will ever see. I mourn that sometimes, to have been alive during the Middle Age and see what it was really like. What a gift. But since this is such a minor part of the story at this moment, I am not troubling over it too much. Perhaps I will in a later endeavor if I buy into that prequel concept.   I want to give a big thanks to those of you who are impatiently awaiting what the revisions will bring to this. An even bigger thanks goes to those who I have been mercilessly teasing with this book. I know I tell you I will be done soon but every time I open the files I see something else to add or subtract. I am just glad these are not real people but their body parts would be scattered about in disarray while I put them back together again. Humpty Dumpty?? Good story. Very true in this case.   H.I.M. is blaring in my ears right now and I'm at a loss. I don't know if I want to write tonight or if I want to leave it alone. I imagine I'll jump back into it in a moment or two. It's an addiction now and my veins and fingertips burn. So much to say. So much to feel. So much to learn.

      Well what do you know. I forgot to even sit down and write in this because I've been so busy doing... guess what? Writing "Forlorn." I am on the f-i-n-a-l revision now and have several places in mind for which to send it to. One is a subsidy publisher that will make me pay to put it out. The other is an agent some place in California who does no charge but more or less reads the story, tells you if it's bunk, and if it's not bunk they will try to hook you up with a publishing deal. At least that is the sense I get. Eitherway everyone is telling me that they will die of absolute shock if this book isn't picked up by a legit company and sadly, I am egotistical enough to agree. Originality will do that to a person.   Anyway, I'm going back to writing the rest of this. But I am still here. I haven't left yet!
