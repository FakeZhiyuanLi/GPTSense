       Tradition   Every Halloween week, since I could remember, I've always watch the Peanuts Special on the Great Pumpkin.  Long live Sparky.  Your cartoons are still great.  I hope that I will spend time watching the Halloween and Christmas specials with my kids some day.  Or at least with my wife.

       Bridge School Benefit   Big Sur, Bridge School, and San Francisco were all great this weekend.  We had a fun night of frolicking drunk in the trees and then woke up with pounding heads yet happy hearts.  We even saw zebras on the roadside yet I think they were only zonkeys.  We ate outside the entrance of a Ralphs and looked liked vagrants to the old women with their stink faces and evil eyes.  The Bridge School show had awful sound but there were some cool parts.  Wilco was great, they played to Woody Guthrie songs, including Jesus Christ for President, and three of their own.  Counting Crows was ok, they covered Friend of the Devil by the Grateful Dead.  Pearl Jam was awesome. I am officially back on the PJ train after that show.  They sounded the best and brought the best mojo to the show.  They opened with the most haunting version of Dylan's Masters of War that I've ever heard, and then went to couple of their own songs.  They then then played 25 seconds to go by Cash and I nearly jumped out of my pants.  Mass repect to PJ for that.  Then Willie Nelson came on and he was completely stoned.  It was a great set.  CSN&Y finished things off and were great as well.  We then drove to our hotel room and happened to cover inch of floorspace that was available except the tub.   We woke up and went to San Francisco to walk a lot and eat bad Chinese food.  We then road back to SoCal on our horses to see the hills on fire.  I know so many people affected by these fires.  I know a couple guys in Simi, five in the mist of the San Diego blazes, and about 10 families in the Big Bear/Arrowhead/Crestline area.  It's incredible to think that so much of the mountains in San Bernadino are gone and entire towns could be wiped out.  I'm going to be praying a lot today.  I think a lot of people are.    I'm going to get comments on this site soon.

       Big Sur   Tomorrow I'm going to Big Sur to camp before the   urlLink Bridge School Benefit  show on Saturday.  I did this last year and the time spent was incredible.  It should be a fun go around this time as well.             urlLink

       I Hate This Computer   I'm writing to y'all from a broken, open computer that only seems to want to turn on once every twenty times I try.  So I'll make things quick.  Updates: 1) Got a girlfriend, seriously.  She's great, she's cute.  I'm lucky.  I don't want to screw this up.  2) I thought I was working for Best Buy but they never call to work.  They're all flakes. Now I'm trying to go Radio Shack.  If Best Buy doesn't want me, I'll go straight to their competition.  3) I got an interview with this shady company that I soon found out was  a pyramid scheme.  I spent most of the day in Oxnard trying to sell electronics items at wholesale prices.  I felt like I was scaming people.  I probably was.  Still looking for honest work.  4) A couple of my friends are now in jail, in Oregon.  It's a crazy situation.  More on this later.  Other than this stuff, life is still the same in Burbank.  Boring.  I need to win the Lottery.  So I could travel and open a nice bar.  I'd called it O'Sycz's.  I know, it's not that catchy.

       G.I. Joe Mama   My friend Kristin sent me this  urlLink link  where somebody dubbed over G.I. Joe public service annoucements.  I'm warning you right now that before you click on any of these clips, you should should use the proper facilities because you will piss your pants.  You have been warned.

       Old Zoo   My sister Jen took me to the  urlLink Old Zoo  in Griffith Park yesterday.  I always wanted to see it because I heard about the old cages there ffrom the 1930s and all the old tagging.  I was disappointed to see the Parks Services paint over all the graffii.  So if you feel marking some walls and cages up, I would encourage you to go with some friends and have at it there.  The sis and I did hike a lot in the hills and ventured around other areas of the park that I haven't seen for years.    It's really cold in house right now.  My room, since it is an old addition, doesn't have proper insulation and I can usually see my own breath in the mornings.  I think I'm going to fire up the portable heater to keep me warm tonight.  But I can't complain.  This weather is way better than 100 degree heat.

       Halloweener   I went down to Whittier for all pagan's day.  And as a long standing tradition, I disappointed myself with my lack of effort in my choice of costume.  I paid $15 for the worst priest outfit I could find and had a holy water container filled with whiskey.  The guys at the bayou decided to throw a small party that turned into a rockin bash.  If you can imagine a party being thrown in New York subway at rush hour, you can how much personal space was being violated there.  I got to chill and talk with some good people, drink a little and then close out the party at 2am.  I woke up 8am, drank some coffee, and hang out with my Ryan as he was hung over on the other(bigger) couch at the Bayou.  I didn't envy him, I've been in his shoes many times before.  Soon after that, hung out and ate at Nimo's, and then cleaned up the house.  After that, O'Brien noticed that there was an garage under the house that was locked and we preceeded, with Andy, to break the lock and discover what treasures we had.  Through the dank, dusty, cludured space we found many dead spiders, and old furniture.  It ends up the space was keeping things left behind by the owner's deceased mother.  There was some old 78s in there so all was not lost.  It would have been better there was some gold in there.  Or at least some old clothing of the male persuation that would fit me.  After that I cleaned up, and saw a movie with my friend Kristin and her roommates.  It was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  It wasn't the best movie in the world but I had good company.  After that I hung out with O'Brien, and then went home.  Good times, good people.

       Don't worry....  Nothing Really Happened        Nothing has really happened since the last post.  No job.  I have of applications out there but they probably won't be read til at least January 5.  I can tell you that manager at the Big 5 in Burbank is a jerk.  Don't go there.  But if you do go, make sure to ask for Victor and give him a sealed envelope in which there is a diploma which says, "Victor of Big 5 is hereby declared a Complete Ass."  I think he will like that.  Make sure to congradulate him and shake his hand.  And if you are an employer, please be kind to the people that are trying to find work with your company.  They have feelings and ambitions just like you.  Because you never know if that person you spit on today, will be your new employer in the future.  And if you care to do so, I'm apply at my old alma mater for a position in the admissions department and would like your prayers .  In my own eyes, I feel that I'm very qualified to take on the job, seeing that I've worked in the admissions department for a year, I know the school like the back of my hand, I've given so much of my time to Biola through service and even promoting the school, but you never know what can happen.  I've been shut out of much lesser positions(Wells Fargo is hereby declared a Complete Ass), and many, many doors have been shut in my face.        My girlfriend is in China for 6 weeks and I miss her terribly.  It's nice that I still talk to her on the phone but it's very rarely that I do because of the expense.  She will be coming back on January 22.  I can't wait.  I hate patience.        So I hope that all your Christmas/Hanukuah/Kwanzaa wishes came through and that the New Year will be good.  I hope mine will be better.

       My Curse   I think that I'm cursed.  The curse that is upon me is one that prevents me from obtaining employment.  I know that there are jobs out there.  I apply for a lot of them.  I never get them.  Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.  Maybe I should start my own crime syndicate.  Start with petty crime at first and then move my way up to extortion and assasination jobs.  Or maybe not.  Maybe being a cop is not that bad of an idea.

       The Day After   Yesterday, I had my second interview with Biola and it went well.  Though I don't really expect to get hired.  The other interviewees seemed much more adapted to that kind of work.  Hopefully I'm just fooling myself.    I pick up Kristin from the airport today, hopefully.  I worry that the flight might delayed because her visa in China ran out yesterday and that can pose some problems for her departure.  Though when I hear her voice from SFO I'll be feeling better.  Hopefully someone other than myself is reading this because none of my friends are being updated.  And no one has responded my posts for about a month.  Maybe I should post a question to the internet masses?  What is your favorite cartoon of all-time?  Let's see if that works.  [Listening to Blur's 13]

       Big Day Tomorrow   I got an interview with Biola tomorrow.  It's a group interview, which I hate, but at least I get shot at working there.  It would be nice to get it.  I hope it's ment to be.  I'm a little nervous right now thinking about it.  Throw one up to the Almighty if you care.  I need some prayer, some help.

       New Computer   I just got a new computer and boy am I happy with it.  I switched over to the PC side this time.  The speed on this thing great.  It's like going from a 1984 Oldsmobile Omega to a Ferrari.  And I can burn CDs! Now all I need is a job.

       Why My Money Will Go to APU   As some of you already know, I've been going through an employment application process at Biola for about two months.  I was applying for the position of Undergraduate Admissions Counselor.    I've worked in the admissions department before as a student so I knew exactly what I was getting into.  And I must say, the times that I was called in to interview, as a member of a group, and as an individual, were pleasant.  The people who work in department are so nice and I felt like we were communicating well with each other.  I also took a clerical test twice, which was expected, and I entertained a number of phone calls which I tried to be very helpful and make their job easier as they tried to pick the right person for the job.    I get a letter in the mail on Wednesday from Biola and I knew immediately that they chose not to hire me.  To be honest, I was sad and bummed.  That soon passed because things like that happen all the time and I've gotten so use to rejection from a number of other opportunities.    The letter states:(With typos intact)    Dear Michael Sycz:  Thank you for interviewing for Undergraduate Admissions Counselor position here at Biola University.  We appreciate the time you spent with us.  However, it has been determined that other candidates more closely meet the needs of this position.  Again, thank you for your communication with us and we wish you the very best as you consider a change in your employment situation.  Sincerely' (name withheld)   Now, I was expecting a letter like this.  It's fine. Life goes on.  I'm meant to be somewhere else.  Fast forward to Friday afternoon and I get a call on my cellphone from the head of the admissions department.  She's calling to say thank you and pretty much tell me why they didn't hire me.    As a person who has been through many, many interviews, I thought this was excellent.  An employer was going to give me constructive criticism and I was going to find out what I didn't have or what I did wrong as to prevent me from getting the job.   Please forgive me for not knowing exactly, quote for quote, was said but the statement went something like this.  Head Admissions Lady:    I just wanted to tell you Michael that it has been a pleasure talking with you and we appreciate your participation in this interview process.  But we have decide that we are not going to hire anyone right now.  The department is in a state of flux right now and is going through a lot of changes.    I was silent.  I managed to thank her for calling me but a fire was soon growing in me.  After I hung up, my initial thoughts were of anger.  You mean you're not hiring anybody?  I drove from Burbank to La Mirada for nothing?  Are you saying I never had a chance in the first place?  And that not only did you waste my time but the time of 12 other people applying.  And also the monetary loss that was wasted on this "non-application process."  I wonder how much student money is wasted like that on a yearly basis at old BU?  Who decided to not hire at the position after wanting to before hand?    It took me awhile to come out of that anger ball I was in.  In fact the anger that I had almost ruined my weekend with my girlfriend.    So another story for the books.  Another bad Biola experience.  They seem to be more frequent now.  That University.......  You know what?  Biola is not a University.  In name only, maybe.  From here on I'm calling it the Institute.  That's what it is.  It's run like one.    Though the one great thing that came out of this fiasco is the fact that I was saved from working at a place that I probably would have hated.  I also contacted a place in which I interviewed at before hand and got another interview that took place on Friday.   urlLink A place  were they help people out of debt and NOT rip them off.  In La Mirada.  A place I would love to work at because I would be helping people.  Helping people is my passion.    So hopefully I may be employed again very soon.  Or maybe not.  God only knows.    Anyways, if you want to go to Biola, email me and I'll tell you why you shouldn't.  And this is coming from someone who was "Mr Biola."  I was VP, did mission trips, produced the news programs on campus, did radio, spoke in chapel, and found out what really goes on behind the scenes.     *UPDATE*  I got the job at the Debt consolidation place.  I start work Monday.

       Update   So I didn't get this job at Biola.  They just strung me along for a ride for about two months before I saw the mail this morning and received a letter finally telling me that I'm not good enough.  They could have at least called me and saved themselves 34 cents.    My money situation is very bad right now and I'm continuing my job search with the direction of applying at as many school districts as I can.  I should be able to get a job as a substitute.  Anything to get me out of this house.    In other news, Maddux is a Cub again.  I would write more about this but life sucks too much.

       Writing from Work   I'm writing from my desk at work(it's lunch), and all is good.  I hard a really hard weekend, with a problem finally being resolved last night.  That's all I'll say.  It's funny much of an idoit I can be sometimes.  Though when I finally get my head out my ass, I'm alright.  You live, you learn.

      I'm doing better.  Patience is the key.  That and prayer.  Work is boring right now. Nothing to do.  Office jobs suck.  I need to get out.  I want to travel right now.  Asia sounds good. Africa too.  Maybe I'll try the peace core.  Anything to get out of here.

      I feel wronged.  I know I did everything that I could have possibly done in my relationship with Kristin to make things work.  To show her how much I love her and care for her.  I wonder if I was in her situation and she was in mine would she would do the same as I did for her?  Was I fooled? Was I blind to what was really going on?  Was I taken advantage of?  And what do I do now? Do I continue to love her as before?  Should I wait?  There is a battle in me fighting for what would be right and good and for what God wants me to do.  She said that God revealed to her that we are not suppose to be together.  Why didn't He tell me this?  In fact, I felt God told me the exact opposite.  I cannot reconcile this in my head or my heart.    So do I protect my heart or risk it being tortured some more?  I've been told a lot of different things and I don't know who to believe.  I almost wish that she cheated on me or found someone else or any number of other reasons that could have happened.  At least I could deal with that.    She still has my heart.  And I don't want it back.

       How It Started   When I was 7 or 8 years old, I loved to throw a racket ball against our chimney outside and play catch with myself.  I spent hours at a time doing this. Using a glove I've had for about 4 years at that point, I worked on my hand-eye coordination to prepare for little league.  One day I was playing just as i have been many days before and threw it in such a way that i bounced that racket ball into the alley right behind our house.  Now, i have done this many times before hand but this day was different.  i went to retrieve the ball and noticed at black audio tape right against the wall of the karate studio that was the other side of the alley.   I venture over 20 feet out of my way and pick up this tape that is says, " The Who - Who's Last".

      wow. I haven't posted in a long time.    I have been pretty busy at work yet there have been plenty of times to write.  It's just hard to start writing when you have not done it in awhile.   I've been reading a lot about Satchel Paige lately.  Someone needs to make a movie about him.  This Saturday will be six months since I started dating Kristin.  In hindsight, comparing these last six months to the one's previous, is like comparing night and day.  I can't believe how lucky I am.

      Do you ever go through some days that you suddenly feel the weight of everything in your world come down on you?  Days that seem if one brick in the wall that you trying to build is not there that your whole world is going to fall?  I felt that around 10:30pm tonight.    I start my EMT classes on the 17th of August, which is conducted on every Tuesday and Thursday from 5pm to 9:30pm.  And it looks like, because of the schedule, that I will not be able attend Matt's Wedding.  I can't miss a class.    I'm also waiting to see if I get a substitute teaching job in Whittier.  This will(God willing) provide my income to live in the Whittier area.    It would be awesome for all this to work out.

      to WiFi, or not to pirate WiFi? i can remember times when i was little that we had cable tv for free. my dad would sneak over to my neighbors house while they were gone, throw a splitter on their cable line, and manage to hide the fact from them for years.  so now, faced with a similar chance, without all the sneaking around... should i continue to sneak onto the WiFI network i find in my new building, or should i just let the charter communications guy actually install the internet for me when he gets here tomorrow? free internet... or $50 a month for internet and cable tv, what's a guy to choose?  in other thoughts, i think the porch here is great. maybe would could throw up a couple of pics of some humming birds, gloyds ramshakle plants, a couple of cigarettes, and a crazy durnken neighbor or two just to make the place feel like home.  anyway, its good to have a computer again. let the blogging commence.  ps. there was a fire in my aparment today on comstock while i was out. three fire trucks... more to that story later. now i gotta sleep.

       the following email is from andrew hamilton...   Gentlemen:  Please excuse any misspellings, exaggerations, or otherwise eccentric behavior.   I am drinking  the whiskey.  First, the Bayou is a Bayou no longer. The mighty magnolia has fallen; no shade falls on the sacred roof; the tender semen smell laces the cool morning air no more; the leaves do not litter the path; possums do not swing, nor waddle, nor twitch; and the landlord's grandmother turns in her grave. Perhaps she waits for the troubadour, Jesse Gloyd, and his promises of evening love for the dead, as strummed on a bandaged guitar.  Or,   Perhaps not.  One thing we know for sure. The Bayou, as we have known it, is gone. Much too much pale light changes the atmosphere; no better, no worse, only changed.  In other news, Iraq has been returned its sovereignty, Michael Moore continues to prove his stupidity on a national scale, and a new Bevmo has officially opened in Pasadena. And yet there remain those who doubt the existence of a God.  Disagreements:  Jesse: In continuation of our real time porch conversation of last night, and picking up the pieces of this virtual one, David Fricke, despite his (what you call) boyish, and (what I call) frighteningly preserved and (ultimately) bizarre looks, is definitely not our generation's Greil Marcus. Greil Marcus is first and foremost a social scientist. He is a semiologist who bridges pop culture and philosophy. He is a connection-maker by trade, signifying the hitherto mundane or merely factual. David Fricke is a music critic, albeit a usually very good one; with the exception of his wasting 5 stars on Adrock and the After School Crew. Greil Marcus on the other hand, is a critical theorist, much like Lester Bangs, Roland Barthes, and David Hickey.   There is, my dear boy, a difference.  Of course, too be fair, the only writings I have read of David Fricke are those in his tiny column in RS. He (usually) has good taste in music. He (according to the blurb in italics, apparently) has been to more shows than I have. I am sure that the 500 words he gets per month are not a qualitative sampling of his thoughts on pop culture as we know it, and, were he to have a few books, or even a longer section, I might change my mind. But, until he convinces me otherwise, I will not hold him as my generation's Greil Marcus. Instead, I pass that mantel on to either Nick Hornby, or Jon Singleton. Whom, come to think of it, are probably closer to Greil Marcus's generation. So, oh well.  On to other thoughts...  Old Music or New Music?  Is there anything worth listening to these days?   Do they make it like they used too?   Can there be such a thing as new music, given the range and subconscious influence of music history?   Considering the existence of the blues, has there ever been any such thing as New Music?   If there is such a thing as New Music, that is, music that has no place, only new, nothing to tether it to the long corridors of tradition and influence, music that uses nothing that anyone has ever used before, if there is this New Music, what does it sound like?        Ok.  Enough.  I am getting a little big for my britches, a little dogmatic.  After all, there is so much goodness to be enjoyed, why question it?   As long as it makes you want to   a) scream b) cry c) smile d) quiver or e) motherfuckingdance!  it's ok with me.  In other  news...  Andy: I continue to pray for you.  Matt: You too.  A & M: Don't get discouraged. No matter how many teenage love handles you see, never forget that while you are being paid (albeit ten dollars a day, or whatever), to travel around the country and play the rock and roll, some other people don't get to do that. Not that some people mind that much. No, but seriously, I can understand why you guys might get discouraged, and I'll be praying for you. That must be draining.  Matt: Is there a concrete plan for your B.P.? If no, do you want there to be? J-Glo and me gots plenty of time on our hands, if you want a plan to be in the works. Also, I heard about the rehearsal dinner situation with your mom. I am sorry, and I am praying for you too.   Jesse: I have nothing to say to you. Oh wait, yes I do. Thanks for the CDs. Bill Evans kicks so much ass. I am burning you some selections from my collections that you might appreciate.  And, I am officially tapped out. I take my last drag of cigarette,                                             , pat Matt on the fur coated shoulder, (pat-pat), pee in the dark because I believe the light bulb is burned out in the bathroom again,           , and, collapse into a bed writhing with Sylvia fleas. Good night boys...  -Andrew  P.S. Jesse, I read today that white sage is an ancient aphrodisiac. Supposedly, if you bottle the smoke and then sniff it through a straw, it will make you very, very "potent," if you know what I mean. You should try it.  P.P.S. A&M: Mustaches? Are you mustachioed? Oh god I hope so...  kisses,  a.

I enjoy the folks in these here parts, but Hawaii is Hawaii.  In almost cool news, as many of you know, I missed eating next to Sir Willie Nelson in the little Mauian town of Paia by twenty frigging minutes.  My mom blessed her self with the condensation left by his water glass.  Oye vey.  I'm about to make my July music mix.  I'll post a setlist when I'm finished.  Jesse

      I found this site called  urlLink Ship of Fools  awhile back.  It's the first online church.  There a special service today that was actually by Tony Campolo.  He had some very interesting  urlLink things  to say about the state of America today.  It was pretty good.  God is officially on the internet.

      I posted some fun pictures on  urlLink my blog  that you may want to check out. i need to admit something.  i'm jealous of people younger than me that are successful.  in a week i'll will be turning 24.  orson wells beat me.  bastard.  you know who it is?  it's the wellses, joe nuxalls, lebron jameses, etc.etc.etc.  who kill me.  i'm over it.   i'm drinking nestle hot cocoa.  does a body good. lately, i've been apatheic/cut to the heart (do the math on that one).  i'm all set to either:  move to spain, get a real job around here, do nothing and sub, sub and write, take a poop.  all bets are on.  3:1 odds on the last one. trying not a make out, get drunk, smoke, say 'f' words, talk about girls sex parts, and buy crap.  thought it might be a good idea. lola and sylvia meow all the time and eat food.  they are boring.  they nap.  i will smart bomb them. there is a wilco egg on the desk. a cork too. and a straw. 10:1 that on Thursday Super Jesse will appear and use his super cleaning powers to vanquish filth and restore order to the Bayou.  Righting the Havoc that was wrecked by his cleaning arch-nemisis, me. peace, ya'll. eat some donuts for Princeton U. and while you're at it smoke that corn cob like there's no tomorrow. There really is, but don't tell anyone, ok, holmes? OK?!  Times Square would like to wear underwear but it's an imposible feat. a square wouldn't dare because it's not fair to the people walking on its streets. because they like to see its wee wee. aka pee pee.   ah, what a special nyc treat!

      Hey guys, I just finished  The Idiot  by Dostoevsky. Good book. It was a long read, and it tied together in the end with a lot of unanswered/unanswerable questions. Jesse, glad to hear that things are going well in Hawii. The sea urchin thing is a bummer. Anyone up for a weekend camping trip in the near future?

           it's been said, and heard by many of us, those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it.... or something to that extent. well friends i think that we are (aside from religious beliefs) looking at another sign of the end of the american civilization.  i was listening to  urlLink studio 360 , a program on  urlLink npr , this last weekend and i heard something that got me thinking about this. let me start out by saying that this didn't really shock me perse, but it made realize that are group of friends is once again an acception to the rule.  the full text of this commentary can be found at  urlLink this link . but here are some highlights from kurt anderson's piece:   We all saw the recent news stories about the big decline in the percentage of Americans who read fiction or poetry or drama. Back in 1982, a large majority of people said they read a work of literature that year. And now, just two decades later, it's less than half that.  Reading fiction – any kind of fiction, from Jackie Collins to Stephen King to Philip Roth – has officially become a minority taste in America .  What's more, this decline appears to be accelerating – nearly the entire drop occurred in just the last decade.  The new study was undertaken by the National Endowment for the Arts. And Dana Gioia, the clear-eyed poet and former businessman who runs the NEA, says what we are witnessing is “a general collapse in advanced literacy.” He calls it a “national crisis.”   check out the link and read the whole thing. it's scary. in fact here's the scariest thing in there...  The historian and author Kevin Starr was quoted in the New York Times as saying that this glass looked half full to him – nearly 100 million American adults still reading poetry and fiction and drama.  “ In an age where we're returning to medieval-like oral culture based on television ,” Professor Starr said, “I think that's pretty impressive.”

      Hi again...   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sitting in Poppo and Grandma's condo.&nbsp; We just finished eating and watching some ESPN.&nbsp; Bed is on the horizon, as we are going snorkeling very early tomorrow.&nbsp; I went surfing this afternoon and jogging with Robyn.&nbsp; I got her some running shoes for her birthday.&nbsp; We went to a luau last night.&nbsp; A man ate fire.&nbsp; We ate pig.&nbsp; It was fun.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also recovering from stepping on a sea urchin while falling off my board.&nbsp; It looked a lot nastier than it felt.&nbsp; Like a porcupine.&nbsp; Pictures to follow.&nbsp; I tried to pee on it, but it's kind of hard to hold your foot over the toilet and pee on it (try, you'll see what I mean).&nbsp; I soaked it in vinegar instead.&nbsp; My mom then picked out the pieces with an unsanitary needle.&nbsp; I acted like a baby and bitched and yelled at her.&nbsp; Everyone made fun of me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dodgers have won 17 of 19.&nbsp; Rumor has it, Randy Johnson has said he would wave his no trade to play for the Blue Crew.&nbsp;  Surprised By Joy  is pretty fantastic.&nbsp; C.S. Lewis is still a nerd.&nbsp; Local Hawaiian food is very good.&nbsp; Ask Sycz, he'll vouch.&nbsp; See everyone Thursday.   -Jesse

      I just bought  A Century Ends . Amazing ablum. I think you especially would love it, O'Brien. Hey, I'll burn it for you as a contribution to the "O'Brien got his music stolen" collection. Anyway, the woman and I just broke up (mutual), and here is a song that I think is amazing. Don't worry, I'm not too heavy hearted over it.  Gathering Dust  I got no reason but that I must maybe I feel like I've been gathering dust I must leave this harbour for the sea I'm too young to settle down and make a home But I don't know where I'm wanting to be I just know I have to be there alone  Stole my time, all my time stole my time, for you  Pale winter sun is beatin' the ground why 'm I throwin' away  the best thing that I've found My young heart's in tatters and I'm sure that it will be a long time healing it's so hard to see what I'm doing this for when loneliness is all that I'm feeling  Stole my time, all my time, spend my time, for you  chorus: Now the wind it is blowing blowing leaves from the trees I've got no use knowing that with time it'll ease I don't know where I'm going hope I get there soon cos my soul is hollow as the sorrowful moon na na na na...  The night is raining on my weary head Taking me back  See the sun spread its wings of gold as the dawn unfurls Hear the song that the moon sings to the darkened world Feel the fire lighting in the bitter cold It's like the light that shines through the windows of your soul

      in honor of those of us who are near the sea, or those of us (me) who dreamed about it last night, here's a fun one that jangly old gloyd will want played 24/7 in 70 years when he is in a nursing home   PIRATE LOOKS AT FORTY  -  urlLink jimmy buffet   Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call, Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall. You've seen it all, you've seen it all.   Watch the men who rode you, Switch from sails to steam. And in your belly you hold the treasure that few have ever seen, most of them dreams, Most of them dreams.   Yes, I am a pirate two hundred years too late. The cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder I'm an over forty victim of fate Arriving too late, arriving too late.   I've done a bit of smugglin' I've run my share of grass. I made enough money to buy Miami, But I pissed it away so fast, Never meant to last, never meant to last.   I have been drunk now for over two weeks, I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks, But I've got to stop wishin', Got to go fishin', I'm down to rock bottom again. Just a few friends, just a few friends.   Instrumental   I go for younger women, lived with several awhile And though I ran away, they'll come back one day. And still could manage a smile It just takes awhile, just takes awhile.   Mother, mother ocean, after all these years I've found My occupational hazard being my occupations just not around. I feel like I've drowned, Gonna head uptown.

      Hey, I'm finally connected to the virtual porch. However, I am wondering if the conversations will be as lively without the assistance of cigarettes and beer. This will probably be better for everyone. Smoking and drinking are bad habits, and I don't mean habits in the Catholic way. I mean consistent behaviors. Goodnight.  Matt

      it works. i'm here.  thoughts on ray?  last album out in august says rolling stone.  duet style ala j. cash.  i'm in. if hawaii was a hot dog would you eat it?  i would.  they're delisous. whittier is hotter than satan's crack right now.  its because the tree is gone.  i told jesse that i'm no longer referring to this dwelling by it's previous name.  to me it is the place-formerly-known-as-the-bayou.  i sat in the hammock (which i have relocated to the only shade spot in the 90601 vicinty) and thought that with this cursed heat the falling of the tree was the christening of a new era (well, that along with many other personal [public and private] struggles that those of our order have dealt with)  any suggestions for a new name.  i thought {@} had a nice ring to it.

      I got an e-mail today about a  urlLink petition  to sign to extend the assault weapons ban after this year. It is being spread by a father of one of the kids killed in the Columbine shootings. The cool thing is that you can track the petition, so I can track who has signed the petition because of me. Make sense? Well, if you agree with me and would like to see the assault weapons ban extended, go here and sign this petition.

      Hello all  It's good to be here.  (Lighting up a Camel and taking a pull of High Life)  I've had a new CD mix on my mind.  It's based on secular artists doing spiritual songs.  This is what I have so far.  1.  I still haven't found what I'm looking for - U2 2.  Given to fly - Pearl Jam 3.  Salvation - the Cranberries 4.  Come on up to the house - Tom Waits 5.  Astral weeks - Van Morrison 6.  Jesus, I/Mary star of the sea - Zwan 7.  Personal Jesus - Depeche Mode 8.  Airline to Heaven - Wilco;Billy Bragg 9.  Turn turn turn - the Byrds 10.  Forever Young - Dylan 11.  Spirit in the Sky - Norman Greenbaum  I know there has to be more songs out there.  Let's hear some suggestions.

      so i've been unpacking books a lot lately, what with moving and all so i thought i would share a couple of poems with you guys that i really enjoy  The Jewel  There is this cave In the air behind my body That nobody is going to touch: A cloister, a silence Closing around a blossom of fire. When I stand upright in the wind, My bones turn to dark emeralds.  -  urlLink James Wright   and this next poem, by billy collins you can listen to if you want to  urlLink here (if you have Realplayer), or just read it below  The Best Cigarette  There are many that I miss having sent my last one out a car window sparking along the road one night, years ago.  The heralded one, of course: after sex, the two glowing tips now the lights of a single ship; at the end of a long dinner with more wine to come and a smoke ring coasting into the chandelier; or on a white beach, holding one with fingers still wet from a swim.  How bittersweet these punctuations of flame and gesture; but the best were on those mornings when I would have a little something going in the typewriter, the sun bright in the windows, maybe some Berlioz on in the background. I would go into the kitchen for coffee and on the way back to the page, curled in its roller, I would light one up and feel its dry rush mix with the dark taste of coffee.  Then I would be my own locomotive, trailing behind me as I returned to work little puffs of smoke, indicators of progress, signs of industry and thought, the signal that told the nineteenth century it was moving forward. That was the best cigarette, when I would steam into the study full of vaporous hope and stand there, the big headlamp of my face pointed down at all the words in parallel lines.  --  urlLink Billy Collins

           though i am sure gloyd will be the most interested, this whole thing is fairly cool. considered among rock circles the best unreleased album ever created, "smile" has recently been finished nearly 40 years after the original recording session in '66   urlLink this article  that i found on msnbc has a fairly glossed over, sort of awed tone to it. there's a fairly interesting  urlLink press release  on the official  urlLink brian wilson  site as well. but it looks like we'll finally get to hear it by the time i am married, because nonesuch is going to release it at the end of september. who knows, maybe with all the music connections floating around here, we might get to hear it earlier than that. i could drink to that...

      well friends and fellow  urlLink   24    fans, we are now much more akin to the ticking scene changes of our favorite television show than ever before! feast your weary blogging eyes on our very own stat tracking counter!!! (*it's just below the "archives" section on the left*)  you may say to yourself, "So what, a counter, big deal.."  but this counter is pretty sweet, drag your mouse over to it, click it, and you can check out amazing information about who is visiting this site! of course i think you have to have the password, and im the only one who has it.... but i will post some statistics when some people actually start to log in. the coolest part it that it will show a  urlLink map of the world with a dot  of where people are logging in from. so hopefully  urlLink darren  will log on soon and we can see a nice red blip glimmering up at us from way  urlLink south of the border .  anyway enough g33k sp34k, im going to go make sure my cat doesn't get blownup by some errant fireworks.

      I'm at Disneyland with nothing too profound to say.  I feel like I've been on a road trip the last little while, so I feel it's appropriate to blog about my adventures.  I had a deep fried twinkie yesterday at the fair in V-town.  The fair was fun.  I rode on the Chris Faris Wheel.  There was a ride there called Magnum.  It spun in circles and featured Tom Selleck's face- for serious.  I also say my grandma.  She seems sad.  It brings me down.  She's got cancer, for those of you who don't know.  Pray for her.  Robyn is hugging me right now.  It is nice.    The Dodgers are 30-10 in their last 40.  Pretty good.  They've really suffered since the trade.  Bachin' this weekend.  I stand to win lots of dough.  I stand to sweat much.  Then it's off to Seattle... and back... and off to a wedding... then Hawaii again... then Bridge School... then Colorado... then Brazil... then Costa Rica... eat my shorts FOO.

      well, i'm hitting the road on monday.  it'll be a good trip i've decided as the locations grow and so do the miles.  i'm not really finding the direct route from stanwood, wa to philadelphia, but that's ok.  i went shooting today with my brother-in-law up on alger mtn. there's a pair of gravel pits there we always go.  pretty nice to shoot stuff with guns.  we've found that bowling pins are the best targets.  they don't break apart because of the plastic casing and are made of oak so they're strong and heavy and reusable.  i'm not sure how many other good uses there are in the world for bowling pins, but i'm sure there's quite a few.  perhaps i'll name some now.    -you can bowl with them -with enough of them you can use them as weights to drown things in rivers or whatever -they'd break a window -i think they would work as a peg leg if attached just below the knee -modern art -you can make funny looking people if you have a sharpie and a bowling pin -a few bowling pins and you can fashion a makeshift crucifix -try carrying a couple bowling pins when you run, the pounds will melt off like butter -they're good for target shooting -they'll pass for a last minute trophy if necessary (sharpie also needed for this application of the bowling pin) -good for testing gravity  ...and these are just a few things i can figure off the top of my head.  try making your own list of interesting things bowling pins are good for...you'll be surprised!!!!!

      sycz -  I wanted to thank you so so much for monopolizing my entire day (the part not spent drinking coffee, smoking or reading  urlLink fark ) by sharing with me your access to the audio archives of the  urlLink coast to coast  radio program. though i will certainly devote more hours (and by hours i mean entire nights follwed by red-eyed mornings) listening to art bell and george noory and their frequently odd and semi-quixotic guest talk about the fringe of reality, (and by reality i mean the stuff we actually think is true... like giants) i wish that there was a way that i could do the whole thing at once.  unfortunately i have to drive to pasadena now and spend time with real life people eating non-organic and super fatty foods. the redwines have invited me up to see them while they are in town and i must heed the call. but when i get back i am going to listen to the totality of the july 28th 2004 show... you should as well.  wish me luck among the fringe shadow cars lurking on the evil 605 freeway  farewell

      I sat in the middle of hwy 90 and watched blue planes loudly fly over my head.  it sounded like they were ripping the sky in two.  they blew smoke out their butts and twisted around, upside down.  it was neat.  blue angels.  seafair 2004.  it made me confident that with these machines we can kick anybody's ass in the world and make them go deaf at the same time. hung out with b.  he's almost philly-bound.  i will miss him.  it will be cool though, because trev and i will be able to see him a decent amount when we move to nyc. i am going to go play horse.  i am better than you are.  so stick it, foo'!

      I had a dream last night that all of our friends and us were in Montana.  There was partying and dancing.  Poppo was there.  I tried to get everyone to ride horses to Yellowstone, but nobody would have it.  I then went to some western/ Native American art store and they were selling Singapore Men.  Anyone else have any fun dreams?  Jesse

      I started jump roping a few days a go.  I did not realize how much jump roping will hurt one's back.  Gosh dang, my back is really sore this mid-morning.  I don't even really care if I have a sexy looking back or not.  Really, the only thing that is worth working on are the abs.  If you have healthy potent abs, you're good to go.  Pecks are a close second.  Pecks and abs, a cup of coffee and Jeff Buckley covering  Sweet Thing  is all I need.  Two out of four isn't too bad.  Robyn illegally downloaded Audrey Hepburn singing  Moon River .  It is so very good.    I'm going to the Dodger game toninght.  It should be fun.  It always is.   I drove Boyz to Men to the House of Blues last night.  They were all very nice, though they couldn't stop beat boxing and harmonizing.  Honestly- everything from the Motel Six jingly (complete with Tom Bodet impressions) to Everly Brothers' to simple, normal conversations.  They handed out roses during their big hit that sounds like a Seal song.  Diana Ross was there, big hair and all.  It was good.  Pray for my Grandma.  Hugs and Kisses.  Jesse

      I realize I might be late on this. For the first time, perhaps, I realize the genius of Tom Waits.  We share a dinner with Peter and Alison. As the evening winds down, the Itunes brings us to Closing Time. Three tracks in, they leave; Amanda reads in bed; I stay up with a bottle of whiskey and actually listen to the lyrics for the first time.   His musicians run circles around him. It doesn't take a genius to notice the complex patterns the drummer brushes around his clunky chords; the tasteful blues notes of the guitar slinking their way beneath the clinky plinked piano. He is not a vituoso. In fact, he can barely play.  I remember reading somewhere, or perhaps hearing firsthand, I can't remember, that Tom Waits used to know someone in Whittier, an old college buddy. He'd visit late at night, before he'd recorded anything professionally, and he'd tap out tunes on the friend's piano, early into the morning. He was horrible, and he kept the neighbors up. There were complaints, threats to call the police if the behavior conitnued.  I had never really listened to a Tom Waits song before tonight. I had never noticed the hearbreaking sincerity wound between the deceptively simple melodies and themes. Heartbreak can only carry a song so far, and it becomes easy to write a melody off for being recognizable. The lyrics are not groundbreaking. They do not express anything that Cole Porter never thought of. They are absurd, but they carry something more than true in their artifice. Tom Waites has made a career out of creating a character, a disheveled ballader, a ner'do well whiskey hound, a hobo with a penchant for Joyce and Brecht. His songs do not mean anything, and yet, they mean exactly everything.  I don't know how to adequately communicate exaclty what it was that I discovered tonight. Perhaps it's that his songs seem to be lacking something; they seem tired and cliche, but retain something so startling and urgent that they demand your fullest attention and loyalty. You want to believe him, though you know he is chasing something impossible. He represents something lost, a Tin Pan Alley nightmare skating on thin ice. But I am right there, waiting to hear what he will say next. And no matter how inevitable it may seem, the next line always seems perfect, fitting, the only phrase that could have ever worked.   It's strange how small perfections can slip your notice, when you are too busy looking for something profound.

      ...caffeine free diet coke.  I am in renton, washington.  east side.  (what, what).  I am in trevor's big a-word house.  I ate a big bowl of chili about hour ago so i'm excited to see how that mother's gonna work itself out.  i'll give a full report.  it's the 6th today, which means that yesterday at 5:29 p.m. eastern standard time I turned 24 years old.  It's the same as before, just now it's officially another year of slacking my life away.  I bought some gillete razors today.  a 4 pack.  big decision whether or not to purchase the 2-blade or 3-blade model.  i went for the 2er.  i'm frugal you know (at least that's what all the hot ladies say). in case you're wondering, whivh i know you are...yes I am wearing a viking helmet with horns on it.  i rather enjoy wearing it, so back the heck up, holmes.  get off my game. trev and i are to meet up in a joyous reunion with brent tonight.   what do you call those hand-gripper, strengthening metal exercise things?  I'm playing with one now.  it kicks a-word. i rode a stationary bike today.  it was amazing.  it was like a bike, but was in a house and didn't go anywhere!  it just stayed in the same place.  i've never seen anything like it.  and hope to never again.  it frightened me.  someone must have conjure a spirit and cast it into that thing. Question:back alley, bare knuckle brawl.  who wins, Glue Stick or White Out?  My money's on White OUT!  p.s. i know this is dude of me, but i'm mirroring this on my site.  i'm too lazy to thing of other not-quite-witty things to write about. so L and Z word you!

      I'm always not home this time of year.  It feels more at home to be not at home July-mid Sept.  I have been in Ventura painting for money.  I'll be going to Seattle in a couple weeks.  Gone for the b-party weekend.  Hawaii in Sept.    Pray for my Grandma.  It looks like lung cancer.  Not suprised, just sad.    I'm listening to Marty Robbins, about to finish the Great Dictator, and will see Jerry Stahl read some later tonight.  The Dodgers are 4-1 since the trades.    Jesse

      hello, all. i'm writing this from the cloudy stanwood washington. dmh and i drove up here monday, it was a flawless performance, 19 hours of bliss. i dropped dmh off at the mall with trevor and then made it up to stanhood by 130 am. it's strange to be here this time, but i'm excited to be heading east next week. i did some research on something i'd always wondered about and found this very interesting. the land in northern california around redding is considered by some to be the 51st state, jefferson state. it's fascinating really; they have a website. urlLink look!  i don't know if that link worked or not. basically these folks got screwed by salem and sacramento and are pissed. the stanwood camano fair is this weekend and the headlining act is starship, whose hit you might remember is "we built this city". i might be busy, however, and i'm not sure i'll make it. or if i do i'll be preoccupied with the livestock i'm sure. pigs are awesome. so is bisquits and gravy which three gas stations on our road trip were advertising specials on. can't think of anything that goes better with ten gallons of fuel, a pack of cigarettes and a dirty restroom. ciao.

      Preface: So in case I am not doing this correctly, this is andrew, not jesse. andrew hamilton, not jesse gloyd. jesse knows how to set up blogs and give clear directions to his friends so that they may join him on his blog. i, andrew, do not know how to set up a blog or post things in my own name.   In case I am doing this correctly, disregard everything I just said.  I. Moving     A. Moving is a strange experience, as I am sure you all can attest. For those of you who have seen the new house, which I believe is the majority of you, rest assured that the house is well in order. Plants are growing, trash is being emptied, life carries on. I have not written a creative word in nearly two months, a cause of much shame and shit upon my head. I am however counting thevirtualporch as creative writing, which should lift any residual shit or shame from my head.   II. Work       Work was going really well. I felt like I was getting the hang of it. I felt like I was begining to gain the respect of my superiors and coworkers. I felt that perhaps fundraising work wasn't so bad. After all, it is a noble and good thing to do one's task with honor, to not waste time by looking up news events and current politcal debates on the Internet. If the Good Lord has given one a job, the least one can do is learn to ignore the cursory boredom and seek to do it well. And so I did. Until last night.       Amanda and I spent last night with our good friends Peter and Alison, parents of our godson Maclane Finnegan, and all around good people. I like Peter and Alison quite a bit. They are creative, well read, fine cooks, respectable drinkers, commited smoker (peter), and sincere and loyal friends. They also hate to hold steady jobs, and seem to relish just barely making ends meet. which in its own way carries a certin amount of respectability with it. After all, I would love to stay home and play with a kid and make art, or read, or, or, well, whatever it is you do when you don't have a full time job. Anyway, just being around them reminded me how much I have ignored how much I resent wearing a shirt and tie everyday, and getting up at 7 fucking o'clock in the morning, and wallowing in front of crazy people for what seems like a measly paycheck but is actually quite good but it's amazing how fast you can burn money no matter the amount when you don't understand the fundamentals of sound finance. it's a catch-22, in the purest sense. I want to stay home. I need money. I don't mind my job, but I hate my job, but what else am I going to do between 8 and 5, but i have debts to pay, but i need to be doing something that reinforces my romantic notion of myself as a WRITER, i.e. i need to be in college and stay up till 9am drinking wine in cowboy hats.  Now of course I don't want to be drinking wine in cowboy hats.  The evening tipped the scales, that's all. And today at work the slightest little thing, I can't even remember what it was now, sent me on an internal rampage, and a passive campaign of telling all of my co-workers that I was quitting.  The moral: 8-5 jobs suck. They pay the bills. They suck the life out of you. I have no one to blame for my lack of creativity but myself. History is soaked with writers who wrote while they worked day jobs. They had what the French call "dedication" and "tenacity." Two qualities that I am severly lacking.   It's not that I hate my job as much as I resent having to pretend to be interested in something that I could not care less about. But, there is that paycheck...  III. Kentucky       Amanda and I went to visit her grandparents' farm in Kentucky two weeks ago, which has proven to be a formative experience. I gained ten pounds in five days by eating meals comprised primarily opf gravy, fried cornmeal, and assorted boiled vegetables, I learned to shoot a gun. I killed birds with said gun. Said gun was a motherfucking shotgun. I met some of the most solid and remarkable men I have ever had the privilege of coming into contact with.        I won't go into terrible detail, as I am planning to give a painfully detailed account of our trip in my next post. But I will say that Kentucky is not a different state, it is a completely different country; much like England in that they speak an English that has little remeblance to the language you and I speak. Exhibit A: Cousin Mary Lynn, pronounced "Merlin." Also witness turkey fans, throats, and feet nailed to the side of a hunting cabin, and bumper stickers reading "I brake for animals. I eat them and wear their skins," and "I don't brake for liberals, gays, and anti-gunners." Also witness a sense of family and place like you would not believe, along with a profound sense of satisfaction with one's life and vocation. I hope your appetites are sufficiently whetted.  IV. Reccomendations      A. Zadie Smith's forward in The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003     B. Don Delillo's Libra, but only after you watch JFK     C. The Thinking Fellow's Union Local 282 -- think sonic youth meets a travelling yiddish carnival, and you might be close.     D. Not buying Charles Shaw and springing for the extra $1.50 on a nicer bottle of wine.     E.  Not using Wal Mart to develop your film, or as a source for anything in particular.     V. Bed       A. I am going to bed.
