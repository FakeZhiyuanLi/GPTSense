      Well, I've spend the last few days hobbling around my house or lying in bed, bored out of my mind with nothing to do.  The reason?  I've pulled the hamstring in my left leg.  To say it hurts would be an understatement.  To say it caused me to be sent home from my evening work because I was shivvering, drenched in sweat and hardly able to do any work, only to spend the night being violently sick would be a more accurate description of what was happening.  So, I've now been off work since Tuesday, when I was sent home.  For someone who usually works 13 hours a day and enjoys having something to do to pass that much time, being stuck at home is a Very Bad Thing.  Daytime TV is terrible, I've read most of the books in my collection and the other books aren't something that interests me right now (why'd I buy them?  I really don't know.) and there's only so much  urlLink Hungry Space  a person can play in one day (excellent little game by the way - well worth a try).  Still, Paul came 'round on Wednesday and hung around until Thursday afternoon, to keep me company.  That was nice of him.  I'm thinking it was part being nice, part leeching my broadband and part slacking-off from studying for his exams but the thought was there and it was appreciated.  Doesn't stop me wanting to go back to work, though.  I'm going back on Monday, no matter what.

      Over the past few months I've been going over how to tell my workplace that I'm transsexual.  I told my parents in 2001 and they've never liked the idea - to be honest, I think they still don't believe me, which is why I don't see them an awful lot now, although recently I've seen them for a few hours once every one or two weeks.  That's about the longest time I can stand to pretend everything's nice and normal before I have to go home and be myself again.  I'm considering e-mailing my line manager and telling him the situation but I'm unsure about whether this would be the best course of action.  I'm going to have to tell them sooner or later since I'm intending to see a psychiatrist and, hopefully, begin hormone therapy to start putting my body right but that could be a couple of months away, at least.  The question is whether I can wait that long and still act like everything's okay.  I don't think I can.

      Well, today is a day off from the standard 13-hour days of working two jobs and I was adamant that I was going to complete the sections of the new rules I'm working on for  urlLink Treasure Trap  today but I've been up since 8.30 and it's now midday.  Know how much work I've done on them?  If you said 'none' you'd be right.  Damn.  It's just one of those days - I get out of bed, watch the news while eating breakfast and trying not to get overly angry at how pathetic most of the people in the world are, then all thought of actually doing anything useful just disappear and I'm left sitting here, thinking 'I should do something but I just can't be bothered'.  This is annoying.  Well, let's see if having yet another cup of tea and a cool shower make any difference to my work ethic.  It's unlikely but it's worth a try.

      Well, it's been a long time since I've bothered with one of these things but last time I kept an online diary, it seemed to help me sort out the mess of thoughts and ideas that are constantly flashing through my brain, with a non-stop ticket to drive-me-insane-land so maybe just typing things in here will help keep my thoughts on what I'm trying to achieve rather than messing my head up into a void of half-realised dreams.

      I'm now feeling a severe panic attack coming on, thanks to having just sent an e-mail to my line manager at work, telling him I'm transsexual and that I intend to see a psychologist in the near future in order to begin the rocky road to gender reassignment surgery.  I composed what I believe was as brief an e-mail as possible but which covered all the points and then sat for a minute or two with the mouse pointer hovering over the send button, trying to will myself to have the courage to send the message.  And then, when I did, I find BT's e-mail server is down.  Is this an omen?  Possibly.  Anyhow, I was by this point determined to send the damn message, so I used their website e-mail facilities and sent it that way.  But now I'm panicing.  Have I done the right thing, announcing this to my workplace via e-mail?  I hope so.

      There's a promotion opportunity at work right now, which is nice.  I applied for one not long ago but didn't get to the interview stage.  This is doubly annoying (not getting an interview is always annoying, after all) because I was told by my line manager to ask the interview people where I went wrong, so I did and they didn't bother getting back to me.  How am I meant to improve if they won't tell me where I went wrong?  Grrrr!  So I'm now sitting here trying to work out what to write for the last two out of five parts for this application form.  The form is a 'competency-based' form, which means instead of writing down all my qualifications and previous experience, I now have to write examples of how I fulfil four 'competencies' they've decided are relevant to the job but I don't think mean anything.  One of the 'competencies' is 'Building Relationships'.  To quote Buffy, "can you vague that up for me"?  This kind of bland crap annoys me, so as well as trying to work out what they mean so I can write something they're looking for, I also have to try to contain my rage at their incredible stupidity.  We're civil servants, not politicians.  We're supposed to say what we mean, not put a stupid spin on it so people are impressed.  We all know nobody is impressed by this kind of crap.  Anway, I'm slacking off from writing this form now because a) I don't want to have to deal with it any more and b) my head is spinning from trying to make myself sound like I want the job while simultaneously hide the fact that as a particle physicist I'm (apparently) massively overqualified for the position.  Being 'overqualified' has lost me so many jobs in the past I don't care to think about it anymore.  Well, I suppose this has been a long enough waffle so I should get back to filling-in this form...  ... I wonder what's on TV...

      Hey, guess what (Who am I talking to?  It's not as if anyone reads this)!  I've managed to pull the hamstrings in both my legs today, plus my ankle is still messed-up.  Because of this, a trip to the doctors to find out what's wrong with me was in order.  So far, so good...  ... but they're not sure.  "It's most likely a pulled hamstring but since this is the third time in three weeks, we're going to have to do some blood tests to see if there's an underlying problem".  Damn.  So, that's tomorrow morning sorted for me.  I hate giving blood - the needles make my itch.  Dunno why, they just do.  Therefore, I booked as early an appointment as possible, to get it out of the way.  Hopefully I'll be able to go back to work afterwards, as sitting around on my ass at home is dull and at least when I'm sitting on my ass at work I've got something to do.  But today I'm stuck here, trying to 'phone work to explain what's going on this time - I'm unable to go in to work since I can hardly walk, so I'm off sick.  Again.  This is doing nothing for my promotion prospects, that's for sure.  However, everyone was in a meeting all morning, so nobody's picking up the 'phone.  I was sure we'd have 'phone cover but it seems not.  Strike one for customer service!  So I'm whiling away my time trying to draw panels for my latest comic but it's not coming along very well at all.  I think I'm going to have to shelve the whole sci-fi, space opera thing and go for something more down-to-earth until my art style improves a bit and I can actually draw what I've described in the scripts.  Because of this, a new web comic is in the works.  I'm thinking of getting some friends involved in the writing and design, too.  I may work, but it probably won't.

      Gah, I don't believe this - my leg gets better but my ankle gets twisted in the process.  Superb luck I'm having here.  Can't I go a single year without illness or stupid problems like this?  Grrrrrr!  Anyhow, all the rules for my new version of the world's oldest, student-run Live Roleplaying Game are completed and ready for playtesting in a few weeks time.  Got to finish writing the adventure for the test, however.  That shouldn't take more than a few hours, though - it's going to be a basic adventure that's got a lot of combat, a decent amount of roleplaying and just be good, plain fun instead of the intense socio-political style of adventures that people have been running of late.  A chance to get back to what adventure roleplaying is supposed to be should be good for the game.  Socio-political settings don't work when out in the middle of a field, I feel.

      Having gotten out of bed far too late to really justify doing anything else, I decided to finish unpacking all my stuff.  It's been six months since I moved into this house (how the time flies when you're doing 13-hours days and so hardly even see the place you're supposed to be living in) so I thought it about time I actually settled in.  It took two hours to finish emptying all the cardboard boxes that have filled up most of my bedroom for the last half-year and  I'm amazed at how much space there is in there now.  I can actually walk around without stubbing my toe on something or tripping over this, that and the other.  Found a lot of clothes I thought had been left at my parents, too, and a couple of backup CDs dating back to 2000.  So, I decided to take a break from unpacking (it was either that or tackle the mountain of clothes sitting on my bed - that's all that's left to do, now) to have a look at what was on these CDs.  Turns out it's backups of my ancient Linux Mandrake box, complete with a copy of my old website, with my first online diary on it.  Having a read through all that was interesting - I've really changed in terms of world viewpoint since then.  Not always change for the better but that's life, I suppose.  In the interests of internet voyeurism, I decided to re-upload that website to its old home on Tripod, as it got overwritten with a prototype version of  The Nob Mouse Network  a few years back but when the Network jumped to  urlLink www.nobmouse.net  there was no reason to continue it, so it was left derelict.  Now it's back, in its original form.  You can see it  urlLink here , if you're so inclined.

      Well, I finally managed to call the recommended psychologist and after a few tries (first time, after spending hours psyching myself up - no pun intended - to call, I got an answerphone 'cause they were on holiday, second time I got the answerphone again 'cause they weren't opening again until that afternoon) I got through to a woman who was very pleasant, put me right at ease and took the information she required in order to give me an appointment.  So now I've got to get a train ticket to London for a fortnight's time.  Not too bad, I think.  'Course now it brings the inevitable day when I have to 'come out' to the rest of the workplace that much closer, which brings me to why I've spent the rest of the day being all shaken up with panic.  It's not good, I don't know if I can do this.  To come out to people I spend most of the day with, five days a week, is scary, almost as bad as telling my parents, something I have to do again.  They didn't really believe me when I first told them and I honestly believe that after three years of not being able to afford to do anything about my problems, they'll have thought I'd overcome them.  I hate to put them through this anguish again but it's something I know I have to do.

      Well, it's been a couple of days now since I 'came out' at work and tomorrow I have the final guy who wants to talk to me about it.  So far, they've all been nice and supportive, to the point of &quot;we don't have a problem with you and anyone who does will answer to us&quot;, which is more than I could have asked for.  My Office Manager has even talked about arranging time off for surgery, when the time comes.  That's still a fair way off, however.  Currently I'm looking at actually getting to talk to a psychiatrist that will see me, which will be a change.  I had to put all my plans on hold because of crippling bad finances for the last 3 years but that was compounded by the only NHS gender identity 'expert' in the region being a crap psychologist who calls us &quot;mutilated freaks&quot; (I kid you not), so when he refused to see me on the grounds of 'too heavy a workload at the moment', I wasn't entirely disappointed.  Still, I have the number of a private psych that's highly recommended, so I'm going to 'phone him and see what can be arranged.  All in all, a very pleasant surprise about work and for the first time in as long as I can remember, I'm actually feeling a little happy.

      Well, I can't sleep once again.  This is becoming a habit I'm more than happy to give up.  If it's not pain in my ankle (it's still not healed up and the doctor says there's nothing he can do about it) it's worry about work tomorrow.  Such is life.  Tomorrow (well, today now - I just noticed it's 3am) I have to talk to my Line Manager (my immediate boss at work and the guy I e-mailed about being TS) and my Office Manager (the guy  he  e-mailed about me being TS, apparently along with the Group Manager and Central Office, so now the whole government probably knows.  Grrr).  I'm not looking forward to this at all, which probably explains why I can't sleep.  No, actually there's no 'probably' about it - it's  definitely  the reason I can't sleep.  I'm worried sick 'cause I can't work this guy out.  He's nice, he's professional but he and a few others in the office have made one or two jokes before, thanks to  urlLink There's Something About Miriam , which broadcast on Sky earlier in the year.  I don't know whether he's going to be okay to be around after this, but I suppose there's no going back now.
