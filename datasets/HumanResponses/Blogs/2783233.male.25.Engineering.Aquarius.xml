      Well, that was pretty painless. Welcome to my blog, although I'm probably only talking to myself. Which is fine, as this blog is intended to serve as a memory, a history of thoughts to clue me in to the subtleties and nuances of the past that my brain tends to forget.

I guess the majority of us Americans like things really big and gaudy with little or no thought to design. Hence, the Hummer H2 and Xbox. :)

      Todays the superbowl. We're having everyone over to our apartment to watch it on the new TV. Its sad, but I'm more excited about watching it in full 1080i HDTV than I am about actually watching the game. Oh and the commercials... those are always good.

      This LCD monitor seems to be as perfect as you can get nowadays. 12ms response time, huge viewing angle, 3 year warranty. It even includes extra brackets for mounting right on the wall.

      I've been seriously considering making my next desktop a Mac (horror of horrors!). The jury is still out on that one, but this bit of news may just lean me closer to the Apple side of the court.   "you want to use iMovie with your Sony DCR-DVD300, right? I hear (have not done this myself) that this is easily done by using Quicktime Pro to convert the .vob files from the DVD into .dv files, which can then be used in iMovie. Secondly, I will bet iMovie will soon support these camcorders."  Story developing.....   Here a thread regarding this issue. Doesn't look promising:   urlLink MPEG-2 in iMovie

Its 14.95 for the full version. But from what I see, it seems worth it. Especially when T-Mobile is selling MP3 ringtones for $1.99 each.

It also has a color screen on which you can view stored photos... another feature that won't sell any extra units. Its only available in Japan in the near future. &nbsp; urlLink

      The horror! After hours of debates and police disputed arguments between environmentalists and US Open officials, the endangered piping plover nest in the 3rd hole sandtrap suddenly "disappeared". I'm not sure who's more pathetic, the environmentalists who cordoned off the area with police tape, the police who drove out on the fairway with their red lights flashing, or the US Open officials who deliberated for hours over whether a ball in the Plover sandtrap would incite a one stoke penalty or a free ball drop. The US Open has put up $500,000 reward for the arrest of the "perpetrator". As the police chief said, "Damned strange if you ask me".    This stories worth a read.

      Brandtsons new CD Send Us A Signal is set for a June 15th release. From what I've heard of it, its somewhat of a departure from thier previous releases... in a good way. Brandtsons last few releases were good, but stagnant. The last 3 releases could have all fit together into one big album. Send Us A Signal seems to be a breadth of fresh air to what was becoming a formulaic pattern of releases.   Thier new home at The Militia Group is serving them well. Send Us A Signal will be available on iTunes. Something Deep Elm never came close to achieving with thier weak distribution.    urlLink Brandtson.com

      Heres some juicy info on Apples next iPod via AppleInsider.com. Seems the device will contain the to-be released Toshiba 60GB drive in time for September. Its rumored to have a 2 inch color screen and a previously rumored "enhanced" dock with video outs. Its also rumored to be using some sort of mini-OS to run everything.  This could be very interesting. Theres a whole lot of hurdles Apple will have to get over to make this one work. I'm not so much excited about watching movies on a 2-inch screen, which seems a bit of a novelty to me. What I'm excited about is the ability to use this as some sort of portable Tivo... and the possiblity of combining PDA type functionality into the OS (something a bit more robust than the Notes feature of the current iPods). Theres also the "Home on the go" concept that Apples been tpying around with, but if that ever happens it will be a Mac OS thing only I'm sure. I wonder if they will reveal any of this at WWDC in June.   urlLink AppleInsider | Sources: 4th generation iPod due this Fall

         About a month ago I was driving on the LIE on a Sunday and a real exotic looking car flew by at around 80 MPH in the HOV lane. I've seen plenty of nice cars in the Hamptons (Bentleys, Rolls Royce, Ferraris, etc), but this was something I'd never seen before. I couldnt make out the emblem as it was going by, but I did notice the rear window curtains! Well I finally found out what it was.. a Maybach. HowStuffWorks.com has a great overview of some of it features, which include a refrigerator, reclining rear seats, a glass sunroof controlled by liquid crystal, V-12 540+ HP, and the list goes on. They go for $300,000 to $400,000 and only 1,000 are made a year. Now I just wonder who was in it....    urlLink How Maybachs Work     urlLink Maybach USA

      Gather round Republican and Democrat boys and girls. Its story time.   I came across this parable in the comments of the seanbonner.com post below. I'd give credit, but last time I checked i knew youknowthisemailisfake@yahoo.com is fake.    A woman in a hot air balloon realized she was lost. She lowered altitude and spotted a man in a boat below. She shouted to him, "Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't know where I am."   The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, "You're in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level. You are 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude."   She rolled her eyes and said, "You must be a Republican."   "I am," replied the man. "How did you know?"   "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and I'm still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help to me."   The man smiled and responded, "You must be a Democrat."   "I am," replied the balloonist. "How did you know?"   "Well," said the man, "You don't know where you are or where you're going. You've risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect ME to solve your problem. You're in EXACTLY the same position you were in before we met, but, somehow now, it's MY fault..."!

       Rich Lowry is my new hero. I heard Rush Limbaugh quote this article in the National Review Online on his show yesterday. I havn't heard the blind hatred of Bush explained in such consise, factual terms any better than Rich Lowry does in this article. I dare a libral to explain this away.     I have reprinted it below:     W.’s Double Binds  Sometimes a political figure becomes so hated that he can't do anything right in the eyes of his enemies. President Bush has achieved this rare and exalted status. His critics are so blinded by animus that the internal consistency of their attacks on him no longer matters. For them, Bush is the double-bind president.   If he stumbles over his words, he is an embarrassing idiot. If he manages to cut taxes or wage a war against Saddam Hussein with bipartisan support, he is a manipulative genius.   If he hasn't been able to capture Osama bin Laden, he is endangering U.S. security. If he catches bin Laden, it is only a ploy to influence the elections.   If he ignores U.N. resolutions, he is a dangerous unilateralist. If he takes U.N. resolutions on Iraq seriously, he is a dangerous unilateralist. If he doesn't get France to agree to his Iraq policy, he is ignoring important international actors. If he supports multiparty talks on North Korea, he is not doing enough to ignore important international actors.   If he bombed Iraq, he should have bombed Saudi Arabia instead, and if he had bombed Saudi Arabia, he should have bombed Iran, and if he had bombed all three, he shouldn't have bombed anyone at all. If he imposes a U.S. occupation on Iraq, he is fomenting Iraqi resistance by making the United States seem an imperial power. If he ends the U.S. occupation, he is cutting and running.   If he warns of a terror attack, he is playing alarmist politics. If he doesn't warn of a terror attack, he is dangerously asleep at the switch. If he says we're safer, he's lying, and if he doesn't say we're safer, he's implicitly admitting that he has failed in his core duty as commander in chief.   If he adopts a doctrine of preemption, he is unacceptably remaking American national-security policy. If the United States suffers a terror attack on his watch, he should have preempted it. If he signs a far-reaching antiterror law, he is abridging civil liberties. If the United States suffers another terror attack on his watch, he should have had a more vigorous anti-terror law.   Bush's economy hasn't created new jobs. If it has created new jobs, they aren't well-paying jobs. If they are well-paying jobs, there is still income inequality in America.   If Bush opposes a prescription-drug benefit for the elderly, he's miserly. If he supports a prescription-drug benefit for the elderly, he's lining the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies. If he restrains government spending, he's heartless. If he supports government spending, he's bankrupting the nation and robbing from future generations.   If he opposes campaign-finance reform, he's a tool of corporate interests. If he signs campaign-finance reform, he's abridging the First Amendment rights of Michael Moore (whose ads for Fahrenheit 9/11 might run afoul of the law).   If he accuses John Kerry of flip-flopping, he is merely highlighting one of the Massachusetts senator's strengths — his nuance and thoughtfulness. If he flip-flops on nation-building or testifying before the 9/11 commission, he proves his own ill-intentions, cluelessness, or both.   If he doesn't admit a mistake, he is bullheaded and detached from reality. If he admits a mistake, he is damning his own governance in shocking fashion.   If he sticks with Dick Cheney, he is saddling himself with an unpopular vice president, giving Democrats who can't wait to run against Cheney a political advantage. If he drops Cheney, he is admitting that the Democratic attacks against his vice president have hit home, thus giving Democrats who have made those charges a political advantage.   If he loses in November, the voice of the American people has spoken a devastating verdict on his presidency. If he wins, he stole the election.   — Rich Lowry is author of Legacy: Paying the Price for the Clinton Years.    urlLink Rich Lowry on George W.

       urlLink     Today Apple released the new iPod. Its 1mm, yes MILLImeter (woopdee doo), thinner than the previous generation and features a clickable scroll wheel very similar to the iPod mini. However, probably the most trumpeted feature by current iPod users will be the 12 hour battery life, up from 8. Other than that, theres a few tweaks to the user interface, such as the "Shuffle Songs" button on the main menu. This was sorely needed, as previously you had to go through multiple tiers of menus to get to it. I hope they release a firmware update for us older iPod users.  &nbsp;  Pricing has been "reduced" by 100 bucks for both the 20 and 40 GB models. I&nbsp;use quotes because they removed a bunch of accessories from the&nbsp;box.

      For those of us who have yet to get a DVD Recorder, hold out  just  a bit longer. Analysts say the prices of DVD Recorder will fall 50% in the 2nd half of this year thanks to cheaper ASIC's and those good ole Taiwanese. First dual-layer burners, now this! This Christmas may just be the year of the DVD burner.   urlLink PCWorld.com - DVD Recorder Prices Expected to Plunge

      Well, I've been toying with the idea of transfering my home phone over to Vonage. I'm still a bit hesitant, but voice over IP has come a long way, so I hear. Heres some good sources of information for those who are in the same boat.   urlLink Vonage.com   urlLink The Official Vonage Forum   urlLink The Official Unofficial Vonage Forum

      I would consider this a moveon.org for the right. Redstate.org is a collection of blogs and discussion from republican bloggers. A great way to catch up on the side of the news you don't get from the mainstream media.   urlLink Redstate.org

      Metacritic is a cool website I stumbled upon that has reviews of films, games, music and DVD's. You may be saying "So what?..". What makes Metacrtic different, is that it compiles a list of reviews from professional reviewers around the internet and creates an average rating based upon these outside reviews. Think of it as a one stop shop of reviews.   urlLink metacritic: Film Reviews, Game Reviews, Music Reviews, DVD Reviews
