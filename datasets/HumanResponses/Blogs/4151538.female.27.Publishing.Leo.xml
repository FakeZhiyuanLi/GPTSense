      Today there were 47 pieces of SPAM in my email account. Forty-friggin-seven! So I did my usual: “remove me” request, delete and grab the next. This time there were 7 emails that would not allow me to unsubscribe at all, 3 dead unsubscribe links, and 3 that sent me into the middle of the pop-up window battlefield.L  It’s official: SPAM sucks. (That goes for the meat too.)

      So poetry.com sends me this notification of the awards I’ve won. Here’s the funny part…in order to receive them, all I have to due is pay a nominal fee ($160) and submit a poem. I’m tempted to write an ode to poo. Hehehe.  Dung, terd, poo Oh how I think of you as I sit on my throne of porcelain and think of what might have been your scent graciously wafts through the room Passersby ask: “Ooh…Is that your perfume?” Then with a plop you descend Destined to meet your watery end I flush—it’s a relief, I must admit The toilet’s clogged…oh Shit!   Let’s see what kind of award I get for this wonderfully artisitic piece o' *&amp;%^!!!!

      J’ai trente semaine. D’ici la, il ya un enfant dans les bras de Martin et il est tres heureux. Maintenant, il n’y a pas une probleme. J’en bonne santé. Aussi, mon enfant en bonne santé. Elle/Il a battement de cœur tres vigoureux. :)  S'excusez moi, s'il vous plait. La française de moi est tres rouillé.  Je parle a mon enfant dans la francaise, parce que Scott ne voudrais pas savoir.

      So Martin calls me today… (The fifth concerned college friend to call in 3 hours) “How’re ya doin?” “Fine…” “That’s not what I heard.” Goddamn rumor mill. “Heard your heart’s been actin’ up. You ok?” What I want to say: I’m F’ing Fine. Why the Hell do you need to know anyway? “I’m fine. Nothing to worry about.” “Well your heart’s nothing to mess with. Did you go see a DR. yet?” What I want to say: Bite me. Since when are you my f’ing health advisor? “I’ll get there when I get time.” “When you get time? (he laughs) What if you’re short on time and it all ends cuz you were too busy to go to the DR’s?” “Then the Big Guy better make room for me. Could ya let him know I prefer to sleep in on Sundays? I’ll sing, but I ain’t singing no hymns. I’d also like a room with a view.And the whole milk and honey thing…let’s go with chocolate milk and strawberries instead.” … Of course that changes the subject right there. Atheists hate it when you tell them that you would like them to give a message to God…even when you call him the “Big Guy.” Yep, it was rude, but Martin knows better. Don’t you Marty? HEHEHE

      Here I am a writer...who can't write...at least not today. I picked an impossible topic for a research paper and am now paying the price. It sucks to be me.  I can't wait until this essay is done!

      There are 71 new SPAM messages today...they are from yesterday and today only.  I could "earn" $400-$600, lose 50 pounds, meet my perfect mate or learn a new language all in a week! I can now purchase Viagra, Oxycotin, cigars, ink cartridges, and business cards at incredible discounted prices! You wouldn't believe the freebies: "B-B-Q grille" [sic], an amethyst ring, 2 DVDs of my choice, five free receivers from DirecTV!  I am so friggin lucky! Now to unsubscribe and delete them all. What a chore! If only I got paid to do that!  More to come...I'm sure!

      I have this friend who is adopting another friend's baby. It's a pretty cool deal...this baby was an accident and its father wants nothing to do with it. Then my nearly best friend steps in and says that he'd love to adopt, if she's okay with it. It took her a while to decide, but she finally agreed that he would have an ideal home for the baby. He's now hanging out and waiting for March when he gets to take his baby home.  The whole thing is odd...one man says he'd rather not have this baby...the other says he'd do anything for it. And, honestly, the mother just wants the best for her baby.  I just hope it all works out well for every one of them...well most of them. I'm still a cynic.

      Honestly, I wonder how people can deal with not knowing. If I know part of something, I want to know the rest...and I want to know it now. (I'm not patient.) In fact, wondering about something can make me overly anxious (thanks to the cess pool...I mean gene pool).  Here's a fun worry:  the last essay I wrote. I wonder did I completely bomb it? Does the prof think I'm an idiot? I haven't seen the grade yet and it's been a full week. It's completely eating me up. (Go ahead and laugh at me...I do it all the time.) I think about what could happen...he'll read aloud in class for shits and giggles, he'll pull me aside after class and ask me "What the Hell were you thinking?" or I'll get another "B." But then I know that won't happen, cuz that's too easy. (Nothing in my life has come easy.)  Then I wonder is it normal to obsess so much about little things...then I'll run and it'll all be better.

      I do not want free condoms Latex allergy I do not want to know how to attract women Hetero here I do not want to join your pyramid scheme Honest day's work, honest day's pay I do not need Viagra Young Female  All this is obvious to me, but the spammers don't get it. After neglecting my bulk mail box for 5 days, there were no less than 307 irrelevant emails. I'm not sure how they got my name, and I set out to remove it from every detestable list. I started with the first email...clicked on the unsubscribe button (when available), pasted in my email address (when necessary), then deleted the foul message. I continued through the ENTIRE FRIGGEN LIST. By the time I reached the end...an hour later...there were 6 more...which I also unsubscribed from. Funny thing is most of these emails came from the same list company...but I unsubscribed from each message. I wonder if the spammers will get the picture. I doubt it. But, I wanted to even the score...15 for me, 15 for them.    Now let's see what happens tomorrow.
