      I did great yesterday during the day at work, then when I got home, my husband wanted to go on a date.....to the STEAK HOUSE!!! It was great to have time to ourselves, since Gabby was with her grandparents. I ordered what I wanted but didn't even eat half of it. :)&nbsp; And I passed up the popcorn and coke at the movie. Oh, White Chics is a FUNNY, FUNNY movie!!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Today I am cleaning house, working on work stuff and some of our friends that were in the Marine Corps with us will be coming up from Augusta tonight.

      Current Weight: 179  Goal Weight: 130  Total Lost: a whole lotta nada!  &nbsp;  Well the journey has begun again. The last time I went on a hard core diet, my husband was on a ship for 6 months. It was a lot easier when all I had to cook for was myself. I felt so much better and looked so great, he almost passed me up on the flight line when they returned. Now 2 years later, I have been on some medications and made my weight jump. I have a family history of obesity. I REFUSE to let that history become my future!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am a member of Women's Fitness Works. It has kinda the setup of Curves, but better!&nbsp; My boss/fearless leader, gave me a membership to Weight Watchers for Valentines Day. This was during the time of medication and it really wasn't motivational going to meeting to see that you had gained 10 lbs in 2 weeks.&nbsp; Although I let her down, I stopped going. I do still have my information so I will be using that as my guide.  &nbsp;    Excercise    30 Minutes Cardio/Weights  &nbsp;    Points Counter  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24  Starting Points&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -04 Coke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -11 Crawfish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +04 Exerc Points&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -01 Apple Dippers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -04 Coke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -07 Turkey Sand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  1 point left  And with the success of 1 point&nbsp;to end the day, Gabby had some extra Oreo cookies........So now I am at -2!!!&nbsp; I will get better at this!  &nbsp;  *Thank you Michelle for the idea! :)  &nbsp;
