      This weekend went by fast, even though it was lacking in things to do. Despite the budsmoke it was a kinda sucky weekend. I dunno...I haven't been going out with Sarah long and I don't know her very well, but I feel like its always gonna stay that way. We never seem to spend more than a half an hour--tops together and theres never any conversation. I wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy...Guess I'll just have to wait for that one day when I call shes home or she calls me to see her...that one day...somewhere down the road. I came home early tonight to do some make-up work and Im glad to say I at least got some done so hopefully I can pass grammer, I don't know about ICA though those essays seem to be amongst the missing. Well going back to my bed and the one thing I can always count on to be comforting...sleep.

      School sux, I saw Dennis today and he somehow had the nerve to tell me I still owe him money. Now what the fuck kind of shit is that?! I dunno that jes pisses me off he has no right to ask for any kind of compensation after that. He took the money out of me in physical pain as well as hospital bills and the pure fact that he could be owing me money a whole lot quicker with one call to the cops. Dennis sit back, realize how cool about this I've been and give me a motherfucking break. Im still paying goddamn court fees from before and I dont have a fucking job so just accept me being cool and what you did payment enough. Whatever s'bullshit. So neways on a different note...I was glad I got to talk to Sarah last night, I feel bad tho because I can't help but feel bad for being the person who came between her and Tina. Todays just a generally bad day and all I can hope for is for it to start going better....sometime....
