      I don't usually watch movies without my hubby.  It has become a ritual for us to watch movies together at home.  While we eat dinner or eat we have the TV on, and since there is nothing usually on TV, we end up watching a movie.  Today I watched a movie all on my lonesome because it was a girlie flick and he just didn't want to see it because our friend's comment about it was, "It's a good movie, but a depressing chick flick."  So, I told hubby I would watch the movie while he was at work, which is what I did today.  The movie in question is  THE HOURS .  For some reason I didn't watch it on the TV in the living room but here at the computer.  Probably because during the day this is where I spend most of my day doing my writing goodness and dreaming my dreams, and hoping something will come of them one day to the rest of the world.  Even if the rest of the world doesn't like what I write, I get an absolute blast out of what I do.  It entertains me, and the computer is a central place for me.  So, I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that the one time I watch a movie solo in months I should do it on the computer screen (17" at that), with the dogs at my feet, a nice glass of soda at my side, and a cheese sandwich to fill my belly.  The movie was excellent.  It made me cry and think.  It made me want to write  better  than Virginia Woolf (impossible but hey) and to write something of lasting value where people twenty years down the road will be making movies about (hopefully good movies).    For 114 minutes I was lost in a world of just myself and actors on a screen and enjoyed every single second of it.  I participated with the screen in a way I haven't done in ages.  It was a guilty pleasure.   And I want to do it again.     I don't want to watch every single movie alone, but some movies I do want to watch all by my lonesome just to see if there is something different I gain from them.  What will I get from watching  Big Fish  on my own?  No, not going to watch that one just yet, the loss of my own Dad is just a little bit too recent, but yes, I do want to watch that one on my own.  I may even go to the video store and go down the isles and pick out some movies I want to watch just on my own.    This has been something I have actually threatened in the past but never done.  It seemed so unfair.  Now...now I'm going to do it.  I'm going to revel in a once-a-week movie just for myself here at the computer and let my mind wander into whatever realm it chooses without regret, into its own guilty pleasure and see what comes of the choices.  Watching movies with my hubby is something I dearly love to do, but this is something I also enjoy doing, now I've done it.  It is sort of a "girl's day in" sort of thing.  Yes, a girl's day in.  What will be my next choice for my "girl's day in"?  An Elvis movie?   Titanic ?  No, I have not seen that one.  There are actually a lot of movies I haven't seen because I didn't want to force "girlie movies" onto my hubby.  So, why not see some of them on my own?  Yes, it sounds like a plan to me.

      Do you remember those times when you sat down in front of the television set and actually had something to watch?  Certain days were for certain television shows.  Now, if you don't have cable, like me, you BEG for something good to be on TV before you start rummaging through your video and DVD collection for something decent to watch.    I don't know about you, but for me, I am tired as hell of the real-life TV crap the networks are trying to cram down my throat.  Let's face it:  We have enough "real life" happening and when I sit down in front of my TV, I don't want real life anything, except perhaps  Celebrity Mole , and watch something made up, something someone used their imagination to create and entertain me with dang it!  Where are the  Knot's Landing-Dallas-Dynasty  shows I used to love to watch?   Sex In The City  was ok, but it just didn't grab my attention like Alexis did when she was fighting with Blake Carrington.  Now there were some shows!  And what about those wonderful action flicks you just couldn't get enough of like  The A Team , and  V ?  Does anyone remember Ron Perlman's Vincent from  Beauty and the Beast ?  Most recently we had  Xena  and  Hercules .  What do we have now?  Let's see ...  Andromeda  which will be picked up by the Sci Fi Channel and no longer on network TV.  We have  Enterprise  which took me a while to win me over, but is good.  It isn't  Star Trek: Next Generation  or  Star Trek: Voyager , but it smacks of adventure.  It is nice to see how everything may or may not have begun with The Federation.  We also have the  CSI  group of shows which aren't bad - I DO watch those now when I get a chance.  One show I found extremely enjoyable was  Jake 2.0  and it bit the dust.  Now, what is left?  Bachelor, Bachelorette, For Love or Money, Survivor?  Please, haven't we had enough of this.  The fad is over.  We've seen all the mistakes made (and repeated several times) and now it is time for something creative and imaginative out there to be put on TV.  Something that requires acting and film-making.  Yes, acting and real film-making would be really nice to see Network Execs.  Or are you so bloated from feeding off of the life-blood of what-came-before you don't give a damn about what we have now?

      Sitting here in my little house, writing my little stories, dreaming my little dreams (ok, maybe they aren't so  little ) I had no idea something spectacular happened in the world until my husband came in one day this week and told me a private citizen had flown into space.  Where was I when this happened?  I mean, sure, the Internet is my friend and I am constantly surfing it, so why didn't I see anything pertinent about this event?  The sad part is, when grandchildren and youngsters say, "Where were you the day SpaceShip1 took flight?" I am not going to have an answer.  Sadly, my husband found only a small blurb really in our local newspaper and nothing was on the news.  The pilot and backer were going to be on Jay Leno but my dear hubby must get up at 5:30 in the morning in order to get to work, so no late-night TV for him.    Today I decided I would look and see what I could find, and found it at www.scaled.com!  We have probably stepped into a new age.  Here there is an article, including a video clip of the flight, at least the burst and landing of the craft.  On June 21, 2004 ... Under the command of test pilot Mike Melvill, SpaceShipOne reached a record breaking altitude of 328,491 feet (approximately 62 miles or 100 km), making Melvill the first civilian to fly a spaceship out of the atmosphere and the first private pilot to earn astronaut wings.   (www.scaled.com press release, my italics)  This man should receive a ticker-tape parade, like the first astronauts!  I'm telling you, this is simply an awesome happening!  What does this mean for NASA?  Does it mean NASA is finally going to have to get off it's butt and get to doing some important again?  Yes.  Does it mean people are really going to have to take care of what we have so we don't destroy what else is out there in the Universe?  Yes.  Let's face it, we as a race, as a species, do no have a wonderful track record.  We have nearly destroyed this planet by greed and belief something will never disappear.  All of those now extinct animals would argue a different point...against us.  Even today there are animals on the endangered list fighting for survival before they disappear totally from our world.    Now, in essence, the private company has been unleashed on the Universe.  It was, of course, inevitable.  Still, part of me cringes.  Have we learned anything in all these years of living on this world?  Can we make it to another planet  without  destroying it once we get there or having to say "Oops, sorry, my bad" when an animal goes extinct.  And just what if that animal is as sentient as a human being?  Dolphins are supposed to be as sentient as human beings, yet look at how they are treated.  Only when we see other humanoid creatures like ourselves will our prejudice for a "populated" Universe be satisfied I'm afraid.  I applaud this great and wonderful day of SpaceShip1 - and I am also frightened by it.   Here are some links for you to follow:    urlLink Scale Composites web site   urlLink SpaceShipOne's Press Release   urlLink http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/success_spaceshipone.html?2162004'>Universe Today  You can also find video footage at MSNBC, which was too cool to watch really!

      I do not usually fall into the   book craze  and purchase books merely because they are  supposed  to be good; however, I am going to purchase Bill Clinton's autobiography.  I'm just trying to really figure out WHY I want to read it so very much.  Let's face it, when it comes to politics I am apathetic  at best  in activity, but I do care about what is happening with my country.  Unfortunately, I have come to a sad conclusion that nothing I do, even voting, is going to matter or make a bit of difference because the "popular vote" versus the "electoral college" is going to fail every damn time.  As a nation, the electoral college was outgrown somewhere back in the 1950s.  Wow, that makes it last century.  Still, it remains because the people in power want to remain in power and frankly,  They  are afraid we will make the wrong choice (i.e. not their choice) for President of the United States.    When Bill Clinton was elected, the Big Wigs thought he was going to be easily controlled.  Boy, were they wrong.  Why else would they expend so many millions of dollars trying to prove his infidelity?  Yet, despite all of this, he managed to BALANCE THE BUDGET!   Don't get me wrong  - I am not a Bill Clinton supporter.  I have never supported him, but if you really look at what he accomplished, well, it's impressive, and I'm interested in hearing what he has to say.  Not about his affair.  (I was so tired of that when it was running on TV and am tired of it now.)    Despite my opposition to him, the man has won my respect and I  want  to read his book.    You want to know the really, really cool part?  Because of my friend Cheyenne (guy not girl) and his wonderful anniversary present, I now have a Barnes & Noble card.  I think my first purchase with it will be this book, and then a cafe' mocha.    NOTE:   There will be another day for exhorting the wonders and deliciousness of a cafe' mocha while sitting in Starbucks in the Barnes & Noble store and writing, or reading as the case may be.

      There are times, like today, when all I would really love to do would be to get on a four-wheeler or ATV and head out onto the road and down the river with my fishing pole and tackle box on the back (or the front) and just sit on the side of the river bank and do some fishing.  Just throw the line into the river and sort of watch the bobber bob and just sit in the quiet of the day while the river sang its song and the birds backed up the melody.  Then I would pull out my moleskin journal, inevitably, and begin writing.  There is something about sitting on the side of the river bank and writing.  I never know exactly where I'm going to end up in my imagination.  Sometimes it's an entirely different planet, sometimes it's a fantasy realm.  Sometimes I just pull out my own journal and write down my own thoughts and worries, and they seem to lighten.  No river bank here in Lexington.  No place for me to run away to and just be by myself, at least not like there on the river bank where it's easy to collect your thoughts and ease your breath.  Of course, not everything is easy there, or good.    I sure do miss it.

        Dear Senator Kerry,  My name is ._________.  I am a __ year old woman who lives in Lexington, Kentucky. I am physically handicapped, and, up until this electoral year I had a firm belief nothing I truly did, even in voting, would make any difference in the outcome of the election or in the nation. Many years ago I lost the faith in due process and am only now beginning to think, just maybe, things could be different in this nation.  Although I am a registered Republican, in the main election you will have my vote. You will also have the vote of my husband.  Senator Kerry, whether or not you personally receive this letter is a moot point: I understand someone will read this letter, and perhaps, pass its contents along to you. In so saying this I would like to point out a few items I am deeply concerned about and would like to voice them to you at this time.  I am a physically handicapped individual. I have been physically handicapped my entire life. Despite my handicap I worked and then had to take disability because of even further decreased health. Because of this I am on Social Security Disability and therefore on Medicare.  Because of this I cannot work, even though there are times during the warm months of the summer there is a possibility of a short span of work opportunity for any extra income, because I need my benefits and my husband and I cannot afford my medical expenses without Medicare and the disability income. Even if I am unable to work, the Medicare system is so shot at this time it does not assist in paying much of my medical bills.  My husband,  is working as a custodian at a local university even though he has a degree in Applied Mechanical Science in Computer Animated Design Drafter because this was the only place he was able to secure work and provide me with medical insurance, as well as himself. He sent out his resumes for over a year, so secured this position to keep our household fed and our bills paid. We are members of the working poor. We are not even in the Middle Class income bracket.  Whether or not we are members of the Middle Class, I believe everyone’s voice could be heard, so am lifting mine.  1) We need a system overhaul of Medicare to help each and every individual, not just the elderly.  2) We need an employment opportunity in order to further the security of our household and reach toward the American Dream which has been illusive despite how hard we work.   3) The minimum wage needs to be increased in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, as well as the nation.  Some examples of how this could be done is with alternative energy sources such as thermal, hydro-electric, solar, wind turbines, and the legalization of hemp as a potential alternative to our fossil fuels. This would also help our environment tremendously as there is over 5000 different uses, currently known. Everything that is made by petroleum can be made by hemp, including concrete, clothing, plastic, and paper.  The use of hemp would help save our trees as you yourself said “trees are the cathedrals of nature.” We should indeed try to save them and thus ourselves.  There are other plants than hemp that grow faster than trees and could be used more readily.  And yes, my husband and I both know hemp is different from marijuana.  4) Public transportation and tourist trains would also help the economy. Better bike trails and transportation for handicapped individuals would also help the economy of Kentucky as well as the nation itself.  5) Better pay for our firefighters and policemen and women should also be more formalized. In Lexington, Kentucky the policemen and women are still working even though their pay is far below the national limit. Because of their selflessness, my husband and I have even more respect and admiration for them.  6) Both my husband and I believe natural medicines and herbal supplements should have a better standard upon them.  My husband and I have had to look to natural medicines because of the high cost of medicines. Many doctors I have had to see have discounted the natural medicines and herbal supplements, even though they help and have been used for thousands of years. In this nation natural medicines have been scoffed at as a New Age fad or health nuts, when in reality all medicine are based on these plants.  It is a shame many children are prescribed Prozac® when perhaps St. John’s Wort would be just as effective, or just talking to the child and having parental guidance and love.  Another example is my mother, whom I recently lost due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Congestive Heart Failure and kidney failure. During her long struggle with these horrible diseases and having to watch her slowly wither and die before me, there were many drugs she could have used to help extend her life and make the quality of her life better, but they were unavailable due to cost.      She had to take special shots called Procrit® to help her gain strength and morphine for pain, but it took away her appetite and sometimes made her very sick to her stomach, so therefore she had to have another medicine to settle her stomach, which took away her appetite; we then had to give her another medicine to help her get her stomach.  The medicine to help her regain her appetite grew too expensive so we discovered Elder Tonic which would help her get her appetite back. Still, sometimes when she ate she was still very sick to her stomach.  A nurse said there was a medicine that could help with her appetite called Merinol® that would help increase her appetite, settle her stomach, and perhaps help with pain. This drug was approximately $900 for one month’s supply which neither she, nor anyone in the family could afford. Her insurance company would not cover this medicine either, and the doctors were afraid to prescribe it to her.  Their reluctance led me and my husband to research Merinol® and discovered it was THC, the active ingredient in marijuana and in your own brain naturally for pain.  By the time of my research, I discovered the pain relieving aspect of the drug had been removed or reduced drastically so that it was only for appetite. It was this particular form of the drug that was over $900 for a monthly supply.  This led me to question why marijuana was illegal when cigarettes, the cause of my mother’s pain and eventual death, were not. It also led me to wonder why, in a state marijuana is legal under a doctor’s prescription, such as California, the DEA is arresting the doctors and places that prescribe it.  I worked for the Social Security Administration and had to listen to alcoholics explain their disease to me, and yet alcohol is legal. This does not make common sense.  I do not propose alcohol be banned, we are far from the 1920s, but, possibly, the legalization of marijuana. Marijuana should not be legalized to the point where sixteen year old children could get it from a store (but they could get it as it is now), but as with alcohol and cigarettes there should be an age-limit as to its purchase. Cigarettes are simply bad for you, whereas tobacco is not in itself. Alcohol is not bad for you, but you should use it in reason. If anything should be banned it is cigarettes. They kill.  It is time our nation became progressive in the view of health and preventative health care (such as exercise in elementary schools and up; exercise that is interesting to kids such as martial arts, archery, dance, etc.) and its medicines.  7) Stem cell research and partial birth abortion is one subject I am hesitant to list. I am not in favor of partial birth abortion for the harvesting of stem cells for research. A life is a life. The placenta and the afterbirth can easily be used for the harvesting of stem cells. Partial birth abortion should never be considered for this harvesting. To do so would be condoning murder.  Thank you very much Mr. Kerry for listening to someone who hopes you will be a good President of the United States of America and live up to your word. We truly indeed “should be on the side of God” for our nation, for each other, and for the betterment of humanity.  We should be concerned with removing the plank from our own eye before we turn our attention to our brother’s splinter, as the verse says.  Sincerely, A Voter         This is a copy of a letter written by a dear friend of mine.  In following her example, I believe I too will write a letter to John Forbes Kerry.  Perhaps he really and truly is the JFK of this generation.

       Beginning next week,  The Kentucky Mountain Girl News   is going to have its changes complete and under way. Outside submissions will begin to be printed, as well as my own ramblings, poetry, and fiction. So, I hope all writers will submit something to The News, because she is going to need it.       I am actually quite excited about this change. Not only am I gaining valuable experience, a bi-line myself, and loving every single second of this new phase of The News, there will be opportunities for people to submit their work, receive a bi-line, and help someone else's portfolio to increase. To me it appears to be a win/win scenario.      To further this advance, I have linked  urlLink www.Ralan.com  with The News and hopefully writers will begin submitting.      What else can I say, except: Show me what you have! Let's enjoy this adventure together!

        A  Wish       By Henrietta Asher Handy      Copyright&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;2004 by Henrietta Asher Handy   If I had a wish to make  Guaranteed of its fulfillment  What risk would I take?  Or would any risk be taken?  Would I wish for perfect health for myself or another?  Would I wish for unending wealth so cold would pass over us in the winter?  Would I require world peace so that none would take a life  From north, south, west or east?  In that moment would I ask for the rejuvenation and health needed for you  Making living for you a joy and not a task?  If one good wish could ever be used with promise of it happening  I’m not sure for what to ask, because so much could we lose.  Each moment requires a decision,  Forcing us our free will to use;  And there, within ourselves, lies the division.  So, please, don’t give me that question to decide:  I could be selfish, or self-less;  Either way, part of me would hide.        &nbsp;   My cousin who is undergoing radiation treatments has decided to fight.&nbsp; Some people are upset by it, saying that isn't what he wanted to do.&nbsp; Regardless of what he  may  have said in the past, this is the present, and he has decided to fight for a few more days, months, or perhaps years of his life.     &nbsp;   Yes, he is going to become very sick with the radiation treatments.&nbsp; Still, he has made a choice and we, as family and friends, should respect that and stand by him, giving him as much support and all the love we can muster.     &nbsp;   It isn't easy facing what he is facing.&nbsp; It isn't easy watching him have to go through this.&nbsp; Still, the situation is present and people around him have a choice.&nbsp; Be combative, or be supportive.&nbsp; My personal vote is for support.     &nbsp;   How often I have seen my Mom in the past almost weep with all the advice she had been given.&nbsp; Everyone was telling her different things and, in the end it didn't really matter because she couldn't make too many decisions herself.&nbsp; So, all stood by her and helped her.&nbsp; Loved her.&nbsp; My stance was firmly taken, and it is firmly taken with my cousin.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   At the same time I wonder, if I could make a wish ....     &nbsp;  ************    Open Call

        Posted July 27, 2004, 12:06 AM EDT     The following is a transcript of a speech by William J. Clinton at the Democratic National Convention:     Thank you.&nbsp; I am honored to share the podium with my Senator, though I think I should be introducing her. I'm proud of her and so grateful to the people of New York that the best public servant in our family is still on the job and grateful to all of you, especially my friends from Arkansas, for the chance you gave us to serve our country in the White House.        &nbsp;    I am also honored to share this night with President Carter, who has inspired the world with his work for peace, democracy, and human rights. And with Al Gore, my friend and partner for eight years, who played such a large role in building the prosperity and progress that brought America into the 21st century, who showed incredible grace and patriotism under pressure, and who is the living embodiment that every vote counts -- and must be counted in every state in America.        &nbsp;    Tonight I speak as a citizen, returning to the role I have played for most of my life as a foot soldier in the fight for our future, as we nominate a true New England patriot for president. The state that gave us John Adams and John Kennedy has now given us John Kerry, a good man, a great senator, a visionary leader. We are constantly told America is deeply divided. But all Americans value freedom, faith, and family. We all honor the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world.        &nbsp;    We all want good jobs, good schools, health care, safe streets, a clean environment. We all want our children to grow up in a secure America leading the world toward a peaceful future. Our differences are in how we can best achieve these things, in a time of unprecedented change. Therefore, we Democrats will bring the American people a positive campaign, arguing not who's good and who's bad, but what is the best way to build the safe, prosperous world our children deserve.        &nbsp;    The 21st century is marked by serious security threats, serious economic challenges, and serious problems like global warming and the AIDS epidemic. But it is also full of enormous opportunities-to create millions of high paying jobs in clean energy, and biotechnology; to restore the manufacturing base and reap the benefits of the global economy through our diversity and our commitment to decent labor and environmental standards everywhere; and to create a world where we can celebrate our religious and racial differences, because our common humanity matters more.        &nbsp;    To build that kind of world we must make the right choices; and we must have a president who will lead the way. Democrats and Republicans have very different and honestly held ideas on that choices we should make, rooted in fundamentally different views of how we should meet our common challenges at home and how we should play our role in the world. Democrats want to build an America of shared responsibilities and shared opportunities and more global cooperation, acting alone only when we must.        &nbsp;    We think the role of government is to give people the tools and conditions to make the most of their lives. Republicans believe in an America run by the right people, their people, in a world in which we act unilaterally when we can, and cooperate when we have to.        &nbsp;    They think the role of government is to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of those who embrace their political, economic, and social views, leaving ordinary citizens to fend for themselves on matters like health care and retirement security. Since most Americans are not that far to the right, they have to portray us Democrats as unacceptable, lacking in strength and values. In other words, they need a divided America. But Americans long to be united. After 9/11, we all wanted to be one nation, strong in the fight against terror. The president had a great opportunity to bring us together under his slogan of compassionate conservatism and to unite the world in common cause against terror.Instead, he and his congressional allies made a very different choice: to use the moment of unity to push America too far to the right and to walk away from our allies, not only in attacking Iraq before the weapons inspectors finished their jobs, but in withdrawing American support for the Climate Change Treaty, the International Court for war criminals, the ABM treaty, and even the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.Now they are working to develop two new nuclear weapons which they say we might use first. At home, the President and the Republican Congress have made equally fateful choices indeed. For the first time ever when America was on a war footing, there were two huge tax cuts, nearly half of which went to the top one percent. I'm in that group now for the first time in my life.        &nbsp;    When I was in office, the Republicans were pretty mean to me. When I left and made money, I became part of the most important group in the world to them. At first I thought I should send them a thank you note -- until I realized they were sending you the bill.        &nbsp;    They protected my tax cuts while:        &nbsp;    -- Withholding promised funding for the Leave No Child Behind Act, leavingover 2 million children behind        &nbsp;    -- Cutting 140,000 unemployed workers out of job training        &nbsp;    -- 100,000 working families out of child care assistance        &nbsp;    -- 300,000 poor children out of after school programs        &nbsp;    -- Raising out of pocket healthcare costs to veterans        &nbsp;    -- Weakening or reversing important environmental advances for clean airand the preservation of our forests.        &nbsp;    Everyone had to sacrifice except the wealthiest Americans, who wanted to do their part but were asked only to expend the energy necessary to open the envelopes containing our tax cuts. If you agree with these choices, you should vote to return them to the White House and Congress. If not, take a look at John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democrats.        &nbsp;    In this year's budget, the White House wants to cut off federal funding for 88,000 uniformed police, including more than 700 on the New York City police force who put their lives on the line on 9/11. As gang violence is rising and we look for terrorists in our midst, Congress and the President are also about to allow the ten-year-old ban on assault weapons to expire. Our crime policy was to put more police on the streets and take assault weapons off the streets. It brought eight years of declining crime and violence. Their policy is the reverse, they're taking police off the streets and putting assault weapons back on the streets. If you agree with their choices, vote to continue them. If not, join John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democrats in making America safer, smarter, and stronger.        &nbsp;    On Homeland Security, Democrats tried to double the number of containers at ports and airports checked for Weapons of Mass Destruction. The one billion dollar cost would have been paid for by reducing the tax cut of 200,000 millionaires by five thousand dollars each. Almost all 200,000 of us would have been glad to pay 5,000 dollars to make the nearly 300 million Americans safer-but the measure failed because the White House and the Republican leadership in the House decided my tax cut was more important -- If you agree with that choice, re-elect them. If not, give John Kerry and John Edwards a chance.        &nbsp;    These policies have turned the projected 5.8 trillion dollar surplus we left-enough to pay for the baby boomers retirement-into a projected debt of nearly 5 trillion dollars, with a 400 plus billion dollar deficit this year and for years to come. How do they pay for it? First by taking the monthly surplus in Social Security payments and endorsing the checks of working people over to me to cover my tax cut. But it's not enough. They are borrowing the rest from foreign governments, mostly Japan and China. Sure, they're competing with us for good jobs but how can we enforce our trade laws against our bankers? If you think it's good policy to pay for my tax cut with the Social Security checks of working men and women, and borrowed money from China, vote for them. If not, John Kerry's your man.        &nbsp;    We Americans must choose for President one of two strong men who both love our country, but who have very different worldviews: Democrats favor shared responsibility, shared opportunity, and more global cooperation. Republicans favor concentrated wealth and power, leaving people to fend for themselves and more unilateral action. I think we're right for two reasons: First, America works better when all people have a chance to live their dreams. Second, we live in an interdependent world in which we can't kill, jail, or occupy all our potential adversaries, so we have to both fight terror and build a world with more partners and fewer terrorists. We tried it their way for twelve years, our way for eight, and then their way for four more.        &nbsp;    By the only test that matters, whether people were better off when we finished than when we started, our way works better-it produced over 22 million good jobs, rising incomes, and 100 times as many people moving out of poverty into the middle class. It produced more health care, the largest increase in college aid in 50 years, record home ownership, a cleaner environment, three surpluses in a row, a modernized defense force, strong efforts against terror, and an America respected as a world leader for peace, security and prosperity.        &nbsp;    More importantly, we have great new champions in John Kerry and John Edwards. Two good men with wonderful wives-Teresa a generous and wise woman who understands the world we are trying to shape. And Elizabeth, a lawyer and mother who understands the lives we are all trying to lift. Here is what I know about John Kerry. During the Vietnam War, many young men -- including the current president, the vice president and me-could have gone to Vietnam but didn't. John Kerry came from a privileged background and could have avoided it too. Instead he said, send me.        &nbsp;    When they sent those swift-boats up the river in Vietnam, and told them their job was to draw hostile fire-to show the American flag and bait the enemy to come out and fight-John Kerry said, send me. When it was time to heal the wounds of war and normalize relations with Vietnam-and to demand an accounting of the POWs and MIAs we lost there-John Kerry said, send me.        &nbsp;    When we needed someone to push the cause of inner-city kids struggling to avoid a life of crime, or to bring the benefits of high technology to ordinary Americans, or to clean the environment in a way that creates jobs, or to give small businesses a better chance to make it, John Kerry said send me.        &nbsp;    Tonight my friends, I ask you to join me for the next 100 days in telling John Kerry's story and promoting his plans. Let every person in this hall and all across America say to him what he has always said to America: Send Me. The bravery that the men who fought by his side saw in battle I've seen in the political arena. When I was President, John Kerry showed courage and conviction on crime, on welfare reform, on balancing the budget at a time when those priorities were not exactly a way to win a popularity contest in our party.        &nbsp;    He took tough positions on tough problems. John Kerry knows who he is and where he's going. He has the experience, the character, the ideas and the values to be a great President. In a time of change he has two other important qualities: his insatiable curiosity to understand the forces shaping our lives, and a willingness to hear the views even of those who disagree with him. Therefore his choices will be full of both conviction and common sense.        &nbsp;    He proved that when he picked a tremendous partner in John Edwards. Everybody talks about John Edwards' energy, intellect, and charisma. The important thing is how he has used his talents to improve the lives of people who -- like John himself -- had to work hard for all they've got. He has always championed the cause of people too often left out or left behind. And that's what he'll do as our Vice President.        &nbsp;    Their opponents will tell you to be afraid of John Kerry and John Edwards, because they won't stand up to the terrorists -- don't you believe it. Strength and wisdom are not conflicting values -- they go hand in hand. John Kerry has both. His first priority will be keeping America safe. Remember the scripture: Be Not Afraid.        &nbsp;    John Kerry and John Edwards, have good ideas:        &nbsp;    -- To make this economy work again for middle-class Americans        &nbsp;    -- To restore fiscal responsibility        &nbsp;    -- To save Social Security; to make healthcare more affordable and collegemore available        &nbsp;    -- To free us from dependence on foreign oil and create new jobs in cleanenergy        &nbsp;    -- To rally the world to win the war on terror and to make more friendsand fewer terrorists.        &nbsp;    At every turning point in our history we the people have chosen unity over division, heeding our founders' call to America's eternal mission: to form a more perfect union, to widen the circle of opportunity, deepen the reach of freedom, and strengthen the bonds of community.        &nbsp;    It happened because we made the right choices. In the early days of the republic, America was at a crossroads much like it is today, deeply divided over whether or not to build a real nation with a national economy, and a national legal system. We chose a more perfect union.In the Civil War, America was at a crossroads, divided over whether to save the union and end slavery -- we chose a more perfect union. In the 1960s, America was at a crossroads, divided again over civil rights and women's rights. Again, we chose a more perfect union. As I said in 1992, we're all in this together; we have an obligation both to work hard and to help our fellow citizens, both to fight terror and to build a world with more cooperation and less terror. Now again, it is time to choose.        &nbsp;    Since we're all in the same boat, let us chose as the captain of our ship a brave good man who knows how to steer a vessel though troubled waters to the calm seas and clear skies of our more perfect union. We know our mission. Let us join as one and say in a loud, clear voice: Send John Kerry.     Copyright © 2004,  urlLink Newsday, Inc.

       I am not a political person.&nbsp; Yeah, I know, I said that before.&nbsp; If I'm not a political person, then why am I paying so much attention to events I normally wouldn't?&nbsp; Take the DNC (Democratic National Convention) for example.&nbsp; I didn't get to watch any of it last night and I was very disappointed!&nbsp; That isn't me.&nbsp; Is it?&nbsp; I mean, wanting to hear some of the speeches doesn't make me heading toward the political arena does it?     &nbsp;   What I think is happening is that I am learning more and more about myself.&nbsp; I say I am a conservative liberal politically.&nbsp; I disagree with a lot of what goes on in the political world, yet I am very conservative when it comes to using abortion as a means of birth control.&nbsp; Men and women should take a little more responsibility there, but in some cases I understand it needs to be present.&nbsp; I am not in favor of partial birth abortions - the baby (and it is a baby) is permitted to be born to a certain level before it is killed.&nbsp; It doesn't matter how much you want to argue, that's just wrong to me.&nbsp; Of course, these are my own opinions and I don't try to shove them down anyone else's throat.&nbsp; It is ok with me if you disagree, just don't try to make me believe your way.&nbsp; I guess I have a live-and-let-live attitude.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   All of this, of course, is just an example I am using to point out my "conservative liberal" tag I just placed on myself.&nbsp;     I was very disappointed when I didn't get to hear Barrack Obama's speech.&nbsp; I was very disappointed I didn't get to hear Teresa Heinz Kerry's speech.&nbsp; Go figure.     &nbsp;   Could it be (I shudder at the thought) I am actually beginning to think my opinion matters, or my vote?&nbsp; I am not a Democrat, I am not a Republican, but I am very interested in what is going on in my nation at the moment.&nbsp; Something needs to give, and give in a good way.&nbsp; I can't help but wonder if Bush will attempt another political coupe like he did the last election and if, maybe, just maybe, John Kerry is the Kennedy for this nation now.&nbsp; (Hopefully he will have better success than JFK did.)     &nbsp;   I mean, really, look at the similarities between the two.&nbsp; Both of them are war vets.&nbsp; Both of them are going against the grain, yet gaining momentum as the election nears.&nbsp; Both of them are extremely handsome, and both seem to have ideals they are really willing to work toward.&nbsp; For some reason I see hope with John Kerry and not so much hope with Pres. Bush.     &nbsp;   Wow, I just endorsed someone.&nbsp; I'd better stop while I still feel relatively clean.

       Last night, as hubby and I were preparing for bed, I flipped on the TV in the bedroom just to see what gobbledy gook was happening at the Democratic Convention.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I am not partisan to any party, and am still holding firm to the theory the popular vote should actually be given more credence in hiring a President for the nation.&nbsp; We are, after all, firmly rooted in an information and technological age and not scattered about having to rely upon trains for the post or horses.&nbsp; So, in many respects, I find politics laughable and sometimes downright amusing,&nbsp;until politicians and their stupid ideas make me angry.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Last night I was counting on some amusement before bed when I turned on the TV.&nbsp; What I discovered was an Orator.&nbsp; Bill Clinton.     &nbsp;   Many things he said I found myself agreeing with.&nbsp; His impassioned speech made my jaw drop and made both myself and my hubby to sit down and listen to what he had to say.&nbsp; His speech so moved me, I actually went looking for a transcript of it and will post it verbatim, if you missed it, in another post of The News, or perhaps directly following this.     &nbsp;   Some of the things he said made me laugh.&nbsp; He made me  care  about what was happening in this country politically and even gave me pause to think, just possibly, I  could  affect it in a positive manner.     &nbsp;   Mr. Clinton said,  "We are constantly told America is deeply divided. But all Americans value freedom, faith, and family. We all honor the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world."&nbsp;  I found myself agreeing.&nbsp; It also made me think, perhaps America isn't going to crap after all ... just maybe it isn't.     &nbsp;   He further said, in another part of his speech,   The 21st century is marked by serious security threats, serious economic challenges, and serious problems like global warming and the AIDS epidemic. But it is also full of enormous opportunities-to create millions of high paying jobs in clean energy, and biotechnology; to restore the manufacturing base and reap the benefits of the global economy through our diversity and our commitment to decent labor and environmental standards everywhere; and to create a world where we can celebrate our religious and racial differences, because our common humanity matters more.   Again I found myself nodding, because I have often thought the same thing.&nbsp; And often wondered  Why doesn't the government DO something with all the knowledge we have?      &nbsp;   The thing that made my mouth drop open most was when Mr. Clinton spoke of Viet Nam and how he had "avoided" going, but Kerry hadn't.&nbsp; To hear someone admit,&nbsp;especially a political figure, that he had avoided going to Viet Nam takes courage, in my book, for being so honest.&nbsp; I was simply blown away by his speaking and still am.&nbsp; My desire to read his book has now increased 100 fold.     &nbsp;   Lawrence C. Levy said in his own Blog,  " Bill Clinton's speech was enough to make anyone forget anything but what an incredible communicator he was -- and how he had raised the bar even higher for John Kerry when the candidate gives his acceptance speech Thursday ." &nbsp; He is right.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Bill Clinton spoke eloquently, passionately, and confidently.&nbsp; He didn't beat you over the head with his words, he laid them out before you for you to make a decision and a choice.&nbsp; In doing this he was far more eloquent in swaying thoughts and ideas, because he was encouraging everyone for his party candidate, yet also came across to tell fellow Americans he had made a choice and he thought it was a good one.&nbsp; Bill Clinton stirred the hearts, minds, and souls of those who heard him, and, whether or not it was for a political agenda of his own or not didn't seem to matter.&nbsp; This doesn't happen often, and I don't believe it will happen again, unless Bill Clinton, perhaps, is doing the speaking.&nbsp;

      Ok, since publishing "Johnny Cash Wouldn't Lie" I have had several questions concerning *gasp* submissions to The Kentucky Mountain Girl News.   It was always a possibility I could open this up to outside sources so, perhaps a small step in that direction wouldn't be such a bad idea.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't be paying anyone, but you "could" have a bi-line, which is always helpful in building a portfolio of your published works, which is something editors really look at.   SO, here is the dish:  If you have something you would like to submit to The Kentucky Mountain Girl News, email me at  urlLink hahwriter@yahoo.com  and I will send you guidelines.  As it stands right now, I am open to considering poetry and short fiction, less than 5000 words.  No profanity, unless it is really necessary for the story.  No fan fiction, unless it is really, really, really good and can make me change my mind about it.  Poetry 46 lines max.  Non-fiction, please query.  Whoever is published here retains all rights to their work.   I guess that's in for the "guidelines" possibility, but, just send me an email.  If you want to actually submit something, put it in the body of the email itself and make sure you have something (asterisks or something) showing me where there should be italics.  And, please, double-space between paragraphs.  Thanks.

       Today is one of those days where, when I look out my window I miss seeing the summer green hills of my native home.&nbsp; Here I live on a street and look out my window upon houses and sometimes people moving about.&nbsp; Back Home I lived on a creek beside a road and&nbsp;right beside one of my beloved Kentucky mountains.&nbsp; I was surrounded by them on every side it seemed.&nbsp; The road made a twitchy space between them, following the shallow creek as it burbled along its path of unknown ages.     &nbsp;   I miss my hills, my Kentucky mountains.&nbsp; Sometimes, like today, more than others.&nbsp;       &nbsp;      &nbsp;     Pauses       By Henrietta Asher Handy      Copyright (c) 2004 by Henrietta Asher Handy   In the spring, covered in blossoms,  My old friends speak to me  Of times passed  Futures coming  Worries gone.   In the summer, covered in varying shades of green,  My old friends speak to me  Of joys near, just around the bend,  And passing moments  To be savored like the perfect morning,   The moment  The moment when  Nothing is impossible  And nothing is quite as dank and dark.   In the fall, dappled with patchwork quilts,  My old friends speak to me  Of Time’s existence  How it is present, simmering,  Cooling down.   In the winter, covered white,  My old friends speak to me  Of slumbering sad  Waiting for the better times to come  Just shy of distant.  &nbsp;    Do not reprint without my permission.&nbsp; Thank you.

             Shane Stewart is a fellow writer and a good friend of mine.&nbsp; He has listened to me cry on the phone several times over the recent happenings in my life and has also been the best friend of hubby for many years; he has also led many a&nbsp;D&D role-playing session for me and many friends.&nbsp; He sent something to me which I am posting here.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.      Do not republish.&nbsp; This is not my work and I do not claim any copyrights to this material.   &nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;     Johnny Cash Wouldn't Lie     By Shane Stewart    Copyright (c) 2004 by Shane Stewart     &nbsp;   I can't remember when I was last this cold.    Don't really know when the ice    Got built up so far.    It's thick.&nbsp; Heavy.    I've been caked in ice before,    But never this much.    How do I move in all this ice?    How can I move and still be this cold?    Moving should move my blood.    Moving should warm me.    It does not.    I shake continually.    My skin always crawls,    My blood is always chilled.    I only vaguely remember    Being warm.&nbsp; Safe.&nbsp; Happy.    I think I'll be warm again.    The Man in Black told me so,    Just after the winter set in,    I heard the song.    Devils and fiddles and rematches and practices.    I heard it.&nbsp; I heard him.&nbsp; Dawn comes,    That's what he said.    Dawn comes.    The Man in Black told me -    After the dark, cold hours,    Dawn comes.      &nbsp;      &nbsp;

       On Wednesday&nbsp;I needed to talk to some old friends and ended up making two long distance calls.&nbsp; I usually don't make long distance calls.&nbsp; It is much more affordable to wait until time arrives for the free minutes on the cell phone where time, as they say, is free.&nbsp; But, yesterday I needed to ask about a dear friend who has been recently diagnosed with cancer and, on a wild hair, called the doctor that treated my Mommy Back Home.     &nbsp;   I hadn't talked to Dr. V for over eighteen months now and wasn't sure he would remember me.&nbsp; He is from India and practicing in a small mountain community.&nbsp; He didn't make "friends" easily and, although he and I never would admit to being "friends" we had always been on friendly terms, especially about my Mom and her condition.&nbsp; When I needed something for her I could always call him and something good would come out of it, even if it was getting her to the hospital and him talking her into staying.&nbsp; He could handle Mom that way when no one else could.     &nbsp;   As I said, I called him and told him my name and placed it in reference to my mother.&nbsp; Much to my surprise he laughed out loud and said he had time and asked how I was doing.&nbsp; He asked about my health, so we had to have a small conversation over a few minor problems he had seen me for during the time I had stayed with my Mom and I asked about him.     &nbsp;   "I'm not seeing many patients any more," he said.&nbsp; He didn't sound upset or disturbed by it, he was just stating a simple fact in that simple Indian way he had.&nbsp; He didn't explain why and I didn't ask.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Talking to him was a true verbal visit.     &nbsp;   As our conversation progressed he and I ended up on religion in some loose way and I said I was Orthodox.&nbsp; There was a deep silence on the other end of the line, then a tentative, "What type of Orthodox do you mean?"&nbsp; I explained I had converted to Eastern Orththodoxy and heard a surprised gasp.&nbsp; "I'm Orthodox!"&nbsp;     &nbsp;   In all the time we had known each other, this was the first time I had learned he was an Orthodox Christian.&nbsp; In fact, he was a Thomasian Orthodox Christian from India!&nbsp; We talked then of fasting and other items and Dr. V said he had not taken Communion in some time.&nbsp; So, he was armed with my church address and telephone number and the Antiochian website.&nbsp; He laughingly said something about needing Confession and I told him my priest was a very good listener.     &nbsp;   The conversation ended quietly and amicably.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Once I had hung up the phone I was surprised at how close I had been to an Orthodox Christian and had never known it.&nbsp; It was sad in a way, yet, in a way, also appropriate:&nbsp; He did not want to offend anyone and had kept his faith to himself.&nbsp; I hope Dr. V does come to Lexington, it would be absolutely wonderful to see him again.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    "Dr. V" is not his real name or initial, but it works for this story.        &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       It happened very unexpectedly.&nbsp; We were eating dinner.&nbsp; It wasn't anything fancy, just sandwiches and a wonderful salsa hubby had made.&nbsp; I complimented him on how wonderful it was and was contentedly munching away on some tortilla chips.    &nbsp;  "You'll have to fix this for Mohhh...," I said.&nbsp; Both of us froze.&nbsp; I kept my eyes on my plate.&nbsp; I had almost said  You'll have to fix this for Mommy - she would really like this. &nbsp; Hubby's eyes were on me, watching me carefully.&nbsp; I sat for a moment dipping my chip helplessly in the wonderful salsa that had suddenly lost some of its delicious flavor.    &nbsp;  In being apart from him while taking care of Mommy, I had written him many times in my journal, but rarely on paper.&nbsp; Everything I wanted to say seemed to be too personal for letters.&nbsp; In retrospect I know I should have written the letters, let him know just how much I missed him and loved him on a daily basis.&nbsp; In order to fill them I wrote many poems to him, for him.&nbsp; Even after I had returned home I was adjusting with being with him and letting him know within the poetry how much I was hurting, how much I was loving him, how much I longed for something I could not name.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  One poem especially came so deeply from my heart.&nbsp; It was written in a moment when I was certain no one would come for me in the end to rescue me from the horror of what was happening.&nbsp; Of course, no one could do such a thing, yet it was important to put forth what I was needing:    &nbsp;    Hero Wanted   By Henrietta Asher Handy     Copyright (c) 2004 by Henrietta Asher Handy     &nbsp;  Hero wanted:  Must have broad shoulders,  Strong hands,  And a back unafraid of burdens.  Must be willing,  Without complaint,  To have tears spilled  Upon the shoulders and chest,  And arms stout enough  To keep out the cold of life;  Must be willing to face the monster  Even if that monster is me  Applicant must also have a hero’s heart:  Unafraid to love or be afraid,  But strong enough to overcome the fear.  Applicant must possess  Heart-warming smiles for when there are no smiles left  And encouragement when life seems too much.  Those seeking a mother, sister or pal need not apply.  Those unprepared to be challenged, tested and scorched with living  Should stay a safe distance away  So that your dream world will not be threatened.  Only heroes need apply.       &nbsp;  It seemed simultaneously I was learning to believe and love anew, and deal with grief at the same time.    &nbsp;   Do not reprint with permission.

       It is early and I have not yet had my coffee ... yes, I said, coffee ... but my mind is already working on story ideas and such.&nbsp; That is the life of a writer I suppose: always thinking, dreaming, and exploring the life within and without simultaneously.     &nbsp;   Something is developing here with The News, something good.&nbsp; It has given me a creative outlet I wasn't expecting really.&nbsp; When I first opened it I thought it was just another sort of on-line "journal", but it isn't.&nbsp; It is an expression of my thought and thought processes, and creativity in a way I have not experienced before.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Each day there is something new I want to place in The News or think about putting in it.&nbsp; The pieces are not just free flowing, stream-of-consciousness (all the time) writing, but more thought out pieces.     &nbsp;   I read somewhere that if you really want to be published and accepted in the publishing world you have to promote yourself and showcase your work.&nbsp; Perhaps this is what The Kentucky Mountain Girl News is going to do for me.&nbsp; Maybe it is just a nice extra something to do to take up writing time when I really don't want to plug away at scenes and characters and just want to express who I am.&nbsp; All I know is that, with this particular setting, I have come to express myself far more than I ever have  and I am enjoying it .     &nbsp;   If this were a typewriter I would already have wasted almost a ream of paper trying to get thoughts and words right.&nbsp; I would have probably already replaced a typewriter ribbon, because this space is important to me and I want to put things here that count.     &nbsp;   Of course, not EVERYTHING is going to count, or make sense, or people are going to read (like this), but I hope a good chunk of it will.&nbsp; I hope when you, anyone, someone reads this they can come away with it thinking they have visited a place where someone may just be thinking, questioning, and asking&nbsp;just as many questions as they are.     &nbsp;   Seeing things differently, having a different take on things has never been very difficult for me.&nbsp; Having the courage and tenacity to say what I am thinking in a non-fiction format has always been hard.&nbsp; Maybe this Blog will break that for me, and help someone else, or at the very least amuse them, you.     &nbsp;   So, what does all of this prattle have to do with anything?&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure, but we will hopefully be discovering it together.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Just for the record:&nbsp; I'm glad this isn't a typewriter, but I do miss the clickity-clack of the typewriter keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Now I'm going to get COFFEE!

       For six years I watched as my mother slowly deteriorated from a vibrant, saucy individual to someone who could not take care of herself and was cared for because of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, and&nbsp;kidney failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   For a little over a year I stayed with my mother, leaving my husband behind to take care of our house and animals; and staying with her, caring for her until my own health ran out.&nbsp; I was recovering my strength when my niece called and said I needed to come home because the time for Mommy's departure had finally arrived.     &nbsp;   I was not prepared, no one truly is honestly. &nbsp;  When my husband and I arrived all of my sisters and their families were present.&nbsp; We embraced, a few quiet tears were shed, but it still wasn't  real  for me.&nbsp; It just wasn't  happening .&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The next day Mommy seemed to get so much better.&nbsp; She was at herself and ... She said her good-byes.&nbsp; After she had said her good-byes she just seemed to rest.&nbsp; A different moment of waiting had begun for us and my husband had to leave and return home to work.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I will never forget the anguished look on his face at leaving me.&nbsp; The end was so very near and he had to be the bread-winner and make the money to keep up our house and keep us fed.&nbsp; As he was pulling out of my Mom's driveway I couldn't help but wonder when I would be calling him to come back?&nbsp; Would he make it home?&nbsp; Would it be later that night, tomorrow morning, the next day?     &nbsp;   Mommy lasted through the day and on through the night.&nbsp; Early the next morning my niece crept into my room.&nbsp; The moment her foot stepped through the threshold I was awake, yet I lay still.&nbsp; Maybe, just maybe she was coming in to get something for Mommy or a blanket for herself?&nbsp; No, she touched my shoulder and my body tensed.     &nbsp;   "Sissy, it's happening," was all she said.     &nbsp;   I got out of bed and went to stand by my Mommy's bedside in the living room where she had been moved so she would always be a part of the life of the house when she could no longer get up and down.&nbsp; She was so very pale and looked so very fragile.&nbsp; My oldest sister was across from me and next to Mommy's head.&nbsp; My niece and another sister was next to me.     &nbsp;   Mommy's eyes were open.&nbsp; Glassy.&nbsp; She seemed to be seeing something we couldn't, and I wondered if my grandmother was close or my uncle that had passed so many years before.&nbsp; Were they closer to the earth waiting for her transition?&nbsp; How many angels were close to us at that moment?&nbsp; How was I actually going to make it without my Mommy, a woman who had always been there in my life?&nbsp; I wondered if&nbsp;yet another&nbsp;sister was going to be able to make it in time from her home to Mommy's before it was all over.&nbsp; (I don't even know when Sister2 actually arrived at the house.)     &nbsp;   My eyes strayed to the rise and fall of her fragile chest.&nbsp; How many times I had lain my head upon her breast in tears and in joy, laughter and sorrow.&nbsp; Mommy gave a gentle sigh,&nbsp;a simple, gentle sigh.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I remember holding my own breath, waiting for her to take another breath, waiting for her to move.&nbsp; Waiting for just one more breath, one more moment....&nbsp; I remember looking to her jugular and seeing it pulse ... one ... two ... three times and then still.     &nbsp;   In a choked voice my oldest sister said, "She's gone girls."&nbsp;     &nbsp;    It's odd.&nbsp; I don't remember most of an entire year afterwards, but I remember these events plainly, distinctly.&nbsp; I remember them just as vividly as I remember Mommy planting her flowers and the vegetable garden and her laugh; of watching her wipe tears of mirth from her eyes on many occasions.&nbsp; I remember how she would laugh with my Dad and make me laugh as well.&nbsp; I remember all of those wonderful times, and I remember this.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  I didn't think I was going to survive waiting for&nbsp;death's arrival.&nbsp; When it came, I was surprised at&nbsp;how still and quiet it was.&nbsp; Part of me shattered and it has taken me a long time to adjust to life as it is now.&nbsp; I think, hope, my Mommy would be proud of her youngest daughter for re-creating her life step-by-step once the fog had&nbsp;somewhat cleared.&nbsp; As always, the written word helped me re-establish myself in the world of the living.    &nbsp;    The Beginnings of Self-Creation      By Henrietta Asher Handy      Copyright (c) 2004 by Henrietta Asher Handy &nbsp;  Standing by your bed, the day you died, the day you fell asleep;  The day you left me forever in this lifetime  I felt the pieces of my world shatter.  It wasn’t my world any more.  It was a mass of strangeness  Of strange familiarities  Of loves found, lost, rediscovered  Life itself was now alien  I had stepped without moving  Becoming someone different  The chrysalis split down the center  And I emerged blinking and blinded  Into this unknown world of existence  And existence, a life without you.  &nbsp;  The pieces of my world, Momma  Were so small, I could not pick them up  Gather them together to rebuild me  Dust remained for most of it –  Butterfly dust of gem colors  Remnants of what once was:  I scooped it all up in a mayonnaise jar –  It sparkled and glistened in the sun.  Sometimes Momma, that’s all the color of my world there was;  All the color I could hold.  &nbsp;  It has been almost a year Momma  And just like yesterday  Now I think I can start to finally heal  Rebuild a world around myself  Perhaps inside myself, too.  The sparkling dust of Use To Be  I place so gently upon the window-pane  There I can see glimpses of what was  As I create what is to be.  &nbsp;  It will take Forever, Momma,  Forever to be whole again  Still, it will take Forever to rebuild  This Life –  It will be forever to get to know this new Me, this new world  This world I live in without you.  &nbsp;  Bathe I in the butterfly dust of Used To Be  Sewing and painting the colors of now  And hurt just a little less each day  Though some days I hurt just a little more  So begins the acceptance of the creature  The Creature that is now ME  &nbsp;  I hope you’re proud of me, Momma,  Of whom it is I am to become.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;           &nbsp;     Please do not reprint without my express permission.&nbsp; Thank you.

       Alien Sky   By Henrietta Asher Handy &nbsp;   Sometimes when I look up  And see the expanse above  I can’t help but wonder  If we, as human beings,  Have always been here,  Looking up at the brilliant blueness  And the velvety purpleness dotted with diamond stars.  &nbsp;  When we fell from Perfection  Did we truly fall?  Fall to this place and time  This dimension Imperfect?  From that time, have we looked up and seen a new sky?  Have we looked upon an alien something?  &nbsp;  By our own ancestral greed  Something Glorious was lost.  You don’t have to fly planes  Fight wars  Kill innocents along with the guilty  To know something is missing  Something has been lost.  &nbsp;  Religion tries to explain it;  Philosophy seeks to rationalize  The awkward akimbo we feel.  We can change – we are no dependent  On anything –  Our destinies are our own  And none can succeed unless they try.  &nbsp;  Succeed at what?  Where is our place?  Each of us feels a loss.  Each of us has looked up and wondered  “What was it like Before?”  We know, in some hidden part,  There has been a Before for us.  &nbsp;  When we fell from Grace,  Did we land in this place?  To look up at the beauty, the blue  And know its imperfection too?  Is that why we long for something unexplainable?  Someone, Some place currently Unattainable?  Somewhere beyond an alien sky?  Where our Imperfection does not lie;  Where feet do not touch ground or sod,  And we may partake of all that is…God?&nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Do not reprint without my express permssion; from  Living Through the Dying . &nbsp; Does anyone else wonder these things besides me?

       I think I am just trying to avoid getting into the nitty gritty of the play, so, I thought I would just post something of my poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not reprint without my express permission first. &nbsp; Hopefully one day these poems will be published in a collection, until then, I hope someone enjoys them.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  They were written while going through the process of caring for my Mom, then losing her, and then grieving.&nbsp; If it is ever published I hope it will be called  Living Through the Dying.     &nbsp;    Mommy is Ailing  &nbsp; By Henrietta Asher Handy &nbsp;    When did it happen?  When did I become the adult?  I never expected to be so.  You were always the one to make it better.  You were always the one who had the answers to life’s questions.  You answered, “Because I’m the Mommy.”  Now I am the one with the answers and you with the questions.  You look to me for decisions to keep you safe.  The world has changed beyond your understanding,  But not your comprehension:  It is familiar to you and yet so strange.  &nbsp;  I look into your eyes and wonder,  Will I be so bold and tenacious at your age?  Or will I give in to what besets me?  Will there be anyone there for me to make the decisions,  To bring the medications to keep me alive when I cannot remember,  To soothe the worries of moments forgotten;  Of words from others who do not realize how badly they hurt?  I see the trust in you for me and I am afraid.  Am I truly worth such a gift you give to me?  So I inhale the wondrous memories of what is now,  Exhaling the sorrows to come.  &nbsp;  I have heard people say in voices soft,  “Mommy is ailing.”  I have seen their fears and their shame.  I have seen them yell at the forgetfulness of time’s passing,  Forgetting that once such arms held and comforted.  Yes Mommy, you are ailing,  But I am proud to stand here with you.  I will answer the questions and thousand times a thousand and more  Merely because you did so for me.  I will love you just simply because you are who you are:  You are the Mommy.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Things are under construction here a little today.&nbsp; Since I'm going to be staying with The News for a while I decided it would be good to have something I really, really liked, so, here we go.&nbsp; Bear with me and everything will be back to normal-ish soon, I promise.

      I received a comment to the piece I had written about Virginia Woolf.&nbsp; It was from Alex, a fellow Blogger ( Dylex  linked on my page).&nbsp; He said, and I quote:  &nbsp;      I think that you are just realizing that none of us are cardboard characters. It has been my observation that most writers that are perceived as "successful" have had a series of "challenges" that have either "revealed" themselves / human nature or allowed them to truly examine how that "event" ultimately came to pass in terms of steps of a drama and "character" development which is always the basis of a "hot" story. In other words a writer has to be a little "off the wall"!!

       First of all, let me say I am very surprised to see a change in how the Blogger page looks.&nbsp; It took me a moment to make certain I was really where I needed to be.&nbsp; This is going to be most interesting and fun.&nbsp;  Thank you Blogger staff!!!!!!!    &nbsp;   I miss my coffee.&nbsp; I miss my coffee today more, it seems than I've missed it in a while.&nbsp; There isn't any real reason why I couldn't have some here at the house, but, for some reason, every time I or hubby goes to the grocery for one reason or another we either forget, leave it alone because it costs too much for our budget for the week, or we're in too much of a hurry.&nbsp; Today, however, I am missing my coffee so much I am seriously contemplating just getting a small jar of instant coffee and just keeping it here, safe and hidden, for my use only, for the serious writing days.     &nbsp;   There is something about having a steaming cup of coffee while you are plotting out scenes and dialogue.&nbsp; It makes the job easier to do, or it flows a little better than it otherwise would.&nbsp; Some people have cigarettes, others their wine, for me it is coffee.&nbsp; And I need my coffee today.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; My play.     &nbsp;   The play is causing me fits and starts and making me want to quit one moment.&nbsp; When I walk away from it to do something else, a line will float to the forefront and I will be back to work on the thing with love and even more patience.     &nbsp;   I can  see  the people, the stage, and how it should happen.&nbsp; I can  hear  the voices and how they should sound.&nbsp; It is as if it is all unfolding before me and at moments it frightens me and causes me to simply feel over-joyed at how well it is working - even though there is little more than a page accomplished for how long I am working on it.&nbsp; For these moments a nice steaming cup of coffee would definitely come in handy.     &nbsp;   A part of me, perhaps, has finally grown up and decided to write what makes me happy and maybe the world will enjoy it as well.&nbsp; Maybe somewhere in the past I have so tried to change, to fit into someone else's mold my own voice was lost.&nbsp; Now at my current age, my voice is returning.&nbsp; Now I see all I need to do is please myself and all can be better if I speak in my own way and say what I truly want to say.&nbsp; It would definitely be better this morning with a nice strong cup of black coffee.

      I have begun researching Virginia Woolf since seeing  The Hours .  I'm not exactly sure why; well, perhaps in part I know why.  She wrote all her life and our lives, hers and mine, seem to have a few similarities, and quite a few differences.  The more I am finding out about her the more I am trying to decide if I would like her as a person.  With Emily Dickenson I can say, yes, I would probably like her as a person.  With Charles Dickens I can likewise say I would like him as a person, but there is something about Virginia Woolf I cannot quite put my finger on that holds me back from saying this.  She was born in the latter portion of the Victorian era and wrote from the age of 3 on (so have I).  She suffered from manic depression possibly, at the very least depression and "a nervous constitution" on occasion and "lapses of sanity" which, when you look at them makes me wonder if she really did or was she so fed up with the world she just let go and was perceived as being insane by the time in which she lived?  This I will have to research some more.  She challenged the norm for women writers and was part of the (in)famouse Bloomsbury Group, which she seems to have been a ring-leader of.  The part that is truly causing me to take point and stop, look at her more closely, is her flipancy and her callousness toward people she considered "friends".  The Bloomsbury Group actually  enjoyed  insulting one another and trying to bring each other down.  I have been unfortunate enough to have been on the outer edges of such a group and, like the Bloomsbury Group, if you did not show your wit in defending yourself you were not admitted within the group.  Whether it was fortuitous or not, I was admitted into the group and always had to watch my back and listen to the words spoken to make certain I did not miss a double meaning and be ready for a come-back and be ready to insult someone else.  It was not a pleasant place to be, luckily I am free of it now and the people I care most for are likewise free of it.  The Bloomsbury Group were like this from everything I have read so far.  In discovering this about them it has lowered my estimation of these wonderful writers somewhat.  The works of art are magnificient, but what of these peoples' lives?  How sad were they really?  It makes me wonder.  It makes me want to find out so much more about them ... almost.  Even though I think there might be something unsatisfactory in Virginia Woolf herself, I can't help but feel drawn to her, as if there is something akin between us.  Sometimes I feel, if I let myself, I can genuinely understand her darkness and that frightens me.  Perhaps this is what is causing me such problems.  The closeness of darkness between us.  It is time to go on and finish my research and see what turns up; at this point in time all I'm doing is merely working on half information which leads to ill-formed conclusions.  If, then I am seeing similarities between us, does this mean I might not be liking something in myself?  Hesitantly I would have to answer ....  Yes.

      As I am becoming more and more comfortable "Blogging" and learning about the tool of my decided "publication", I am finding, or  discovering  little things about the Blogging tool most probably already know (not to mention things about myself).  It just startled me to discover the "draft" function publishes the piece for the day you saved it, not the day you post it.    This leads me to go into a different place to create, save, and edit some of my Blog material.  How odd a discovery to make!  Are all discoverys "odd"?    Does an adventurer say each and every time he finds something new, "Remarkable!" or "How odd"?  For some reason I imagine he (or she) does.  Now I return you back to your regularly sceduled reading lives.  (And no, I am not quite so bored today, just trying to get things arranged for tomorrow, which will have yet  another  entry!  Mwaaaahhahahaha!)

      It stormed last night.  Hard.  The thunder crashed and the lightning flashed and it made me jump.  I've never been a big lover of storms as some people claim to be.  Watching them on the big screen or TV is fine, but when it comes to being in one or being here at the house while one is happening, well, I'd prefer it to be calm.  One particular crash of thunder sounded as if it was coming straight for the house and was going to bowl it over and take most of the street with it.  The lightning was dancing through the clouds and making them look blue-gray in the darkness.  I could almost remember every single scary movie I had ever seen with that rolling mass so far above my head as I jumped, startled by its noise.  Hubby and I were just lying down, preparing for sleep and he was talking on the cell phone to a friend far away who wasn't undergoing a storm.  I wanted to scream and cry like a little girl, but also didn't want to face the ridicule since I am so  not  one (a little girl I mean).  Still, the panic was there.  I moved, shifted in the bed, and caught sight of myself in the dresser mirror.  I was shocked at how calm my outside appeared.  There was nothing there, not even in my eyes to belie how close to terrified I was heading.   Carefully I turned over onto my stomach and fought the urge to cover up my head with my pillow to block out the noise and wished my Mommy was here; wished I could hear her voice and her reassurances and her laughter.  I wished I could hear Daddy's stories of the storms he had to walk through as a child.  Tears were so terribly close to spilling over as I longed for them, wished for them, then such a calm came over me as an even BIGGER crash stole over my house and street.  A calm, still little voice surfaced somewhere inside me shushing my fears and eased down the tears.   Your Mommy  and  Daddy are with the Maker of the Storms.     Suddenly I wasn't afraid any more.  I knew Mommy and Daddy would always be praying for me to God to keep me safe, even in the midst of the most terrible storms.  They are nearer to God now and He can hear them even more than before.  A comfort and peace like I have never known flooded my Soul and heart and mind and I slept.  I slept in perfect peace, just as if Mommy was cradling me in her arms and Daddy was nested beside us on the bed.    My Mommy is with the Maker of the Storms and she is watching over me.  My Daddy is with the Maker of the Storms and he is watching over me, too.  I sort of understand more about the Saints now.

      Have you ever noticed how things have a tendency to work?  Just when you think you're about to overcome (a problem, a mountain, a wall to something), a huge mass of unnamed monstrosity will fly at you from absolutely no where just as you are beginning to stand erect for the first time in...Oh...ages.  That happened to me today.  I was blindsided, and it hurt.  It hurt so very deeply that I sit here before this computer screen and type words that feel like they are my only friends.  It isn't true, of course, but I  feel  like it is.  In a span of a year and a half I have lost my mother, my best friend of 20 years, and now recently my father.  It has taken me a long time to stand upright and feel good about anything.  Today was the first day I stood full erect emotionally and inhaled deeply of what I thought was clean, fresh, safe air.  I felt weights falling off me.    It was a short-lived feeling because that Huge Unnamed Monstrous Mass came flying at me from out of now where and slammed up against something I hadn't even been trying to overcome.  I thought I was ok in that particular department, but obviously I was wrong.  Is it we who wade and fight through what is going on with us, or is it those around us who want to keep us pinned down?  I am seriously beginning to wonder.  None of this makes sense does it.  Maybe, when I stop crying long enough, I will write out everything that happened.

      When I write it seems I have to have some type of music to fill the void of silence.  If the music matches what is happening in the story, or the mood of it, then so much the better.  Today, as I was roaming over Napster (I'm a Premium person) I hit on a group I hadn't heard before, but really should have.  They're called  Mediaeval Babes .  They have such an unusual sound and  they fit what I want to write!     Let me explain ...  There is a particular piece I want to write.  It is something I have actually been working on for quite some time as an idea.  Every time I have tried to work on it before ... the  mood , the  feeling  would just slip through my fingers.  This place is so special and intense for me it has a "soundtrack", of sorts in my head, but I haven't been able to find groups that fit so well with the piece in order to actually 'get into' this world.  Enya works very well, but there should be more.  I have picked and arranged and come up with a decent playlist for the "soundtrack" for writing, but it just wasn't RIGHT, until today.  The music of this group fits so well for the piece, if it is ever made into a movie there is no way this group could not be part of it, along with Enya, and perhaps Annie Lennox.    Yeah, I don't just write - I think of production of the piece later on ... but first I tell the story.  Guess I'm sort of strange like that.    What do you expect really?  I'm a struggling writer, after all.

      I  LOVE  professional wrestling.    I love the hokiness of it; the costumes, the bodies, and the most of the time the trash talk the wrestlers dole out to one another (the times I don't I just hit mute or switch the channel really quick).  Hubby thinks I'm a little cracked, but he puts up with it because he loves his wife.    This love hasn't been a recent development, it has been on-going since I was young, as in back in the 70's when wrestling was really good and geeky and the lines were firmly drawn between good guy and bad guy.  Today those lines are still drawn, just not as well defined as they once were - but I have a theory.  We all know wrestling is a business and the wrestlers are performers, they are physical performers who really do push their bodies to the limit.  The blood shed these days is real and the wrestlers' own.  They learn lines and they choreograph much of what happens in the ring, but not all.  Even though the out-come of many of the matches is known ahead of time, these men and women do give it their all.  No sport is so wracked with injuries as professional wrestling.  Still, these people give their performance and, shall I say, their sport, their very all.  In times of economic hardship and when the populace is looking for entertainment, pro wrestling hits its peak.  Recently it has been down on its luck, but slowly is building up steam again.  Look at what we're faced with as a country and people: war, a possible draft; despite the numbers, not many people have wonderfully paying jobs out there and money is tight.  Enter the wrestlers who fight against their opponents, who face their enemies with their fists, not guns.  They spout words and the good guys back up their words.  The good guys aren't perfectly good and the bad guys are, well, they're  really  bad.  The schticks and gimmicks help make wrestling what it is and help keep it un-real and wonderful to watch.  We need that, I think.  We need the good guy vs. bad guy ideal and we need to see it played out before us, hopefully week to week (but not quite so long as it happens on RAW,  SmackDown!  is the show to watch).    Slowly wrestling is returning to being GOOD, probably because the guy running it sees what the people need.  We need the Old School of wrestling back with gimmicks and schticks and story lines.  We need the good guys and the bad guys.  We need something to take our minds off of all our troubles.  Once, I was really ashamed to like professional wrestling.  It was more than just a "guilty" pleasure.  Now I will stand up and say, "Yes, I like pro wrestling!"  My favorite?  Oh, there are many!  Let's see, there is The Undertaker, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Billy Kidman, (ok, John Cena is gaining on me, but he's still not a favorite), the Dudley Boyz, Randy "Macho Man" Savage, and I could go old school and pull out a lot of names for you, but I won't; and for a bad guy I'm looking to Mordacai and Paul Heyman currently.  I simply cannot wait for Undertaker to wipe the floor with him!  Ok, what does being a wrestling fan (geek) say about me?    ... I'm honest.

      I am sitting here trying to get my motivational fluids going to writing something fictional (who can say this Blog isn't for that matter) and think, think, think until I'm all thunk out - or so it feels.    Sometimes being a writer is hard.  I mean, you have these wonderful ideas sitting at the back of your brain just kanoodling around and fermenting, growing and changing until suddenly vwala, you have a story  idea  and that usually turns into a full fledged story with a beginning, middle and end.  However, there are times when you sit and work with that kanoodling and fermenting and the story just goes limp on you like a kid who doesn't want to do anything.  Or a kitten that goes, let's argravate the momma and see how far we can make her go insane before we love her back into reality again!  Sometimes being a writer is hard.

      Today is Independence Day for the United States of America.  In my family it was always a big deal, especially while my Daddy was healthy and active.  He made sure there was always a big cook-out, chilled watermelon, and, if we could, we went to see the fireworks downtown in Hyden, Kentucky.  If not, he watched the fireworks set off by the neighbor boys.  The Fourth of July was a time to celebrate being free and, in many respects, being alive because he served in World War II and was wounded in it.  Daddy was never talked much about The War.  He served in the Army and received the Bronze Star for bravery, but no one knows what for.  "I'm not proud of what I had to do," he would say.  "I did what needed to be done.  Those other men were just like me," he would say.  Daddy never quite got over the war.  He had nightmares all his life and fire-crackers always seemed to sound like enemy fire at times.  You never touched him to wake him up either - not because Daddy would hurt you, but because it made him react.  We always called to him and woke him that way from a nap.  My Daddy was my hero.  A quiet man in many respects who loved to laugh and pull pranks.  Who did what he needed to do to raise his family, which, for him, was to work in the coal mines to raise four daughters and one son.  We were his pride and joy, and our Mommy was the love of his life.  World War II changed him, as it did many people.  Yet, it didn't take away his spirit or make him cold.  It made him appreciate life in all things.  Daddy said he was not a better man for having gone to war, because killing a man does not make you better, but raising a family made him a better man.  I lost my Daddy on June 5th of this year, 2004.  I am the youngest of his daughters and bear his name.  I am proud to be his namesake and his Baby.  I am proud to be an American woman who respects what he did for me and all his generation.  I only hope and pray this country can continue to keep strong and not lose what it has gained from the sacrifice of men such as my Dad.  Happy Fourth of July.  Happy Independence Day.  God Bless America.

       A while back my friend Ricyos, aka Shane Stewart, wrote something for Memorial Day in his journal and, with his permission, I have posted it here as it is near Independence Day.  It makes you think.   I do not claim any copyright to this piece.  All copyrights remain those solely of the author.

The topic of the night was, as it has been in a lot of places I imagine, the new World War II Veterans memorial in Washington DC.  The thing that caught my attention was when the announcer doing the voice over said, “They’ve been called our greatest generation ever.” It was something to that effect at least – I’m paraphrasing.  At any rate, it’s pretty accurate.  It’s been 60 years, roughly, since the United States entered into the Second World War. Consider those two words for a minute – World War. A war so big that it involves the most powerful nations and armies on the planet. In this day and age of push button convenience, most people imagine that a war that big would be fought with the stroke of a few keys on a keyboard, or the turn of a key. Thermonuclear weapons make the prospect of another World War pretty unlikely, I think. The existence of the weapons discourages any plans for empires – get too happy with conquering your neighbors and a small nuclear explosion will reduce your capital city to a glowing memory. Then of course, there’s the idea that if they are used in wartime, by all sides – or at least multiple sides – it will be the end of world as we know it – either as the end of civilization or the actual destruction of the planet.  The idea of a World War is different now. The consequences are different. A World War in this day and age suggests that a lot of people would die. The planet itself may not be here when the shooting is over.  “Our greatest generation ever.” I think that’s true.  That generation – and others before and after it – fought and bled and died so that I could live as I do today, in a country where I am free to do and think and believe how I wish. Memorial Day is all about remembering those who have gone before – those who have died to defend my future. How do I remember them?  I have things I wish to do, or more accurately, things I want to see with my own two eyes, before it comes time for me to think of ash or earth.   I want to see glaciers. I want to watch an iceberg being born. I want to see Antarctica. I want to see Ayers Rock. I want to see Stonehenge. I want to spend my birthday in Hiroshima, just once. I want to stand among the redwoods. I want to see the rain forest of the Pacific Northwest. I want to see the spiders of the Amazon.  I want to remember those who fought and died to protect my freedom by exercising my freedom.   How will you remember them?

      I believe this is the weekend several things will happen.    1)  I will purchase Bill Clinton's book. 2)  I will select some movies for myself for next week to watch. 3)  Not much writing will get done. 4)  Hopefully hubby and I will get to go downtown for the July 4th celebration beginning tomorrow.  Not very exciting is it?  To you, perhaps, but I've been looking forward to these simple things (except #3).  Why?  Because it seems when I look forward to BIG things, something always falls through, but the simple, little things always seem to come through.  Is it a way we look at them, I wonder, that helps them come to pass?  If the BIG things were looked at with the simple goodness of little things, would they more than likely come to pass?    If we didn't build them up and expect so much from the BIG things, would they make it?  I mean, there is always something going wrong with the big plans I make, and if I'm really, really,  really  looking forward to something it seems the slightest miscalculation can throw off the entire event and make it seem less special than it otherwise was  going  to be.  On the other hand, if I merely look forward to something that isn't that grand in the world's book (or mine for that matter), it comes off without a hitch and I end up having the best time ever.  Not only do  I  have a wonderful time, but it seems everyone else around me does, too.  The pressure is off.  Everyone breathes easier and everyone has a good time without having to fulfill any expectations.  If this is true, I need to put this in practice with everything I do.  Not exactly be carefree and say nothing matters, because lots and lots of ordinary, every day simple things matter; but have the ability to look at things like a child and enjoy everything with the glee and joy of all the goodness of it.  Actually, I'm pretty good at this.  Cheyenne says I "experience" many things instead of just "doing" them.  Maybe, just maybe, if I let myself go and do that with all of life the BIG things would work out just as much as the smaller things.  Either way, I'm looking forward to this weekend, even though hubby must work.

       I copied this straight from  Yahoo! News! .  The only thing I did was bold the title to make it stand out.  I'm not quite sure how I feel about this.  I hope it was peaceful.    Actor Marlon Brando Dies at 80   1 hour, 29 minutes ago  Add Top Stories - AP to My Yahoo!     By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer   LOS ANGELES - Actor Marlon Brando (news) has died at age 80. The death occurred at an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital Thursday, attorney David J. Seeley said Friday. The cause of death was being withheld, Seeley said, noting the actor "was a very private man."   Brando revolutionized American acting with his Method performances in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "On the Waterfront" and went on to create the iconic character of Don Vito Corleone in "The Godfather."    Brando, whose unpredictable behavior made him equally fascinating off the screen, was acclaimed the greatest actor of his generation, a two-time winner of the Academy Award who influenced some of the best actors of the generation that followed, among them Al Pacino, Robert De Niro (news) and Jack Nicholson.    "Marlon would hate the idea of people chiming in to give their comments about his death. All I'll say is that it makes me sad he's gone," said Francis Ford Coppola, who directed "The Godfather."    Brando was the unforgettable embodiment of the brutish Stanley Kowalski of "A Streetcar Named Desire," the mixed up Terry Malloy of "On the Waterfront" (which won him his first Oscar) and the wily Corleone of "The Godfather."    But his private life may best be defined by a line from "The Wild One," in which Brando, playing a motorcycle gang leader, is asked what he's rebelling against.    "Whattaya got?" was his famous reply.    His image was a studio's nightmare. Millions of words were written about his weight, his many romances and three marriages, his tireless — and, for some, tiresome — support of the American Indian and other causes, his battles with film producers and directors, his refuge on a Tahitian isle.    His most famous act of rebellion was his refusal in 1973 to accept the best actor Oscar for "The Godfather." Instead, he sent a woman who called herself Sasheen Littlefeather to read a diatribe about Hollywood's treatment of Native Americans.    It was roundly booed.    Brando's private life turned tragic years later with his son's conviction for killing the boyfriend of his half sister, Cheyenne Brando, in 1990. Five years later, Cheyenne committed suicide, still depressed over the killing.    Still, the undying spotlight never made him conform.    "I am myself," he once declared, "and if I have to hit my head against a brick wall to remain true to myself, I will do it."    Nothing could diminish his reputation as an actor of startling power and invention.    Starting with Kowalski in the stage version of "A Streetcar Named Desire" and a startling series of screen portrayals, Brando changed the nature of American acting.    Schooled at the Actors Studio in New York, he created a naturalism that was sometimes derided for its mumbling, grungy attitudes. But audiences were electrified, and a new generation of actors adopted his style.    "He influenced more young actors of my generation than any actor," longime friend and "Godfather" co-star James Caan (news) said Friday through his publicist. "Anyone who denies this never understood what it was all about."        Marlon Brando Jr. came from the American heartland, born in Omaha, Neb., on April 3, 1924. He was a distant, conservative man of French, English and Irish stock; the original family name was Brandeau.   His mother, the former Dorothy Pennebaker, was small, willowy, compassionate and filled with creative energy. Her ambitions often were unrealized, and she underwent periods of problem drinking. She had given birth to two daughters, Frances and Jocelyn, before Marlon was born.   He grew up a pudgy, mischievous boy who was called Bud to distinguish him from his father. Jocelyn was charged with getting Bud to kindergarten, a difficult task. She solved it by leading him on a leash.   Young Marlon first became exposed to the theater through his mother, who became a leader and occasional actress in the Omaha Community Playhouse. When a leading man dropped out of a play, she pleaded with a young neighbor just home from college to take the role. Henry Fonda (news) reluctantly agreed. Mrs. Brando also encouraged another young Omaha native, Dorothy McGuire.   The lives of Dorothy Brando and her children were upset when the father was transferred to Evanston, Ill., when Bud was 6. The family later moved to Santa Ana, Calif., and finally to Libertyville, Ill.   Bud was constantly being reprimanded for misbehavior at school, infuriating his father. The boy also displayed a talent for playacting, both in elaborate pranks and in plays and recitations. He proved a skilled pantomimist, especially in his depiction of the death of John Dillinger.   His exasperated father sent the boy to military school in an effort to instill discipline. He was expelled. Unable to join the war because of 4-F status, Brando at 19 moved to New York and stayed with his sister Frances, an art student.   Jocelyn Brando studied acting with Stella Adler, and Marlon decided to join her. It changed his life. After a week with the young man, Adler declared: "Within a year, Marlon Brando will be the best young actor in the American theater."   It took longer. He appeared in such plays as "I Remember Mama," "A Flag is Born" (a Jewish pageant with Paul Muni) and "Truckline Cafe." The latter was directed by Elia Kazan, who would remember him for "A Streetcar Named Desire" in 1947.   The Tennessee Williams play made Brando famous, and his first signs of discomfort emerged. The press made much of his motorcycle, leather jackets and T-shirts, his bongo drum playing. He hated the clamor of fans and suffered through interviews.   The image of Stanley seemed to have fallen on Brando, and he once protested to an interviewer: "Kowalski was always right, and never afraid. He never wondered, he never doubted. His ego was very secure. And he had the kind of brutal aggressiveness that I hate. I'm afraid of it. I detest the character."   Brando suffered through the tedium of his two-year contract with "Streetcar," and he never appeared in another play. For his first film he declined several big studio offers and joined independent Stanley Kramer for "The Men" in 1950. To research the story of paraplegic war veterans, he spent a month in a Veterans Administration hospital.   His impact on screen acting was demonstrated by Academy nominations as best actor in four successive years: as Kowalski in "A Streetcar Named Desire" (1951); as the Mexican revolutionary in "Viva Zapata!" (1952); as Marc Anthony in "Julius Caesar" (1953); and as Terry Malloy in "On the Waterfront" (1954).   Although he remained in Hollywood, he refused to be part of it.   "Hollywood is ruled by fear and love of money," he told a reporter. "But it can't rule me because I'm not afraid of anything and I don't love money."   His films after "Waterfront" failed to challenge his unique talent. Most were commercial enterprises: "Desiree," "Guys and Dolls," "The Teahouse of the August Moon," "Sayonara," "The Young Lions." He tried directing himself in a Western, "One-eyed Jacks," going wildly over budget.   A remake of "Mutiny on the Bounty" in 1962, with Brando as Fletcher Christian, seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star. He was blamed for a change in directors and a runaway budget though he disclaimed responsibility for either.   The "Bounty" experience affected Brando's life in a profound way: he fell in love with Tahiti and its people. Tahitian beauty Tarita who appeared in the film became his third wife and mother of two of his children. He bought an island, Tetiaroa, which he intended to make part environmental laboratory and part resort.   Although he remained a leading star, Brando's career waned in the '60s with a series of failures. He was impressive, however, in several movies, among them the comedy "Bedtime Story" and the John Huston drama "Reflections in a Golden Eye."   His box office power seemed finished until Coppola chose him to play Mafia leader Corleone in "The Godfather" in 1972. The film was an overwhelming critical and commercial success and Brando's jowly, raspy-voiced Don became one of the screen's most unforgettable characters.   "I don't think the film is about the Mafia at all," Brando told Newsweek. "I think it is about the corporate mind. In a way, the Mafia is the best example of capitalists we have."   The actor followed with "Last Tango in Paris." One of his greatest performances was overshadowed by an uproar over the erotic nature of the Bernardo Bertolucci film.   In his memoir, "Songs My Mother Taught Me," Brando wrote of being emotionally drained by "Last Tango," an improvised film which included several autobiographical speeches.   Most of his later films were undistinguished. One hundred pounds heavier, he hired himself out at huge salaries for such commercial enterprises as "Superman" and "Christopher Columbus: The Discovery."   He was more effective as the insane army officer in Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" and parodying his "Godfather" role in the hit comedy "The Freshman."   His crusades for civil rights, the American Indian and other causes kept him in the public eye throughout his career. So did his romances and marriages. He married actress Anna Kashfi in 1957, believing her to be East Indian. She was revealed to be Irish, and they separated a year later.   In 1960 he married a Mexican actress, Movita, who had appeared in the first "Mutiny on the Bounty." They were divorced after he met Tarita. All three wives were pregnant when he married them. He had nine children.   In May 1990, Brando's first son, Christian, shot and killed Dag Drollet, 26, the Tahitian lover of Christian's half sister Cheyenne, at the family's hilltop home above Beverly Hills. Christian, 31, claimed the shooting was accidental.   After a heavily publicized trial, Christian was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and use of a gun. He was sentenced to 10 years.   Before the sentencing, Marlon Brando delivered an hour of rambling testimony in which he said he and his ex-wife had failed Christian. He commented softly to members of the Drollet family: "I'm sorry. ... If I could trade places with Dag, I would. I'm prepared for the consequences."   Afterward, Drollet's father said he thought Marlon Brando was acting and his son was "getting away with murder."   The tragedy was compounded in 1995, when Cheyenne, said to still be depressed over Drollet's death, committed suicide. She was 25.   Details about funeral plans weren't disclosed and Seeley said arrangements would be private.

      Dear Readers,  The past couple of days has been extremely uncomfortable for me due to illness, so, therefore, there have been no updates for The News.  I know - shame on me.  Still, when all you can do is barely raise your head off the pillow or prop your eyelids open with toothpicks, writing is a bit ... um ... difficult to say the very least.  The nasty bug has finally deemed fit to leave my system, so now things slowly return to normal with a posting for today and a short story ready for print tomorrow.  As always, I'm looking for some good stories to print and help give someone a by-line.  In saying this, I NEED MORE STORIES PEOPLE!   Ok, that is out of my system.  You may now return to your normal reading schedule.

       5. On Form   The forms of things differ in a myriad ways, For them there is no common measure. Jumbled and jostled in a ceaseless flux, Living shapes to all their imitations bid defiance.  Words, each with inherent limitations, do only partial service. Meaning harmonizes and integrates them.  The poet's mind toils between substance and the void. Every detail in high and low relief he seeks to perfect, so that the form, although it may transcend the dictates of compasses and ruler, shall be the paragon of resemblance to all shapes and features imitated.  To ravish the eye, rich ornaments may be prized, so that it appears to the heart as true.  Words may in time be exhausted, but not so that their sense is buried. A far-reaching thought attains its object only in the realm of the infinite.  The lyric, born of pure emotion, is gossamer fiber woven into the finest fabric;  The exhibitory essay, being true to the objects, is vividness incarnate;  In monumental inscriptions rhetoric must be a fail to facts;  The elegy tenderly spins out ceaseless heartfelt grief.  The mnemonic is a smooth flow of genial phrases, succinct but pregnant;  The staccato cadences of the epigram are all transparent force.  While the eulogy enjoys the full abandon of grand style,  The expository must in exactitude and clarity excel.  The memorial, balanced and lucid, must be worthy of the dignity of its royal audience,  Rhetoric with glowing words and cunning parables persuades.  These classifications are meticulous, Lost passion and thought, given free rein, may wantonly go astray. The maxim: Let truth be expressed is the most appropriate terms, while of verbage beware.    I think this section has impacted me greatly in my own writing and what I try to achieve.

      It isn't often I  don't  mention one of my animals.  Whether it is in my private journal, on-line journal (sorry, you guys don't have the link for that yet) or when I am talking with my friends.  My dogs and cat are very important creatures to me.  They are my friends, companions, and give me great joy.  In an odd sense, they are indeed like my children.  JoJo is the youngest of my children, though good sized all in all.  She tries her best to do what I want her to do  with LOTS of enthusiasm.   She tries to help me get up, sit down, and to bring me toys to play with.  JoJo isn't my favorite, I try not to have favorites (and am doing a pretty good job), but there is something very special about Jo.   She doesn't just love me, think I'm the coolest thing to ever walk, but she  adores  me.  She doesn't just look on me with love, but with adoration and it is a humbling thing.  Why humbling?  Because seeing an animal, much less a person, look on you with so much trust and love makes you really take stock of who and what you are as a person.  For me, it encourages me to keep that adoration and trust.  God put JoJo in my life for a reason.  Sometimes I think it was to teach me how to be a better, more loving person, because that is just exactly what I've become.  So, here is a picture of my darling JoJo.     (She just HAD to get up close and personal to see what I was doing.  Cheyenne once said JoJo had more curiosity than a cat.  I'm beginning to think he was very accurate in his assumption.)

       Saturday is my birthday. How old I will be is not important really, just the fact that I'm older than 21 and younger than 45. This is the first birthday I will be having without my parents. This is an odd feeling. It is a lonely feeling to know, accept the two people who made you are no longer living and on this earth with you.      Mommy always used to say, "No one loves you like your mommy and daddy." She was right. No one loves you like your parents, or those who take the place of your parents, whether they be friends or grandparents. No one gives you that all out unconditional love and respect they do. True, not everyone has this relationship with their parents, but I did. I had unconditional love and support and now they aren't here and I feel the poorer for it.      Looking at this birthday looming in the near future I can't help but wonder when people actually become adults. It feels as if I was always playing at being an adult until both my parents were gone. My Dad was in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's, yet he was alive and I always felt he was with me in some fashion. Now, he is gone from this earth, from my current existence and it makes me stumble back in surprise and pain sometimes.       Last birthday, my Mom had just passed and I felt absolutely alone, or so I thought. I am alone now.       Yes, I am married, but his love is conditional. Yes, I have friends, but their love and respect is conditional.       Now I must stand erect, take responsibility for all of my actions and be an adult because there is no one to turn to in that unconditional way. The security I once knew is gone and I am going to have to build upon my marriage and my relationships to see me through the remainder of my life.      Now is the time I make a home, because  no one loves you like your Mommy and Daddy:  They made a home for me, and now I must make a home for myself.

       4. The Joy of Writing   Writing is in itself a joy, Yet saints and sages have long since held it in awe.  For it is being, created from a void; It is sound rung out of profound silence. In a sheet of paper is contained the infinite, And, evolved from an inch-sized heart, an endless panorama.  The words, as they expand, become all-evocative, The thought, still further pursued, will run the deeper.  Till flowers in full blossom exhale all-pervading fragrance, and tender boughs, their saps running, grow in a whole jungle of splendor.  Bright winds spread luminous wings, quick breezes soar from the earth, and clouds arise from the writing brushes.

       The Monster Hunter   By  Eric S. Brown   Copyright 2003 by Eric S. Brown     The thing sat perched on top of the car. The car's roof had caved inward, barely able to support the thing's massive weight as its eyes stared at him with burning hatred and the night's breeze ruffled its brown fur.  Greg could only wonder how things had gotten so out of hand. In all his years at this job, he had never been so wrong about what he was up against. It was supposed to have been a were-creature. That was what all the reports the church had given him had said but this thing before him was much more than that. It was a demon straight from the depths of Hell itself.  Greg had worked for the church for the last seventy years. A lot of things had changed. The realm of mankind continued to grow leaving the supernatural fewer and fewer shadows to hide in and forcing more and more "things" out into the light. It was his job to make sure they were destroyed before the world at large came to find out the truth of their existence. Not all the changes in the world had been bad though. Technology gave him an edge he'd never had before and kept him safe from a natural death. A serum of nano-bots flowed through his veins which both kept him young and healed his wounds at an accelerated rate. It also offered lucky side-effect of increasing the speed of even his highly experienced and skilled reflexes by a factor of ten.  The thing snarled at him showing rows upon rows of sickeningly yellow teeth. There was no one on the street in either direction but him and it. The small town of Canton was long asleep. He stood at the top of the steps leading into the hotel where he had tracked the demon to before it had turned the tables on him and watched it as he thought out his next move. He hated the fact that it had found him instead of the other way around. Then in a blur, he made his move. He dove off the steps, twin Desert Eagles appearing in his hands. His first three shots struck the creature knocking it backwards off the car as his fourth tore into the vehicle's gas tank. The falling creature was engulfed as the car blossomed into a fireball, lighting up the night and sending shrapnel flying everywhere. Greg hit the pavement of the lot rolling and leapt to his feet untouched by the debris.  Lights were flickering on in the hotel and buildings surrounding the lot. Greg didn't care though. He let a smile cross his lips. The demon had went down much easier than he had thought. Three blessed silver bullets and one explosion, ha, that was a walk in the park compared to some of the vampires he'd faced. He turned to head back into the hotel and let the desk clerk know what was going. As he did so, two things happened at once. The desk clerk emerged from the hotel shouting and asking if he could help and the creature sprang at Greg from where it now clung to the hotel's wall above the entrance. Somehow, it had gotten behind him and was far from dead.  It moved faster than the normal human eye could follow and only Greg's heightened senses allowed him to perceive it all. He tried to side step its attack but wasn't fast enough. It plowed into him and they toppled back out into the parking lot a mass of sprawling limbs. The clerk saw the thing and screamed, darting back inside and slamming the door behind him.  Greg took the full force of the landing as the creature managed to stay on top. He felt bones snap like wooden twigs inside his chest. He fought the pain and jerked his head to the left just as the creature's claws sunk deep in the concrete scraping his ear. Greg emptied the remaining clips of both Eagles into its belly from below it while kicking out and up with all his strength. The demon howled as it was knocked off him.  Greg dropped the empty guns and tried to crawl away from the thing, watching as its wounds closed. He could feel his own body trying to repair the damage done to it but the creature healed almost instantly. He dug into the lining of his trenchcoat and produced a golden dagger. It was his last and only hope. The dagger was no ordinary blade. It had fallen into his care decades ago. It blade absorbed magical into itself and dispelled it into nothingness. Greg just hoped it was strong enough.  The demon was up already and on the move. It leapt towards him like a great cat, arms spread wide and claws shining in the pale glow of the fire and the street lights. Greg threw the blade. It spun end over end through the air lodging itself into the thing's throat. The world around Greg went white as a being of pure magic met the magical null field of the blade. The demon cried out and vanished into the metal of the blade.  As the glowing dagger clattered to pavement, Greg rolled to get a better view of the blade. He said a quick prayer to thanks to the maker for letting his desperate plan work and then collapsed to the ground once more. He heard sirens blaring in the distance as he wondered if he was really getting too old for this kind of work serum or not. Then he laughed. He knew he would never give up the game.

       Actress Fay Wray of `King Kong' Fame Dies   1 hour, 3 minutes ago  By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer  NEW YORK - Fay Wray, who won everlasting fame as the damsel held atop the Empire State Building by the giant ape in the 1933 film classic "King Kong," has died, a close friend said Monday. She was 96.   AP Photo   Reuters Slideshow: Actress Fay Wray Dies at 96     Wray died Sunday at her Manhattan apartment, said Rick McKay, a friend and director of the last film she appeared in. There was no official cause of death.   "She just kind of drifted off quietly as if she was going to sleep," said McKay, director of the documentary "Broadway: The Golden Age."   "She just kind of gave out."   During a career that started in 1923, Wray appeared with such stars as Ronald Colman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy, but she was destined to be linked with the rampaging Kong in movie fans' minds.   "I used to resent `King Kong,'" she remarked in a 1963 interview. "But now I don't fight it anymore. I realize that it is a classic, and I am pleased to be associated with it. Why, only recently an entire issue of a French magazine was devoted to discussing the picture from its artistic, moral and even religious aspects."   She wrote in her 1988 autobiography, "On the Other Hand": "Each time I arrive in New York and see the skyline and the exquisite beauty of the Empire State Building, my heart beats a little faster. I like that feeling. I really like it!"   "King Kong" obscured the other notable films Wray made during the '30s. They included adventures "The Four Feathers" (with Richard Arlen and William Powell) and "Viva Villa" (Wallace Beery), Westerns "The Texan" (Cooper) and "The Conquering Horde" (Arlen), romances "One Sunday Afternoon" (Cooper) and "The Unholy Garden" (Colman) as well as horror films "Dr. X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum."   After appearing in Erich von Stroheim's 1928 silent "The Wedding March," playing a poor Viennese girl abandoned by her lover, a playboy prince, Wray became a much-employed leading lady. In 1933, the year of "King Kong," she appeared in 11 films, co-starring with Beery, George Raft, Cooper, Jack Holt and others.   In 1980, she told of her dissatisfaction with roles of that period: "In those days, the female characters never knew who their parents were. Leading ladies were not supposed to be funny but were supposed to stand there and look beautiful. That was frustrating as an actress."   In her autobiography, the actress recalled that she had been paid $10,000 for "King Kong" (budget: $680,000), but her 10 weeks' work was stretched over a 10-month period. "Residuals were not even considered, because there were no established unions to protect us," she added.   In "King Kong," she plays an unemployed actress who agrees to take a job with a movie company that is going on location to a mysterious island. Kong is the huge ape that inhabits a part of the island.   When the film company discovers him, Kong is attracted to Wray and abducts her. But he is eventually captured and brought to New York and put on display. Kong escapes and finds Wray, with terrifying results, but eventually meets his death on the Empire State Building.   She was proud that "King Kong" had saved RKO studio from bankruptcy. Of Kong she wrote: "He is a very real and individual entity. He has a personality, a character that has been compelling to many different people for many different reasons and viewpoints."   She was the guest of honor in 1991 at a ceremony marking the 60th birthday of the Empire State Building, saying that if she were mayor of New York, "I would want to run the city from this building ... and get up every morning to see the sun rise."   Although Kong appeared huge, the full figure was really only 18 inches tall. Miss Wray knew him by the arm, which was 8 feet long.   "I would stand on the floor," she recalled, "and they would bring this arm down and cinch it around my waist, then pull me up in the air. Every time I moved, one of the fingers would loosen, so it would look like I was trying to get away. Actually, I was trying not to slip through his hand."      By the late '30s, the actress was appearing in low-budget films, and she quit working in 1942 to be a wife and mother. Her first husband was John Monk Saunders, who wrote such air films as "Wings" and "The Dawn Patrol." She was 19 and he was 30 when they married. She discovered he was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and the marriage became a nightmare.  After a divorce, she married Robert Riskin, the brilliant writer of "It Happened One Night," "Lost Horizon" and other Frank Capra films. In 1950, he suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. He died five years later.  Returning to work in 1953, Wray appeared mostly in motherly roles in youth-oriented films like "Small Town Girl," "Tammy and the Bachelor" and "Summer Love." In 1979 she played opposite Henry Fonda (news) in a TV drama, "Gideon's Trumpet."  She was born Vina Fay Wray on Sept. 15, 1907, near Cardston in rural Alberta, Canada. Her parents moved to the United States when she was 3, first trying farming in Arizona, and eventually returning to Salt Lake City, where Wray's mother was from. Later, they settled in Los Angeles.  As a teenager she haunted studio casting offices and won an occasional bit role. Despite her mother's fears that the movie crowd was sinful, Miss Wray was allowed to accept a six-month contract with Hal Roach at $60 a week.  Wray had a daughter, Susan, from her first marriage and a daughter and son, Victoria and Robert Jr., by the second. Sixteen years after Riskin's death, she married his physician, Dr. Sandford Rothenberg.  ___  Associated Press writer Bob Thomas in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

      Eric S. Brown is the author of the paperback collections  Dying Days ,  Space Stations and Gravey ards, and  Portals of Terror  as well as the chapbooks  Flashes of Death ,  Zombies the War Stories ,  Bad Mojo , and  Dark Karma  and the e-books  Blood Rain ,  Quantum Nightmares , and  Poisoned Graves . His short fiction has been published well over two hundred and fifty times in a wide array of markets like  The Book of Dark Wisdom ,  Nocturnal Ooze  and  Alien Skin  magazines,  The Edge ,  Story House Coffee ,  Post Mortem , and  Black Petals  among many, many others. He is 29 years old and lives in NC with his wife Shanna. His first novel, Cobble (co-authored by Susanne Brydenbaugh), is due out in early 2005 from Cyberpulp Books.  Last week I had the wonderful opportunity interviewing Mr. Brown and discovered a writer filled with wit, good humor, and a love of writing.  I hope you enjoy what he has to say.    Eric : Good Morning  hah : Good morning, so nice to meet you.  Eric : Nice to meet you too.   Eric : I will confess I have never done an IM interview before.  Did a live phone call for a radio show once but most editors who run print magazines often just send a questionnaire to fill out.   HAH : I understand.  This is my first interview via IM as well.  hah: So, why don't you tell me a little about yourself first?  You're married.  Any kids?  Eric : I started in March of 2001 one.  My wife finally kicked my butt to do it and sent out a tale to Burning Sky mag. and Black Petals mag. both of which I had found in the novel and short writers' digest and BOTH of them accepted it within two weeks.  Had to turn down one of the contracts and but the story came out in print that June and I have been at it ever since.  My first year, I made $15 and copies.  Last year, I made a little more and ton of copies.  I STILL am not making enough to just live on.  hah : Wow, that is absolutely awesome!  hah : Still, you are on your way.  Eric : I am 29, live in NC, my wife is a special ed. teacher, I have no kids, have a three year old Maine Coon named Howard after H.P. Lovecraft (the great horror author, 1890-1937), avid zombie movie fan and comic book collector (mainly the Fantastic Four from Marvel)  hah : No Spidey?  Eric : I like Spidey but the FF has a much more SF feel to it and I love the family dynamic of the book.   Eric : Now my wife LOVED Toby M. as Spidey.  It sold her on the movies  hah : LOL, I loved the movies.  My husband and best friend are WebHeads.  Eric : COOL.  Glad to know Marvel has other fans out there  hah : Yes, they do.  hah : So, how long have you been writing all together?  Published and non-published?  Eric : Since March 2001 I have been submitting but I have been writing since the 2nd grade.   hah : 2nd grade?  That's marvelous, how old were you when you can remember your first story?  Do you remember what prompted you to start writing?  Eric : I was about 7 and it was about a serial killer who couldn't die.  Kind of like the Halloween movies.  I was always an odd kid.  I took an issue of Fangoria to Kindergarten with me the first day.  hah : Fangoria?  Your parents let you have it so young?  Eric : They say it takes most writers ten years to hit the published side.  I just got lucky.  hah :I'm glad you did.  Eric : I was "gifted" according to my teachers and I even had a tutor prior to kindergarten so I was reading on a very advanced level and when other kids were buying toys, I was visiting the comic shop and Fango was there too.  My parents didn't care as long as I was reading and getting such praise from my teachers.  Though the teachers often had talks with my parents about the material.  Didn't stop me though.  LOL.  hah : What do you think influenced you to write?  Do you believe you were born to do it?   Eric : I believe I was born to write BUT it was seeing Night of the Living Dead that hooked me.  After watching it and Dawn of the Dead I was so in love with Romero's work I had to do something so I started cranking out my own zombie tales.  Eric : For instance, http://www.nakedsnakepress.com/ Check out my chapbook on this page.  Eric : These days I almost feel like I am trying to create a sub-genre within horror.  Kind of a military horror fiction.  Eric : I read a lot of David Drake's SF military stuff so I guess that rubbed off on me even though I am a horror writer.  hah : What other writers have influenced you in thought, perhaps writing desire, but not in style?  Eric : H.P. Lovecraft of course, I think any horror writer would name him.  Dan Simmons, Philip K. Dick, John Bryne, and too many others too list.   hah : So, what else do you do?  Eric : I am a photo tech.  I develop, enhance photos, etc. in a lab.  It's a part time gig that helps make ends meet.  I used to work for a newspaper but got burnt out being told what to write and fixing other peoples mistakes -- a copy-editor.  hah : Ahhh, I see.  Is your job as challenging and creative as it would seem to be, or boring?  Eric : BORING  Eric : Trust me on that one.  hah : I believe you, LOL.  Eric : The goal is to write full time and I am hoping that my first novel (due out next year) will be the next big step towards that goal.  hah : Would you mind telling me a little bit about your writing process?  Do you use computer only?  Pen and paper for first draft?  Carry around a notebook with you for those quick ideas...etc?  Eric : Pen and paper first.  ALWAYS.  I then rewrite and edit on the computer as I type the tale.  I carry around two notebooks actually.  One for my tales and one full of records, release dates, when I get the rights back to certain tales, and all that kind of junk plus a pub history.  hah : Can you tell me a little bit about the novel, without too many spoilers?  Eric : Well, it's a zombie book that isn't a zombie book.  There's a "zombie" virus that wipes out the world but one little island named Cobble (also the book's title) remains pretty much untouched thanks to the efforts of the local sheriff.  So it's really the last place left in the world where people live any kind of normal life  Eric : Then one day a group of rogue military personel show up and stake a claim to the island in the name of a now defunct government.  Eric : Anyway as the islanders and the soldiers try to cope and co-exist, murders begin to happen on the island as the demon who created the plague shows up to finish wiping out the human race as Cobble is all that's left.  Eric : There's a soldier who is a lot more than he seems too, and has strange dreams that go back to the beginning of time and he is the good guy however the sherifff is the main character. hah: How long did it take you to write the novel?  Eric : It should be noted that Susanne Brydenbaugh co-wrote the novel with me based on a screenplay I had written when I was younger.   Eric : It took eight months and we had to go through e-mail alone as she lives in Alabama  hah : Susanne Brydenbaugh - can you tell me a little of her writing, publishing history?  Eric : www.mywriterstooth.com is her website.  She has published around 70 stories I would guess including ones in pro markets like Would That It Were but I don't think she had ever sold a book before our project together.  Eric : For me, Cobble was my first novel but far from my first book.  I had sold 3 paperback collections and six chapbooks prior to it as well as 2 e-books, and I have since just this month sold yet another e-book.  hah : Wonderful.  Eric : Yep, 4 paperbacks, 6 chapbooks, and 3 e-books since 2003 so things seem to be taking off and I am breaking out of JUST short fiction.  hah : May I ask you about your co-writing process?   Eric : Well I collaborate a LOT.  Blood Rain (one of my e-books, done with Gail Davis) was just like Cobble.  We trade sections or chapters and then rewrote things until we were happy.  I have sold at least 19 collaborated short stories as well, not counting reprints.  I think writing with others helps one grow and experience different ways to write.  Eric : I have never written with some who was actually close enough to write with in person.  In fact, I am my county's ONLY working horror author that I know.  hah : What do you think is the most challenging aspect of writing?  Eric : The most challenging thing I am facing at the moment is coming up with ideas post my first NOVEL.  The novel took a lot out of me and I have published so much in the last three years it's hard to stay fresh and not rehash stuff I have done before.  Eric : http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_site=citizen-times&f_site=citizen-times&amp;f_sitename=Asheville+Citizen-Times+%28NC%29&p_theme=gannett&amp;p_action=search&p_field_base-0=&amp;p_text_base-0=Horror+author+Eric+Brown&Search=Search&amp;p_perpage=10&p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_queryname=700&s_search_type=keyword&amp;p_product=ACTB&p_sort=_rank_%3AD&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date%3AB%2CE&amp;p_text_date-0=-  Eric : That mess is the link I was hunting  Eric : I was going to say, being the only local horror author isn't bad.  In fact it gets me into the papers a lot.  That was a front page article with a photo.  Eric : I have been on the front page of two locals papers in the last year and had numerous articles about me including reviews of my work and was even on the local TV network of ABC last Oct.  Eric : So being unique=press  Eric : At least in rural NC  hah : That can be quite useful.  hah : How do you keep your writing fresh for yourself and for your readers so far?  Eric : That is a tough and excellent question, I am not sure I have a real answer.  I just keep trying to come up with stuff (certainly in the zombie sub-genre) that people haven't seen before.  How I do it, I have no idea.  hah : Zombies - what is the allure of them?  :-)  Eric : I like the end of the world.  It's concept that has always intrigued me.  Given the moral decline and to a degree even cultural stagnation of our society, zombies seem to be the best metaphor to express where we are headed.  And not just that, when you think of all the viruses and the advanced science out there today, a zombie virus isn't ALL that unbelievable.   hah : Do you think you express a lot of ideas people are too afraid to voice out loud in your writing?  Eric : I'd like to think so and in looking back at my work you can see a running theme of "if we don't change, we're headed for the end" but honestly, I think of my work as art.  It's just something I love to do and don't go out of my way to put those messages in there, they just happen.  Eric : I have addressed everything from genetic engineering to sociological collapse in my stories and even aliens and solar flares.  hah : You said you thought of your work as art, can you elaborate on that for a moment?  I have never thought of zombies as "art" before.  Eric : I did?  That was a typo, I meant I totally don't think of it as art.  It's just fun for me and if it does express a message too that's great.  Eric : SORRY  hah : LOL, ok.  hah : So, in the philosophical sense, writing is your truest "work" while your employment is your job?  Eric : In 2002 I had one of my tales recommended in the Bram Stoker awards and had a tale be a top ten finalist nationally for best short horror 2002 and last year I got TWO Stoker recs for best collection 2003 and was mentioned in the 17th annual Year's Best Horror and Fantasy  Eric : Exactly, writing is my work and my life and anything else is just a day job. I hope to be remembered for my writing one day, but that's kind of arrogant and I don't really expect it to happen.   hah : I don't believe that is arrogant at all.  Each of us wants to be remembered for something, especially something we love.  It gives us hope, I believe, whether or not we have children following after.  hah : Where do you find places to submit your work?  Do you use www.writersmarket.com?  www.ralan.com ... etc.?  Eric : www.ralan.com!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's totally the best.  However I also use the SpecficMe newsletter and sometimes even still use the old digest book that comes out yearly  hah : What is SpecificMe?  Eric :  http://www.specficworld.com/ It's a newletter of market listings from this site.  I got a free subscription with my check when I sold them an article at the start of this year.  Eric : They're pretty good and sometimes have stuff that ralan.com doesn't  hah : It is almost 10am and I have to go soon.  So just a couple more questions if I may?  Eric : Shoot  hah : If you could give fledgling writers any advice to encourage them, what would it be?  What technical advice would you give?    Eric : Also, in case you want it, here is a link to Dying Days you can use with the article if you like http://www.silverlakepublishing.com/catalog/ddays.html  Eric : WRITE, and then write some more.  Try to write everyday even if you junk it.  Always keep writing but just as importantly, submit your work.  You'll never get published if you don't submit.  Editors won't seek you out, it doesn't work that way, you have to go to them.  Eric : And listen to their advice but take it with a grain of salt too. Just never give up.

      Life is nothing but change.  Sometimes the changes are good.  Sometimes they are bad.  Most of the time you never know whether or not they are good or bad until after the change has happened.  Then you either try and change again to correct a problem, or endeavor to continue the changing process until you are a better person.

      Yesterday, hubby and I went for a walk around our neighborhood and into Lexington proper. Although we have lived here for nigh on six years, this was the first walk we had taken.  As we strolled down the street we met a neighbor who lives straight across from us and has been there for six months. We hadn't met him until yesterday. On down the way we met another neighbor, this time a woman who was busy painting the house for her son and his new bride. They will be moving in some time this week. It was amazing how friendly she was.  Hubby and I talked of little mundane matters of our daily lives as we walked. We laughed and saw many interesting houses we hadn't even notice, even though we drive by them each and every day, sometimes several times a day. Still, as we walked and saw them, everything was so beautiful and people would say hello to us as we passed, usually. I was surprised at how friendly they were.  It became more and more evident as we walked and talked, that getting to know the neighborhood was far easier when you walked than when you drove. People's faces didn't look on you with suspicion in their faces, but usually a smile.  Long ago, back in the hills, I remember when people would walk to a neighbor's house to talk and stop along the way. We could see them coming and my Mom would put on a pot of coffee or start making lemonade or something for them to drink. We always had something set aside in the refrigerator for company, even if it was leftovers.  Although we cannot invite people into our home for safety reasons in today's day and age, I think I am going to return to that "cooking a little extra" just in case a friend drops by or someone passes on the street and stops by the porch for a moment.  Hospitality and good manners can easily be shared, just as the people yesterday quietly shared a piece of their lives with us. We can be careful, and we can also reach out to people in quiet loving ways.

       To obtain choice ideas in close observation of things in categories, and elect expressions that will fall in happy order,      All objects visible under the sun or moon will the poet bring into the light, all that can give out a sound hewill ring to test their resonance.      He makes barren twigs put forth luxuriant foliage as they sway, or by endless waves he traces to the remote fountainhead.      He may either work from the obscure to the obvious,   Or follow an easy course to what is hard to obtain.      By illuminating a tiger, the shapes of tame animals are illuminated, or frightens the surf-tossed guss with the vision of a dragon.      Sometimes with sure touches and smooth rhythm his ideas in utmost ease flow on. At other moments, they are beset my mountainous obstacles.      But not until the heart attains calm transparency does thought crystallise into such words as no man before fancied or pronounced.      Then, both heaven and earth find new embodiment in the shape desired, and all things become visible under the tip of his brush, which after parching anxiety and hesitations is saturated and sweeps forth in a moist wave.      When the substance of a composition, trunk of a tree, is by truth sustained, style aids it to branch into leafy boughs and bear fruit.      Indeed, feeling and expression should never fail to correspond, as each emotional change wears a new complexion on a sensitive face.      Thought that swells with joy bursts into laughter;   When grief is spoken, words reverberate with endless sighs,   No matter if the work be accomplished in one flash on the page, or is the result of the most deliberate brush.

       1 . The Motive     Standing erect in the center of all, the poet views the expanse of the whole universe, and in ancient masterpieces his spirit rejoices and finds nurture.      His lament for the fleeting life is in observance of the four seasons as they pass, his regard for the myriad growing things inspires in him thoughts innumerable.      As with the fallen leaves in autumn's rigor his heart sinks in grief, so is each tender twin in sweet spring a source of joy.      In frost he finds sympathy at moments when his heart is all frigid purity, or far, far in to the highest clouds he makes his mind's abode.      The shining, magnamimous deeds of the world's most virtuous are substance of his song, as also the pure fragrance which the most accomplished goodness of the past yields. The flowering forest of letters and treasuries of classics are his favorite haunts, where he delights in nothing less than perfection of beauty's form and matter.      Thus moved, he will spread his paper and poise his brush   To express what he can in writing.          2. Meditation Before Writing       In the beginning,   All external vision and sound are suspended,   Perpetual thought itself gropes in time and space;      Then, the spirit at full gallop reaches the eight limits of the cosmos, and the mind self-buoyant, will ever soar to new insurmountable heights.      When the search succeeds, feeling, at first but a glimmer, will gradually gather into full luminosity, when all objects thus lit up glow as if each the other's light reflects.      Drip-drops are distilled afresh from a sea of words since time out of mind, as quintessence that savors of all the aroma of the Six Arts.      Now one feels blithe as a swimmer calmly borne by celestial waters, and then, as a diver into a secret world, lost in subterranean currents.      Arduously sought expressions, hitherto evasive, hidden, will be like stray fishes out of the ocean bottom to emerge on the angler's hook;      And quick winged metaphors like birds are brought down from the curl-clouds by the fowler's bow.      Thus the poet will have mustered what for a hundred generations awaited his brush, creating music that has waited unheard for a thousand ages.      Let the full-blown garden flowers of the ancients in their own morning glory stand; to breathe like into late blossoms that have yet to bud will be his sole endeavor.      Eternity he sees in a twinkling,   And the whole world he views in one glance.

       Remember the old saying  What does not kill us, makes us stronger ? I am having one of those days where I feel as if I have received, and possibly given one of those fatal strokes. It has gotten me to thinking a lot about life and loving and living.      In my life there has only been one constant for eleven years, hubby. He has been the most precious thing to me. My Hubby is the most wonderful man I have ever known, or ever loved and his centeredness in my life is remarkable.      Balancing everything else around him is easy, or, at least I thought so until today. Choosing between many different things and him, I am always going to choose him. This is the part where I thought about "living" and all of its connotations today.      You see, living, loving, and just plain  being  is difficult. No matter where you turn you run into obstacles, walls, pits dug for you to fall into and impale yourself upon sharpened bamboo spikes, maybe even a tiger or two. Keeping your life running smoothly is hard work, and no matter how hard you work at it, there are always going to be days like today when everything seems to fall apart.      In the midst of the "falling apart" feeling, has been a steady thrum of "Everything is going to be okay." Yes, it is my usual mantra, but today it was coming from outside myself. It was, is as if God is telling me that directly. "Everything is going to be ok." No matter how bad things have been feeling today, that has been a constant in my deepest heart.       It isn't that pretentious feeling you have when you think everything is going to be ok and want it to be so bad you practically convince yourself of it. It is a real and genuine feeling everything is going to be all right.       This is the first time I have ever felt this feeling and it be genuine.       I've told myself my cat was going to be ok and he died, and I knew he was going to die. His life had simply come to its stopping point after 13 years. Still, I worked so hard to make everything BE OK until it was a mess for me emotionally in losing my beloved Friskers.      I am one of those people who has worked nearly their entire lives on making everything be all right, until it has been almost impossible to accept when it isn't. When something happened, a death in the family or a catastrophe, it made me think impossibly dark thoughts. Now, as in today, I am firmly holding on to a faith that is telling me everything is going to be all right and I know it is genuine.      No matter what happens, I will work on this problem, I will pray, and I am giving it fully to God to make right, because that is just what I need to do, never mind it is what I am  supposed  to do.       What does not kill us, makes us stronger.

      I am tired. I have been cleaning in one space or another most of the day. I haven't done anything "creative" except for organizing some things on my white work table here in the computer room. The white table is a catch all for everything that happens to fly in this room, so, I cleaned it off, not because I was tired of looking at its mess and clutter, but because we are expecting company.  I have also made a significant dent in the dishes in the sink and have worked diligently on getting the kitchen table in some semblance of order. I genuinely feel as if I have accomplished much today.  It isn't often I am domestic here in the house. My writing projects take up much of my time, so, today was an excursion into the "other realm" for me. Despite everything I hate about house-work, this was quite enjoyable. Although, I must admit, plans on doing it again "soon" may be somewhat irrationally over-stated.  There was a lag in the cleaning routine today, when it simply seemed impossible to finish much of what has been done. The white table just seemed too much to do in one day, much less a week. So, I turned to the computer, not to plot upon plots, but to find some music in which to listen to.  When the music came on, my heart and body felt rejuvenate. I  knew  the table was going to get cleaned, especially with the music turned up very loud.  Finishing the white table was a snap with music, so my attention's turned to other places I may turn my hand to (and boy did I find them). The music from the computer filled the house. It was today's pop music and then Lenny Kravitz, and now country, being followed by Sean Paul and some wonderful reggae mixes.  Why is that things get done faster, and usually better, when music is playing? I've always said my life had a soundtrack, I just wasn't sure what it was. Still am not. Hopefully the soundtrack of my life (not the things kids fill out in on-line journals and blogs) will be just as interesting as my life currently seems to be.  Even being so tired isn't so bad, as long as good, loud music is playing.

       I have been writing since I was 3 years old. I wrote stories and poems about the things I saw around me, and, as a child, my imagination was very active and ready for almost any possibility.      As I grew up, grew older, writing has always been that magnificient jump of imagination and word play. Painting, if you will, upon a piece of paper with words instead of colors. Now, thanks to hubby, there is a wonderful piece on writing from China, circa A.D. 300 that has come to my attention. It is called "Wen Fu" and is The Art of Writing.      Since it has so impressed me, and since I found an open domain copy of the essay at  urlLink http://www.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/LuChi.htm , I decided to put part of the essay into The News each day - except for Wednesdays and Saturday when The News will be featuring other writers and writings (hopefully).      So, without further adieu, here is Lu Chi's  Wen Fu.       The Art of Writing (circa A.D. 300)       Based on a translation by Shih-Hsiang Chen, 1952, modified after consulting a translation by Sam Hamill, 1991.           Preface           I have often studied the works of talented men of letters and thought to myself that I obtained some insight into their minds at work. The ways of employing words and forming expressions are indeed infinitely varied. But, accordingly, the various degrees of beauty and excellence can be distinguished from what is common and weak. When by composing my own works, I become aware of the ordeal. Constantly present is the feeling of regret that the meaning falls short of the objects observed. The fact is, it is not so hard to know as it is to do.          I am therefore writing this essay on literature to tell of the glorious accomplishments of past men of letters, and to comment on the causes of failure and successs in writing. Perhaps some day the secret of this most intricate art may be entirely mastered. In making an axe handle by butting wood with an axe, the model is indeed near at hand. But the adaptability of the hand to the ever-changing circumstances and impulses in the process of creation is such as words can hardly explain. What follows is only what can be said in words.          (Part II will appear on Thursday)

       Position Filled   By Henrietta Asher Handy   Copyright (c) 2004 by Henrietta Asher Handy     Position filled of hero wanted. No more applicants need apply.  I have found the shoulders to cry on, And the chest where I can hide my face and cry  The arms wrap warm around me, and the smiles smile down, And the encouragement flows despite the insecurity that is me.  I have found the hero’s heart that can love, Even the Me when all else fails, should it ever, there will forever be a WE.  Yet most important of all, he lets me love him, Just as I am with all this heart can possess.  Position filled of hero wanted, no more applicants need apply. It is time to know the love I have found and understand this happiness.       Do not reprint without permission from the author.

        A Stray Thought    By Henrietta Asher Handy Copyright (c) 2004 by Henrietta Asher Handy    Yesterday was the beginning of August. It just popped up on me this year. July moved so quickly. June was non-existant. Life seemed to just JUMP and start running without warning.    Does losing people make Time go faster because you are more aware time is passing, has passed?    I just wonder.
