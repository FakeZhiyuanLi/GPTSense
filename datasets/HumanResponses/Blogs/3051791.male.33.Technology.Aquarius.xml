      I'm filled with self-doubt about that interview yesterday. Damnit, I knew that the three types of firewalls were filtering, stateful inspection, and proxy, I knew that traceroute worked by sending ICMP packets with varying TTLs to get responses from each hop, but I just wasn't getting anything out properly. When he asked me the first question that I didn't know, I think it shook my confidence and I just slid downhill from there. I mean, I held it together, but my answers were clumbsy. It was more like a George Bush speech than a Bill Clinton speech, and I know I was capable of nailing it Clinton style. I guess I'll have to go to this next interview Thursday wearing a flight suit that I have no right to wear and maybe just intimidate my way into the position--worked for Bush, right? Damnit! If I fuck up getting this job because of that performance, I'll need to mete out some serious self-justice.  I finally found the Benni Benassi video for   urlLink Satisfaction  . I must say I'm strangely allured by these scantily clad, sweaty chicks with power tools...  Great article ( Flying Solo ) in last week's MW about being alone in the Big Apple. An entertaining read: "Or there's roof access, the ultimate apartment feature...I don't need a TV if I have roof access. Apparently someone else in my building felt the same way, and they tossed their TV off the roof onto 4th street. After that, our landlord padlocked the door to the roof and I bought a TV." It's not on their site, gotta find a printed copy.

      Holy cow, I just went through the most gruelling technical interview I've ever been subjected to. I'm trying to get this shiny new uber-high-paying job in network security, and I don't remember the hardest exam from college being this bad. I can't even remember how many questions the interviewer asked, but there were two I flat out didn't know, maybe four I didn't give the best answer to, and another two I think might have been wrong. But, I kicked ass on the rest of 'em! I'm mean really kicked ass. I was snapping out answers faster than the drag queens at Zigfields snap up dollars from the dancefloor during the end-of-show free-for-all fist-off. So I'm in the top 5 and scheduled for another in-person interview. Woo hoo!  Andre and I went to Lizard Lounge last night with Dillon and our newfound fag hag Elana--beautiful, wispy-thin Asian girl dressed in a tight red number with stilletto heel boots. Wow, she actually got more looks than Andre did--at a gay club! That's saying something, cause Andre is one of the most beautiful creatures ever created. But, we all looked like stellar Eurotrash, and he even said I was the cutest he's seen me for awhile--and I thought my hair was a disaster. We started out with drinks and Sake at Dragonfly. Despite the fact that I always think Austin Powers is gonna leap out of somewhere in Dragonfly's pure-white 60s interior, I just love those barstools that bounce. Dillon wouldn't give up the philosophical conversation (I love him for it, but sometimes I just wanna be vacuous), so I finally told him I wouldn't respond anymore and we left for Lizard. Still, later on, he waxed philosophical about the four of us on the big red sofa. Elana pretended not to understand (maybe she didn't, the music was pretty loud) and he finally gave up.  The Israeli guy tried first to hit on Elana (don't understand that one), then on me, then on Andre. Andre finally gave him the bad news that I go home with him only, and still he comes back to tell us now that his (not very handsome) friend wants to go home with both of us, and maybe the girl too. What a bunch of whack jobs. By the time I got back from the lav they had split. We left soon after, dropped Elana at Fox and Hound, and Dillon at the Fireplace. I was hung over this morning.

      More fun today courtesy of the DC area mass transit systems. After another annoying commute to work via Metro, including standing room only on the D6 bus, standing room only on the Red Line, and standing room only on the Orange Line from Metro Center to Ballston, I finally arrive at West Falls Church to meet the 425 bus to take me to my office. Mind you this is the same 425 that smashed into the bus terminal two days ago taking out a sign and cracking a window on the shed, not to mention the damage to the "kneeling" bus which from thereafter only knelt on the driver's side.  This morning, I walk sprightly out of the Metro station towards the 425/427 shed, soon joining the small throng of commuters already assembled. Along comes a bus, but the signboard has numerous burnt out lights such that it is unclear whether it is the 425 or the 427. However, I see a fellow commuter carrying a tote bag identical to those distributed by my comany, so I believe this to be the 425. I embark, and once we reach the bus transit station (where I note the unrepaired damage from the incident two days ago) and again leave it, I realize this bus is taking me anywhere but where I need to go. Oh well, I say, this is obviously the 427, so I will wait until it returns to the transit station and get off and wait for the 425. So, I ride around enjoying the spring scenery of Tyson's Corner (which consists of exactly 3 potted trees surrounded by a pavement casing, and about a billion cars) until we return to the transit station. I see another bus at the 425/427 shed and quickly ask for a transfer slip and inquire of the driver if that was indeed the 425, to which he replied in the affirmative.  With my best effort to recall my 800 meter sprint training from my days on the track team, I vault and bound across the parking lot yanking my laptop bag behind me in acrobatic feats that would make OJ Simpson's Hertz Rent-A-Car commercials look lame, only to arrive at the shed as the bus is pulling away. Undaunted, I run alongside banging furiously on the side of the bus, and the annoyed driver finally stops and opens the door a narrow crack for me to enter. I sit roughly down and try to ignore the "who is this idiot" stares of the other passengers. I prepare to ease back and catch my breath when I realise *this* bus is not taking me where I need to go either! I quicly beg of a neary passenger what bus this is and find out it is the 505 to Reston! Christ!  I yank the stop cord, and the driver, quite confused (there is no stop around here for this bus) pulls over at the next bus stop anyway, and without explanation, I disembark. The bus pulls off with its cadre of passengers staring at the moron who has twice now stopped their bus. I take my bearings and realize I am all the way across Tyson's Corner facing a heft walk no matter how you shake it. Fine. I light a cigarette and pound on the crosswalk button. It of course does not work, since pedestrians are not second, not third, but fourth class citizens in Tyson's Corner. Second Class citizenship is reserved for those motorists who drive automobiles with a sticker price of less than $50,000. Third class citizenship is reserved for mass transit commuters. I had just abandoned my right to claim third class citizenship and was now trudging along the dirt path (no sidewalk) that led along the 45 MPH, 4 lane "street" that leads to my workplace as a bona-fide 4th Class citizen. I arrive to work exactly 44 minutes late (I'd have been 10 minutes early if that had been the 425 bus originally). Once again, thanks Metro PD, thanks alot.

      Yeah, so it's been a long time since I've written anything. I didn't get that shiny new uber-high-paying job, even after five--count em, FIVE--interviews. So, I just keep looking and trudging along at the current dead-end job. I've changed departments and finished my yearly review, which is supposed to be leading to a raise, but I'm not holding my breath.   urlLink Andre's car has been booted  by the lovely Metro PD, and mine is in the shop, so transportation options have shifted to the public realm. 90 degree weather and piss-poor air conditioning lead to repugnant experiences tainted with the miasma of hot and sweaty people's BO and their (and my own) irritation at the 150 people crammed into a railcar that holds only 70 people. One and a half hours to make a trip that should only take 30 minutes. Oh, and the redneck-come-to-visit-DC on the Metro yesterday was the icing on the cake. Drunk, and spewing forth (at the full-volume only possible by those whose threshold for throat pain has been nulled by liquor) political bombast (at least it was anti-Bush) to the disentertainment of all those around him (including me and Andre). Christ, it was annoying.  After carrying my 50 pound laptop bag all around the metro system, I was hot, tired, and very sore in my shoulders and neck, but Andre, unsypathetic, just bitched at me and made me angrier. By the time I got home, I began to realize that my heat+hyperthyroid problem was kicking in and I almost passed out. Thank you, Metro PD, thank you...
