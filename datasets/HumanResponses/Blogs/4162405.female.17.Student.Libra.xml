        hey all...just got back from another driving lesson!!! the ppl of dandenong are crazy....they are all like in a mad rush to get everywhere...anyway....im starting to do lots of planning....birthday...Queens presentation...schoolies....VD and the list goes on. Today i had a Physics SAC *groans*.....Newton doesnt just have 3 laws of motion anymore...i invented another one for him today..as per usual i forgot wat the Third law was so i couldnt answer one of the questions...so instead of leaving the space blank, i created a new one that mite try to help wit some sort of explanation....unfortunately i dont think that this "new Law" is going to get me many marks....oh well this SAC is only worth 20 out of 100 for this semesters marks so its not extremely important.      A couple of days ago we started doing this MIPs thingy at school where we looked at all the different Uni courses and stuff for next year.....they recommend that u put down like 8 preferences but at the moment im going to only put 4.....Melbourne Uni- Bachelor of Veterinary Science (ENTER=99.65), Melbourne Uni - Bachelor of Science (ENTER 81)...Monash Uni Clayton - Bachelor of Science (ENTER= 74), Monash Uni Gippsland- Bachelor of Science (ENTER= 72)...and if i dont get into any of them...that basket weaving course could be looking pretty good....i mean- it could open up a whole new world of opportunity (ummm lol i dont think so) The probability of me getting straight into the Vet course is almot like me wining the $10 million lottery-it aint gunna happen lol...neway, ill try to get ito one of the science courses and transfer over later       In other news...I played my usual Wednesday netball last nite- Yet another WIN to Primary....we r kicking ass....equal top on the ladder, down only by a few %....theres another 2-3 games left, so that means that we should be looking pretty good in the finals.    Untill next time.....mwah

        Well today i had my first official driving lesson...i mean i hav bean driving for like since i was 16 but today was my first pro lesson....the teachers name is Rob and hes pretty cool...i was kinda really nervous but after i got used to the car it was all good....we drove around for about 45 mins with no major probs so yeh.....GO ME!!!!      And Guess wat.....we recently had a major 7 period specialist maths SAC....it was applying maths to the real world and the story line was based about me!!!! hehe...it went a little something like this (cant remember exactly but oh well)....Meaghan is an animal lover who is aspiring to be a Vet blah blah...she finds a baby lizard and needs to make a heat box to make it survive blah blah...and then we had to do stuff with the temperatures n things....i was sooooo stressed out about it cause me and my blonde moments, i did some really stupid things and ended up doing 1 question like 3 times cause i kept getting it wrong.... i wasted over 1.5 periods fixing it and i used that much whiteout that the pages were going to shatter if i dropped the book lol...neways....i ended up gettin 38/40.....how good is that...im like so happy :) *dances* hehe      Now its only 40 days till my party!!!! YAY!!!!! and a few more till my bday...      At school sometime next week we are having a "slave Auction"....its where some of our teaches are put up for auction an the highest Yr12 bidder gets "ownership" of them. In the past, teachers hav been made to wear school uniform, male teachers in fairy costumes etc etc.....its a sort of fun payback for all the stress they make us go thru.....and then later in the week...some of the Yr12 students go up for auction and the teachers bid for them......me n my friend are going up as a pair for auction....hmmm should be interesting       Well should go and study for a Chem test tomoz.....here comes another 64%......and its not just me...like the whole class gets that sort of mark, cause the tests arent about the topics we hav been studying...oh well...it doesnt count as part of the study score so who cares.....    I did pretty well today....i didnt forget anything extremely important........i hope ;) lol    TTFN mwah
