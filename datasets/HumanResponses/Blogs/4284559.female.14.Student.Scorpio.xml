        Well, for a Monday, things turned out pretty well!  I mean, I hurt a girl's feelings (Kurtis's friend Cassie), I think Justin is gonna ask me out, and i just wrote a letter to Chasen!  How exciting, huh?  Not really.  I didn't get to go to the fair Saturday because it rained most of the day.  I didn't get to go to the football game Friday because stupid Travus never called me back!  I am so mad at him by the way.  But what do I expect from Travis. I mean, it's him!  Anyhoo . . . I talked to Luke about Chasen and he says to just tell him the truth about how I feel!  Yeah, well, even if I did tell him the truth he wouldn't believe me or take me back!  That would be giving him my time that he doesn't need or want.  Kurits just called to say what's up.  How nice.  I made a buddy profile for my AIM screen name.  It is pretty cool.  I don't know.  I like it whether anyone else does or not.  Well, I am gonna leave for now.  I will probably be back later.  I am talking to Kurtis so I am getting kinda confused.   Hehe.  Talk to yuh later.  PEACE!  Love yuh bye, Crystal

        My life as of right now sucks!  I mean, I broke up with Chasen, Brit and David broke up!  I just don't know what is wrong in the universe to make things go wrong all of a sudden!  I have a new boyfriend (Kurtis), and I am not so sure that I like him that much now, but I am not sure what I should do about it! DOES ANYONE HAVE ADVICE?!?!?  I am still in love with Chasen, even though he has moved on, doesn't want to be friends with me at all, and he won't tell me what/how he feels about anything!  I really just don't know what I should do about anything!  Once again, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE?!?!?  And the school I am at now (Cocke County High School, Home of the Fighting Cocks) is okay I guess.  I mean, I meet a new person everyday!  I like my classes. There are some guys that like me and everything, but I don't know who and who not to like!  It is very hard work to be a girl now days!  Any ladies wanna agree??  Especially if someone thinks you look good.  Well, that is about all for now!  I will keep you posted almost everyday!  Talk to yuh later.  Love yuh bye, Crystal!  ::Kisses::
