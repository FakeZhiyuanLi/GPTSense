      I'm really not very good at this. I'm working for an IT company and keep thinking to myself, the engineers are so slow, I should just get on and learn to write programmes myself, but whoops, can't even manage to make a decent blog yet! Well at least I'm trying. I mean not all girls are scientists, I think I'm actually doing quite well, could even consider myself quite proud. My mum would agree with me at least!  So it's winter again in Paris, I have jeans and a long tshirt on and I wish I had a jumper too. Don't know what happened to the heat wave but I'm certainly not surfing on it. I suppose the good thing is, is that neither am I getting skin cancer from it!  This month is one of those tiring months, I feel really insipred on the inside, but really worn down on the outside. I have a thousand ideas of things to do and make but when I get home, I just fall asleep watching crappy tv.   When I think about things I'm really glad that life is ok. I might be broke all the time, but that's only cos I spend all my money! At least I have the money to spend in the first place. My apartment is nice and cosy, even if it's not mine. And I still have all my bestest friends all around the world, even if they aren't here with me now, I know there somewhere doing some of the things they always hoped they would.   So if I wasn't a fashion designer I'd be a DJ. And if I wasn't a DJ I'd be a photographer. And if I wasn't a photographer then maybe I'd be a scientist or programmer or a dancer or or a singer or maybe I'd just be housewife married to a rich man, then I could do anything and evreything I wanted, cos then I'd have all the time in the world. I would even do the house work cos my servants would do it. But would I be as happy as I am know. I doubt it. I'd probably be bored shitless! At least now when I fall asleep on the sofa it makes a change. I have loads of things to do, and I couldn't be bored if I tried, but I still gettired, and that's whats annoying me right now. I'm tired of being tired! So when you find the cure, just let me know, cos they don't sell red bull so basically I'm stuffed................

      This is really lame for a first attempt I know. But I only just found out how to log and am Msnning at the same time, and should also be going home as it's too late to be at the office.  Paris, is beautiful, but it's a pain in the arse. Full of french people who take pride in irritating me. The sun is shining but I'm wearing too many clothes. Just got a sewing machine from a friend so will start making some summer creations. There's jut no point going shopping here any more. I can seem to find anything I can afford. All the cheap shops are getting too expensive or really bad quality. And the good stuff, well it's still just too expensive. So I'll go back to doing what I do best, making my own.  Working working, it all becomes so monotonous, and is it all in vain. I don't think I know. And even if I do I don't want to answer that question.

      So I've been a little slack again at updating the old info, but when I have to travel, sometimes it's like going back in time, cos I don't get to have an internet connection. So in between times I've been to London, French countryside, and Slovenian countryside (the whole country is countryside, but you didn't know that!) So most recently I've been teaching poeple how to use the programme in Slovenia, we even translated it. But it's funny you know how come I can go there to a town of 25,000 people and they are all high tech and have money to do stuff. I mean if I go back to my home town, there are still people hanging around and eating dirt, I mean it's not like the stone ages or anything, maybr more like the middle ages, but it just seems that nothing moves on. Ok so that's why I don't live there any more, but it would be nice to see some improvements anyway.  Now Paris is in full summer. At work I have air con and that's great, but at home I don't even have ventilation, which reminds me I was supposed to go buy a fan tonight....doh another sweaty night!!  I don't know today I'm slow on the uptake again. You know it's hard speaking well in English when I speak French all day. That's why I'm using this like my practise ground!
