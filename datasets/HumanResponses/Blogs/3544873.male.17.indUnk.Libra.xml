      Ah, been some time hasn't it. Well, today I got back ''the car.'' WOOOHOOO! It has yet to get tags and all that, but [i]the summer of freedom[/i]!  Friday and Saturday into Sunday was a good time for me.  Friday. Friday was Jon's graduation, and how much he loved it. During the graduation my mother had called me to tell me that she kicked the grandmum out, but nothing was going to hinder my day or Jon's. After the commencement I had the pleasure of meeting The Parents he so often talks (complains) about. Nice people though. Jon's mother was so excited to meet me I had feared for her health. She invited me out to dinner with the family to celebrate, I had no choice.  The dinner was nice, Longhorn. Little did they know that I need to drop 40 pounds, but nice none the less. Many different discussions around the table, not many I involved my self in. Jon seemed to have zoned out a bit too. I knew it was getting close to the departure when Jon pulled out his camera. Then the family said "You have a party to go to! Go on, get out of here!" Jon does know how to work his family.  We did indeed have a 'party' to go to, the Wallaces. We dropped by while the numbers had still been few. Over the hours, many more people came breaking the big group into smaller exclusive groups, exclusive to me and somewhat Jon. We knew the time had come. So Jon walked out the door with a perfect 'tude: "Don't try to include or exclude me from your pathetic lives any more!" And with that he walked out on 13 years of CCS. I somewhat wonder if he is just putting  on a strong facade.  Anyhow, I thought it propper to congratulate Jon in the best way I knew how. He took me back to my place, deserted of the grandmother. We went into my messy abode, or at least I did, with pure intentions. He came in and made himself comfortable on the bed in a somewhat seductive way. I soon made way next to him. We talked for just a little bit then I thought I should make a move. I said "You look like you are a bit excited," asked if he noticed I was too. I started touching his stomache, chest. Then I said "You know, I still haven't seen you naked?" He got undressed somewhat quickly as did I. I gave him head. The first time he was so excited that he couldnt stop his quivering so I stopped to hold him. We went again. He liked it, a lot. I wanted him to spend the night, but he declined a few times. Oh well, I guess just next time I will have to offer a little more. He went  away and I went to sleep, nothing new.  Saturday and thus far Sunday hold no events, but I hope Jon and I will go out tonight, I need to talk to him about something to do with my mother and I. Even without the sex, I want to see him.

      Since Monday, without me realizing it so much, my life has revolved around romantics/sex. I guess this is what happens when you are 17 and you come out of a long term relationship, you are having fun with your newly-reborn sexual freedom.   Some interesting things that have ahppened to me since the last update. After I had just posted to the blog, I wanted to post again because shortly after Jon sent me his Journal Archive, going back to his days of logging on a Mac Classic. Some interesting things came out of it, I liked reading them a lot.   I found the only entry of my journal that still is on my hard drive and compared it to Jon's. He was talking about how he had hinted that if I want him all I have to do is come on to him, and I was talking about how much I want him and a plan on getting him to have fun with me. I had invited him to a movie; in my journal the movie, I thought, might lead to sex. In his journal, he said he wanted to go, but because it might end up in sex, he needed an extra weekend to gather the balls to do it. Hehe...  I am going to go to get a hair cut today. I get to go to Jon's graduation. I do feel honored that he asked me to come and even sai he would provide me with a ride there.   So yes, the last day at Wokini. A short awards thing, a cookout if I want to stay past 10:15 (I don't) and then that is it, no more. I am looking forward to this summer as it will be the summer of adventure. I am going to get a job, have some money, and try to find myself in as many odd situations as possible. Something I just haven't done before. This is my summer of freedom and nothing will stop it.

      Well, after the morning update based on the yesterday events, I figured it was about time I get back on track by doing a night update everynight and not the morning one, I'll see how it works.  Today was a dull day, nothing all too good. I slept in until 11:00ish, woke up, smoked 10 cigs back to back while updating my blog, then got the day rolling. More laundy, cleaning, et cetera. I put a phone line into my room, not bad.  In the middle of my day Chris, the ex-boyfriend called me. He had called Monday too. It seems to be that him and Ken (a boyfriend to him, or ex) are broken up but still living together in the same place as a lesbian, Amanda. So Chris still likes me, I'm not sure of my feelings to him, I somewhat like Ken, Amanda might be moving out, and I might end up moving in a month or so from now. I don't know if I want to because I know all the shit that could happen, and will happen, but I have no place else to go when my mother starts to rent the house out in July, a month from now.  I want a boyfriend right now. I don't feel too good about my general body, and I don't feel to keen on anyone else tonight. I sometimes feel like the world is here to do nothing more than to tease me with things I can't have. I need to find a boyfriend. Maybe I will go to CYG once or so, but I would feel guilty going there to seduce a mate. Still, a boy has got to do what a boy has got to do, and I need a boy to do.

      Yesterday was somewhat an odd day, but a good day none the less. A day that would be nice as a weekly routine sort of day.  I woke up and got to cleaning and reinhabiting my room. I moved a table into the room to make way for my several computers. I still am wotking on everything.  At aroud 6:30ish Jon came to pick me up. We went to this little youth group thing that I had no idea why I went, my teeth chattering all the while. This youth group thing seemed to be more like a get together of people who know eachother, I only knew the two people I came in with. Jon seemed to have a good time, as did ray. We went to B&N after so that was pretty cool. I got interested in "I Talk Pretty One Day," "Naked," and "This Book will Change Your Life."  We went to the Rave after and met up with Ben and Amanda to see "The Day After Tomorrow." If I had payed I would say 'what a big flipping waste of money,' but I guess it was okay with the MST3Kesque comments made by our group. Jon payed for my ticket. I need a job, I hate to mooch, it feels so wrong.  We Jon, Ray, and I piled into his car to move the party to the local S&S, where this guy from Wokini who had given me a pretty bad beating was manager. My chin quivered the whole time. It wasn't that bad though, I managed to stop my chin from quivering at the thought of mustard, but my stomach still told me not to think about that. It sucks, mustard was so good to me.  It was about 1:30 am on departure of the S&S, letting us get to Ray's house not long after. Sitting and talking it didn't take long for us to make way to the hot tub. After a little talking into we got Ray in. We turned the jets on to cover up what was under the surface and took our shorts off. Jon and I started to touch eachother for about a half hour. When he saw Ray watching it was time to take a 30 sec break. Then Ray explained to us that it freaks him out that he isn't freaked out, so it was okay to continue. I moved jon to sit in front of me, that was devine. There is something about Jon's body that is just wonderful. He is so skinny. When I saw him get undressed it was like looking at art. His arms, his chest, his everything, carved to perfection; like a knife had gone along his whole body to make it obsolute, pure, perfect. He was a Greek God.   I know Jon doesn't look at me and my body in a sexual way, just that he is a big angery virgin and he wants sex from anyone that will put out. He is still not into the male body that much. I guess this is what happens when you grow up around CCS and the influence of good girls and boys.  I feel odd about this thing with Jon. He is an amazing man that I know, deep down, I want a relationship with. Somehow, though, knowing that he doesn't want a relationship makes things go a little better. I only wish that he found me attractive, that somewhat cuts down on my self esteem, but it is okay, I know two people who think I am -- or tell me they do -- so that makes up for that.

      Welp, Libby and I broke up and it was the best decision of my life. I knew it was going to happen about 12 hours in advance, and I knew just what to do to keep the relationship going, but I decided to break it off. Still, though, I got depressed. While at her house, I took a whole bottle of Lexipro (anti-d) and her and her mother found out. They got pissed off at me. Susan ran into the kitchen to fix up the most god awful drink ever, hot water and mustard. They took me into the bathroom and told me if I didn't drink it they would call 911. I raised it up to my lips a few times before I actually drank it. The instant it hit my tounge I started to vomit. I was vomiting all night.   When I awoke, I was in one of the best states of mind, and I wanted one of the best days of my life. The one thing that mad the day suck was that I woke up with a half chemical imbalance and a tick. Right now, anytime I get uneasy i chatter my teeth. Sometimes it happens when I am alone and in my element and not uneasy at all.  At about 7:30 - 8:00ish jo got out the door with his father's car, a true boat. He took me to VOA and we did a talkie walkie. He took some doubleplusgood pictures. We went over to the Ray's and we talked and laughed about many a thing. "So, do you think Jon Kerry is going to make it into the White House?"  This is the first time I will mention this in the blog, but Jon is the obtuse friend I keep bringing up as a ''special friend.'' Last night Jon and I spent some time naked in the hot tub of Ray's house. I was trying to work towards him and he was me for a little while. I was the one who made the first sexual touch when he told me he had an erection and I asked "do you want me to help you witht that," he said "sure." Then we just started touching eachother. We did that for a bit whtn I kinda brought his body to water level and started to give him head. Ray was still sitting about 3 feet away from us talking. It took Ray a minute or two to find out what was going on and when he did he was just seeing how long it took us to realize that we knew he knew. Jon put on his acting masque and kept his voice even. Before long Jon couldn't ignore the fact that Ray knew. Jon just kinda pullig his body down and signalled for me to back up. Ray then used his dog as an excuse to get out of the area so Jon and I could continue. Jon claims that he lost his erection because of the water and because he was going numb due to his position. I guess I have no reason to doubt him but I don't thing I did a good job. We were getting out of the hot tub to finish what we had started when Ray came back. Ray was clueless that we wanted to continue. After that we got out of the hot tub and m oved through Ray's house talking until we got to the front patio. We smoked a cig and went to WH. Constant jokes about my fear of mustard, my teeth chattering, and the thing between Jon and I happened here.   I don't think this thing with Jon wil progress into a relationship but I wouldn't mind. I am okay with us just being fuckbuds. I can't wait to finish what we started last night.

      I am fine when it comes to friendships, but in deep and honest life-partner situations, I am unsure about my self. I am not mature enough to end this relationship with Libby, no matter how many times in just the last two days we have come to it. Yesterday we broke up.  I don't remember what the fight was about, but it came to a very fast conculsion: we broke up. Then, I invited her our to the park with Bear. We spent some time -- two hours -- doing nothing but talking and throwing the ball. Many honest things came up. How we both often think about ending the relationship, who else we would like to have sex/be in a relationship with others, how she still honestly loves her ex, how I don't know if I love her, what we thought about eachother's body -- I said she was a little too fat and she said I was far from cute. We said everything in such a nice way to eachother though, everything was constructive.   The talk ended up with us getting back together on one condition: we would try to make it work, but the moment we knew it wouldn't, we would end the relationship.  When she came home, she talked to Lauren who had just found out that we broke up and was all excited until Libby told her the result. Before that, Lauren had mentioned how excited Susan (Libby's mother) was about the news.   Libby hates people who are two-faced. Mrs. Keller, Mrs. Kern, but she never mentions her mother. Her mother is just as two faced as anyone by telling me how happy she is that I am with Libby and then telling Libby that she needs to end the relationship. When all this came to a boil last night, Libby and I fled to my house with our two dogs.  Today, we got into it again. I was tired from the lack-lyster makeup sex that we had for about 3 1/2 hours, where in I never came, and she wanted me to get on me knees over her face and masturbate while she did as well. I didn't want to, I was tired and my penis thought it would be another dry run, but I did for about ten minutes. The fight happened when I told her that I wanted her to take me home before she went to work, because her mother was still in bitch-mode. I told her that the only reason I came back here was for her and if she wasn't even going to be here she would take me home.  Our fight today yeilded nothing. I am still here at her house at 2:40, an hour after she went to work, with her mother and one sister and her step dad -- a cool guy.  Now I just wish I could talk to a friend who would be impartial and who knows a little something about my constantly complex mental state.  I hope there is a Marshall's thing tonight. Somehow, everytime I go there I feel like the talk is just what I need. It feels like it was designed just for me. I find most the answers I seek in a day-to-day life there.

      Yesterday Libby and I spent alot of time with Ray. We met at S&S then we went to Game Junkie, spent some time in the parking lot, wardrove, went back to game Junkie, went to the mall, went to Danbarry Eastgate, went back to West Chester to spent time at the WH, then went home.   The interesting thing about last night, it was all filled with blunt sexuality. Libby and I flirted with Ray the whole night, during the movie Ray started to get a little used to it and somewhat involved himself. I have this somewhat odd obsession with Ray. I have never seen in real life an uncut penis, and I want to. Ray looks like he would be somewhat large, as per what I can tell from the bulge in his pants.  I liked being close to Ray last night. I like to put my arm around a man, and my hand on his leg, almost any man. Ray was just who I let my sexuality go on last night. I don't have a chance with him and I doubt I ever would, but I still wish I did, I wish I did with any man.

      I have not been true to my self or to a special friend of mine. He had asked me how I felt about him. I told him half the truth by saying I was sexualy attracted to him and the idea of a relationship with him would be...studder a little... He interupted me and sayed that he was just looking for sex and not into a gay relationship. I wanted to tell him that a relationship is what I was looking for and that one with him would be my dream. I didn't.  I feel like if we did in fact move in together, this would be the next best thing. We would see enough of eachother, we would have sex, and still be über-close friends. This is how I picture a relationship. But right now I feel like I need a new relationship. I need a man. Libby isn't what I need.  I think I have found someone I am interested in. His name is Jeff, a cute gay guy from Meijer. Libby introduced me to him ironic enough; she also incouraged me to send him a picture of my penis. He kinda liked it, I hope. I am honestly attracted to him, but I doubt it would work out, him being a good friend of Libby and all, but sex reigns over all...  My car, tomorrow, should be towed away so that I will get it back in about a week's time. I cannot wait.  I am so unsure of the future. I will no longer continue the relationship with Libby in this way, me going along for the ride, using her. I feel bad, but if I cut-off the relationship with her, I will be out in the cold. I am moving back in with my mother this summer, but must be out by July. Without Libby, I will have no place to go. Unless my friend would like for us to move in together in Middletown. I would hope that by July we would decide on it. I hope he says yes, I want this so much.

      My Monday was something to blog about, thus an update.  Monday was a good day. Jon came to Libby's to take me to the house of Ray and there we vidied "Clockwork Orange," a wonderful movie. Neither of them have seen it, somewhat of a shock to me. Both of them seem the type to have seen it. I left "Party Monter" at Ray's so he and Jon could have a look at it.   After that we went outside to chainsmoke. Ray and I had about 5 squares in like an hour. It took us quite some time to get out. When Jon went back into the house to get his iBook, Ray's parentals chumed with us for another 15 minutes. Outside we spoke for another half hour. Ray and I took on the task of teaching Jon to smoke. He didn't get the idea to inhale at first, but when he did, he did the usual gagcough. I found it so funny. Then we went home. Ray drove me back, Jon's mother seemed more off-her-rocker than usual, so he kinda rushed home.   This time I spent with thetwo was good. We talked about some things I would never usually talk about, and I saw a whole new side to Ray. I can't wait until the next time we get to hang out.

      Tonight, the Marshall's thing, and a little more...  I've put into action a plan I had a long time ago... Manytimes we get into situations where it is easy to just say the whole day was bad and be done with it, but what good does that do? Our day can be broken down into 3 parts, morning, afternoon, and evening. Why should we say we had a bad day when something happened in the morning? Why should we let one event dictate our day? I understand that a bad morning can get us off-track for a day, but we don't have to let that happen. I have decided that from now on I will live this way. My morning might be for crap, but at the end of the day I will be able to say "Well, my morning sucked, but in the afternoon things got a little better and everything was great by the evening." I am no longer going to just say I had a bad day.  With that mindset, I can also say I had a great day, like today. The morning started out with 2 movies, "The Omega Code," and "A Clockwork Orange." 'A Clockwork...' is one of the better movies of all times, a true cult classic. Death, rape, jail, revenge, all the good stuff.  Then Libby was off to work and it was time for me to work on the house. I cleaned, cooked, and bathed 7 Germans. After that I headed out to the Marshall's thing.  Tonight's topic was one of the best. While it followed the same theme as all of the others, this one seemed to pop out. I felt a true connection. One of the better parts was talking about the everlasting kingdome and hoe we don't have to wait for it as it has come already. And how knowing the Kingdome isn't The Kingdome, but that Jesus is The Kingdome and the only was in is to have a relationship with him. Ways to have a relationship such as community, faith, et cetera are presented each day, and that we just need to open out eyes to find everything we have a right to by God. All this brought about some heavy thought during the night.  After the thing was over, Jon, Ray, Ben, and I all hung outside his (Marshall's) house talking about what to do. I thought up movies ("A Clockwork..." and "Party Monster"). but we didn't have a place to go. After many jokes and talking I thought up "The Future Park of Liberty Township." I had no clue what this would bring us.   We went to the park, about 1/2 a mile away, still in DW. We took a ride in Ben's truck around the lot, then dit 2 spinouts in Ray's car. This brought me closer to God I think. Some of the townspeople didn't think so; they called the cops and we had no idea. We regrouped the cars and sat around talking and Jon taking pictures until the Sheriff showed up. He explained what kind of criminal charges could be brought against us and how the park closes at dusk even though it isn't a park but a park none the less due to the fact that one day it will be, in another 6 years. After a few heart racing moments, we just sat around and talked to him for about an hour. He turned out to be a cool guy.  We decided that sitting in an empty lot was no longer a good idea, so we went to the WF. I got a BCC and a watter, Ray got a Coke, and Jon and Ben got watter alone. Jon payed for Ray's Coke. We sat around for about 2 hours until 11:00 when Susan called me asking what the hell I was doing out  at 11:00 on a Sunday night, then she ordered me back home. At the House, I did manage to scare Ray and Ben with my honesty, I think Jon was a little giddy about it.  Ray asked Jon to lift me home, and Jon didn't mind.  After we left the WH, I talked to this friend I keep mentioning. He asked me what I honestly felt about him, I told him the truth about how I like him, but picturing a relationship would be tough. He said he wasn't looking for a gay relationship, just someone to have sex with. That would work out best anyway. The truth on my side is: I see him as a perfect boyfriend but he is my best friend right now anyway, and if he wants to have sex, then that is what a boyfriend is to me: a best friend you have sex with. Even without sex, I would still love to be around him. Our friendship seems to grow everytime we connect and that would keep me happy, I wouldn't need sex.  After that, we talked about the idea of the two of us moving in together in Middletown, I could break up with Libby that way. I care for Libby, but as a friend. I would love to move in with him. I hope this happens, I would be so happy.  On a scale from one to ten, this day would be the highest ten.

      While my life may seem like a walk in the park to you average readers out there, it isn't. These problems may be simple in concept, but tough in practice.  I wen't with Libby's step-father's boss at A.R.T. to Hamfest yesterday, up in Dayton. It was not uncool. Miles and miles of ham radio electronics. I picked up a new freq. modulator for the radio I am building, only 20 bucks and it was top of the line. I wasn't all there when I went, though. I had just spent the night out with Libby, Ray, Allison, and Jon and didn't make it back home until close to 3, I had to get uo\p at 4:30 to make it to the Awful House by 5:45. Then I didn't get to sleep until 3 again. I have those dark bags under my eyes now, hehe.  The night out with Ray and Jon and Allison went off well. I got the idea that Allison was a little uneasy around us, okay considering her life thus far (rich, uberconservative, christian, private school goer). We ate at Perkins where a newage hippy gave us rocks with happy face stickers on them. She said it would make us happy -- I don't now if we hadn't been loud and laughing enough at that table or not, but I would say we had been. It is a great idea in concept, but I wonder how many people it would touch. Something for the book I would say.  I spent my free time over the last few days (all 4 hours) setting up a Linux box in Libby's room. I have yet to do much but download some music, play games, surft, et cetera.  I still don't know about my feelings towards Libby and my other friend yet, but they will sort out.  Now I am on my way to meet up with Jon at this Christian thing, my 2nd time and I will be showing up alone, meh

      ^^ part of a joke i was treated to at an interesting christian thing, but it serves as a point to me now  i have been developing my feelings a little more and found that people i thought i just had lust for i have true feelings for. i am confused in my life  i have a friend and we have mutual sexual feelings for eachother, but i think i have feelings thatgo deeper than that. i am afraid to tell him because i dont want to ruin a good thing, but these feelings arent going away. as i said before, i would be open to sexual-only relations with him if thats all he wants  libby is now more comfortable with me gay side. when we started going out, i was gay, and changed to bi for her. she wants us to have a threesome, okay...  other parts of my life: geek side-- -i may be hosting a lan party soon, nice way to get together -i have been writing tutorials on how to do linux things at yeaclan.com's forums. they go over well, helped out 3 people now. my next tutorial will be http serving with apache  school-- -lets not talk about that, it is almost out  mental health-- -i have taken control of my eating disorder and have not purged in 3 weeks, a big deal for me concidering last month i was up to 6 or so times a day -i have not cut my self in those 3 weeks either, another big deal  employment-- -no job yet, but soon i hope, linked with car  car-- -no car yet, but soon i hope. the truck has problems, so we arent doing it anymore   thats about the scope of things i guess...

      these days all have started to seem the same to me. my feelings for special people in my life have grown both stronger and weaker, but they are the same feelings. i am still torn between a love and lust, still. i am becoming a better persion through happieness, but i still dont want to carry on.  i told my girlfriend about the feelings i have for one of my friends, my lust for him. she took it somewhat well. she feels like she can trust me; pitty her trust.  nothing new has happened. i am still without my own form of transit, but it comes soon. i still have no job, but it comes soon too. i hope they come soon.   nothing right now, in my life, seems to be all that great. i am only getting by in school for the last month, i am only making enough money to live with my little side computer fixing biz. it seems that at the age of 17 i have become a living dead-end. where can my life go? should i even know? should i spend nights like this wondering about things like that? should i even care about spending nights like this wondering things like that? should i even wonder about caring about spending nights... you get the idea. i would like to be care free and just let life happen, but i am a little too high-strung for that to happen. i am impulsive yet contemplative with everything i do, that sucks.  tonight i will go to bed, dream about life going on all around me, wake up, see life going on all around me, and still i will feel un-invited. that is my order.

      Yesterday was a good day for me...  I have a friend that I've liked for quite some time now, a great guy and a frustrated virgin. I have feelings for him on a few different levels, but they all kinda started with the physical layer. I flirt with him on a day-to-day basis, but it never seemed to get me anywhere. Now, possibly only out of frustration with virginity, he would be with me in an intimate way! I was so excited I filled up a few journal pages and that still wasn't enough. I couldn't go telling my girlfriend that I care about more as a friend. I had no one to tell, so I had to feel like I've made it public yet with few knowing. Thank God for Blogs.  Somehow I feel like I'm using him though... I do care a lot about him and I know that this little thing won't get in our friendship, but still...  I must admit that I hope this turns into a relationship, but I don't want to get my hopes up all that high.

      I know it has been a long time since I kept what reader(s) I have up to date on my life, I just kinda let go of the blog. Oh well, I'm back for now.  I work about every night right now, trying to keep money coming in. I only earn abou $500 bi-weekly, but it is enough to keep my head from going under.   My education is switching i's courses again. I am still to take Spanish at Sinclair this summer, but I am not going to the TechPrep program. I will just finish HighSchool ASAP and then go on to ITT Tech.  I moved out of my mother's house and then back in, now I stay with my girlfriend and at my mothers house.  Things with my girlfriend you ask? Well, the thing is, they are good, but I'm still not sure if I love her as a girlfriend. There is this guy I like - alot - but I'm sure he isn't gay.  I fix computers now, in addition to my two other jobs. I don't make much money only because I don' charge people for the most part -- but that is going to change.  Well, I am at school right now anyway, and it is time to go to gym, so until next time...

      Sorry I haven't been posting, I just started this blog and already I am slacking. Oh well, I refuse to give up on it, I have nothing better to do with my time than to spill random news of life on the web.  The manga is coming along just fine. I think it will be called Yaoi's Angels. A story of crime fighting yaoi angels working for god. I assure you it will be better than it sounds. My artist is working with me well, and I hope to come out with the complete set of character sketches in a week or two.  I might soon start working at Hollywood Video, I need the money and the job won't be that bad. I need to pay my phone bill and then, after I pay the mother $200, I can have my car back. Woohoo. I need to start drivig again, the public transit system in Ohio is... well I won't get into that today, and it is getting old getting rides from friends all the time.  I am going to take my Ham Radio test soon. I score a average of 90% on the qrz.com test, made from the same questions as the real test. The I will have to build my station, I will be sure to keep you updated.  The artist I recomend you listen to this week is Mark Farina (Air Farina album). You can buy it on iTunes.

      The only thing interesting that happened to me today was that, for no reason, I decided to check back with spymac to find version 3! The long anticipated update to the spymac we behold. I stoped hanging around spymac when I had so many things piled up on me that I had no time for anything not productive. I still have a heap on my plate, but I am not working so it workes out a little better.  Right now I am working with my school's IT dep't to help 'secure' their Windows network. They have a copy of Windows Server 2003 that I get to mess around with so it can be fun - I am trying to get them to let me use it at home too, just for fun. They make my job easy anyway because they don't practice even the basics of network  security. Not that I know a whole lot about everything but it seems that I know more about them than the administration and way more than most of my peers - I do try to be humble ^_^.  I am working on a yaoi manga right now, you can expect it to be interesting. I am the author and I have an artist working with me. Our first issue is to be out by March the first, I hope.  I will be sure to keep you posted on it all, so untill next post, good hypertime.
