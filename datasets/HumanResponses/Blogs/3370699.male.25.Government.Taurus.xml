      Imagine a president who felt your pain, understood your fears, and spoke the truth; a man (or woman) who ignored both public opinion polls and pundits to lead from the heart.    While our hypothetical hero may seem like the perfect candidate for the Oval Office, these attributes are picked up most easily by lazy media that distribute them in various forms to a sporadically attentive public. In a political system that rewards calculation, consideration, and compromise, it is difficult to impress upon Americans - who yearn for decisive action in their nationally elected representative – the importance of achieving a balance.   Like few Presidents before him, our current chief executive has been able to harness the media to create and refine his image throughout the term of his presidency. His presidential appearances are carefully scripted and artfully choreographed. He often accepts queries only from a pre-selected list of reporters. His handlers divert attention away from his rhetorical liabilities ("We need an energy bill that encourages consumption") to concentrate on crafting an image of George W. Bush, the plain-spoken, no-nonsense, American President.   The Bush handlers have worked assiduously limiting the President's unscripted policy speeches, which severely test his rhetorical abilities and his grasp of the substantive issues. In his most recent televised appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, the Bush-men had the program taped from inside the Oval Office to convey all the majesty of the American Presidency so as to bolster his flagging public approval. His fanciful landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln was no less an effort to paint the president as a war hero in the face of worldwide protests and a service record that paints a very different picture. The prominence and frequency with which his crew employs the Crawford ranch as a backdrop is not accidental either. It serves to deflect attention away from his Yale/Harvard-pedigree.  The initial barrage of Bush's reelection ads also seek to employ powerful imagery: caskets of fallen fireman are enshrouded with American flags. In purporting to demonstrate Bush as resolute in the face of unspeakable evil, these commercials attempt to identify the President with part of the American experience that is above partisan critique. It also allows Bush to avoid addressing the more difficult questions surrounding intelligence failures in his administration and his more questionable foreign policy program.  Building and maintaining the president’s image is an unending and painstaking process. It requires a constant stream of attention that leverages the selective attention of a usually disengaged public. His reelection campaign is currently asking employees at the newly created Department of Homeland Security to devote their time to exploring photo opportunities for the President to reestablish his security credentials.  Yet perhaps the most pernicious activity of the Bush image machine comes not from any dubious portrayal of the President, but the ferocity with which it strikes out at those who would attempt to paint a different picture.   The list of civil servants, politicians and reporters who have drawn the administration's ire for highlighting facets of the president's leadership at odds with his image is long. Their most recent target is Richard Clarke, a career counter terrorism expert, who revealed that the administration had not done everything it could to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. Although Clarke in no way personally attacks the president - his most strident criticisms are leveled at Condolezza Rice - his charges seriously undermine the presentation of the president as an attentive, hands-on leader.   In response, the Bush administration launched a series of attacks, challenging Clarke's personal integrity and professional reputation, with considerable success.  Recent polls indicate 50 percent of the public believes that Clarke is motivated by financial or political gain.   The old adage that states the value of pictures outstrips words has never been more right. In an era in which pictures often become the news, it is difficult to underestimate their importance. The power of an image lies in its evocative ability and its ability to long outlast reason.   The American imagination is George Bush's greatest asset. We desire that our leaders be forthright, decisive and strong. Yet with revelations occurring steadily that demonstrate a growing incongruity between the leadership we are promised and the leadership we are offered, it is clearly time to conjure up an image that fits closer with reality.

      The  urlLink Post  reports today that despite the recent focus on political polarization - the advent of Red and Blue states - voters are increasingly refusing either party label. Since 1987, the proportion of unaffiliated voters has jumped from 16 to 24 percent. Democratic identification has fallen from 51 to 43 percent while Republican identification has remained relatively stable at 33 percent.  Here are some of the most interesting sections:  "Myriad polls over the past two decades have shown that voters, when asked to identify themselves politically, divide about one-third Democratic, one-third Republican and one-third independent. But in terms of registration, most have opted for one major party or the other -- perhaps because, in some states, that was the only way they could vote in a party primary. Only recently have registration figures begun to reflect the poll numbers.  "What's so significant about the rise of the unaffiliated? Well, it's one thing to tell a pollster that you consider yourself "independent." No particular consequence arises from that self-identification. But to register as unaffiliated is a stronger statement of preference (or lack of one). Political parties talk about the "base," and how to energize it. These numbers suggest that the base is eroding, or at least is harder to identify and rely on.  All the evidence seem to point to a heavily divided electorate, and pundits are predicting high turnouts for 2004. A recent  urlLink Pew Research Poll  found that the swing vote will be smaller in 2004 than in past elections. This article seems to suggest something very different.

      It seems that the normally well-disciplined Bush team is showing signs of crumbling under the pressure as increased media scrutiny and Democratic criticism seem to be taking their toll.   Exhibit #1:  During a Housed Armed Services Committee hearing, when questioned by the panel's leading Democrat, Rep. Ike Skelton (D-MO), about the difficulties in Iraq, Wolfowitz slammed the media accusing them of cowardice. "Frankly, part of our problem," Wolfowitz said, "is a lot of press are afraid to travel very much. So they sit in Baghdad, and they publish rumors."  The comments weren't very well received, and Wolfowitz  urlLink apologized  shortly thereafter.   Exhibit #2:  The President's number two man fell victim to a similar if more flagrant outburst when he told Sen. Leahy (D-VT) to "fuck off" on the Senate floor. The Vermont Senator has been a vocal critic of Halliburton and has called for a congressional investigation of the Vice President and his former company's receipt of a no-bid contact. The magnanimous Leahy responded: “I think he was just having a bad day. I was kind of shocked to hear that kind of language on the floor.”  I'm just waiting on Rumsfeld.

      The  urlLink Associated Press  is suing the Pentagon and the Air Force to gain access to all of Bush's service records during Vietnam.  Can anyone tell me why this wasn't done four years ago?

      The  urlLink Washington Post  reports that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to order Vice President Cheney to release information about confidential meetings held with energy lobbyists. Given the controversy surrounding this issue, I thought it might be worth taking another look at Scalia's recusal refusal memo.  The complete document is located at  urlLink FindLaw . But a couple of sections are worth noting.   Scalia begins by explaining that we should focus on the facts, not the facts as they are reported to us. In other words, we should judge his partiality-impartiality by what he says, not by what is reported. Take him at his word, he's a stand-up guy.  Scalia then goes on to assure us that "it was not an intimate setting."   "Hunting was done in two- or three-man blinds. As it turned out, I never hunted in the same blind as the Vice President. Nor was I alone with him at any time during the trip, except perhaps for instances so brief and unintentional that I would not recall them."  The kicker...  "As the newspaper editorials in the appended section make clear, I have received a good deal of embarassing criticism and adverse publicity with the matter at issue here-even to the point of becoming (as the motion cruelly but accurately states) 'fodder for late-night comedians.' ... If I could have done so in good conscience, I would have been pleased to demonstrate my integrity, and immediately silence the criticism, by getting off the case."  Almost makes you want to give the guy a hug.

      Another Clinton rumination.  Too often Clinton’s centrism is viewed as a response to the politics he confronted. The conventional wisdom: Massive losses in the 1994 mid-term elections caused Clinton to steer rightward.   How true is this? Clinton was never an out-and-out liberal.  He campaigned as a New Democrat, the titular expression for a liberal pragmatist. He surrounded himself with an array of colorful characters from across the entire political spectrum – Bensten, Rubin, Reich. His advisors were constantly feeding him disparate advice. Disagreements were common and dissension was rife; the only way policy was created in the Clinton White House was through extensive deliberation and compromise.   The President used conflicting advice to construct policy that seemed to make the most sense. Sometimes it appeared more liberal (i.e. a minimum wage hike) sometimes more conservative (i.e. NAFTA), but it was never ideologically driven. In fact, it was unclear to many pundits and politicians how liberal or conservative Clinton was, and that was the point.   He found solutions to America’s problems by farming on both sides of the fence.   Contrast this with the Bush White House. Bush’s advisors, perhaps with the sole exception of Colin Powell, are decidedly monochromatic. Discussion is sorely wanting, and dissenting voices are stifled. Ideology reigns.

      Great little piece in the   urlLink Atlantic Unbound  about Bush's reaction to the 9-11 attacks.   Here's the meat:  "That moment exposes Bush's character. It reveals what his press conferences proclaim: his incapacity. If he were George W. Smith, what job would he be qualified for? Bush's presidency can be seen as one long cover-up of the most obvious thing about him. A life of upward failure, of being his father's son, left him without "sand," my nineteenth century-born father's word for the residue of strength acquired by "standing on your own two feet" and 'taking your medicine.' Bush never stood on his own feet, never took his medicine—and he has never been his own man."  "Competence, prudence, policy over politics: these are not the words to describe George W. Bush's conduct of government. If we doubted Clinton's character, we were reassured by his intelligence and command of the scene. Bush lacks these compensations. His vaunted 'moral clarity' is as much strut as conviction. He achieves certainty by arresting thought."  Well put.

      Watching Clinton last Sunday, June 20, on Sixty Minutes made me realize what he had  that both Bush and Kerry lack – humility.  Neither contender for America’s highest political office seems to have that quality that allows him to transcend partisan affiliations.   Neither Kerry nor Bush has the capacity to recognize their own fallability and are even less capable of expressing it publicly. Perhaps it is naive to expect that they could.  In Clinton, I see a clearly flawed figure with complex feelings and emotions; someone who has climbed incredibly high and fallen incredibly far. He had that rare combination of incredible talent, unbridled ambition and boundless opportunity. His entire life - an intermingling of public and private experiences; and private experiences that have become public - has been marked by a series of highs and lows, achievements and failures.   But what became most clear about Clinton was that he had doubts about what he did. Perhaps because his legacy in some sense was equally triumphant and tragic, it becomes  easier to understand the source of Clinton's humility. Might it be also that Bush’s steadfast refusal to admit mistakes and Kerry’s creative caveats have made this quality much more poignant, endearing.  History, the ultimate arbiter, provide us with the best assessment of Clinton's legacy. In the meantime, I would offer only that I think he is at least good man, who didn't always do good.   "Whether or not I am a good man is, of course, only for God to decide. I am not as good as my strongest supporters believe or as I hope to become, nor as bad as my most ardent critics assert."    -- William Jefferson Clinton,  My Life

      On June 17 Vice President Cheney talked to CNBC's Gloria Borger about the purported meeting that took place in Prague between Mohamed Atta, the leader of the September 11 attacks, and an Iraqi official.  Despite repeated   urlLink attempts  to sell this as fact, it is unconfirmed that any meeting ever took place.  Borger: "Well, let's go to Mohamed Atta for a minute, because you mentioned him as well. You have said in the past that it was, quote, 'pretty well confirmed.' "   Cheney: "No, I never said that."   Borger: "Okay."   Cheney: "Never said that."   Borger: "I think that is . . . "   Cheney: "Absolutely not. What I said was the Czech intelligence service reported after 9/11 that Atta had been in Prague on April 9th of 2001, where he allegedly met with an Iraqi intelligence official. We have never been able to confirm that nor have we been able to knock it down."   On Dec. 9, 2001, Cheney spoke with NBC's Tim Russet about the alleged meeting.   Cheney: "Well, what we now have that's developed since you and I last talked, Tim, of course, was that report that -- it's been pretty  well confirmed  that he did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April, several months before the attack. Now, what the purpose of that was, what transpired between them, we simply don't know at this point, but that's clearly an avenue that we want to pursue." (emphasis added)

      I'm so tired of reading articles about how important it is that Democrats remain competitive in the South. Why don't pundits ever assert that Bush must be competitive in New England to have a chance in 2004?   If Bush carried the entire South - Ala., La., Miss., Ark., Ga., S.C., N.C., Tenn. - he would net a total of 79 electoral votes. Meanwhile if Kerry swept New England - N.Y., Mass., N.H., Vt., N.J., Conn., R.I., Maine - he would walk away with 80 electoral votes.  To see exactly what I'm talking about, check out  urlLink this site .  I'm not advocating that Kerry abandon the South. He is running a national campaign and its important that he not evince regional favoritism. At the same time, his campaign ought to think strategically when planning his itinerary. After all, when is the last time you heard the Bush campaign schedule a stop in Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut or Rhode Island?

      An interesting item from  urlLink CJR , the Columbia Journalism Review.  Susan Q. Stranahan  urlLink examines   a couple of recent stump speeches Kerry gave in Ohio and New Jersey that are very unlike some of his more traditional “numbingly nuanced non-answers.”   I think the changes in these speeches – or the changes in their delivery – warrant some attention. They seem to provide the first indication that Kerry actually stands for something. He comes off as being incredibly genuine, a quality not commonly ascribed to the Democratic candidate.  In brevity, we see decisiveness. In candor, we see authenticity. If Kerry is to win over alienated moderates and elusive independents, these are two qualities that he sorely needs to establish.  Collectively, we can stomach a lot: personal moral failings, chronic contortions of the English language, and any number of gaffes, misjudgments, and blunders. But we cannot abide a politician who seems disingenuous. Nothing so repulses the public like the idea that someone isn’t who they say they are.   Like a bevy of dubious teenagers we have an innate quality that allows us to detect fakers.    Although these two speeches seem to be an abberation, I hope Kerry is not so much donning a cape, as he is escaping his cocoon.

       urlLink The Hill  reports that Congressman Chris Bell (D-TX), who was ousted by his primary opponent, is filing a complaint with the ethics committee against Tom Delay, a fellow Texan. The complaint alleges that the Majority leader laundered money, improperly influenced legislative races in Texas and misused federal agencies.  Republicans are shrieking that the complaint is utterly groundless - "It is all based on press clipppings" - and amounts to nothing more than partisan rancour.  In response to the complaint, Delay spokesman Jonathan Grella issued the following statement: "In the absence of an agenda or leadership, Democrats' desperate over-reliance on  caricature assassination  is a clear signal that they do not take seriously the challenges our country faces."  Doesn't he mean character? And I think corruption and mismanagement are pretty serious issues.

      Much has been made of  urlLink Bush’s attempt  to enlist support from the Vatican to pressure American Bishops to publicly chastise (by refusing communion) pro-choice office holders.   The obvious target is John Kerry. The Bush campaign is working assiduously to dismantle Kerry’s Catholic credibility. Their message: “Kerry is not a real Catholic.”   The battle for Catholic voters – a crucial demographic for both parties – is being waged on many levels. The  urlLink Washington Post  reports that an antiabortion group has launched an ad campaign against Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick who is not comfortable with the idea of denying communion.  The best part is the last few paragraphs.  “David O'Brien, a professor of Roman Catholic studies at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., said … all bishops must ‘protect the integrity of the church's teaching’ by speaking out against the ‘grave scandal’ that results from high-profile Catholics flouting church doctrine.   “But, he said, ‘if they push this too hard, it could easily backfire on them. People are going to say, 'Where is their moral leadership on a whole lot of issues? How many bishops have resigned because of their mishandling of sexual abuse? Why didn't they speak on the war in Iraq? What effort did they make to bring to the attention of their own people the positions they've taken on war, capital punishment and poverty?’   “In short, O'Brien said, ‘when they come down personally on [particular politicians], people are going to say they have political motives -- and maybe some of them do.’”   It seems very much like selective moral outrage.

      Our extended occupation of Iraq and inability to find WMDs has adversely affected our credibility abroad. It has done irreparable damage to the status of the United Nations, and fractured long-standing alliances. But perhaps the most insidious consequence of the invasion has been our standing in the Arab world. A recent  urlLink poll  of 15,000 Saudis found that almost half have a favorable view of Osama Bin Laden's rhetoric.  That Saudi Arabia abets terrorists is nothing new. The connection between the Saudi ruling family and terrorists is well-documented. What is perhaps a much more significant revelation is the groundswell of public support that terrorist outfits seemed to have attained.

      He has an airport and an aircraft carrier, two post offices and a courthouse named after him; and there was talk of carving up Mount Rushmore to fit him on it.    urlLink The Hill  reports that "since 1990, lawmakers have introduced at least 30 pieces of legislation honoring Reagan. They have introduced five resolutions recognizing his birthday and two bills implementing a national memorial in his honor and awarded him a Congressional Gold Medal."  Now congressional Republicans are pushing to have Reagan's inky visage placed on the $10 bill replacing Alexander Hamilton, America's first Treasury Secretary.  The architech of the plan is  urlLink Grover Norquist,  which is more than enough reason to balk at the idea.   I think it would make more sense to put him on $100 bill. After all, Franklin was never president either.

      You know school districts are in trouble when they have to sue appropriators to loosen up the purse strings.  The  urlLink Washington Post reports  that more than half the states in the country are involved in litigation over funding of public education.  Public education in America is becoming synonymous with low-income, low-quality education. The No Child Left Behind Act is becoming farcical. Why is it that we can  pay contrators $100,000 a year to rebuild Iraqi infrastructure and not provide decent salaries to teachers in struggling schools?  I have some ideas. But we'll leave that for another time.

      In remembering Ronald W. Reagan, we should be sure that we acknowledge both his achievements and his failures, his policies and his persona.  Reagan swept into office preparing to dismantle federal programs that he thought were overly intrusive and unduly burdensome. But Reagan, despite his rhetoric, was not the bane of big government that his supporters often claim.  "For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.   "You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?"  After delivering such remarks, Reagan then proceeded to spend like there was no tomorrow, which perhaps he thought there wasn't. The  urlLink deficit soared   during Reagan's eight-year presidency, to be surpassed only by another Republican President, George W. Bush. Although both actively campaigned on limiting government's role, both oversaw substantial increases in total government spending -- Bush's profligacy has far exceeded Reagan's.

      A great quote in the  urlLink Washington Post  today.  Kerry campaign spokesman David Wade responding to Bush accusations that Kerry is too rich for mainstream America:   "Boneheaded attacks from this bunch are as insulting as they are ironic. It's downright hypocritical coming from the campaign of a president whose connections got him into a 'Champagne Unit' of the National Guard during Vietnam and whose path was paved with privilege from Andover to Arbusto oil to the Texas Rangers…This guy who was born on third base and thought he hit a triple is going to engage in a sad game of class warfare? . . . I don't think a lot of Americans remember Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy because of where they came from, they remember them for what they did to make America stronger. Good luck finding Americans who think that way about George Bush."   Boo-Yah!

Democrats generally scored much higher than Republicans. Kerry's votes aligned with the Church a Senate-high 60.9 percent of the time.   Republicans were less pleased with the results. Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), who scored only 34.4 percent, was livid - "I vote the way I vote because I believe it - it's part of my conscience. I think this issue is an effort to rationalize an issue."

      Despite Bush's repeated attempts to portray the current situation in Iraq as an extension or sequel to the WWII, most of the public has not followed the script.  The independent and nonpartisan  urlLink Polling Report  shows that while 90 percent of the public believes that WWII was a "just" war, less than a majority believes the same is true about Iraq. In fact, of all the major wars fought by the United States, only the Vietnam War was considered less justified.

      Although he didn't appear at the convention, Vanessa Kerry's hamster has achieved celebrity status and for the first time ever he shares his harrowing tale. Yet little is known about the hamster. In the  urlLink New York Times  he offers a first hand account of the incident and some thoughts about the man who saved his life.   "I saw my whole life pass before my eyes. My life has not been all that interesting, so it wasn't exactly like watching 'The Godfather I and II.' I mean, I'm a hamster. I could see a bright light, but I seemed to be on a wheel that rotated as I ran, so I never got any closer. But I was aware of a shining, all-loving divine rodent presence telling me: 'It's not time yet. You have more to do on earth.'  "'Like what?' I asked, but I could already feel myself back in my body, could feel strong hands yanking open my cage and pulling me upward to safety.  "Yes, it was John Kerry. Help was on the way. Yes, he did perform CPR. Yes, he did perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. There is no doubt that I owe him my life. On the other hand, the water went up to his chest, O.K.? I mean, this wasn't exactly PT-109.  "It's also true that I wound up suing the family. I have continuing health problems, including a partial paralysis on my right side that makes it difficult for me to drink out of a regular water bottle. And let's just say there aren't going to be any Licorice Jr.'s. One of the small pleasures of hamster life denied.  "There was a settlement. I can't talk about it. I got enough to pay for a daily home health aide."

      I just saw Ben Affleck. Again. This guy is everywhere; despite not having any official speaking role at the convention. It may not be so surprising. With so little newsworthy events happening the media ( urlLink New York Times ,  urlLink Arizona Republic ,  urlLink Associated Press ) has been only to happy to oblige the charasmatic, well-spoken, and surprisngly well-informed actor.  Rumors abound about whether he is paving the way for a political career. He certainly hasn't ruled out the idea of a running for some office in his homestate of Massachusetts. And to be perfectly honest. I think he would make a good candidate, and certainly it doesn't hurt that he would be running in a state that votes overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates.   I never thought much of actors who tried to parlay their celebrity into personal or political gain. But Affleck seems to genuinely care about the issues, at least enough to learn to speak about them intelligently. He certainly had no problem giving it back to Robert Novak when he appeared on Crossfire today.  Actors make naturally campaigners. And Affleck seems more adept with the media than most. He has already mastered some of the most important rhetorical devices: self-deprecating humor, equivocation, deflection, and timing.  He may have a future in politics, if he wants it.

       Some Advice for Barak Obama:    Barak Obama, the newly-minted star of the Democratic Party, has gone from being a little-known state senator representing Chicago’s South Side to the party's prospective nominee for 2008 or 2012. Such an accession almost defies the term meteoric. But his arrival seems to be just in the nick of time.  Since Clinton’s retirement in 2000, the party has been rudderless, and lacking in true leadership. Obama easily fills the void. He provides assertive leadership, grounded thoroughly in traditional democratic values. He appeals to many constituencies simultaneously, effortlessly. His capacity to alternately woo and wow voters is a testament to his extraordinary political skill. He can exicite the base without alienating moderates. His exceptional convention address served to reaffirm what most people already knew: This guy is going to be big.  But Obama's most difficult task will come after November 2. With Democrats already salivating about the prospect of him heading the ticket in 2008 or beyond, Obama must learn to be patient. After coming so far so fast he must now resign himself to being simply the junior senator from Illinois. His political career is now dependent upon his ability to navigate the arcane folkways of the Senate, compile a successful legislative record, and develop a rapport with his colleagues.   All of these things will be put in jeopardy if Obama seeks to maintain a high profile. Grandstanding, as it will inevitably be perceived, will earn him the resentment of his colleagues, compromising his ability to pass legislation and advance his own agenda. He must learn to keep his head down – no easy task when you are the new darling of the media.   Fortunately for Obama, he is not the first politician to achieve notoriety before entering the Senate. In fact, there is a pair of successful senators who were stars in their own right before becoming U.S. Senators. Both Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) pursued a remarkably effective strategy of eschewing media attention in favor of nuts and bolts legislative work. Both have managed to avoid the spotlight, instead concentrating on crafting good legislation and representing their constituents. And in each case it has paid marvelous dividends. Both Clinton and Dole have gained the respect (and in some cases even admiration) of many of their Senate colleagues for their attention to the less glamorous part of governing.   Obama would do well to follow their example. Clearly he is a bright shining star. And he is the future of the Democratic Party, just not yet.

      It was his night. Bill Clinton's return to center stage, if only momentarily, had many Democrats wishing he was their nominee for 2004. Anyone who watched last night's convention knows that there was only one word that can be used to describe Clinton's performance: masterful. If not for that pesky 25th amendment there is little doubt that this man would still occupy the White House. And probably remain there indefinitely.   His energy was contagious. His self-deprecating manner was refreshing. But for most Democrats I think the best part of Clinton's speech was&nbsp;his bold&nbsp;ability to reclaim terrority that his party has conceded to the Republicans since 9/11: Faith, Values, Patriotism, Strength.   This is where the  urlLink speech  really got good:   "When I was in office, the Republicans were pretty mean to me. When I left and made money, I became part of the most important group in the world to them. At first I thought I should send them a thank you note -- until I realized they were sending you the bill.   "They protected my tax cuts while:    Withholding promised funding for the Leave No Child Behind Act, leaving over 2 million children behind   Cutting 140,000 unemployed workers out of job training   Cutting 100,000 working families out of child care assistance   Cutting 300,000 poor children out of after school programs   Raising out of pocket healthcare costs to veterans   Weakening or reversing important environmental advances for clean air and the preservation of our forests.    "Everyone had to sacrifice except the wealthiest Americans, who wanted to do their part but were asked only to expend the energy necessary to open the envelopes containing our tax cuts...   "In this year's budget, the White House wants to cut off federal funding for 88,000 uniformed police, including more than 700 on the New York City police force who put their lives on the line on 9/11. As gang violence is rising and we look for terrorists in our midst, Congress and the President are also about to allow the ten-year-old ban on assault weapons to expire. Our crime policy was to put more police on the streets and take assault weapons off the streets. It brought eight years of declining crime and violence. Their policy is the reverse, they're taking police off the streets and putting assault weapons back on the streets...   "These policies have turned the projected 5.8 trillion dollar surplus we left-enough to pay for the baby boomers retirement-into a projected debt of nearly 5 trillion dollars, with a 400 plus billion dollar deficit this year and for years to come. How do they pay for it? First by taking the monthly surplus in Social Security payments and endorsing the checks of working people over to me to cover my tax cut. But it's not enough. They are borrowing the rest from foreign governments, mostly Japan and China. Sure, they're competing with us for good jobs but how can we enforce our trade laws against our bankers?"   I think most Democrats believe that the majority of Americans&nbsp;support their policies, especially when it comes to domestic issues. It's hard to imagine that most people believe that the wealthiest 3 percent deserve thousands of dollars in tax breaks while education is underfunded, and healh care costs are skyrocketing.

      Kerry doesn't need to go far to find pontificating pundits ready to offer guidance on any and all matters of his campaign. The internet is full of would-be campaign advisors working pro bono.  The most recent unbidden advice focuses on what he should say at the Democratic National Convention this week.  Both the  urlLink Atlantic Monthly  and the  urlLink American Prospect  provide Kerry with some ideas about what he should say and how he should say it.  While the suggestions proferred are generally good ones, I think it's important that we put this speech in perspective. First, although it may be the single most important speech he delivers, it is not the single most important act of his campaign. That honor would have to fall either to his selection of John Edwards as his running mate, or his decision to forgo public financing. Second, the speech cannot possibly live up to the hype. Journalists have succeeded in setting the bar incredibly high, creating unrealistic expectations about what the speech should/could accomplish. It will not introduce him to every voter who doesn't know him. It will not turn swing voters into Kerry supporters. It will not give him a huge bounce in the polls.  Kerry should avoid overthinking this one. Perhaps the best advice for Kerry would be to simply keep it simple.

      Apparently Bush's payroll records have been found. The White House asserts that although Bush received no pay and earned no credits during the last three months of his national guard service (July 1 to September 30, 1972), the records are irrelevant.  According to the White House, Bush had fulfilled his requirements and did not need to log any flight hours during this last quarter.  I don't know if we'll ever really know if Bush shirked his service. But it has been apparent for sometime is that Bush had little use for military service. His dedication to the National Guard mirrors that of his other business and personal commitments throughout most of his life.  More to come...

      The  urlLink Electoral Vote Predictor  has updated its main page to include state by state polling&nbsp;data that&nbsp;is accessible by highlighting&nbsp;each specific state. With a quick look,&nbsp;a couple of things become immediately&nbsp;clear.   Right now, Kerry has greater electoral strength than Bush. Kerry can almost assuredly count on receiving 217 electoral votes from Blue States. Bush will likely&nbsp;receive&nbsp;192 electoral votes from his Red States.   There are four states which Bush must win to remain in the White House:  Arizona  (10),  Ohio  (21),  Florida  (27) and  Missouri  (11). There combined electoral weight - 69 - would be more than enough for Bush to win a second term, but do not assure his victory.   Kerry meanwhile must win  Minnesota  (10),  Michigan  (17),  Wisconsin  (10) and  Iowa  (7) if he is to have any chance of unseating Bush. Without these 44 combined electoral votes, it will be very difficult for him to win.   It looks like Kerry has the upperhand as we approach the final stretch. Currently there are 34 percent of Americans who say they do not now much about the Democratic candidate. As Kerry introduces himself as viable and acceptable alternative to Bush, you may see swing states turn to safe states, which is exactly what occurred in Pennsylvania -- Kerry is up there by 10 points. Because Bush is already known it is unlikely that any swing states will become safe for him, but they&nbsp;may remain swing states all&nbsp;the way down the stretch.      NOTE:   Blue States  lost more electoral votes than  Red States . Neither gains nor losses were that signifcant --&nbsp;here's the breakdown:&nbsp;    Gained Electoral Votes :  Arizona  (+2); Florida (+2);  Georgia  (+2);  Texas  (+2);  California  (+1);  Colorado  (+1);  Nevada  (+1);  North Carolina  (+1).    Lost Electoral Votes :  New York  (-2);  Pennsylvania  (-2);  Connecticut  (-1);  Indiana  (-1);  Illinois  (-1); Michigan (-1);  Mississippi  (-1); Ohio (-1);  Oklahoma  (-1); Wisconsin (-1).

       urlLink Andrew Sullivan  makes several off-base accusations about Berger and that other scourge of national security, Bill Clinton. There are several mistakes in Sullivan's account that bear examination.   First, I don't agree with Sullivan's accusation that there is any major discrepency between the two characterizations in the NY Times. Berger was accused of stuffing notes in his socks. He did not. He placed some of the notes in his pants and jacket pockets. I don't think most people would describe that act as "stashing material in his clothing".   Secondly, Sullivan mischaracterizes the legality of Berger's actions -- "illegal purloining" as he puts it. However, although Berger's actions went against Arhive policy, they did not violate standing U.S. law.   And as for why he did it. Berger's lawyer provided an answer when he spoke with Wolf Blitzer last night:   "Sandy Berger had been reviewing thousands and thousands of pages of classified documents. He did it so that he could give informed answers to the 9/11 commission. And so the very documents that have formed the basis of their report could be produced. He did that by himself because no one else could do it or would do it. So he has a table. He's working openly. There are Archives people there and there are thousands of documents. And in the course of his review it was clear to everyone he had a leather portfolio. He brought it in openly. The Archives people knew it. And anyone who has works with Sandy knows he always has that leather portfolio and there were lots of business papers that have nothing at all to do with this commission.   "And perhaps, Wolf, there was too much informality by Sandy and maybe too much informality by the Archives people. But at some point when he leaves, the memorandum got caught with his business papers and he walked out. It was inadvertent. He admitted the mistake..."   Now you may not buy this explanation. With the information available at this particular moment it seems to be the most plausible one. If Berger was attempting to rewrite history, as Sullivan suggests, his actions came much to late. The document, authored by Richard Clarke, has been mentioned in several different sources, including several published books. Its contents are well known.  Sullivan predictably blames the mainstream media for their lack of coverage. This simply isn't true. Like most Washington scandals this one is being covered extensively -- CNN has been all over this story.   Finally, Sullivan does not acknowledge the most obvious point: Whoever leaked this story to the press - in an blatant effort to divert attention away from the release of the 9-11 commission findings - has achieved some level of success.

       urlLink The Post  attempts to assess&nbsp;the potential fallout of assuming that most precarious of political labels, the liberal.&nbsp;   Most Democrats today have shied away from the label, allowing Republicans to castigate and excoriate with relative impugnity. The results for Democrats have been disastorous. Just think Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis and&nbsp;George McGovern.&nbsp;Each was&nbsp;branded a liberal by their Republican opponents and each lost the election handily --&nbsp;capturing only 40, 45, 37 percent of the popular vote respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The most successful Democratic candidates for presidency have been those that have eschewed the liberal identity (read Clinton and Gore). Yet forty years ago, a candidate defined the term on his&nbsp;own grounds&nbsp;and embraced it fully. John F. Kennedy faced pointed criticsm&nbsp;that he was a New England liberal&nbsp;when he was vying for the presidency in 1960.&nbsp;He agreed.&nbsp;Four decades later, his&nbsp;response to would-be&nbsp;critics remains definitive and strikingly poignant.    “What do our opponents mean when they apply to us the label ‘Liberal’? If by ‘Liberal’ they mean, as they want people to believe, someone who is soft in his policies abroad, who is against local government, and who is unconcerned with the taxpayer's dollar, then the record of this party and its members demonstrate that we are not that kind of ‘Liberal.’ But if by a ‘Liberal’ they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people -- their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights, and their civil liberties -- someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a ‘Liberal,’ then I'm proud to say I'm a ‘Liberal.’”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  --Sen. John F. Kennedy (1960)   I'm waiting for our current JFK to do the same.

      I know&nbsp;the issue of e-voting&nbsp;has received some attention of late, but there are some very&nbsp;unsettling things I learned&nbsp;about Diebold Inc.,&nbsp;a major manufacturer of the new electronic voting hardware.  &nbsp;  Here are just a few things that I learned&nbsp;from reading various&nbsp;newspaper accounts.  &nbsp;  1. There are few profits to be made in the e-voting business. According to a story in&nbsp; urlLink Bloomberg : "The voting-machine unit was the worst performing of any of Diebold's three divisions last year. Sales of voting machines fell 9.7 percent, the company reported in January. Profit from voting machines dropped 32 percent to $6.4 million. It was the only Diebold unit reporting declines. Diebold has had average annual revenue growth of 31 percent over the past five years."  &nbsp;  2. A significant number of&nbsp;senior executives at Diebold Inc. are&nbsp;staunch&nbsp;supporters of George Bush's reelection effort. Each donated the maximum $2,000 to the 2004 campaign.        Gregory Geswein , Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer     Michael J. Hillock , President, Diebold International      David Bucci, Senior  Vice President, Customer Solutions Group      Thomas Swidarski , Senior Vice President, Strategic Development &amp; Global Marketing      John Michael Crowther , Vice President, Chief Information Officer      Larry Dean Ingram , Vice President, Global Procurement      William Rosenberg , Vice President, Corporate Development      Charles Schuerer , Vice President, Corporate Human Resources &nbsp;  3.&nbsp; In an Aug. 14 letter, Walden O'Dell, chief executive of Diebold Inc. told a group of Ohio Republicans that he was&nbsp;"committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year." The letter, moreover, was received by Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell (R), a day before he qualified Diebold to sell upgraded electronic voting machines throughout the state in time for the 2004 election. (Source:   urlLink Cleveland Plain Dealer , August 28, 2003)  &nbsp;  Now granted, that the chief executive of Diebold Inc.&nbsp;has publicly committed to helping Bush win reelection; that numerous high level executives are loyal Bush contributors; that electronic voting makes little sense financially&nbsp;to the company, doesn't actually prove anything. It just makes me very, very, very uncomfortable.  &nbsp;   Note:  For the more&nbsp;conspirtorially-inclined I would recommend visiting  urlLink BlackBox Voting .

      Sec. of Education Rob Paige, in an attempt to stem criticism of President Bush for skipping the NAACP Convention (for each of the last four years) penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal defending the President's record.  &nbsp;  "In particular, Mr. Bond and Mr. Mfume have done a great disservice to our organization, and to the founders of the civil-rights movement, with their hateful and untruthful rhetoric about Republicans and President Bush. How ironic that they would direct this vitriol at a president who has appointed more African Americans to high-profile posts, has committed more funds to fight AIDS in Africa, has championed minority homeownership, and has supported more trade and aid for African and Caribbean nations than any other administration. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Through his education policies alone, President Bush has done more for the African-American community than any previous president, including the so-called "first black president," Bill Clinton. That's a secret some black leaders may not want millions of African-American voters to know. But just ask the tens of thousands of parents who took advantage of the free choice and tutoring provisions under the first year of NCLB, the majority of whom were minorities. Poll after poll has shown that African-American parents support school choice, which is directly at odds with the NAACP's position on the issue." &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Paige's argument is thoroughly unconvincing. He doesn't back up his assertions&nbsp;with a single shred of evidence. By most accounts the NCLB act is a failure. It punishes failing schools, overemphasizes flawed standardized testings and its punitive measures are extremely counterproductive. I haven't seen any evidence as to how it speficially helps minority students or their families.  &nbsp;  The AIDs initiative is laudable but underfunded.&nbsp;And I'm not sure if the NAACP should give the President points for championing minority homeownership unless&nbsp;it translates into a&nbsp;concrete&nbsp;policy initiative&nbsp;-- talk is cheap. &nbsp;  Paige is unable to offer&nbsp;offer any substantive rebuttal to the claim that Bush has done little for African-American citizens. But I don't fault him for that, because I don't think he could.

      Kevin Drum at  urlLink Washington Monthly  asks the all-important question: How Liberal is John Kerry?   Drum, who like most of us was somewhat surprised to learn that (according to the National Journal) Kerry had a more liberal voting record than that paragon of progressivity Ted Kennedy (D-MA), did a little investigating. He found that a look at the previous NJ rankings, going back to 1999, painted a decidely different picture of Massachusetts' junior Senator.   2003: Kerry - 1st (96.5) Edwards - 4th (94.5)  2002: Kerry - 9th (87.3) Edwards - 31st (63.0) 2001: Kerry - 11th (87.7) Edwards - 35th (68.2)  2000: Kerry - 20th (77) Edwards - 19th (80.8) 1999: Kerry - 16th (80.8) Edwards - 31st (72.2)    Average: Kerry - 12th (85.9) Edwards - 24th (75.7)  "The rankings for 2003 are skewed by the campaign season, and a longer look shows that Kerry is liberal, but hardly a Paul Wellstone liberal, and Edwards is smack in the middle of the Democratic pack."  Makes sense to me and should make sense to any one with sense. Too bad the media hasn't picked up on this yet.

      I think every Democrat should listen to the debate that was held yesterday between Ralph Nader and Howard Dean on  urlLink NPR . Dean was terrific. Unlike Gore who has steadily eroded since 2000, Dean demonstrated that he has both the skill and inclination to shape the future of the Democratic party.  There were a few great moments:  ---------------------------------------------------------------  Moderator:  If you could give Howard Dean one piece of political advice, what would it be?   Nader:  I would tell him to explain to the American people why Howard Dean I’s comments about John Kerry, which were unbelievable searing – makes me look modest by comparison – why they are no longer part of Howard Dean II’s political repertoire.   Moderator:  Gov. Dean what one suggestion would you give Ralph Nader?   Dean:  Lighten up.  Laughter --------------------------------------------------------------- Two things became abundantly clear after listening to these advocates spar. One, Nader is incredibly out of synch. He so desperately wants to be the insurgent candidate that he refuses to recognize the huge ideological gulf that has opened up between the Bush administration and the Democrats. In 2000, you could certainly make the argument that there was little difference between the two candidates. Both Bush and Gore ran as moderates and refused to accentuate the differences between them, even when there were some. Today the differences between John Kerry and George Bush are enormous. Voters may not particularly like either choice, but the they cannot complain about not having a choice. The distinctions between both candidates are stark.

      The  urlLink St. Petersburg Times reports that the Bush campaign might run into problems when assailing trial lawyers in the Sunshine State. Apparently some loyal Republicans belong to this disreputable group.  "Republicans have to tread carefully as many of their own have backgrounds in personal injury and class-action cases. Gov. Jeb Bush, for instance, was quick to cite what he sees as a big difference between a trial attorney like Edwards (who is taking on his brother, the president) and a trial attorney like Floridian Mel Martinez (a fellow Republican running for the U.S. Senate)."  "'Mel Martinez was a successful plaintiff's lawyer, but he's a proven conservative,' the governor said this week."  The hypocrisy makes my head hurt.

      Much has been made of Edwards' lack of foreign policy experience. And Republicans have been repeating the charge ad nauseum. While most news organizations were content to simply parrot this claim,  urlLink the Post  today decides to eschew RNC talking points, providing some much-needed research and analysis. Heaven forbid.  A couple of key grafs...  "In the summer of 2001, when much of the Republican and Democratic policy community was obsessed with missile defense, Edwards urged more attention to terrorism. The North Carolina senator had such limited luck pitching an OpEd article on terrorism to major newspapers that the piece, warning of poor cooperation among federal and local law enforcement, ended up in the weekly Littleton Observer, circulation 2,230 -- four weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks.  "To gain first-hand foreign experience, Edwards toured Israel and Egypt in 2001. As part of a tour to South and Central Asia, Edwards traveled to Afghanistan in 2002 shortly after the U.S.-led war to oust the ruling Taliban and destroy Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda camps. He also visited Britain and twice visited NATO headquarters, in 2002 and 2004. He has met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, campaign aides said.  "Edwards surprised participants in 2002 meetings with European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana and European foreign policy experts, said William Drozdiak, executive director of the Transatlantic Center of the German Marshall Fund who helped organize the Brussels sessions.  "'He was hungry for some foreign policy exposure and experience,' Drozdiak said. 'I was fairly skeptical. I expected a lightweight, but I came away with a favorable impression. He asked a lot of smart questions and actually listened, which is not a noteworthy quality of the Bush people.'"  I guess he has some experience after all.

       urlLink Mother Jones  documents some of the preposterous moments, painful candor, and perfidious achievements of the 108th Congress.  Here are some of the highlights:   Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-Wyo.)  opposed a gun control measure, observing, "One amendment today said we couldn't sell them to anybody under drug treatment. So does that mean if you go into a black community, you cannot sell a gun to any black person?" When the matter of striking her comment from the record came up, Cubin won 227-195, as every Republican voted to support her.   Tom DeLay (R-Texas) , who browbeat a D.C. restaurant manager to let him smoke a cigar at his table. When the manager stood his ground, explaining that because it was a federal building, smoking violated the law of the federal government, DeLay thundered back, "I am the federal government!"   Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.)  offered his Iraq strategy: "Mow the whole place down, see what happens."   Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.)  was on the speakerphone with Majority Leader Bill Frist, unaware that Frist had a reporter in the room. Chambliss explained that a "major Republican donor" wanted an ambassadorship to some overseas organization. "I don't even know what the hell it is," Chambliss said as the reporter transcribed, "but he wants it." Unabashed, Frist asked, "He has a lot of dollar figures down there?" "That's exactly right," Chambliss said, "and he did raise a chunk of money for me." Frist concluded, "All right. You're a good man."   Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska),  according to unnamed sources in The Hill newspaper, "unambiguously" pressured the General Accounting Office's comptroller general into dropping a lawsuit against Dick Cheney for the release of his energy task force's documents by threatening to slash the investigative body's $440 million budget. (Stevens denies intimidating anyone.)   Rep. John Boozman (R-Ark.)  let the domain name boozmanforcongress.com lapse, so that for a while visitors found themselves at a gay porn site featuring "the hottest studs on the Internet."

      The tide has come in, and with it an astounding array of editorials and analyses about John Kerry's VP pick. The Washington Post alone devotes three editorials to the subject, the most interesting by  urlLink E.J. Dionne .   Most articles and editorials contend that the choice was a good one if not the only practical one. The best argument yet offered is by  urlLink William Saletan  of Slate. But there are some exceptions: see the  urlLink LA Times .  "Five months ago, after watching Kerry strut his stuff in New Hampshire—such as it was—I warned that Democrats were on the verge of nominating a guy who had plenty of selling points but couldn't make the sale himself.  "So this was the dilemma: Edwards was the best salesman, but Kerry was the best product. If you had to choose one or the other, I thought it was more important to pick the salesman, since the consequences of losing the election were far more serious than the consequences of electing the less qualified Democrat. The logic made sense, but the premise was mistaken. Democrats didn't have to choose. They could get the best product along with the best salesman, if Kerry had the wisdom to pick Edwards.  "That's where wisdom had to intervene. Kerry had to recognize that the decision wasn't strictly his to make. Look again at those exit polls. Most Democrats who voted for Kerry weren't in love with him. They saw him as a vehicle to get rid of Bush. Some initially preferred the candidate who vowed to stand up to Bush, or the candidate who preached optimism, or the candidate who accused Republicans of a war against working people, or the candidate who promised to take back our government from the special interests. Kerry absorbed all the votes by absorbing all the messages. He became the optimistic guy who would stand up against Bush's war on work and fight the special interests. More clearly than any Democratic presidential nominee in 20 years, Kerry was chosen not to represent himself but to represent his party. And what Democrats wanted, as polls and crowds made clear, was Edwards—because they like him, and because they want to win.  "That's the most important thing Kerry revealed today: He understands that the election is about more than what he wants. Sometimes the biggest thing you can do is to accept what's bigger than you."

      Get ready to be inundated with stories about John Kerry's VP pick, John Edwards. Although, Edwards was an odds on favorite since his impressive bid for the nomination, some news outlets were caught slightly   urlLink off guard  by Kerry's choice. CNN and FOX are rejurgitating Republican talking points, but have little substantive to offer on the subject. In fact, nothing out there yet is probably worth the ink or the cyberspace with which it was composed.  We may have to wait a little while for any stories that are truly worth reading -- longer if newsoutlets continue to rely on campaign spin in their reporting.

      This guy is really losing it. The Nader campaign in Philadelphia recruited homeless people to collect signatures by promising to pay them for every signature collected. The campaign then refused to pay them.  From the  urlLink Philadelphia Inquirer :  "Petition circulators were told they would be paid from 75 cents to $1 for each valid signature. Half of the money was to be delivered at the end of the day and the balance paid by check the following Wednesday.  "But people who showed up Wednesday described a chaotic situation. Lines moved slowly as Slevin and one assistant, protected by armed guards, vetted the petitions for obviously forged signatures. Many in line were shouting and claiming they had been underpaid. As tensions grew, police were called.  "By day's end, many left without being paid. Those who returned the next day found the office empty."

      Larry Johnson, a former counter-terrorism official at the CIA and former deputy director of counter terrorism at the State Department, doesn't think much of the recent terror warning. Speaking on  urlLink NPR  this morning he characterized the alert as a "gross overreaction" by the Dept. of Homeland Security.    "I think it’s irresponsible on the part of Homeland Security and I'll tell you why. This was provoked by the recovery of documents… by arresting individuals in Pakistan. What has been recovered are surveillance or targeting documents indicating that at some point in the past these elements of al Qaeda had developed target studies of buildings. What is lacking in this is an indication that not only had they developed a targeting study but they had moved it forward from a targeting study to actually implementing that study. And the impression that is left with the American people that they are poised to launch these attacks and I don’t believe that is the case."  Johnson argues that there is a clear distinction between desire and capability.    “The fact that they would like to do that doesn’t translate into actual capability of being able to do that. I think unfortunately, the impression left with the American people is that these groups are poised to do this.”

      I got in an argument with a friend of mine the other day about the minimum wage. While driving back from a Baltimore Orioles game, she attempted to lecture me about how raising the minimum wage would devestate low-income earners. Her argument (and a common refrain from conservatives): Raising the minimum wage would destroy many low-income job opportunties, ergo hurting the very people that the hike purportedly helps.  This is perhaps the strongest argument against raising the minimum wage. It's a well-established economic theory, embraced by economists across the ideological spectrum. Even Robert Reich, former U.S. Labor Secretary and champion of the underserved, concedes the validity of this principle.   Yet this argument is also decidely weak if we look at the evidence. The econonmoy is affected by so many countervailing forces that it is impossible to isolate any one variable. Yes, everything else being exactly equal, raising the minimum wage would probably reduce a certain number of minimum-wage jobs, as employers can afford to employ less people. But like so many other economic theories, practical application has not helped affirm it.   Under President Clinton the minimum wage was increased from $4.35 to $5.15, where it stands today. Clinton also presided over the greatest expansion of jobs in the nation's history - roughly 23 million jobs in eight years.  Here are a few other reasons to support an increase in the minimum wage:  Fully 80 percent of the American people believe in raising the minimum wage.   Nearly 2/3 of minimum wage workers are women, many of whom are also mothers.   Most minimum wage jobs do not provide retirement benefits, and few provide health care. These become immediate out of pocket expenses for minimum wage workers, and for most prohibitively expensive.  Even companies that offer benefits often avoid providing them by hiring more part-time employees, thereby reducing the number of workers who are eligible to receive them.  If we are serious about moving people off welfare rolls and lifting them out of poverty, then we have to provide jobs that pay enough. This country has always valued our strong work ethic - Americans are some of the hardest working citizens in the world. In order to stay true to this core belief we should reward those who work.
