      I'm no longer going to take the World History Sat II--I just don't feel confident that I can make it into that 650-700 score range and anything less will be a blemish on my academic track.  This is not the huge news I mentioned below,  that  news is postive news.  Furthermore, I might buy myself the study book for Literature SAT II (which i signed up for but later figured I'd decline since mostly Juniors take it) and maybe peruse through it and take a diagnostic test.  If I'm not some kind of a guru at it, I won't take it either--If I am I will take it instead of the World History SAT II.

      I've got a huge story to tell later when I get home from Chemistry tutoring at school.  It's massively unbelievable, incredible, unthinkable, extroardinary, superb, ahhhh enough words.  I'll tell it later.  And no I didn't find a girlfriend :(  It's far too hard to find a decent girl...

      So today I presented my speech for the junior class presidency and it was a huge success.  I got massive amounts of cheers and it took a lot of effort to quiet the class down.  It was such a success that I felt bad for the other candidates.   Then at the end of the day, I was inducted into the ARISTA National Honor Society, along with about 20 other kids.  We had to dress up for it and I felt pretty spiffy.  My mom came to see it.  That was nice. I've been invited to Columbia University tomorrow for Leadership Day.  I have to dress up for that too.  I'm missing the whole day and it makes me anxious because I don't want to miss any work.  Sure I'm an A student, but I dunno I guess I'm just being overly anxious.  Since I'm missing the whole day tomorrow I didn't crack open any books.  Instead I hung around my desk talking to people--wasting my time.  The only productive thing I did this afternoon was the desktop in the entry above this one.  I think it's the best I've ever made.  Anyways, I'm feeling pretty crappy right now.  I could have been studying for my SAT II or reading Hemingway but instead I pissed away my afternoon.  Maybe I'm too hard on myself, maybe I'm an idiot, who knows.  I think I'm gonna go to sleep now though.  When you're in a shitty mood, you want people to care but then you don't want them to approach you either.  So I guess I want to be left alone.

      I'm sitting at my desk and it's 10:08 p.m.  I finished all my homework a couple of hours ago and I want to study for my SAT IIs and I want to excercise but I'm just so dead right now it's not even funny.  I just want to sit here and rot, talking to friends on AIM.  Tomorrow I'm gonna get back in the game though.  I can't afford to fuck around like this.  My mentor asked me an interesting question today.  He asked me why I was different from other kids when it came to academics and work ethic.  I was completely unable to answer him.  All I know is that when I don't feel like I'm the best at something or that I'm not giving something my complete effort, I dwell on it and never let myself forget it.  Other than that, the "why" is missing.

      I've completed the transfer of most of my old blogs to this new blog.  I plan on using this one from now on.  Note: of course, all those past blogs are not accurately dated so I guess you have to use your imagination.  I've chugged through most of my World History SAT II book with a trusty highlighter over this past weekend and now I only have 83 pages of review left to read through.  Once I'm done with that I'm gonna keep reading it over, taking notes, and reading it over some more until it sticks--all up until June 4th, the day before I take my test.    In other news, Mr. Austin urged me to join ARISTA, which is A. Philip Randolph's chapter of the National Students Honor Society.  I turned in my application today and he said I'd get the invitation to the ceremony soon.  Then I asked him if you had to have been accepted to the get that invitation and he said yes but that wasn't going to be a problem for me at all.  That made me feel good.  When I picked up my recommendation from my English teacher for ARISTA today she squeezed my forearm and smiled.  It was so nice of her, I don't know.  I guess I felt touched because I hated her so much at the beginning of the year but I've come to appreciate her and respect her greatly as of late.  Not to mention, that definitely meant she gave me an insane recommendation.  Class elections are on Wednesday I believe.  The first draft of my speech is finished but it needs some additions, and I need some more info to put into it.  I'm feeling confident.  Now I'm gonna head on down to the living room now and do some SAT review.  Godd I'm such a loser..

      Ok, regarding my meditation--I am yet to successfully wake up at 5:00 am.  I wake up to the alarm but thus far have infallibly went right back to bed for that extra hour.  I try every morning though, eventually I'll make it.   I finished Slaughter-house Five last week.  It was very very good and interesting.  I started The Great Gatsby last weekend and I'm about half-way through.  I don't like it as much as Slaughter-house but it's enjoyable.  I also bought the first of two SAT II Review books that I need for my two SAT II's on June 5th.  I got the World History review book and I'm probably going to take the diagnostic practice test tomorrow.  Wish me luck.  The next book on the list is The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway.  I've also got about three side books I'm reading, which are The Portable Oscar Wilde (if you don't know who he is, look him up, he was a genius), The Other House by Henry James, and The Turn of The Screw, also by Henry James.  I'm reading SO much lately, it's a little frightening.  Tomorrow, I'm going to head on down to the pool and do some training to size my swimming up to see where I stand since soon enough I'll be taking a lifeguard test which I have to pass, otherwise, no cash this summer. If all that crap isn't enough, I really want to speed up work on my short story, I'm stuck at a pitiful two pages...so so busy.  Some good news for a change is that my GPA is safe, math and music went down but french, history and english are up enough to cover that and maybe even  raise  the GPA.

      Well I didn't get a chance to take my practice diagnostic World History test today because I spent my afternoon at the pool training for the lifeguard test.  I'd love to be a lifeguard because everyone tells me it's an awesome experience, and it pays 10 dollars an hour. (I piss my pants every time I say that) During the first 45 minutes, I was a wreck--nauseous, dizzy, cramps, sore, and feeling sorry for myself.  Then I got back into the water after a rest and started perfecting my technique.  I've been trying to become a smart swimmer, it's all about your technique and condition.  So after I got used to the swimming and the feel of it all, I was doing laps and all.  So, in short, passing the lifeguard test is a longshot, but I may pass it.  I'll have to see how I progress in the coming weeks.  I'm not counting on it though, which is why I'm securing my back-up job with Summer Youth tomorrow.  It pays less, a lot less, but what are you gonna do?  I'm going to take my diagnostic test tomorrow right when I get home from school, then head on down to the pool.

      I've decided to lead a boycott against all fast food. If you would like to join the boycott, email me at angelrendon@optonline.net with your first and last name and I will add you to the list. The world has to know that there are people out there who are not going to take this shit. In the future, there will be a site dedicated to this boycott.  My second update has to do with J.D. Salinger. (The guy who wrote The Catcher in The Rye among other great things) I've been reading some more of his writing and doing some research on him and I've decided to write him a letter. He is a popular subject of fan mail because he is such a social hermit and he is such a genius at the same time.  Here is a man who could be enjoying so much fame and influence, yet he isolates himself for his own very personal reasons.  I can't help but be ultimately intrigued by his insight, life, and work.  I am going to write him a letter expressing my appreciation for his talent, and his work.  He's been known to write people back if approached politely and if he writes me back, mark my words, the letter will be framed and kept on my wall until the day I die.  That is how highly I regard Salinger.  So, here's hoping I get a reply.  I'm probably going to have my letter ready by some time next week.

      "Oh my god Amy, look at this," Emily remarked with a wide smirk. 	"Gosh! That is  so ghetto ," Amy confirmed after meandering over. They were staring across the platform of the 149th St. & Grand Concourse subway station at a pile of debris on the abandoned platform.  The uptown track of the 2 and 5 train line was out of service for a lengthy strip of track--beginning at 149th St.  Amy and Emily continued to point and laugh loudly and extravagantly.  They had met at mandatory workplace sensitivity training and instantly hit it off.  Life growing up on the upper west side had not intersected their paths until two weeks ago.  Emily revealed a camera from within her handbag and poised it before her right eye.  She proclaimed, "I have got to take a picture of this," causing Amy to let out louder fits of laughter.  They had just left a Yankees game.  The stadium, which stood proudly on 161st St. & Grand Concourse was just about the only feature of the South Bronx capable of attracting white people.   	"Emily!  I just had a  classic  idea! I'm going to pay this bum to pose with you in front of all that shit," Amy shouted.   	Emily was up for it; she replied with an affirmed, "Let's do it!" 	After approaching the homeless man with her offer, he accepted her crisp five dollar bill and slumped beside Emily for the photograph.  "Ugh! He smells," Emily sneered with a beaming grin on her face.  The homeless man did not smile, and neither did anyone else on the platform.

      Here are some powerful quotes from Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser:  "Americans now spend more money on fast food than on higher education, personal computers, computer software, or new cars.  They spend more on fast food than movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos, and recorded music--combined."  "The idea that you are what you eat had been enthusiastically promoted for years by Den Fujita, the eccentric billionaire who brought McDonald's to Japan three decades ago.  'If we eat McDonald's hamburgers and potatoes for a thousand years,' Fujita once promised his countrymen, "We will become taller, our skin will become white, and our hair will be blonde.'"  "The real power of the American consumer has not yet been unleashed.  The heads of Burger King, KFC, and McDonald's...they're outnumbered...A good boycott, a refusal to buy, can speak much louder than words.   Pull open the glass door, feel the rush of cool air, walk inside, get in line, and look around you, look at the kids working in the kitchen, at the customers in their seats, at the ads for the latest toys, study the backlit color photographs above the counter, think about where the food came from, about how and where it was made, about what is set in motion by every single fast food purchase, the ripple effect near and far, think about it.  Then place your order.  Or turn around and walk out the door.  It's not too late.  Even in this fast food nation, you can still have it your way."

      I'm very sorry that I haven't been updating more frequently but I've been in such a bad routine.  I'm nearing the end of midterm week at school and I've just been really lazy and horribly motivated.  All I've been doing is procrastinating online and talking to friends all afternoon.  Next week, I'm getting back on track though.  It hasn't really been much of a problem though, I'm acing my french, history, and english midterms.  Getting a B most likely on Chemistry, definitely getting a B on the Music Appreciation midterm, and we'll see about math, hopefully I can ace it.  I may not because I ran out of room doing a problem the wrong way so I did it over on a seperate piece of paper and when I handed it in my teacher said she wouldn't accept it.  She hates me so much and she's so unprofessional.  But what are you gonna do?  You're not gonna find private school teachers at a public school.  On a lighter note, another one of the reasons I haven't had time for traditional school work and blogging and such is that I have really kicked my reading into overdrive.  I bought Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser and Nine Stories by J.D. Salinger.  I finished Fast Food Nation yesterday, and started Nine Short Stories..yesterday, haha.  Fast Food Nation was fantastic.  I have never seen such a superb slab of journalism work.  Reading that book was enlightening and even empowering in so many ways.  I have been a vegetarian for almost a year and a half now, initially starting out to see what it was like, not really concerned with the values commonly associated with vegetarianism, however, recently I have really become very opinionated on concerning my lifestyle.    Here is my message to all of my readers: Stop eating all fast food.  The effects of this industry have raped our land, our cities, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and affects all of our lives every day in unimaginable ways.  Please, if you care about yourself, or this world population, read this book and boycott fast food.  Perhaps in an entry down the road I'll really get on a rant about the real facts on fast food, but not today.

      Today, I was called down to the college office during 4th period for a meeting with about 6 other kids--all juniors no other sophomores about meeting a Harvard representative who is visiting the school tomorrow.  Then the woman conducting the meeting told me that when he contacted the school, he asked specifically to speak to me, and then she gave him the names of the other kids (the juniors) and they're participating too.  I suppose it's pretty insignificant but it definitely feels great that people are noticing my hardwork, especially people from top educational institutions.

      The problems associated with consuming milk and other dairy products are basically divided into two parts--the first being the animal cruelty and the second being the factors affecting our health.   First, I'll discuss the animal cruelty and harsh conditions that our cows live through on factory-farms.  Female cows are first artificially inseminated right after their first birthdays.  Cows customarily lactate (produce milk) for ten months after birthing.  After these ten months are through, the cows are artificially inseminated again, in a cycle which ends once a cow is about 4 or 5 years old, at which point they are sent to the slaughter house to feed our nation's need for beef.  The lifespan of a cow is 25 years, with 9 of these years maintaining the ability to produce milk.  However, cows at factory-farms never reach this 9th year due to the conditions, which lead to disease, lameness, and reproductive problems that render te cows worthless to the dairy industry.  What happens to the calves?  The calves are taken from their mother's after only 1 day and are fed "milk-replacers", which include cattle blood so that we can take the milk instead of the calves.  How about some statistics?  There are approximately 9 million ows living on farms in the U.S. today, compared to 22 million in 1950.  In contrast to those figures, where 116 billion pounds of milk were produced nationwide in 1950, 170 million pounds of milk are produced nationwide every year today.  How is this possible?  Well, as a result of genetic manipulation, antibiotics, and hormones, instead of an average cow producing approximately 16 pounds of milk per day, your average cow presently produces 50 pounds of milk per day--not to mention the high-protein diets fed to cows, which consist of dead chickens, pigs, and other farm animals, because a measly diet of grass would not provide the nutrients necessary to produce such abnorminally large amounts of milk.   Want to learn something new?  There's a major problem amongst cow herds throughout the nation.  It's called mastitis.  It is a painful inflammation of the mammary glands.  It can be caused by about 150 different types of bacteria, including E. coli.  The method of detecting the infection is by inspecting the somatic cell count (SCC).  Somatic cells are white blood cells and skin cells that line the inside of a cow's udder.  For normal milk, the SCC is below 100,000 cells per milliliter.  However, factory-farms have found a loophole in the system to feed America bad milk.  They are allowed to combine milk from several cows in a herd into what is called a "bulk tank" somatic cell count.  In other words, they combine a lot of milk, some good milk, some bad milk, and they manage to stay within a so-called healthy level of milk with a BTSCC (bulk-tant somatic cell count) of 750,000 cells per milliliter.  A BTSCC of 700,000 or more indicated that 2/3's of the herd are infected.  It has been proven that housing cows in cleaner environments with more space, and better diets, and care lowers the SCC count of thier milk and thier incidence of masitis.   Like veal?  Where female calves are either slughtered or made into milk-makers, male calves are raised for veal.  Thy are chained in tiny stalls for about 18 weeks and are fed a milk substitute designed to make them gain 2 pounds per day.  Their diet is low in iron on purpose to induce anemia and maintain their flesh a pale color.  Calves being raised for veal normally suffer from diarrhea, pneumonia, and lameness.  And now for the factors concerning our health.  We are the only species that drinks milk beyond infancy, furthermore, we are also the only species that drinks  another species' milk.  Cow's milk is meant for calves, human infants don't have 4 stomachs and don't customarily gain hundred's of pounds in a matter of months after birth.  Cow's milk also contains three times as much protein as human milk.  Humans begin producing less and less lactase (the enzyme that helps to digest milk) after the age of 2.  Millions of Americans are lactose-intolerant, as well as 75% of Native and African-Americans and 90% of Asian-Americans.   They are two major myths associated with milk, one involves calcium and the other involves protein.  American women consume whopping amounts of calcium, yet the rates of osteoperosis amongst American women are of the highest in the world.  On the other hand, Chinese woman, who consume about half that amount of protein, and this consumption is mostly from plant-sources, have a miniscule incidence of osteoperosis.  "A Harvard Nurses’ Study of more than 77,000 women aged 34 to 59 found that those who consumed two or more glasses of milk per day had higher risks of broken hips and arms than those who drank one glass or less per day." (PETA, 2003)  "T. Colin Campbell, professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University, said, 'The association between the intake of animal protein and fracture rates appears to be as strong as that between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.'"  Protein deficiency is hardly a problem at all in the U.S.  It is only an issue in famine-stricken countries.  The excessive intake of protein from dairy, eggs, and meat is linked to kidney stones and is associated with cancer of the colon and liver.    The answer?  Drink soy-milk, and eat soy-products.  It has all the calcium you need along with vitamins, iron, zinc, and protein, and without the cholesterol!  Vegetarianism and veganism means the protection of your life and that of animals.  (Paraphrasing based on PETA's website.  www.peta.org)

      He Only Stumbled  The once placid movie line erupted into a commotion in a single second. The boy was with his mother, father, and sister, who was a little older.   They were waiting on a line to get into the theatre to buy tickets to a movie.  The theatre was at the bottom floor of a building on the grounds of the outdoor mall at 161st street and Grand Concourse.  The movie line extended from the glass doors leading into the theatre to the escalators that led the up to the food court.  Right across from the theatre doors were a set of double doors that led to a back entrance into the building.  People used this space to appease their cigarette cravings.  The stranger had stood there for about ten minutes, smoking a cigarette in the doorway, watching the people walk by.  He was six feet tall and portly.  He had a slouch about him that accentuated the size of his back.  He was wearing a hat that looked like something a fly fisher would wear, the type that fit snug on the top of your head and had a ruffled brim all around.  He also had a long coat on.  His protruding waist didn’t allow the coat to fit very well along his thighs; instead it hung loosely at the bottom.  He started walking over to the line.  The mother of the two children was talking to the father about what movie she wanted to see.  He wasn’t facing her; he was watching an attractive younger woman walk by seductively.  Suddenly, the overweight stranger came dashing from behind and smothered the child with his momentum.  The mother shouted, “Oh my God!”   The father aggressively leapt into action, he pulled the stranger off and pressed him against the wall.  The father was noticeably smaller than the stranger, but despite his size, his ferocious aggression seemed to overpower the meek stranger.  It was clear now that both parents thought that the stranger had made an attempt to attack or even abduct their son.  “I tripped, I swear, I tripped,” the stranger attempted to reason with the father.   He was very embarrassed.  The father’s grip on the strangers gray coat sagged.  “Fuck man, what the fuck…” he said, as he let him go.   	The child started to cry.  “Look motherfucker, you have to watch where you fuckin’ go, you piece of shit,” the father shouted. 	The mother tugged on her husband’s arm, and he slowly started to back away.  The stranger slouched away from the wall that he was being pressed against.  “I tripped on the hole in the tiling of the floor, I swear.”  The stranger apologized, “I’m sorry, I really am.”  His face was old.  The wrinkles looked like those of a man that had lived a lengthy life.  The daughter had been silent the entire time, she was just watching, wide-eyed, with her mouth gaping open.  The entire movie line had gathered around now.  All of their eyes were on the stranger.   	“Here, you alright, little man?”  The stranger stepped forward to make sure the boy wasn’t hurt, but the mother didn’t indulge him; she hugged her child and turned her back to the stranger, protectively. 	“Why don’t you just fuckin' get lost,” the father suggested, almost like a threat.  The crowd grew silent, except for the boy’s sobbing.  Then, the stranger, with beads of sweat rolling down his forehead slowly put his hands in his coat pockets, turned away, and walked out the back door.  The mother continued to console her child.  The father looked off down the hallway saying, “He’ll be alright; he’s a guy.  No big deal.”

      Ok today was the awards ceremony for the HPREP program, essentially the day where we all get our certificates of completion of the program, and when the best research paper is announced.  I found out early on when they were outlining the schedule for the ceremony that the prize for the winner of best paper wasn't in fact a full scholarship but a book scholarship--a few thousand dolars for books for college.  I was a little disappointed at that but I was still hoping for a win, I knew I had a good chance but I was just afraid that I wouldn't make the cut for some reason or another.  Well after a few speeches, the certificates were handed out, we were called up by name and as I accepted my certificate, one of the program coordinators shook my hand and said, "You had an awesome paper."  After that I knew I was definitely in for at least 3rd place.  After all the certificates were handed out, he honorable mentions were announced.  There were two of them and I willed myself not to be one of them.  I hate nothing more in life than being in 2nd or 3rd place.  I was in the clear after the two honorable mentions and waited eagerly to hear my name.   "And the winner of our 2004 book scholarship for surpassing all possible expectations of what a research paper is supposed to be, Anghel Rendon [they pronounced my name the spanish way]!"     I was on such a high, I didn't even smile, I went down and played it reeeaaal cool.  I felt so awesome.  The best part of all though, was that everyone got dressed up for the ceremony--dresses, suits, women's suits, ties, the works.  Me, I came in my most torn up old ass hand-me-down jeans, with rips and tears all over the place.  And a t-shirt that belonged to my oldest brother when he was my age. [He's 22 now]  I felt like such a careless, really smart rockstar.  The most annoying member of the program was this really prissy, over achiever type girl, and she was all dressed up, and her mom was sitting behind her with a bouquet of flowers--she didn't even get an honorable mention!  I thought she was my biggest competition for the win!  I am really feeling good about myself.  Not to mention, one of the two honorable mentions went to a kid that also goes to my school!  Email me if you want to read my winning research paper--not that ANYONE is gonna take me up on that--I just didn't feel like I was finished tooting my own horn, haha.  angelrendon@optonline.net

      Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of The Christ, has been taking a lot of heat lately.  Many people just don't like the depiction of Jewish people in this film.  Having seen it, yes it's true; although they are not depicted as blood thirsty animals and such, the jewish leaders are conveyed as ruthless and malicious.  However, I recommend this film to everyone for a number of reasons.  It has a wealth of theoligic information and it's an interesting thing to watch played out in someone else's point of view.  The cinematography is  superb .  Honestly, I would be hard pressed to see a film with better angles, lighting, scenery, it was all just fabulous.  And the last reason is, this is one of the best stories ever told.  I think that fact is often overlooked as people get up to defend their respective religions.  The New Testament is one of the most amazing stories ever told.    Now, the main problem with the film.  But before that can be discussed, the film's title and how it pertains to the film must be appreciated.  The film is meant to depict the passion, the force, the will, the love that was required for Christ to lay down his own life to be taken in such a brutal way.  Remember, it is reiterated in the Gospels that no one had any power over Christ that wasn't given to them by Him--something to remember when you truly stop to think about what Jewish people are actually considered responsible for.  Having explained that, one of the biggest problems with the film is it's gory expression of Christ's torture and crucifixion.  The scenes of torture are relentless, as well as the scenes where Christ carries his cross.  In my opinion, the scenes in the film that truly made me feel the passion of Christ were the delicately filmed flashbacks, showing Jesus teaching, or Him at home with his mother, Mary.  It was sorely unncecessary to film every blow along with it's contacts on His body.  In my opinion, that is the main problem with the film.  Some people will complain about the controversy over the Jews however any intelligent person can understand the fact that according to the Gospels, no one had power over Jesus that Jesus did not give them.  Secondly, it was meant to be for Jesus to perish for the sins of others.  It was not some issue that if Jewish people hadn't been around, we would still have our savior--the whole method of His saving us was by way of His death.  I could sit here and argue this for a long time, but I think I've made my point.  Watch the film, it's an interesting one to say in the least.  I close with a line from the film:  "You are my friends, and the greatest love a person can have for his friends is to give his life for them."

      I have no idea at all what's missing in my life but it's missing big time.  I lean towards a girlfriend as the missing link but what if that's not it.  I don't know, some days, it just feels like I'm trying to fill an insatiable void.  Life feels like me running around trying to wipe off all the Fuck You's from my walls, but they never come off, it's hopeless, and the tragedy is that I can't stop trying to wipe them off.  Ten points to who gets my metaphor.  edit: Someone rescue me tonight, I feel like I'm going to snap.

      "Don't you ever just want to look at a stranger's face?  There is something utterly revealing about a person's facial expression.  It's especially captivating if you watch someone engaged in a conversation.  You can almost see the thoughts bouncing around the inside of their mind.  I like to watch people's eyes--but only when they're not looking at mine.  When you watch someone's eyes, it's like you're on some rooftop, watching the person go about their day.  Or it's like following someone, and being so close you can feel their heartbeat, and keeping so quiet that they don't notice.  It only lasts until they look up at you and your eyes lock witht theirs for a moment lasting longer than words can express--because it's a different kind of time, one that can't be measured by number or word, only by thought.  Then you look down, embarassed."  Straight out my black book, comment.

      I'm in this program called HPREP that Cornell's Medical School hosts, and it's for aspiring medical students or kids who are interested in the field.  Anyways, we basically just go to HPREP every Friday after school, listen to a speaker, work on our research papers, and then go home, but last Friday, we got to do the most awesome thing ever.    They took us down to the basement lab as a surprise and we got to examine the cadavers!  It was literally, one of the most amazing moments in my life.  I held a human heart in the palms of my hands!  Not very many people get to do that at all!  My group had this massive overweight guy--not obese, but he was a big guy.  This guy must have had the  worst  diet ever.  His thoracic and abdominal cavities had already been opened and the inside of his skin was lined with a 1 inch thick layer of fat!  We saw the med student pull out his intestines, his stomach, his liver---all that awesome stuff.  The heart and lungs were the only organs that had been removed, they were removed for us to examine more closely.  This guy's heart, was three times the normal size because of his lifestyle, in fact that's what probably caused his death.  As your heart grows in size because of an unhealthy lifestyle, the muscles responsible for pumping blood don't grow at all, so it becomes increasingly hard to pump blood efficiently.  So this guy probably died of heart failure.  I was also examining his lungs, and I was holding the left one, when I turned it over and saw a red piece of glass lodged in his lung.  I walked over to one of the Med students and asked him why there was glass in his lung and he said, "Nah man, that's a blood clot."  A blood clot!!!    Another interesting note was that all the cadavers were headless, because the 1st year med students study the anatomy  and physiology of the body, while the 2nd year med students focus on the brain.  Man it was so awesome.  It was such an amazing feeling to experience our mortality in such a realistic way.  I'm really honored to have had an experience like that, that most kids or anyone else for that matter don't have a chance to have.

      Well school is always a pleasure, it's funny, the people are nice, and the work is easy.  After school, there was a Kaplan meeting for all of us mentees and our mentors.  This night was the annual game night where we play games with eachother--but my mentor and I just sat off to the side and discussed Moby Dick, my writing, and his writing.  It was cool.   I also got to catch up with Jessica, the girl I was crushin on for a little a couple months ago, but I realized she's not really girlfriend material for me.  She's in the Kaplan program too, so we talked a lot on the way over and before our mentor's came.  That's all for now, next entry is this funny ass story that Dan told me about his trip to this Science Conference in Seattle.  You thought I forgot to post it, didn't you Dan!!

      "I had this brilliant idea today while I was walking around naked.  Have you ever walked around naked?  It's not easy, even though we've all done it before.  When I walk naked, I can't feel the cold.  The best part about it is the other people.  The thing is, you can see  them  naked too.  But you have to look them in the eye.  It's hard doing what I do.  I do it every Friday from 7:15 to 7:30.  I can only do it on the east side, where it's quiet.  I walk real slow--real cool, like I know something that no one else knows.  And I'm beautiful, and dangerous.  It's easy to snap out of it too.  You can't smile, you can't think about anything.  You have to feel yourself, watch yourself.  Think about that.  No one else can see you naked, unless they're naked too.  My eyes are halfway filled with tears.  That's what happens when you walk around town naked.  When you feel yourself, you want to cry.  You can see the tears welling in everyone else's eyes too.  I don't do it 'cause I want to, I do it 'cause I have to.  It's like looking at your eyes in the mirror, and suddenly becoming so aware of yourself that you get scared.  Don't be scared, the bridge is creaking under your weight, but you haven't fallen.  Appearances are transparent; you are beautiful, and dangerous too."  That literally poured out of my brain and onto paper on a train ride home tonight, I think it is really good.

      I had a good time.  It was so funny.  Manny kept cracking the most obnoxious jokes and I kept making this 19 or 20 year old cute woman on the train laugh.  Her and her friend talked to me a little, asked how old I was, if I was a virgin--it was pretty hot.  I lied and told em I was 17 though--not much of a lie since I'm 16, 17 just sounds better.  There was also this hot mentor at Kaplan who was running a resume workshop.  I definitely have a big big thing for older women...yikes.  It's probably for the best that incredible fantasies never happen in real life (especially not to someone as relatively unlucky as me) since it's illegal and all.  Although, I'm perfectly fine with chicks my own age.  Ladies, I'm elligible and willing :/---not that anyone would ever care..  Time for homework.   Leave me comments!

      I have t go to school this morning...oh well, it should be ok I guess.  I've been thinking  WAY  too much lately, and it's been putting me in a weird mood.  School will help me take my mind off things.  I'm not looking forward to my report card, I probably barely got away with my A average this marking period.  I really want to apply myself more.

      I only have one really really close friend and that's Dan but I'm also pretty close with Emily and I've realized...that most of my friends don't really know much at all about me.  About my life at home, my childhood, my brothers...and Dan knows very well that a lot of this stuff has shaped the person I am.  I don't understand it really.  The only thing I can come up with is that I avoid talking about myself but on the same token, I find relationships with people that much more rewarding when all my cards are on the table.  It's an odd thing.  I asked Emily last night if she agreed with the fact that I know a lot more than she does about me and as I suspected she strongly agreed.  So we spent the rest of the conversation talking about me.  It's a weird thing to feel like someone you're relatively close with doesn't know much about you....

      I learned a lot about Hinduism today.  It is a fascinating religion.  Here's some background info.  It is the world's oldest religion.  Hindus worship several gods, which represent different forms of the most divine spirit of the Hindu religion,  Brahman .  Hinduism, like Buddhism, stresses that people reach true enlightenment only by detachment from earthly desires.  Gurus, or spritual teachers play a major role in spreading Hindu beliefs--they interpret and provide insight into the religion.  The Vedas are the oldest Hindu scriptures--they contain prayers, hymns, and works of philosophy.   Brahma ,  Vishnu , and  Shiva  are the three main gods of the Hindu religion.  Vishnu is the preserver of the universe, whereas Shiva is its destroyer.  They say that the best way to learn something is to teach it, so here I am I guess.

      I just woke up and I officially feel like hammered shit.  I need to get some breakfast.  The week is almost over and I don't have to go to gym today because I'm emergency tutoring a kid who is literally gonna fail his math finals.  This kid is such an idiot though.  I seriously cannot help him, he's gonna fail.  I asked him what negative four plus positive four was and he said eight!  Oh well, at least I don't have to get changed.  Next week, I have no school so it's gonna be relaxing.  My birthday's on Tuesday!  The big sixteen!  Five more days!   Countdown to Birthday: 5 Days

      I haven't been focusing lately.  I can always do well with my schoolwork because it's so easy for me, but, there's a difference between doing well and doing  very  well.  I can notice that difference, and if I can notice it, my teachers can too.  I am just such an amazing procrastinator.  I find myself just hanging around the tv all day or just being on the internet all night.  I don't want to work so hard to the point that it sucks up my life like some kids, I just want to feel like I'm  doing  my work.  So today, I'm gonna start working hard again.

      My friend Dan came over today.  I live in the Bronx in a neighborhood where basically no white people live in, unless they're poor white people.  Other than that it's all Blacks and Hispanics.  He happens to be white and most people weren't very polite to him on his way to my house from the train.  He was called a cracker twice and a white bitch once.  You know, we tend to complain a lot about white opression seeing as it is often times difficult to grow up and be successful as a minority, but what makes us better if we jeer at and make another person uncomfortable just because of the color of their skin.  We all need to take a step back and learn how to live with one another.  This kid is not a racist, nor would I befriend a racist.  But he was insulted anyway.

      I am really digging this new blog, it's way nicer than my old xanga one....and it's free!  I was talking to my therapist about this thing that happenned last week or so in English class.  We had a creative writing assignment for homework to write about what our memories of this time in our lives would be, ten years from now.  And I wrote some stupid thing, I couldn't really think of anything.  So this girl stands up to read hers in front of the class.  Her name is Asia, and she talks to me a lot, some guy named Dante told me she liked me but Asia never came out and said it.  Anyways, I'm looking down at my desk reading something, not paying much attention when I look up a few minutes into her reading and everyone in the class is looking back at me.  Then Manny (another kid in the class) whispers, "She's reading about you."  I immediately started to listen and she said all kinds of things about me being unique, and intelligent, and not caring what people think about me, and about how she loves talking to me to listen to all the great things I have to say.  Needless to say, I was mortified.  I never brought it up with Asia for two reasons, it made me extremely uncomfortable, and I figured it would make her feel uncomfortable too.  I felt like a jerk either way.  Michael (my therapist) says, "You have to learn how to accept flowers."  He was alluding to a metaphorical story that he had just told me about the first time a girl gave him flowers.  That made me feel better but one thing is for sure, Asia has got some balls of steel to read something like that in front of an entire English class.  Later on I asked someone what made them so sure it was written about me and they told me that the title of her writing assignment was "Angel."  Boy that was long.

      Ok Daniel and I completed our work on  duality  last night around 3 am.  We had filmed until 5 am the night before.  I am extremely proud of it.  It blows Robbery In Progress out of the stratosphere.  I've been getting amazing feedback on it thus far, and I hope you all enjoy it.

      Yesterday I had to wake up early to head down to my school to pick up my report card.  I scored my highest average ever at Randolph and I was pleased.  Afterwards, Dan and I went to his house to paint his mother's bedroom.  We got $25 dollars a piece, which was very nice.  After that we got a ride over to the Riverdale Metro-North station and took the train up to Hastings to meet Kyle, Britty, and Becky to go see Fahrenheit 9/11.  The documentary was very good, most of all, it was touching.  I got teary-eyed during this part of the movie where the mother of a soldier, who died in Iraq, was reading his last letter to her.  It's hard watching a documentary by Michael Moore--sometimes you want to laugh, but then immediately afterwards you want to cry.  Afterwards, Kyle left us and we went to Britty's for some food.  Then Rachel came down.  We had a good time chillin in the basement.  It was a good time.  I'm gonna miss Rachel tons during these two months.  :(  I'm gonna write Rachel and Stephanie while they're at camp though.  In lighter news, I got a 100 on my global history regents and an 89 on my chemistry regents.  I'm extremely proud of my history score but slightly disappointed with my chemistry score.  I'm gonna start getting some real work done on my short story.  Either today, or tomorrow, or both days, I'm going to be mapping out my protagonist--his history, his future, his emotions, his reactions, the works.  It will make him more tangible in the story, and more realistic in my own mind.  After I do that I'm gonna take a good hard look on what style of writing I want to use in this story, what themes I want to convey, and also intricately mapping out my plot.  Once all that is done, I'm going to write.  I might end up scrapping the first two pages I wrote during the Spring if they don't fit in with the direction I head in.  I'm looking forward to all that.  That's all for now.  My next entry will be about the film, Elephant.

      I read a lot of people's live journal's, xangas, and blogs and it seems that the popular thing to do these days is write an entry of reflection on the school year that's just passed.  It's a daunting task because I've changed so much over these past ten months.  After leaving Fieldston I was a complete wreck, worse than I was while  at  the damn school.  During the summer I was better able to come out of the depression and look for new things in my life to fill in for things I didn't want or had lost.  But, essentially, I was still holding on to people, and attitudes that were keeping me from growing.  It's a hard thing to explain.  Imagine a person who's completely unfit to function socially and internally.  Then imagine that person being stripped of the thing that was causing them that discomfort.  Then imagine that discomfort fading away slowly, leaving residue along the way as the person continues to change.  That was me during the summer.  I was very much enlightened and enriched by my experience working at the day care center.  I think that was instrumental in helping me to mature.  I look at myself in several stages; there's a few Fieldston stages, the first of which I liked but as my personality deteriorates in those stages, I like who I was less and less.  Then there's the stage where I've transferred to A. Philip Randolph.  That stage is riddled with relief, depression, and feelings of failure and detachment.  Then there's the summer, where I'm relieved that I don't go to a school that is nothing more than a reminder of how bad I fucked up at Fieldston and I feel like I can just forget it all.  I liked myself during the summer--I think I was in an ok place.  I dislike myself at Fieldston.  And I pity myself at Randolph last year.  This past fall, I was starting to grow more.  I was nearing the point of having been in therapy with Michael for a year and I was starting to be able to see the differences and the growth.  But I made some bad mistakes in the Fall, and I don't like those actions.  I also burned several bridges that Fall--without building new ones.  And that made me lonely in the winter.  But every Friday, I would find myself at Michael's office feeling more confident, feeling like I was on the right track, feeling like my lonesome feelings would pass.  In the Spring, I built new bridges and my lonelyness passed.  I've brought these feelings of maturity, direction, and confidence in my moral fiber and my decision-making into the summer.  I feel great these days and I look back sometimes to months ago and I see a completely different person.  I don't dwell on the past anymore--I'm too busy looking to the future.  I learned that to be comfortable, you don't always have to have someone to talk to, sometimes you have to have time that you dedicate to yourself and personal growth.  I also learned that life is not only about building bridges, but also about burning them.    Thank-you's? Daniel--you're constant solidarity has always been a guidance to me.  We're a team at everything and I wouldn't have it any other way.  You may not realize it but I aspire to many of your qualities.    Michael--you're not going to read this, but I'll go on anyway.  I used to wonder why you never talk very much during our meetings and why I always have to lead the conversation.  Now I know that what you've taught me is much more valuable than the things you could have been saying.  You taught me and you're still teaching me how to make the right decisions and figure out my feelings for myself--rather than acting out in opposition to them.  Everyone from school--all the people from school have been so great this year.  I would have never known that I was going to love my school this much if anyone had asked me last year.  And I love my school because of the warm, outgoing people that attend it.  My parents--for knowing that no matter how bad things got, I could always figure out how to pull through on my own and never judging me when I was down and out.  This whole thing is probably very confusing and hard to follow, but long story short, I'm happier than I've ever been before, I've changed  a lot , and all those good things are all thanks to a number of influential people in my life, and some long, hard, self-reflection.

      Tuesday was my last day of school and it was terribly boring and extremely uneventful.  I felt like calling my mom and telling her to tell the school to let me go home but I decided to stay for it.  I'm looking forward to my summer--though I guess it hasn't started in full-effect yet since I still have to take my chemistry regents next Wednesday.  After that, my summer would have started for sure.  I took the global history regents today.  It was very easy, and I wouldn't be surprised if I pulled off a perfect score--but I probably didn't.  I prepared for the test by taking three old global history regents yesterday and taking a bunch of practice questions on a regents prep website.  I also went downtown and bought myself a barrons chemistry book with old regents in it to prepare for next Wednesday's test.  Maybe I'll get some work done on my next wallpaper tomorrow.  A bunch of it is done, I just need to incorporate some more effects and stuff.

      The first part of the math final was easy as hell.  Noiiiceee.  Here's hoping the second part is just as easy!  Only two more finals then sophomore year is DONE!  I can't wait.  But then I've got two regents afterwards--global history and chemistry.  I'm probably just going to re-read my SAT II book as preparation for the History regents and I guess read over the chapters that we covered this year in chemistry in preparation for that.  Both regents should be easy enough--chemistry being harder than history.  I might go to the Puerto Rican Day Parade this weekend, I probably will in fact.

      The only thing I'm remotely apprehensive about in terms of my finals is math.  I know it should be easy but this woman is a sadistic, menopausal sociopath.  She's liable to give us a rediculous final that I don't even understand, or maybe she'll give us a final where all the multiple choice questions are wrong and we're forced to pick wrong answers (happens once or twice on every test we take), or maybe her personal favorite: grading our tests wrong so that we get lower grades.  She did it to us on our midterms during this marking period and she misgraded a few problems on my last test, and one on my test before that.  I just want a sensible test; if we have a sensible test, I'll ace it because after all I am an A student in math--but I just know we're not going to get a sensible test.  It's a very slight worry as I've put it in the back of my mind and frankly, 90% of me doesn't give a fuck how the final goes but there's still 10% that's worried she's gonna fuck me over.  I'm so happy that she's not returning to teach at our school next year, not because I won't have her--I wouldn't have gotten her again anyway but because the up and coming kids wont have to endure her psychosis.  Her departure is a real service to the kids continuing Math-B next year.  My finals officially end on Monday.   Tomorrow I have: Global History Final Day 1 (Thematic essay) English Final Day 2 (Continuation of in-class literary essay) Math Final Day 1 French Final Day 2    Monday I have: Global History Final Day 2 (Multiple choice) English Final Day 3 (Just in case I'm still not done with my essay) Math Final Day 2    Then the Global History regents go down on the 17th and the Chemistry regents go down on the 23rd I believe.     Then I'm all done.  I am going to be so pleased after fourth period on Monday.  It will mark the culmination of a very successful year where I made a lot of new friends and grew in many ways, rapidly at that.  I think back sometimes to as little as four months ago and find myself having drastically changed in some respects.  Next year will be my hardest year of high school to date--but at it's end I'll essentially be done with all  real  high school work.  Next year I'm taking three AP courses--AP Bio, AP U.S. History, and AP English.  I'm going to be taking four regents exams: U.S. History, English, Math B, and French--not to mention the three AP exams.  I'm not sure yet whether an AP exam substitutes for a regents exam--if they do then I wont need to take the U.S. History regents or the English regents.  I can't wait for the summer vacation to start.  I hope I get called for work so I can make my bones and buy me a new computer.  Ok now I must do my last real homework of the year.

      I was so happy today when I took the first part of my two day chemistry final today.  It was an old regents. (i.e. easy as a motherfucker) I'm so glad that Dr. Davidson didn't write up a final for all the chemistry classes like he's done all year, I've never broken a 90 on one of his department tests.  I'm definitely gonna ace this bitch. Woohoo!

      I arrived at school about 15 minutes early to help with the organization of the ballots this morning.  I missed second period preparing a notice for all the election monitors and finishing up sorting the ballots.  I ran the notices to 12 of the 14 monitors in all their respective classes (the last two were no where to be found) just as the bell rung for the end of second period.  CHAOS.  I sped down to the COSA Office where they were all told to rendezvous at and though I didn't get a count, all the election monitors were definitely not there.  They all flooded Mr. Frye and he just randomly gave out folders (each official class/home room had it's own manilla folder filled with blank ballots).  The jobs of the election monitors would be to distribute them, have each official class/home room vote, then collect them, all in a 15 minute window of time--7 floors, approx 30 official classes, over 1500 ballots--the entire election that I had organized almost collapsed.  I ended up distributing and collecting on floors 7,5,4, and even 3.  I was all over the place, sprinting, yelling at kids to vote, etc.  Finally, we hauled down all the folders with the completed ballots and the counting began.  I headed over to the COSA Office during lunch to check if my help was needed and I came just in time to see them finish the tallys for the votes for the President and Vice President of the Junior class.  JANELLE AND I WON!  Out of approx. 600 sophomores, only about 300 kids voted.  Janelle and I got 131 of those votes, the second place group, Innis and Sherica got 87 votes, and the two other groups got about 40 each.  I was very pleased and proud that I had put in the work to create an election that led to my victory.  I can't wait to start in my position next year.  Janelle and I have a bunch of great stuff planned.  -Reinstatement of a Junior Prom for the first time in 14 years. -Standard extra credit added to the schoolwide grading rubric for coming to Saturday tutoring. -Strict enforcement of the schoolwide test schedule. -Saturday SAT tutoring -Scheduling kids for visits to the college office during Junior year rather than Senior year -Thematic school parties (costume parties, etc.) -More stuff that I won't even say here.

      So this morning, my cell phone alarm went off at 6:00 am.  So i crawl to the edge of the bed and reach over to my desk and turn it off and go back to sleep.  Then a couple minutes later, my mom knocks on my door and says, "Wake up."  And I'm like jesus christ wtfffff, and then seconds later it dawns on me: the weekend is over, it's time for school--at which point I rolled out of bed and got ready for school.  That should be classified as the WORST feeling ever.  I just figured I'd share that revelation.

      There hasn't been much of anything up.  The official voting day is tomorrow.  I literally organized the ENTIRE affair.  The school initially had it organized so that kids would individually have to head down to an office and fill out ballots.  I just knew that very few kids would see the incentive in doing that so I told the people in charge that I thought that was a bad idea.  Then they told me to come up with a better idea.  Voila, one week later, I've typed up the ballots for each grade's elections, recruited 14 election monitors, scheduled the voting times, and made over 1000 copies of ballots.  It wasn't as tough as it may sound here, and it is going to be well worth it.  Now we will get everyone in the school to vote.   In other news on Saturday, I was in the city with Dan and we found an amazing smoothie joint.  They make good veggie wraps too.  I'm gonna frequent that locale much more often.   School is out in exactly two weeks and I can almost taste the summer.  Finals are gonna start up next week and mostly just math, and music are pissing me off.  Math is pissing me off because I'm forced to review some stuff and it really blows reviewing math work.  Not to mention that she's littering the days leading up to the two day final with chapter tests on old chapters.  I have to perform exceptionally on every test to restore my math grade back to where I used to have it.  That shouldn't be hard in general except for perhaps the final which might be a little hard, who knows.  I'm making it seem like a bigger deal than it actually is though.  Music isn't actually a problem except for the fact that the class is going to be forced to cheat rampantly all over again because he insists on giving us midterms and finals based on course material that we never covered.  Well that's shitty you-don't-have-a-say-in-this-shit public school for you.  I'm gonna ace it, but it's gonna be by cheating and that makes me feel bad.   I should have a new wallpaper done by Monday at the latest.  This is going to join, "where are my pixels" in the colorblind design line of work--so expect it to be colorful and random as a motherfucker.   I need to read more Hemingway, and faster, because Dan and I are probably going to begin The Sun Also Rises this weekend.  I also want to write some more in my black book.  As soon as school finishes up, I'm gonna start up work on my short story with a vengeance.... 2 da max!   That's all for now.

      Unsatisfied with watching television coverage of the Democratic National Convention, I resorted to downloading the individual speeches off their website, in order to avoid the commentary of talking heads.  Their is a State Senator of Illinois named Barack Obama, who is running for a seat in the United States Senate, and according to the New York Sun, "He is tomorrow."  I couldn't agree more.  His speech electrified me, and everyone in Boston that Monday night--so much so that I emailed Dan with the appropriate links to watch his speech, and I told him that I wouldn't be surprised if in twenty or so years Obama would be at least involved in a Democratic Primary election.  If I have ever seen a black man who has the slightest chance of successfully running for President in the future.  This is the man.  What a landmark event it would be.  A black President, and as if that weren't remarkable enough--he is an amazing politician at that.  He spoke of division, but preached unity.  Barack knows a thing or two about polarity--the New York Sun placed the words better than I ever could, "Mr. Obama, who is half white and half black, is all American."  Keep your eyes open for Barack Obama, his part will come to play in the future, and if it does not, we will have been robbed of a great possibility.  Watch his speech here: http://mfile.akamai.com/12294/mov/dncc.download.akamai.com/12294/07272004/barack_obama_300.mov

      I bought it and started reading it yesterday.  It's three things so far: chilling, excellently written, and informative.  I think that everyone should give this reporta look because it gives Americans the ultimate piece of mind when it comes to terrorism and how our country has responded to it, and how our country is prepared to respond to it in the future.  Personally, I don't watch ABC, NBC, FOX, CNN, or the other media conglomerates for my information on the safety of our nation.  They are part of the lies and the fear culture that Americans have created for themselves.  If you want to learn something for yourself about the enemies that our country faces today, and how our country is facing them, instead of letting a news anchor feed you their version, read the 9/11 Commission report.

      So last night was my cousin's sweet 16 celebration.  It was a party celebrating both her birthday and her best friend's 16th birthday since their birthdays take place right around the same time.  I really didn't feel like going--not because I'm one of these kids who hates their family but just because it didn't sound like it was going to be a lot of fun.  I'll give all my adoring female fans out there a visual of my attire. (yeah, like I've ever had adoring female fans) I wore a blue button down shirt with a navy blue tie with some sort of pattern and stripy thing on it, black dressy slacks, and my shiny black shoes----OK pretty bland but whatever, use your damn imagination.  So we arrived at the location and the DJ was there blasting some Spanish rap, the hostesses were setting the tables and the bar, and relatives were trickling in.  My other cousin, Rigo, the younger brother of my cousin, Krystal, whose party we were at, seemed bored and lonely.  He's going to be nine years old in less than a month.  I decided to give him some company.  Rigo really looks up to me and I remember when I was younger and my older brother, Victor, reached the age group that I'm currently in and he abandoned me for his friends.  That's not a cool feeling, so I try to be a good role model for Rigo.  Once everyone had arrived, the bar was open, the music was blasting, and I was still hanging out with Rigo.  My mom let me finish one of her drinks, and I asked her to order me others.  Soon enough, I had had four of whatever she was having, two orders of rum and coke that my oldest brother, Manny, had slipped me, and a margaritah.  Needless to say, I was fairly drunk.  I'm surprised that I managed to text message with Kyle all night long.  Then my mother started to beg me to dance with her.  That must have been quite a sight.  I was literally on the verge of falling over while dancing with her.  I got better at containing my dizzyness as the night went on though, and I managed to dance with my aunt, my mother, my cousin, and my lesbian second cousin or some other thing.  I get confused with family ties and stuff.  I've rambled quite a bit here.  Long story short, I had a great time because I was able to get drunk and relax instead of dwelling on how different I am from my family.  Today, I met Becky and Kyle and we chilled for a little bit before and after seeing Surefire live at Rothko.  I like hanging out with you two, you're very fun people and it's very nice seeing you guys.  We sat in the park before they caught their train and we had some good laughs.  The little kids were cute and I kind of wanted to play with them--next time.  I had a good day today.  Babay-K's birthday is in a few days and maybe I'll head up there or meet her or her and Becky--I dunno yet.    In other news, I was invited to a sweet 16 of a girl from school.  Frankly, I don't really want to go for several reasons--two of them being that it's in Brooklyn and that I don't know if I have to bring a gift and if I do, I don't feel like buying this particular girl one.  So I think I'm gonna R.S.V.P. and say that my family and I will be in Philadelphia that weekend and I won't be able to attend.  I'll do that just as soon as I get the nerve.  That's about it.  This blog was too long..oh well.

      This summer has begun in a somewhat disappointing way.  Firstly, on the subject of where I was supposed to work this summer--well that doesn't seem to have worked out.  Apparently, they had a limited number of positions this year and they used a lottery to determine who they would hire.  Last year I wasn't on their list either, but they called me a week or two late anyway because someone backed out.  Other kids were called late as well.  So maybe that will happen again this year--but I think it's set in stone this year.  So that upset me a lot for two reasons.  Reason A, which is the most important of the two, is that that job was an activity for me to occupy and enrich myself with throughout the summer--in opposition to sitting at home and rotting.  Reason B is that I was going to gather up all my checks and purchase an iBook in August.  I spoke to my mom about the iBook and she told me I didn't have to worry about it--she would get it for me with my dad.  But the former reason for getting the job was much more important and when I got that news I was very very angry.  And I was also embarassed because people ask you what you're doing this summer and you say working and then you end up not working.  It's also embarassing because everyone's got at least one thing to do this summer.  Me?  Nothing.  There's no trip, no job, no anything.  People who aren't working or going to camp that I know are at least going away for a week or two at some point this summer.  I was talking to Emily yesterday, or the day before that, I've lost track, and she said that her mother might have a job for me and that she'd ask her.  I really hope that works out because that could be a solution to a few of the problems and the general funk I've been in since the beginning of this summer.    Another problem that I have is that I miss people who have gone away until August.  One of these people is Rachel, who I must have talked to every day since March or February for hours on end.  That leaves a big hole in your day and in your social existence.  But it's not too bad, we talk on the phone pretty often and I wrote her and Stephanie a letter the other day.  It just sort of leaves you in a shitty mood though because you miss those people.  A third problem that I'm dealing with is my fucking god awful laziness.  I know I'm going to come out of it any day now but it's just terrible, and you beat yourself up because you know you're not getting anything done.  I haven't been excercising, I haven't been  writing --and that really bothers me because I am really big on my writing and I hate that I haven't been working harder on it, I haven't been working on any graphics--I have a wallpaper in the works that has been sitting in a folder on my desktop for weeks now, and I haven't started thinking about building my website yet either.  Now, let's think about this.  Why haven't I been getting those things done?  Well the answer is that I'm in such a shitty mood all the time that I don't even feel like getting up and getting any of those things done.  This problem is an extension of my other issues.    Here's a background issue.  I want a girlfriend.  I want some love, some affection, some contact.  I need some sort of a real bond with a girl.  It's a fulfilling experience and I feel like I really need it.  That's an embarassing thing to say but I know that virtually everyone my age is looking for that, so whatever, I was the one to say it.  And I just don't FUCKING know what I want.  I have no idea at all.  I've got a current fixation but all I see it ending up in is disappointment.  But I'm less worried about this shit because frankly I'm tired of thinking about it.  I really don't feel like giving a shit anymore and I don't think I will.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  I'm tired of trying to figure girls out.    So there it all is.  Today I woke up at 3:00 pm.  It's 11:30 pm as I type this sentence.  I'm wired.  I'm sitting in the dark with a candle lit and I think I'm going to force myself to fall asleep.  It's not all as bad as it sounds.  I'm not a wreck, I'm not fucking up, I just feel shitty, that's all.  I'm not going to allow comments on this entry because although I want to talk to people and I want people to say the right things, no one will--or at least I won't like what people have to say.

      Today at work I basically painted for almost 5 hours.  It was a small hallway that I painted.  When I first got there, Mary was in a meeting and Laurie told me that she wanted me to paint a wall in the hallway leading to her office.  But I was only to paint up till about 7 feet high.  I panicked a little on the inside, since painting is a big gig and you can't just go and ruin someones floor, or lightswitch, or wall molding because ur not careful.  But I got over it, painted the wall without a hitch, and I cleaned the brushes and wrapped up the plastic floor covers and removed the tape from the wall moldings and whatnot.  Then a few minutes later, Mary came back from her meeting and before she went to her second meeting she said, "Oh could you paint these two as well?  Good job!" It was at this point that I learned Lesson #1: Don't pack up the paint materials unless you're absolutely sure that you are through painting.  So I painted the two other walls and it looked good.  Then Mary and her co-worker came back from their meetings.  They commented on how much better the walls looked and debated whether I should do the top halves of every wall.  Mary won, and I was to paint the top halves.  Now, these walls are easily 13 or 14 feet high.  So that meant I had to lug a 10 foot or so ladder into this cramped ass, hot hallway.  The top halves took me quite a while.  I was sweating so much.  On my third to last wall, once I climbed to the top, the ladder started to slide closed!!!  As the latter legs slowly inched together, my mind started racing.  First I decided to be very still and hope it stopped closing.  When it continued to close, I started worrying about falling and then Mary thinking I'm incompetent.  Finally I decided to climb down really gently.  I did that and luckily I didn't fall.  It was at this point that I learned Lesson #2: Make sure that your fucking ladder is opened all the way before you climb up the bitch.  Anyways, I finished my walls and cleaned my brushes and shit  around 3:00--time to leave.  Mary's been warming up to me, we joked quite a bit today.  Emily also called her mom today, who is Mary by the way.  After that phone call, Mary called me downstairs and she was with a couple of her colleagues.  They told me that they had heard that I do good impressions, and they made me do a little--tres embarrassing! :-\  But it was funny.  THANKS Emily.  Anyways, my job is fun as hell, even if it takes a lot of finesse and heat endurance.  I don't want to see paint again for a long time.

      The first day of work was pretty exhausting.  Here's a brief list of the work I did.  I ran things over to the dry cleaners, moved a shitload of boxes of school supplies upstairs to the classrooms (Lots of heavy lifting and sweat--I was such a hunk today. haha), emptied bookcases into boxes and moved those boxes around, ran a package over to the post office, and delivered documents to some guy's apartment. It was tres hot in the building and when I got home, I was sooo tired.  I napped for a while too.  That's about it for now.

      I interviewed with Emily's mom today at her school.  It was great, she was extremely nice and outgoing, and we had a good talk.  At the end of the interview, she asked me if I could start tomorrow.  I was so ecstatic.  I am working from 10 am to 3 pm from Monday through Thursday.  And on Friday I work from 10 am to 1 pm, but there are going to be instances where I stay later.  I'm basically going to be running errands, carrying things around, maybe some painting.  Then around the third week, I'm going to start on more office oriented work, directly under Ms. Gaines.  My pay will be $8 an hour, which is huge for me.  Last summer I worked for minimum wage.  I owe a huge thanks to Emily for hooking me up with her mom.  This is gonna be so awesome.

      I had a remarkably tiring day today.  Dan slept over last night and we woke up around 10 am to head over to the park near Yankee Stadium and play--which would be convenient since Steph and Rachel would be going to a game there around 1 pm with their camp and Dan and I haven't seen them in weeks.  Steph called us when we got there and we talked to them in front of the stadium for a few minutes before we got in.  I felt a little uncomfortable though since I didn't know any of those camp people.  But I hugged Rachel and that was awesome since I miss her so much.  Then Dan and I played soccer for so frickin long that by the time we were completely worn out, the camp was leaving the baseball game, so we got to talk to them for a few more minutes on their way out of the stadium.  I saw Rachel's main-squeeze, Goopen.  But I only saw him from behind...Then Dan and I bought some smoothie materials from the nearby supermarket and walked back to my house which was almost unbearable after playing non stop soccer for hours.  But we made it.  I was sooo dirty though so I showered when I got home.  Then we made smoothies and those shits were so ill.  A couple hours later around 7 pm or so, we just collapsed.  Dan is still asleep but I'm up doing this shit.  I'm done tho.  Peace.
