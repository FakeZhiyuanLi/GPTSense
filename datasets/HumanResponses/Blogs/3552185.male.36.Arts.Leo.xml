      Like any expectant parents, Valerie and I are concerned that we won't have enough money to provide for our baby, that we won't have insurance ( a biggie), that we won't ever be able to pay off our student loan mortgage and own a home of our own. It's our biggest concern, and sometimes even leads us to question our basic suitability as parents. Sometimes it feels like we're just on the cusp of understanding how we can put our own particular talents to work for us in a way that will provide us joy and a fat bank account.   I went to a bit of a  urlLink Grad School  reunion last week, for Matt's birthday. Ryan was there, and wanted to hear all about our pregnancy. I shared a bit of our hopes and fears, cares and dreams, and mentioned how money was a concern.  She told me about another classmate of ours, Dan, whose wife had been pregnant with their first child while we were all in  Grad School. Of course, as an actor, Dan had shared many of the concerns that Val and I have right now - mainly, money, money, money. Dan's Korean father said, "Don't worry, babies bring their own money."  When I told Val about that, she said,  "Thats why I'm so damn big - he's got a couple suitcases of cash in there!"  Ryan went on to say that ever since, whenever a couple she knew had a child, Dan's Dad's belief was borne out. The new parents got a promotion, or made a change in their career direction, but something always happened that gave them the security they craved for their new child.  I hope that's true. Valerie and I have no shortage of skills, but we haven't been able to find the situation where both of us can be creative and get paid handsomely with security and benefits.  Faith. That's what I'm trying to generate. Faith that we will find positions where our skills and creative talents will be valued and rewarded in positions with authority, responsibility, and longevity. Faith that we will find our niche, whether it be cooking  urlLink homemade jellies and jams  in our kitchen, or running a cafe in  urlLink Brattleboro , or forming a little repertory company and shooting our own films, or joining the  urlLink Oregon Shakespeare Festival  and staying for ten years, or nailing positions at one of the  urlLink TV networks  on a long-running impossibly popular television show.  Faith. that's a tough one.

      We were holding off on discovering the gender. We thought it would be exciting to look forward to discovery at the moment of birth, one of the last surprises left to us. My friend David thought that finding out the gender was a bit of an intrusion; Val’s friend Carla said we should find out because “it just makes things easier.” I was on the fence, if that can be possible, as I thought the surprise would be wonderful, but it would also be a relief to split the name list in half and pick the nursery paint, to say nothing of JUST KNOWING what it was that was tumbling round in Val’s belly. Two weeks ago, at the moment of truth, Ferma the sonographer said, “Well, do you want to know or don’t you?” And Val caved. Just couldn’t wait. Ferma rolled the magic wand across Val’s belly, back and forth, back and forth, but the little bean was bashful. Finally Ferma squealed, “Look! Outdoor plumbing!” Just the first of many indignities you’ll have to suffer, my son.  We knew in our hearts it was a boy. A year ago Valerie saw a palm reader who said that she would have two miscarriages (or girls – turns out it’s the same thing in palmistry!) and then a boy. Months ago, shortly after we knew we were pregnant, I had a vivid dream where I lay in our blue tub with a baby boy on my chest. All was warm as he cooed he chirped. And finally, we were having a hell of a time thinking of girl’s names – they just wouldn’t come.  But names for boys? We are awash.   We started off with very Old Testament names. We didn’t plan to – it just happened that way. Abraham, Benjamin, Ezekial, Luke, Samuel (still like that last one myself). Then Michael and Paul said we needed to be more daring, more adventurous. Beau, Logan, Dylan.  But we keep coming back to Zachary. Turns out it’s actually been a very popular name the last several years. Guess we shouldn’t let that stop us, if we really like it. Another great contender is Marcus, to keep Mortie’s line in the mix.  Lately I’ve been thinking of Wesley. And I can’t understand why nobody likes the name Skittle. Hell, if Gwynnie can call her baby Apple, then why can’t we go with Rutabaga? And he’d have a hell of a career in porn if he were named Brock.  But no matter what, we’ve decided not to name him till we meet him; we won’t decide until we look the little bugger in the eye and get formally introduced.

      well this is my first entry to the blog, let it go on record I am not sure I want to do this...It feels a bit to public, but what the hell. Just entered week 21 and my belly is OUT THERE for the world to comment on. No hiding now. Feeling pretty good, but tired and HUNGRY!!! Just can't seem to eat enough, so every two hours the monster within...Must feed. but really, feeling much better, just trying to figure out the " work thing",  I am so used to working at a feverish pitch on production work or catering, it became clear over the weekend I have to move slower I have to find work  that allows me to move slower. We live at such a fast pace here.  I find it very odd to move slower in NYC, one feels very vulnerable to the movement of the crowd,One becomes hyper aware of how people around you move and one spends a lot of energy  trying to not get run over or hit by passing the bodies. FUNNY STORY: I was walking at Port authority bus terminal on 42nd St. The other night, and two big loud  rather intimidating men where sitting there, and I hear, "oh yea, hey baby!" I stopped in my tracks and started to laugh, and said" do you mean me or the baby?" pointing to my stomach.  He stopped cold, a moment that could have gone either way , suddenly he laughed and apologized. I said later to all, got to get some chocolate, baby needs sugar! v

      I thought that this might be a good way for Valerie and I to share the whole experience of our pregnancy with friends and family, rather than sending out dozens of separate emails with photo attachments. I hope it doesn't seem impersonal, but I think this blog might actually become a meeting place for all of our extended families to view the latest developments and comment, chat,  urlLink  see the latest pictures , and so forth.  Valerie is worried that it's a bit too public, but we don't really keep secrets anyways, and besides, with all the content on the web these days, what stranger is going to take up his/her time reading about our pregnancy?  That said, we are halfway through this, our third pregnancy. I wish I had gotten this idea earlier, but better late than never, eh? Tomorrow, Monday, June 7, will be the beginning of our 21st week, and Val has been showing for weeks. As Val's friend Mark says, she is "so knocked up". There have been no kicks yet, unless you count the thump Val felt as she was eating a sausage McMuffin Friday, but she thinks it was just gas. I've been talking to her belly, and placing my ear beneath her belly button to see if I can hear the heartbeat, but nothin' yet.  We're making big home improvements to feather the nest  for the new roommate. I had been disgusted with our kitchen linoleum for years, as it curled up at the corners, and was impossible to clean. I wrote the landlord, and he approved a new flooring, agreeing to pay $150 of the costs. I dug my feet in against linoleum, pushing first for ceramic tile, but then, when it became clear that the cost out of my pocket would be pretty high, downgraded to a wood parquet that Val found at Home Depot at $1.32/square foot. Final bill for our end was $325. It took Tomas, our super,several weekes before he finally got to work, and when he began pullingthe floor back, it looked like an urlLink  archaeological dig , as there was a total of  five (!) layers of flooring beneath. But he did a  urlLink gorgeous job , and I would be happy to have our baby crawling on it.  About a week ago, we moved Valerie out of her office and into mine, making the future nursery a kitty room while Tomas, our super, worked downstairs in the kitchen.  I put up  urlLink shelves for all our shtuff , the cats have returned to their usual haunts, and now we are picking paint colors for the  urlLink nursery .

      Well the heat is upon us  and daily activities are getting harder and harder. I find myself struggling with unemployment, frustration, depression. HOLD ON...Let me stop there. I am very happy to be pregnant, really, I am thrilled to see my belly getting bigger and wonder who the little boy inside will be.   I know that there are so many blessings to be thankful for,  But I would be lying if I didn't admit to feeling depressed and frustrated.  Everything is changing, losing control and slowing down, has been very tough for me , big life lessons. I feel pretty useless and dependent more and more on Steve, which makes me uncomfortable, because I know how he trying to find his own footing, come to terms with all he is dealing with.  I have got to find some work. UGGGHH!! Hard also to know the "normal" aches and pains from" scary" aches and pains. somedays they are very simular to miscarriage pains. But then I try to calm myself down and trust. I want to be able to feel "stronger" more at peace, believe this is all heading where it should. I guess the only way to start that is to  just start smiling more. Right?

      Went to  urlLink Christopher’s opening  Monday night. He did really fine work- funny, scary, heartfelt, and absent of mannerisms. Everybody should go see it if they can.  His character works in a cube farm at an unspecified corporation, purpose undisclosed. He gets gradually more and more bleak and cynical about his life, and while enduring the inane chatter of a co-worker blathering about his three kids, says “Why did you bring them into this world?” The guy says –   “Hmmm...Guess i just wanted to take the pressure off myself.”   …which brought me a big laugh, perhaps too big, because he continues -    “Wanted to take care of someone else, 'stead of just thinkin' about me all the time... dang, better get back to work.”  Good point.

      I’ve never gotten one, because I couldn’t decide what to get. Well, that’s not exactly true. I found this great Native American image that kind of pinpointed how I felt about things on bad days, and I loved it. The problem was, I didn’t know what tribe the image was from, or even what it meant. What if it stood for The Great Baby Eater, or He Who Wipes his Butt with Poison Ivy? I wouldn’t want to have that stuck on my arm forever. If I knew what it meant, and if it represented something at least halfway noble or heroic, I’d probably go for it.  I also wanted to get a tattoo of the  urlLink rooster  Valerie and I used as our wedding mascot. I was going to surprise Valerie the last time she went out of town, but of course, funds were too short.  When I was in grad school, I had a friend, Miriam, who was one of the best stage managers I ever worked with. In fact, she SM’d the premiere production of Eric Bogosian’s SubUrbia at Lincoln Center. Miriam was tattooed just about everywhere. Not only that, but she had piercings, and brands.  She told me that once you find an image you want for a tattoo , wait a year, and then, if you still want it, go for it. But she also cautioned me that tats were an addiction – that you actually get a physical high in the act of getting one, and that they ended up like popcorn, and you just keep on going.   Don't know where Miriam is these days. I last saw her in late '96, when she and a friend were moving out of their apartment on West 72nd. They were moving to Greece, to live in an olive grove. She sold me her kitchen table for three hundred bucks, and we're still using it.  When I was a ward of the State, there was a guy in one of the group homes named John Claypoole, He was lanky and cynical, with straight blond Allman Brothers hair. Something about his wit or intelligence gave him a stoic dignity and nobody messed with him too much. He was an amazing artist, and when he got free of the State he wanted to be a tattoo artist.  I hope his dream came true and that he’s got a successful studio somewhere.  Maybe if I could find him, he could tattoo my son’s name for me, maybe on my chest, in the middle of one of those old school flaming hearts. After all, by the time my son is born, I’ll have been waiting 9 months. That’s close enough to a year, right?

      We spent Sunday in Mendham for  urlLink Baby Janie’s naming ceremony . A perfectly lovely day. Happy to see Patrick home from the Gulf and reunited with Hillary, Alex, and his new baby, Janie. Val was feeling great – Baby was hungry, so she obliged with pickles, chicken liver, and two slices of cake. Big mistake - Monday was a very loogy day.   Came up with an excellent parental fashion tip – tie dyed clothes will hide all sorts of infantile effluence….

      Sorry it's been so long since my last post. All my spare time for writing was spent on vetting writing samples for my  urlLink CityKids  interview.  Carla gave Val her old pregnancy pillow. The company calls it  urlLink The Snoogle , but we like to call it  urlLink The Octopus . Val says it works well for naps, but is a bit unwieldy for full nights - she wakes up strangling herself.  Speaking of pregnancy products, I decided to get Val some light cotton summer dresses for our second (cotton) aniversary. I picked out three dresses for Valerie from  urlLink Motherhood . Five days later, the DHL tracking results showed that delivery had been attempted, with no luck. Huh. That's funny, because Valerie was home all day and night....  Two weeks after ordering, the anniversary had passed, and I was empty-handed. I was also quite steamed. After three calls to Motherhood's 800 number, two calls to Airborne and a visit to my post office, I decided to play hardball. I got hold of a supervisor's direct line at Motherhood, and the name of the CEO. Three messages later (including a threat to contact the CEO the next day), I received a very sweet email from the supervisor, stating they would overnight the dresses, along with a gift certificate. 24 hours later, the dresses arrived.  To sum up, DHL sucks. Motherhood was bombing out in the customer service department, but they made good on the whole thing.  urlLink And the dresses look great.  Pregnant ladies, take from our experience what you will.

       urlLink My temp job has gone perm , and it’s a great relief. It’s a big bump, and baby will get bennies. The job is going to bring stability and security, and will carry us through Val’s “confinement”, to revive a Victorian turn of phrase.  However, I have no desire to be a “People Services Coordinator” for the rest of my life. It’s funny, but this pregnancy hasn’t really brought up many new issues for me, only brought latent ones to the surface with a greater intensity.  “I need a decent job with benefits”  “I gotta get in shape.”  “God I wish I didn’t have this massive student debt”  “ I gotta quit smoking”  “I really want to write Treatment“   “I wanna paint that wall.”  “Will I ever be able to work in the theatre and make a living at it?”  None of these issues is new, by any stretch of the imagination. But with a kid on the way…well, they’re bigger. That’s all I can say. And I’m not bowed by pressure, something I know Val is worrying about. Yes, I feel responsible for providing for our little family. But being able to fulfill our family need has actually made me feel more adult, more responsible, more of a MAN.   It’s no secret I’ve been trying to find a job that will keep me in the theatre, yet will give me a constant dependable salary. Were we not pregnant, I’d still be taking this job, ‘cuz frankly, it’s the best thing going right now.   But the question remains – how to structure my days, so that I can bring home the bacon and stay healthy, yet fit in home improvement, fathering, and creative pursuits as well? How do I pay the bills, yet keep my eyes on the prize?  SJ- “Remember- we can do for a year what we don’t have to do forever.”

      If a newborn is crying relentlessly, put your lips to her ear, and as loud as she is crying, go “SSSHHHHH!” Supposedly, it quiets them instantly, as it mimics the loud noise in the womb. Can’t wait to give it a try.  I asked my friend Tom, an actor and longtime massage therapist, if there were any areas to avoid when massaging a pregnant woman. Turns out that massaging the ankles or wrists of a pregnant woman can stimulate pre-term labor! Beware…  Hey Sidney! You were right about  urlLink chocolate and happy babies!

      We’ve been slammed with a new obsession – a house.   Dan and Ellen live up in  urlLink Bolton, Connecticut , amidst rolling hills and corn fields, mere minutes from my alma mater,  urlLink UConn . They’ve got a great old farmhouse on 6  urlLink acres  that stretch back to meet state land. Across the road from them is a little  urlLink farmhouse  that’s been on the market for almost a year.  Val and I have been plotting to leave the city for a couple years now, applying for teaching positions in more bucolic surroundings, keeping our eyes on  urlLink ArtSearch  and our ears to the grapevine. Now, with the baby on the way, I listen to the hoochie mamas scream at their boyfriends outside my window and I worry that my boy will have no yard in which to pitch a tent.  We think we wanna get out.  And it’s not just about the kid. We just don’t feel like we’re enjoying the city anymore. It seems to be getting the best of us, rather than the other way round. And frankly, I like myself better up in the green world.   So we’ve seen this house a couple times now, when we’ve gone up to convalesce at D&E’s. It’s got a big old barn, and a flat field for playing 2 hand touch. A cellar and a bulkhead. The property is 2.5 acres, and it butts up against a cornfield. Major university 15 minutes away,  urlLink state parks , Boston less than 2 hours away. To say nothing of having family right across the road.  So it hit me Saturday, hard. We should just try and get in there. Build a new life, with a lighter pace. Commute to NYC for work until something gets lined up at UConn, or Hartford, or we just start our own catering business. Just get out, and head north.  One problem though – money.  Ah yes. That.

       Just a plug today for our friend Travis Peace, who some may have met at the wedding, the very dapper gentleman in the blue seersucker suit…..  He is about to swim his fourth swim across America to raise money for Cancer, and I wanted to sent a link to his webpage. He first swam in memory of his dear friend Eileen Markwalter,  and over the years others have been added to the list of those he swims to remember. Like so many of us who have lost loved ones and friends to Cancer, I plan on donating to the memory of my dear friend Janey Klein, who we lost last year to lung cancer.  Below is the link if you are so moved to do the same for someone you may want to remember:   urlLink Swim Across America

         so far so good, week 27, which means we start the third trimester on Sunday.... countdown to opening night!!! I confess, the nights are tough; getting enough sleep and finding comfortable positions to sleep in, also, the heat is killing me. But mostly feeling pretty good otherwise...  Here are two things I know:  1. It’s going to be hotter 2. I am going to get even bigger....  Other things I know! A pattern has emerged.    •	MONDAY / TUESDAY: seems to be growing days, the baby rarely kicks and I am wiped out!!!!  •	WEDNESDAY: is “eat everything in sight day, and the kicks are often and intense. (This is usually the night Steve comes home and says:’ wow you ‘ve gotten bigger..” eyes bulging out of his head and a slightly scared expression crosses his face. REALITY! •	THURSDAY:  recovery day: recover from all the weird food I shoved in face on Wednesday.  Not working much, and home a lot, which is nice, but I am a bit antsy!!! So, I have gotten in touch with my inner domestic goddess, and I have decided to try to master 4 baked goods: •	A French baguette  •	A cookie  •	A muffin  •	A brownie So far just making baguettes, and have turned this house into a test kitchen...so eventually I can open a bakery...my new plan, why not! Baking has always eluded me and so I am practicing...so far not so good, but it is a cheap hobby and no one gets hurt...except Steve’s tummy, since he is the victim of latest obsession.  Got to go, the timer just went off,
