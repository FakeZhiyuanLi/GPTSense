      Hey everybody.  It's almost 9 here on Sunday night.  I feel like my mind is in a haze...I can't seem to motivate myself out of it, and that troubles me.  I mean, there are so many things I can, or  should , be doing right now (writing, schoolwork, reading, watching Dubcheck's place, going out with Frank).  I dunno.  I mean, sometime it feels like I'm perpetually half-asleep, and the only reason I get anything done is because I go on auto-pilot, and my body allows me to run through the motions.  Pretty pathetic, I know.

      got home from no thrills.  i let eazy-e drive home, and we had a good time trying to teach the parallel parking.  she gave me a super sweet note, which made my day.  i was supposed to have exchanged gifts with the posse today, but i heard paul and debbie got in late from their folks, so i guess that is held up until later this week.  i did get my gift from capt and heather; in addition to a cool book on moviemaking and a simpsons clue game, i got a ric flair dvd set.  not something i'd want too many people seeing in my collection, but i know i'm gonna watch it! :P

      hey gang.  this is my most recent attempt at keeping some kind of online journal.  hopefully it is a tad more successful than the last, and by that i mean that i hope to update this more frequently than the old version.  i want this weblog to try to keep a close focus on the evolution of my first movie production "service with a smile", which i hope will begin shooting soon (reading this, rita my dear?).  but i won't be surprised if some other aspects of my life find their way in the door to this site.  i hope i will not go into rant mode too often.  today i'm going downtown with eva.  i gotta return a shirt my brother got me for xmas (it's a shade large), and the plan is to go skating after some shopping.  say a prayer for me.

      what is up?  just a few short notes:  * rita is doing some very hard work to get the pieces together for shooting next week.  let's all wish her luck and offer our help in putting together this huge jigsaw puzzle!  * i just bought an agenda.  let's see if it helps me become organized.  * i met with lawyers today.  not as much fun as it sounds.  * let's say a prayer for sophie, my supervisor at the store, who lost her dad this week.  * tricheck is off to croatia on monday.  let's wish him luck.  visit his online gallery soon at  urlLink www.tvrtko.net   * short-change swindlers suck!  * anyone need a pain-in-the-ass sibling?

      hey there all you cool cats and chicks!  i'm staying home this saturday night because i suck.  actually, i suck and swallow (at least according to clara anyways)  no, actually, i'm staying home because i really don't have the energy to do anything too strenuous at all.  I have worked every day since the 13th, and i don't have a day off until the 30th.  in other words, darrel is a very dull boy.  i was pleasantly surprised when i went on los angeles radio station kcrw's website ( urlLink www.kcrw.com ) yesterday.   i was hoping to tune into one of elvis mitchell's shows while i tidied my room, but instead i, completely by accident, stumbled on episodes of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.  i had hoped to have a listen to these for a while now and could not find them, so to come across them so inadvertently was quite a treat.  if you are at all interested in douglas adams, and have realplayer installed, check out  urlLink http://www.kcrw.com/show/hg .  what can i say...i'm a closet nerd.  i hope to have a big announcement regarding the movie soon, but i have to keep quiet for now.  check back here in a bit, and wish me luck!

      just got back from having coffee with a few old pals.  we gossiped a bit, told a few funny stories, and generally had a laugh.  ever have one of those nights with old pals that make you wonder why you haven't gotten together more often?  tonight was one of those...  last night i went out with the posse...it was fun.  happy birthdays go out to my brother brian (26) and pauly of the posse (28).  this is the first update since i reformatted my hard drive because of the "porno" virus.  i lost a few files, but i saved most everything.  this'll teach me to do regular backups, and not to open strange files from the net!

      what is up my peeps?  just a quick update for y'all...  first off, work is stressing me out a shade.  i really should be looking for a full-time job right now.  i'm getting paid crappy money for doing two even crappier jobs, and i think it's about time that changed.  i just cringe at the idea of being stuck in some boring stiff tie for the rest of my life with a bunch of stupid dorks working around me.  secondly, rita is working really hard to get things ready for shooting.  this encourages me, which is good, because for a little while there i wasn't so convinced that this bird was going to fly.  so thank you rita, if you are reading this, and good work.  i am going to work on some of the rewrites tonight... nothing too extreme, just some touch ups on the dialogue and the backdrop to account for the change in climate.  i might add a "hot shower scene" for tricheck, too.

      it is my birthday today!  27!  boy, i'm so aged :(  seriously enough though, i had a superb birthday...the best i can remember.  went to mass, ate a big breakfast, including pancakes, went for tea and did some writing there on a future project, and then home for pizza and ice cream at night.  i'm so stuffed and so very content.  and i got some groovy gifts.  chuck e. cheese maybe next week for pauly's b-day!  seriously, i want to thank everybody who gave me birthday wishes, and those who were kind enough to spend their time with me.  love you all, esp. miss nitsch!  please remember not to genuflect while receiving communion...it holds up the line!

      word up.  director-boy here.  just want to say a few things.  first off, i'd like to thank everybody involved in the shoots the past couple of weekends.  everybody, from liz, julia, and gary behind the scenes, to jennifer, bryson and greg in front of the camera, and paul and francis, who filled in superbly in dual-role cameo performances worthy of some significant industry talk, did a great job and i am humbly impressed by their efforts.  special thanks go to justin, for his hospitality and talents behind the camera, terry for hooking up the michael power gig, and jordan and the crew from tu tu tango for the food and love; your generosity is truly appreciated.  super-duper-special-thanks go to rita, who, as queen-producer has hooked up most of the locations and equipment while ridding ourselves of burdens and dead-weight that has hampered us in the past (cough, cough... no comment!).  excellent work!  i had dinner at the nitsch clan's last night (and i promised binder boy another speaking part...i'll have to think up something for the sweetie).  pork chops and blueberry pie!  my eyes have been opened to a grand new world!  and i must say that this weekend might have been the best ever.  from the mcflurry on friday, to saturday's banana split, to sunday's pie a la mode, it was a blast!  ice cream overload!  the company was WAY better than the dessert, though!  more laughs this friday, i hope.  big shooting day!  peace out.

      hey ya.  well, i'm cranky as anything.  between getting this movie happening, working 7 days/wk, looking for work, and Lenten sacrifices, i'm exhausted and stressed.  i haven't felt this tired and zombie-like in some time, and i'm thinking it's not for me.  not that i'm complaining about my lot in life... i'm healthy, and happier than i can ever remember being.  and i'm very grateful to have some very cool and special people around me, even if i don't get to see some of them all that much anymore!  i bought a couple of used books a couple of days back...but i have no idea when i'll get a chance to read them!  i'm in the middle of "east of eden" and "hitchhiker's guide" still, but i started those books in september/october and i'm nowhere near finishing!  i have like 5 new books that i bought that i haven't even cracked open yet!  shame on d!  going to computerfest this saturday with paul and binder boy.  i don't plan on spending much money... but it's so darn tempting!

      1) el capitano turns the big 3-0 today.  let's all hope he has a grand ol' birthday.  i went out with the posse on saturday for the first time since january, and we had a good time with our stories and silliness.  2) i'm very excited about the new direction we are going with our lead character, alfred morgan!  sometimes good things happen when you least expect them to...  3) had my first day off yesterday since ash wednesday (17 days working in a row)... and i played photographer in the park.  that was fun! (now i know what "brunch" is!)  i met up with mark "pee wee" sultana afterwards...looks like he took a job away from his friend.  save the drama for your mamma!  4) i became "alpha-darrel" on saturday...i got all riled up and asserted myself with this guy i had a significant beef with.  i hope it doesn't become a regular occurrence...i'm really not a guy who looks for fights, but if i need to i will stand up for myself and those i care about.  don't f*** with d-z!!!  5) tricheck is, once again, a sellout.

      darrel here.  if i ever knew early on that making a movie was going to be this frustrating and problematic, i am not sure it would have been an endeavor i would have dared undertaken.  i might have just tried to sell the script or maybe not have even bothered.  it seems that every step forward is followed by a swift shove propelling us back to where we started.  well, although it hasn't been easy, we have gotten this far and i am not prepared to fold up shop now.  i love my cast, i love my crew, and i think this is a script that could really entertain some people.  now, it's just a matter of finding the missing pieces of the puzzle and doing my best as director to make sure that this is fully realized piece of drama.  i am not going to comment on anybody in particular here, but i would like to say am not at all upset that certain people are no longer involved in the making of this picture.  i can't deny that i am a shade disappointed, but i am not upset.  i do understand that this is very much a labor of love, so it does not bring me any great discomfort to know that some of the people who have been involved in this picture are no longer contributing.  we all have our own agendas and our own priorities, and we need the people involved with this picture to love doing it and to be excited about the project.  those people who do not share that same passion and desire can spend their time doing more productive things, and i wish them luck with that.  just one opportunity lost...  someone asked me today if we had put the word out to "off" one of the aforementioned former contributors to this picture.  i replied that as of yet i hadn't, but that i was taking estimates!  :)  i must say that given the new lower prime rate, executions are becoming increasingly affordable!

      hola amigos  i hope you've noticed the new look of the journal/weblog.  i decided to get a blogger account because it will allow me to archive my posts easily without having to do all kinds of coding (which actually might be beneficial to me because i haven't programmed much lately!)  i might try to update/polish this site soon with some tweaks (photos, videos, etc.)... keep visiting and hopefully you'll find this to be a rather impressive site!

      my day so far:  9:00 - wake up.  9:30 - my mom tells me that she is going to the store, the bank, and the dry cleaners.  i feel a bit bad that i can't drive her on her errands, as my car is in disrepair.  i wish her well on her day.  9:35 - stumble out of bed.  9:45 - raisin bran is good.  gotta stop eating it though -- too much sugar.  10:00-11:00 - i don't remember much about this period.  i brushed my teeth... and i think i looked through yesterday's newspaper.  11:00 - try to prepare my taxes without accounting for my business expenses.  wow, i owe THAT much?!?  12:37 - got a phonecall from a nice girl with a nice voice.  i feel nice.  13:30 - i just got my mastercard bill.  wow, i owe THAT much?!?  oh year, and my mom made me scrambled eggs with toast.  14:32 - i'm going to get ready for work, my 22nd day in a row.  adios!
