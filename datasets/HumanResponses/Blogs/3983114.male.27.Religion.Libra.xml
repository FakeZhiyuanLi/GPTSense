      Here I sit in my non-airconditioned office, feeling each degree of humidity affect my body, while my parents and brothers tour Germany.&nbsp;   I will visit Subway for lunch, where I will eat a boring six-inch Pizziola sub and drink 32 ounces of Diet Pepsi, when I could be eating at a German restaurant enjoying a nice glass of beer.&nbsp;   I will later spend my entire evening in meetings, missing out on dinner and games with my wife and kids, when I could be seeing places of historical significance.&nbsp;   I'm the one who took German in college.&nbsp;   I'm the one who studied Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther, and Karl Barth.&nbsp;   I'm the one who thinks that stollen is the greatest Christmas treat.&nbsp;   But no, I am in Pennsyl-boring-ia, and my parents and brothers are in Germany!

       Yesterday Jennifer and I discovered that we are expecting another child!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  We were not planning to have any more children, but the Lord has a different plan for us!    &nbsp;

       "The Ten Commandments were never intended as a prerequisite of God's favour, a list of essential qualifications for blessing.&nbsp; Rather they are God saying, 'I love you and I've already proved it to you.&nbsp; So trust me.&nbsp; Keep these commandments because not only do they make sense for you, but they are a way of demonstrating and reflecting who I am to the whole world - the God of love and mercy, not of arbitrary power and revenge.'&nbsp; But this liberating message is often lost today." (51)     &nbsp;   Instead of seeing the Ten Commandments as a list of rules and regulations stated to gauge our ability to receive God's blessings, they should be seen as&nbsp;God's instructions on how to live a life that reflects upon who God is.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   "I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from slavery in Egypt."&nbsp; (Ex. 20:2, NLT)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   The Ten Commandments reflect upon a God who is a loving rescuer.&nbsp; He is a God who does not only identify with those who have much, but with those who have little.&nbsp; He is a God who chose to deliver a group of people who were slaves to those in power.&nbsp; Only after their redemption did He show&nbsp;His people&nbsp;a way to live&nbsp;that would speak more about&nbsp;His redemptive love than&nbsp;His&nbsp;judgment and wrath.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Underneath a partly cloudy skyscape, covered in a thin layer of humidity induced sweat, wondering why I haven't done a better job romancing my wife, I welcome everyone to the unveiling of my blog.&nbsp;
