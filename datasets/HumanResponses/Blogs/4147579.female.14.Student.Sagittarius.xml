       I'll have newer pictures on this blog guy soon! I'll put some of my Under-Construction-Room like a before and after or whatever. I didn't take any at camp but i took some of myself one day when i was bored on the digital and i'll put those up when i figure out how. I've got some funny ones of Sharnae too but i dont like scanning stuff in so i'll do that kind of stuff when i'm really bored...or just in the mood.

       i had my first  JV volleyball practice  today. it was cool i guess. not too hard... YET.  but it was cool cuz she told me i was like the most sound person on the time and that she'd been watching me for 2 years and waiting for me to come to BE. except she told me i should be shining not blending in so i gotta figure out what that means and than do somehting about it i suppose. but i'm really more of a blender in new situations...    you know what i'm gonna use the blog guy to talk about                                ::BISHOP ENGLAND!::     aka HIGHSCHOOL! i'm so fucking nervous and i'm not sure why some of yall aren't but AHHH you should be. i'm mean its gonna  rock  and be like one huge party but still. ARE YALL OUT OF YOUR MINDS?!?     first of all i'm gonna have so much fucking homework.    honors sucks.    ----but on the other hand of being like scared to death I'M EXTREMELY EXCITED! i mean new people (GUYS) new like..everything. and everything will be better than Mason Prep!     LISTENING TO NOW: my brothers gay ass mix. including Maroon 5 and Evanesecnce or however you spell that
