      Hello from Natchitoches.  Brett, I just realized that I still have your last temptation of christ so when I come to B.R.  to pick up the rest of my stuff ( next two weeks) I will drop it by the store.  Little Jack will be here maybe earlier than we thought.  (original eta June 30 --- moved up one to two weeks possibly)  Life is good and work on the house is moving forward although a bit slowly it seems.  I'm adjusting to the slow pace of natchitoches life again but the traffic is maddening at times. (these people do not know how to drive.  e-mail address is micahdogg88@hotmail.com  The old one still works for now but for how long I don't know.  At least till the end of the summer. Plan a trip up north sometime soon.  New cell phone number is 318.332.8998  Give me a call sometime and let me know how everything is holding up.  Hope to here from everyone soon! -micah

      Monday: Lisa opens & Kevin closes  Tuesday: Brett opens & Kevin closes Wednesday: Brett opens & Lisa closes Thursday: Brett opens & Lisa closes Friday: Brett opens & Lisa closes Saturday: Kevin opens & Lisa closes  Don't think Nancy will be back until next Monday.   Damn. just realized that Lisa is closing at least four, probably five nights in a row. NOT cool... That would kill me.

      I had visions of us posting stories of encounters with insane customers, books we thought were worth mentioing in our different shifts, oddball links, and red alerts when Nancy is on a rampage, but the caffiene is wearing off about now.

      So I Googled myself and got many hits but, alas, none of them had the slightest thing to do with me.  However, there was one site that listed the LSU graduates from 2002 and there I was!    But I did find a poem written by some 8th grader named Christopher Beaver.  Well, here it is...  I Don't Understand      by Christopher Beaver  I don't understand where the universe ends, why I have ADD,  why I have to go to college.   But most of all I do not understand, why life is the way it is. Why they can't stop pollution, why people need to poach innocent animals, how the world started and how it will end.   What I understand most are kids with ADD, who are hyper. They can't keep up. They're called stupid. The teachers don't quite understand them. It takes them more time to understand things.  I understand why it's harder for me to understand.

      We've been having some real "quality" posts over last night, wouldn't you all agree? I think I'll start posting EVERY conversation I have with EVERYBODY... All in the name of entertainment value, of course!   Also, I vow to learn how to make Flash animations in the next month so I can convey to all of you who weren't present the greatness that was Brett's sheep story. Trust me. It'll be worth the wait!

      So, I bought a bike from one of my co-workers this morning for 70€.*  I'm super excited because I no longer have to ride the bus with all the weirdos and winos and stinky peeps.  (It's not really that bad...)  Also, I can take it with me on my daytrips around the region.  Actually, I'm planning a trip to Carcassonne to see the Tour de France and I may just bring my bike along.    I'm sorry my postings are always so informative and not funny like yours.  But this is my only efficient way of keeping all of you informed of my adventures.    Looking forward to reading the next entries...  Le Castor  *the € is stronger than the $, so I guess I paid around $80 for the bike.

      Hello All,  Well, things are working out better for me now that I let my boss know how it's gonna be.  He can come for three to four days and he'll have to stay in a hotel--and not with me!  So far he hasn't made any advances but I'm waiting...  I really wish I could make comments on each entry like you guys do.  Big Brother won't let me access that part of the site.  Bastards!  Oh, and H2O, I can't seem to see your pictures that you posted.  They appear as broken images.  So, just a bid of humor.  Two French expressions that don't work when translated into English.  "Péter des plombs" (To fart lead) means that someone has gone crazy.  "Ca me fait chier" (That makes me shit) means that you are unhappy with something.  Perhaps we should incorporate these expressions into our every day vernacular?  Don't worry, Jen.  I think the Yankees are scum.  A-Rod and Jeter are two big piles of smelly dog shit...

      Hey ya'll,  It seems that my internship "boss" has taken a liking to me--if you know what I mean.  At the beginning he asked me if he could come visit me in Louisiana to see the sights, etc.  And now he's been asking me to find flights to and from New Orleans and New York, where he has a lover (actually I think he thinks he has a lover...) by the way.  This has all turned into some kind of 007 spy game of research and covert tactics to keep it from his collegues, all of whom know about it anyway.  It's silly!  Too bad he has no chance with me...And even if I did bat for the other team, he's A LOT older than me.  Ewwww...  Le Castor

Militant Michelle, Air Force Jen, Nurse Erin, Unfriendly Margaret/ Claire, Crazy Robert, Weird Joan, and Loverman Ash Hava all lost their photos.   Darth Scott never had a photo.   I have copies of Narcoleptic Erin T, Christine, and Damien, but not many people remember them.

      What's up, fuckers!!!!  Man, I'm glad I'm out taking boat rides in the Atlantic while ya'll are busy messing with Nancy and crazy ladies who periodically burst into the breakroom like bitches!  (And yes, I know that mad Brett with the rosey cheeks...)  Lately, I've been pretending like I know what's going on around me in seminars and meetings; I just put on my intrigued face and say, "Ah oui, c'est très intéressant."  Since they come from this region and because I've always wanted one, I bought myself a black beret basque this weekend.  Now I'm gonna look super French!  Actually, with my coloring and my English accent, everyone in France thinks I'm--in this order--English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, Australian, German...After that they just give up and act all surprised when I tell them I'm from Louisiana.  "Non, c'est pas possible," they tell me.  Ah, oui, it is possible and I'm living proof...By the way, everyone should check out the new PJ Harvey and the new Beastie Boys...or just get Brett to stea l them for you...oops...did I say that?  Hey, H2O, my e-mail is  .  Send this boy an e-mail!!!  I miss ya'll very much and look forward to my return in a few months...;o)  Beava/Le Castor

      Hi everyone!!!  I actually made it to Baltimore alive, which was more than I could have hoped for.  ^_^  Yesterday we went into D.C. and saw the Phillips collection, went to Eastern Market (which is actually a smelly grocery store...*blech*), and ran through the National Geographic Museum.  Wonderful!  I even got into a debate over Rothko with one of the people working in the Phillips collection!  (Rachel loves Rothko.)  I had lunch at one of the most wonderful sandwhich shops in the world, called Cosi.  *sigh*  I got a bag of baby carrots with my lunch...the brand was "Carroteenies."  *hehehehehehehehe* And yes, Rachel is now a Metro Pro!  I even saw the Booka at Dupont Circle!  (Took a stealthy picture through the trees for all.)  Well, Rachel miss you, but not Baton Rouge, or work, or Louisiana flash-flooding.... ^_^

      Thanks to the cooperation of both Lisa & Nancy, i'm going to get to see the Shins! Nancy didn't stick with her plan to have an opening shift on Friday and have me work Saturday. (That's actually my plan, not hers.) Lisa is working on a turnaround for me. I still have the weekend off too!   I ought to start making CDs for people again. Luke said that he's not yet heard the Shins.

Maybe I'll just bum around like my boyfriend (stinky man), mumble to myself about various things, and drink only half of every coke I buy... yeah that's the plan!  You guys should watch out for me because the next time you see me I'l be "bringin' 'da funk" as Brett put it (i.e., I'll be rankin!)

      Sheesh. I just got a typically angry phone call from Nancy, complaining that Danielle & Ben are not in the computer sytem. I told her this today, and pointed to the memo on the corkboard in the office showing the hours that they have worked. I know that i overstep my job description in hiring and making the schedule, but she wants me deciding the rate of pay as well?   Who should i talk to? I don't want to surrender what responsibilities that have been shoved upon me, as i don't trust anyone else to do them. Nancy has enough sense to know that she's taking advantage of a situtation. However, much of the time i feel that it's a symbiotic relationship. If i can do the job better and enjoy it, why not do it?   I'm just getting tired of being an all-purpose scapegoat for whatever Nancy cannot be bothered to do.

      i was on a break, with my apron off, looking for Kabbalah books in the religion section. An angry woman with thick knitted browed waddled up to me barking, "Weslwing!" I was baffled.   "Weslwing! Weslwing!"  She barreled closer, with me fixed in her aim.   I tried to buy some time, saying i know where the "West Wing" books were, knowing damned well this troglodyte was saying something else. This is a tactic i use, repeating something obviously wrong into tricking the person into correcting me, as sometimes it seems unwise to inform the customer that you cannot understand what she's saying through her slobbering lisp.  "WESLWING!!!" and i expected her to bare her teeth in rage.   Ohhhhhhhhhhh......... so i took her to the wrestling section.

      So I had my interview today. All was going reasonably well until she slowly pulled out a piece of paper and a calculator. She told me to follow her into her lab (she gave me a mini tour of it) and then she sat me down to take a quiz of some sorts. She kept saying that "it's not a test, I just want to see what you remember." So I sat down to   TRY   to take it (note the emphasis on the word try!) I was so mortified 30 minutes later when I went to hand it in (the first words out of my mouth were "I feel so silly...," because I had a really hard time on her "not test." It consisted of about 15 questions that involved dilutions, conversions, and other mathematical computations that you are supposed to learn in Freshman Biology or Chemistry. She told me not to worry too much about it though. I'm not giving up hope yet. She was reading a paper I wrote for some research I did my last semester in school and she seemed really impressed. If I get the job I'd be in charge of the student workers, keeping up the lab (like ordering supplies) and I'd also be doing some sort of research project on my own too. The starting off salary is about $18,500 per year for people without experience (way more than Book A salary so I'll be happy) Lets just hope that she was being totally serious when she said that most people can't remember how to do those kinds of calculations the first time.... Keep your fingers and toes crossed for me guys!

I didn't work today, so I don't have much Booka news, other than to report that Sarah and Jen's "Come-to-the-cafe-we-have-chocolate!" dance is awesome.  Oh, yeah.  I made salsa too.  Does anyone need/want some cilantro?  I bought too much...  ^_^;

      Ok, I am the schmoe who helped the crazy customer out. I have bought into the Book-A-Million pledge so much that I helped a customer out even though she was crossing over into our world. She had crossed into our Book A Million realm of existence and WE DID NOT APPROVE!  Not only did she cross those barriers which we THOUGHT we to never be crossed by the "evil doers," she actually had the audacity to ask me not once, but twice after I had already told her that "No, we do not carry BR Business Report," whether or not we carried any local magazine or newspaper other than "the little Baton Rouge newspaper."  To my defense though. As she rudely barged into our conversation I was so shocked to see a customer in the back that I immediately though that maybe Brett or Jen would know what was going on. I looked to Jen for support and only saw a glazed stare, so I looked to Brett. What I saw was that red face he uses that is usually reserved for "upset Brett" (we all know the one, it's best to stay away when he gets too red like that!) So I took matters into my own hands so I could get her out of there as soon as possible, before anything was said to her that would probably be regretted later.  Nancy would be so proud.

      Jen, Sarah Waters-Baker, and i were in the breakroom. Jen was in the middle of her fabulous routine of Mrs. Sarah Waters-Baker registering a complaint about being shorted eight hours of vacation pay in that hoighty-toighty, upper crust snobbish tone that she is better known for critiquing the quality a bookstore's Curious George selection. We heard someone coming through the swinging door, and we turned to see a goddamned customer. She didn't wander in by mistake. She began to ask where the Baton Rouge Business Report is. Much to Jen and Sarah's credit, they answered her questions as thoroughly and helpfully as they could. However, i was at a slow boil. The words choked in my throat, "Get the fuck out of here you arrogant, intrusive bitch!" I didn't make a sound. I was still pissed off by the time i made it home half an hour later.   They said that the custoemr is one of our serial returners too, which only further infuriates me. We are not a library, and we are not servants to be rousted out of our only refuge to be interrogated on a whim.

      Hi everyone!  While I'm slaving away in the wine country behind a desk and a computer, all ya'll are working at Book-A-Million.  (Relax, relax!  Hopefully I'll be back there by mid-September.  I know you miss my wisdom and charm...)  Anyway, things are going well here.  Along with my Polish counterpart Wojtek I'm keeping the European Union in line.  I make sure they don't screw things up.  No, actually I'm the assistant to the Chargé de mission aux affaires européennes, which means I am the assistant to the guy who is in charge of the people who are in charge of the organization of the funds that come from the European Commission and have to be monitored between 2000 and 2006.  (Like I was telling Sarah Baker Waters, if that doesn't make any sense don't worry because I'm learning as I go along.)  If you guys want to write me a letter or send Joe Muggs coffee or someting...you can mail to the following address:  204B Village 1 Cité Universitaire 33405 Talence France  Well, that's good enough for my first posting.  I'll be looking for those letters and such...

      Check it out:  I'm making big changes, ladies and gents...  I'm pleased to introduce you to the new Bill-- a man of the people.  No more ridiculous muttered monologues or Opus Dei-style self mortification.  I am now "Average Joe Bill" from "Everytown, USA",  always ready with a smile and a hearty laugh.   Bill sans the glasses has been nicer, more considerate of the customer's wishes, and blind.  Two rather masculine females came in on Mon. night.  As always, I asked them if they needed any help: "If you gentlemen need help finding anything, let me know."  Whoops.  Time for new glasses.  Look, if GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO LOOK LIKE A MAN, DO NOT BE SUPRISED IF SOMEONE MISTAKES YOU FOR A MAN.  ESPECIALLY SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE GLASSES. Mi dispiace (that's for Jen).

      I have a great idea, Rachel. If I EVER get a lab job and if it just happens to be at LSU I can get you a student undergrad position in the lab that I'm working in (possibly Dr. Prufer's lab...XX fingers crossed). You'd be working alongside your old buddy Sarah and you'd be getting some lab experience---YAY! and Woo-Hoo?! and Yippie! I can't wait to boss you around and make you do all my work and publish papers in my behalf...no, I mean I can't wait to work with you... :)

      I dont like the rain, because i have to go run inside on a treadmill, and its muddy.  I do like the rain because less fat women with stretchmark arms will try to convince me that i dont need thier driver's liscense to process the return on a magazine they bought in 1967 and have the original reciept for(dont look at me nancy ok'ed the return)  i like the rain because it is condusive to reading and hearing kevin tell funny stories.  hopefully everyone will be relaxed today and not twisted up in some hypertensive cluster fuck at the counter simultaneously looking for a summer reading book and asking me why we dont have the book they need.   Oh yes had this happen yesterday, struck me as funny. As the large woman bore down on me i knew she was trouble, but i smiled and acted the norm all the while thinking OH OH OH FUCK YOU OH OH OHHHHHHHHHH ala Sam Kinnison style in my mind. Anyways....She says she has a discount card and proceeds to not be able to find it, so i check her name last,first i check 3 different phone numbers, (she swears she renewed it within a year) i even check last name and zip code and just last name alone , nothing so she finnaly gives up and goes to WRITE a check. (OHHHHHHH FUCK YOU OHH OHHH) Mam you can just hand me a blank, ill be giving it back to you so you dont have to write it down, "Well i need it for my records, how about that" That was fine except i noticed when she ripped it out they were not carbon checks, and that she was just a stupid bitch. The clincher is, as she wrote it she looked at me, looked around and said "where am I?" OHHHHHHHHHH so you have a discount card at a store yet you dont know what store your in, very nice and to top it all off she would not sign her check slip for a couple minutes holding up a line of customers with murderous looks and pity in thier eyes. I said that she had to sign or i could not continue the transaction, and she said she was just making sure we didnt charge her twice. Finally she gathered up her purse and her bastard child and fled. The stretch marks on her arms will haunt me until the end of my days

      Man, I knew some shit like this was going to go down one of these days.  However, I would have put my money on the old, bald guy who always buys orange juice and wears those nappy, green coveralls.  That guy's got some issues, too.  Mary Kate and Ashley books mixed with Playboys's Lingerie Issue?  I think he's got some wacky ideas running through his head.  If everything goes according to plan I should be in Zurich, Switzerland next week.  My gracious boss had agreed to let me have one week off of "work."  He did finally give me my report back after eight freakin' days!  Now I only have the rest of this week and then one full week after my vacation to finish this damned thing.  (And I don't even think it counts for a grade or anything...)  Well, Tucker Carlson didn't seem to care for Bill Clinton's speech on Monday night.  I would have liked to hear it but French TV doesn't carry things like that.  And I don't have a TV anyway, so I would have been screwed either way.  Howard Dean is supposed to speak tonight...  Where's Jen?  I haven't seen any postings from her lately.  And who is KitsuneRach?  (Note to KitsuneRach, I'm Chris ;o)...)

      Hold onto those aprons, kids....we had an INSANE night at Booka:     While Ben was at lunch, Lisa came up to me in cafe and said, "A woman just came to me and told me that a man in the back of the store flashed her 11 year old daughter and friend. He's sitting by the adult magazines, wearing big, floppy shorts with nothing underneath, and he had his leg crossed over the other. I went back there, but I couldn't see anything. I said to her, 'Ma'am, I can't kick him out unless I see it too.' The weird thing is that this guy was in here one night when Sarah Waters and I were closing. He was back there by the adult magazines, standing with one leg on the bench, his [here Lisa makes hand gesture] hanging out! That's so gross!"     So I shake my head..."Wow, that's terrible, Lisa."...     After Ben gets back, I walk over to customer service to do something. There's a large, built middle-aged man in a furious fit. I over-hear him saying to Lisa, "...What? You don't even have surveillance cameras in here? Call the sheriff's department right now. I've got connections. That guy in the back of the store, you say he's done this kind of thing before?..." Lisa gets phonebook, calls the sheriff, and is on the phone when the guy interjects, "You tell them that they'd better get here  soon .  We're about to have a situation in here!"  The guy keeps ranting and I run back to cafe to start the snow joe.       Thank you, God, for the shift to cleaning the snow joe on Monday nights...I'm glad I was in cafe.     Ben comes to the cafe to fill me in (though I had an idea b/c of Lisa's comments earlier). A guy wearing a red shirt and black shorts, as Lisa described the flasher, then walked around the back of cooking, looked towards the front, and headed back in the direction of the wedding books. I had pictured some dirty old man, but this guy was in his late 20's, also quite large and built. Ben whispered, "That's him!" Crazy....     Around 9:30, the furious father is still at customer service, waiting. The cops are still not there. Red-shirt man starts to walk quickly to the doors. All of a sudden, the father yells, "YOU DONE FLASHED THE WRONG LITTLE GIRLS!!!" and charges at him. There's a flurry of activity as limbs flail and a mixture of Phifer readers, Eric Jerome Dickey books, and decks of cards seem to defy gravity. The dude started to pummel red-shirt; just as I peeked around the snow joe machine, he had him on the floor in front of fiction, kicking him in the kidneys. There was yelling, shouting, people RUNNING to the front of the store. The whole time, the guy's yelling, "Man, I've never seen you in my life! What the hell are you doing?!"     The sheriff guys finally got there. It was the craziest thing ever. And yours truly saw it all. ...Tell us, Sarah W., do you remember the man that Lisa described??

      On Sunday, July 25, 2004, Lance Armstrong became the first person to win six Tours de France.  As the peloton (the group of cyclists) was making its way to the Champs-Elysees in Paris, the officals handed champagne to Lance and the other members of the U.S. Postal team. Then the peloton let them ride nine abreast in the front.  Along side them, in an open field, was a group of Americans in a World War II era jeep, waving American flags and cheering.  Honnestly, it made me cry to see it.  Everyone on the Tour, regardless of their team or nationality, was overcome with emotion to witness and be a part of this historical moment.      One of the first things I'm going to do once I'm back in the States is buy a racing bike.  I've promised myself to get in shape and ride my bike across parts of the country.  Wouldn't it be fun to see the U.S. on a bike????

      Has anyone noticed the decided lack of tree frogs in and surrounding Tiger Land? Back home (both homes...Eunice and Slidell), the froggies sang a virtual symphony every night. Now I'm lucky if I hear one when I park next to the one (1) tree by my parkinglot. I was thinking this serious lack of frogs could be the result of air pollution? Seems as though they'd absorb the toxins through their skin...

      Sarah, I just wanted to let you know that I'm very happy that you got a neat job at LSU.  Good for you!  However, I'm sure you'll be missed at Book A.  If you have time and you feel like doing it, I would love to have all the measurements of the Southern Pecan Decaf, but don't break your neck or anything.  Ha, ha, ha...;o)  Brett, I had no idea that those bastards slaughtered all the Cathars!  I'm terribly upset and appauled at their terrible behaviour.  They shall all be sacked forthwith!  Hey, I'm going to have to learn to drive on the "wrong side" of the road in August when I visit Ireland.  Weird!  Jen, when are you going to finish your degree at LSU?  Will you still be there when I get back?  I still have your Doves CD and that Chantal Krwvasnivichstein thing, too.  What's wrong with the Red Sox?  The Yankees are ripping their balls off...I hate the Yankees!!!  To every one else that I don't know yet, I look forward to meeting you upon my return to the Red Stick.

I now work for the state of Louisiana at the Louisiana State University Neurobiology Center (in the Lion's Eye Center).  :)  I start tomorrow (Wednesday).  I have to cut out baby  mice brains  for cell culture.  I will also be doing a lot of microscopy and imaging for the lab.  I get paid an annual salary of $25,000 and will probably get to go to grad school in the near future.  I will be working for a Dr. Xia (how do I pronounce that...

      This past weekend was awesome!  I went to Carcassonne, which is a small southern French city near Marseille.  The reason for my going there was to see the Tour de France up close but I had a great time visiting the city, too.  There's a huge walled city/castle up on a hill that dates back hundreds and hundreds of years.  (It's ten times bigger than a Medieval Times restaurant, one hundred times cooler and it's real!)  When I wasn't sight-seeing I was hanging out in this one bar with the other Tour de France fans.  I met some New Zealanders and some Scottish folks.    Then on Sunday I got up very early and staked out my spot on the side of the road to see the Tour.  At around 12:50 all kinds of offical cars came zooming past me and then just a few seconds later the riders crested the hill and whizzed past me in an instant.  It was so awesome!  I saw my favorite French team, Brioches La BoulangÃ¨re, and the current Maillot Jaune--"yellow jersey"--Thomas Voeckler.  I cheered him on and he smiled back at me.  All in all it was great but, of course, it only lasted about three seconds.  So I watched the rest of the race on TV with the old French guys in their usual bar.  Some old dude who must have been drinking since earlier that morning came over and asked me something incomprehensible and I just muttered back "je ne comprends pas."  And when he asked me if I didn't understand French I told him that I spoke French very well but that I didn't understand his drunk ass--but politely, of course.    Internship update: only four weeks left before I go to Ireland and finish this damned thing.  I should be back in Baton Rouge and in my black apron by early October.  Get that Southern hospitality coming...Oh, and some Southern Pecan Decaf would be nice too...  LeCastor

I have to drive across the world to get there though. And I have to wear a freakin' hairnet (and earplugs at certain times when I'm not in the lab)... I have a really nice hairstyle after wearing one of 'em all day--- Jen I have a hairnet for ya cuz I know you want one!  Well, I have to go to bed now. Cuz I am tired.

      Okay, I do not have a lot of time so I'll make this as brief as possible.  For years I have had a theory that I am actually a "weirdness magnet".  I have not been able to systematically test this theory until now.  Europe has proven it: I am the nexus of weird.    -Franco-Swiss goths. -Israeli Vegans -Street People -Drunks -Archaeologists   They FLOCK to me.  I need to start recording all of this in a neato scientific looking notebook.  That's right.  European keyboards are different.

      Hey,  Well, it appears that I must get married pretty soon to keep up with everyone else!  Shit!  I gotta find me a woman first.  ;o)  Apparently, as H2O pointed out, my picture didn't get posted as I had planned.  Screw it!  It doesn't matter anyway.  Suffice it to say that the meeting was pretty damn boring.  And as my buddy Wojtek says, "it was like a 'czeski film.'"  (like "it's all Greek to me.")  So I saw "Super Size Me" yesterday and man was it good.  I'll NEVER eat MacDonald's again!  (Well, maybe from time to time...)  But never for a month straight!!!  Tomorrow is the opening day of "Fahrenheit 9/11" in France and I plan on going to see it, too.  Just great, two films that make the States look bad...Oh well, I guess we all have our downfalls.  So Kerry-Edwards, eh?  I sure hope Bush and friends don't get "re-elected."  They have done too much to make us look bad throughout the world.  But there isn't much anti-Americanism here in France, which was a pleasant surprise.  The media makes it always sound worse that it really is, you know?    Okay, I guess I'll sign off for now.  Remember to look for me on the sidelines of the Tour de France on Sunday, July 18th...if you guys are watching the Tour de France...on Outdoor Life Network...if that exists in Baton Rouge...or if you even care...okay, I'll shut up now.

      Right?

That very much sucks. It didn't cross my mind that there was no one to substitute her shift. Why couldn't Ben do it?   And who is in Sunday morning? Sheesh....   I hope it all went well.

      Hey ya'll,  I just got back from a week-long vacation in Switzerland.  I found the countryside absolutely gorgeous and the people just as nice, if not nicer.  Zurich was fantastic and Schwytz was very quaint.  Geneva, on the other hand, was not the highlight of the week.  I was propositioned by a prostitute and realized that I was in the "quartier chaud" of the city--aka, the red light district.  Whoops!  One week left of my internship.  My report is almost finished and my bags are practically packed and ready to be taken to the train station.  I'll be in Paris on Friday afternoon and then it's off to Ireland on the 17th.  I'll finally be back in the US on the 25th of August.    I've applied for a good job in Madison.  Won't know anything for a few days...or a week even.  But it pays well and it'd be a good step in starting my career.  We'll see what happens.  I'll fill you in as soon as I know anything...
