      I Thought  Verse 1 I remember all the good times we had Some of them good and some of them bad When we fought I was so sad And then you made me mad  Chorus 1 I thought you had my heart But instead you just tour it apart I thought you were the one for me But thats only what I believed  I thought we had a good life Spending time with each other everynight You would hold tight And you told me I brightened up your life  Verse 2 I believed every word that came out of your mouth But I just couldnt see what you were all about What you were talking about Cause all you did was lie And that always made me cry I felt like I wanted to die But thats only what I felt inside It was something I just couldnt hide And something that everyone found  Chorus 2 I thought we had it all But I just happened to fall And you werent there to catch me You werent there to hold me So I fell So I fell Fell so hard But didnt get far

      Move On  Verse-1 You say you love me But I just cant trust you You think were ment to be But its just not true. Why cant you just get over me. Cause I dont feel the same way anymore But you just wont accept that I only did before.  Chorus-1 So just forget it cause we'll never be togather. Move on with your life It will be much easier. If You just find someone else. You will be happy everynight. But you wont be unless you move on Or you'll be all alone.  Verse-2 Your so confused You need to just face it  Cause its true. Just take a minute to breathe And forget about me. What will it take to get me off your mind. Cause its about time Just open your eyes and you will figure out its not me And you will find someone much better than me.  Verse-3 Just move on. You gotta let me go. Just forget it we cant be togather I cant be yours forever. Why cant you see  I dont want it to be you and me.  Chorus-2 Just go leave me alone Im not someone or something you own. I have a life to Just not with you So move on Theres someone waiting for you. But its just not me So Im just gonna leave. .
