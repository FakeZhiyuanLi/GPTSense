      JXORD is my Final year project which I am doing for my undergraduate degree. The JXORD name is derived from combining JXTA and CHORD. Its a distributed p2p file sharing app based on JXTA and CHORD.  urlLink JXTA  is peer to peer framework and set of protocols supported by Sun Micro Systems. JXTA will enable me to build my, basic communication network.   CHORD will be my lookup service; solving the problem of cutting down the overhead for searching.  urlLink CHORD  is a research project carried by the  urlLink Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems (PDOS)  group at the Computer Science Dept, MIT.  My intial objective for the system will be to :  1. Users to search for files in the JXORD network based on one keyword 2. Download files, after searching them. 3. Nodes can join and leave, maintaing the integrity of the JXORD network. 4. JXORD should be scalable.

      As of today.. things are not going too well with JXORD..  I have given up the idea of implementing CHORD as a seperate module for JXTA.. as I figured CHORD is going to be a core service of JXORD and its a overkill to publish advertisments for CHORD itself.  May be I am wrong..   Pax

       The Matrix and Buddhism   I'm not a fan of The Matrix, but I came across this interesting artical and thought I  should share it with you   Although the presence of Christian themes is strong in The Matrix, the influence of Buddhism is equally powerful and evident. Indeed, the basic philosophical premises that drive major plot points would be nearly incomprehensible without a little background understanding of Buddhism and Buddhist doctrines. Does this force the conclusion that The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded are Buddhist movies?   The most obvious and fundamental Buddhist theme can be found in the basic principle that, in the world of the Matrix films, what most people think of as "reality" is actually a computer-generated simulation. This appears to align closely with the Buddhist doctrine that the world was we know it is maya, illusion, which we must break out of in order to achieve enlightenment. Indeed, according to Buddhism the biggest problem that faces humanity is our inability to see through this illusion.    urlLink [more]

       Gumperson's Law   Ever wondered why, the harder you try to get something, or if you want something really really badly, the more difficult it gets ? Well it can be explained using a very simple rule....   "The probability of anything happening is in inverse ratio to its desirability"   I've been following this rule for some time now, and it seem to really work. But becareful were you apply it !!!

       Westheimer's Rule   For all those ppl who try to be optimistic....  To estimate the time it takes to do a task: estimate the time you think it should take, multiply by two and change the unit of measure to the next highest unit. Thus, we allocate two days for a one hour task  That means for a 9 month project...  9 months * 2 = 18 months 18 months converted into the next highest unit =  18 years   lol  Packs!!!

       Best things in life are free - I   I got my domian name  urlLink upake.com  few weeks back from a domian name sale at  urlLink godaddy.com . I did not have any place to host so that was it... just the domain I couldnt do anything with it, as most of the places charged over 35$ to host the domain and do some considerable.   So screw those hosting guys!!!!  I had all the ingredients, a DSL connection which ran 24/7, a good pc to call as a server and all i needed was to map the domain to my IP. At last i found this kewl place  urlLink afaid.org . They let u do anything with your domian add A, MX.., unlimted subdmomians u name it. And plus they let you update your IP dynamically.. So no worries since I have dynamic IP.   I remmeber paying 25$ at pair just to get a sub domian.. Pair u suck!!!  I say this again "Best things in life are free!!!"   He He I just noticed a kewl new inteface for blogger... Quite clean and simple.. Love it!!!!

       Upaka   Here's how my name came to be ( urlLink Source )   An Ájivaka whom the Buddha met on his way between Gayá and the Bodhi Tree, after he set out from Isipatana for the preaching of the First Sermon. Upaka questioned the Buddha on his attainments, and when the Buddha told him what he had accomplished he asked the Buddha if he were "Anantajina." When the Buddha acknowledged it, Upaka shook his bead saying, "It may be so, friend," and went along by another road (J.i.81; Vin.i.8; M.i.170-1; DhA.iv.71-2). It is said (DA.ii.471) that the Buddha walked all the way from the Bodhi Tree to Isipatana - instead of flying through the air, as is the custom of Buddhas - because he wished to meet Upaka.  After this meeting Upaka went to the Vankahára country and there, having fallen desperately in love with Cápá, the daughter of a huntsman who looked after him, starved for seven days and in the end persuaded the huntsman to give her to him in marriage. For a living, Upaka hawked about the flesh brought by the huntsman. In due course Cápá bore him a son, Subhadda. When the baby cried, Cápá sang to him saying, "Upaka's son, ascetic's son, game-dealer's boy, don't cry," thus mocking her husband. In exasperation he told her of his friend Anantajina, but she did not stop teasing him. One day, in spite of her attempts to keep him, he left her and went to the Buddha at Sávatthi. The Buddha, seeing him coming, gave orders that anyone asking for Anantajina should be brought to him. Having learnt from Upaka his story, the Buddha had him admitted to the Order. As a result of his meditation, Upaka became an anágámí and was reborn in the Avihá heaven (ThigA.220ff; MA.i.388f. Upaka's story is also given in SnA.i.258ff, with several variations in detail). The Samyutta Nikáya (i.35, 60) records a visit paid to the Buddha by Upaka and six other beings born in Avihá. According to the Majjhima Commentary (i.389), Upaka became an arahant as soon as he was born in Avihá.

       Ants inside the Microwave..Experiment   Hum.. I am not going to confess anything... too bad..  But I've notice somethine kewl recently  I usually use the Micro wave to heat up my tea and have notices couple of ants on top of the glass plate survive the couple minutes inside it!! was really curious so I googled it and found this kewl article   "Ants can survive being "nuked" in a microwave? Microwave ovens have patterns of standing waves, with hot, very high-density areas, and cold, very low-density areas. Ants in the oven seek out the cold areas, and dodge the hot ones. If they run into a high-density area, they will survive, because their high surface area to volume ratio cools them more quickly than the ratio of large objects, and buys them enough time to locate a cold spot"   Hum really really kewl stuff here... Maybe its like a merry-go-round ride for them.. I think u should try it too.. But keep in mind not to put any slothy ants.. you could end up killing them..  Before I read this i was gonna put my cat ("Basheeee")... Roasted Cat ????   Pax

       Hi I am back!!!   Aloha!!! Finally I am back.. I was on vacation in Hawaii... Its been Kupaianaha! (refer to a Hawaiian to english dictionary) experiance.... 2 weeks of sand and beach and the women were hoihoi. Aloha `ino! I had to leave in 3 weeks..  Anyways enough abt hawaii, my blogging is a bit rusty and few changes have occured while I was gone..   Whats quite significant is that "Sloth" has found his match...well its interesting to see someone going through the horrors of meeting his/her first love, for a fact "Sloth" has been less mobile today.. cos he's afraid he will run into this girl...  Sloth I know you want my advice... Here's are some pickup lines I learned in Hawaii..   Aloha!!! nani, u` i kaikamahine  "`O wai kou inoa?" `O Prem ko`u inoa. No hea mai `oe? No Dehiwala mai au.   K.. I m off.. till next time  Pax
