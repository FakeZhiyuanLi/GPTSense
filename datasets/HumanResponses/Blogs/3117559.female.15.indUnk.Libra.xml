      okay, so i asked for my parents' permission to attend the party. they said yes.i was kind of excited. i told malcolm dat i was goin but now, ym said that i cant go cause im not a member. wtf? i shouldn't have believed her. i shouldn't have asked my parents.damnit. nvm nvm. its okay. he's offline now and i can't tell him dat i can't attend the party tomoro. dats embarrasing. will he wait for me tomoro?will he said dat im just lying to him? hell. maybe he wud think dat im just a fkin liar. oh well, i think i'll be with him some other day. alone. just the two of us. but im kinda sad to kno dat i cant go. sad. but hey, this happens to me ALL the time. so.. maybe im used to it?.. i dono  im bored. i dono why malcolm's always busy. or am i just boring. jeez. we have nth to say to each other. not even the three words dat make me smile. he always replies minutes later. i dono wat is he doin. sometimes im fed up with him. but sometimes, i kno im wrong too. my replies are less than 10 words. its sad to kno dat he's cold towards me.   what the fuck is he doin now. dat asssss!!! why doesnt he call me. he only calls me when his modem's screwed up or smth. and now his modem is okay. and he thinks dat its enuf for the two of us just to tok thru msn. my heart was beatin so fast the last time he called. but i was happy. SO HAPPY DAT I SMILE EVERYNITE WHEN I GO TO BED, thinkin of him. 3 yrs ago when we started this, urm.. 'relationship' he would call a few times a week. dat made me happy :D and we would walk to the school gate together. but now? sigh.. i think he's just my cyberboyfriend. but i like seeing him at school. AH DAMNIT! I LOVE YOU.
