      (To someone who has more PC skills than i do...this is just the memories copied and pasted with a bit of editing that i made in eddie's thread...and so the comment i made in eddie's memory thread needs to go....ping. Delete. Somehow...please do that...please!) I have a bad bad memory. Gimme a second to come up with a couple of things... Ahh.. The fire escape. The hostage situation. The day eddie writhed on the floor in pain? It started....ah, we don't know. There were people throwing pebbles in that ghey little school garden majig. Then somehow eddie and a variety of his minions got Annie to the top of the fire escape. And Teddie got involved...somehow... And basically there was a hostage sitiuation. And lots of people climbed up the fire escape...And it was kind of confusing. But it went on for the whole lunchtime... till the end. When everyone was on the fire escape, forcing The hostage-taker people down with the hostage. (Well, by that point we were all hostages, but we were WINNING hostages.) And there was much groin-kicking and clawing and biting. And i should stop saying and. Teddie started tickling eddie to get him off the bottom of the fire escape, and eddie whacked into some big black pole thing. And suddenly everyone was off the fire escape, and running away. Mainly because eddie was writhing in pain, face scrunched up, rolling around and shouting 'naughty words'. Tut tut.  Ah, another memory. The shoe incident. Eddie's minions stole Hatty's shoe. After commenting on it's...interesting smell, shall we say, they ran off with it. Threatened to put it in the pond...then ran up the fire escape. They put it ontop of the uh...bit that goes over physics. So we ran up there. Only it wasnt there. And we don't know where it went. So we (being me and annie, hatty refused to move from the wall without her shoe) eventually found them. I got 'the shoes (two gone by now)' off Jamie. Only they were actually his shoes, and he was wearing hatty's shoes. But we got them back...eventually.  Another memory...short one now, i think. Before the geography exam, me and Annie were revising off a big world map which i had lost. And along come elliot, eddie and jamie. Jamie steals the map, and runs around with it. I try and grab it. It tears. We try and slavage it. I ended up with antartica, Jamie with australia and Annie a random part of sea. In the end, the map ended up in various places: A car exhaust, a puddle, a tire.... so on. I blame THEM for getting 19/20 on the world map...  Not mention the apples. Well, the things that were LIKE apples....evil apple clone things...that were everywhere. And the stones....ahh...everything.  -Immy

      These are some more memories.  We had so many nicknames for Elliott! - Ellybert - Munchkin - Bob Marley - Ellybird - Albert - Munchie - Natalie's lover ;) and some others...  One lunchtime Elliott and Jamie were on the run from Newman which wasn't anything unusual and we (Ellybert, Jamie, Emily, Eddie, Tobes and Charlie) were hiding in the apple garden and Newman was on the other side of the fence. He didnt know that we were there and Annie, Immy and Harriet caused a diversion by accident by having to speak to him. We were hidden and then we came up by the fence and we could see Newman who was very close. So we retreated to by the pond. Then Newman moved his position and started walking along the tennis courts. So we had to run so we couldn't be seen but Emily tripped over two new tree stumps one after another! So we stopped running because Newman couldnt actullay see us. Then we decided that Emily and Eddie would go and walk past Newman to see if he was actually looking for Jamie and Munchkin. So they walked past him and he was speaking to Ed, Naveen, Alistair and Robert but luckily he didnt say anything to Emily and Eddie about Jamie and Munchkin, or just anything in general! So we were safe. It was a very funny lunchtime.

      Ah, memories from St Dunstans.  I’ll never forget when Joe did the Matrix in year 8. He was sitting in the back of Usherwood and I turned round, at the front of the class, and flung a pair of scissors at him. They flew straight for them and what happened next I can only describe in the terms of “Doing the Matrix”.  But that wasn’t the last time Joe did the Matrix, the other week Jamie started dashing apples at him in the Playground, and he dodged they all with amazing skill, apart from the last one which finally hit him. I will always remember Joe, and his Matrix skills. ;)  Hmmm, what else? I remember in year 7 when somebody started jacking people books and other stuff. A large amount of it was found out the window I believe. I remember William’s birthday in year 7. He had bought a Coke, to um.. try to be cool, and I just remember William lying in a pool of Coke, with Mark beating him. Haha, gah, the old days. Then Mark ran out of school. I’m glad we didn’t have to endure year 9 with him.  I remember my French-Book-thingy in year 7. It was this sort of black and white A4 booklet; and on the front it had a black and white picture of a Castle. Me and Jake spent French lessons completely  covering  our books with pictures of stick men killing each other. I remember when we got new lockers and the old ones were left in the corner. Once I kicked them and all the doors fell off them, lol. I remember our Latin teacher in year 7; Miss McGarr. We were always late because we had Sports right before Latin, and she always told us off, after of course, she was late herself.  I remember when I was awarded best poet in the year, in year 7. Now that’s something I’m proud of.  There are many other memories from year 7.. when Stuart stole Usherwood’s board rubber, and we started a campaign to get it back.. but I can’t write them all down now.  Year 9 was my favourite year. The things I’ll remember most are, the Belgium Trip- in which I proposed to Clod with Rose’s ring. Lovely girl, Rose. I will never forget the scams me and Toby ran. Or, the times I’ve hung about with Elliott, Jamie, Emily, Toby, and Hugh; those were great times. We mucked about so much and had such a laugh. I won’t forget those apples lol. I won’t forget my form, Usherwood. You guys rock. I’ll never forget you, and all those great times I’ve had with you. There are so, so many more memories from year 9, and if I ever have time, I’ll post them in here.  I’d just like to mention all the people I’ll never forget,  Elliott, Ally, Joe, Toby, Jamie K, Emily, Hugh, Jamie H, Natalie, Naomi, Tara, Catherine, Anna, Jake, Gabriel, Immy, Annie, Harriett, Alex, Josh, Matt, Krishna, Oliver K, Nailah, Sam B, Tedie, Janine, Emma, Alice L, Alice C-M, Lauren, Amy, Clodagh, Cecelia, Ed, Chole D, Sarah, Fred, Rose, Zofia, Annie N, Kasey and everyone else at St Dunstans.  Bye guys, I'll never forget you.

      A day I'll never forget.. my last day at St Dunstans. I'd like to thank everyone who signed my shirt. I'll miss everyone, you guys are great.. the most decent people I have ever met.  Before you ask where I'm moving, we have accepted the offer on our house, but we haven't found a house yet- let alone a school. We may end up renting for a while. We are thinking of moving to either Winchester or Petersfield. Heh, I'm gonna miss London, there's no where like it in the whole of Great Britian.  Anyhow, here are some pictures from my last day, and some I took at school on my phone.   urlLink  Usherwood     urlLink  Some of my mates in my Form      urlLink  Mr Glavin's drawing of me on the board;   annotated by the class.  who ever wrote sexy has the right idea!
