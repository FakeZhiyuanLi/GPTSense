       Mentally I feel alot better than I did when last week when i decided i dont like myself - I have decided i do like what I am and who I have become - mainly because I cant imagine living my life any other way.    &nbsp;  The sum of all my previous decisions and actions has led to me being the man I am today and in 99% of cases I have no regrets about anything i have done.&nbsp; For me its not how I end up in my life its how I get there, this quote sums it up perfectly -    &nbsp;    "It is good to have an end to journey toward, but it is the journey that matters in the end."      &nbsp;  Well I am glad to have gotten that off my chest - I just thought people mightlike to know that self-doubt is good but you should never dwell on things too long otherwise you will find you wasting the precious moments we have on this mortal coil     Jon

      Do you ever wonder who you are? What makes you, you?  I am going through a stage of self evaluation - and I dont like who I am.    Frankly I am a mess, 13 years of alcohol abuse running concurrent with nearly a decade of chemical misuse has seriously scrambled my mind, although my memory seems to work too well, it springs little traps on me when I least expect it, bringing up memories that I would rather have forgotten or making me yearn for days gone by, for another chance at those times if you will.  Its scary though, these thoughts usually come in the quiet moments of the night - when you can just let them run as a precursor to sleep - but for me they are coming all the time - i am having doubts about my sanity - thats assuming I was ever sane.  well thats it for now - just needed to get that down somewhere - i cant really talk to people about this - they just put it down to tiredness or stress - or some other such crap...  me i dont know what it is but it frightens me.

                     I am pretty miserable at the moment - nothing seems  to be going my way at all.     I keep trying to make my life happen and, well it  all goes pearshaped, and then nothing gets done and i end up where i started  again.&nbsp; Its just really depressing.&nbsp; I know i need to travel again  (for a major length of time), and then maybe once thats out of my system I can  find somewhere to settle and actually start acting my  age.

      What does the candle represent? Life. Whose life? All life, every life. We're all born as molecules in the hearts of a billion stars, molecules that do not understand politics, policies and differences. In a billion years we, foolish molecules forget who we are and where we came from. Desperate acts of ego. We give ourselves names, fight over lines on maps. And pretend our light is better than everyone else's. The flame reminds us of the piece of those stars that live inside us. A spark that tells us: you should know better. The flame also reminds us that life is precious, as each flame is unique. When it goes out, it's gone forever. And there will never be another quite like it. So many candles will go out tonight. I wonder some days if we can see anything at all.

      If you are in England right now you will understand what i mean by the above title - the weather is bloody awful - rain (and its not even the bank holiday), thunder & lightening, low light levels - feels like winter and its not helping my mood one bit.  I really need a holiday but aint away for ages yet - although the good point is its my 25 birthday on the 13th of this month and on that day Doom 3 also is released for PC in the UK - which is a requested gift on my ever increasing list of wanted items!  I am thinking of New York next may for 2 weeks or so  and maybe Austria snowboarding over xmas - but we will see.  --  The light that burns twice as bright, burns half as long.

      1st let me say PROPS to DrBuggs for the following Vehicle guide for PS  "Ok, Why Vechiles 101.  First of all, the biggest mistake we do is running one by one on foot from some ams/ tower towards a base/tower we wanna attack/save. Why ? Well as a reaver pilot i can tell u why, Roadkill, Roadkill, Roadkill, Roadkill,  Now , if we have to move on foot, at least have the sence to move as a group.  Now , so vechiles saves u a lot of embarasement, ( Roadkill is embarasing  ) Also moving in a vechile ensures the squad arrives at the target as a group, making the fighting efficiency much better, also on the way u might kill some nme roadkill and vechs. Also, if u gun a friends vechile, he is actualy offering to transport u to easy kills, without getting any kills himself. Nice.  The choise of vechs is also important. This influences the tactics to use in the attack, what kinda target u go for and so on.  Lets group the vechiles :  Personal transport -ATV - Mossie - Harraser Fast attack vechiles - Deliverer and all derivatives of deli ( Thunderer etc) - Enforcer/Skyguard - Lightning - Reaver Heavy Attack and transport vechiles - VAN - Flail - Liberator Support Vechiles - AMS - Sunderer ( Many will react to me placing sundie as a support vech, however i never saw a sundie to a jobb a deli could not do better except transport a large squad from point A to A. So, the sundie is our ground based GAL. ) - GaL - ANT  Here are some sentral points about vechs;  Driver should have Engineer cert. If gunner is the designated Engineer, the driver should get into the gunner seat while repairing. If i am repairing a vechile, i make sure i am standing in front of a empty seat. If my gunner the calls out Cloaker/Aircraft etc, i can quickly get inside the vechile and take cover, while switching Glue gun for weapon in my inventory. If need i can then go out a kill the infiltrator / Whatever it was or drive of so my gunner can get a clear shoot at the danger.  Fast attack Vechiles :  Fast attack Vechiles can kill Heavy Attack Vechiles. However this takes coordination between gunners and driver and a good driver. Most light and fast attack vechiles get killed b4 the gunner realises they are under attack. We had a nice Flail kill last nite. A thunderer with two gunners drove at full speed towards a flail while Sig Sagging. At 15 m range we sirkeled the flail at top speed, the turret on the flail could not turn fast enough, and b4 the gunner had realised his mistake the flail was dead. ( No matter the 4 reavers that killed us right after  )  Fast attack vechiles can also kill base turrets. There are two approuches.   1. One is to keep your distance at a place were u can quickly take cover, With Good gunners u kill a turret b4 u run out of armor, run away and repair. 2. Fast approach, Drive at full speed up to the wall and towards the turret. There is a point were the turret cant hit the vechile but the rear gunner can hit the top of the turret. Its important that the gunner does not trigger the turret by firing at it while approaching at high speed, it always takes a few secs for autotrigger to trigger the turret. A good gunner driver can kill all turrets in a base without getting hurt at all. Of course if there are NME defending it might not be quite that easy  Base attack by fast attack vechiles, Load up your fast attack vechiles, use the speed to punch straight to the backdoor, dont stop or slow for anything. First person to embark at backdoor does emp, hack and enter.  Ill write more spesific about the vechs later."  Hope noone minds me posting this thing here - but i spend alot of time on my blogs so i can read it at my leisure on here more easier than the forums --  The light that burns twice as bright, burns half as long.
