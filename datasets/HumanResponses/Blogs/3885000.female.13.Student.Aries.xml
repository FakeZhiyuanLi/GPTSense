       Oh my god how boring can life get?I don't know.I wrote myself a lot of songs recently maybe one day Ill post them on here but I don't know about that.I am very excited because I am going to camp this saturday for a week in Merritt but what makes me mad is Parents they are getting all mad because I haven't gotten packed no......I am almost finshed packed maybe its because I haven't been doing dishes for awhile.I dont care and maybe its the fact that thye have to pay $130.00 dollars.I haven't been&nbsp; allowed to do much recently.Felt like dying yesterday but of course I didn't.

       I have been so busy.Its like theres no stop.I have been to Port Alberni recently and I saw my cousin Rebecca.We talked to Kyle and Charles(Charles for only 5 minutes)It was pretty cool.Rebecca turned on webcam it was on me aLOT!I went to Victoria yesterday.Gone to the waterslides but they sucked.I had to push myself all the way down.The best part about that was the tube rides.wheee.Also went to the Royal B.c Museum and visited the Enternal Egypt exhibit.Boy oh Boy it was pretty intresting.The dead 10 year old boy mummy was pretty gross.Its like I could have nightmares.hehe.I got a new kitty named Banaya.i havent really gotten into the whole new cat thing.I still think its pretty soon to get a new cat after our other one ran away well escaped.McDonalds Quarter Pounders are truly gross.You can taste the grease.It was pretty sickening.I made myself a song last night titled Try by Rachel Volkman.Its pretty cool.I gonna go fly.later

       I have to go home soon.Its going to be crazy.My brother and his friend is over and when he is over they go bonkers.They don't even leave me alone.I might go for a bike ride later.Away from everything and everyone.I really need to.I hate how parents just think they understand us when they don't.Their strict and they just wnat to keep you forever.I am so confused right now.The guy that I like is really pissing me off.Some times he'll talk to me then sometimes he just avoids me.I shouldn't even be liking him.You see I am thirteen and hes like how old?Anyways Im stupid for likeing guys who are older than me  and never see me as anything except maybe a younger friend.I don't evn now if I like him.I think but then again I just don't know.I am confused .This whole guy/girl thing is crazy.I mean at this age you have to be a slut or a bitch and to show your boobs,belly and booty just to be liked.If you don't have big boobs chances are they won't like you until highschool.RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONFUSING!!!

       Am I really that simple minded like I was told.I don't think so.So I was laughing about Mr.Duffy is Fluffy and very puffy.I only act that way around Caitlin not around everyone else.I rode my bike to the library to go on the computer because My computer at home is so old that it is a dinosaur.I checked my emails which was pretty much unnecessary and I wanted to work on my website which is quite fun.I got books but i don't know when I will get the chance.Went downtown earlier and bought a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't need.My mom wants me to throw out  a bunch of things but I can't all have memories or I might need them.I get to watch a movie tonight Secret Window.I already seen it.But hey its a good movie.Next year I am joining Air cadets.It might be scary.I don't Know any one in there like The time at the 70's Dance Meagan helped me not be scared but that was totally diffrent.I am not know anyone in there.I want to finish my Guiding years and quit papers.Everyday when I have to do it I get pissed off because the papers fly off or they get wet and then they don't even care that you take time out of your day to deliver papers.Then I might have to quit the youth events committee but if I do.I want to thank all of them for what they have done.Crystal and Meagan will be leaving because Meagan's going to finland and I think crystal is going to college.I can't believe Natasha joined when she did.Everyone was like Oh god!!

       Glad to be in Parksville.Away from tourists and traffic jams.No more torture car rides with the un-wanted.On the trip I learned to be more patient and good things happen to those who wait.Today on the bright side I made myself a website and got to be with friends.Ate chocolate bars and drank pop. Decsions,Descions,Do I want to join air cadets and discontinue the youth events committee?I'll decide eventually.I've always wanted to go party but i havent.I just dont have the chance.on my trip I got myself some shirts and stuffies.I got to play tourist.wheee.A week and a bit I get to be away from the 'rents.Thats gonna be awesome.Im babbling like a long gone fish so im going to stop.
