       B-Logs: The Business Blogs Paradox    urlLink HindustanTimes.com  discusses the effects of technology and blogs in particular. According to the article, Blogs are 'a direct, one-to-many vehicle for communicating ideas'. What makes them disruptive in business application is that they allow businesses - which are after all human -- to communicate with a human 'real voice'. On the other hand,  urlLink Webpronews.com  discusses the idea of corporate newsletter publishing via blogs. I found the idea very pragmatic and futuristic. Way to go !!

       Bohemian Rhapsody : Is it??   I have just come back to my room from the  urlLink IIT  coffee shack. The place, where we have shared laughters and joys, sat for long hours over countless cups of coffee and maggi and chat sessions. Where we have shared our thoughts and fought over stupid topics discussing them passionately. I have just come back from that very place, but with thoughts and feelings so different from what it used to be.  Today the laughter has given way to a look of tension and frustration on everyone's face. "Its so frustrating. There is no job. I am applying everywhere. No vacancies." And then on the next table you hear, "I am planning to go abroad on a scholarship. The job scene is really bad and I don't think I will get a nice job. Going for higher studies is the only option left in front of me." And then a person comes who does have a job. Meeting him, I congratulate him. But he is too irritated with the job he got. The job is in a core engineering one, in a chemical MNC, but the pay is a punitive six thousand bucks; the only perk being free accomodation in some small village-town.  There are ruminations galore, about the uncertain futures. About the decisions made. About the hard work, before and during IIT years. And to end thus, with a degree in hand but no job to do justice to years of hardships and hardwork, and that too when you are the product of one of the best institutes in the country. It gets too disappointing.  I only wish those people, my dear friends, good luck !! May serendipity happen !!

Read the full article  urlLink here .  A strong board of directors can make the difference between success and failure for a start-up company. And, an effective advisory board can help one recruit those directors. Specific examples, indicating the tasks a board can accomplish and the skills it can bring to them, make this article particularly enlightening. The  urlLink article  can be assumed to be a Business 101 course :)).   Further, here is a  urlLink business plan  guide.

       Multiple Interviews for One Job: The present-day scenario.    urlLink csmonitor.com  published an article on the 12-step job interview. There was a time when the recruiter took 20 minutes to size you up and skim your résumé before leaping to his feet and barking, 'Kid, I like the cut of your jib. Welcome aboard!'. It makes an interesting reading.   But today, with employers comfortably ensconced in the labor-market driver's seat, hiring decisions based on instinct are practically unheard of. Indeed, it's not at all unusual these days for a candidate to be grilled by six, eight, or even a dozen interviewers on various rungs of the corporate ladder as part of the overall screening process, say human-resources executives, headhunters, and other experts in modern hiring practices  "Many companies have made bad hires; now it's their market, and they're determined to find the people they want," explains Marie Raperto of the Cantor Concern, a New York City recruiting firm. "Even someone seeking a mid-level job has to be prepared to go through six or seven interviews," she adds. "It's endless."  "You can't even get nine people to agree on where to go for lunch," he adds. "How can you expect them to agree on a person?" But in an age where companies routinely boast about their teamwork ethos, nonhierarchical cultures, and commitment to "cross-functional" collaboration, it's easy to see why consensus now plays a major role in hiring. Many companies known for attracting top-flight talent say they believe that gathering a wide variety of perspectives is essential to ensuring that the right person gets the job.  Problems with group hiring arise when junior staffers or peers are given veto power in the final decision, says Bob Woodrum, a partner at executive-recruiting giant Korn/Ferry International. Recounting a recent incident in which a candidate was dismissed by a Fortune 100 client despite having favorably impressed 11 of 12 interviewers, he notes that "everyone has a different agenda," and that such agendas - whether personal or political - can conflict with the organization's best interests. "This was a case where 11 people had said, 'This guy's a hire.' But one person said the candidate wasn't enthusiastic enough, and that was it."  Read the whole article  urlLink Here .

       Origami Boulders   I came across this hilarious site selling Origami Boulders. Origami is a Japanese art of folding paper. What they are selling is wadded up paper or something like that. The amusing part is the sarcastic way. Interesting are the dealings with the post office and banks. The site promises free shipment (though God only knows who would like to order wadded up paper). Its a laughing riot all the way. Check it out. The site title bears the name  urlLink Origami Boulder Company -- Original Origami Gifts! . Check out this excerpt from the site:  "Site is real. You order and you really get origami boulder artwork with special card to display at your home or workplace. Make good unforgettable gift for friends!  You buy wadded paper boulder and keep it. Or send many to your friends as very nice gift that no one ever forget! I include special card with every order that explain work of art. You buy 20, I send you free extra one with special message from me!  Hurry up and order now!  I send you wadded paper with Priority Mail. It is fast with nice free box from Post Office. Post office worker tell me, 'Don't take so many free boxes! You must order them online from USPS! Other customers mad when you take them all!' I laugh and yell, 'It says free, bureaucrat!! What you expect, dumb dumb?'  Update!!!! Wall Street Journal article on 5/29/02 say that Priority Mail is ripoff and doesn't arrive faster than First Class mail. This is outrage from post office lazy people. I complain today at post office and they laugh and pretend article isn't true. Who you believe, slow postman or Wall Street Journal? Now maybe I buy special boxes and send First Class instead of wasting money on Priority Mail. I make most efficient decision for customer benefit.  My friend is graphic designer for big company. She design page for me because FrontPage too hard for wadded paper artist!  I change design and she send email that says, "you've ruined my beautiful site!!! :O( what in the hell is up with origami boulder?!?!?!?!"  I tell her, "You designer, not site owner! I change whatever I like. You get paid, didn't you? Then go away now!!!" Her design have too many pages and Jakob Nielsen say Internet people too lazy to click so I make everything one page.

       Seth Godin   Came across the blog site  urlLink Seth's Blog . Seth writes in an iconoclastic manner, complete with tangential thoughts and lateral humor; thus living up to his strature of the ultimate entrepreneur of the year and a marketing guru. I think this blog is going to be added in my everyday-visits site list. Check it out. Its amazing. Herez an article from his site, that he posted:   Naming a business  Greg Harrington writes, "I’ve been thinking quite a bit about a topic lately—how to best name a business—and in looking for some ideas, I’ve reviewed several of your books, but don’t find anything in the way of a thorough treatment of this topic."  Here's what I think: First, the main point: a brand name is a peg that people use to hang all the attributes of your business. The LESS it has to do with your category, the better. If you call yourself International Postal Consultants, there's a lot less room to hang other attributes. Some names I like? Starbucks. Nike. Apple.  Second, please pick a real english word, or a string of them. Axelon and Altus are bad. Jet Blue, Ambient and Amazon are good.  Third, be sure it's easy to spell AND pronounce. Prius is a bad name. I can't tell anyone to buy a Prius because I'm embarrassed I'll say it wrong.  Fourth, don't obsess about getting a short web name. If you want to name your venture capital firm Nickel (a great name, imho) then you could have www.NickelVenture.com and that would be fine. The only way this turns into a problem is if the current owner of the URL is a competitor (which won't happen if you pick a non-obvious name, as I write in #1 above).  If you follow these pieces of advice, you'll discover that there are literally millions of names available to you (lemonpie, for example, is perfect for a scuba tour company. So are orangepie, melonpie and kiwipie). You will have far fewer trademark hassles. You will have no trouble coming up with a cool name that means nothing and makes it easy for you to hang a good brand upon. And you'll have fun.  BUT, don't forget to come up with a great tagline. "lemonpie, the easy way to learn scuba," for example.  PS a couple more tricks:  1. Use a stock photo CD and find cool pictures that match your name BEFORE you pick the name. If you can find a bunch of $30 images that work with a name, grab the pictures, then the name.  2. Don't listen to anyone else. All your friends will hate it. GOOD. They would have hated Starbucks too (you want to name your store after something from Moby Dick!??) If your friends like it, run.

       Schools of the Future    urlLink Ode  Magazine's latest issue sports an article written by the famous  Ben Okri  on the "Schools of future". He writes that in the future, centres of learning will teach at least one thing we do not teach today: the art of self-discovery. There is nothing more fundamental in education. We turn out students from our universities who know how to give answers, but not how to ask questions.   A really well written article. I hope we would analyse the shortcomings mentioned there, and strive to improve the educational models we currently have, imbibing new ideas and new paradigms into our present systems.

       IT Firms Slash Entry Level Salaries    urlLink Economic Times  reports that though most companies are moving towards performance-linked compensation packages or a variable pay model, industry estimates suggest that entry level salaries have been cut by 20-25% across major companies. Even as this happens, companies are rewarding top performers by increasing their pay. “While companies in the US selectively reduce salaries to fund the bonus pool, companies in India are also following suit,” said a CFO at a leading Indian software company.  Though it is not known whether a 20-25% cut in entry level salaries would be enough to fund bonus reserves and other allowances, sources in top rung companies state that since the measure will be across the board, it would lead to substantial benefits.  The market is looking forward to the first quarter results, beginning with MphasiS. Infosys is slated to announce its results the next day. “All eyes will be on Infosys, which has taken strong measures to further cut costs. These measures, which include cuts in entry level compensation, onsite rationalization of salary-related allowances and a focus to shift work offshore, would reflect in the coming quarters. But the cost-push pressures from offshore salary hikes could be more immediate, when seen together with a weakening dollar and rate declines,” an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities said in his report.

       Net Profiling Visitors : The New Marketing Strategy    urlLink William Gibson , the author of the award-winning book  Neuromancer  where 'cyberspace' and 'cyberpunk' debuted, has come up with a new book. Its called Pattern Recognition. Again the timing of this book could not have been better. Pattern Recognition is about profiling a particular pattern of events or behavioral patterns. How does a person react to a particular situation, or as the latest fad is, how to gain an advertising profile of a person from the material he checks out online. That way he can be shown ads which would interest him.  Various sites are using Net Profiling and Pattern Recognition techniques to know what their website visitors are reading and seeing.  urlLink NYTimes  published an interesting article on Net Profiling. Here is a brief excerpt:   Visitors to The Wall Street Journal Online today will become the latest lab rats of online advertising, as the Web site starts grouping them into classes like "car buffs" and "consumer techies," all the better to serve them ads for Lexus or NetFlix wherever they may roam on the site  Sending ads based on interests usually requires users to register personal information with the individual Web sites. But the Journal Online is joining a growing group of online publishers in adopting technology that can classify users merely by monitoring where they click.  "It is not the way Web sites should be going because it's undermining the very nature of the Web," which offers instant gratification and usefulness, said Jakob Nielsen, a principal at the Nielsen Norman Group in Fremont, Calif., which researches user behavior online. With behavior-based ads, he said, "the challenge becomes, how good can we become at finding out what they want and need? If we do that, there's going to be no need for that disruptive full-screen advertising which says, `We don't care what you were doing, we're going to slam you with this thing.' " Visitors to various parts of the Journal Online will be placed in one of eight categories — car buffs, consumer techies, engaged investors, health enthusiasts, leisure-minded, mutual-fund aficionados, opinion leaders and travel seekers — or into a custom category designed at a marketer's request.  The Journal Online becomes the latest Web publisher to pursue behavior-based advertising. Tacoda Systems in New York provides its Audience Management System to clients like CondéNet, part of the Condé Nast division of Advance Publications; Tribune Interactive, a network of newspaper sites owned by the Tribune Company; and USAToday.com, the Web site for USA Today, owned by Gannett. AlmondNet in New York also offers similar services. And The New York Times on the Web, part of The New York Times Company, in March introduced its own version of behavior-based advertising, developed internally.

       Banking Blues   Internet Banking, ATM accessibility, M-Banking et al. The new age banking mantras. And the banks providing these services are not very old entrants into the banking domain. The customer satisfaction is their only driving USP. And so it happened one fine day. Realising that my old bank was charging me too much for the ATM transactions, and limiting the number of times I can withdraw money from ATM, I thought of opening another account with a "modern tech-savvy bank". It would provide me inter alia netbanking and infinite ATM transactions, the things I need the most right now.  I decided to approach  urlLink ICICI Bank , known for its operational efficiency. I filled the Savings Account Opening request form on their website and after two days also mailed them about my desire to open a bank account. After one week, I received a mail confirming the receipt of my mail to them. A promise to make an immediate follow-up on my mail was made. The email exchange continued for one whole month, with the ICICI representatives making false promises about sending some customer representative to my place to complete the formalities. It was very disappointing to get such a response from a bank, that was topping the best banks list in the country; and the same bank for which the customer satisfaction was the dominant criterion for survival.   After another one week (one and a half months in total), I called up their customer executive who promised me to send their representative right away. After another three days, a guy from the bank finally turned up to take my signatures and a photograph. And now its been full two weeks, since that happened and I have no idea about my account opening status. And that too with a bank, where "you can open an account instantly". Such goes their advertising campaigns.  I don't know if such lapse of efficiency is taking place in my case, or is it the general mode of operability of the bank. My other friends also quote few such incidents; though more complaints are about their ATM cards getting stuck in the bank installed machines.  All this just leaves me wondering, whether I should not mind paying those extra bucks to my old bank, and be sure of great service and hassle free transactions always. Is Old really Gold?

       Investments Galore   I have been reading and learning about investments of late. This came as a fairly new topic to me. Though I had heard about it since quite some time, but its only recently that I have started giving it some serious thought and made an effort to learn about what it is all about. All the nitty gritties of short term investments or LTI for that matter, they all form a part of the bigger whole, the Investment Portfolio and the kind of returns required. All this seemed so Greek to me before.  Here are some sites that helped me in clearing my concepts and understanding the basics.   urlLink Foundation in Finance .   urlLink CNN Money 101 .    urlLink Motley Fool Guide to Investing .   urlLink Investing 101 .  Trust me!! In case you are a working professional and do savings regularly, you should consider investing your money according to the kind of returns you want. Investing money wisely results in much higher interests as compared to the ones you would earn on Fixed Deposits. These sites make an interesting reading and might help you change your mind.

       Einstein's Clock   An interesting article on  urlLink NYtimes.com   What does it mean, Albert Einstein asked in 1905, to say that a train arrives someplace — in Paris, say — at 7 o'clock?  You might not think you need to know something as deep as relativity to answer such a question. But Einstein needed to answer the question to invent his theory of relativity, the breakthrough that wrenched science into a new century and enshrined the equivalence of matter and energy.  In his last step, after a decade of pondering the mysteries of light and motion, Einstein concluded that there was no such thing as absolute time, envisioned by scientists since Newton, ticking uniformly through the cosmos. Rather there were only the times measured by individual clocks. To talk about times and measurements at different places, the clocks have to be synchronized, he said. And the way to do that is to flash light signals between them, correcting for the time it takes for the signal to travel from one clock to another.  A simple prescription. Yet when Einstein followed it, he found that clocks moving with respect to one another would not run at the same speed. The modern age was born.  As Dr. Galison relates, before the advent of factories began to standardize life, and railroad systems with crisscrossing tracks made it imperative to know which train was where and when, there were too many times, one for every village.  In the last part of the 19th century, the coordination of clocks and the standardization of time had engaged the passions of nations, business leaders, astronomers and philosophers. The patent office in Bern, Switzerland, where Einstein worked, was a clearinghouse for patents on the synchronization of clocks.  In New England, the Harvard and Yale observatories were competing to sell time signals to the public, and in Paris pneumatic tubes snaked under the streets to synchronize the city's clocks with blasts of air. Far from being a bit of abstraction by a loner genius, the clocks that Einstein used as examples in his papers were as familiar then as computers are today.  That is one of the messages of Dr. Galison's new book, "Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time," due out in August from W. W. Norton. Part history, part science, part adventure, part biography, part meditation on the meaning of modernity, Dr. Galison's story takes readers from the patent office to lonely telegraphers sitting in the rain in the Andes, from the coal mines of France to town councils in New England as it circles around the exploits of Einstein and his rival, the French physicist, philosopher and mathematician Henri Poincaré.

       Sniffers: Old tools New Methods !!   Hacking and Cracking. These terms date back to the same time as computers and internet. New methods are continuously developed and old ones refined. A sniffer is one of the most offensive weapons in the hands of a hacker who wants to monitor a network. So much so, that Matrix-II (Matrix Reloaded) also shows Trinity working with a kind of a sniffer n scanning software Network Mapper (NMap) to hack into the systems. I read somewhere that Fydor, the creator of NMap, a fellow of the hacker/cracker brethren, was seen dancing in a cinema hall after seeing his designed and written software being featured in the movie and shown working successfully. Here is a small introduction about the Sniffers written by  urlLink Robert Graham .  A sniffer is a wire-tap devices that plugs into computer networks and eavesdrops on the network traffic. Like a telephone wiretap allows the police to listen in on other people's conversations, a "sniffing" program lets someone listen in on computer conversations.   However, computer conversations consist of apparently random binary data. Therefore, network wiretap programs also come with a feature known as "protocol analysis", which allow them to "decode" the computer traffic and make sense of it.   Sniffing also has one advantage over telephone wiretaps: many networks use "shared media". This means that you don't need to break into a wiring closet to install your wiretap, you can do it from almost any network connection to eavesdrop on your neighbors. This is called a "promiscuous mode" sniffer. However, this "shared" technology is moving quickly toward "switched" technology where this will no longer be possible, which means you will have to actually tap into the wire.  To read more on Sniffers, check out the FAQ page at  urlLink Sniffing .

       Microsoft to Shift More Jobs to India   The world's largest software maker, Microsoft, is moving several hundred support jobs from the United States to Bangalore, according to US media reports.  Fuelling the ongoing backlash against outsourcing technology jobs to India, the move has led to an outcry by the Seattle-based Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, which claims that at least 800 jobs will be lost to India. US media reports quote union sources who have gathered this information from current and former workers, claiming that hundreds of jobs will be lost.  Microsoft support centres, part of the company's product-support services division, in Sammamish, Los Colinas, Texas, and Charlotte (North Carolina) are likely to be most affected. Each of these three sites employs 800 people.   A Microsoft Corporation India spokesperson, while declining to comment on the number of US jobs that will now be outsourced, said, 'Microsoft has announced a pilot programme in Bangalore to support select professional products. Over the next few months, we will hire 100 support professionals in India as part of the pilot.'  Washington Alliance of Technology Workers president Marcus Courtney said the information (on moving jobs to India) completely contradicts Microsoft's public position that the impact of their focus on sending work abroad is not going to affect US employees. 'Clearly, Microsoft is starting to cut its US workforce and send work abroad to slash its labour costs.'

       An IIT Every Year  An interesting article on IITs published in Times of India which I read on Swaminathan S. A. Aiyar's site  urlLink Swaminomics . He presents an idea of starting up an IIT each year in India. I think that will only lead to dilution of the present status the IITs hold as the pillars of excellence in education and research in the country. A rat race as mad as starting an IIT each year, would only lead to quantity without quality. And quality is what makes IITs stand out. The quality of teaching, students and professors. You can share your view with me :)). Here is a brief excerpt from the article:   "MANY institutions in India have gone downhill in the last fifty years. But the Indian Institutes of Technology are an exception. They are centres of excellence that are now recognised as world class. Their graduates are grabbed by multinationals the world over, and Silicon Valley teems with millionaires bred in the IITs. The infotech revolution which has suddenly made India a global player owes much to the IITs.  IIT alumni, many of whom have made fortunes in the USA, now want to do their bit for their country. Former students of IIT Bombay like Sudhakar Shenoy of the IMC Group plan to raise $ 150 million to upgrade facilities and faculty and lower fees in their alma mater. Kamal Rekhi, an infotech NRI who passionately wants to repay his debt to India, has talked of raising $ 900million to provide $ 150 million to each of the six IITs.  I am unable to join in the applause. The need of the hour is surely to expand the availability of IIT education, not to make a few ivory towers still more towering. Instead of making the existing IITs richer than ever, may I suggest that overseas Indians should set themselves a target of starting one new Indian Institute of Technology every year."

       AdSense by Google   The popular search engine, Google has introduced a dramatic new contextual advertising service called Adsense. This new program could mean death to affiliate programs on those web sites that qualify for the Adsense program. Why would Google advertising affect affiliate programs? Because Google is making Adsense ads available to smaller content rich sites.  Adsense dramatically simplifies the process of choosing appropriate advertising for sections of sites. Since it's all automatic with Adsense, there is no need to look for content specific affliliate programs which match the content on your website.  Allan Gardyne of Associate Programs penned an interesting and insightful  urlLink article  on Adsense this past week where he mentions this as an issue and predicts the death of smaller or weaker affiliate programs.

       India Turns Bullish in International Oil Market   Just bought a copy of BusinessWorld, the weekly AFFORDABLE business magazine. It was exhilirating and exciting to see the Indian government and government organizations coming out of a shell and fighting it out in International Markets. The story discussed here is the fillip to the oil security intiative being undertaken by India. OVL Videsh managed to pick up a substantial share in Sakhalin 1, the gas fields in eastern Russia, bordering Japan. And that too, when it was competing with international oil giants like BP. The story unfurls a host of channels being utilized, including economic diplomacy et al. This story makes an interesting thriller. Here is an excerpt:   WELCOME to the world of global oil deals — the most thrilling game in town. It is a game that the Americans, Russians and British, and, recently, the Chinese and the Malaysians, have been playing — and one which India has just joined in. It involves picking up stakes in — and ideally control of — each key new oil field around the globe that gets discovered. It is a playing field teeming with sharks — and the Indian players are still minnows. OVL has a turnover of a mere Rs 2,622 crore. The other Indian player, Oil India, is around the same size at Rs 2,000 crore. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), however, has a turnover of Rs 119,848 crore ($25.5 billion), while Reliance Industries, India’s biggest private sector company and the only private sector player getting into the game, is all of Rs 60,000 crore ($12.8 billion). By comparison, the smallest of the global oil giants, TotalFinaElf, had a turnover of $94 billion (2002). The biggest, ExxonMobil, is a $191-billion giant with operations in 75 countries.  That’s not deterring the Indian players though. In the last four years, the Indian quartet has agreed to fork out nearly $3.3 billion (Rs 15,510 crore) between them to pick up interests in oilfields in 10 countries including Russia, Yemen, Sudan, Vietnam, Iraq and even the US.   The whole story is available online at the  urlLink Business World  site.

       Entering New Markets Internationally   Market entry decisions are among the most important strategic choices companies make. Entering any market requires a major commitment of financial and managerial resources, but foreign markets can be especially demanding.  The recent issue of the  urlLink SternBusiness  carries an article on a discussion of strategies for enterning new markets globally.  It says that the majority research on the internationalization process focuses on two factors as the primary determinants of foreign market entry: cultural similarity and economic attractiveness. Many researchers find that cultural similarity with respect to the domestic market is an important determinant of entry, while others have found that market entry decisions are positively related to country size and the levels of development, trade, and infrastructure.   Higher near-market economic knowledge is associated with higher probability of entry. By investing in a small country first and learning about the cultural and economic characteristics of its consumers and business institutions, a firm may be more successful when entering a larger country with similar characteristics.  The article explores the prevailing assumptions regarding the entry of an MNC into a new market, and then further goes on to analyse the most common product domains which have been a success in entering new markets. An interesting article, and the inferences drawn from the study henceforth.

       Direct from Dell   I have been doing a lot of reading of late. Right now, the books on my table are Tom Peter's "The Pursuit of WOW" and Michael Dell's "Direct from Dell". Both of them make an interesting reading. Tom Peter's, as usual, is a fantastic eye-opener. The guru mantras (I know it seems to have a spiritual bent but what the heck ...mantras are mantras ... and he calls himself the business-age guru)... as I was saying...the guru mantras are just amazing ... I notice those small things everyday but mostly didnt stop to look and analyse and derive meaningful thought process and conclusions from the day to day banal stuff. That is where Tom stands out.  Dell too made interesting reading. The way he ripped open his first computer just to see how it functions. And then his entrepreneurial drive right from the tender age of 12. The man ROCKS !!!

       urlLink How to revive investment   Swami talks about the investment scene in the country, which has failed to pick up despite the chronic efforts by various ministers. He proposes an alternate line of thought, a paradigm, which tends to "reduce the shareholding of the government below 51 per cent in public sector banks. Once this happens, officers in these banks will no longer be subject to vigilance (anti-corruption) inquiries when loans go bad. This single step, with all its limitation, can give a major push to investment and industrial growth."  He suggests that the best security for a bank is the "profitability" of the borrower. Yet, usually the lending rules adhered to by the bank ignore profitability and focus on sales, which should not be the  modus operandi .  Citing the last lines, "Some years ago, Yashwant Sinha introduced legislation to lower the government stake in public sector banks to 33 per cent, while retaining management control. Privatisation would be a more thorough reform. But even this half-baked reform has been opposed by the Congress, whose help is required to clear the Rajya Sabha. Dr Manmohan Singh, you must know that your party position on this matter is nonsense. Please end it. "

       A public toilet with TV and newspapers!    urlLink Chalomumbai.com  reports that the luxury of television sets inside washrooms is not restricted to five-star hotels alone. A public pay-and-use toilet in  Govandi  is now offering residents a chance to watch their favourite programmes and also read the morning newspaper while waiting their turn to answer nature's call.   The toilet, managed by Nav Disha Samajit Shaikshanik Sanstha, caters to about 1,000 residents of Datta Nagar, Buddha Nagar, Gautam Nagar and Kamgar Vasahat. It is also frequented by taxi drivers and truckers.   As many as 250 families from the area are members of the public toilet and have monthly passes.  This seems like a really healthy change in the pathetic state of public restrooms. Reminds me of the Tom Peter's repeatedly stressed paradigms about public service and profitability from his book,  "In Search of Excellence" . A small effort leading to a customer (read consumer) centric endeavour is a sureshot winner any day.   More such projects should come up in nearly all the suburbs of the city. And its a sure way to improve the society and make money at the same time, which I am sure no one would mind given the benefits.  Shine on Mumbai :-).

       Your face can be your Password    urlLink The Economic Times  reports that there is a high-tech solution that could render obsolete your growing jumble of credit card PINs and computer passwords -- and it's as plain as the nose on your face or fingerprint.  The concept is based on biometrics -- a branch of technology that identifies individuals based on biological traits. Already, a host of firms including Minnesota-based Identix and Paris-based Schlumberger Smart Cards and Terminals built businesses on military and government contracts. But with costs of raw material, computer chips and scanners plummeting, the technology is moving to the high street.  The USP of this whole biometrics business is the price of the chip and doing away with remembering PIN ids et al. The chip unit costs in the past year are believed to have fallen from £40 ($66.79) to four pounds. This drop in price is expected to attract the interest of cost-conscious consumers and businesses, building the biometrics market into a $4 billion segment by 2007, up from $900 million in 2002, according to recent industry studies.  According to a recent study by Aberdeen Group, large organisations spend as much as $350 per employee annually on computer password management as employees invariably ring the IT "help" crew asking them to reset one of the myriad password codes needed to access the corporate computer network.   urlLink IIT Bombay  currently uses smart cards for login access at the institute computer centre.  Says a student, "As I can login with my smart card on a terminal, leave my work in a GUI running.... Just take out the smart card... go do whatever work I want to do and come back and insert the smart card back again in any comp having those smart card slots, and Voila!! my whole desktop magically reappears... I don't even need to put my password or go through any such login procedures..."   Personally, I find the concept of moving from any terminal to any otherterminal in CC, without having to go through the hassle of savingwork, logout, go to other comp, login, open the work again.  The utility of a single smart card is such an effort-saving process on the part of the customer or user who has to remember a lot of passwords or carry such stuff as smart cards. However, this new application obviates the need for even the smart cards, which till now proved a lot better than having to remember passwords.   So now, imagine a quick scan of your iris, fingerprint or entire face to authorise a credit card transaction, speed your way through customs at the airport or log you onto your computer.

       MIT's OpenCourseWare Project   MIT has come up with a very commendable effort; a worldwide applauded project, called the  urlLink OpenCourseWare Project .  MIT OCW is a publication of the MIT course materials, the best part of which is that the material is freely accessible and does not require any registration. Its a great effort to further the education process by opening up the courseware for the whole world to see. I hope that a lot of Indian universities take cue from this, learn from the method of instruction and teaching at MIT and improve their own educational modus operandi. I am just waiting to see when IIT comes up with the same idea, and I am so sure that the IIT course curriculum would be a toughie for the world to match up with.

       Speech Writing   "The higher you rise in the corporate ranks, the more you're expected to speak on public occasions, and the shorter the preparation time often is. The temptation is to wing it or, if you do prepare something, not to rehearse but to rely on your native ability and good luck to see you through. The sad truth is that when you wing it, the performance is rarely as good in the audience's memory as it is in the speaker's. The reason is that your heightened adrenaline literally makes you feel better--more energy, more enthusiasm, more acuity--and so you rate your own performance better."   urlLink HBS Working Knowledge  begins thus with the article from the book  Blank Page to First Draft in 15 Minutes: The Most Effective Shortcut to Preparing a Speech or Presentation , by Phillip Khan-Pami, a coach and competition-winning speaker himself.   Khan-Pami suggests beginning by identifying your core message:   When you have completed your presentation or speech, what will people remember? What will they take away with them, to apply and change their ways, and one day perhaps even thank you for? What one sentence will correctly sum up your entire presentation? That's your Core Message.   Make no mistake: Your listeners will take away a core message of sorts. They will carry away an impression of what you were saying. It may be complimentary, it may be less so. It may be about you and your delivery, or it may be about your content. If you want them to receive and carry away the right message—your Core Message—you must first identify what you believe it to be and write it down.  The article provides a number of formats to structure a speech:    PREP, which stands for Position—Reason—Example—Position: The idea is that you state your claim (which should sound a lot like your core message) and then give your reasons for it. Follow that with a compelling example, and close by restating your position.     Past—Present—Future, which takes the storyline of your idea and presents it in chronological form.     Problem—Cause—Solution. This structure works well for business arguments and situations. You state the problem—declining sales, say—and then analyze the cause. You follow the analysis with your recommendations for a solution.     AIDA, which stands for Attention—Interest—Desire—Action, works best when you're trying to persuade someone of something. First you grab their attention with a statistic or anecdote or claim that is sufficiently surprising to take your audience away from its concerns to yours. Then you raise the audience's interest by stating the benefits of the position you're advocating.     Tellx3, which, despite its trendy appearance, is actually the most conventional of structures. It stands for "Tell 'em what you're going to say, say it, tell ' em what you said."

       The Red Lobster Story   There are some good marketing lessons to be taken from the news about the Red Lobster executive who was fired for initiating an all-you-can-eat special.   Analysts say where Red Lobster, which is operated by Darden Restaurants Inc., went wrong wasn't in launching the promotion, but in depending on it too heavily. The trick in such situations is to make the rest of the menu -- or the rest of your product line -- appealing enough so the promotion draws people in, but persuades them to choose something else, not the special.   Red Lobster also thought it would cover the downside by charging a higher price for the special. But that just prompted people to eat even more.   In addition to all of this, the seafood market shifted and crab prices went up.   So don't get baked like Red Lobster. Be smart with your marketing ideas.

       Talking WindScreens can prevent Accidents.    urlLink BBC NEWS  reports that an idea is being promoted by Dr Charles Spence, from the University of Oxford, who carried out research using a state-of-the-art driving simulator. He claims that Hi-tech "talking windscreens" used in cars instead of mobile phones could reduce the risk of accidents.  The researcher claims that that the major contribution to an increased accident risk is the distraction of a driver's attention; rather than problems with physically handling a phone. He has carried out many tests, and the drivers found it easier to divide their attention between the eye and ear if the relevant sources of information came from the same direction.  So maybe, in the near future, the mobile phones would give way to talking windscreens. However, I feel one aspect of communication that the researcher did not address is privacy of the conversation with the windscreen via media. Does everyone get to listen in on the conversation or is there a one-to-one module for this medium of communication?

        Cell Phone company Thinks out of the Box    urlLink News.com  reports that in Manila, Philippines, Jessica Gazo has found a job as part of a new long-range sales team at the Philippine cellular operator Smart Communications and that too without sitting through a job interview or even submitting a resume.  Gazo, a 33-year-old housewife who lives 600 miles south of Manila in Davao City, is one of more than 100,000 mobile phone users who re-sell Smart's cellular services through a new prepaid service called Smart Buddy e-Load. With a special $20 chip for her mobile phone, Gazo can transfer bits of air time to her friends' and acquaintances' phones--as little as 55 cents (30 pesos) worth.   Since Smart began the program in May, Smart Buddy has exploded in popularity, giving the company a more inexpensive way of distributing service to the country's poorest, most remote neighborhoods and villages. The first such service of its kind, Smart Buddy marries the latest in cellular commerce with a much older marketing concept of  miniature packaging  that helped bring middle-class amenities to developing countries decades ago.   "It's a good idea in encouraging air time," said Karen Ang, regional telecommunications analyst at Citigroup Smith Barney in Singapore. "It widens the affordability of the product without Smart having to reduce prices."   While Smart said it was unaware of any similar services outside the Philippines, analysts say the concept behind Smart Buddy could help operators expand not only into rural areas of developing countries like   China   and   India  , but among lower-income segments of the population in developed countries like the United States, particularly among teenagers.  It is also hard to find anyone who actually talks on his or her phone. In a nation where the average annual income is less than $1,000, most Filipinos rely instead on cheaper text messaging. " Texting ," as it is known, has cult status in Philippines, and everyone from the poorest student to the loftiest government official uses it. Executives tap out messages during business meetings. When hot news or juicy rumors erupt, they spread like wildfire over the country's text networks, which have become a kind of handheld national chat room.   Offering cheap text helped Smart's largest rival, Globe Telecom, to become the largest cellular operator in the country. But Smart has gradually surpassed Globe, taking a 46 percent share of the cellular market, thanks in part to offering innovative new ways to capitalize on texting's popularity. In addition to financial information, news and celebrity gossip, some of the text messaging services Smart offers are uniquely Filipino. Safe Taxi, for instance, was developed in response to a rash of assaults by taxi drivers. When Smart's customers get in a cab, they can send a message to the company's network recording their taxi's license-plate number. If they do not send a message again within 30 minutes indicating they have arrived at their destination safely, the network sends a message to a friend or relative alerting them to a potential problem.  Smart will not say just how much air time is being bought over Smart Buddy, but analysts say more than a third of the companies' prepaid use is already being carried by the service. For Smart, that reduces the need to print and distribute prepaid cards for calls.   Best of all, Smart Buddy buyers can request such a card from re-sellers like Gazo by phone wherever they happen to be. Gazo says she has one customer who lives two hours away. Selling to distant customers means selling on credit, but Gazo said she did not mind.

       Nokia N-Gage Cracked    urlLink The Register  reports that the security system built into Nokia's N-Gage has been cracked, allowing other Symbian-based mobile handsets to play games designed for the Finnish handheld console-cum-phone.   So claims gaming web site Spong, without explaining how the crack works. But work it does. Siemens phone fan-site ClubSiemens has a series of pictures of the handset running the N-Gage title SonicN.   "The Ngage games runs very well on the SX1," the site reports. "[You] just need to transfer the game file to the MMC and use a specific application to install the game. There is no lag at all and the sound is nice, especially when using the stereo headset. Graphics are perfect, just have to remember to press the hash key to get the game in fullscreen."  This seems an interesting idea though stuff like this might lead to cracking and game piracy. I don't know where this will lead to with respect to Nokia and what measures the company might take to prevent such a thing from happening.

       Ruminations   I am reading a book,  777 Mathematical Conversation Starters  by John dePillis. Its an interesting book with lots of quotes, poems, laws and anecdotes et al.  Herez some of them, and further I will keep updating this page with what I like from the book.  Robert Lee Moore (1882-1974) coined the term "point-set topology". He is well known for his unique teaching method which, some would say, was less than minimalist. Learning by the student and teaching of the student was the responsibility of --the student. Moore's pupils were obliged to avoid textbooks and all other references in favor of "discovery". The result? After 64 years of teaching, Moore's 50 doctoral students include three preseidents of the AMS and five presidents of MAA.   Probability vs. Determinism :   Billiard balls ... are routinely invoked as the model of predictable physics. No one calls billiards a game of chance. All it requires to get the ball into the pockets is a well-measured poke of the perfectly positioned cue.  Dice on the other hand, [are perceived to be] the epitome of chance. Yet billiard balls and dice are both governed by the same physical laws.   So in the final analysis, chance lies in the clumsiness, the inexperience, or the naivete of the thrower-- or in the eye of the observer. In fact, one might perfectly imagine a civilization in which the rolling of the dice would be a sport and billiards a game of chance.   Problem Solving :  Professionals in all areas are expected by their clients to exhibit one quality they are supposed to have in common -- sound judgement. The following story provides an illustration:  In order to solve a persistent and intraceable probem with oneof its new multi-million dollar machines, a company contacted one of its recently retired engineers.  After studying the machine for a few hours, the engineer placed a small "x" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, " This is where your problem is. Replace this part." The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service.  Feeling somewhat put upon, the company demanded an itemized accounting of the engineer's charges. The engineer's response read:   One Chalk mark $1.00. Knowing where to put it, $ 49,999.00.

       Parallel Universe   Wow!! Here is some fodder for thought, and I mean serious thought. I had heard the concept of a parallel universe and all that  urlLink string-theory  stuff which sounded very greek to me. But I happened to stumble on a website  urlLink BBC - Horizon - Parallel Universes  which details the concept of parallel universe. It says that the dimensions exist much beyond the most well known number 3. The scientists believe that there are 11 dimensions and the eleventh dimension is where all the hoopla takes place. It further goes on to say that we are in a tiny bubble which is a part of an infinite membranous bubble structure. And that gravity is just the pull exerted on us by the antimatter or the parallel universe near us.  Hmm, sounds scary but interesting at the same time. Seems like another fiction becoming reality as things get discovered and sorted out. Check out this  urlLink article  as well for more on parallel universe.

       Roulette, Millions in money and A Cellphone   An alleged high-tech roulette scam that saw three people walk out of a London casino with 1.3 Million Pounds recently sounds too implausible even for a movie plot.  Reports suggest that mobile phones fitted with laser scanners can be used to measure the speed of the roulette ball when it was released, in order to calculate where it was likely to fall. The whole calculation would need to have been completed in just a few seconds, as the dealer cuts off betting after the ball has rolled three times around the wheel.  But the trick could be pulled off a lot more simply if the phones were used as stop watches, says Norman Packard, a physicist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, US. Just two equations - one for the ball and one for the wheel, which move in opposite directions - predict the likely area where the ball will stop. These equations comprise only a handful of parameters, including the mass and size of the ball, the shape and roughness of the track, and the tilt of the wheel.

Amar Bhide discusses his book here and also pops out some nitty gritties of starting up your own business. An interesting read and a must for any budding entrepreneur.  The introduction to the interview is catchy itself. Check it out:  "I can't even begin to calculate how often people who are thinking about starting new businesses have asked me to name the one book that illuminates, more than any other, what it's essential to understand in order to create a successful start-up. For close to 20 years now, I've had to answer that there is no such animal. Don't get me wrong -- there are lots of perfectly acceptable books about almost every imaginable aspect of starting and running a new venture, from writing a business plan to raising capital. The limitation of such books is that, important though those tasks may be, you can get them right and still fall flat on your entrepreneurial face."

       Rent a Bike through Cell Phone    Call a Bike is a (relatively new) service from Deutsche Bahn (the German railway company) that’s available in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich. They leave bikes locked up around the city and when you want to rent one you just call the number affixed to the bike with your cellphone, enter your credit card number, and they give you a number that unlocks the bike. You can use the bike for as long as you like, at a cost of 6 cents per minute (euro cents, that is), up to a maximum of 15 euros per day. When you’re done with it you just lock up the bike at the nearest major crossing and get another code that you call in with to confirm that you’ve finished with your rental.

       .mobi domain and mobile phone servers    urlLink The Seattle Times  does an interview with Michael Wehrs, Director of Microsoft Mobile Computing division. He talks about some really interesting ideas which will change the way we use our cell phones. Talk about .mobi domain, using our cell phones as servers, smart phones ... the list goes on. Imagine a phone five years down the line that has half a gigabyte of storage, gigahertz processors, screen technologies and battery technologies that get you at that level of performance through an entire day of use, devices that simply work on whatever area network is out there, and they're smart enough to switch between them. All this is actually being researched and work is going on to make all this possible, and the usual rat race continues to out beat competition.  Some of the fiercest competitors in the business have already hashed out details of the domain project, including Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Nokia and Hewlett-Packard. The effort proposes to create mobile-specific Web sites that end in .mobi or .mbl though it still needs final approval.  Here is an excerpt from the  urlLink interview :   "We're looking at alternate user interfaces. Right now, everybody views a phone as a 12-button keypad and that's all you can really do with it. Some of the newer phones, (the Microsoft) Smartphone being an example, have softkeys which change their function based on what's on the menu. There is going to come a time when there's enough processing power on these devices to actually have a combined interface of input from a keypad but also some level of voice interaction, more than voice dialing.  If you create this new version of .com that will be the .mobi domain, you can do some very interesting things that mobile devices have unique capabilities of doing. Today, you can generally browse through a Web site on your phone but no one can access your phone as a Web server. If you have pictures stored on your device, the only way that you could share them with me is to actually send them to me as a message.    But wouldn't it be easier if from my Web browser I could just browse to your phone and look at them? In order to do those kinds of functions ... I need changes to the way the domain naming systems work. I need them to perform at levels that they currently don't have to perform at.  I think the things that you will see are significant changes in user interface. The idea that you have to pick up and dial a phone probably will be gone 10 years from now. The mode switching between doing a data thing or a voice thing, that will all be gone. You'll generally interact with your device via voice or via screen, but the idea that you're doing either/or will go away. It will just be integrated in.   The devices will become combined and in general much smaller. The idea of personal area networks where devices share their capabilities and leverage each other, 10 years from now that will all work so that you may have a watch that you talk to. You may have just a headset that that becomes your earpiece and microphone. The actual phone will be something in your pocket or in your PC that you have with you, so it'll find a radio network to use and let you connect."

       A9 from Amazon.com   Amazon.com launched its own search engine called  urlLink A9 , thus becoming the latest entrant in the domain dominated by Google, Yahoo and MSN.  Some salient features which might score it on other search engines are:   URL Short Cuts : At A9.com you can search directly from the browser URL box by typing:        a9.com/query   History : Keep track of the last sites visited (on any computer) and your most recent searches. It will keep track of the Web pages you recently visited--even if you switch computers.    Diary : This is the newest and coolest feature. You can take notes on any web page, and reference them whenever you visit that page, on any computer that you use. Your entries are automatically saved whenever you stop typing or when you go to another page.

       Homeless in NY    urlLink CNN.com  reports this story about a college student who says he spent eight months sleeping in a library basement because he couldn't afford campus housing. New York University officials eventually discovered an  urlLink online journal  the student kept about his experiences and relocated him to a free dorm room eventually.  Stanzak, who dubbed himself "Bobst Boy" on the Web site, says he washed in the library's bathroom and took occasional showers at friends' apartments and dorm rooms.

       3 - Dimensional Searching - The Next Stage in the Internet Search Domain    urlLink Wired.com  discusses the new paradigms dealing with the next stage of evolution in the internet search domain. The mind-boggling speed and reach of Internet search engines mask a severe limitation: They are powered by words alone. But the world is full of objects and patterns. Now computing researchers have developed search engines that can mine catalogs of three-dimensional objects, like airplane parts or architectural features.   All the users have to do is sketch what they're thinking of, and the search engines can produce comparable objects.    "The idea of information and knowledge, and retrieval of knowledge, has been something I've been intrigued with for a long time. This gives it a more solidified meaning," said Karthik Ramani, a Purdue University professor who created a system that can find computer-designed industrial parts. Ramani expects his search engine will serve huge industrial companies whose engineers often waste time and energy designing a specialized part when someone else has already created, used or rejected something similar.   With the Purdue search engine, designers could sketch the part they need and instantly see dozens in inventory that might fit the bill. If an item seems close, but not quite right, designers can see a "skeleton" of the part and manipulate it on their computer screens -- make it longer or shorter or curved, for example -- and then query the database again.    So how can computer programs look for objects? The breakthrough is the  voxel . Digital camera owners are familiar with pixels -- the basic element of a digital image. Each pixel is a tiny grain of color. Similarly, a voxel is the basic element of a three-dimensional object that is represented in a computer. Each voxel represents the volume of the object at any given point.    In Ramani's program, for example, stored CAD designs and entries sketched by users are converted into voxels. Then voxel patterns are compared for similarities. Because the voxels represent volume rather than just shape, the program can sniff out, say, a coffee cup, which is mostly hollow but might have a solid handle.

       Microsoft Reaches out to Developers   Microsoft Corp. has recently come up with a new site called  urlLink Channel 9  that combines a host of social networking technologies in a move to improve communications with outside software developers. The site uses weblogs, mobile blogs, wikis and forums as well as other technologies to reach out to developers. The site was created by a group of five engineers and technology evangelists at Microsoft; it was named after the United Airlines in-flight audio channel that allows passengers to listen in on cockpit communications.  The welcome message on the site reads,"We think developers need their own Channel 9, a way to listen in to the cockpit at Microsoft, an opportunity to learn how we fly, a chance to get to know our pilots. Five of us in Redmond are crazy enough to think we just might learn something from getting to know each other."  Channel 9 seems to be all about creating a new level of communication between Microsoft and developers -- beyond the news groups, blogs and the press releases. Microsoft has been pursuing this initiative quietly, and has already been selecting and naming a select group of developers and users as MVPs -- or Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals. Over 2,500 people have been awarded MVP status till now.  BTW, for the uninitiated, Weblogs, or blogs, are personal-journal-type entries on a Web page, mobile blogs are Web pages with pictures taken using a camera phone, and wikis are user-editable Web pages.

       Google Phone   Just read about a new gadget being planned by Google. Its called Google "phone" - a branded consumer appliance that would make it possible to get Google search results and ads almost anywhere. Such a product would extend the company's search service far beyond the desktop computing market. The idea, like much of what the company is planning, is still secret.  Lets see how this idea shapes up for the company. Already, Google is hoping to cash in on the Gmail hype. The introduction of Google IPO is well timed, and is following the new bid-auction modus operandi. Well, there is still time to make final comments on the company, as the whole idea of net search and search engines is undergoing a complete metamorphosis right now. How Google fares in the longer run, is yet to be seen.

       The Perfect PDA recipe   PDA prices and the innovation in bringing out newer models has been falling rapidly with the rise of laptop markets and introduction of tablet PCs. However, some companies are still working hard to recapture the market share, that they have lost out to other digital devices.  urlLink Dana Blankenhorn  has a wishlist for a perfect PDA:   # A keyboard as big as I can make it. You can do that with infrared, so I can pound on any surface and still type.  # A real voice interface. If I can train it to my handwriting, which is abysmal, I should be able to train it to my voice.   # The ability to transcribe recorded notes.  # An integrated camera, so I can snap the picture, do the interview, and get both words-and-pictures for editing when I want them.  # Make that a video camera.   # Tighter integration with all kinds of PCs, especially laptops.  # Integrated cell phones standard.  # Cognitive radio that will automatically use 802.11 or cell systems, whatever it finds.    I put this in my pocket, I take my pictures and short videos, I do my interviews, it transcribes my notes, and I can then use an infrared keyboard to turn that into a package I can deliver through a blog.

       Gmail and Orkut   After receiving an invite through  urlLink Blogger  recently, I joined  urlLink Gmail , the email service from Google.   After I signed up and read some review sites, I got apprehensive and doubtful about whether Gmail was worth using. There were privacy issues and polices being critically discussed. And that was one of the biggest concerns. However, I was delighted to see Google react positively to such qualms and change its privacy policy to suit the concerns of the users. That simply proved Gmail to be more customer-centric rather than just being naive and dull 'another' email service.   The biggest draw is the storage space of 1 Gb that is being provided. I have exchanged around 150 mails through Gmail, and not deleted any one mail till now. The message display is fabulous, and has the display structure just like that of a message board. The reply box is right below the message, thus saving the users time and clicks. Another plus is the search function. You can search all your mail box by entering two or three keywords. I tried it using various combinations and found the search very accurate. A great email service indeed.   urlLink Orkut  is a new community centric site, where you can only join in if you are invited by someone who is already a member. A nice site, with a lot of possibility for business networking and meeting up with old friends. Though there are many sites based on this model, this site has been growing in popularity and user base. I think the main reason is the association of Google with it.  Also in the offing from Google is the "Google Groups". They will be on the same lines as  urlLink Yahoogroups  and the  urlLink MSN  groups. So finally, Google is taking its 'search-domain' competitors head on, by starting services which are the USP of its competitors.  The competition hots up for the internet companies, but that is good news for internet users, who get all the goodies for free. And a whole lot of choices too.

       QuickTopic    urlLink Quicktopic  is a very useful document review site, which allows others to comment on your work.   Imagine that you have authored a document and you would like your peers to review it. This site gives you an instant private space for gathering comments on any HTML document (Microsoft Word documents too). Your group can comment on each paragraph, directly within the document, and you can also display, sort, and print the comments separately. Comments are all in one central place.   This is true collaboration, much better than mailing documents around and having people make comments in isolation. And it's private, but still easy to access.

       Paradigms   Something really interesting that I picked up from  urlLink Seth's Blog . Seth Godin is a Marketing 'God' in his own league. He is the author of  urlLink Permission Marketing ,  urlLink Purple Cow  and the most popular  e -book on innovation,   urlLink Ideavirus  . He is an MBA from Stanford and a very renowned speaker.   "I just finished giving a talk to a group of 400 high-powered (high-leverage, high-paid) credit card execs. As I left the hotel, I passed a much smaller room, where a seminar for local CPAs was going on.  The snacks didn't seem as good. The booklets weren't that interesting either. apparently. But what occurred to me is that the folks in the second room were just as smart and just as talented as the execs in the first room.   The first group was enjoying the benefits of aiming high. They didn't get these jobs because they were arguably smarter or had better connections or had gone to Harvard. No, they were starting with the same raw materials as the group in the second room. The difference, i think, was that a long time ago, the people in the second room had made a decision about what they deserved, or what they were capable of, or what they were going to stick with. And it was a bad decision.  No, not everyone should be a banking executive. But no one who aspires to be a bank executive should sell themselves short because of a decision they made a long time ago. In a world where the past matters a lot less than it ever did before, where it's easier than it ever was to hit the reset button, it's sad to see someone choosing to be stuck. So, if you want to, switch.  Hey, the snacks are better."

      This  urlLink site  is steaming up the anti-India outsourcing propaganda by selling T-shirts like these.          Their site reads, "Help us to pressure Congress and our state governments to stop doing business with companies that outsource their jobs to offshore companies".   Further I came across  urlLink Blame India Watch , a site concerned with the increasing anti-Indian/anti-India sentiment among tech workers, as well as media coverage that focuses disproportionately on Indian workers or propagates anti-India(n) sentiment.   It looks as if the Outsourcing issues are hotting up once again, and this time on the net.

       Yahoo Mail - From 4 Mb to 100Mb    urlLink CNET  reports that the web portal Yahoo will begin offering ' virtually unlimited storage ' for its paid e-mail customers and will upgrade free users to 100MB.   This new upgrade plan is part of an overall enhancement for Yahoo Mail that will launch this summer. Besides additional storage, the service will get a face-lift and tie in more Yahoo-branded services, such as Photos and Messenger. Its being speculated, that after Google announced its email offer, Yahoo sent emails to Yahoo mail customers in hopes of gauging their interest in receiving 100 Mb storage.   The competition between Yahoo and Google continues to heighten. In February, Yahoo dropped Google as its algorithmic search provider and instead launched its own technology. The companies also compete over distribution deals, as evidenced in Yahoo replacing Google search on  urlLink CNN.com  this week.

       Webpage Auto Generator    urlLink StrangeBanana  is a program that creates a random webpage design. The page designs have, usually, never been seen before - they are created programmatically at random. Once you refresh the page, a new design appears. If you want, you can use the design for your own website (in that case you should save it immediately, because when you leave the page, you will never be able to get the same design again). An amusing concept, which ended up making me say, "Kewl" ;-).

       Enum    urlLink ENUM  is a protocol that is the result of work of the Internet Engineering Task Force's ( urlLink IETF 's) Telephone Number Mapping working group. The charter of this working group was to define a Domain Name System (DNS)-based architecture and protocols for mapping a telephone number to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) which can be used to contact a resource associated with that number. ENUM was developed as a solution to the question of how network elements can find services on the Internet using only a telephone number, and how telephones, which have an input mechanism limited to twelve keys on a keypad, can be used to access Internet services. ENUM at its most basic is the convergence of PSTN and IP networks; it is the mapping of a telephone number from the public switched telephone network to Internet functionalities.  ENUM enables Internet-based users to make a selection from a range of services available for communicating with another person when the caller knows only a telephone number or has access only to a telephone keypad. ENUM allows users to access Internet-based services and resources from Internet-aware telephones, ordinary telephones connected to Internet gateways or proxy services, and other Internet-connected devices where input is limited to numeric digits. ENUM enables users to specify their preferences for receiving incoming communications, and gives greater user control over communications. For example, a user can specify a preference for voice mail messages over live calls during certain times of day, or may indicate a destination for call forwarding.   The potential applications of ENUM are far-reaching; however, the principal applications for ENUM have centered on two areas. One is Voice over IP (VoIP) and the other centers on Voice Protocol for Internet Mail (VPIM). The long-stated goal of the VoIP industry has been to make a phone call over the Internet as easy to make and as high-quality as a regular PSTN phone call. The goal of the VPIM industry has been to develop a comprehensive mechanism by which voice mail systems could exchange messages over IP networks. ENUM enables carrier and enterprise voice mail systems to find each other, interoperate, and exchange messages.   Although VoIP and VPIM are the most widely discussed applications, other application possibilities for ENUM, including but not limited to Internet Fax and Instant Messaging, exist.   ENUM has started user trial registrations. I have already got mine :-).

       C.R.U.D.E.    A Charlotte, NC, lawyer purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars then insured them against fire among other things. Within a month having smoked his entire stock pile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost 'in a series of small fires.'   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued... and won! In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with company that the claim was frivolous. The Judge stated nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire, without defining what is considered to be unacceptable fire, and was obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the 'fires'.   After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON!!!! With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.   This is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent Criminal Lawyers Award Contest.

       MyLifeBits Project    urlLink MyLifeBits Project  is an initiative currently underway at Microsoft's Media Presence Research Group, and is directed by Gordon Bell, who was instrumental in creating the first commercial minicomputers in the 1960s.  According to  urlLink Microsoft  - MyLifeBits is a lifetime store of everything. When you are dead and gone maybe your descendants will be able to go thorough minute details of your life, your conversations, e-mail exchanges and the pictures and video highlights of your existence. That's the idea behind MyLifeBits, which aims to record the essence of a person's life on computer disks. Every photograph snapped, home movie filmed, Web page browsed, e-mail scribbled, phone call made or bill paid would be there in the storage space.  There are two main parts to MyLifeBits: an experiment in lifetime storage, and a software research effort. Both of them seem to be the most challenging. Because, firstly, searching this huge chunk of information would be a very task-intensive procedure. However, future technologies might make this possible. Secondly, documenting such a huge information base is a very tedious affair. Our lives maybe on the digital road but there is no way to organise all the pictures, e-mails and documents that form everything about our existence.  Still the project is being pursued with full enthusiasm. Cheers to Bell and his team.

       Digital Photography    urlLink Photoxels  is a nice site on digital photography. There are nice and detailed tutorials on digital photography terminology. Besides this, the site has one-pager format tutorials which give out various tips about taking pictures.  Though the digital camera reviews are not as informative and exhaustive as  urlLink Steve's  or  urlLink DCResource , but overall the site makes an interesting reading and is worth a visit.  My favourite forum site for digital photography is  urlLink DPreview . The site has categorized listings according to the camera models and brands. That makes searching a lot more easier than the usual single forum posting method. I like the ease of usability and the whole concept of the forum site.

       BlogLines    urlLink Bloglines  is a free service that makes it easy to keep up with your favorite blogs and newsfeeds. With Bloglines, you can subscribe to the RSS feeds of your favorite blogs, and Bloglines will monitor updates to those sites. You can read the latest entries easily within Bloglines.   I loved this site. Its a great service that has the advantage of not sucking up local resources, and more importantly, is outside my control in terms of news updates. I don't have to keep clicking the refresh button looking for another seed of info if I have control of my own aggregator, so it's much better to let someone do the refreshing for me. Seriously.Unlike other aggregators which require you to download and install software, Bloglines runs on their own servers and requires no installation. And since my Bloglines account is accessible through a web browser, I can access my account from any Internet-connected machine.  So no hopping over from one blog site to another now, when you can read all the feeds at one place. There is another option of sharing your feeds, so that people know what you read. Besides this, another good feature is the ability to send the feed as email; so the next time you read anything interesting, you can just click on email it and share it with your friends.  The site design needs a little fine tuning, as the three frame model seems primitive. Besides this, people are also advicing them about their revenue models. These issues are just timely, and will be taken care of as Bloglines grows. A great service indeed. Check it out!!

       SpyMac - Another 1 Gb Email Provider   Close on the heels of Gmail comes  urlLink Spymac , the web storage service from Spymac Network. Spymac is the largest Online Macintosh User Group and is developing under the belief that community is the Internet's most valuable resource.  It features an email account with 1GB of space with POP and IMAP access (so you can use it in Mail.app); 100MB of web space; 250MB of picture storage space; Public and private iCal hosting; A Personal Blog, Forum, and Picture Gallery; Customizable Content. And all this is   FREE  .  The question that pops up is, “How do they pay for that?” And sure enough, SpyMac has a section outlining that, right when you register. They are able to make the service free through revenue generated from their Auctions, their Shop, their Web Hosting service, and their Ads.  I have been reading articles and reviews on Spymac and they are not very great. Mostly, user complaints are about the slow email processing, chronic misconfiguration of spymac mail servers which end up causing some days' delay in receiving emails. Spymac is being used mainly as a POP mail account, but I think the picture gallery and blog space might thrive.  Overall, here is cheers to another email service that has opened up the storage space domain and providing the services for free. I think that the only point where they score over gmail specifically is that there is no keyword scanning and hence no advertisements. So the privacy issues are kept at bay and not tampered with.  Lets see how this finally shapes up. For the time being, go get your username before its taken.

They have also sought a major revamp of the American education system, saying it lags behind that of India and China when it comes to technology courses.   Much to the delight of the executives, some Senators backed outsourcing despite it being a politically-sensitive issue in the run-up to the November elections. As Senator Bennett put it: “Let us not be carried away with the concept that trade hurts American jobs.”

       Infosys Does it Again   Professor Sadagopan writes on his  urlLink site  that Infosys does it again – pays out the single largest dividend payment ever by an Indian private sector employer. In the AGM held on 13th June 2004 Infosys formalized its earlier commitment to pay  2,590%  dividend payment, as a special gesture to its shareholders on the historic occasion of its crossing the Billion Dollar mark.   It is one more feather to Infosys cap – the first company to start ESOP, the first to list in NASDAQ, the first to announce quarterly results on time every time, the first to move to GAPP accounting, the first to have international professionals on its Board and compensate them as per global market conditions, the first to hire from “best in class” campuses of Harvard & MIT etc., and the list goes on. It is a proud moment for private sector (in the light of politicians “going back” to public sector, it clearly demonstrates that what India needs is “good” companies, ownership is incidental, if at all politicians are serious they should make “public sector companies” go “public” by serving citizens and not move towards making them serve “private interests” of politicians and bureaucrats).

       Three Cheers    urlLink HindustanTimes.com  reports the story of a rickshaw puller's daughter who cracked the pre-medical entrance exam, one of the most competitive medical entrance examinations in India.   For most of the years that Vaishali Wankhede studied, her family could not afford electricity. She had to make do by studying under the street-light just outside her house. Even when they finally managed to get power connection, she still had to study under the street-light as six other members of the family slept, moved or fought in the barely 20-ft by 15-ft slum dwelling which is her home. Today, having secured around 86 per cent marks in the Pre-Medical Test (PMT), Vaishali's ambition and aspiration have managed to throw back the burden of circumstances. Her mother Maya is a house-help, washing utensils and clothes. She has studied till Class VIII. Her father Ramesh is a rickshaw-puller.   Hats off to the girl who has proved that hard work and determination is what counts in the end. Read the full story  urlLink here .

       IT and India - Questions and Speculations   The fall of Chandra Babu Naidu, the chief minister who had become an icon-figure for IT in India, has led to a speculation of whether IT has failed in India. There are some issues cited by political parties et al for the failure. Some feel IT has NOT created jobs. Many in the left front feel that IT is for the rich. Another argument is that water and electricity are more important than IT. In Karnataka, the argument is that IT only benefits urban youth. Every one is damn sure that India is NOT shining.  Professor Sadagopan analyses these arguments and tries to create a wholesome picture. He writes on his  urlLink blog  that the IT provides a person with a skill set that results in life-long jobs that are well-paying and accessible to one and all, unlike many of the “jobs” that are created by Government Schemes for “3-4 months”. He further talks about the entrepreneurs who had come from poor or middle class families and have made it big.  A good  urlLink article  that can make an interesting case study as well as food for thought.

       Blogdex    urlLink Blogdex  is a research project of the MIT Media Laboratory tracking the diffusion of information through the weblog community. Ideas can have very similar properties to a disease, spreading through the population like wildfire. The goal of Blogdex is to explore what it is about information, people, and their relationships that allows for this contagious media.  Blogdex crawls all of the weblogs in its database every time they are updated and collects the links that have been made since the last time it was updated. The system then looks across all weblogs and generates a list of fastest spreading ideas. This is the list shown on the front page. For each of these links, further detail is provided as to where the link was found, and at what time.  A very interesting project and an equally interesting site.

       McDonalds Experiments with Kiosk Technology    urlLink MSNBC  reports that McDonald's has, in some stores on an experimental phase, eliminated the middle man standing between the fast food lover and his burger, with an advanced test of technology that promises to shorten lines and give consumers more control over ordering. McDonald's, which only recently admitted its service problems and vowed to fix them, is ironing the kinks out of technology some believe will transform fast food the way similar systems have revolutionized bank transactions and airport check-ins.  Each kiosk allows a customer to place an order directly with the kitchen, using a touch screen with pictures of food, English or Spanish text and verbal prompts.  McDonald's is not worried about the loss of the personal touch; it hasn't reduced the number of employees in their stores, but just reassigned them to other tasks such as delivering food. And they are trained to assist if someone struggles with the technology.  Customers like visiting the McDonald's more often now because they don't like to stand in lines and they are not supposed to be doing that anymore.

       Mass Markets - Do they still exist?    urlLink BusinessWeek  reports that now are the days of micro-marketing, and so is the world. Gone are the days, when a single TV serial (the most common mass caputre tool) had a mass market audience which translated into huge profits. But now, the almost-universal audience assembled long ago by network television and augmented by the other mass media is fragmenting at an accelerating rate. The mass media's decline is an old story in many respects; prime-time network ratings and newspaper circulation have been sliding since the 1970s. What's new is that the proliferation of digital and wireless communication channels is spreading the mass audience of yore ever-thinner across hundreds of narrowcast cable-TV and radio channels, thousands of specialized magazines, and millions of computer terminals, video-game consoles, personal digital assistants, and cell-phone screens.  For marketers, the evolution from mass to micromarketing is a fundamental change driven as much by necessity as opportunity. America today is a far more diverse and commercially self-indulgent society than it was in the heyday of the mass market. The country has atomized into countless market segments defined not only by demography, but by increasingly nuanced and insistent product preferences. "All the research we're doing tells us that the driver of demand going forward is all about products that are 'right for me,"' says David Martin, president of Interbrand Corp. "And that's ultimately about offering a degree of customization for all."  In the competition for ad dollars, the new digital media -- especially the Internet -- are blessed by two intrinsic advantages over mass media. First, they are interactive. This capability enables marketers to gather reams of invaluable personal information directly from customers and adjust their sales pitch accordingly, in some cases in real time. Second, in part because digital media are interactive they permit a fuller and more precise measuring of advertising's impact. "Advertisers want to exactly know what they are paying for and what they are getting for it, and you really get metrics on the Web," says David Verklin, CEO of Carat North America, a media-buying agency. "Clients really believe in the Web now."
