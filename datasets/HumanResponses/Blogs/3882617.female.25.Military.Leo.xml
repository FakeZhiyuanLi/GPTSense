        today, i made my hat. well, i am in the process of making my hat. now i am waiting for some glue to dry. it looks pretty cool so far. while making the hat i watched "the dish" and am now watching "lilo and stitch."        &nbsp;   the dish was good. very uplifting.       &nbsp;   lilo and stitch is awesome. its just a great great movie. a disney movie with an elvis and hawaiian soundtrack. who wouldn't like it?       &nbsp;   i used to think that my sister carrie was like&nbsp;lilo. just&nbsp;a girl who&nbsp;is misunderstood.&nbsp;but now i really&nbsp;think she is like stitch. with out the happy ending. she is just bad. it's not fun, but what can you do? my family has tried everything, but it hasn't helped, she just gets worse. she is 18 years old and still throws temper tantrums. she does horrible things like call our mother names and chase us around the house with a bat. sigh.        &nbsp;   "he will be irresitably drawn to large cities where he will back up sewers, reverse street signs, and steal everyone's left shoe." yep, that's carrie, but she's meaner.       &nbsp;   ah, i wish this glue would dry faster. it looks pretty good so far... i just wish it wasn't so hard to make!

       towards the end, when no one loves her -   the beaded curtain in the kitchen rustles.    could it be her true love?    no, it is her cat.     &nbsp;  that's me. i have my cats.     &nbsp;  when&nbsp;i am feeling especially sad and lonely, they are silly and purr loudly.     &nbsp;  except my true love is not at the door.    sometimes it seems like he will never be at the door.    i cry.

       It seems like there are more bloggers each time I look. That's really great. I don't know why, but writing here makes me feel better. It soothes me. Even when I am writing about nothing in particular. That's nice. And if you are looking at what I write, all the better!

       Here's a quick blog about my weekend...     Friday was great.&nbsp; I had planned to stay in and do some correspondence courses, but a friend (we'll call him A) dragged me out. We went ballroom dancing. It was a lot of fun. I got asked to dance a lot. And I suck, but at least I tried, right? So now I kinda know the basic steps to lots of dances like foxtrot and rhumba :) My favorites are still meringue and swing, but I added a new favorite to the list - the hustle! Basically the female partner gets swung around and around and she gets dizzy. All to the beat of the music, of course. Very very fun. The ballroom was called the Promenade and is on the outskirts of Baltimore   urlLink  http://www.mddancesport.com      So then there was Saturday. I was going to go to Great Falls as usual, but then I thought I should get some work done. Then, A dragged me out again (he is a bad influence) to go climbing at an indoor gym called Earth Treks   urlLink  http://www.earthtreksclimbing.com/   . It was great. I had been before with another person, but he does bewildering, which I am not strong enough in the arms to do. This time I climbed up! I'd like to go back, but need to get a harness and shoes, because they are expensive to rent each time. My birthday is coming up... ;)     After climbing for a while, A and I wanted to eat and then come back, but the other people we were with wanted to go to a concert. And I would have said no, but the band was They Might Be Giants. Cool, right? Or at least should have been. I don't know why, but I just was not impressed. It was not a good show unless you know all the words, which I don't (well, I only know the words to the really old songs). Oh well. The concert was outside, and the capitol building looked really cool in the background.   urlLink  http://www.liveonpenn.com/      After that, A and I wanted to go out - we were in DC! So much to do! But the people we were with were sticks in the mud. I thought they were interesting in other ways though, so we ended up going with them back to College Park. The only other option was going with this scary girl I had never met before. So we rode the metro back, and ended up at Applebee's. Let me just say that the Applebee's experience was so bad that I just filled out their feedback form online to tell them how bad it was. Not only was the food horrible, the waitress was very very rude.     Then, most people went home, but some of us went we went to some horrible restaurant trying to be a nightclub called "Lupo" in College Park. It was just blah, dirty college scene. No thanks. So we went to a coffee shop called College Perk   urlLink  http://www.collegeperk.org/    which was actually pretty cool. It is a little grungy, but you get the feeling that you are hanging out at your friend's grandparents house or something. They serve a large variety of real teas. They have board games (they are old, but at least they are there) and even a guitar for the guests to play with. In general, it was pretty cool. Unfortunately, I was so tired, I could not enjoy it, but that is ok.     So then there was Sunday. I woke up at 11 (yes, I am a bum) and puttered around the house for a bit. I went shopping at Joanne Fabrics for costume stuff and then had lunch with a friend at Macaroni Grill. It was a nice relaxing day.

        so, this is a little late, but here you go. my weekend:       &nbsp;   Saturday I went hiking at Great Falls, of course. It was sort of weird cause we had a new person, but whatever. It was a busy day, with lots of people illegally swimming (the Potomac river in that section has killed many people). So we had to tell them to get out and of course the dumb kids protest. Um, and quite a few people bringing dogs illegally on the trail too (it is a unique ecosystem and the doggies trample it).       &nbsp;   One of the coolest things tho was meeting Mozart. and he is a cockatoo. yes, boys and girls, a hiking cockatoo. He is apparently really smart and stays on his companion's shoulder as he hikes across America (actually he is too fat to fly- it's all the pine nuts). You can see some pics and more info here:    urlLink   http://www.cockatooweb.com/     &nbsp;The idea rocks, but I would never want one, they are waaay too much work.       &nbsp;   Ah, after that I had to drive around for a while doing stuff, but ended up at a new friend's house. There was this interesting party.... I could not have imagined a stranger yet cuter group of people. The ages range from 16 to&nbsp; 26. And there are all types of people. All of them are great. They remind me of friends from Tampa and other places that I have lost touch with. Aaaand, they cosplay :)&nbsp; I miss silly people. So, hopefully I will be able to make friends with them (like I am an envoy from the Enterprise going to a new planet- yes I am a dork). There was lots of alcohol, but hardly anyone was actually drinking, which was cool. We talked about crazy stuff all night. I even sang for a PS2 Karaoke game that is pretty neat. I did not want to leave.        &nbsp;   But I did leave, because I thought I was going to Delaware to the beach on Sunday at like 8am. I went to bed at about 4 and my husband kept me on the phone from like 5 to 6. So I got no sleep. But I was up and ready to go at 7! Went to the meeting place, and no one was there. And noone was answering the door. So I took a short nap in my car until I received a call from another new friend. We couldn't get them to wake up so went for b-fast in a local diner. Drove around, went to Starbucks and tried to think of what to do. We drove almost to Annapolis, but I called my dad to check the weather- thanks, dad :) and he said it would rain all day. We finally got a call from the girl who arranged the beach trip and she was hung over or something. So we went car shopping. He's looking for an Acura. little sporty thing. The day ended with getting lost in Georgetown in DC. All in all, it was an ok day, but I wish I could go to the beach!       &nbsp;   Now, I am in the middle of a new week. Whatever, right? One more week closer to the rest of my life. I hope it includes the silly group more frequently :)       &nbsp;     &nbsp;

        Ok, so I am a little slow, and don't often catch movies as they come out. But, DUDE! I love movies that make me laugh. It was so great.&nbsp;I was quite impressed. kids- yeah. It is pretty amazing. They really are like that, if you let them. I miss my kids at St. Pat's. I used to work at a daycare. And we had a ball. The older ones&nbsp;would talk about all kinds of crazy things. And the younger ones loved the edible bubbles.

      well, despite the slow start, i ended up having a pretty good night.&nbsp;  first of all, just for the reccord, i tried to hang out with a group of girls. but they had no planning and by the time thy finally got back to me, i was already out! this again&nbsp;proves why girls are often not good to hang out with.  so i went out with&nbsp;a new friend&nbsp;from the trail club (thank goodness for that club) and we went to a few different places in Bethesda, MD. it is a really nice neighborhood, clean and safe.  first to flanagans where they had cider on tap and folk singer. and a real live irishman for a waiter. his accent was soo cute.  then walking around, went to some ballroom where some people were dancing rhumba (let me just say wow! i have never seen rhumba before) but when we tried to dance a little, they told us to pay $13 each,&nbsp;and the place was closing in a few minutes! no way, jose. so we left.  then down to a big club/bar/outdoor restaruant. we chose a table outside near the door so we could hear the music. the food was excellent, i had a baby greens salad with steak kabobs and a vinegar/honey dressing. the wait staff was great too. it had a dumb name like "American Grill" though.  um, then we walked around a little more and decided to find a coffee shop, but most were closed so we went to a cute little diner across the street from white marsh (i kinda actually knew where i was all night!).  so, all in all, it was quite fun. i can't even tell you how nice it is to hang out with someone who has no ulterior motive. we just talked about all kinds of stuff, mostly music, dancing, and culture differences (he's from india- been here 3 yrs).  so, now it is LATE and i need to sleep, so i can hike tomorrow!  good night!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      i miss florida and korea. it never seemed so hard to find people to go out at night with there. am i abnormal for wanting to go dancing? am i abnormal for wanting to start before 10pm? arg.&nbsp;so i may end up going out... but that would require people getting back to me before the night ends. and everyone has to go to bed early... so can't even stay out late. sometimes i wish i was more gutsier so i could just go by myself. just pick a latin club, and go. or go to a bar? i don't know. i just want to have a night life more. i want to get dressed up and have some fun! sure, there is plenty of stuff to do on the weekend, but after the sun goes down... you can hear the crickets.

       Let me count the ways. Last night, my husband called me at like 2am (11pm for him). He said "I love you" and I asked why (you know, just because). He totally suprised me by saying "because you are not what I expected."  I hope that is a good thing :) I think so. He is not what I expected at all either, but I am so incredibly happy that he is the person I married. I think a lot of pepole have this template of who we think we will end up with. This imaginary person is who we measure everyone else up to. Well, for me, my husband is everything plus more. It sounds silly. I know. But he is smarter, sweeter, sillier, more handsome... than I had imagined. He has his flaws, of course, but nothing can be perfect - that would just be annoying! I hope I am the same for him. I look forward to living together. Right now, it is like being a Knight and his Lady. Because they had to endure being apart, and could not change things. Ah, I am a hopeless romantic! Can you love someone too much? Sometimes, well, all the time, I hurt because we are apart. I think about him a lot - just about everything reminds me of him. Sigh.  Hopefully in October I will fly to Texas to see him for a weekend. From now, we have about 6 months to go until Christmas. From there, it will breeze.

      So, while I was at home all day, I found the next superhero I want to cosplay: Power Girl! (Sorry that this post is a mile long. I can't help it.)  Real name: Karen Starr Occupation: Adventurer Base of Operations: New York City Marital Status: Single Height: 5' 7" Weight: 160 Eyes: Blue Hair: Blond  Pretty close, eh? Plus she is a hottie!!! I want to look like this ;)  urlLink     And I will, at DragonCon. Yeah baby! With swashbuckler boots and all.   I bought my ticket yesterday. I don't know if anyone from MD is going to drive down with me... but I am going. I have reserved a room, but if I can't fill it, I have other places to stay. Ah, there are other things I wanted to do for Labor Day weekend, but this will definately be fun. Last time I went as Bat Girl. And I had an amazing time. Cons are great!  urlLink     So, a friend of mine at the con will be playing Black Canary (which I really wanted to do but she got it first). And, conviently, Power Girl has worked with Black Canary. and just about everyone else, for that matter. And, she is Superman's cousin, but her costume is way better than Supergirl.  Some day, I would like to convince my husband to cosplay. One possibility: Hawk and Dove. The costumes are a little retro, but I really like them. I don't know if I can convince him to wear spandex tho :(  urlLink      urlLink

        Last night, when I got home from work, my kitchen sink was overflowing with dirty stinky water. It was making horrible gurgling noises and spouting water in the air.   A still moment.  urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink      I called the apartment's emergency line and eventually got a call back. While I was waiting, I bailed out the sink into my trash can. Removing the water releived the suction pressure or something, and it stopped making noises. The guy got there and said he would come back tomorrow.    So, this morning, I went to PT. After running the 2 mile, I told the next highest enlisted guy under me that I might be late cause I have to wait for the repairman. So I went home, showered, and waited. Then I took a nap (yes, that was nice) and waited some more. They finally came at 4pm (I get off work at 4:30). Darn. ;)

      why can't i sleep any more?  each night i try. really i do. even sometimes i'll have a glass of wine or two hoping that will help. but i lay down and toss and turn all night. it seems like i only fall asleep for less than ten minutes at a time before i am rolling over again. so here i am at work, struggling to keep my eyes open. it is a lot of work just to stay awake. i bet if i crawled under my small desk and put my head on the floor, i would be out like a light. i have no trouble falling asleep for a lunchtime nap or when i first get home from work at like 5pm.  i guess i am not doing enough during the day? but i dont see how thta is possible. iknow i do way more than most people do.

      I played a new game today called cluzzle. it is pretty good. like the part of cranium with the clay but not. my best sculpture this time was for the cule van gogh (head and shoulders of a man with one ear, the other ear on the side, and a picture with a sunflower on an easel next to him). i really enjoy sculpting silly stuff like that. i am no artist, but seem to be good at speed sculpting of a clue. www.cluzzle.com   .   i learned how to play because i was at the beltsville community center strategy games group. it meets every monday night. i like it the best when there are children, because then they beat me at go. today the kids were all on vacation or something so it was just me, a nice math teacher who plays magic, an older retired couple, dom who invented cluzzle, and john who started the club.  board games, dancing, hiking... these are all things that young people like, aren't they? it seems like i am having a hard time meeting people who are my age... eh, it makes me miss my husband and long ago friends from florida like michael and denise. we had some good times.  i miss being in korea when all you had to do to make plans for the night was walk into your neighbor's room! romalyn!

      eh, it was kinda boring. but we tried. i think i had unrealistic expectations of ny.  we finally made it to the city at about 8pm. the city does look cool to drive into. so we parked near  urlLink serendipity 3 , which is where my cousin wanted to go (it is the cafe where the people meet in that adulterous movie serendipity). they said they had a two hour wait!!! and lots of people were waiting. we went to eat dinner while we waited at a place called "china fun" which was pretty good and had no wait. we did finally get seated at serendipity and i have to admit "frozen hot chocolate" is pretty good. but it was not good enough for a two hour wait!     urlLink    at Serendipity 3 with my cousins&nbsp; urlLink     then we drive to "the village" which is supposed to be cool, but i was not too impressed. it was better when i was there a few years ago. we went to jekyll and hyde's and the slaughtered lamb. they are supposed to be famous and great, but i think they are getting run down. and one of the people i was with had a slug in his beer. we dont know what it really was, but it was gross.  so, that was probably my last excursion into ny.  it was really nice to see my cousin and meet new cousins though!

      sometimes on the www there is so much information and other times there is nothing!!! a seemingly simple question- is there are parking garage in/near northern new york city where i can leave my car and take the subway during the day? apparently there are none. at least on the internet. so now i am on the phone with some transit operator thing but i have a feeling i am going to be in the queue for a long long time. what a pain!!!  well, i wrote that at like noon. but, no one wants to move, and well, i don't want to be rude... so here i am sitting i the same apartment at 5pm. yay. i wish i had gone hiking this weekend like i usualy do.

      i am in NY state now, about an hour NW of the city. what an interesting night last night. first of all it took way way longer to get there than i thought it would. i drove thru newark, which was very weird. the highway system up here is absolutely nothing like anything we ahve in FL. when i was in korea it was just like the one here, but i thought it was unique to seoul. so now i know. oh, like the best part was seeing ads for broadway shows on the way.  so i finally met my uncle at his hotel, and we left to return to the reception. it took like 2 and 1/2 hours. thru little towns and mountain roads and crap. got there, and they were all leaving. so we followed the school bus the wedding party was in (don't ask) and went to their hotel. where everyone was very very drunkenly wandering off to their hotel rooms to sleep with someone they met at the wedding (i am so so so glad mine was not like that. we just had wine, no liquor, and let me tell you- that is the way to go). so in general, yuck. my cousin wanted to stay for a while and visit with family she hadn't seen for a long time (understandable) so i witnessed all sorts of craziness. drunken sluts are not fun to be around. but whatever.   so, as a side note- if that is what most weddings are like, mine was an outstanding sucess. it was soooo great for many reasons, and no one barfed dowm the hallway (how classy).  so since no one knew how to get back to our hotel, i had to convince the hotel clerk to mapquest me directions to my uncle's hotel. it took 45 min to get back. but, my cousin wanted to stay at her other cousin'd place where she had left her stuff. so i called my sister in tampa and asked her to mapquest that. so we set off from the hotel after dropping off uncle at his hotel. at this point, it is like 2 am. the drive was supposed to be less than 4 miles according to map quest. over an hour later, we finally arrive at the place. sigh. luckily this guy has a nice apartment (he is back at the hotel with the drunken slut from the wedding). so we talked for a while and went to sleep after 5am.   i got up a lot this morning, but managed to stay in my sleeping bag till 1140. now trying to convince cousin that we shoudl get moving, i want to see the big city. but i suppose it is the city that never sleeps, so we can wait and stay all night. i think i am going to drive in, because the last train leaves at 1am, and i dont want to get stranded there or have to leave before we want.   i really want to go to jekyll and hyde's but we will see. i need to call and see if we can get a reservation for a late dinner. and chinatown is definately on the list, and seeing if there are tickets avaliable for sunday afternoon.   i figure if i leave by 5pm sunday, i will be good to go. by the time it gets dark, i will be in familiar territory. and get there at like 10pm or so.   ok, gonna have breakfast (string cheese and an english muffin). if i have time i may write about another in a long line of weird ass dreams.

      ok, so i have like 25 minutes before i can go to the pool (i am still watching the phones). i had been trying to swim after work, but it usually rains right then. so, yesterday was the first day i went swimming during lunch, and it was great. my office was all hot and sweaty, and it was such a refreshing relief to take off all my heavy clothes and dive into the pool! i think i need that little me time during the day. it is in a nice spot, with trees around it so you can hear the birds singing. the kids sort of get in my way, but i try to be patient. i think that i am going to try to take an actual swimming lesson so i can do the various strokes correctly.   oh, speaking of lesson! last night someone from the trail club came over (i tried to have a bbq but only one person came- another story) and he was actually very intersting. conviently, he is a ballroom dancer, and will set me up with the dancing club at the local college. i really like club dancing like merengue, but hey, i'll learn to mambo- let's go! i always thought tango was terribly sexy too. just need some partners now!  speaking of dancing, made me think of the person who taught me how to dance salsa. i really miss this guy from korea named john. we had a great arrangement- he kinda liked me but was respectful enough to leave me alone in that respect. but he was like the papa bear of a large network of latinos in korea. so i was the papa's girl (or so people thought) so no one messed with me ever. hehe. and he was a big sweetie and great dancer to boot. he is a chaplan's assistant. i hope he is doing good out there somewhere.   i like guys who you can have a good friendship with. it sucks when you can't be friends with a great guy cause he can't get past the fact that you are a girl. i think that problem may have a lot to do with my current profession. cause the college people and others that i have been meeting are not so bad. i can't wait to leave this job!  ok! time to change and then to swim!

      hello there. this is my first post. my sister has had a livejournal account for forever, and i've looked at it, but i didn't think i had the time. but then, a few days ago, my husband got one here. and like he cant have anything i dont have or some silliness. so i guess i will try too. i tried at first on live journal, but the fact that half of it does not work unless you pay sucks. so here i am trying this one. today probably isn't the best day for me to start because i am feeling a little blah, but here i am.  i'm at work right now, have been for approximately 2 hours, but it feels like 5. not that the day has been so bad necessarily, but i am stuck in my office. i have to answer the phone because the secretary is not here. actually, almost noone is here. about 8 people out of 25 are here. some are on leave or off to various business trips. i wish i was not here too, but then i couldn't go home to my two wonderful kitties. i always miss them when i am away on business trips.  speaking of away, i am driving to new york after work. i almost want to just go to sleep instead. but it should be fun.  well, i am going to take some silly online class toward a microsoft office certification (never hurts to have more on your resume).

       ok, really quick before i have to leave for pt.   at about 1230, he calls me back and tries to have a conversation. it was really nice, except for he tried to fit it all into a less than 5 minute gap between his activities. and then calls me back at almost 1am... knowing i have to get up at 530. ahhh- it is so frustrating. do i want to talk to him at 1am, knowing that i will be miserable the next day? no. i have to be responsible and attempt to sleep. even though i know i won't get to talk to him again for a while (he is rarely in a talkative mood). but i can't sacrifice my work preformance.    he still never said what he was doing when he was dissapeared on saturday night. which is ok, but i wish he woun't cause me so much greif!   at least he wanted to talk to me, though? i am really glad that he called.   every time i start to get really upset about the situation, he acts like he cares. and i start to think, yes, he loves me, and i am overreacting. but then it happens all over again next week.   ah, i really do beleive that he loves me, but sometimes he forgets. or wants to forget... don't know which is worse. sometimes i wish i could forget, but that is not what marraige is about...   one thing i do know is that i start college on the 30th. at that point, i won't have time to care what he is doing, because my schedule will be so crazy. then we won't ever be able to talk for more than 5 minutes, which is i suppose what he wants.

       So I called him. At 1130pm here, which is 830pm here. If you have to be at work in the morning, where would you be at 830pm? Well, my loving hubby is off at dinner with his friends. And of course has no time to talk to me. Geez. I waited as long as I possibly could. So that hopfully he would be back at home getting ready for work? When I do call, I call at a time when most people would not be busy. But he is busy 24/7. At least too busy for me. Oh well. I tried.   So I have talked to my husband for a grand total of less than 15 minutes for the entire weekend from Friday evening to Sunday night.   What can a girl do? Try not not care? Try to be complacent about the whole thing? Sure, whatever.   I just wish I could sleep.

       - Working all day did me a lot of good, but there is still something on my mind that has been stuck there for a while. - My sister Valerie has had a live journal for a long time. She says that it is very therapudic, and I agree (at least for the short time that I have had a blog). She uses it to write her feelings, and sometimes her friends or boyfriend or strangers will read it and make comments and it helps to get the problem resolved. Or at least might make her feel better. So make comments and help poor old me. - Disclaimer for you single gentlemen- just cause my life is not perfect, it does not mean that I am avaliable. So, thanks, but no thanks. - So, um, here I go. I am married, have been for about 6 months. My husband and I have been separated for about 2 years because of our jobs. Yeah, I know it sucks. For most of the time it has been bearable. Difficult at times, but there is webcam, and phone, and we visited as often as possible. It looked like we would make it with little problem. - Then he came to visit for Memorial Day. And, it ended up being one of the worst weekends of my life. Basically everything seemed ok (nice, even!) until it was bedtime the first day. He went into the bedroom, changed into pjs and got into bed. And faced the wall. I was like, "ok, he's tired." I thought the pjs were weird (who doesn't see their spouse for months and then want to wear clothes to bed) but whatever. So I slipped into something more comfortable, and tried to snuggle up to his back. He totally rejects me. So eventaully he says that he feels uncomfortable, and that being with me doesn't feel right. So of course I cry. Who wouldn't? We sort of made up but it was odd for the whole weekend. For three days I was millimeters away from crying. I didn't know what to think or do or say. So then the last day, we ended up having this huge fight. I dont even know what started it, really (I think my dumb ass asked what wrong, but I couldn't let it go unresolved- yes, I am a typical female sometimes). But it was a really really bad one. - The resolution ended up being this 1) when he thinks about me (talks to me, etc) it makes him sad that we are separated so he doesnt want to talk to me. Also, he just doesn't like talking on the phone in general (which, I admit, I knew from the beginning). and 2) when we dont talk, it makes me sad. I'm lonely. Also, I get paranoid (my last boyfriend cheated a lot a lot when I had to go out of town for a few months, so I think I have some reason- not that I compare current to ex, but still). - So, yes, those are sort of incompatabile differences. But I am ok with talking less... but it does really make me sad that he doens't want to talk to me. What can you do. So, basically, I try really hard to refrain from calling him unless I really can't stand it any more (it's not too much, I swear). And mostly just wait for him to call me. - However, most phone conversations (increasingly so more and more to this date) have been getting worse. They are 99% of the time very short (less than 5 minutes). He rarely asks how my day went, and doesn't answer when I ask him. When we finally seem to be having a good conversation, he has to go. - When he does tell me how his day went, he never mentions his daily activities, etc. It is always the same thing, poker and beer. I am glad he is having fun. Really, truly, I am. But honestly! I mean, I am a playful modern girl. I like a beer just as much as the next guy. And I really enjoy board games and cards. But I sure as hell don't drink daily. The poker I'm not really worried about. He likes strategy, mind manuipulation, etc. So that's ok (as long as he is not loosing too much! and as long as he doesn't get addicted or whatever). But the alcohol... that's been an issue for a while. - (insert Wayne's World flashback noise) Before I went to Korea, I went to Fort Leonardwood for too many months for processing. What happens when you get a whole lot of military (especially Army) with nothing to do? They drink. So, one day, I get a little tipsy at a dance club. After the club, some people suggested making a bonfire. I think that sounds like fun. I had known these people for a little while and knew I would be safe and stuff. So we go, have a bonfire, and a little beer. And I happen to have a disposable camera. I am warm, so I take off my bra under my shirt (you know girls can do that with out showing anything at all). And someone takes a picture. And then a female friend was dared to show her tattoo (which is on her butt cheek a few inches below the top of her butt crack). So she says she won't show her tattoo unless I show a little butt too. So, yeah, I am a little peer pressured, and I show like 2 inches of butt. And someone takes a picture. And there are a few more pics of me being inebriated. Probably not very flattering. I know someone tried to kiss me, but of course he did not succeed. Not sure if there was a picture of that.  Yeah, it was dumb. And I definately would not have shown a partial moon if I hadn't been drinking. - I go to Korea, and forget all about this bonfire and I forget all about the camera. And I ask my loving brand new fiance to develop the photos for me when he comes to visit. Good idea, right? No! Geez. So he develops them and finds pictures of drunken Stacie in compromising pictures. Of course, he thought the worst and calls me. It is the middle of my work day. I was in the middle of health inspections, and... well, it was bad. The worst part was that I had forgotten all about it at that time. So it looked even worse, that I was so drunk that I forgot. I remembered the whole thing later, but not until after my fiance had pretty much decided to break up with me. A Korean friend said to me while I was crying, "after the rain, the rice grows green." Which made me feel much better. So then we talked and decided that we would get back together on the condition that I never touch a drop of alcohol. Because it causes you to make bad decisions. Yes, I probably should have told him about it in the first place. And I decided to do just that. Even if something totally innocent happens, because that way there are no suprises. Of course, now-a-days we have so little phone time for me to say what I am up to, but that's another issue. - Later on, it was Korean New Year, and I was given a beer to toast with. It would have been very very rude to0 refuse. So I toasted and drank a little. I told him about it later, and he got really really mad because I had touched alcohol. - Getting the picture? My husband has always said that alcohol is bad, that it makes people do things they don't mean to do, etc. So, I adjust my beleifs and values about alcohol to be that it is ok, but only very infrequently and in very small amounts. And he decided that he trusted me enough to drink but not drink too much. - So now, all of a sudden, it is ok for him to be playing games like 40-man or something where two 20 oz bottles of beer are duct tapped to his hands. He must drink them both quickly to get untaped. And I am very very glad that he tells me about it. I want to know about his life in general, and well, it's just good to know what is going on. But it still worries me! It would worry anyone in my situation! - So on Saturday morning, he calls to say he is sorry about not calling on Friday night. He says he was too drunk to call me because of 40-man. I do my best to laugh it off (trying as always not to think about the logical conclusion- if you were too drunk to call me, were you too drunk to say no?). Then, Saturday night, I am at this quasi-birthday-party. It was ok, but there were a few lovey couples there that made me miss hubby. So I try to call and text multiple times, with no answer. Nothing. I finally fall asleep (after laying there worried for like 3 hours) at 6am. Today, I went to Great Falls to voluenteer. He did call, but I was busy shoveling and stuff, so didn't hear the vibrate. He had called 4 times between 3:20 and 3:50pm. I called back when I saw that I had missed the call, and left a message saying what I was up to. Now it is after 11pm here and he hasn't called back. I will call him before I go to bed just to make sure he is ok. - I guess what all this adds up to is that I think he doens't care anymore. Oh, wait. I forgot a few things. - A few months ago, I asked him what he wanted to do for Labor Day (we can only see each other on holidays). He said he wanted to go to Las Vegas with his friends. This is because he has not gotten to spend a 4 day weekend with his friends. I try (to no avail) to explain that this is the only chance we have to see each other before Thanksgiving, and that he sees his friends every day. He does not care and has already made up his mind. So, I bought tickets to DragonCon in Atlanta. Yes, I want to go to DragonCon, but not as much as I want to see my husband! But obviously, Las Vegas and his friends are more important than me. You tell me how I am supposed to feel about that. - Then a little while ago he finds out that he can't go to college we planned to go to together, for various reasons. He decides that the best thing for his career is to move back home and finish school there. Ok, that's fine. Yeah, it sort of changes my plans, but you gotta do what you gotta do (there are advantages and disadvantages to both for me- it would definately be cheaper to go home, though!). The problem is that when he told me, he didn't ask if there was a possibility of my switching to back home as well. He didn't express any dissapointment that we might have to be separated again. It was like he didn't even care if we lived together or not. - Ah, I talked to my mom about it for a while today (it all just came out cause I told my little sister that I might be comming home to finish college). She says not to worry, and that we can get marraige counseling if needed after we try living together. But what't the point if he doesn't care anymore? Oh, that's enough. Time for the conclusion, so I can go to bed. - Ok, I will admit I think too much. I will admit that I sometimes make mountains out of molehills. So that is why I am writing this. To get it all out of my system. And maybe I will get some good comments. - The End

       urlLink      Today I went to Great Falls National Park along the Potomac River, on the Maryland Side. I have been volenteering at the Billy Goat Trail for a while now, but today was the first day that I actually helped to repair the trail. Basically, part of the trail was low, so formed a puddle when it rained. People would go around the puddle, packing the ground with their feet, and expanding the low area. So then there was a bigger and bigger puddle. And the forest kept getting trampled as people stepped around it. So a trail that should be no bigger than 3 to 5 feet wide ended up about 15 to 20 feet wide. Soooo PATC (Potomac Appalacian Trail Club, I think) decided to fix it. And I went to help. They had already done some of the work on Saturday. Today I ended up shoveling and picking and moving rocks and all sorts of things like that. Afterwards I hiked the trail. All in all, I was there from about 10 to 6:30. Now I am worn out. But it was a good day.

      Just popped in a movie from  urlLink Netflix . I have always adored Audrey Hepburn, but haven't watched many of her movies. Funny Face is great, and it just started. She is so beautiful. I wish I was beautiful and graceful like her. Eh, I haven't been feeling very pretty lately. Hopefully I will look good as PowerGirl, and then I will feel better at DragonCon. I will be the best PowerGirl! And then it is ok if I am not a good Audrey.

       I just got back from a business trip. It was ok. Not great, but ok. Too much wasted time. And no computer access!   Albequerue has some very interesting archetechture. It is like the 50sih style of architecture you can find in old Florida tourist towns, but southwestern and made of adobe. Very odd.    The last day of the trip was fun because I went around town a little with a great guy from my office who can really dance. We found this little bar called the   urlLink  Atomic Cantina   . They had this kickass rockabilly band... man, did that guy have a voice. And before that we ate at a Brazillian place called   urlLink  Tucanos   . I wish there was one in the DC/Bmore area! It was so good. I love grilled foods. I was bad this weekend- I'm not a very good vegetarian.    So that was the weekend.    For pics, see my homepage from my profile.      Incedentally, I am now officially old. I am 25 today. Was supposed to have a party, but no one showed. Happy Birthday to me. No, really, it isn't that bad. My friend A left balloons and flowers at my house (he was watching kitties while I was gone) which was really nice. I got cards from my mom and my husband's grandparents. And, my friend from work paid for dinner and stuff on Thursday, which was awesome. I am dissapointed that I am not going out though. Friday the 13th does not happen very often, and less often on my bday.  One nice thing was that my husband had his briends sing me Happy Birthday over the phone. He is getting me a subscription to Nature, which I have been wanting for a while.

       Ah, I am such a bum. I could have gone dancing to a place called H2O tonight, but I am tired. So here I am having a lazy night. I did go hiking earlier at Great Falls Billy Goat A after work, though. More later (if I am not being too lazy).

       Well, tomorow is no PT. So I dont have to get up until 8am.   I am going dancing in Baltimore. I hope it is a good place.   Going to the   urlLink  Latin Palace   . The website sounds good.    I just want a nice dirty (as in not pristine ballroomish) place to dance. Is that so much to ask? Can I go back to Moonlight with John and Romalyn? No. So I will try Latin Palace with A. It will probably be crappy, and we wont get there till after 9pm, but I shall try it.      Sigh. I feel so so far away from my husband. I wish he could be a part of my life and that I could be a part of his. It's so hard. Why does this have to happen to me?

      Blah. I feel like crapola. Maybe because I had CiCi's pizza for lunch. Arg. And my eyes hurt a lot. Oh, and my knees are not feeling good either. And I am really really tired. But I am going to go salsa dancing anyway. Oh, and my husband and I are incapable of having a conversation. He does not care how my life is going, and won't answer if I ask him how his is. Ah, well. What can you do? I am off to salsa.

      Ok, so at Otakon, there were these cute boys dressed as Yatta. They even did the dance.     So I had to go and find the song. It had been a long long time since I had seen it! I found a few different versions. The  urlLink original  (look at yatta.asf) (the jimmy kimmel show has subtitles) and some  urlLink really weird other stuff . Take a look. G-R-Double E-N-Leaves!  Warning: do not look at "good yatta explanation here." I think yatta is cute and good. And that is not! Yeech!

        Quick political thoughts from me in response to an email from my very right winged dad    (I am smack in the middle)...         Well, the other facts may be right or wrong, but one thing I know for sure is that military morale is just about the opposite of high. We all have too many friends or family members over there. We all have to live with the fact that we could be scooped up at any seccond for a war that has no end in sight. For a war that doesn't seem to make sense any more (why/what are we fighting?). And you can't protect your self from random car bombs. I wish the Muslims would take care of themselves.      This is something I have been thinking of for a long time. In the military we have a phrase "police up the area" meaning to pick up your own trash. You could also say "police your people" meaning to watch the behaviour of your own group. Well, the Iraquis and Isralis and whatever (Muslims and Middle Easterners in general, I suppose) need to police their people! If they don't want to be stereotyped, they should stop those people from blowing up cars and stuff. I know that all Muslims are not bad. I think my dad is a Muslim (or a Scientologist?) and I am tolerant of all peoples. I know that there are only a few really "bad guys." However, those bad guys need henchmen and stuff to do their evil deeds like blowing up cars. The good people over there need to stop their cousins or whatever from getting drawn to the bad guys. It's like keeping kids out of gangs.      Similarlily, we (as in UN, Muslim and US good guys) need to get better intel on where the boss bad guys are, and get them before they can convert more people to their evil ways. Yes, it sounds simplistic, but SNIPE THOSE BASTARDS!!!       Dad's email:   Learn these facts to properly debate our poor misguided liberal friends &amp; family before election time !!!      There were 39 combat related killings in Iraq during the month of January..... In the fair city of Detroit there were 35 murders in the month of January. That's just one American city, about as deadly as the entire war torn country of Iraq.            It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in Florida!!!! Our Commander-In-Chief is doing a GREAT JOB! Military moral is high! The Democrats and the biased media hope we are too ignorant to realize the facts.      I won't even say anything about the votes in FL. I think something fishy happened there, but I don't know enough details to say. On thing I do know is that a person with so many business connections should be the president. Or any other elected official. There is too much opportunity for wrong doing.       And as for the casualties... go to   urlLink  http://icasualties.org/oif/    It also lists the wounded. I have personally seen and met soldiers with amputations. Can you imagine loosing both of your hands at the age of 20? To drink a beer on your 21st, you have to use your shiny new claw. Can you imagine loving sports, loving to run... and then loosing a leg? To have to live the rest of your life (100-20=80) 80 years without a limb... Regardless of your politics, you can't look at that and say that this war is right. I'd like to see more politicians visit Walter Reed so they can see exactly what their descisions result in. See the pain on a young spouse's face when they see their loved one come home totally destroyed for life. See the children who don't get to play with their mom or dad. Well, at least the families of the injured get to have their loved ones come home.      I used to be a registered republican. Now I am registered as an independent. I don't want to vote this year. And I guarantee that most military and their families feel the same way. Because most of us  were  republicans. We're not too excited with Kerry... but what can you do?
