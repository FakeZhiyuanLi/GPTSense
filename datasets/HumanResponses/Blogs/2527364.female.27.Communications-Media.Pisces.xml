      The consequence of being discovered was far beyond my mind. My heart raced at every moment that I would spend with Z. An exhilarating kiss, a gentle touch... everything about him fired the flames of desire.   But like a typhoon, his passion hit strong, and it hit hard. Only days after our sessions of rapturous osculation, we went to visit the mountain to view the city in it's nightly spendor. I had forewarned myself not to let myself be swept away by our fervor, but Z was so patient with me. Even though I was extremely tired, exhausted, he never took advantage of me. He gave the reins of control without having me ask for it.   In the end, despite the fact that I wanted to savour his conquest, my seduction was complete. We shared many beautiful moments under the starry night, overlooking the great city, whether it be on a cold, open promontory, under a hidden tree or steamy car, in full view of the passersby. Little that I knew that as my acquisition was consumed, something seemingly innocent started to stalk me, disguised as admiration, appreciation, infatuation and lust. Little that I knew that this was the beginning of the end of who I was.   For the days that followed, it was escalation versus escalation, the pushing and taunting of our eachother's limits, and inevitably, the shock of discovery when we see that we had no limits together. A shocking and revealing proof of that occurred one evening, while watching a movie at home, casually over sushi. He was his usual, sweet, passionate self and we spent more time kissing than watching the movie. Then I brough him over to my bed.  Gingerly enticing him, our naked bodies torturing and teasing eachother, we fooled around without security, wondering who would succumb first to the urge to protect ourselves. He had never had sex without a condom and the 2 men I had intercourse without a condom were both virgins. Both of us were raised thinking it senseless not to use a condom in a relationship... and yet... together, we ignored those limits... and the consequences... But the overwhelming feeling of exhilaration... was just a taste of what was to come...   On Fridays, I always pick up my mother's medication from the pharmacy. After waiting a whole day to see Z, he met me at the pharmacy. As our lips interlocked, the whole world around us seemed to disappear. Unfortunately, that disappearance was but an illusion, and it was shattered with the arrival of Sam's mother, probably wondering what I was doing in the arms of a man other than her son. The moment was ackward, and the realization came swift: I had to tell Sam.   But what to tell him? That I had committed yet another sacrilege and worst even, with his best friend? In my mind, that friendship must be preserved, and I was going to stop at nothing to find a way to unbreak it.   So that night, I revealed the cushioned and edited version:   That Z and I had shared but a passionate kiss, and that there was no explanation other than the fact that we appreciated eachother's company so much that we didn't know how to express it.   It went fairly smoothly. It was determined that I could never see Z again. Z and I have come to terms with that too, and parted eachother (after an immensely clich√© 'one last time') with the idea that we could never see eachother again.  But the attraction was too great. And we continued to see eathother.

      On one fateful May night, Z and I touched. Just a simple, innocent touch. Then a hug. Then lying down together, holding eachother in our arms. When we got out of our underground hangout, we could not bear not touching eachother.   Now the question in my mind the whole week after that fateful day, is that "would if have been inevitable if we hadn't taken AP?" Looking back, I would like to believe so.  But the fact of the moment remained that we could not stop thinking about those moments. Throughout the week, we would e-mail eachother, almost not willing to admit that touching eachother was the most intense and desirable part of the experience (or at least that is how I felt). The feeling of wanting him grew throughout the whole week, but I didn't want to admit it. I wanted to seduce him, to conquer him, to experience his passion, his flame in hopes of rekindling mine, regardless of my morality, ignoring my conscience. After that week, we went back to that place to re-experience the bliss that it provided to us.   I was no longer satisfied with simply and innocently touching. I wanted to feel his lips press against mine. I wanted to hold him in my arms and never let go. I was addicted to him, searching, so longing for the flame that only he can provide. As our lips touched, maybe hearing but not even realizing that he was repeatedly saying "no kissing, no kissing", I won...  That moment was the point of no return for me. I had been a "good girl" for over a year and a half. In a desperate instant, I had throw away the mask that kept my passion in check, the flame that I denied myself in hopes to fit into the concept of society's  moralistic ideals. Knowing the consequences of my actions, knowing the hard and hurtful future yet not caring for the instant that would follow this moment. All of the sudden, I became free once again. I found the vibe that had once defined me as a person, that had set me apart from the rest, at the cost of my waning, feeble and almost non-existent integrity.   The aftermath of that kiss came flowing like a raging river. Day after day we would spend countless blissful and erotic moments that soared through heights that I formerly thought impossible to reach. But the price was yet to come for such thoughtless actions.

      What a mess. Sam was my boyfriend. Z was Sam's best friend and I was Z's closest friend!   Z and I would talk literally for hours on the phone, raising his cellphone bill to devastating heights. But when we would see eachother, an invisible barrier would form around us, protecting us from showing (and admitting) our growing feelings for eachother.    White Squall, Grey Drizzle  In the beginning of January 2004, I was suffering from extreme sadness. Being a person who doesn't like expressing sad or depressed moods, I would try my best not to exteriorize it. I couldn't put my finger on what was making my life so miserable, so I just blame it on health problems (I have Insulin Resistance syndrome, and apparently it screws around with my hormones as well, therefore making my moods are drastic as chronic PMS/menopause).   But the sadness and despair didn't go away. It got worst, no matter what I did. I tried to invite friends over more often, organize supper parties, spend some time with Sam, but nothing was working. I'm told I'm a person who always seems to have a smile, no matter rain or shine. I always felt like giddy school girl, bouncing on walls with the enthousiasm of a child. That fire, that passion, that aspect of me is what  *MAKES*  me. And that part was slowly rotting away.   Slowly, people were asking me why I am not so smiley anymore, my family would ask why I don't see them, my friends would call/write me to see why haven't I replied to them. Inside, I felt increasingly depressed, as if I was drowning, loosing myself. I spoke to Sam about my condition, hoping to get some console and maybe solace and comfort, he said nothing and just stared on the floor.   But I found solace in a veritable kindred soul. Z was going through a similar phase of unhapiness, although I do not believe I'll ever know until what point he was unhappy with his life. Together, we talked, we laughed, we enjoyed eachother's presence and comfort to a level that I never knew possible. We were such a complement to eachother, enjoying the same things, having the same interests, spurring the same drive for excitement, pushing eachother to our limits, wanting to find eachother's limits... We both had edge, we both loved exhilaration... We both deplored the mundane, the humdrum, the colourless aspect of idleness...   The more and more I got to know him, with each passing day, his presence was like a pristine river washing away footprints in the sand, he gave me an even greater appreciation for life and inspired me to be better than I am, more than I expected of myself. In his presence, I found myself, I rekindled the lost and depraved fire and passion that were boxed, battled and bruised inside me. I was so happy... I was so grateful...   We'd go out to raves, I'd invite him over to watch DVDs, we'd go to underground "hangouts"... We'd do anything and we would enjoy it together! I grew to value his friendship and he became an increasingly important and indispensible part of my life.   Then one fateful night, over our first experiences with a particular substance, I broke the invisible barrier and simply touched him. But that touch fueled a series of events that would change the course of our friendship forever.

      My boyfriend (let's call him Sam) of 11 years and I had just moved in together in January. We were high school sweethearts. We grew up together, literally!   Unfortunately, as we grew up, our lives and feelings for eachother started changing. As much as I wanted to believe he was the one and only man in my life, curiosity, loneliness, lust and greed led me astray for the last 7-8 years of our relationship. Each time I cheated on him, he fought valiantly to win me back. A part of me didn't want to come back with him, it was my only way of separating from him. When I would tell him that I cheated on him, a weight would be lifted from my shoulders, as if I was finally free. But I always knew he'd come back. Because he loved me. Because he needed me. Maybe I needed that feeling, to feel wanted, needed. But I've always felt that I was trapped, and there was no escape.   Sam is a great guy. In 11 years, he never once raised a hand to me, put me down, treated me bad in any way. He is intelligent, responsible, mature, honorable, righteous, kind, caring, nondiscriminatory... A great man! Any woman's dream! The "Good Girl" deeply cared for,  Loved , this man, and wanted to provide the support every great man needs. That part of me told me that I am fool for not loving him as much as he loves me and every fiber of my being believes that I am a thoroughly contemptible, detestable person to have done the things I did to him.   But the "Bad Girl" in me wanted so much more. I wanted passion, exhilaration, excitement, romance, tenderness, rapture, intensity... I wanted understanding, support, caring, sincerity. I felt that although he was a great man, he was so detached from his emotions, so not-in-touch with his inner-self, that it made me feel like a piece of furniture. His cold and analytical way of dealing with our relationship cut me deep and left me feeling inadequate and overly sentimental and emotional. His complete and utter lack of passion was also present in the bedroom. Although he was kind and caring, lovemaking lasted rarely over 15 minutes (foreplay included) and was as frequent as a lunar eclipse.   "Good" or "Bad", the  Woman  in me was always a voracious vixen with inumerable desires and an insatiable sexual energy.   But this year, it was going to be different. After finally being able to live together, we were going to make this relationship work. I was a good girl, trading in my life of fun, raves, going out with friends and adventure for a cozy life of cuddling in front of the TV, watching DVDs, inviting friends over for supper... A normal couples' life. We also work together. Actually, about literally 3 feet apart. I thought everything would work out, I didn't need other mens' affection, didn't need to hurt anyone else, I just needed to be home.  Sam and I had a very dear and close friend from college that, after finishing University, went to work abroad. We missed him dearly.  Everytime he would come back from Germany, he would contact us and we'd go out for a coffee, political discussions, the boys would talk tech talk and I would completely ignore those conversations...   But he disappeared for 2 years, no news, no hello, no goodbyes. Needless to say, at the end of summer 2003, when I received an e-mail from him, we were more than excited! Seeing as he felt horrible not having contacted us in such a long time, seeing how sincere and ashamed he felt, I immediately invited him out to come to a farm with Sam and I. I got to know him so much more, discovered that he was a looong way from the child-like enthousiastic Z I knew from college. At the same time, he discovered that I wasn't the good girl I pretended to be when I was in college. Two things hit me that night, camping under the cold starry night: 1. How alike we seem, both having put on masks to feel accepted within the morals of our society and 2. how I felt comfortable and at ease talking to him because of his great and unbigoted persona.   During the course of the next few months, a deep, sincere friendship developped between Z and I, deeper than what we had before. I would tell him things I have never told anyone before. In exchange, he would reveal his inner demons and secrets to me. It was the perfect exchange, and the perfect setting for what was to come.

       "Baka". The Japanese word for idiot. Baka is a word that aptly describes me.  Have you ever fallen in love? Do you remember that wonderful, fluttery feel of being with the person you love? That sense of completeness, sense of tenderness, of hope, of dreams, of happiness, of everything that's right in the world? Have you ever been so in love, that everything else seems so bleak, so mundane, until you are with that person, that magnificent being, and suddenly, with every passing day, the sky was bluer, the grass got greener, beauty was  *literally*  everywhere, hope prevailed, the universe transformed into pure joy and the appreciation for life could not be any greater?   There are absolutely no other words that I know to describe that feeling. All the other words that I have in my mind are totally and utterly inadequate. That word is simply and purely "Love".  I had love. After a lifetime of searching, I found it. And you know why I'm an idiot? Because I threw it away, in the worst possible way. This is my pathetic and sappy love story.
