      about the only thing that i haven't been doing lately is my DOF work, as over the weekend i hand scrubbed the floors, windexed the windows, swept, cleaned out the trash can, scrubbed the kitchen floors, cooked and had dinner @ 3f, and i even jogged twice!    but i can't tell you how hard its been for me to... or rather how hard it *was*... for me to write and send that damn updated budget to the Resist folks.  i mean it's for 1,500 bucks, no small chump change.  i wonder if its that i feel a little out of my league or that i have so much work i don't really know how to organize it all and do it, but one things for sure, jogging over the past week has definitely pumped up my adrenaline picked up my energy and i think its even working around my depression.  i wanna actually go jogging before i leave for work today, hopefully i'll have time to do that... other things i want to talk about in future posts, last nites "reunion" dinner @ 3f, pushing the limits of bonding/emotional connection with debanuj, and my mom and her struggle and finally contacting her sunday after getting busy signals and no answers at her hospital when i called over last week.  *blaqueer.hope

      so casey just left... all nite and all morning was so awkward.  it's like i don't like him anymore - that i don't want affection, desire,crushin', intimacy.  it's really scary to feel this way - so closed to other queer men.  and he was probably - or rather seemed to notice the awkwardness, but i wonder if he just internalized it and thought it was something he was doing.  at some points of us hanging out i was like in my head, "make the moves casey. excite our interactions. make a joke. call out the tension.  do something!"  the more that i experiment with dating, the more i come to feel that right now its not what i want, but then i don't really spend time working on myself or haven't been and i could be building my friendships better than i already do, so what the hell do i want then?

      ...so today i cancelled some accounts: manhunt.net, adam4adam.com,men4now.com, & gay.com. i also deleted all of my trickbuds from my aim and yahoo msg. screenname.  tho impulsive, i've been meaning to do this for a while.  i hope to start a new chapter in my life.   i woke up this morning thinking about brian gabriel - the young man who at the time  was my child molestor, but who was also the first person to fuck me and for me to want it.  a very complicated situation.  i woke up this morning remembering how good his dick felt inside me while also remembering how loud a screamed the day he started fucking me and no one was home - it was spring break and his family was in louisana - i screamed for him to stop, but he didn't.  as i lay in bed this morning i thought about how much those early sexual experience inform my sexuality today.  i wondered what if i had never hit on adrian gabriel that day... and how that would inform me adolescence and my current sexuality.  would i have come out in high school?  or would i have stay in the closet longer?  how would me and brian's sexual relationship had played out?    and then i came to think about my hook ups on the aforementioned website and how they related in some ways with brian and me's interaction. brian and i often didn't speak to each other... we really couldn't cause often we were fucking in the middle of the day with his whole family there in a tiny ass house in the bathroom... he often would - i remember - put his hands over my mouth while he inserted his cock - no lube - inside me... how complicated my sexuality is.  i rarely speak to and hold conversations with the guys i hook up with.    i also feel like my sexuality is informed by my experiences in austin.  oh the aching heart!  oh i crushed on a lot of boys there.  thats really the reason why i moved to austin, but it was "gayer" and i could move around the city easily as far as transport.  i thought that austin would open boyfriend doors that were not available to me in houston.  (right now i'm trying to recall the boys that i crushed on, mostly white in my first two years, but who didn't reciprocate/weren't interested...)  jason thibodeaux was one... max was another, he was from venezuela... other boys? hmm.. i can't recall now, but alas there was definitely a handful of them.  definitely brian gabriel and these so-called white knights have informed my current sexuality: with brian informing my hook up, no talking, bottom fantasy, secret-from-friends-family/different life sexuality and the white knights playing a role in my resistance and closed-ness to relationships and self-worth...  but today and tomorrow are all new dayz that i hope informs me still...
