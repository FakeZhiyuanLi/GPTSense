      Well seems as though my parents want to send me to some church camp shit. For like 2 weeks. Cause they don't have the time for the "shit" I put them through. And I don't see how I can do much considering I stay in my room and computer room the whole day. Just seems to me like they cant handle their own kidd. But that's just me. Yea plus my dad is quitting his job and we are most likely moving either this year or next. If my mom stays at her job than we are just moving in chandler. And if my mom doesn't stay at her job than we are moving out of state. To eeehh I think Minnesota, or Illinois. Times to go. Buh Byes. --Angie
