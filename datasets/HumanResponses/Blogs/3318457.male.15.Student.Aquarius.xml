      hIhI!! pEePs!! wat a relief, all major exams over liao left lit onli, quite minor hehehe, aniwae todaes history paper was as usual starved for time. even though i studied onli about 20 pages or so of the textbook and the fact that i couldn't complete the structured essay question, i believe that i might scrape. luckily, i happen to glance thru the chapter on one of the question we were suppose to choose. so far, all the exams tt have past are quite ok if u bother to study lar but if u dun study still can scrape lorZ.    budden some schools are so darn lucky they dun even have mid-yr but the pupils are complaining that the school system is warped. wat madness. imagine not having mid-yr. how mani brain cells could we save from death? and i cannot believe it lorZ, we go sch for 45 mins for one paper onli den hab to go another dae for the second part of the paper while the rest of the sec three slack at home. now this den ish called warped.  aniwae, i am and am notlooking fo'ard to the June holidays. glad that i can relax and pick up where i left off my training but unhappy simply becos i will be dead bored and most of all,  not being able to see moi frens esp some/a special ppl/person;-(  oKiEs pEePs, gOtTa gO sLeEp nOw, sO lOnG sWeEt dReAmS eVeRIoNe!!!nItEzzZZZZZzzzzzzzz:::
