      The friendship has just about to end instead of start once more.He thinks he's a smart guy but actually he sucks.My friend's other friend dun suck but extremly sucks.Haiz i dunno why in this world there is such persons..Theres a saying Nothing Is Fair In This World and i am dam mad:( WHY WHY WHY does this happens.The volcano is about to erupt and i don't care.Get this straight why does he have to play untill like this....Facing the same old day is sure boring.......

      Today I had a bad experience with my friend.He think he's so good at joking and don't think of people's feeling's.I was so hurt.He juz took my things and i was feeling mad but i couldn't be angry.Haiz if he continues like this i may have to breakup our friendship.Its so harsh of me actually but since i know him since i was quite young i have no idea what to do.I think i will give him a chance and hope he will change for the better.THats All for Today.6/7/2004
