						   I'm torn between starting this with a basic gesture that is most often grossly overlooked, or something a little more detailed. So here's a little of both:   Tip of the Day   Basic: Open the door for your lady. There is no reason a woman should have to open her own door when a perfectly able-bodied gentleman is standing idlely behind her. Step forward, reach out, open the door, and invite her to enter before you do. In addition to saving her a little extra work, it allows her to make a more stunning entrance...instead of forcing her to deal with the door as she clumsily enters the room.  More Detailed: Greet her in a mature and polite manner. "Hey.", "Wuz up?",  and "You're hot!" are not appropriate greetings. Use something akin to "Good evening" or "You look beautiful". Make her feel less like an object and show her that you appreciate the time she has put into looking good for you (and everyone else at wherever you're going). Combinations and different versions of such polite greetings are nearly endless and can add a few extra points. Examples would be similar to: "You look beautiful this evening" or "That is a lovely outfit you're wearing". But make sure you greet and then compliment. If you don't greet first, things can seem a little off or moving too fast.

						     Tip of the Day   Return her phone calls. When a girl calls you, it means one of two things: she wants something from you or she cares about you. If she calls "just to chat", that means she cares about you. If she calls asking for a favor, obviously she wants something from you. Either way, its probably not a bad thing. By doing the favor, you can impress her by showing her you are reliable. If you just take a few minutes (or hours, depending on the girl) to chat with her, she'll appreciate the gesture and your willingness to listen. Just make sure you return her phone call in a TIMELY MANNER. Don't wait a few days. Even if you don't have much time, you can at least call her back to let her know that. Otherwise, she'll think you're rude and hate you.

						     Tip of the Day   Drive safely. Normally, like most guys, are you less than law-obiding when operating a motor vehicle. However, when driving your date somewhere, you should make her feel safe and secure with your driving ability. Take it down a notch or two and don't....I REPEAT: DON'T...ever say, "Hey babe, watch this!"

						     Tip of the Day   Don't interrupt. When the lady is speaking, don't try to interject or override whatever she is saying. A conversation should be an exchange of ideas and/or emotions. Therefore, when you interrupt her, it is showing her that you believe your ideas and emotions are more important. Impress her by showing that you value what she thinks and feels about.

						     Tip of the Day   Let her keep her secrets. If she has things she doesn't want to share with you, that's fine. Don't be upset about it and don't get annoyingly nosy. There's nothing wrong with you wanting to know about her and her life, but if you know she has a diary, don't look for it. Finding it can end a relationship.

						     Tip of the Day   Let her sleep. When your lady is tired and needs her rest, let her sleep. You may have had plans or wanted to do something else, but if the woman you love is tired - let her sleep. You can always do things at another time/day. Even if they get cancelled all together, what's the big deal? Isn't her comfort (and happiness) more important? She'll be less grouchy, more rested, more energetic, and more delighted to be with you. A well rested woman is a very happy date.

						     Tip of the Day   Brush your teeth and use mouthwash. We've already covered the bathing part of your hygiene, so now we will cover the cleanliness of your mouth. When you lean in for the kiss, chances are, the girl will pull away if your breath smells like her toilet. If you just ate some nice Mexican food, or woke up and ate a bowl full of crap, please take a few moments out of your life and brush your teeth. Preferably after your done, use an antibacterial mouthwash and rinse your mouth out. That should guarantee (to 99.7% according to Listerine) the cleanliness of your mouth. :-) This will also guarantee that the woman you are leaning in to kiss won't turn and run...at least not from your breath!

						     Tip of the Day   Don't swear in the presence of a woman. Most women don't appreciate the foul-mouthed linguistical skills of your average man. Some men are pansies and don't swear, but for the most part, all guys have a sailor-spirit in them. When you're around women, keep the profanity in your head and the compliments flowing from your mouth. Of course, the obvious exception to this is if the female company you keep doesn't mind a little bad word here and there...especially if it excites them! (wink wink). ;-)

						     Tip of the Day   Take an interest. Learn about the woman you are either trying to impress (a.k.a. - get to know) or the woman you love. Find out what her birthstone is. What are her goals in life? Hell, even the classic favorite color is a good thing to know. You should care enough about her to learn about her. (It also helps when buying gifts!)

						     Tip of the Day   Surprise her. Bring her flowers or meet her when you know she doesn't really have much to do and might be bored. The womenfolk love surprises because...well, for a few reasons. First, it shows that you are thinking just a little outside the box. You care enough about her to take time out of your life (at least you've convinced her by now that you have one), and are willing to spend it with her. But they also like surprises because that means more time with you. You should want to spend a little extra time with your girl because she probably wants to spend it with you. But remember, don't try and surprise her in the middle of her work day when she has about 1,000 things to do and her boss is breathing down her neck. She'll think its "cute but stupid". Do it when you know she's not particularly busy or maybe a little sad or upset. A nice comforting hug can be the best thing in the world.

						     Tip of the Day   Bathe. Take a bath. Take a shower. Do something to erase the smell of sweaty sports, manual labor, or just sitting in the chair in front of your desk. The ladies don't want to smell  all  of you...just the nice parts. They'll smell the rest of you...umm...later. hahaha But seriously, make sure you are clean and presentable when seeing your lady.

						     Tip of the Day   Pay for the meal. Show her that you care by saving her the trouble of paying for herself or both of you. In modern society, some consider the first date to be an acceptable time to "go Dutch" - each person paying for their portion. But if you're looking to impress, pull out your cash or the always impressive Platinum card and pay for her. If it seems like she is trying to order the cheapest item on the menu or orders a salad and water, politely let her know that she should order whatever she wants...let her know there are no limitations. Even if it breaks your bank and the date is already outside your budget, if you care, you'll pay for whatever she wants. NOW - if she jumps from water to champagne, dump the gold-digging bitch!

						     Tip of the Day   Respect her parents. They may hate you, they may hate your relationship, they may be racist, they may be stupid, they may be arrogant, they may be pretentious, they may be snobs... But they are still her parents and, especially if you marry her, they will be a part of your life. And perhaps more importantly, they are what made the woman you love. They helped shaped who she is --through good or bad-- she is who she is due in large part to her parents.  Now, I'm not saying you need to revere them or buy them gifts, but you should at least be civil to them and not make the situation worse for her or your relationship. Put up with them whenever you have to. It will GREATLY help in the long run.

						     Tip of the Day   Compliment her on her progress/goals. This is especially good if your girl is trying to lose weight. Women like to know that you are noticing their progress. Hell, even if you haven't noticed a damn thing cuz you're too thick-skulled, comment on it anyway. This is actually pretty basic to understand. If they see that you are noticing their progress, they believe you're focusing attention on them and actually taking an interest in their life! You should be doing this anyway, but most of us guys don't notice things like that. Women, on the other hand, are so jealous, bitter, and backstabbing that they always notice the slightest ounce and go for the jugular with each other. I know - they're weird.

						     Tip of the Day   Don't be insensitive. Sometimes I have to catch myself on this one because men and women view many things in life with emotional differences. Girls can cry about the weirdest, most unimportant things. Guys can often not be emotional when its appropriate. Make sure that when your girl is upset, or happy, or worried, or scared that you aren't being an insensitive jackass and making stupid comments about it.

      The past two days have been the kind of days I write this Blog for. I'm not feeling great about much of anything, but I can go back through this Blog and realize that my life could be a lot harder, and that I have a lot to work with and look forward to. With every thing from friends, to Brothers, my love Patti, and my family, I'm a lot better off than other people. Especially the little things like clean water to drink, the sounds of Metallica, and the taste of chocolate are all worth appreciating.  And this weekend will have a lot of that. I'll be hanging out with friends, Brothers, Patti, and my family. I've still got clean water to drink, the sounds of Metallica, and I know I'll be having chocolate milk at least once with my girlfriend! (cuz she rocks!) There's definitely stuff to be happy about!

      Today Nathan and I took a fun little trip to the North side of town to get prices on different things.  After laying on several matresses and finding that we are too poor to buy the ones we (I) like we ventured on to Target, Linens 'n Things, Pier1 and Lowes.  We found many things we liked and wrote our ideas down so we would not forget.  Luckily while we were at Lowes we decided to check out the tile section one more time before leaving... this led us to find the bathroom tile that we really liked that is super inexpensive.  So jumping on this rare chance, not willing to test our luck and their future stock, we bought enough tile to do our third bathroom (Cryntel - Corsica Blue).  Although now that we have all the tile we are not sure which bathroom to do in blue and which to do in black and white.  Lucky for me this will be Nathan's decision!  So yippee for us, we are one more step closer to having our building materials all bought. Woo hoo.

      Patti and I just returned from Lowe's where we purchased our new bathroom tiles. So far, its only for the master (upstairs) and guest bathroom (downstairs). For the master bathroom, we chose the  Congoleum - Triumph Natural Stone . The bathroom will be very "earthy" with natural colors and patterns. For the downstairs bathroom, we're going for a two-tone look (this one is mine!) and it will be black and white. The flooring is  Armstrong - Granville White .  As soon as my parents move out, we'll be painting the bathrooms and laying down the new floor. But this is our first house purchase!

      To me it seems like the next 50 days are going to go by so slowly!!!  I can't wait to move into the house with Nathan!  The wait is torture!  Looks like this weekend is going to be a big plannig weekend for Nathan and I! Woo hoo!

      Next weekend will be another step in making the house a little more "ours". Patti and I will be picking up the new tiles for the bathroom floors and also replacing the curtains on the door to the backyard. The guy who fixed the upstairs carpet (and put in the new carpet border downstairs) tore the curtains! We may be changing the tiles for the downstairs bathroom to something stronger and nicer, but we'll decide that when we get there.

      Welcome to those of you that dare to venture into the insane world of myself and Nathan.  By now you are aware that we are starting a life together in just a few short weeks and we want you to be a part of it.  Well aren't you special! ;-)  If we didn't love you we wouldn't have told you! Ok well maybe we just want to gloat a little. ROFL.  But anyway, welcome to our site about our new lives.  Hope you enjoy reading about it!

      Our names are Nathan and Patti. We just bought our first house together and we're really excited about it. Between the two of us, we have at least 15 blogs, but none of our blogs that we share are viewable for the public. So we decided to create this as a journal for our friends (that would be you) to check whenever you are absolutely, completely, undeniably bored. After all, we're sure you're lives are more interesting than this blog, but nevertheless, we subject ourselves to your scrutiny, adoration, criticism, envy, and pity...and it can continue 24 hours a day because the Internet never dies.  Sorry, back on topic. This blog will be about our adventures in home ownership and our lives as an unmarried couple living together. I already told you that we are excited so I won't mention it again. (haha)

      With her training beginning tomorrow, Patti has moved in with a lot of her stuff tonight. It took less than 45 minutes to get it all in the house and about 15 - 20 minutes to organize and lay out. Before she arrived, I cleaned most of the bathroom (didn't have time for every square inch), my bedroom, and did a lot of vacuuming and dusting. I also cleaned off my entire windowseat. "Ever since I was a little girl, I've always wanted a windowseat that I could work on." So now she has one.  I did everything I could to create as much space for her as possible so she wouldn't feel cramped for the three weeks until my parents move out. Its not a Marriot, but I can still see some of the floor and have access to all my stuff. Worked out pretty well in my opinion. She's already hooked up to the DSL router and her stuff is all over the bathroom. With all four of us under one roof, this is going to be an interesting three weeks!

      Well with New Teacher Training this Thursday I have tons of things to wrap up here in Downey before I move to Moreno Valley.  I have so many things to pack, just clothing is a ton.  Then there will be the frequent weekend trips to pick up forgotten things.  Ugh.  On a positive note I will be signing the loan papers this Wednesday for the house, so things seem to be moving along nicely. I'm super excited but super stressed... Oh well, what's new! ROFL

      Now that Patti has a job teaching 5th grade at Jackson Elementary in Riverside, schedules have to change a little. She will be moving in to the house in the last week of June and will (unfortunately for her) be here for my parents' moving out. She'll get to witness the chaos and stress first hand. It also means that my room just got more cramped! Yesterday, we went out and purchased a 4' tall plastic chest of drawers so she can keep clothes here for work. She and I will probably be going back to her parents' house every weekend in preparation of moving out here permanently.  I have to get ready to share my space with someone else and not really having the space to do it. I have a bathroom and bedroom meant for one. But it will definitely be fun and exciting! I think stuff like this just brings us closer together. (Ain't that sappy?) I'm looking forward to it. As I see it, I get a preview of living with Patti BEFORE escrow closes.. *evil grin* ;)

      My parents have bought a home in Amherst, NY. Its more than 300 sq. ft. larger than our current house and is BRAND NEW. That's the biggest surprise to me. It isn't even done being built yet. Construction is scheduled to finish sometime in August, but my parents are still leaving in July and will stay in a hotel until its done. The concern they have about that is what to do with Vickie. I have a feeling she will be staying here, but my hope is that Sue (my Dad's co-worker and Vickie's former owner) will take her in.  The house is 2 stories plus a basement, with the top floor being a decent sized loft. The basement that is the full size of the house. There are two bedrooms with the loft acting as a third. There is also a kitchen with a dinette and a separate dining room, living room, two walk-in closets, and a two car garage. It comes with a real porch in the front of the house and their new association will pay for all gardening and water. There's also a country club nearby that my Mom has already had lunch in.  So progress continues in this tumultuous process. This means Patti and I are one step closer to living together. :) Oh yeah - my parents will have to buy a new stove, but Patti and I get to keep the microwave. Probably for a garage sale.

      As I wrote an e-mail to a friend, I realized that not everyone I know will understand the name of this blog (Welcome Home (Sanitarium)). So here's a brief explanation...  Patti and I were looking for a name for the blog and wanted something that would reflect who we are but also be somthing "home related". After chatting about random phrases, expressions, and word play, I suggested something musical. Namely, something from the realm of Metallica! I sifted through titles and lyrics, but there was one obvious choice: Welcome Home (Sanitarium). For those of you playing along at home, you can find this musical masterpiece on track four of their third album release "Master of Puppets" ( Lyrics ). Patti and I are both certifiably nuts, but we're both Metallica-loving homeowners so the song works!

      Two tin cans and a string would be easier to deal with than the crap I've had to put up with lately.  4 states 3 time zones 5 cities 15 people 2 weeks  The premise of a new reality show? Nope! A cool trip Patti and I are planning? Nope!  This is what it took for us to order DSL! Best of all, the order still hasn't been placed! That will happen tomorrow morning and once I get the necessary software and hardware, this process will be finished. In my effort to make the lives of my friends (that's you) a little easier and my goal of leaving a mark in history, I make the following recommendation:   AVOID  VERIZON   AT ALL COSTS!   Their customer service is atrocious, their capabilities are nothing more than a Neanderthal at Comdex, and their internal computer system is less reliable than two tin cans and a string.  ...in other news...  Patti and I had our first barbequed meal tonight. It was her famous aluminum foil chicken dinner and I had it for the first time. I will definitely request that again. Its really good! Food aside, I'm 2/3 done with installing the new tracks on the kitchen drawers and Patti has been busy putting shelf liner in and we're cleaning a whole bunch of pots, pans, dishes, and glasses everynight. She broke her crockpot tonight and had never even used it before. We also bought two new cordless phones last night from Target and they work pretty well. I like 'em and that's teh important thing because she didn't seem to care. Shopping was fun for that!

      Its been too long since the last update to this blog. As you might imagine, Patti and I have been extremely busy with work and, of course, making our new home reflect what we'd like it to look like: ours.  One of the most recent things we've done is a trip to Lowe's to get some paint and get started on changing the internal colors of the house. Patti got the idea to paint the walls behind the&nbsp;laundry and the refrigerator a bright white in an attempt to lighten the areas. It has worked considerably for the area behind the fridge and the washer/dryer area is still to come. She also had some designs for her closet. After doing a considerable amount of cleaning of the walls and shelves, she and I ripped out the carpet on the floor of the closet and replaced it with a nice piece of pine. Then the whole closet got painted white (same as the fridge area) and it looks awesome. We've decided that the whole bedroom will now be white because it looks so good.  For me, the projects have been somewhat less successful. My first mission was a new dog door for Blacky to fit through. A sawzall would have come in VERY handy for this project. But instead, I went ghetto and had to chisel through wood with a hammer and screwdriver. After hours of back-altering work, its about 75% done but easily usable and Blacky has adjusted very well. He hasn't moved yet, but at least we know that when he does, we won't have to worry about him using the door. My next project installing a new lighting fixture in the entryway to the master bedroom. I attempted that at 8:30pm and called it quits around 9:30 when things just didn't seem to be fitting right. I may end up taking it back to Lowe's and getting a smaller one more appropriate for the location.  So in summation, Patti's projects are going great and making things look better while mine seem to serve no other purpose than stripping my masculinity and leaving me with failure. (Was that over dramatized?!) But throughout all of these projects, we've been dealing with the details like utility companies, washing the dishes that have come out of storage, working and going to school, and ordering lots of take-out. I'm also still the Yard Commander and in charge of insect patrol, lawn maintenance, tree trimming, etc.  Its been a lot of hard work so far but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I think we're having a great time with the projects and living together has been wonderful so far. We will be moving all of the furniture this weekend and my friend Andrew has been kind enough to offer his assistance. Hopefully, once that final phase of major moving is completed, we'll be able to put the house together the way we want it.  After all is said and done, and we finally have settled in, we will be sending out invitations to our housewarming party. We're really looking forward to having all of you come and visit the new home and drink with us. I've already started preparing the alcohol supply for a diverse and prolonged necessity of thirsts. :)

      Escrow will officially close tomorrow and my parents will become squatters! I told them we would charge them rent if that made them feel more comfortable and respectable. ;)  Patti and I will pack up her room at her parents house on this upcoming weekend and then have all of her stuff (bedroom and storage) moved in by the end of the month. It will take a few trips, even with the Jeep, truck, and rented trailer, but it will finally be done. Hopefully, the housewarming party will happen by the end of August. We've already come up with a cool contest idea for the party (not sharing it with you yet) and our wish list for the house is enormous.  Patti and I have been putting a lot of time and effort into the landscaping of the house and preparing it for some of our ideas. She's done an incredible job working over a lot of the land and cleaning things up. We estimate that we can start our cactus garden in 2 - 3 weeks and we are looking at ways of removing the tons of lava rock all over the property. I've been on bug detail for a couple of months and go around smelling like pesticide. Everytime someone spots an ant anywhere outside, I'm called in with the sprayer to be John Goodman. Its fun and chemically educational!  Other than that fun stuff, my parents things get packed up on Wednesday and shipped out on Thursday. They'll be staying in a hotel until the 21st and then they board a plane for Buffalo. On the 16th, they'll be returning to the house to help do a lot of the cleaning (since all the furniture will be gone). Oddly, the house will be nearly devoid of furniture for over a week since we're not moving Patti's stuff until the weekend of the 23rd. I called most of the utilities today and taken the necessary steps to have the accounts put into my name. But it looks like we'll save a nice chunk of change if we switch to SBC for phone service and get their DSL service. I'll tackle that tomorrow.

      Patti and I did a huge amount of shopping for both groceries and home improvements. We started at Target with a list of four things we wanted to buy there. Big surprise - they didn't carry a single item. That sucked, but since a couple of the items were for Blacky, we just went next door to PetSmart and got them there. One of the things Patti bought was a new ID tag for Blacky with his new address. :)  After that, we headed to Lowe's and just went crazy. We're finally getting around to working on the master bathroom and wanted to buy all new stuff for it. That includes lighting fixtures, accessories, and paint. Not only did we get that stuff, we also bought a ton of other stuff for some other household projects and after purchasing the items, realized how poor we really are. LOL. :) Damn houses are expensive!  After that, we did a bunch of shopping for groceries at CostCo. I pointed out to Patti that we had reached our monthly grocery budget and could no longer buy food for the rest of August. We'll just have to starve. Damn food is expensive!  The good thing is that we are keeping good records of our purchases and staying within our budget (as best we can). Since this is the first month of budgeting and record keeping, I think its going along nicely. I've created some useful Excel spreadsheets to aid in the process. I strongly recommend doing that for anyone keeping a budget.  NEwayz, the house is coming along nicely and we look forward to getting it "done".
