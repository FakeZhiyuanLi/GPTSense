      I'm interested in International Trade Specialist.  So I am studying to be that now.   Thesedays, I have lost my first determination reached when I got a job for the first time.  I wanted to be a specialist in a part of my major such as technical business man, negotiator.  But, for a year and half, I can't figure out what I have learned and got about my job.  For now, I should be confused of what I have to do for future.  But, I will do my best. I trust myself.  Let bygones be bygones.  Today, I make a new determination again the same as usual.

      NEW YORK - Low interest rates, a booming housing market, and recurring waves of home refinancing have meant years of rising profits for banks like Washington Mutual. But when Alan Greenspan appeared before Congress last April, the market took him to mean that the Federal Reserve Board will be raising short-term interest rates later this year.    Even if the market is reading the Fed chairman correctly, it's worth noting that banks have ways to make money even when mortgage rates climb.   Carl Peterson, who manages money for Parkway Advisors, a firm based in Abilene, Tex. that manages institutional and retail accounts, likes banks that have diversified into investment banking. Banks able to play corporate America for securities business will be better positioned to weather a decline in the mortgage market, reasons Peterson, who culls his bank stocks from the S&P 500.   Prominent on Peterson's list of bank holdings are Bank of America (nyse: BAC - news - people ), Citigroup (nyse: C - news - people ) and J.P. Morgan Chase (nyse: JPM - news - people ). Peterson thinks that higher interest rates will also help big credit card issuers, like Citi and J.P. Morgan. Meanwhile, Bank of America's foray into free checking, which the firm uses as a lever to win fee-oriented business from new customers, should work well in an era of higher rates, Peterson says.   Bank of America trades at ten times estimated 2005 earnings; as does Citigroup and J.P. Morgan.   It's not just the titanic banks that will thrive as rates rise. Some smaller and regional banks are poised to excel if, and when, rates rise, say analysts at boutique broker Ryan Beck. Their list of likely winners: banks that generate a proportionately large amount of revenue from fees, banks with heavy commercial and industrial loan business, and those with large non-interest bearing deposits.   Ryan Beck analysts are fond of First Tennessee National, a unit of First Horizon (nyse: FHN - news - people ), and Synovus Financial (nyse: SNV - news - people ), which get 66% and 64%, respectively, of their revenue from fees (compared to an industry median of 20%). First Horizon trades for 11 times estimated 2005 profits; the 2005 multiple for Synovus is 15.   While the median bank has 12% of its lending portfolio tied up in commercial loans, Silicon Valley Bancshares (nasdaq: SIVB - news - people ) leads the industry with a 71% share. This could be a competitive advantage in an economic upturn, but not in a downturn. The bank with the greatest percentage of non-interest bearing deposits is UnionBanCal (nyse: UB - news - people ) at 48%, compared with a 14% median for the industry.   Ryan Beck is also recommending Independence Community Bank (nasdaq: ICBC - news - people ) and Zions Bancorporation (nasdaq: ZION - news - people ). Based in Salt Lake City, Zions enjoys a favorable location in the West, as well its standing as the top lender in agriculture. It trades at 11 times projected 2005 profits. Brooklyn-based Independence should benefit from a recent acquisition of Staten Island Bancorp, which gives it a secure funding source and opportunities to improve operations at its new unit. It trades for 11 times consensus 2005 profits.   With interest rates heading upward, these banks are poised to do well.

      One study says the number of hours spent in cars is a key determinant of being overweight; another notes that junk foods such as sodas and chips make up nearly one-third of calories consumed in the U.S. diet. A third study, by the U.K. Parliament, says that in Britain obesity "has grown by almost 400% in the last 25 years, and on present trends will soon surpass smoking as the greatest cause of premature loss of life.
