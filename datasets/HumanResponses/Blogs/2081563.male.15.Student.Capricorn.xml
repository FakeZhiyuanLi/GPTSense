      I went to work today and now my feet hurt a lot I feel old. Work was good I was on top of things. It was one of those strange nights where I've completed all  my tasks but there were still people and that angered me. Another thing that angered me is that "work Amy" quit, she didn't give 2 weeks notice, that's bad. That lady taught me how to mop and she won't even say good bye before she goes to work at Benny's or Denny's. What a slut.

      DON'T READ  urlLink THIS ARTICLE  everyone knows about Hilary Duff's Squeaky clean image, it's a waste of someone with a degree in journalism, it's a waste of time, energy, space on the Internet, it's a waste of everything!

      I am very dissapointed with the BBc, because there are no funny stories. Yesterday there was the one about the bozze and  weed in school lunches, Two days ago there was the one about pirate killings on the rise and the kid who wanted to divorce his dad. I am very very dissapointed with the BBC.

       urlLink    Its a polar bear eating ice cubeas and watermelon! Caaaaaaaaaaaraaaaaaaaaazy! If you click the link to see other pictures you'll be disapointed except for the last one because it looks like the Beastyie Boys' "Intergalactic" video.

      I just urinated and washed by hands but I have an not so interesting story. I pressed the flushing mechanism but I pressed it weirdly and it made a sound like it was going to suck up everything in the bathroom, so I pressed the lever again and it went back to normal.

      I was watching  urlLink Joe Schmo 2  and I noticed Joe Schmo has strange hair, it's not strange in an avant-garde way but it looks like it's made of wax. It's like when you get botox and you can't move your face for a while, he has permaheadtox!

      I've been home all day, as you can tell by reading all the other posts. I'm tired (and hungry), tired from doing nothing or tired of doing nothing.   I think I had one of those sex and the city moments where Carrie is writing and she writes something unbelievably witty and the camera zooms in on her writing it and she is at the end of the line, then she says something like "On the other side of town Samantha was at the beach with her man, she built an sand castle around him just so she could blow him without anyone noticing" like it's nothing at all, oh Carrie Bradshaw.

       urlLink    I was on  urlLink Reuters Pictures  and I saw this picture in the Kerry/Edwards section and I thought this looked like an  urlLink  iPod  commercial without any color. I'd like it if the two Johns did an iPod commercial together.

      I dislike Yahoo very much! They Take over everything. One example is musicvideos.com, it became launch.com, then it became launch.yahoo.com and now its a better site, but I just don't like that is owned by Yahoo. What really frustrates me is launch UK! I liked it when it was dotmusic, it was so easy to navigate, I really liked how each staff member had their own page, I liked all the .Asp scripts (the nerd comes out). The reviews were the best part, the quality of the reviews hasn't diminished but it's the style of their site. At one point you could see reviews from a while ago, now it's just archived for a few weeks. The hands down best part was the judging it was shown like 7/9 now its colored stars and un colored ones, which usually doesn't bother me but when it get a low score or is kinda in the middle its a bit confusing.

      I was watching  urlLink Arthur &nbsp;and I noticed something! All the kid characters are fat. They have poor eating habits, all they do is eat sugar ALL DAY LONG! They hang out at the fucking Sugar Bowl,&nbsp; in addition, the show is funded by Chuck E. Cheese, Teddy grahams and by Libby's Juicy Juice! In CONCLUSION Marc Brown is the reason why Americans are fat, because he invented a fantasy land where its ok to be fat.
