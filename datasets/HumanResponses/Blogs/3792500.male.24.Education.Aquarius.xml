      I had the luck to make three Red Sox games over four days last week, including two Yankee games on the weekend. I saw the massive brawl and it was awesome. Baseball can be so damn boring sometimes. I read that the ball is in play for about 15 minutes during the course of the entire game, so distractions (music, videos, bench-clearing brawls) are welcome in my book.    One thing I can't stand, however, is the "not fair" whining of the people involved in this brawl. Alex Rodriguez says he's a "victim". He's a victim of his own doing. He should have taken the beanball like a man and just taken his base. On the other side, the Red Sox are  aghast  that A-Rod would say he's the victim. Jason Varitek was simply tryin to protect his pitcher. The fact is, Varitek hit A-Rod in the face first, and he should be punished for it. Players and coaches should be allowed to argue as long as it doesn't disrupt the game too much, but he who throws the first punch needs to be dealt with. Sorry, 'Tek.    Instead of bitching and moaning about unfair suspensions, why don't you bitch and moan about a season that is increasingly close to going down the toilet.

      That's about it.  How hard is it for the Onion to update on Wednesday morning rather than afternoon?  Summer is incredibly slow at BU.  I can't imagine what it's like at the smaller schools around.    I bought a car this weekend and it won't be delivered until early next week.  Maybe I'm just anxious about that.  Just for kicks I checked to see when the next three-day weekend would be.  I shouldn't have because it turns out Labor Day is eight weeks away.  My co-worker Terrence said his sister-in-law's sister who works for the Pentagon says that the government is working on reinstating the draft.  Guess I have to get married, have kids, and go back to school before the presidential election.

      ... you can't get people safely to home plate.  Dale Sveum is allowed to make a mistake here and there -- we're all human -- and he should not be solely to blame about yesterday's Red Sox one-run loss to the White Sox.  Blame the hitters for not making contact and blame the management for bringing in such star  defensive  players such as Orlando Cabrera and Doug Mientkiewicz.  With one of the worst one-run game records in the majors, we traded away a clutch hitter for two players that are going to protect non-existent leads for us.  Brilliant.

      I'm not going to name names, situations, or places.  This is just a comment.  In the realm of dating and relationships, there are is a certain, unspoken etiquette that both sexes follow. It's not like there is a handbook or classes for this sort of thing, it's just learned throughout the trials and tribulations of life and love.  Little boys passing notes and throwing things at girls may work in elementary school, but it obviously wouldn't fly in post-college life.  What can be said about trying to show some interest can also be said about rebuffing or rejecting interest as well. Some people should realize that they're adults and take a second to look at the big picture, grow up, be respectful, and above all be honest and upfront.  Some may agree that honesty is the best policy, but the truth could hurt when it comes to love. Is the truth really what really hurts, or is it maybe the absence of respect the results in covering up honest feelings and thoughts?

      #1 You don't trade your franchise player, the player who gives 110% when he's on the field, the player who won't stop talking about one thing: winning a championship for his team and town.  #2 If you absolutely, postively have to trade that player, you don't trade him for a shitty shortstop with an on-base percentage below 300 in order to "upgrade" the defense. You also don't trade him for a fourth firstbaseman with a .246 batting average, just because he won a Gold Glove three years ago.  So what if Nomar bristled with the management? Everybody hates their boss(es) to some extent. Who can blame him after the awful handling of A-Rod/Manny/Nomar/Ordonez trade rumors during the winter? Money issues? The man gives his all whenever he is on the field. His grit and his desire to win should be included with his on-field and at-bat play when considering a contract. Manny Ramirez has been known to dog it. Pedro can't seem to shut up about how much he feels he deserves to be monetarialy treated right by the Red Sox, however, they're both still here.  You know who else is still here? Derek Lowe, Alan Embree, Kevin Millar's mouth and the marble sculpture known as Gabe Kapler. Thank God Derek Lowe has kept his mouth shut... or else he might have gone somewhere else. We can really use his numbers. I'd list them a few bad ones to point out his failings, but they're all bad. Where's the rejuvinated Ramiro Mendoza in the starting rotation? Where's BK Kim version 4.0?  The Sox were in a tough position, but they did little to alleviate the pressure. For the players in their contract years: Lowe is a joke and unsignable. Pedro's arm will fall off sooner or later. Varitek will want more years than the team is willing to give him. My bet is that they're going to do everything to keep Pedro and Varitek (probably with incentive-laced contracts to ensure his health). Though only 33 in October, Pedro is on pace to pitch about as many innings has he did in 2000. What happened in 2001? After five straight years of 200+ innings, a couple trips to the DL and only 18 appearances for the whole year. Pedro's first three years in Boston were absolutely magical, however he is a different player today and he needs to be treated and paid as such.  The Red Sox season is on a crash course to disappointment and mediocrity, and this may just be the beginning of a multi-year stretch.  Nomar loved this town and its fans and he was huge figure with local charities.  He may have been at odds with the management, but money is a great motivator and tool.  It only took about 15 years to go from Yaz to Nomar, so I can't wait until 2019.  As for now, I'll be on Yawkey Way, looking in the bargain bin for some Nomar memorabilia.
