         Regular naps prevent old age... especially if you take them while driving.  ==================================================  Having one child makes you a parent; having two you are a referee.  ==================================================  Marriage is a relationship in which one person is always right and the other is husband !  ==================================================  I believe we should all pay our tax with a smile. I tried - but they wanted cash.  ==================================================  A child's greatest period of growth is the month after you've purchased newn school uniforms.  ==================================================  Don't feel bad. A lot of people have no talent.  ==================================================  Don't marry the person you want to live with, marry the one you cannot live without... but whatever you do, you'll regret it later.  ==================================================  You can't buy love . . . but you pay heavily for it.  ==================================================  True friends stab you in the front.  ==================================================  Forgiveness is giving up my right to hate you for hurting me.  ==================================================  Bad officials are elected by good citizens who do not vote.  ==================================================  Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired.  =================================================  My wife and I always compromise. I admit I'm wrong and she agrees with me.  =================================================  Those who can't laugh at themselves leave the job to others.  =================================================  Ladies first. Pretty ladies sooner.  =================================================  It doesn't matter how often a married man changes his job, he still ends up with the same boss.  =================================================  Real friends are the ones who survive transitions   between address books.  =================================================  Saving is the best thing. Especially when your parents have done it for you.  =================================================  Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools talk because they have to say something.  =================================================  They call our language the mother tongue because the father seldom gets to speak.  =================================================

       A turtle was walking down an alley in New York when he was mugged by a gang of snails. A police detective came to investigate and asked the turtle if he could explain what happened. The turtle looked at the detective with a confused look on his face and replied "I don't know, it all happened so fast."   A doctor says to his patient, "I have bad news and worse news". "Oh dear, what's the bad news?" asks the patient. The doctor replies: "You only have 24 hours to live." "That's terrible," said the patient. "How can the news possibly be worse?". The doctor replies: "I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."   A woman gets on a bus with her baby. The bus driver says: "That's the ugliest baby that I've ever seen. Ugh!" The woman goes to the rear of the bus and sits down, fuming. She says to a man next to her: "The driver just insulted me!" The man says: "You go right up there and tell him off - go ahead, I'll hold your monkey for you."   When Nasa first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat the problem, scientists spent a decade and 12 billion dollars to develop a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to 300 C. The Russians used a pencil.   Jugnu Singh got up in the middle of the night to answer the telephone. "Is this one one one one?", says the voice. "No, this is eleven eleven." "Are you sure it isn't one one one one?" "No, this is eleven eleven." "Well, wrong number. I am Harpal calling, sorry to have woken you up on the middle of the night." "That's all right, mister. I had to get up to answer the telephone anyway."     Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps: "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator says: "Calm down, I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says: "OK, now what?? Jugnu Singh with two red ears went to his doctor. The doctor asked him what had happened to his ears and he answered, "I was ironing a shirt and the phone rang but instead of picking up the phone I accidentally picked up the iron and stuck it to my ear." "Oh Dear!" the doctor exclaimed in disbelief. "But...what happened to your other ear?" "That IDIOT called back."
