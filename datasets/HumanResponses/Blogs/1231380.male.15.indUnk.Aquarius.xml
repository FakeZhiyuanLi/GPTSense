Anyway, today is my sisters birthday,  Happy  21st B-Day Kelsi!  I'll talk to everyone again on Tuesday.  Fitz:Out!

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Video Game Fans Dance Off Extra Pounds  Being a big DDR fan myself, I know it really works. Screw the Atkins diet, DDR and eating healthy work great! I've lost about 10 pounds over the past 2 or 3 months. I play DDR about 30-45 minutes a day on Heavy, or about an hour when not on workout mode. It's all while having fun at the same time, not to mention how addicting it is!

       urlLink California senate approves anti-Gmail bill - News - ZDNet  Stupid Stupid Stupid!!! I have been trying to get a gmail account for a long time. Why? Because this is the future of the internet. 1GB of storage- people should be praising Google for this, not complaining there is no privacy. Sure, gmail places a  few  relevant ads discretely on the right side, but how do you think they can give a gig of storage free? These ads are nothing new, you see them everytime you perform a  urlLink google search . These crazy lawmakers have no idea what already exists on the internet that is a thousand times worse than a googlebot looking for key words in an email. Being a webmaster myself, I can tell you that if I wanted too, I could look at who has browsed my website, what OS and browser they are using, and even their exact location. But I don't do that, you know why, there are actual human beings that don't deserve to be treated like that.  Google is the king of searches, and a model perfect company,  and nobody should expect to change that, lawmakers included.

                     Wow. Hasn't technology grown these days? I can now  email myself to a special address and it automatically updates my blog. This is  like what I did with my moblog, until I stopped paying for internet access.  Hopefully I will keep it updated! Fitz:Out

      Actually, I can wait. I'm not really looking forward HLA, Spanish III doesn't really interest me. Oh well, I'll get the credit. I have a pretty boring life now that it's theater 'offseason'. I spend more time on the computer than I should, but I still go outside or borrow the neighbors pool and go swimming. So yeah, not much to say. I mowed the lawn. I ate. I went swimming. I'm here now. I'll be in my bed in a few hours. There aren't very many controversial topics in my head right now. I don't need to vent, I'm just kind of here. Bye.

      Hey everyone! I'm back from our family trip to San Antonio and it was a blast. We got there later in the day on Friday, rested a little bit, then went down to the river walk. We walked down one side, crossed over, then ate at an Italian place. It was my sisters b-day and the brought her Cheesecake and our waiter sang to her. We toured around some more then walked back to our room in the Taj Mahal. OK, we stayed in the Hampton Inn- small room, 2 very small beds, and no closet- It was fun trying to get ready with 3 other people. My dad and I went to Sea World at 6 in the morning. I rode Steel Eel about 10 times and Great White about 5. We went back downtown and picked the girls up, drove back to Sea World. We spent the rest of the day walking around and watching shows. We took the girls back to the hotel and my dad and I went to Fiesta Texas for some Exclusive Ride Time on Poltergeist and Scream! We had a great ride op named Gina that had a lot of fun with us and was very popular. Back to hotel. My sister had gone out with some friends that live in San Antonio and ended staying the night there. Mi Padre and I went back to SFFT at around 6am the next day (Sunday) and rode Superman:Krypton Coaster first thing for ERT. We then went on the cliff-top tour. This was a unique experience and very privledged. We watched SKC up on the cliff then went to where they fire off the fireworks for the Lone Star Spectacular. David Blazer (our escort and tour guide for the weekend) told us how most employees are not allowed on the cliff and neither is security- we were very privledged to go up there.  More on David- he is the director of entertainment and is the responsible for getting the park the 5 Golden Tickets for Best Entertainment. He was very knowledgeable and gave us great hospitality. He escorted us around both days and gave us a lot of great information. Back to the trip report- After the tour we went to Armadillo Beach (the waterpark) for ERT on the newest ride- TORNADO. It is a huge ride and is very intense for a waterpark ride. The group broke up and my dad and I spent some time in the park. We ate lunch at a group reservation place and had a great lunch on silverware and tablecloths. The General Manager and director of ride operations ate lunch with my dad and I had so much fun. They told us a lot about their jobs and what to expect in the coming months from the park. They also told my dad and I some stuff I'm not allowed to tell anyone else- yes, there is A LOT of room where Joker's Revene used to be. I'll leave it at that. We then spent more time in the park. It was very hot, so we watched some shows. We watched the Lone Star Spectacular and stayed in the ampitheater while security cleared the park. We proceeded to Rattler and got one ride in, then it broke down, so everyone headed to Road Runner Express. I love this ride. It is a little short but is quite intense for it's size. I must have ridden it at least 15 or 20 times in a row. I also want to mention that Gina, our ride op from the night before, said she had so much fun with us from the night before she came back again. She guest spieled on RoadRunner and took a few rides next to me. It was a great night. We headed back for the hotel and went sleepy. On monday we packed up and went home. boring day.  This was a great trip!
