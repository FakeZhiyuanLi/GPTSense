         Well, I certainly didn't think I'd make it this long without posting anything. 23 days. That's even longer than I thought it would be. Well I suppose I better write something interesting for all my fan(s). Some might guess by the frequency of my updates that this past month was pretty busy. In fact, the opposite could hardly be more true. I haven't been working nearly as many hours as May and June, and hopefully August.  That's not to say I haven't accomplished anything. I'm pretty much set for school this coming semester (so much for my track record of registering for classes after they had already started). I greatly expanded my music collection. I've actually been playing a good bit of guitar (my fingers now have callouses under the callouses). I started a new webcomic,  urlLink Real Life Comics , which currently has 1245 comics in the archives. That took a while to work through. Not to mention it has the slowest server ever! It's no  urlLink Megatokyo , but it's not too bad. I still have to put  urlLink Kagerou  at the top of my list of favorites though.  I'll admit to being a casual star trek fan and I've been borrowing the movies from a friend along with some really bad and pretty good old school sci-fi movies (Forbidden Planet, Plan 9 From Outer Space, The Day the Earth Stood Still). Wow. The first ST movie is just bad. I mean it. It would have been a good kind of bad if it weren't 2 and a freaking half hours long. You can only stand watching Kirk stare at the screen as the enterprise slowly advances from increasingly dramatic angles for so long! II-IV were oscar worthy by comparison. Although my opinion may not be particularly valid since I've only seen maybe two episodes of the original series. I've also been watching a lot of  urlLink Angel  recently since I just bought season 1 on dvd but unfortunately my dvd player stopped reading discs yesterday so I either wait till I build my computer, buy a new dvd player, or watch it on my brother's computer. Woe is me.  Hey, I guess this sorry piece of drivel counts as a real post. My blogging career has officially begun!. See you in another 3 weeks.

        Rather than saying hello and welcome to my little corner of the ISH/WWW I'll just say this is an experiment and I'll most likely get bored of this and updates will all but disappear when the fall semester begins and eventually quit within a year.   Otherwise I hope this is interesting enough (once I get some real content up, perhaps I should have come up with some before posting) to warrant return visits.
