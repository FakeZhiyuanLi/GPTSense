      Yesterday was incredible.   I really don't need to say any more. So I woke up and did some stuff and I did decide to wear shorts. And then when we were all in the car on the thruway the E-Z Pass didn't work. So the guy in the tollbooth said, "Back up Mr. Sutton." Refering to my grandfather. The thing was, no of us knew who the guy was. Someone got the idea that since he has the E-Z Pass that his name would show up on a computer, but the E-Z Pass wasn't working. So that was a little weird. Then we get on the bus and my grandfater had to sit with a stranger, but it turned out he wasn't a stranger at all. My grandfather sits down and this guy says, very loudly, "Mr. Sutton!" I turned to Julianna and said, "Another guy that knows him?" It turns out that the guy my grandfather sat with worked at Blue Circle, when it was Blue Circle and when my grandfather worked there. The bus ride was long, 3 hours, and we watched a movie, A League of Their Own. It was OK, but no Charlie Brown flick. Then we got in the city and we got our picture taken, and then we started out walk to Yankee Stadium. My mom and sister wanted to stop at the stores on the side with the entrance to the Bleachers. So we did and I got a number 33 Javier Vazquez shirt. Then we kept on walking, and the people who wanted to go to the stores didn't get anything, lol. We kept on walking and I had to take a pill for my toothache, so we had to get me some water. Oh, we found some, $4.25. Then we got inside the Stadium and we found our seats but Julianna wanted to get some food. So I went with her, and that walk with her was the best part of the day. I didn't even need to watch the game now. So she got her food and when we came back everyone was gone, we sat in the wrong seats, lol. So we relocated to our new seats, but I left my All-Star ballot at my first seat, :( I will vote online 17 times to make up for it ;). The game, eh, the rookie pitcher didn't fair too well, neiter did any other pitcher we borught in. The offense struggled, scoring 3 runs. One courtsey of a Matsui homerun. But the game, finally, did end. But throught out the whole game we had people yelling things around up. A father asking his son, Conner or sometimes Con, if he had the Jeter placque, a drunken Mets fans telling us to look at the scoreboard, a miserable daugter, or a guy telling the people above him to stop throwing the peanuts down at him and his son. But the best line didn't come at the Stadium but in the car after we eat dinner. But that will come a bit later. So, after the game we find our bus and they put in another movie, The Legend of Bagger Vance. I didn't watch the movie this time. Julianna and I played the Dots game where you have to make squares from connecting dots with lines. She won, but we played one game of Tic-Tac-Toe, and I won there :). Then we drew some things, the best was Julianna's drawing of the people saying things around us at the Stadium. But we were both tired and we slept. We went to dinner and then on the ride home my grandmother said something like, "What's that nosie." And I said to Julianna, "That's the sound of birds making babies." And my mom was acting a little strange so Julianna said, "I don't think those were cigarets she was smoking." And Julianna but her index and thumb together near her lips. Then we took Julianna home and it was like a field day back in Elememtary School. Everyone had to meet everyone else. And my grandmother and mom had to see Julianna's dogs. I was thinking to myself, Hey, I can see Julianna for a couple minutes more.' So I stepped out and not only did I get to see her some more, I got a hug out of it too. :) I got back home and told my mom that I only had the water from the begginning of the day to take a pill. So I drank some orange juice. Then I went to bed and feel alseep like a bear in winter. I slept for 13 hours, to make up for the 3 and a half I slept the other night. But now I am going to stop typing because you know you have been typing too much, or you are delusional when you type the word more and it looks wrong. And then you spellcheck it. And plus, I get to watch another Yankee game at 105, the pitching matchup we were supposed to see yesterday.  Yesterday was great Julianna, I wouldn't have wanted to spend it with anyone else. Goodbye all.

      LOL, long time since I last posted. Yeah-4 hours. HAHA. So it is 645 and it is downpouring outside my bedroom window. But I checked the weather for the Bronx and I checked the Doppler radar, it all looks good. But now I have a crisis. I don't know whether to wear pants or shorts. It will reach about 80 degrees today, but do I really want to wear shorts and show off my legs? Ummm NO. And the bus ride will be cold, but I will be hot sitting down. And I may get a tan with shorts, but maybe I will not because of where we are sitting. If only I knew if I was in right or left field, then this would all be solved.  Anyway today should be great, it could only be better in the Yankees put a beating on the Mets. But not too much now, I want to see Mo Rivera. I have seen him in every single Yankee Game I have ever attended, except for one. 1998 verses the Devil Rays, a game that started at 705 and ended around 11. Oh boy was it a blow out...for the other team. We lost by like 10 runs. But to you remember that film The Rookie? Well that guy, the pitcher, was at the game. I don't know if he pitched, all I know is that he was in the ballpark.  Well I better hurry off now to solve my crisis. They should invent an article of clothing that turns from AE Jeans to AE Shorts. Ahh goodbye!

      Well if finally came back to bite me in the ass. Because I have been staying up late, or early, everynight possible my body became used to going to bed at 230. And well, that isn't too good now. It is 140, I went to bed at 12 and I simply can not sleep. I tried watching TV, I got a drink, I had nothing on my mind at times, I had great thoughs other times. I even had the foolish idea to get my dog and try to fall asleep with him by me. And in my house everyone sleeps in a different room, even the dog. We are just a group of anti-socials. So I went into the extra bedroom, where my dog sleeps, and I called out his name a few times. But not to my suprise he didn't show himself. So I got down on the ground and reached under the bed, I know he is under the bed because I heard him scratching on my wall, and on my first attempt I lay my hand on a big ball of hair. It must have been his back or something, but it wouldn't have mattered if I touched his tail, head, back, or butt. He then let out this nasty sneeze/growl at me. And right then I knew I woke him up and he was pissed. But I wasn't too worried, he has all tomorrow to sleep. So then I went back into my room and got back in bed. I wasn't in bed for 10 seconds before I got the idea to come on the computer and report to this Blog Spot. This Blog Spot which is read by no one :). Eh, I don't care, I am writing this for something to do and for myself, while letting other people read if they choose.  LOL, up there instead of anti-socials I had anti-socialists. I meant people who were anti-social but I wanted to make it sound better. Good thing I caught that, anti-socialists are much different from anti-socials. For one, one of them may get shot showing their anti-whatever shirt around mid-Europe. And this year this whole thing went around how I was communist. It all happened when I bought this video game. Now in this game it had music that played, and I liked most of the songs that played. And there were only 20 or so, so I downloaded the ones that I liked. And one of the songs was Handful of Redemption by Boy Sets Fire. Months later I am in Coconuts looking to blow some money on a CD, what I do weekly. And I was looking at the artists names and I saw one name that stuck in my memory, Boy Sets Fire. So feeling happy and all that I remembered a name of a band that I heard of months ago; I bought the CD named Tomorrow Come Today. When I got home I turned on the CD on my computer to listen to the whole CD. Some of the songs were good, but others were horrific. So I saved the ones I liked on my computer and I looked at the Enhanced CD part of this Boy Sets Fire CD. All they had were live songs, so I listened. But inbetween two songs the singer said something like, "Next month on the White House lawn we are staging a protest against Bush." And they went on and on about Bush and his handling of Terrorism. And this got me thinking, this isn't your normal Fathers 70's protest band, these guys were more ratical. After watching the Enhanced CD I went online and searched for Boy Sets Fire. I found an interview done with them and I thought, "Great, now I will know what is up with this band." The results were unexpected. They were communists. One of them ordered the Communist Manifesto (A book about the Communist way) when he was a young teenager, 14 or so. Later that week I went to school with the CD and showed everyone what a fool I was, and how blind I was. Man was that a mistake. It was always a joke, always, but it stuck. Jimmy the Commie. It rhymed, a little bit. I even caught on calling myself a communist. And people went on and on and on. But finally it died down and the communist thing is only in the memories of the people who found it worth noting. They may have been communists but their music was great. Not too long ago I found out in Windows Media Player that I could see how many times I have played a song. So, curiously, I wanted to see what song I had played the most times. The results were unexpected. With 48 plays, Handful of Redemption by who else? Boy Sets Fire. This was a little suprise becasue when the whole 'Jimmy the Commie' thing started I stopped listening to the band. But, now, I figure it wasn't so weird. I have over 600 songs and to play one 48 times would be quite a job. But then again I got this one song 3 days ago and I have played it a whopping 40 times. But that may be because I have gotten a little tired of the 600 some songs I have.   Ha, look at the last few sentences. All I do is say one thing and contradict it with my next sentence. I guess I do that becasue in arguments I can't go wrong. Think about it, if I say, "Bush did a bad job with Terrorism" and then I say, "But who would have done a great job, no one could have predicted what would happen." I am covering both sides of the argument. It is weak because I am not focusing all my attention on one side of the argument but you can almost never go wrong. I have even done that in an argument with my dad and he noticed it and commended me on it.  Wow, it's 215. I have been writing this for 35 mintues. And, lol, I am missing the show I usually watch at 2 to write to my loyal fans. That show is Spin City, with Michael J. Fox. This was before Mike coudln't continue the show and Charlie Sheen took over. I really like some of the older shows. I will always watch a rerun of Seinfeld. Infomercials are cool too. You set it and forget it! And my new favorite one, You can't clean the air if you don't move the air. That is classic. Said by a man who looked healthy, but he gave you the sence that he could fall down any moment. I have babbled on long enough. And I feel a little tired!!! Ahhhh I have to get up in 6 hours and 20 minutes. And if you actually are reading this you know that I said that I wouldn't be counting down. What can I say? It's the Yankees. Have faith in the great DiMaggio my son. It was something I said. Ahhh I will go on and on if I don't stop myself right here. Okay, I am done, finally. Goodnight/morning depending where you are in the world. I should probably stop tring to be funny because I haven't made anyone laugh in months. Oh well, sometimes you lose it if you don't use it.

      Well the Baseball game got canceled and will be played on Sunday, not tomorrow! That means that the game I will be going to will not be pushed back to a later time, great news. Even greater news is that becasue of the rainout the pitcher who was supposed to pitch today will pitch tomorrow, and that is great.  So tonight is bound to be slow, my parents aren't home. Too bad there isn't a girl around, lol. But I did make myself some excitment. I saw some people walking into my neightbor's house while I was looking out my bedroom window. So I saw these people, there were two of them, and the one walked inside already and the other was almost inside. But would I stand for that? Of course not! Seeing this happen I wistled, quite loudly, and he kept on walking. So I wistled a second time. This time he heard me and stopped walking and looked around. But, of course, he didn't see me because I was in my room. So that was a little funny.   But now I have nothing to do so I will listen to some music and see if we have Ice Cream. And oh yeah, think about tomorrow. We leave in less than 12 hours! And no, I will not be counting down until I do leave, even I have limits. :)

      I got this story off of AIM.com, you know that window that pops up when you start AIM, the one you always close without reading it. Well today I am really bored waiting for the Yankee/Mets game (at 7) that I am going to talk about this article. Well now that I read the whole article I will talk about something else, the top 5 searches by google. Ah google, the page that comes up when I open up a new Internet Explorer Window.  The top 5 searches are: 5.Canoe Trips 4.Soy Supplements 3.Sassy Sleepware 2.MP3 Downloads 1.Celerbrity Diets.  Is this canoe season? How does Canoe Trips end up as a Top 5 thing that is searched? Did everyone suddenly get a little Lewis and Clark in their minds? Does everyone now was to go where no man has gone before? Into the bold unknown? The only place I am going is in my room when my mom finds out I haven't cleaned it yet.  Soy Supplements?!?! I am looking at the Nutrition Facts for Soy and I see nothing wrong with Soy. But whatever, I probably have my facts wrong.  Sassy Sleepware. Don't get me wrong, I am all for chicks looking hot and it is even better when the are showing some skin in sleepware. But who says the word sassy? The last time I heard the word sassy was on a McDonalds commercial when they said that additional toys were available for children under the age of 3. And the toys were all in a line of toys named Sassy.  MP3 Downloads is understandable, no one wants to pay ridiculous amounts of money for CD's with 12 Tracks. I have paid $20 for some CD's, $1.67 per track. I may have some money, but that is a little much for music. Pssssst if you download go  urlLink here  and download Protowall. Then go  urlLink here  to learn how to install Protowall. It isn't a simple double click on the install button and hit OK a few times. Oh contrair montrair.  And finally Celebrity Diets. Again this is understandable. People are all wanting to look like their favorite clelebrity and such. Even I have given thought to buying Creatine, which is much like a steroid. And the idea isn't totally shot down, but it isn't looking too likely to happen. But it is ironic, most people want to lose weight where I want to gain weight. And you would think with the obesity percentage in this country I would be succeding in my plan to gain weight. Nope, last time I checked I lost 4 pounds, and I am down to 136.  I have successfully written paragraphs about worthless dribble, I think it turned out pretty well. Tonight I have lots of nothing planed, but they Yankee Game is on at 7. And tonight I can't watch my show at 2AM. :( Because I have to get up at 6 tomorrow. Oh well I do have the whole summer. And tomorrow I will be at the Yankee Stadium. And I will be with someone who I wouldn't think for a second of not bringing. Have fun everyone while I get jumped in the Bronx, I'll bring you back a souvenir.

      Here it is, 10:30 and I am posting for the third time today.   Lots has happened since my first post   I think I will invent HTML v.JS where it will include   tags.  So I was sitting down at dinner and my dad broke his bridge, his false teeth but only his top front four, and he called his dentist who didn't get back to him until 10 tonight. So my dad left as soon as he got the call, and he isn't back yet.  Then, yet again, I went somewhere with my grandfahter. But he hurt his back putting in heating improvments to his house. And he took pills, but he didn't know that they would make him sleepy. And on the ride he commented to me about how I don't do anything (duh, it's summer) so he wants me to get a job. And I agree with him. But then my days of sleeping until 12 will be scarce. Oh well, I will be living it up in all the money that I will have. Muhaha.   And today I got more heat from my parents with my attitude. They want me to respect them more. Well I told my dad this, You two will get respect after you stop yelling at me and calling me things like stupid, asshole, and a bastard. Why should they get my respect?  And the fight for High Speed Internet was lost, my dad said to me, why do you need it? And I gave up and said that I didn't need it. So my fight turned to Cable TV. (Yes, I don't have either) But I wont win that because only my dad works and he doesn't want or need another bill to pay.  Right now I am making Jalepeno Poppers. I forgot that I was making them and my mom yelled to me, "James, the oven is ready." Oops. But who can blame me? I was writing this very post. :-D  BTW I am listening to a song I got 24 hours ago and I have played it 36 times already. MY top song is Last Year's Nest by Boy Sets Fire. Yeah, I know, they are the communist band whose CD I blindly bought. Check out these  urlLink lyrics  for a different song, I found them....interesting.   I suppose this is enought for one day. But 12 is only 1 hour and 16 minutes away. And plus, my Jalepeno Poppers are almost done.

      I got bored today, and it is bound to be a long summer, so I decided to make a new journal. First I checked out deadjournal.com to see what that was all about, and I found out, you have to pay. So that idea got scratched. Then I went back to livejournal, too bad for them their website was running very slow and being stupid. So I came to blogger. But I don't think I am staying here, I like Livejournal much better, the options are better there. So this is my 'settle' journal.   I was online today, on livejournal, then I hear the sound my modem makes when it disconnects from the internet. But a second didn't go by after that happened that the phone rang. The caller ID didn't pick up the name, but I got the phone number. So I go back online and go to google and put the phone number into a search. The results? CVS in Glenmont. So I was thinking, why would they call? The call couldn't be of dire importance because they didn't leave a message.  Then I was talking to Erik and he was wowing me with his knowledge of College Football by giving me scores to bowl games from 2 years ago. And while he was doing this I was playing XBOX and I was losing. In what game? College Football. So I was pissed off at the game, so I turned it off. And I haven't picked up the controller since. :)  Then my dad got home and we left to play tennis at the Board. He promptly beat be, with a vengance. I lost 6-1. The key stat: I lost in 19 Minutes!  And before in my day I went to Lowe's for some plywood. Then to Wendy's for lunch. Papermill for my grandfather to pick up the Anniversary cards my grandmother left on the counter there. Then, finally, to CVS to get stuff for my face, and Skittles.  Now I am talking to Susan about how my dog eats fish and Listening to Hey Mercedes. Check out my Profile. Or  urlLink here  is the link, just for  YOU!

      Who would have thought that I would have willingly went to Church? Not only did I go, I liked it. And that means I am going next week. But, I am not too sure they will like me there. There is this one woman who sings, she sings an echo. It sounds like her voice is the sound a crystal glass makes when you rub your wet finger around the the opening. I laughed so hard I cried. It was so funny. Man, did I need to have a good time, and I got it. :-D.

      When I woke up today I thought to myself, July 10th. There is something about today... oh yeah, the milk in the refrigerator expires today. Well the day got a bit more exciting. I spent 20 some minutes at the picnic with my family from my mom's side. If you knew them you would know why I left after that amount of time.   Julianna's gone. Oh well, but I wont talk about her in here. But, lol, after she told me I took the picture of us and put it face down. Lol, it's still down. I'll right it sometime/day/year.  Then I played tennis with my dad, and I did better than usual. And on this one point I ran full speed into a metal fence. And it hurt more than it should have because I forgot where I was on the court.  Right after tennis I got the best news I have heard all summer, I am not eating with my mom's family, I am going to the Olive Garden. That brightened me right up, my dad was pissed that I got to go and not him hehe. I took a shower and I had a noticeable hop in my step. I took the quickest shower I have ever taken, lol. Can you tell I really wanted to go? I was soooo happy that I dressed up for it. I wore black dress pants and a uhhh smooth feeling dress shirt. It's something. And I wore my black ADIDAS's, the ones I never wear, I never tied them :-D. But the food sucked, all of the food sucked. The best part of going there was the fact that I was the best dressed in the place :-D! Actually, the Coke was better than the Pork Tenderloin. They make it better in Manhattan.  Someday I will live in Manhattan and I will be a regular at the Olive Garden. I will always sit in the booth viewing Time Square and the Stock report. And then, of course, there is a window there. Manhattan is my favorite place to be, with Banana Republic and the Gap all with jacked up prices who wouldn't want to be there?  So let me slip away Against the current Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along

      It's been a while, hasn't it? Well my Cooperstown trip got reschedueled to last Saturday. It wasn't a lot of fun and not worth the trip, but I had some fun. There was one exibit in particular that I wanted to see, it is a letter a guy wrote, and I didn't see it so I wasn't too happy about that. And I forgot my camera, so I didn't get to take pictures. And then, lol, I went there with $41 in my pocket. I spent $61. Thank god I have an ATM card. Wait, thank god my dad has an ATM card for my account that I hold. And I am not supposed to use the card for stuff like that, but he won't know it. So I had to take out $20, and I was telling my grandparents this. And they were all dissapointed that I spent that much. So my grandfather, Daddy Warbucks, gave me the 20 I spend back and told me to put it in the bank. And I will, oh I will.  Today was the fourth of July, the birthday of out country, John Sterling (Yankee radio broadcaster), my cousin Bo (who will be here this summer YAY!) and the infamous George Steinbrenner. Queue Empire Theme from Star Wars. And no I am not going to go on a rant about the Yankees payroll and how it is justified and helps the game.  We had a picnic at my other grandmother's house. The one whose husband, my poppy, passed away in August of 1998. At the picnic I saw my cousin who I haven't seen in a while. His name is Tyler and he just graduated from High School. And in a couple of months he is enlisting into the Navy. It was great to catch up with him and see what he has been up to, but I really didn't talk to him and I found myself avoiding him. But he is still a cool guy. : )  So my grandfather died in 1998, when I was only 8 years old. And back then his death didn't effect me, at all. I just saw it as someone who I would not see again, someone who went on a permanant vacation. But one night of last school year I was online talking to Julianna and I remembered something. After he died days after I went with my grandfather and my cousin, Megan, to get ice cream. It wasn't a special trip to make us feel better, it was just the norm. And I remember we were on a bridge that runs over the railroad and Megan pointed a cloud out to me. And I looked at the cloud and I said, "That's poppy." It looked like a man sitting down against a tree fishing. And my grandfather loved to fish. Back then I didn't really care I just thought it was cool that there was a cloud that looked like my grandfather. But that night on the computer I remembered that cloud. And I guess then, almost 6 years later, it hit me, he is really gone. Now, you are probably laughing at me right now. Good for you, you can now click the X at the top left of your browser. And in my computer chair I did something that I didn't do in my life. I mourned over the passing of my grandfather. I cried my eyes out, I cried like a two year old who just had its toy taken away. And Julianna helped me through it. And that was the best, I had someone there to help me through it. Then my dadc came in and yelled at me for being up at 3 in the morning. But the very next day at breakfast I asked my mom, "Are we going to poppy's grave this year." She said, "I don't know, why are you asking." I simply said, "I want to go." And I said it demandingly, like we are going and I don't care if you don't want to. And my mom said, "Okay, we will go." And I don't know what will happen the day my grandmother, my mom and I make the trip up to his grave. But I can count on one thing, my eyes will not be dry. And my mom might understand. But it doesn't matter.  I will try to keep posts more joyous, but I had to get that out. Ahh, it's 12 and I am playing tennis with my dad tomorrow, early. He has the week off. So I am going to be very tired at the end of the week from all of the tennis I will be playing. Goodnight everyone.

      My dad is frowning on me getting a Kawasaki Ninja, lol. I'll end up with one someday.  I have a new best friend, Benza Clin. Yup, that's right.  I am tired of every baseball announcer using the words 'of late.' Why don't you think of something else!?!? Say lately or something. But do not use the same phrase over and over!  I bought my sister this CD a long time ago and I never listened to it. I was at her house yesterday and I made myself a copy of the CD and it's pretty good.  Finally, if it is my time to die then it is my time. What does it matter anyway? There are 6 billion people in the world, why does it matter if I die anyway?
