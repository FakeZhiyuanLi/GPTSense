      Hi, I'm back with more on A Walk to Remember.Yeah I know I'm probably boring you by now but oh well. Jamie and Landon have this great idea top have the dress rehersal at the orphanage. It maybe something different. But when Landon and Jamie got there. They saw Mr. Jenkins and he thought that it wouldn't be a very good idea. mainly because this was an orphanage and Mr. Jenkins doesn't want them remebering that they have no parents on Christmas. You see the play is about a father who comes to realize how much he loves his daughter and that would bring sadness to the childrens eyes. Jamie saw this and said, I never thought of it that way before. So as they were leaving Landon noticed that Jamie was really sad, so he decided to go and see the kids with her. He new that she must want to go and see them so he ofered to let her go. He went in with her. Landon soon noticed how poor this orphanage was, they had little toys, they used newspapers to color oon because they had no coloring books, and the ping pong table had no net. It looked as if it hadn't been used in years. anyway, Landon and Jamie started to walk toward the kids and one of them turned around to see who it was. The little boy screamed out "Jamie" after that all the children turned around and strtedc running toward them. Soem of the kids ignored them because they were to interested in watching the tv that they barely realized that Jamie was even in the room. They couldn't see the tv very well so those that didn't go to see Jamie and Landon moved closer to the tv when oters moved out. Some of the kids thought that Landon was Jamies boyfriend but Jamie soon stratend it out. She told them that he was just a friend. They all had to go after a while. And jamie told the childrent hat she would be back soon. She didn't state whether or not Landon would be there. That was were I stopped reading. Check back tommorow or later this afternoon for updates.

      Wow! Who would think that someone so inocent who be so cold. Well Jamie Sullivan was. Landen Carter had been participating in the school play. According to what he told his frinds. Miss. Garber had forced him into the play but in truth he had actualy volunteered for the part. He was busted. Everyone already thinks that he is going out with Jamie or engaged to her or something. And Jamie is going to make them keep thinking it just to have a little fun. She told Landen that he could come over to her house to practice the lines. Now everyone is really hiot. Jamie has them thinking that they were doping more than just sitting on the porch. I think you know what I mean. Anyway this is supposed to be a suspensful love story. So if you want to read about the rest of the book. Stick around and be hear tommorow. When I continue with the story.

      I am reading this book by Stephen King. Yeah I know what your thinking this girl reads alot of books at one time. But I kinda do you can say that. But anyway back to what I was writng about. I haven't really gotten to any interesting and scary parts yet. A father only just broke his son's arm. That is about it. This book is supposed to be a scary story. But sofar nothing. I guess it is just because I haven't really gotten into the book yet. I'm sure it will become a lot more intersting. Don't you? Stephen King is a pretty good author. If he wrote the Green Mile he must be because that was a pretty good movie. I know there are many parts to that series. How did they fit like 15 books into one movie. I's amazing. Anyway. I hope that this book gets a lot more interesting. My father told me that the movie was really good so maybe it will come around.

      Today we have to write three things in our journals.1) about the Bertram’s Hotel which is the book that I am reading, 2) an article called How Operations Work that we read in class, and 3) an article called “Up Tiddlee Up Up” an article about a flight simulation for the new space shuttle that is occurring today. What can we start with today? I think that I will do the easiest first. That would be the Bertram’s Hotel.  The Bertram’s Hotel  	Today the book didn’t really get very interesting. All that happened was that some guy who was supposed to be a race car driven barged into the hotel looking for Lady Sedgwick. The mans name was Ladislaus Malinowski. And Elvira was asking if she had any money. The answer was yes. So she began asking where it is. What will happen to it if I die? While my husband get it if I die? Is it is a trust Fund? Who is putting money into the trust fund? When will I get the money? And other basic things like that. The guy that she was asking Colonel Luscombe was trying to figure out why Elvira was asking these things now. Why she wanted to know these things? And what brought this all on.

      WEll I don't know what your doing but I am probably just going to sit around the house as usual. I don't really go all ou tfor these kind of holidays. I think they need to have a kids day because we have to put up with the crap or parents tell us to do. No offense Mrs. Cunningham! But truthfuly I think that parents put to much strain on a childs head. Yeah right.Anyway. I don't know aboutyou guys but my parents tell me what to do to much. Do they tell you what to do all the time. anyway I am going way off the topic here. So. I reall yam not doing anything. I will have to deal with my grandparents but you really don't want to get me into that. My grandparents are anything but enjoyable to be around. My grandfather bosses my grandmother around and she does it. He sits in a chair all day and orders everone else to do everything for him. When he comes to my house he kicks us out of the chairs that we are sitting in because he wants to sit in it. He also takes over the tv because "he is the guest he can do what ever he wants." Bull you just don't change the chanel unless you have permission from both adults because soemtimes the parents put the TV on to keep the kids occupied. I just want to slap him. bUt I know that I can't. But do you guys have anything interesting that your doing for fathers day?

      Another R.L. Stine. This should be good. This story is about a girl name Emily who's father died about 4 years ago. And her mother has finaly remarried. Unfortunately Emily doesn't exactly like her step father or her new step sister. Emily new something was weird about Jessie, her step sister. She just couldn't figure out what it was. Lately things have been occuring in the house and Emily has a feeling that it has to with Jessie. She has to snoop around Jessie's things in order to figure it our. One night Emily woke up, I think it was like 2:00 in the morning. She was hearing things and she wanted to find out what is was. When she went down into the kitchen she found her dog stabbed in the chest. She rushed to her mothers room and told her and both the step father and her mother came out running. Everyone was werried. The only person that wasn't there was Jessie. Emily new who was behind all of this. She new Jessie murdered her dog. she also knew that Jessie and her father had something that they were not telling. Jessie has some sort of a dark, secret that she is holding in. Later that year more things started to occur and Emily still was determined to show her mother that Jessie was the one that was the couse of all of them.Emily was still snooping through things to figure out her secret but has turned up empty handed. Untill tonight. Jessie is out with her friends as she tells her father. But Emily new better. anyway. Emily has finally found Jessies diary which Jessie writes in every night.Emily was thinking. Maybe this can tell me something. Sure enough it was. Jessie's exact quote  And I quote, " To bad angel was such a wonderful little girl, Bull I am glad she is dead. I wish Nancy would have killed her before now, she was really annoying me, to bad her family will never find out what happened to there sweet little angel. Ha sweet little girl yeah right. Jus tas Emily was looking up she saw Jessie in the Mirror, emediately she thought that she was dead. Jessie started talking to her, why are you reading my diary, sorry it just fell open. It is okay there is nothingin there that I have to hide. But this say's that you killed someone. This said that Nancy killed angel I was a witness to the crime. But I didn't kill anyone. Why would I do that. After that Jessie and Emily were friends and Emily put the first year with her step sister behind her. She finally learned the truth.

      This is a book by Agatha Christie. I is supposed to be a mystery. Anyway so far Miss. Jane Marple has come to London and wants to stay at a nice old fashioned hotel. What she doesn't know is that Bertram's Hotel is just what she's looking for. It was a hotel built in the 1800s. And it survived wars and old age without a scratch.During wars the buildings around it all fell but that wasn't touched. Miss. Marple desided that that was the perfect place for her to stay even though of it's pricy rooms. Not very scary ha. Just wait Agatha Christie is one of the best horror story writers I have ever read. You should read one.

      This is a really good book. You guys really should read this book. It os about a boy named Landen Carter. He is the president of the student of the senior class. Being part of the student government would be the only way that he would be able to get into the college that he wants to get into because his grades are so low. As the president he has to go to the homecoming dance like the rest of the student government. Unfortunately he doesn't have a date because the girl that he was dating dumped him for a twenty year-old that worked in his fathers auto shop. HA great job right. that is really getting him somewhere. No really it can. But Landen doesn't want to go to the dance alone because he doesn't want to have to mop up puck or stand next to this boy who is the treasurer I don't remember his name. Anyway... Landen doesn't like him very much, he asks to many questions. Landen has asked everyone he can think of even college girls His last chance is Jamie Sullivan the reverands daughter.

      This summer I went on vacation to Disney World. And we got off to a very rough start. We were on I275 and out of no where our tire blows and it had to be on m y side of the car. No I know what your thinking, I did not make the tire pop. Anyway, we were supposed to be at the All-Star Hotel at three o'clock but we didn't end up making it there until five that same night. We had to get a new tire and get some things fixed in the car. We were waiting for like 2 hours. But little did we know that that was only the begining of our misadventure. We got to the hotel and ended up not being able to get into our room becasue our key didn't work. We went sweimming after getting everything unpacked. The next day we went to the Magic Kingdom, it was fun we didn't get to do much because my parents desided that they didn't want to see anything past the castle. So I didn't get to ride anything that I wanted to ride. We went home at noon so that my father could watch the playoffs. We didn't end up going back to the park untill 5 that night. We saw the Electric night parade that started at 9 o'clock, but my dad wouldn't let us go on any rides becasue he thought that we were going to lose our seats. We saw the closing ceramony that night but we weren't able to stay after the fireworks. I wanted to ride my favorite ride it is going to sound corny but I really wanted to ride Dumbo. You have to really know me in order to know why I like Dumbo so much. Anyway. We went home after that because it was getting to late for my brothers to be out. The next morning we stayed at the Hotel all day. That wasn't a very fun day. All we did was go swimming all day. Anyway the next day we went to Down Town Disney. That was heaven for me. I went shopping. Of course it was all disney stuff but still it was shopping. We didn't get anything while we were there because at the time I was kind of broke. I had spent all my money at the Magic Kingdom. WE went home after 9 o'clock That was late when your walking through a 6 mile long mall when you got there at 8 am and hadent sit down the entire day. anyway it was fun while it lasted. On wednesday we went to MGM Studios and we really didn't do that much there ethier. But what I did find out was that MGM has some realy good special effects for there movies.  We went to the Indiana Jones Show and that was really hot in the auditarium that we were in. It was actually like they were really filming the movie. after that I had to wait for hours for my brothers to get all the character autographs they could get. I think I was waiting for them for about a good 2 hours. That may not seem to long but it is when it is 97 degrees outside. Anyway. When my brother came back he started telling everyone that really wanted to go and see Fantasmic and we didn't end up going until the last that we were there. That night it got rained out. After we went to MGM we went to Epcot and for some reason the park you would think would be the most boring asctually turned out to be very interesting. Even though I was on my feet all day again. Walking through the USA portion of the park. Have you ever wondered why they have a section dedicated to the USA when you are in an American park. I would understand if you were in the Tokyo park but your not. sorry I get really anoyedf with the smallest things. But have you ever see the Eluminations it is really cool you should try to see it sometime. I swear the rain has very good timeing because as soon as the Eluminations was over it started pooring. The next day we went to the Animal Kingdon. That wa okay the Kali River Rapids was really cool it got me soaked. Anyway the last day that we were in Orlando we went back to Downtown Disney to buy all of the stuff that we weren't able to buy on Tuesday. I bought an ID Bracelet that I personally had to get inscribed becasue the people that make them are to stupid to think that some one would have the name Krsitine. You would think they would have it spelled both wasy but I also bought a Dumbo stuffed animal. It is so cute. I love Dumbo. You really do have to know me to understand. Well that was the end our journey. Of course I never did tell you about the hotel that we moved to but I wont get into the mis haps that we had there. Oh my god I almost forgot you guys have to go to MGM. The Tower Of Terror and the Rockin Rollar Coaster are so cool. Well gotta run BYE!!!

      Today wasn't a very interesting part of the book eaither. Proffesor Umbridge just told Proffesor Trelawney the divination teacher that she wasn't that good of a teacher and that all she was was a fraud which was also what Hermoine thought as well. She told Harry in the 3rd book that Harry that the grim was mad out of his tree leaves for goodness sakes. Anyway, she was really mad about that so she was slaming books and the desks and throwing the books at the students. as you can see no one likes Proffesor Umbridge she is a faul, cruel, mean woman, who doesn't need to be in the same room as any child. Tahnk goodness she doesn't have her own kids. But getting past that. While Harry was in Potions class with Proffesor Snape Proffesor Umbridge was in there inspecting him. I personaly think that seh is trying to ruin Hogwarts reputation. So far she has said that every teacher in Hogwarts doesn't now what they need to be teaching. They are making the students go way over there leages. Anyway, Harry was in a class with the two teachers that he hates most in the school. Snape was having the students do a potion, I don't remember what it was called, but Proffesor Umbridge didn't think that it was suitable for the students at such a "low level of learning," She told Snape that she was going to have it taken out of the syllabus. Of course Snape was trying to stay patiant with Umbridge as she was questioning him. She asked him How many years he has been at Hogwarts, he said 14 years. She asked him if he has been applying to the defense against the Dark Arts position every years since he first applied. He said yes. Umbridge was having trouble figuring out why Dumbador was not giving him the position becasue every year for the past 5 years they have had a different teacher. The potion that Harry was supposed to be prforming didn't exactly work for him becasue he was to wraped up in what Umbridge was saying That his potion almost exploded. Snape say this and Put a Vanquishing spell on Harry's "potion" and told Harry that he had to do a 1 parchment essay on how to do the potion write and what he did wrong and it had to be turned in the next lesson. Of course that just added on to the Homework he already had for Potions so Harry would have to stay up a few for nights to complete all his work. When he got back to the Common room Fred and George, Ron's brothers, where already attrackting a crowd as usual. They were eating chews that one side made throw up and the other stopped you and they found joy in that. Harr was trying very hard to do his essay but was distracted by all the noise. It was midnight when Harry decided that he would put it up for the night. Just then Serius popped into the fire place just like he said he would. Harry found out that he new that Harry was planning on having a Defense class once a week because one of the people at the Hogs Head had over heard them all talking. That wasn't a very good ending but it will do. TAlk to you soon.

      Today I read a very interesting part of the book. Well not really any way. Remeber that I told you that Proffesor Umbridge was telling all of the students taht they had to ask permission to have clubs or organization. Well what Harry didn't realize was that that ment teams to. So he has to ask permission to have a Qudittch team. Well you can imagion that HArry was mad about that. While Harry was in class Hedwig, Hary's owl that Hadrig gave him for his birthday before his first year, came to Harry's classroom window with a letter from his Uncle Serius Black. Harry noticed that Hedwig was hurt when he took her of the window seal. Her wing was injured. So, to find out what was wrong with her he told the proffesor that he needed to go to the Hospital Wing because he "wasn't feeling good" he went to go and find Proffersor Plat, his magical monsters teacher to see if she could figure out what had happened to her. So he went to the staffroom because he new that she didn't have a class then. She was in the staffroom, but Proffesor McGonigall opened the door and tried to give Harry a detention because he was out of class, but she soon took it back when she found out why he was out of class. Professor Platt ahd told Harry that something had attacked Hedwig. She told him that when Hedwig got better she would not be able to fly long distances for a while. Professor McGonigall had known who Harry was talking to. She new it was Serius Black. Professor Platt told Harry that she would be able to help Hedwig but she would have to stay with her for a few days. So Harry went back to class and Hedwig thought that Harry was giving her away.

      This is actually a very interesting story. The part I am telling you about is acctualy more intersting than I am making it out to be ok. It is when Harry has to put together a defense Aganinst the Dark Arts becasue Proffesor Umbridge didn't want to teach the students defensive spells because she and the ministry of magic think that Proffesor Dumblador wants to make an army to go against the ministry, Dumblador would never want to do that. Anyway so they are not supposed to be making an organization on there own unless they have the consent of Proffesor Umbridge because she is the Inquirior of magic and everything that goes through the school has to go through her first.So they have to find a way to get away with having a class once a week without Umbridge knowing. At the same time that all of this is going on Ron finds out that his sister Ginny is seeing someone hat Ron doesn't like very much but the only reason that he doesn't like him is because he knows Ginny is dating him. Ron is a very protective person and he doesn't want his younger sister dating at such a young age. i told you that it wouldn't seem very interesting to you because you haven't read the entire book. Truthfully I haven't either. HA HA HA HA HA! Anywayz that wasnt suposed to be funny just for your FYI. I really recomend that you read all 5 harry Potter books if you haven't already. I don't think that you should see the movie until you have read the book. The book gives you alot more detail and the movie cuts out like about half of the book. Anyway check back later for up dates on how the book is. BYE!

      Thsi is the best time in my life. I wish I am stuck in a computer lab with a bunch of people that half of them I don't even much like. Anyway. I actually can literaly write whatever and about whoever I want and I won't get into any trouble do to the fact that my teacher won' tsee this thing. I have my 100% privacy. Ok let me see. Later on today I am going to write in here a story that I wrote a long time ago. My friends told me that it was a really creepy story. Maybe you will think so too. Right now I am going through alot in my life and I feel like there is no one that I can talk to. Now I can talk to you because I know that I can trust you. Who are you gonna tell ain't no boby know the email address/webaddress what ever. Look. I am going trough a rough time because my grandmother died and I was really close to her. I mean I new that she was going to die sonner or later but I thought that it would be later not sooner. She had cancer but I never thought that I would actually lose her ya know. I know this is probably very stupid. But when she died like a part of me died with her. And then I have the fact that she died on New Years day. At 3:30 in the morning. It is probably really stupid more me to care but I was really close tho my grandmother. You wanna know something really weird. At least I thought that it was, When my mother was 14 her father died and when I was 14 my grandmother died. Talk to ya tommorow.
