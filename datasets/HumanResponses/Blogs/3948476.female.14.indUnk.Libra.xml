      I dont know what i want...i never do..and i feel like everything i do ends up hurting someone. I wish everything was so simple and everybody got along with everybody..but that will never happen. Im sorry to everyone i have hurt and i dont like it but thats how i am. My life sucks. I have one friend that i can rely on(but i love you amber!), a boyfriend who only talks to me if we are in a fight and would rather flirt with other girls, a family that is slowly but fastly falling apart, and a town where noone will except me for who i am. I can never be myself here because everyone judges me and ive lost some of my friends becasue some people cant except that i am who i am and they cant change me. My sister gets to move back to WA, and my parents never tell me anything that is going on. Sometimes i think it would be better if i just ran away. Dont get me wrong becasue i have lots of friends here that are really nice to me and that i love, but i have to be a screwup and hurt people all the time. Sorry everyone. All i want to do is be normal but it doesnt always work like that. BUT i want all of you to know that I love you guys
