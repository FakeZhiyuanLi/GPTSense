      Ever since about a few hours ago i didnt understand why my father was the way he was, and why he was my father. What did i do to deserve him as my father? Was it just bad karma? Or does things really happen for a reason? Well in my case things really do happen for a reason. There are always lessons behind actions, and lessons that i have to learn at this time in my life, and God never fails with that. He shows me why everything the was it is, and to look beyond whats right in front of me, just by certain actions that take place in ordinary life. This lesson that i learned yesterday took place at church. And lets just say it really hit home.   The subject of the sermon yesterday was Seeing God as a Perfect Father, "perfection vs. reflection". Tom, our lead minister,(who is awesome by the way ;) ) gave this very heart-felt sermon which left me in tears from the beginning all the way to the end. Tom talked about how we all want and need our earthly father's blessing. We yearn for that. And in my case, i knew from that moment that i would be a wreck. We want our fathers love, blessing, active participation, and encoragement. We also want he's spoken belied in who we are and what will will become. Our Perfect Father is the Lord God himself. He is our real father. He makes up for everything our earthly father doesnt have. This is the reason why we have fathers. For the very reason. we need the love , we need the support, and we need their blessing. Its our very instinct that we rely on that blessing to get us through life, to build our self-esteem, to make us know that someone loves us and supports us through life. And when you don't get that blessing, life gets tough. And thats what happened to me.   A.W. Tozer states thats "the most important thing about a person is waht that person thinks about when they think about God." This is one of my standards that i live by. I try and put this into everyday life. Applying it to the people i meet and how i can change their view on the father himself. Show them what an awesome God He really is, and show them what he has done in my life alone, and show them what He can do in there life. Show them that the Lord is our Perfect Father, and that his love for us is endless beyond eternity.  "How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called the children of God! And that is what we are! the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."- 1 John 3:1-2  There are five types of Earthly fathers models. These models are similar but they have there own distinctive qualities. They are: The empowering father, the abusive father, the absent father, the possessive father, and the performances based father. They are basically self explanitory. My father was a mixture of all really. HE was more a abusive and performanced based father though. The performanced based father is when you have to live up to his standards in order to get his love and his blessing, and if you dont succeed at this, then you get the grunt, the cursing and the abuse. (This is so hard for me to write but i feel like i should be, so therefore i am.) You see my father was always like you show me you can do this, and ill give you my blessing. BUt if you screw up along the way your in for a nasty treat. And basically to him, my whole existence is a screw up. But Tom talked about that too. And he showed us that in the bible it actually says you are not accident, that the Lord planned our existence. Basically the core truth in Tom's words is that God is not the reflection of your earthly dad; he is the perfection of your earthly dad. God will always give me the love, the blessing, the forgiveness that im lacking from my earthly father. He will never frown upon nor be distant and angry with me. He knows you even before you were concieved. He made you. To me, this is what i had to hear. I had to know why. why was my father the way he was, why was i his supposive daughter, why did it always feel like it was my fault. Well i know now that all i need from my earthly father is everything i can get from my Perfect Father. I will still keep up everything im doing with my father(e.g calling him, trying to get him to listen to me if i can actually get a hold of him, that type thing..and eventually try and get him to God...it will be a challenge, but im up for it.)  "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who ask recieves; he who seeks finds; and to him that knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if his son ask for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he ask for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you were evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!"- Matthew  7:7-11  This whole sermon was soo overwhelming but i really, really needed it. I needed to know that the Lord was there for me,(i really dont know how to phrase that, but to me its sounds odd) and that it wasnt my fault for the way my fahter was. I needed to know that i was a punching bag for a reason, that there was all a reason for his madness. I needed that closure that i wasnt a screw up, and that i really am cared for. The qualities of a perfect father are; Everything a Perfect father says is   true. everything the perfect father does, is   right. Everything the perfect father hears, he   understands. Everything the perfect father promises, he   delivers on. The perfect father    isnt going anywhere. He will always always be there for you, no matter what. And not all dads are bad. Many of them fit the father profile. But there are many that don't. And there are reasons for that. Just remember the perfect father is always there, with open arms.   "even if my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will   recieve me." psalms 27:10. This passage was the one that hit home with me. It was the closure i needed to get through life. I will always always have that one in my heart. that is the verse that should be publicized around the world for all to hear, Because once i heard it, i knew that all would be alright, for a while. Tom's message really got me throughout the whole thing. He ended it with " The miracle today is that you can leave this place having a BETTER blessing- a blessing from a Perfect father."  Tom had found a "fathers love letter" online and used it in his sermon. It was a letter from God himself, straight from the bible. Its a "cry of a Father's heart from Genesis to Revelation". If you want to check it out go to www.FathersLoveLetter.com   There was really a hidden message in it too. Well for some, they didnt see it. But i saw it. I saw it because i think it was only there for me to see. I saw it because it was actually happening at the same time. And it stood out because of that. God purposely did it for me to recognize it. He wanted me to see that there was someone who physically cared for me and that loved me and wanted to be there beside me through my rough times. And I just want to thank her for staying with me, because believe it or not, shes helped  me keep my cool. Just that feeling of someone sitting next to you and caring for you, its calming. It showed me how much that one person cared, and i needeed it at that time. I know my mom or someone would have hugged me or something, but then i also now there would have been a smart comment that would have ruined the moment. And i just needed one of those long, long hugs that last for life, long after you let go. One of those reassuring its alright hugs/i know that was painful type hugs. I want to let that perosn know that i appreciate her for being there with me through my rough times and to let her know that she is cared for on the opposite end of the chain that bonds us together, and that if she ever needs to talk or just someone to listen that im there for that. She is truely loved for life, and not just by me, by many.   I hope this message gets out to all, and that those people who have that rotten relationship with there father, or jsut really need to hear that there is someone else out there that cares for you. God will always always be there for you, through all times. ever.    Loved by my father,   sam.

      I run my fastest But still get beat i land on my head when i should land on my feet i try to move forward but im stuck in reverse  Why do i keep at it? i won't be left behind  The harder im thrown, the higher i bounce. I give it my all, and thats all that counts.  In first place, myself, i seldom find. So I push it to the limits- I wont be left behind  Some people say you can't. Some say don't. Some simply give up. i reply, I won't.  The power is here, locked away in my mind, My perseverance is my excellence. I won't be left behind.  Make the best of each moment. The future is soon the past. the more i tell myself this,  The less i come in last.  Throughout my competitions i learned what winning is all about,  a plain, clear lesson: Giving up is the easiest way out.  So every night before i go to bed i hope in a small way i have shined tomorrow is a brand new day and i wont be left behind.    I wrote this poem while i was living at my dad's house. It got me through a lot. And sometimes to this day, it still gets me through...piece by piece. but for the little things now. I automatically remember it when im being challenged. From just test to other things that i have to go through in life. But now i have the Lord for my stength to get through. That, and i finally have love, that love that gets you through a lot. The Lord has donnne sooooo much in my life, i am soo grateful to just be alive. He has saved me and made me conquer all my quest. HE can do the same for you to...all you have to do is have faith.    "He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength. Even the youth shall faint and be weary. And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strngth; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." Isiah 40:29-31  Powered By God's strength,   Samalamadingdong.

      I dont really understand what makes my dad the way he is. I think it is that he is lacking a relationship with Christ.(He claims to be catholic, but going to church is a hassle for them and they already claim there going to hell anyways. i dont really understand why he is like that. he supports me in my "church business" as he would call it. He doesnt like how i do it every weekend though, how i love it too. HE thinks church is torture.) I can understand that somehow i've hurt him by moving out of his home but i could not take the unholiness and the uptight "dont laugh your not funny atmostphere, your to hyper for our dry personalities." But what i dont understand is that when i call him, he doesnt feel the need to answer. I mean we started talking again after almost a year in february but before then he Refused to talk to me. I felt horrible. when he finally called me on that special valentines day this year, we agreed that our relationship would get back to normal. We even saw each other on that same day. It was a bit uncomfortable but I managed. I felt like the whole time i was being judged on everything, but i just remembered thats how it was at my dads house. So i started out calling him every other day. And that went well in the beginning, little did i know that he was trying to change the person that i have become. Trying to pull the carpet out from underneath my finally stagnant feet. My foundation was nearly constructed, with tidbits here and there willing to be glued for perfection. So, willing to fill in those holes, i started to listen to him, and change back to the person that i was, little by little. Finally when i realized what he was doing to me, i was in awe of what had happened. I had trusted him. He could not see my happiness through the what he was doing.But the remark from him that made me notice what he was doing was this very phrase: You cant hide behind religion. That killed me. I knew from then on he was trying to murder me and use my body for "the perfect child" in his mind. trying to tell me i wasnt good enough, too fat, and that i lowered my standards, whatever that means. he didnt notice that i finally loved the person who i had become.they couldnt see the change in personality that i have now. I have the Lord. He makes up the light of the world. My Father doesnt understand that everyone needs to have a relationship with Christ. So one day after he got through "the list of everything i need to do in order to become the person who i was in a past life", i just told him; that i didnt like how he was trying to run my life because for once i was on the right road and that i finally found my home in life. I didnt want to change my hair color or lose weight, or kill my personality. I also told him that i wasnt hiding behind my religion, and that it wasnt a religion, it was a relationship with christ. I told him i forgive him for everything he had done to me in the past and that he was only trying to figure out what was wrong with me. and then i told him why i was acting out: I wanted out. I could stand the restraint. I needed God.( i didnt notice it then but i really did need the lord. and i believe he caused me to act the way i was. and i believe he didnt want me there anymore.) He works in extrodinary ways. I knew it then but it didnt really click. The whole time i was being tortured at my fathers house, i was always praying to the Lord to help me and let me find the way out of trouble. Just the little things. Ive never done anything drastic before, so no need to worry about much. just like talking back and disobeying...i never hurt anyone by it...i just needed out.. i was yearning to be loved, and just to be hugged. I was basically in solitary confinment.couldnt talked to anyone in the house without having consequences and the only time they talked to me was when i was "in trouble". no hi or bye, no i love you, no hugs, no love. That when i started to believe that the world for me was over and that no one will ever love me again. ( I think that is half the reason why i am the person who i am now.) My Dad and stepmom took me to my "normal" counsling appts to try to figure out what was "wrong with me". The counselor saw nothign wrong with me. So they decided to talk to my parents(Dad and stepmom, and occasionally my mom) and they'd basically put words in everyones mouth, meaning not being able to fend for myself because they believed my parents over me. (We've had some good times before all this though, so you know my life before wasnt strictly hell. ) And dont get me wrong i love all these people to death, i just dont see why they wouldnt let me be, just listen to me once in my life. LET ME OUT was all i wanted to say. i couldnt understand why they were refraining me back from this world that i wanted to live in. So anyways, back to the story. They told the counselors that they thought i had a variety of disorders such as OCD(obsessive Compulsive Disorder), Bipolar, ADHD, PDS (Post Dramatic Stress),and on top of that ODD(something difiant disorder), when really....all it came out to be was jsut my personality. I believed them for a little bit until i moved in with my mother and noticed that none of that stuff was really true. I just needed out. So that part of my life was  very restrained. That was a bit of background in my life. But really what im trying to get at now is that he wont answer my phone calls. Everytime i call, the answering machine picks up. And im no good with messages. So one day he answered the phone after a few weeks and told me i was going down hill and all that jazz..(when my grades werent good) and that when i leave a message to not say "hey its me" because he has a name. But im not directing the message to just him its basically to everyone. So yeah, im just going to leave it up to God to work on my father and our relationship. Just have to have faith and not rush myself because these things take time right? right. HEy ive notice that this thing is a good counselor. :) maybe i should tell them that i found one....theyd probably put me in for sessions again. ANNNNNYYYWHHHOOO... So im just going to live life the way i have been. Maybe he thinks that not talking to me will bring me down....hmmm... never thought of it that way. I have no clue what really brought this on to write about this but somehow it all just poured out. Dont really know what to do..there isnt much. I just keep calling and praying.   Well...   " Then Peter came to Him and said,"Lord how often shall my brother sin against me, and i forgive him, up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, " I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."- Matthew 18:21-22.

      Today i had finals. I have been praying and praying all week for them to be easy enough for me to pass and for me to have the wisdom to understand what im doing and to be able to let this week pass by comfortly without stress. I totally put everything in God's hands, leaving it up to him to carry me through all of the exams. Well ive gotten through two today, actually 1 4/5 but i can finish that up tomorrow because of my charming witts--and of course her not knowing how long she made the test. but all in all, i feel pretty good about them. there are 2 advantages to Giving everything to Christ to handle and having faith that he will pursue. One- It is A LOT less stressful then holding the world up on your own 2 shoulders. and two- It pleases the Lord.  "But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him"- Hebrews 11:6  The bible talks a lot about having faith and about people who had faith. In the world, you don't often see much faith. In fact, some people are negative almost all the time. Any time you presented them with a big idea, they will start rattling off reasons why it wont work automatically. That's not faith.  In order to please God, you've got to have faith. You've got to be sure of "the substance of things hoped for" and to believe in what you can't see. God does give people dreams and ideas; and most of the time they seem bigger than your abilities and resources. He wants you to be absolutely positive that he can make it happen.  Start by believing in the bible. Faith can really grow as you begin to get confident in  His Word. Dont just memorize some verses. Get them into your heart. Try them and let God show you he means business. He's good for His Word. Believing Him is crucial, and no one else can do it for you. You have to develop your own faith and determine not to be shaken. You'll see it work and Gow will be pleased.  "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a Good testimony. By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things that were seen were not made of things which are visible."- Hebrew 11:1-4  "behold the proud, His soul is not upright in him; But the just shall live by his faith." - Habakkuk 2:4  "Have faith in God."-Mark 11:22  "Your faith has saved you. go in peace." Luke 7:50  " watch, stand fast in faith, be brave, be strong.Let all that you do be done with love." - 1 corinthians 16: 13-14  "For we walk by faith and not by sight." - 2 corinthians 5:7  "We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of everyone of you all bounds towards each other, so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in your persecutions and tribulations that you endure."- 2 thessalonians 1:3-4  "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses."- 1 timothy 6:12   Carried by christ,  Samantha.

      The One Person...   Underneath all your tears there is always that one person who heals your insides they help you mend your open wounds And are there to comfort you through the times those painful severs cant be bonded Even when you think the pain wont go away that person will be with you and will never let you go astray.  With just there soothing trustful words and there serene comedic charisma they help with even the littlest innocent issues  that one person will always be  that one person who will never not be there for you  in any situation  Theres is that one single person  who when all say failure she says success  She will believe in you through every task you will undertake she will always build up your self esteem just by saying hi. for it is such an honor  to have that person in your life  That one person is the one of the two who is or will be  pulling you through  So i pray now for you to find that one person in your life that person will be a godsent.  How do i Know all this?  Because i have found that  person and she is truely  sent from the Lord God Himself.    The person who inspired me to write this poem is that special person. She has been and i know she will always be there for me even when i go off to college and move to austrailia :P(shes probably thinking that will never happen...hahahha) you just have to know me to understand what that comment was about. but anywho. she knows who she is and so therefore i wont mention her name. (IN any case, "she" can be replaced with "he", but in my life it was a she so that influenced the poem) Till next time....  "Let not Mercy and truth forsake you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on a tablet of your heart, And so favor and high esteem in the sight of God and man."- Proverbs 3:3-4   Keep the faith strong,  Sammie.....
