       INFERIORITY;JEALOUSY   *Note:  please excuse me for my messy blog entry. My mind is in a mess   Since year 2002, after a "dramatic" incident, I developed a weird sickness, a heart disease. A sickness only known to some as "Inferiority". It took me an entire year to "solve" the problem, or shall I say resolve the conflict. Who knew, things took another turn on me again. Though it is not a exact repeat of history, but I am feeling the same way I did 2 years ago. The cold cold feeling. Cold. That incident caused me to do some serious thinking of my own. In the beginning I was blaming everyone. Everyone; including my cousin.  I even broke off any relationships with the group. Eventually, I left church and sought temporal refuge at another church. Anyway, I eventually decided it was me that should change and adapt to the rest. I tried listening to chinese radio stations(cause I always listen to english ones), watch tv shows, "chase" idols... but now, I realised that my effort hasn't paid off much.  During this retreat, a certain incident caused me to recall bad memories of the past. This incident also caused me to fall into further retreat and ponder on many questions and thoughts that ran through my mind. The incident to the re-appearance of Andy.   The memory   About 2-3years ago, Alan(Ena's malaysian cousin) came to Singapore to visit. He joined us for quite some time. On a particular Sunday, the group was having difficulties about where we wanted to go after cell. After an hour or so, my morale was rather down. Alan asked me where we were going or have we decided where we wanted to go, so I replied no. He said he was going home to sleep... so I said ok. Not long later, the group finally decided where we wanted to go. Just as we were on our way to the bus-stop from church.. the girls began asking where Alan is. I told them what happened just now. Suddenly, ok maybe not really suddenly, Joycelyn began reprimand or scolding or blaming me for chasing Alan away or something like that. That really hit me hard. Real damn hard. If I did not recall wrongly, I think the rest of the girls were also not very happy about me "chasing Alan away". Overwhelmed by emotions, I cried. Why? Because I realised then, that I was insignificant. I felt un-important. I felt as if my presence was extra. (Sorry, take break, bad memories causing me to cry again) This was one of the many incidents that caused me to leave church to seek refuge else where.   One of the many things I realised about myself is my insecurities. Insecurities of having a lack of self-confidence. I feel inferior of myself. Insignificant. I daresay, that compared to the other guys, I am neither as good looking as them, nor fit, nor humorous or even talented. I see myself as a worm among the dragons in the sky. I see myself as a person that isn't nice to be with. People ask why I don't like taking photos, simple reason: I hate seeing myself in photos. Why, cause I think I look horrigible.  As I sat at the hotel lobby with the group, Andy appeared. "Shuai ge". "Handsome right?". These phrases kept sounding in my ear. Not only from the girls, but even from myself. This was where my inferiority stepped in. Ever since that day, I never felt happy. I can't say its Alan fault. I can't say it was the girls fault. All I could say is it was my jealous and inferior heart at work.   In church, it is known that Joycelyn and WeiWei,Steph and Oliver,Mich and her stead,ShiShi and her stead..Eric and his humorous,attractive self.. All of those guys had their talents... WeiWei,Oliver and Eric could play the guitar darn well...The steads could play pool and billiard well... All these talents, I do not have. All I have, is my two eyes. My two eyes that see the group always happy together, always able to communicate well, always have a great one-on-one bonding with each other. Even if it were my cousins, I still could not have or develop such a close relationship. Seeing the members of the group able to have so much fun. Seeing them having fun while I'm not around. To me, I am not even comparable to the younger ones. Ziming was much taller and handsome than me, Thomas & DX has the ability to make people happy, Daniel had the ability to play the keyboard. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel myself as a failure. In conclusion to this part, I see myself as nothing. Inferior,insignificance...  I can say that, while I am with the group, I could never see them having any real fun. It is only till that I leave that they have fun. Even if i'm wrong about this, I can still say that they still have fun whether I am around or not. my presence is extra. a waste of space, air... an obstruction. An illustration:  Relationship:  Me             |--------------| Group Me             |----| Any member of the group Any member     |---------------------------------------------| Any member(s)     I went into some deep thoughts during the retreat. These are my thoughts:  1) Am I too proud? or am I acting proud? 2) Why am I unable to reach a level where I can communicate with the group "intimately"? 3) Am I detestable to be with? 4) Am I unwilling to open myself up and thus express myself? 5) Am I trying to gain sympathy? 6) Do I truly understand myself? 7) Am I expecting something?   3)--> Thats how I always feel. I feel that I am not fun to be with. 5)--> No. I am not trying to gain sympathy, because I really feel inferior to others.  Whenever I am away from the group, I feel as if they're talking behind my back.   I've got alot of incidents from the retreat where I can elaborate on my topic of this blog entry, but I think i'll pass.  Yes, I do get asked why I feel so low. But.. to me.. it is an act.. an act which I feel, that.. that.. arrgghh...  Simply in conclusion, I feel jealous. Jealous of everybody. Jealous of how everybody can have fun while I cant. Jealous of looks, personality, character... Simple just jealous.    This is my personal struggle. I'm not sure if I should go into further retreat. A break. A time to think. To think if I should: 1) leave again(for good) 2) try harder to change(and fail) 3) wait for miracles Whatever it is... I don't really give a fuck. I feel rotten. A rotten apple among the fresh.    simply just... Jealous  and  Inferior
