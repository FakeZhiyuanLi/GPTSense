       urlLink Lookie!  Michael Moore's newest film, Farenheit 9/11 has not only broken the record for the highest grossing documentary of all time, in one weekend, it reached #1 at the box office playing on one third the screens as the next closest movie, the unforgivably horrible White Chicks.

      Well the aforementioned s***head just made the WORST Freudian slip ever.  Now the other friend, his girlfriend?  Her name is Gwen, for the record.  The s***head told me he'd give me back my Desperado DVD because he wanted to watch The Matrix Revolutions with Gwen.  Wait a second, he's trying to bang many people... but surely not GWEN.  Hell I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole!  Chris immediately went "WHAT?!" and proceeded to whale on Travis (S***head) before my very eyes.  Travis claimed he meant the "other" Gwen, who isn't even named Gwen.  In fact, she's named Yara, which is far from Gwen, in my mind.  I don't know what alternate dimension one must live in to translate Yara as Gwen, but it is somewhere out of the realm of my understanding.  Now here's something about this other one, lets just say she dresses like the worst of harlots, and NO ONE but a rapist (literally) would EVER touch that thing.  I told him that either way it isn't exactly a good statement, given that he MEANT to say "Jennifer" which is even FURTHER from Gwen... Anyway, I apologize for the triviality of this post, but I thought it was a rather funny slip.  (Update: Chris is now outside chasing Travis, trying to punch him, after they read this post, they both pulled knives when they read it, well, Travis pulled a knife, and suggested they kill me.  Fortunately, I have a giant sword, and as such, I had reach.  No one is hurt, it was just a joke.  This is what happens when I let my friends read what I write about them... Violence.)

      I have a few friends, right?  We were all gonna go see Farenheit 9/11 today, as I said yesterday.  Well, we're not going, why?  One friend had to talk to his girlfriend for umpteen hours, the other is just a s***head.  Oh well, we'll go tomorrow.  I'm not upset, I just write this to be comical.  I'll let you know how good it is tomorrow, HOPEFULLY.

       urlLink Here.   I have been a follower of Michael Moore's work for some time now, and some months ago I visited his website, to find that it contained some excellent news stories about current events.  He also has an action alert system, much like MoveOn or TrueMajority.  Use these, that is if you agree with what he says, if not, ignore them because it'll piss you off.

       urlLink Tycho  of Penny Arcade has once again released a news post that I find worthy of perusal, seeing as he talks about one of my favorite games, City of Heroes.  Those who play the game should give it a look.  Found it interesting that the man plays a Dark Defender, quite similar to my own Defender.

      How about politics?  I intend to go see Farenheit 9/11 tomorrow, and if you choose to say something negative about me like "You bleeding heart liberal!  Go kiss Osama!" I say to you this:  You were not elected legitimately sir, but I do respect the office, even though you have made a mockery of it.  For those who don't get the reference, go out and buy Al Franken's  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them .  Great book.  I'll pop back in with a mini-review of  Farenheit 9/11  tomorrow.  Oh, and I got a Gmail account to cut down on the bs that gets shoved into my CtrlAltDel inbox.  Completely unrelated, yes, but who honestly cares, this is the internet, and since when have people on the internet cared about consistency.

      Hmm, my comic seems to have everything going for it, except of course that it doesn't have an artist.  Everyone I show the scripts to likes it, but no artists have come forth!  What is wrong with this world...

      Hello, some of you may know me, most of you do not.  I am the one you will forever know as A. Zimmer.  This little pointless space on the internet is a repository for my mindless thoughts and brain dumps.  You may like it.  You probably will never return here.  Either way, welcome.

      I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 today... Was amazing. What was even more amazing however, were the massive crowds gathered to enter the showing.  I kept track:  Fahrenheit 9/11 had a crowd of 43 people  Spider-Man 2... 11 people.  Take THAT Peter Parker!  Well on with the post.  It was an excellent movie.  Funny, moving, compelling.  I loved it.  It shocked even ME at points, And I've read Michaelmoore.com since his latest book came out!  Everyone needs to see this movie.  I nearly screamed when a tearful woman was harassed on the streets of DC for conversing with an Anti-War person, even when she herself had lost a son in Karbala.  This is indeed a sad, low point in American History.  Thank God people like Michael Moore exist to fight the, to use one of The Smirk's terms, evildoers.  Four Stars.

      Those of you who know me, know I own one of 5,000 Anduril swords made by United Cutlery.  It hangs on the wall next to my bed, which has never been a problem until tonight.  Not five minutes ago, a pillow bumped the tip of my sword, knocking one of the supports away, and setting it swinging wildly inches above my face and leg.  I managed to catch it mere seconds before it fell, almost certainly on some part of my body.  That'll get your heart pumping!

      In this conversation with my friend Nick following seeing someone in #machall talk about the Elves, Nick ties all of science fiction together, including Tolkien, Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, X-Men, Batman, and Superman.  PsykoDemun: Yes, well, we all know the force is elder magic and the sith were really the vulcans who went to a new galaxy to escape the anti-elven sentiments that finally caught up with them once earthlings made it into space that they fled from using goblin powered crankshaft driven super duper ion drives Andrew Galan: haha PsykoDemun: yeah PsykoDemun: take that PsykoDemun: oh PsykoDemun: and the mutants PsykoDemun: we can't forget the mutans PsykoDemun: see Andrew Galan: hahahahaha PsykoDemun: A few lingering elves blended into human society and inter-bred.  The magic become more instinctual, as opposed to a practiced art, and eventually the latent genes came out creating mutants. PsykoDemun: yessir PsykoDemun: and the shi'ar are an offshoot of the vulcans who died out before man went into space on a large scale. PsykoDemun: at least so it's rumored.  Of course they could have fled to the darkness of space, and become the evil guys in b5. PsykoDemun: whose name escapes me Andrew Galan: hahaha PsykoDemun: cause you know Andrew Galan: Shadows? PsykoDemun: yeah PsykoDemun: that's the evil shi'ar PsykoDemun: formerly of the vulcans PsykoDemun: while the vorlon(sp) are the good side PsykoDemun: also formerly of the vulcans PsykoDemun: formerly of the elves PsykoDemun: later to be the sith PsykoDemun: see PsykoDemun: it's all tied together Andrew Galan: haha PsykoDemun: you know i'm right PsykoDemun: it's too crazy to not be true Andrew Galan: And its all in an alternate universe because Star Wars happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away PsykoDemun: see PsykoDemun: but lucas wrote that PsykoDemun: and lucas is actually a time traveller PsykoDemun: he comes from a distant future PsykoDemun: where the elves are all but extinct PsykoDemun: and man has devolved PsykoDemun: losing all sense of plot and storytelling PsykoDemun: and he came back to spread this "superior" form of living PsykoDemun: then he found peyote PsykoDemun: and the rest is movie history Andrew Galan: hahahaha PsykoDemun: what else can i tie in... PsykoDemun: oh yeah! PsykoDemun: batman PsykoDemun: see, batman has elven blood PsykoDemun: and in some instances it causes insanity PsykoDemun: in other cases, superiority complexes PsykoDemun: but fortunately batman is neither of those PsykoDemun: he just kicks a lot of ass PsykoDemun: while waiting to be reunited with his long lost relatives PsykoDemun: a la vulcans/sith/shadows/vorlons PsykoDemun: and superman is part of a slave race created by the elves PsykoDemun: the manipulation resulted in the enhanced abilities under our sun PsykoDemun: thus they based the species on a planet under a different sun type PsykoDemun: to keep them under control PsykoDemun: and all elves are hermaphrodites PsykoDemun: just you wait PsykoDemun: in five years PsykoDemun: a hermaphrodite sith who used to be a shadow but really wanted to be a vorlon who great grandparents were vulcans but missed being elves and frolicing naked in the woods of wales will land PsykoDemun: and claim earth as his/her new fiefdom PsykoDemun: and then everyone will get together PsykoDemun: and have a fiefdom feast  Yes, it all becomes clear to me now.

      I cannot believe how many people have never read a word of Tolkien.  After three films, countless marketing blitzes, and over twenty Academy Awards... Most people have never read the books.  Why is this true?  It might be because Tolkien is a dry read.  Well I say this.  Pick up ONE of the three Lord of the Rings books, Return of the King, and read ONE section.  The Battle of the Pelennor Fields.  Then tell me Tolkien is dry.  You'll appreciate that attention to detail when he's describing the charge of the Rohirrim before the walls of Minas Tirith.  And if you want a short sample of Tolkien's brilliance?  Here is a poem from The Fellowship of the Ring, entitled The Riddle of Strider...   All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, Alight from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken: The crownless again shall be king.  --J.R.R. Tolkien   Tell me that doesn't move you.  Tell me that is a bad poem not worth the paper it is written on.  Simple, short, and beautiful.  Inspiring even.  In case you missed it, here it is again, this time in Sindarin Elvish...    Pân i valt law thilia, Law pain i reviar mistar aen; Iaur i vell law thinnatha, Law thynd dyfn na-niss rathar aen. O lith naur echuiathar aen, Calad od dúath thuiatha; Adamminen i vagol vreithannen, Pen-thôl ad echannen i aran.  --J.R.R. Tolkien    Tolkien was a brilliant linguist as well.  He invented not one, but two languages: Quenya and Sindarin.  And pieces of several more, including Black Speech.  Read Tolkien, you'll thank me for it.

      I just got an odd phone call, from a noticably irate spanish women, who started screaming for a "Rachel" or something like that.  I didn't do anything except hang up, but in retrospect it might've been fun had i done something like  urlLink this .  Back again and dance Mr. Bojangles...

      Aside from the Asian lady singing the song, Spider-Man 2 was amazing.  Yes, I saw it, INSTEAD of Fahrenheit 9/11, which I shall see this weekend.  The basic premise of the film entails Peter Parker's identity crisis.  His powers begin to wane when he rejects the Spider-Man mantra "With great power comes great responsibility."  It is by far the most touching and heartfelt Superhero movie ever made, most likely the greatest superhero movie ever made period.  I would rate it above the first in terms of quality.  I was giddy during the opening credits when I saw that one of the screenwriters was none other than the Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Michael Chabon.  I knew I was in for a treat when I saw not one but two fans in full Spidey regalia in the audience.  I was heartbroken when Peter Parker forsook his alter-ego.  And I was absolutely thrilled when I heard Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson utter the classic line: "Go get em' tiger."  I'll post some comments of more in depth scene reviews for those who wish for spoilers.  In the meantime, SEE THIS MOVIE.  Four Stars.
