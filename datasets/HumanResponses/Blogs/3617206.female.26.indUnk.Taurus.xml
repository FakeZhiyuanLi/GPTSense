      On pyhapaev 13. juuni. Ilus kuupaev. Ilus ohtu . Nii voikski koik alatiseseks jaada. Kuid oh ei . Mu 4,5 aastasel tytrel oli 28 ndal mail operatsioon. Tema ajust opereeriti 7x5x2cm suurune  halvaloomuline kasvaja PNET.  Kui me midagi kiiresti ette ei vota kasvab see kuratlik ollusk tagasi

      Hommik oli ok. Soin oma kaerahelbe pudru ilusasti ara. Siis  otsustasime Reginaga kinno minna. Ta arvas et Catwoman on ideaalne valik- tema ja tema maitset.  Ja toesti ei pidanud pettuma.  nii mulle kui ka talle meeldis see film. Soovitan koikidele.  Peale seda tahtis ta MCdonaldsi Chicken McNuggetseid saada . Ja no muidugi sai kah. Kes  andis??/ IKKA MINA!!! Siis tulime tagasi RMH ja ma hakkasin tuba koristama. Vaja kord  majja saada enne kui selle  majaga hyvasti jatan. Oli meie kodusk kuus nadalat. Ja loodan et kui sygisel tagasi Chemot tuleme tegema ei pea siin motellis elama. Kuid siiski tanud Ronald McDonald stuffile et tasuta elada saime. :)  Tana oli Big Scoop Ice Cream festival, millele me muidugi ei lainud. Selle jaatise festivali eesmark on RMH jaoks raha teenida.  peale seda festivali oli jalle yks grupp inimesi siin ja tegi kogu majale ohtusoog. Ma  olin jube naljane kuna  kaerahelbepuder oli juba ilusasti seeditud ja peavalu  naljast oli talumattu. :( Nii ma hakkasingi sooma. Riisi ja brokoli pilaff, kana pada kreemi kastega ja PALJU MAGUSAT- 2 tykki kreemi pirukat, 2 tykki pecani pirukat, kypsis ja palju jaa teed. :( Ma toesti olen kurgu laeni tais. Jube vastik tunne on. Miks ma kyll nii teen. Lubasin endale et alates eelmisest esmaspaevast olen dieedil et kaotada need 5 kilo mis ma siin juurde votsin, aga mitte kuidagi ei saa otsa peale. SOok lausa kisendab mu nime. DIANA TULE JA SOO MIND, DIANA PALUN. .... Loodan et selle kuu mis ma kodus CAs veedan saan ilusasti otsa peale  need yleliigsed lbsid maha.

      TEisipaev oli pikk ja vasitav paev. REgina tundus samuti rohkem vasinud kui&nbsp; varematel nadalatel. Ta verenaitajad on kyllaltki normis&nbsp; mis tahendab seda et ta ei pae paevast paeva maskiga ringi jalutama.  Eile&nbsp; ohtul kais Ronald McDonaldi majas&nbsp;&nbsp; Mingi grupp. Lapsed varvisid valgeid seinaplaate ja ka mingid ajakirjanikud olid kohal. Tehti pilte ja soodi Pizzat. Reginale piltide tegemine ei istunud. Ajas oma huuled prunit Ja ytles&nbsp; EI iga asja peale. Ma olin yritamisest labimarg. Fotograaf tahtis meist molemast pilti saada aga Regina Ei vaadanud Fotograafi poolegi. :(  Tana kolmapaeval&nbsp; on tal Ocupational&nbsp; Teraphy ja siis kell 1 kiiritus.  Homme neljapaeval on pikk paev&nbsp;&nbsp; ja&nbsp; arvatavasti ka vasitav paev. :( Ja Reedel tuleb NICK!!!! Yey

      NICk tuleb Reedel ja jaab nadalavahetuseks. :) COOL!! Ei joua reedet ara oodata. Kui reginale ytlesin siis ta vaatas mind vaheke imelikult ja pani hea killu, " Aga Issi ei ela ju meiega enam". Irw.&nbsp; Ega ei ela jah enam, aga ainult ajutiselt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pool aastat peame praktiliselt ilma "meheta" elama. Aga noh,&nbsp; need haigla paevad mooduvad yllatavalt kiiresti. Hommilul kell kaheksa haiglasse, ja kella 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ajal tagasi. Olenevalt paevast muidugi.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Olen siin hullumoodi sooma hakanud. I SWEAR!! Nalg on kogu aeg. Koik soovad siin ja ju ma siis votan selle endale vabanduseks et kui teised soovad , miks siis mina ei voi.&nbsp; JA usu mind, sook on hea- mitte salat - VAID SOOK!!! Grillitud kana, Texas roasted beef, brisket, jne. Taisvaartuslik Rasvane " SOuthern ' Toit.&nbsp; Kui ma siin ainult salatit ohtusoogiks soon siis moni tuleb ikka juurde ja uurib kas minuga on koik korras. Et akki tahan ikka liha, ja neil yks ekstra jupp grillimas. IRW. Ma olen juba umbes 5-6 lbs'i juurde votnud? Palju veel ? Jargmise kuu jooksul jargmised 6 lb?? Jousaalis kamisest ei tule siin ju midagi valja.&nbsp;&nbsp; lapsehoidjat pole ja pole kedagi kes Regina jargi vaataks. Teeme kyll siin jalutuskaike, aga mida sa ikka 100 kraadise kuumusega teed. 5 Minutit jalutust ja siis oleme labi marjad, ja Regina ei tohi ju erilise kuumuse ja paikese kaes ka olla. &nbsp; OK. Mu aeg on Otsas. Jargmise korrani.

      Oleme siis nyyd neljapaevast saati kodus olnud.  Nii hea ja rahulik ja niii palju ruumi. :)  Reginal tundub vaheke igav kuna koolis ta ju ei kai( ei tohigi), uued mangukaaslased jaid memphisesse ja Gabrieliga ei saa ka ju koigest raakida ja koiki mange mangida. Eile oosel magas Regina oo oma parima sobranna Heatheri pool . Hetheri ema ytles et nad myyd ei teinud kui ainult mangisid   ja raakisid ohtu labi - kuni 12ni oosel. Ainus asi mida ta teha ei tahtnud oli sook. Soogiga on meil jah probleeme. Soob teine nagu linnukene- snack , snack and snack... Loodame et asi paraneb ja et ta kaalust maha ei votaks.

      Tana siis koristasin oma tuba. Pakkisin asjad, tellisin Regina  keskliini jaoks vajalikud hooldusvahendi, ( systad, kreemid, plaastrid Etc). 2 korvrit on asju pungil tais ja  veel seljakott, ja Regina kott .   2 Suurt kastitait asju soidutasin Juba Target House, et ei peaks neid CAsse kaasa vinnama. ( manguasjad jne).  Regina ei joua ara oodata millal koju saab.  Ta ka pakib oma seljakotti vaikselt. Nii naljakas on vaadata kuidas RMH rahvas valja vaheldub. Koik vanad naod on peaaegu kadunud ja uued on asemele tulnud. Paljud on saadetud koju paariks nadalaks kuni 6 nadalaks puhkama, moned on ravi lopetanud ja laheb hasti,  kuid on ka neid kes on lainud koju oma armsamate sekka et loppu oodata..... kurb. :(  Reginal laheb ikka veel hasti. Tana oli ta vaheke vasinum kui muidu .  Louna ajal kaisime Chilis soomas. Ta tahtis Pizzat ja Corn dogi. Corn dog talle ikka ei maitsenud kuna oli LIIGA pruun ???? Tema ja tema tahtsmised.

      All this stressing around ... I woke up  yesterday unable to move my left side. My BACK is killing me.   Pain is unbelivable from neck to  middle back.  When it rains it pours.  And it's been pouring past month. I want to see sunshine  and  wake up and our lives are back to normal.   At least I can dream about it. :)

      2 more days before me and my daughter Regina will travel to Memphis , Tennessee.  On May 28th she had operation to remove 7x5x2 cm malignant brain tumor called PNET.  Now we have to go to St Judes to get her Radiation started. She'll get 5 weeks of radiation- 5 times a week. Then we get to come home for a month and then we have to go back to get started with High dose Chemotherapy.

      Today was MRI day. We did  not get to see the resaults yet. But hopefully on Monday we'll know if her little head is clean.  Also on Monday shell get Central line. :( She'll hate it for sure. :( Then on tuesday she gets more bloodwork done and, on wednesday she'll het her first Radiation treatment. Praying, and praying and praying for the best.  Today we finally rented a car and took a drowe around the  hood. IT's nicer  away from here. We went to applebees, and Sears and little mall close by.  Regina was exited. SHe liked being away from RMD.  Tomorrow we'll go to Graceland and  on sunday we'll have fathers day lunch, because my husband is going back to CA . My son nees some attention also. He'll forget how his mom and dad look. He allready does not want to talk to me on phone. :(   I'm getting scared.  I don't know what to expect. I do,nt know how will she react to her treatment. I dont want her to suffer.

      We are here.  It's hot and rainy and humid and all the things same time. So different from CA weather.  We are staying to Grizzly house for a week and  on tuesday( I hope) we get a room in Ronald McDonald house.  I'm not really happy with the neighbourhood  but oh well, the things we do and places me move for our childrens well being.  I think I had to explain REginas story LIKE 100 times today. How it's started, when it's started, how many times she threw up, other symptoms, other siblings living in our house.... But everybody is SUPER nice here and seems like REgina adjust well.  She still does not want to be poked....

      IT was really  whiny day today. REgina was whining, Gabriel was whining I felt like whining and screaming same time because nobody listened to me.  And all this whining just makes me hungry. I never felt this way before- I mean Hungry all day along. And If I did not get food righ away I felt really dizzy. IT's really really weird feeling. I get hot all over my body and  then I suddenly get so hungry I could eat away everything  I see.  I hate feeling like this.  But on a happier note- One of my online friends made Regina beautiful Quilt. Purple, green and yellow colors. It's   B E A U T I F U L !!! I swear.  I wish I had quilt like this  :) Maybe I make it one day....

CAN I RUN, I really need to go to potty!" Me:" Go ahead" bump, bump bump, bump... HAhaha. I wish she would ask  this kind of questions every time she does something she is not allowed to. :D

      Regina is watching tv. We had more friends visiting today. She got MORE princess stuff.  Princess, princes, princess princess- PINK PINK purple PINK. Don't get me wrong. I love pink  and purple and Red.  But to much on same time is just TOOOO MUCH PINK!!!! And I think this PINK mania Is making me hungri. I was down to 135 lbs. Now, within a month I gained 5 lbs. I want to go to gym, but I just have no positive enerty to do so. I was gym junkie. I went there every day, I worked out with trainer . I, I , I , I . But now I need to think about her. And eventually my well being is not so important anymore.   My sweet little pink princess needs more attention and care than ever before. I think I'm stressing out way to much about everything. I think about FUTURE, and not knowing what will happen in 1, 2....6 months scares me. I don't like to live in darkness. I want to KNOW  now. I want to know why  her. I demand to know why not me. Somebody said that god punishes our children for our mistakes? I just want to know what have I done wrong so far? I love her to much? Is that the case??

      I broke down and cried today.  Regina woke up this morning  and told me that her troat hurts and she is weak.  Me , of course got really worried . around 9 am she had her another IQ test done. And let me tell you about that test. IT WAS HARD. She is only 4 years old but  questions she got asked  were hard for me to answer. She had to remember sentenced  she had to READ OUT LOUD 6-7 word senteces,( of course she could not do that) she is only 4 years old. She got really frustrated and started to cry. And I started to cry. And after 1 hour some stupid testing we finally got to go  and it was time for her radiation treatment.  we had to wait there for 2 long hours. We saw nurse first because I told them that regina complained some pain and weakness. She got some medications to controll that. and then ,  when they sedated her  because she can  not lie down  without movement I started to cry and I cried about 2 hours. Of course everybody was asking if they can do something to make me feel better  and if they can get me something. But I just wanted it all go away  and I wanted  to wake up and see that it was all one bad nightmare. :(  Finally one of the  sedation nurses came to me and spoke at least 25 minutes and It helped.   I finally calmed down and  it was time to go to recovery room and get her because she had just woken up. Thanks to Pam who's been working in ST jude for 27 years and seen everything( including crying psycho mothers) I stopped crying :)  Now it is 7 pm and I feel little sick. I think I cryed to much :) Regina is doing better. she had her dinner and dessert and is ready to do some crafts. :)

      I don't mind smokers. I was smoker once.  You know, I smoked 5-6 ciggis per day. SOmetimes 10, but never more.  HEre in RMH  almost everybody smokes. I swear. Even 3 month old babies.  Close your eyes,   imagine you are that 3 month old, You are sittin on your mamas lap. Around you  are lot of people who all are smoking. Lot, I mean 7-8 persons. THey smoke, and smoke and then they light up new ciggy and smoke again. WHAT?? Guys! COme on. If you dont care about your life care about your little boys life who is allready getting Chemo treatments. :(  I feel sad.  ( I never smoked around my kids, and if They happened to come around I threw the cig. away , brushed my teeths and even changed my clothes. I did not wash my hair. 7 times a day - its way to much.  Like I said before, I don't mind  people who smoke but  do it  on right place and when small sick kids are not present.

      Tomorrow, 9.30 my sweet little girl will get her first Radiation treatmnent. Her MRI showed no signs of Tumor growing back which means she does not need high dose radiation. :) News like this make me really happy.   Her little bones are getting a last scan now and tomorrow before her treatment we'll see eye doctor and check her  hearing as well. I'm exited about treatment getting started. :)

      Everything went well . And her MRI was also good. No signs of tumor growing back :)))) Days full of good news make us both happy.  Hickman catheter  is in and seems like she is not in much pain . But today when they took her away from me  after she got sedated, I started to cry. I dont know why . I cryed and cryed and cryed and then stopped . I guess 20 minutes was enough :D |Everything they do to her just scares me. ALl the tests, all the scans all the doctors. Yeah, all of them are nice but I'm still scared not knowing how will she react when real party starts :(

      Pray for her. She is 5 year old chemo patient. Today her parents and granparents got really bad news.  Her journey started 2 years ago with tumor in her kidney, now it's in multiple places in her brain. Doctors told her family that zoe has less than 10% survival chance. :(  2 weeks ago she was full of energy. Now She hardly ever opens her eyes and  almost does not eat.  She is all skin and bones :(  Her family keeps praying and hoping for the best .They say it's all now in HIS hands....

      8 Treatments finised. Now we have long weekend ahead of us. LONG and slow and boring because everybody is leaving Ronald McDonald house. I feel like we'll be the only family staying there for this 3 day weekend :( It sucks to live so far from CA.  ** During the next week Dr Gajjar is out of office.  I got Reginas next week scedule. Next week sucks. ALl her apointments are NOON  ones. I'm 100% sure its because Dr Gajjar is out of office and not pushing radiation guys to take Regina in Early. I can  handle this one week. I just feel sad for regina because some days she'll get her first meal around 4-5 pm. Which is really bad  because she is  allready loosing weight and I don't want her to loose more.   She is doing reat  .  Bad thing is Her taste has changed ( foods) and her apetite is down.

      Today was the shortest day ever. Her  apointment was 8.15  and guess what, WE did not have to wait for 3 hours :) we were pretty  much on time- just 30 minute wait time. And  we were out from that hospital 9.15 :) Tomorrow we have little longer day.  Starting from Tuesday  next week she'll het 6 extra hours added to her scedule. Dr Gajjar just made us another informed consent  statement-  study called FAST ForWord program. This is  a part of the research study to find out if a computer based training system can prevent some  or all fo the decresed in school performance that sometimes occurs in children treated for brain cancer.  Half of the patients will receice the computer bvsed program, and the oter half will receive regular help with their schoolwork. and seems like we are the oter half( but it could change, it all depends ... The sudy  is  for PNET I know it'll be very frustrating  for regina since she does not like orders given to her. She has her own mind and it's very hard for me or the others explane it to her that she has to listen to us :(

      UGH. Regina had 8.15 radiation session- she SUPPOSED to have it 8.15- but  the mashine broke down just before she supposed to start her treatment. SO the guy  comes out  to the waiting area , sees us, and I knew immediatily something was wrong. We waited until 10.30 - it got fixed by then. And finally they invited us in and said the problem is fixed.  Table was in wrong position and hight and it screwed up the whole system.  I was worried sick- what if they dont fix the problem, what is going to happen, where  are they going to send us....  but luckily they found the problem and fixed it. :) 9 more weeks of head and spine radiation and then for 4 weeks  Head only radiation :(

      She is Reginas Fast ForWord teacher. She told me that she'll leave in 2 weeks. :( TO bad. I really like . She is nice and patient  and  Regina seems to like her.  I'm worried that It'll take more time for Regina to get used to New one.  And her style might be different  and .... Ok, time will show. :)  We have saturday 8.30 Radiation apointment.

      Reginas Hair started falling out  2 days ago.  I really thought That it would not bother me at all but it does.  Today when I pulled some of it gently away, she took it back from me and tucked it under her scarf.  She almost started crying- I was not that strong. I did start crying.  She loves her hair and she always did and now it's taken away from her. Her hair is her security blanket. She  wants to have long has as sleeping beauty does.   But there is really nothing we can do. Se does not want to have wig and she refuses to believe that ALL of her hair will fall out.  I feel so sad and helpless.... I know it's only hair, but for her her hair means a world. :)

Today she got some Diva toy with lots of clothes.   Her blood counts were ok. Not the best but! Ok ! Now she is geting her 9th radiation treatment and after that another MRI and we are  ready to leave this place for today. Her first meal will be today around 5 pm :(  Poor kid.   During the weekend I tryed to feed her as often as possible and because of that she gained 300 grams!!!! I'm really happy about that. I know she'll loose some during this week.  +

      REgina is off the sedation list- which means she can eat her breakfast. SHe does not have to wait until noon  or afternoon before her first meal. She had her first Radiatin session without sedation on Monday. IT was 30 minutes long because they had new markings and they had to make new patch for her eye. SHE DID IT! She laied still for 30 minutes. I'm so proud of her! SHe is my hero :) Righ now  she in camp for 30 minutes- instead of 2 hours. Because she has radiation around  10 am.

      July, 30th, 2004 Today was such a great day. It started 11.00 AM. St Jude hosted first Talent show ever. :) Regina, Claire, and brook sang a song and danced. I forgot what   is the name of it but it went someting like this - thumbs up, elbows back, feet apart, knees together , bottoms up etc. They learned it during the summer camp and they all did great. Their  little performance was a hit.  Everybody loved it. Regina was wearing her Belle dress and shoes and was cute as ever. She got so many comments  how pretty and beautiful and cute she looks.  I'm so proud of her.  At first she told me she does not want to do it, but finally when we went to back to hospital she said she was ready to sing and dance is front of the audience. AND she did not get stage fright! You go girl!!1 :)  After that she had her Radiation treatment- she  did really well. Did not move at all. Then we went to Costco , bought some water.  Then I found Kohls- my favoite store in the Whole wide world. I needed a suitcase and since kohls  always has sails I got one bright red suitcase  on sale 60% off- I payed 78 dollars. It is huge red suitcase :)  After that we went to see The Cinderella story- she loved it. It was to " CHEEZZZZZY  " for me. Boy  meets a girl, girl meets a boy, blah, blah , blah. Classic Disney.  But oh well, all the things we do to make our kids happy.  And I want to make her happy, but the same time I'm really , really tired doing everything she wants. I want to do something I WANT!   She even gets frustraited when I talk to somebody Little WAY to long- 10 minutes. She let's me know by interrupting me and telling me that MOM, YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME!! WTF??????  I've been told by 4 year old what to do, what to wear and with whoom to talk to. Only thing she does not tell me is WHAT  should I eat. But she did mention that I got bigger. Yeah, you heard it right. SHe  monitors my weight. Righ now she is in bed and watching video. I just changed her dressing(central IV line dressing, if you wonder) . She wanted to play here instead, but I told her that It is my time now. Chill out babe!!!

I can not belive how fast time went by. I thought it'll never end but it did. Now we have to get ourselves ready for&nbsp; high dose chemo. I'm not looking forward for that. :(

      While in Memphis I started drinking coffee to keep me awake when needed.   I had some  health problems in  past and my doc was strongly  against me usinc caffein( sp?).  Sorry doc, I had to. But now I have been caf. free for 3 days and headaces I got  are horrible. I had to stop drinking  because instead of making me awake and aleart , coffee made me sleepy and crupmpy and irritable. I really liked the taste of coffee, but I  had to stop because of  my organism did not tolerate coffein. :( By, by.  Now , I  have to find a way to get on track with my eating. Food just tastes too good. Nuts,  trail mixes, chips- JUNK tastes good. I still eat my healty food, but I overeat and I snack a lot. :( My jeans are allready to tight and I   hate it. :( . I started exersising again- not as much as before but I do my 30 minutes of cardio every day.  But better that than nothing.  Regina keeps doing great. She really wants to go to back to school, but with all those germs  I would not risk , not even for a day. I dont want her to have fever or cold or whatever illness because if she gets something we have to go to back to hospital. :( WE dont want that.  Gabriel is sweetheart. He has cutest smiles and he gives best kisses and hugs in the whole world. I'm so sorry sweety that I have to go away from you again.  :(  My husband is also doing great. He is great help around the house and I'm really proud of him. He is a great parent.  My sister misses parting and friends in back home. Her b-day is in August 13th. I'm planning taking her to restaurant and   night club after that. We'll see. FRIDAY and 13th. No good can come out ot it... lets just wait and seeeee.

      We.ve been  home since Thursday. It is really nice to be home. Regina allready had her FIRST EVER sleepower with her best friend Heather. Heathers mom said  that they  played really nice the whole night and when it was time to sleep   they continued their conversation until  11-12 PM.  In the morning, after I went there to pick her up, she did not want to leave. SHe started crying in the car and told me that she wanted to be with  heather all the time. . :( Sorry, sweety. And H. Is such a nice girl . I'm really happy that Regina has her as her best friend. B. Is doing really great job taking care of H. :)  My batter with food is never ending. I  CAN not stop eating- snacking. I thought it'll get better after I get home, but no, I  still want to eat 24/7 and If I'm not eating, I'm thinking about my next meal- how bad is this?? I want help, but I'm not sure what kind of help should I get. ???  We went to see movie The Village. I loved it. Really good and full of suspense. :) Go see it if you havent yet.
