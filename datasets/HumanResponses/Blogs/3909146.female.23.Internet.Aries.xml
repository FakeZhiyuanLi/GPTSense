        Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed  away; behold, all things have become new. 2 Corinthians 5:17  Is there an opportunity that you have been working on does not seem to be working out? Keep the following in mind:  When the idea is not right -- God says, No!  When the time is not right -- God says, Slow!  When you are not right -- God says, Grow!  The self-centered person has to grow in unselfishness before God says, GO!  The cautious person must grow in courage before God will say, GO!  The reckless person must grow in carefulness before God will say, GO!  The timid person must grow in confidence before God will say, GO!  The self-belittling person must grow in self-love before God will say, GO!  The dominating person must grow in sensitivity before God will say, GO!  The critical person must grow in tolerance before God will say, GO!  The negative person must grow in positive attitude before God will say, GO!  The power-hungry person must grow in kindness and gentleness before God will say, GO!  The pleasure-seeking person must grow in compassion for suffering people before  God will say, GO!  When everything is right -- God says, GO!    Â© 2002 Robert H. Schuller, Hour of Power    urlLink

       God Has a Plan for You Hebrews 10:35-36  God does not react; He plans. He planned creation. He planned the raising up of  a nation from whom He would send the Messiah. He planned the coming of Jesus and His death on the cross. He planned our redemption even before He created the world. (Revelation 13:8). And He planned a place for us in heaven.  It's easy to understand that God has a plan for our lives because that is in keeping with His nature. He didn't create us, drop us into the world, and say, "Do  the best you can." He has a special plan for each of us - He relates to us  as individuals and endows us with unique spiritual gifts and callings. Paul knew that God had called him specifically to be an apostle (1 Corinthians 1:1).   What did God have in mind when He created you? What were His plans for your vocation, how you would serve Him, and whether you are to marry?  You can be assured that God has a plan for every moment of your life. Through His Word and the Spirit, He is saying,  "I am reliably here to meet your needs. I created you. I saved you. I have a purpose and design for your life. I am here to support you and to enable you to accomplish all I have in mind for your life. And I will never leave you."  The only life that can bring God honor is the life surrendered to Him and His purpose. Cooperate with His plan for you, which is the way to find joy, peace, and deep satisfaction.
