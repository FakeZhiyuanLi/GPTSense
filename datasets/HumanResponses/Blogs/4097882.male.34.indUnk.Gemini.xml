      I'm really going to have to get better at coming up with titles for entries. I just got the urge to sit down and write some more, and then I find myself spending 10 minutes trying to come up with a "witty" title for the post. Sorry. I'm going to just roll with this and see if a better title presents itself.  So I set up a fantasy football league today. I'm a very big football fan, NFL and college. Browns and Buckeyes. It's fairly consuming for me during the season. About six years ago I discovered the fun and simplicity of online fantasy football and I've been hooked since. I've pretty much played with three teams every year, usually one in a gambling league, one in a private league for fun with friends, and one in a general public league. I haven't won a Super Bowl yet, but I've had a team in every year. Two years ago I was a small fraction of a point from $250.00. Last year I ran the money league (I usually do) with a bunch of my co-workers and one of the cocksuckers that worked for me stole the money out of my desk. About $300.00. We all knew who it was but I couldn't prove it. I fired him for a lesser charge a couple weeks later. The worst part about it was he was stealing money from guys that were on his team, that reported to him. And were poor, too. Total asshole.  This year I don't think I'm going to play in a money league. I feel kind of disillusioned after last year. There were some other major issues between people in the league that just couldn't be good sports, so I was pretty miserable most of the year. Fuck that. This year I'll probably play two, maybe three leagues. Last year my wife played for the first time and loved it. She was not a sports fan at all when we first got together, but grew into a pretty hardcore Browns and Buckeyes fan after living with me in Cleveland for a few years. It was pretty cool playing together in the same league, so I invited her into the free league I set up today. I also invited my brother. I've got one friend that I work with and I know he's going to join. I'd like to end up with eight teams total, so we'll have to recruit four more people or else just let Yahoo assign a couple more randomly.  I woke up pissed off today. It wasn't really terribly surprising, as I went to bed pissed off. Pissed at my dumb ass wife. I love her to death and couldn't live without her, but god damn she can piss me off. I tend to let myself get really worked up over stupid shit like that and then carry it with me for a long time. Granted, she kept digging herself in deeper this morning. She just has almost no "sixth sense" of when to back the fuck off of me. So, I've been pissed off all day. I went out this morning to take care of some errands and left her home, which is unusual for us on the weekends. She wanted to go get some new pants and I didn't want anything to do with that trip. It was a very nice, quiet morning away from the fucking dogs and the wife, yet I managed to stay good and pissed the whole time. Then when I came home she was out, leaving me with the dogs (the puppy needs absolutely constant supervision right now, so there's not much of a choice to ignore her). I had them penned in the kitchen while I was back here in the studio putzing around. Then the pool guy shows up and sends both dogs, especially the puppy, into a never ending fit of barking. Loud, mean barking. Finally she came home and took them off my hands. I ended up shutting the door to the studio, putting on headphones, and playing the synth just to drown out the fucking noise. That barking just takes me instantaneously into the red zone.  Then she's her typical Satuday dumb ass self for most of the afternoon so I kept to myself and fired up this new blog on the laptop while watching old NFL films on the NFL network.. She got done with whatever innane project she was working on and came in to annoy me, so I rescinded the laptop and have retired to the studio. Much more comfortable anyway. Great music - SRV live Little Wing bootleg right now (God I love MP3's), dim lights, incense, mood enhancements, and I'm in good shape. It's my own little paradise in here. Nice and dark and cool.  Dinner is starting to smell damn good. I'm not really sure what she's up to. Some kind of paste for pork chops that she made with some of the fresh herbs from our garden - rosemary, thyme, sage - plus garlic and some other stuff I think. I had my babble filter turned on when she was telling me so I don't rightfully recall. Then I think she's grilling the chops. I walked past the kitchen a little big ago and she had a big pile of sliced onions on the board, so maybe there's something else good brewing out there too. I'm starving. The munchies, you know.  I should go take an interest in dinner to make sure things are moving in the right direction. Maybe I'll fire up a little Xbox football until she's ready to eat.  A.

      So, the first real post begins. For some strange reason, I've had the urge to write lately. Strange because in 34 years I can't remember having had that urge before, at least not quite in the same way. Also strange because I've never written anything in my life.  I've also felt really confused lately, but I'm not really sure about what. I just have this underlying feeling like there's something going on in my life that's not in my control and that I don't understand. It's weird, It's kind of like the unconscious mind desparately trying to break through into the conscious. It's like when something is on the tip of your tongue - it's so intense that you can feel it, and you can almost even see it in your mind, but yet it's vague enough that you have no idea what it is. But above all else, it's a nagging feeling, drawing so much of your thought that it almost comes to distratction. It's fucked up.  So it nags, and nags, and nags to the point that it starts to make you generally pissy. That's about where I am right now. The frustration of not being able to identify the source of the feeling keeps me at such a high level of anxiety all the time as to be very short tempered. Couple that with a six month old puppy that has a tendency to bark for no real reason, and typically refuses to cooperate when asked to stop and you can probably guess that I'm on the brink of losing it.  There's a part of me that feels like maybe if I start writing this stuff down then perhaps I will start to understand it better. It's something that I'm not really comfortable talking about with my wife because, frankly, she's a part of the general anxiety. My wife happens to be about the greatest wife ever, so there's no real reason that she should be a part of the anxiety. But she also gets subjected to the short temper problem, just like the puppy. I guess in any relationship that there is a certain level of irritation that comes just from the extreme amount of time spent together. Sometimes she deserves it, sometimes she doesn't. Whatever.  Arthur Dent is a character from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of novels. If you've read them then you may be able to appreciate why I chose that name for my anonymous blog. It's because most days I feel a lot like Arthur - like I just woke up and found out that the universe was not what I expected. More like all of a sudden everything is not what it was yesterday.  I've decided to keep this blog terra incognito, at least for the time being, to my friends, family, etc. Even my wife, with whom I share most everything. I'm discovering the feeling of freedom that comes with complete anonymity. I like it because for the first time I feel like I'm able to completely expose my feelings without risk of being found out. Not that I'm a "fake" person by any means, in fact I like to think quite the opposite. It's more that for many years I have kept my deepest feelings deep. I'm very uncomfortable opening myself up to others, which kind of sucks when you're a musician. It's always held me back.  Now that I'm about two days from falling off my rocker, I figure let's go for broke and start a blog where I can write whatever I want about anything that I want and not have to worry about messing anything up in my fairly complicated life. I've never kept a journal at all. I tried and failed on a couple of occasions throughout the years. Maybe I can make it stick this time. I'm hoping for some interaction to make this a living, evolving dialog.  I hoping this doesn't end up just to be about me and my issues. Time will tell. . . .  She is preparing dinner right now. It's been a fairly challenging weekend for me aleady, so I'm enjoying a few quiet minutes away from her and the damn dogs. Not that quiet - I've got Sigur Ros playing now. I just discovered these guys in the last two weeks or so and they are the shiz-nit. A very cool Icelandic band. Their style woudl be tought to describe, so just go check out a couple of their sample songs posted on their web site at www.sigurros.com. Perhaps contemplative is a better adjective than quiet.

       Welcome to my maiden voyage on to the Internet. I've recently been caught up in several different individuals' blogs and find them fascinating.  I decided that perhaps it would be fun to start my own blog for several different reasons to be shared in a later post. I've just designed the basic blog setup and wanted to put an initial post in here.  So, if you're reading - welcome! You could very well be the first visitor EVER to MY NEW BLOG! Feel free to comment with whatever crosses your mind - that's what I intend to do.  Stay tuned for more later . . .  A.

      Quick input - would it be too gross for me to post a picture of my wife's clitoral piercing here? Natually it would be anonymous, showing only the relevant area. I don't think it's gross, I happen to find it quite attractive, but I'm a mild pervert.  I'm not talking about a shot that's super sexual in nature, just a decent digital photo of the area. I know that some of my loyal visitors are women, and since this isn't a porn blog by nature I don't want to run everybody off. I know I said that this blog would be completely on my own terms, but in this case I'll defer to popular opinion.  BTW - I started reading  The Prophet  by Khalil Gibran again yesterday. One of my posts in the last week or so got me thinking about it so I pulled it out for the first time in a couple of years. Damn it's good stuff. His writing reminds me of an Eric Clapton guitar solo - so much is said with so few words.  It's a short book and well worth the read. Go buy it now. You'll be a happier person.  A.

      Here I sit again, in the midst of prime sleeping hours and not sleeping. I've been up for about 30 minutes and it doesn't look like I'll be going back to bed. That makes the afternoon at work VERY challenging. I guess that's why God, or Juan Valdez, made coffee, right?  So this shaped up to be an OK weekend. Not spectacular but not too bad either. I didn't really get pissed at my wife too many times, so I guess it was a success in that respect. And I didn't spend as much time reading or writing as I had hoped. That's kind of strange, as I didn't really do terribly much over the weekend, but I didn't. I guess I've spent a lot of "alone" time over the last two weeks and now I'm enjoying spending time with my wife and dogs again.  It's tough for me to write for the blog when the old lady is around, though I certainly have before. Typically I'm back in the inner sanctum of my studio, writing in peace, though I've been known to sit on the couch in front of the TV and bang out some of the less inspired material, like the cut-and-paste John Kerry stuff. And sorry for the political statements, it's just that there's so much attention being paid to GWB's past that I figured it's only fair if we shed a little light on JackAss Kerry's hypocrisy, too. Face it folks, all politicians are hypocrites - it's part of the job description.  I did spend a good amount of time in the studio this weekend, though. I still haven't gotten insipred to actually sit down and write anything, which is good because I'm only set up for live sound right now - the board isn't run back into the computer for recording yet. I did have a lot of fun just playing and learning some new tunes and experimenting with some synth programming ideas and whatnot. I tried to plug my guitar in for the first time in months and realized that I've consumed every cord that I owned in the studio re-design last month. Oh well, that's just a good excuse to go shopping! Of course a shopping trip wouldn't be a shopping trip if all I looked at was the crappy cables that I need. If any of you are independently wealthy and are wondering what to get me for the next holiday that you buy gifts for, buy me  urlLink this . I showed it to my wife at the store and she's prety much on board with me buying it, as she always is, I just can't justify dropping the cash on it right now. It's either that or  urlLink this . The cheap one is surely sufficient, but as long as I'm dreaming I might as well shoot for the moon.  My clients owe me a bunch of money that should be coming very soon. When that happens I'll be many thousands of dollars richer, so maybe I'll buy it then. I just have to decide if it's worth the money to me - will I actually get some use out of it or will it just be a new toy that I'll be tired of in two weeks? I really need to get my guitar to a decent tech for a "once over" as well, though I can't seem to find one in this guy forsaken town. Anybody know of a good guitar tech in Dallas, preferrably northern suburbs?  So that was a part of my weekend - playing around in the studio and shopping at Guitar Center and online. By the way - great deals on cables with lifetime unconditional warranty at www.sweetwater.com, and a good price on adapters, too. If any of you are musical types, then you should definitely check them out. I've always heard great things about their pro quality audio gear and digital recording stuff but I've never shopped there before. I was pleased. Free shipping, too.  The rest of the weekend I completed a few small chores around the house, the usual handyman type stuff, watched a lot of football, and took my wife to the tattoo parlor. Yes, she announced Friday night that she was finally ready for the belly button piercing that she's been talking about for months. It's literally been a major driving force behind her losing all of the weight and getting in to shape as much as she has. Far be it from me to interfere with my wife's quest to become sexier, so I took her down to one of the local tattoo and piercing establishments and got it done today. Pretty simple procedure, acutally. Nice for me because the chick who did it was SMOKING, at least to me. She was painfully skinny with these super low rise jeans that barely stayed up. Of course she was tattoo'ed all to hell and had no bra, showing off the piercings in her tiny, but very perky, little boobies. Admittedly she did look like she could potentially have a combo problem of HIV/heroin addiction, but she was pretty sexy none the less. She was clean, at least, which really made it more of an anorexia thing than a heroin thing.  This was a pretty fast and easy one. My only real standard of comparison was when she had her clit (actually her hood) done a few months ago at a different shop. That was a longer experience from start to finish, but over all better for both of us I think. The shop was probably equivalent, though we both liked the girl who did the clit better. Naturally it's very hot for me to see my wife laying with her legs spread eagle while another hot chick roots around in her holiest of holies. Nice. I think she said that one hurt more at the moment but less afterward. It healed amazingly well and quickly, too. The new one isn't looking bad, but it certainly isn't looking as good as the clit piercing did either. I'll spare you the gorey details.  I've never had a body piercing. At one point in my hey day as a deadhead and working musician I had four in my ears only, which was pretty crazy for 1990, but none anywhere else. And I pierced them all myself, so I never had the whole tattoo parlor experience until recently. The first one I pierced when I was completely out of my head on LSD and deathly ill with bronchitis - naturally it was majorly fucked up, and ultimately the skin healed over the outside of the earring. Ouch. I let it heal and re-pierced it when I was slightly less high and it worked out well. They've all been closed up for about 10 years now. Time flies. Makes me long for the good old days before I was a corporate whore. The scars are still there to remind me just exactly how much of a whore I am every day.  Well I suppose that's enough for now. I didn't even mention the book I read -  urlLink   The Tao of Pooh  .  It's been out forever, so you've probably read it already. I originally read it a couple times back in the late 80's or early 90's and just recently bought it for my wife. I wouldn't call if overly inspirational by a long shot, but it's definitely worth the short time it takes to read. It helps keep things in perspective. If you're like me and read it 15 years ago when it was all the rage and liked it, then re-read it again now. I picked a copy up off the Amazon marketplace brand new for $5.00. Enjoy.  A.

      Ponder this one. Again, I haven't verified the verity of the facts.  ===========================  An interesting side-light on the election campaign.  Subject: Heinz 57  Look at the label of a jar of Heinz sandwich slice pickles. Yep...."Made in Mexico" Check out some of your Heinz products.  Sen. John Kerry keeps talking about U.S. corporations leaving this country and setting up shop in foreign countries, taking thousands of jobs with them. He is right, because that has happened. However, he is trying to blame it on George W. Bush.  As far as I know, Bush has not moved one factory out of this country because he is not the owner of a single factory.  That cannot be said about Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz-Kerry. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Kerrys own 32 factories in Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific. In addition, their company, the Heinz Company,leases four factories in Europe and four in Asia. Also, they own 27 factories in North America, some of which are in Mexico and the Caribbean. I wonder how many hundreds of American workers lost their jobs when these plants relocated to foreign countries. I also wonder if the workers in Mexico and Asia are paid the same wages and benefits as workers in the United States.  Of course they're not. However, Kerry demands that other companies that relocate should pay the same benefits they did in the U.S. Why does he not demand this of the Heinz Company, since he is married to the owner? If Kerry is elected, will he and his wife close all those foreign factories and bring all those jobs back to America? Of course they won't.  They're making millions off that cheap labor.  ====================  Take that for what it's worth.  A.

      So it's Saturday morning and I'm finally sitting down to write a real post. Although the last several days have been busy nothing much happened worth writing about. I could certainly give you the play by play of some interesting things at work, but considering that I barely survived the torture without a stroke the first time I don't know if I could survive reliving the events. Oh, one noteworthy thing did occur, but it was to be expected.  This is how The Good Wife did me when I didn't post for a couple of days.    I definitely deserved it. Thanks for keeping me in line GW. Love hurts.  So I've been watching Hurricane Charley pretty closely, as I've been terribly worried about my brother and sister. My sister has a four week old baby, their first, in a relatively new home in Kissimmee. As far as I can tell, the eye of the storm pretty much rolled directly over her house last night. I've been quickly catching up on the damage reports and whatnot today, and I suspect everything is OK as long as they stayed home. The real damage was over on the west coast, in the Port Charlotte area, where the storm came ashore. Even now there are deputies standing guard over piles of bodies in a couple trailer parks that ambulances can't get to yet. Yeah, I know, what do you expect if you live in a trailer a mile from the ocean? I don't feel sorry for them, but I do feel sorry for the owners of over 200 homes that were completely leveled. I feel sorry for the people who are piling on top of each other in shelters right now wondering if their homes are still standing. God that has to suck bad.  My brother owns several homes over in the Melborune area, including a condo on the beach. I'm sure the condo was fine because it was pretty much built to be hurricane proof, and his unit is on the sixth floor so even high seas and flooding couldn't touch it. It's a solid concrete building and he's got steel hurricane shutters that are real cool. When you flip a switch they automatically roll over all of the windows and the entire balcony, protecting the glass and anything you have sitting outside. The newest home that he actually lives in is north of Melbourne in the Satellite Beach area, I think (I haven't been there yet). Looking at the maps he missed the eye but certainly must have had several hours of sustained winds at 90 mph or better, massive flooding and power outages, broken trees, etc. He sent me this email late yesterday afternoon:  "My house may not be here in 16 hours, they have put into place an "Optional" evacuation (probably to become Mandatory in a few hours), I have next to nothing in non-perishable food, zero batteries, no bottled water,....and all I can really think about is the tribe starting a three game series with Twins at the Jake!!!   I have made sure I have enough booze to last a few days, and if things get much more serious, I am prepared to seal my collection of porn in waterproof plastic!!!!!!!!!   I am prepared to strap myself to a large palm tree in my front yard (Much the way Lt. Dan did in Forrest Gump), so if you do not hear from me again, please, only remember the nice things about me....and make sure my funeral is not scheduled during a game in this glorious streak!  (Besides, I don't think mom would appreciate T-Mo bringing a walkman and providing updates during the ceremony!)"  There you have it. I hope the porn survived. Oh yeah, and his beautiful girlfriend and two beautiful dogs.  I sent them both an email to check in late last night, but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that the cable system is down. Shit, they didn't even have radio in Orlando for a while last night. I'll probably call later today, if there's even phone service.  I guess I better stop for now. I've already got my next couple of posts drafted in my mind, so they'll be coming soon. I could go on, but the hot tub is ready to go, my wife is waiting for me to join her, and I'm looking forward to a good day (hopefully). That's interesting because the post I was going to write this morning, and probably will write later, is an analysis of how thing have changed for me since I've started blogging. Basically, how things I used to spend time doing (talking to my wife) have been replaced by cyber rambling and blog whoring.  Keeping with weekend tradition, though, I'll probably be back here in two hours writing some dark post about how much my wife pisses me off. Please, pray for me. I don't want to hate my wife today. Plus, she gave me one good fucking last night and I'd like to get me a little more of that kind of sugar.  A.  P.S. For those interested, there is a brand spanking new episode of ATHF tomorrow night. They've got three or four others done that will be airing over the next couple of months. Check the ATHF link in my sidebar for more details. And tomorrow's episode should the good - Ignignot and Erg are back!  P.P.S. I'm seriously going to change my shitty counter sometime when I have nothing better to do then stare quizically at HTML code. I hate my  shitty counter. I was duped by Sitemeter. And you are probably starting to hate my "P.S."'s. Is that how you write the plural form of P.S.? Anybody? Buehler?

      I've just returned to the world of the living for a minute. I've had a lot going on the last couple of days and I'm hoping to check in a bit more this weekend. It's actually been a decent couple of days, but the blog has suffered. I wanted to put up a quick post but I'm do lazy to log in and do it, so I'm doing the email thingy. I hope it works.  This tends to be a busy time of year for me. I just haven't made time to write a post. That coupled with a slightly busier than usual work schedule, the first week of preseason football, an extremely skewed sleep schedule, and the first book that I've picked up in several years have distracted me from posting.  The book was good, though. I'll write some about it this weekend. I've already started reading it again. Definitely OCD.  A.  P.S. GW - I've been lurking. I haven't made time to read but I've definitley kept up with the Wiggles report. I just flipped over and realized I'm behind a couple of posts. That's all right, I'll probably wake up at 4:00 AM tomorrow as usual. I'll catch up then.  P.P.S. I've got family in Orlando and Melbourne, FL and I'm very worried about them. Sister with a new baby in Orlando and a brother in Melbourne. My brother is the type that would sit on his patio with a martini as the storm rolls through, but I'm much more concerned about my sister's family. That's why I had the PC logged on - watching the radar. At least it should be over quickly.

      I think I hate my hit counter. I've been using Sitemeter. At first I thought it was pretty cool, but today it seems to be not be working and the stats page is kind of lame.  Can anybody recommend a good, FREE stat tracker for a blog? I've always been fascinated when someone can tell you that their page came up on a google search for "hairy skunk urine" or something like that - can I get that incorporated into the counter/stat tracker?  Thanks in advance if anybody knows of any. If so, let me know how I can return the favor.  A.

      Here's the story on my dogs, referenced in many posts prior to this. Sorry, dial up users, the pictures are inevitable. It drives me crazy when people start busting out pictures of their kids and I have to pretend like I give a damn, but I'm just as bad when it comes to my dogs. Deal.  Our dogs are the center of our life, without a doubt. We're not the child bearing types, so our dogs get all of our affection. Both of them are "pound puppies", mixed breeds that we picked up here and there. The oldest one is about 4 1/2 years old. Her mother, Scruffy, was a Springer Spaniel mix. Mixed with what no one knows, but I would suspect at least some Border Collie based upon her appearance and some of our dog's traits. The father is unidentified, though a black lab had been seen hanging around Scruffy's yard around the time she got knocked up. You do the math. That makes our dog a lab-springer spaniel-god knows what mix. I was driving home from work one day when we lived in Ohio and I saw the classic "Free Puppies" sign scrawled in spray paint on a piece of cardboard and stuck in front of someone's mailbox a few blocks from our house. Neither my wife nor I had ever owned a dog before, but we had been wanting to get one for months. We wanted a pure bred dog (pointer/setter) for bird hunting, but we were a little scared to spend that much money on a dog when we had never had one before. I saw the sign and thought that perhaps we should get a free puppy, see how it worked out for a year or two, and then get the pure bred as a second dog if things worked out. I sent my hesitant wife over to look at the puppies, and it was over when she saw the box full of four week old puppies.  I was going to save this picture until the end, but now seems very appropo. Here she is the day after we got her, six and a half weeks old.     Now, the puppy, our darling Ivy. We actually found her on the Internet. We've had her for about three months now and I love her more every day. We had been wanting a second dog for years, and we finally decided the timing was right. I was changing jobs so we didn't anticipate any travel, perfect time to raise a puppy. Then we agonized over whether we should go the pure bred route, adopt a pound puppy, or keep an eye out for an adult rescue dog. The hunting dog was clearly out, as we don't have much of a yard any more and live in super yuppy land with no chance of hunting any time in the foreseeable future. The one thing we did know was that we wanted a big dog. We were leaning towards a Golden Retriever but hadn't fully decided. My wife started casually looking around, watching the web sites from all of the local shelters and rescues, etc. One day after a couple weeks of the half-hearted search the local Great Pyrenees rescue posted puppy pictures for a litter of five mixed breed puppies, half pyrenees and half Border Collie. It took the two of us about a nanosecond to decide that these were the puppies for us. The one we found that we fell in love with first was a little girl named Renee. After several weeks and much emailing, a home visit and personal interview, reference checks with friends and our vet, and a contract, we adopted little Renee and renamed her Ivy Renee. Actually, since we figured she was certainly pretty enough to deserve a fancy name like the show dogs, she is officially named Ivy Renee Buttercup Stinky Jr. but goes by the name of Ivy (sometimes Stinky).  Here she is the day after we got her.      She might be the prettiest dog ever. And if you can believe it, she's actually sweeter than she looks. Our older dog is very sweet, and was a very cute puppy, but this one is so unreal. It's exactly the dog my wife wanted - big, cuddly, and very soft. She's up to about 42 pounds now and she stands several inches taller than the other dog. Ivy never wants anything more than to lay in your lap, give kisses, and get her belly rubbed. It's a bit akward now that she's getting bigger, but cute nonetheless.  There's a more recent picture down below on an earlier post, here's another, slightly sillier one from the same night.    The older dog, Chani, is up to about 65 pounds. She's much more active than Ivy, always has been. She grew up in a much smaller house with a MUCH bigger yard. We used to be real "outdoorsy" too, so she spent a lot of her puppy time camping, fishing, chasing geese and squirrels, and the like. She lives for her tennis ball and loves to swim in the pool any chance she gets. She's the one who sent us to the doggy ER Sunday night. First is one of my favorite puppy pictures of her at about 3 months old, the rest were taken about a two or three months ago.          And of course I wouldn't leave you hanging without posting a couple pictures of them  together. Very recent.      So there you have it, the loves of my life. Much like the wife, they can drive me to the brink of insanity one minute, then come cuddle up at my feet and make me melt five minutes later. Completely crazy, but completely darling.  A.

      Driving in to work today I spoke with my mother for the first time in a couple of weeks and she had some shocking news to share. Apparently there's a been a significant breakthrough in the Cold War between her and my grandmother, with whom I have not spoken in four or more years.  I'm shocked, and frankly, disappointed as it's easier to ignore her than it is to deal with her (grandma). I'll write more later, but I just got to the office and figured this would give me a good excuse to test this whole email posting thingy.   (Apologies in advance if the email post doesn't come through in the right format).  A.

      Still no dog pictures posted. I am one lazy mo fo. The outlet mall trip was very uneventful yesterday afternoon. Two noteworthy things happened last night, though. First, Joe Gibbs won his first game upon returning to the NFL, and a good game it was. Second, I got laid.  The Hall of Fame Game was unusually good last night. Perhaps it was karma making up for the early cancellation due to storms last year. Yes, of course, it had the usual string of never ending penalties and crappy errors by third string players, but that's a given in any preseason game, especially the first of the year. But this one actually came down to the final second of the game when the second string kicker for Washington banged in a moderately long field goal to win the game. Good stuff.  All in all, Washington looked solid, I thought. I have to say that I didn't watch as closely as I typically do BECAUSE OF THESE FUCKING BLOGS. That and the fact that I have a laptop with a wireless Internet connection. I literally couldn't pull myself away to watch the game. I definitely need to get more disciplined in that respect or something is going to have to give. In the parts I watched, I felt like Denver was worse than last year and Washington was much better. I'm not a fan of either, but I am becoming a Denver/Shanahan hater. I already like Joe Gibbs and I can feel myself becoming a 'Skins fan, at least peripherally. No team will ever replace my beloved Brownies, but I always like to have a couple secondary teams that I take an interest in. Lately it's been the Vikings and the Bucs, but I'm not feelin' it for the Bucs anymore. This could be a big year for the Vikings, so that one's a keeper.  So, now to the sex part. Thanks for sticking with me this far. I know most Bloggers probably aren't big NFL fans, so I'll try not to rant on that stuff to hard. So I got laid, and exceptionally well if I do so say myself. Exceptionally well for me, at least. Our sex life has got SIGNIFICANTLY better over the last year. I think the biggest precipitating factor is that the d.a.w. has lost over 45 pounds and gotten into pretty damn good physical shape by working out daily for two years and dieting hard since the beginning of this year. She's now very toned, muscularly, looks much better, and is much more confident about her sexuality. She's always been the type of girl that's up for just about anything sexually but at the same time very shy about the whole thing. She's breaking out of her shell a bit, which is cool, but most of all she is just better at it. She even went so far as to get her clit pierced a couple of months ago, which has been a lot of fun for both of us. Not the clit per say, actually the hood. Vertical, for those of you versed in such things. 12 ga. barbell.  I don't understand female sexuality, desire, response, etc. I guess that makes me the only man who doesn't, right? Snicker. I do care, though, but I've given up trying. It's been an open fact between us since we first started sleeping together that she doesn't have orgasms from intercourse. No big deal for either of us, I take care of her in diverse other ways to make sure we all get what we're after. We haven't talked about it in a long time (a couple of years) but when we last did I asked her to "keep me in the loop" with her orgasm situation, in other words, let me know if you start coming. No updates there, but she sure the hell seems to like it a lot more than she used to. She puts on a good show, I'll say that much, though she doesn't blatantly fake having an orgasm. She just puts on a good show of having about as good of a time as I do.  So, I still don't think she's coming, but she's defintely having more fun. She goes at it harder and more agressively than she used to, and she shows some of the other signs that lead me to believe that she's having fun. We typically start out with her on top, by her choice, which is cool with me because I'm lazy. She'll bang me like that for a long time until she tires out, then we'll usually finish up with me nailing her doggy style. Now, I have never claimed to be a skilled lover by any means, but I don't think I'm THAT horrible. My first wife was having multiple orgasms before we split. My cock isn't large, but it certainly isn't small either. According to the people who claim to know, I'm somewhat larger than average but not by much. And she clearly has orgasms by other means, just not from straight up penetration (I don't think).  The fact is, I gave up worrying about it a long time ago. I used to beat myself up over the fact that she doesn't join me in the big O, making me feel like she's just an advanced masturbatory toy for me, but she convinced me years ago to let that one go. She's always claimed to enjoy sex and find it very satisfying, but how can it be satisfying if you don't climax? Hence the conculsion that apparently I am not capable of understanding female sexuality.  So, is she BS-ing me and just doing her wifely duty or is there something there? I tend to judge a person by their actions rather than their words (thanks to Ayn Rand for that one) and she has been wanting it bad lately. Bad by our standards, not by the standards of my dear friend The Good Wife. If my wife had GW's sex drive I would probably not be able to get out of bed to go to work. Though I'd love to find out for sure. . .   Married women, a little help here? Give me some analysis. The underlying theme is, help me understand how a sex life could be satisfying if you can't have a mutual orgasm? Is it possible? Keeping in mind of course that she almost always gets hers, usually before me, via tongue, fingers, vibrators, beads, you name. We like all that stuff.  A.

      Another Monday is upon us. Waaaayyyy too quickly, if I do say so myself. I'm not a big fan of Mondays, especially when I worked all day Saturday. I'll only be working the first half of the day today, then home in the afternoon to get mentally prepared for one of the most significant events of the year - THE FIRST NIGHT OF PRO FOOTBALL! Wooo Hooo!  I'm always tired and slightly sick on Monday mornings, but today is a hair worse than normal. We had a pretty serious scare with my older dog last night and ended up rushing her to the doggy emergency room around 9:30. Earlier in the evening the d. a. wife (see earlier post) dumped some hot food coming out of the oven on to the kitchen floor. Now our dog knows very well that it's her job to clean up anything that falls on the floor, but since dogs don't typically cook their food she not super familiar with the concept of letting it cool down first. That were cubed, roasted potates coated with several different types of spices, most notably some pretty hot ground chilis of some sort. I like my food pretty hot, and we put chilis in just about everything we eat, but these were VERY spicy, even for my taste. Good, but a little too spicy.  So the dog proceeds to snarf down a sizable pile of potatoes that have been out of the oven about 1.5 nanoseconds. She's got a radar for such activities, and the potatoes barely had a chance to hit the tile before they were history. No problem, happy dog, standard practice in our kitchen. About 20 minutes later she vomits the whole mess back up again, completely unchewed (also very normal) along with a big puddle of bile. Not that unusual, not that surprising under the circumstances. Then she vomits again, and again, and again, and again, repeat ad nauseum.  You're getting the idea, I suspect. She vomited about seven or eight times in an hour, and that's very bad news for dog. After the first two rounds there was nothing but bile coming up - bad sign. Vomiting is a fairly normal part of a dog's routine, but not to that extreme. The last time there was some blood in the vomit, and that always constitutes an emergency.  So we frantically call the local emergency vet clinic - we're lucky to have one about a mile down the street. My wife talked at length to the vet and was advised to give her another hour and if she didn't vomit again, don't worry about it. If she did, rush her in. So an hour goes by, no problem, two hours no problem. She resting though she's obviously uncomfortable, so we chalked it off to a lingering belly ache. Three hours goes by and she starts into another fit of vomiting, this time complete with a significant amount of fresh blood, old clots, and more bile.   Now I'm really worried, so I rush my wife out the door with the dog to the doggy ER and I stay home with the puppy. Jumping forward a couple of hours, she's OK. They don't know for sure what the cause was, but they gave her a shot to settle her stomach and a shot to rehydrate her a bit. We have some medicine to give her starting this morning assuming that she's able to keep some water down. So far she seems back to her normal self, but keep your fingers crossed. The bloody vomiting could be a sign of more serious problems like tumors, cancer, or lots of other nasties.  At this point the most likely situation is that the heat and the spiciness of the potatoes set off the violent vomiting. She was vomiting and retching so hard that she probably gave herself an ulceration in her esophagus, which would be the source of the blood. After the last barf she probably laid in pain as her esophagus bled into her stomach, then when the blood clots started to build up in their she had her last vomiting episode.  We let her sleep on the floor of our bedroom last night so we could keep an eye on her in case anything happened. I was so worried about her that I snapped awake every time she yawned or moved around, which was fairly regulary. I don't have any pictures of her hosted yet to share, but I will try to do so later today. She's a very pretty lab and springer spaniel mix. The neighbor kids call her the "cow dog" because she's white with big black spots that resemble a holstein cow, or a gateway computer box for those of you less versed in the farm animal lingo.  So, that's why I'm feeling even worse this Monday than most. That plus the fact that I am preparing to head to the workplace of the damned. At least it's only a half day today. Perhaps more this afternoon, time permitting.  I'm getting ready to head in to hell shortly. Pray for my soul. Maybe I should wear a string of garlic around my neck. That might not go over too well in cubicle land.  A.

      After the last brooding post, here's a little levity as a follow up.  Many thanks for  urlLink Karria  for stopping in. I checked out her blog and it's got some beautiful photos, especially of her original artwork.  Oh yeah, I did a little update to my profile just for fun. I also hooked it up to my msn email so I can start replying to comments by email instead of just on the blog. I also have MSN Messenger, though I haven't used it yet. I'd love someone to "chat me up" so I can figure out how to do it.  I snaked this from Karria's blog because I thought it was pretty funny. Thanks Karria, and whomever originally wrote it. Sorry I'm too lazy to reformat it into a more readable form.  A.  ================= Last year a friend of mine upgraded GirlFriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that it's a memory hog, leaving very little system resources for other applications.  He is only now noticing that Wife 1.0 is also spawning Child-Processes, which are further consuming valuable resources.  No mention of this particular phenomenon was included in the product brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed him that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application.  Not only that, Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is always launched at systeminitialization where it can monitor all other system activity.  He's finding that some applications such as Poker Night 10.3, BeerBash 2.5,and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to run in the system at all,crashing the system when selected (even though they always worked fine before).At installation, Wife 1.0 provides no option as to the  installation of undesired Plug-Ins such as Mother InLaw 55.8 and  Brother InLaw Betarelease.  Also, system performance seems to diminish with each passing day. Some features he'd like to see in the upcoming Wife 2.0: --A "Don't remind me again" button --Minimize button --An install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 to be installed withthe option to uninstall at any time without the loss of cache and other system resources --An option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode, which would allow the systems hroardware probe feature to be much more useful I myself decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with Wife 1.0 by sticking with GirlFriend 2.0.  Even here, however, I found manyproblems. Apparently you cannot install GirlFriend 2.0 on top of GirlFriend 1.0.You must uninstall GirlFriend 1.0 first.  Other users say this is along-standing bug that I should have been aware of.  Apparently the versions of GirlFriend have conflicts over shared use of the I/O port.You think they would have fixed such a stupid bug by now.  To makematters worse, the uninstall program for GirlFriend 1.0 doesn't workvery well, leaving undesirable traces of the application in the system. Another thing that sucks--all versions of GirlFriend continually pop uplittle annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0

      God my wife is a dumb ass. If you've read my previous posts then by now you probably know that I love my wife more than anything ever in life. In fact, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that I love her more than life itself. Considerably more.  However, that doesn't mean that she's not an idiot. As any of you who have ever been in a long term relationship surely know, the more you love somebody the more they are capable of pissing you off. Some shrink or sociologist guy could probably do an interesting study on the ratio between depth of love to depth of the ability to get pissed at somebody. If memory serves, Kahlil Gibran wrote something very poignant to the effect of love fills up the rifts gouged by sadness. It's really cool, and if anybody gives a fuck leave a comment and I'll go upstairs and look up the exact quote. It's in   The Prophet.  In other words, love and sadness are two sides of the same coin - you can only love as deeply as you're willing to expose yourself to emotional pain. Having been through an extremely painful divorce at the young age of 24, I can certainly testify to the verity of that. I don't believe that I even had the ability to love as deeply as I do now prior to the fucking emotional torture that that witch (wife #1) put me through. But I digress. I only mention the Gibran thought because it seems to me that there has to be another poignant corollary to his statement that includes the ability to get pissed off at the person you love. I'll work on it and see what I can come up with.  So, back to the Dumb Ass Wife that I love more than life itself. She will do anything and everything for me all the time, typically before I even ask. The more I yell the harder she tries to please me. Yes, it's fucked up, but our psychoses perfectly compliment each other. Her single greatest flaw (from my standpoint) is that she just isn't terribly reliable. I hesitate to use the word "untrustworthy" because I trust her to the end of the Earth. But, I don't trust that she will ever do what she is supposed to do when she is supposed to do it. Usually it's because she's a dumb ass, sometimes it's because she is forgetful (extremely), and most often it's because she has a tendency to filter a plan through her warped sense of reason and the motivation that comes out is significantly different than the message that was originally sent in. I know that makes absolutely no sense. Too fucking bad, it's the best I can do.  Obviously we've had an "incident" to set me off already today. I've been gone for four days, can't wait to get home, have a decent evening around the house last night, and then of course, first thing in the morning she's got to go and piss me off. Do I over-react? Absolutely. Is this isolated incident worth me being as frustrated as I am? Absolutely not. However, after 10 years of the same fucking shit over and over, one tends to get pretty torqued over minor incidents. I was going to try and describe the play-by-play of the whole situation here, but then you would think I was REALLY crazy. Suffice it to say that to you it would be minor, to me it's outrageous.  I think the real underlying issue is that one of the aspects of my personality disorder is that I hold myself to unattainbly high standards. I always have. Accordingly, I hold everyone else around me to equally unattainable standards. I suppose it makes it very tough to be my wife. Part of the way it works in my head is you always shoot for the moon and when you fuck up you learn and move on. You don't kill yourself when you fall short, but you never stop striving to attain your own standards of perfection. I can't really imagine being any other way, but it seems that the vast majority of the people out there aren't. That's why you'll probably hear me refer to the "cattle" - that's my term for the typical human being that never really uses their rational mind to test or challenge their own goals or motivations, they just tend to follow the herd through life, accept mediocrity as inevitable, and let their brains atrophy like the leg muscles on a quadriplegic. It's sometimes sad if you stop and think about it, but typically I just view them in the same way as I view squirrels, rats, and all the other little critters that run around following their biological urges. And, by the way, everyone I encounter is automatically cattle until they prove otherwise.  My wife is not cattle. She really is very bright and definitely does think more than the average person. She's gotten significantly better in the 9+ years that we've been together, but she still struggles with reason at times. Maybe it's because I'm from Mars and she's from Venus, but I wouldn't know because I don't read that pop psychology shit. I think it's because she's an airhead.   As much as she tries, she still has that nasty piece of herself that will allow her to make an excuse to herself for ignoring reason when it's easier to do so. I have a hard time with that, but everyone will do it to a certain degree. What I really have hard time with is the way she tends to attempt to justify such occurrences to appear to have a rational thought process behind them. When I on occasion do something stupid that would fall in that category, I typically say "yeah, that was really stupid, I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I was being lazy." That statement right there is impossible for my wife to admit. WE ALL DO IT ALL OF THE TIME! It's not the end of the world. But she's become so good at the justifications and rationalizations for her fuck ups that I think she actually believes them, and that precipitates the occasional heated discussion. I won't say argument because we really only raise our voices and truly argue once or twice a year, but we do have these little skirmishes on a fairly regular basis.   It runs in her family, and she's done an incredible job of breaking away from the mold over the last few years. A little history - her dad split when she was around 9 or 10, he ran off with another woman and left her, her mom, and her sister on their own. Life was a major struggle for them for years, and they have this kind of an "us against the world" mentality. They're like the Three Crazy Bitch Musketeers. When I first met her there wasn't drop of reason amongst the three of them, but they've all grown over the years. I think that the rationalization and justifications became standard form around their home growing up to help them not admit how shitty their lives really were. I can't say I blame them, but at the same time it's kind of sad that their own mother had to be like that in order to build some self esteem in her daughters. The end result was that the girls were raised to believe that if things didn't seem quite the way you wanted you could just paint yourself a mental picture of a different life and pretend like it was real. That might make you feel better at the time, but in the long run it's pretty dangerous.  My wife is mostly over it, but every now and then she slips back in. Her mom, well, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Her little sister is better than she has been, but she's really fucked up. She was only about 5 when her dad split, so her entire personality is built upon viewing the world around herself however she would like it to be, regardless of how it really is. The problem with that is that you suffer constantly because things never come out the way you think they should. That's enough of that topic. It's a long, long story that I may explore further at another time. And, by the way, I am absolutely unqualified to make such analytical statements. I'm just passing along my observations and personal opinions about their root causes.  What in the hell happened to this post? I set out to write about how my wife is an unreliable dumb ass and all of a sudden I'm analyzing her sister's fucked up personality. As I read back over it, it seems to be more than a bit "rambling", but let's go with "stream of consciousness" instead. If you've read this far than you must be as crazy as me. I'm inclined to apologize for the "rambling" of the post, but it is my fucking blog after all.  I really do appreciate you everyone who takes the time to read and post comments. I'm having a ton of fun with this thing and with the people that I've met over the last week or so because of it, especially The Good Wife. And big thanks to Pagan Moss for her kind words via email. If you haven't checked out her blog, check out the link under "Peep Show Stories". It's really changed a lot lately. She used to be a peep show performer and wrote some very interesting accounts of life in that world. Now she does something different and writes more fiction, coupled with some cool art and other stuff. She seems to be a very sweet and sincere girl. Make sure to dig through the archives - it's very good stuff.  I intended to post my current playlist here, too, but I've been at this for so long that I'm too lazy to look up and type all of the songs in here. I also wanted to post some more pictures of my darling, HUGE puppy, but they're on the other computer, haven't been hosted online yet, blah blah blah. I'll do that later.  Thanks for reading. This has been very cathartic for me. I feel better now.   A.  P.S. Could somebody please add "fuck" and all of it's derivatives into the blogger.com spelling checker? Jesus.

      Borrowed from the web, available on many different sites:  Arthur Dent  Arthur Dent is a fictional character, the hapless protagonist in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams. Along with Ford Prefect, Dent barely escapes the Earth's destruction as it is annihilated to make way for a hyperspace bypass.  Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle. He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.

      I just now finally had the chance to sit down and read through some more of The Good Wife's blog, and I gotta tell ya, this lady is one hot mamacita. If you haven't checked it out, go right now. You can read my crappy posts later.  For all of you pervs (like me), there's no pictures of her there that I've seen. Though admittedly I haven't read through all of the archives. Much better - dirty sex stories. Erotica, for those of you that are more artistic about such matters. I, too, enjoy erotica, but to me they're still just dirty sex stories for smart people.  Go now. Send her love from me. And beg her to send me a pair of her panties . . .  Oh yeah, here's a picture of my hot, throbbing member for The Good Wife  C=======8  OK, seriously  C==8

      So I'm in Atlanta. Buckhead, specifically. Lots of cool bars, clubs, everything right fun right around the corner. I sit in my room blogging away. And a shitty room at that.  Day one of three days of "training" is complete, including homework (seriously). It sucked, but it's far from the worst I've been to in my career. There's actually some really nice people here from within the firm. My roommate, whom I never even knew existed until I got roomed with him, is a very cool guy. I had dinner with a very nice girl from our legal practice in New York. Great conversationalist, but I guess that comes with our business.  I've also been enjoying the company of the young girl I mentioned in a previous post that I'm travelling with. She's a sweetie, and it beats the hell out of not knowing anyone. It's somebody to have breakfast with and to sit around and laugh at all of the other douche bags in our training class.  All in all, I'm not a fan of Atlanta. I don't think the city has been enlightened to the concept of "customer service" yet. The attitudes of service workers, paritcularly the ones in this shitbag hotel, are a god damn joke. And I'm sure my firm is probably paying a shitload of money for the room, too. My biggest issue for this shithole of a town is how SSSSLLLLOOOOWWWWLLLLYYYY everyone moves. "In a minute" down here means more like in fifteen minutes, after I get done doing whatever I'm doing, then bullshit with my friend for a few minutes, then do something else, then get around to helping you. And God forbid you should become impatient - then the attitude comes out.  Losers.  A.

      Whoo Hoo! I got my first comments, and they are from a very cool girl by the name of The Good Wife. I don't have much time to type this AM, as I need to get my shit together for the dreaded trip to Atlanta, but I wanted to jump on to link up The Good Wife and send her some love via the blog.  She also has a very cool blog of her own. I highly recommend a  urlLink visit . I only had a time to read a couple recent posts, but I like it. She seems very cool. She just posted the online Dante's Inferno Test. I don't want to steal her thunder, but you should definitely check it out (if you even know what Dante's Infero is). It will help all of you hell-bound heathens to see what you're in for. She's linked on the list down below, too.  Well, I know I said I would keep this confidential, and The Good Wife might be mad me for this, but here's a picture of us together. This is me playing my air guitar solo from the new song that I wrote for her called I Want To Rock Your Body (To The Break Of Dawn).     Good Wife, you are my first (and only), and we'll always have that . . .  8/5/04 Update - check out the audio of my air guitar solo  urlLink here .   A.

      Yes, it's true, I hate my fucking job.  I hate my fucking career.  I hate the fact that I actually have to prostitue myself to the cocksuckers of the world so that I can afford to take care of my wife and have a decent life.  Fuck.  I'm travelling the next two days for some mandatory bullshit training for my job. I'll be down in Buckhead in Atlanta. I'm not into it at all. I've travelled on business for several years and I've been happy to NOT be travelling anymore. Suffice it to say that the romanticism wears off after a couple of years. Not to mention that I'm not getting paid when I'm away from the office. Fuck.  So, I've got to go sit in some bullshit classes that I am probably more qualified to teach than the teacher, then participate in "group projects" and "role plays". Lots of fun for a social cripple like me.  Maybe this will prove to be a good opportunity for a little "remote blogging". They've got wireless access in my hotel, and I've already swindled my tight ass boss into paying the small fee for it. I guess I shouldn't bitch too much - he actually volunteered to pick up the tab for a taxi cab to the hotel. Corporate policy literally requires that I take the public trans train. Personally, I don't care much. I find public trans to be a bit "adventurous". However, I'm travelling with a little 25 year old girl that's never travelled on business before. She's new in the job and it will be a miracle if I can get her through the airport without incident, let alone on to the right train going in the right direction. And no, she's not someone I would bang. Chances are that I could if I wanted to, as it seems that she idolizes me (go figure), but I don't cheat on my wife, even when I'm that far away. Not that I'm not tempted, I just don't.  I need to go pack and catch a buzzzzzz. I'll probably be back later.  A.

      Damn. For easy as this blogging stuff is, adding pictures blows in a big way. For whoever is in charge of making this stuff as easy as it is, please spend a little time on the photo side.  For those of you just learning how to blog, like me, it's not that terribly hard, but be prepared for a little bit of html. I don't know shit about it, but I did figure out how to cut and paste code. Don't even bother wasting your time fucking with this Hello and Picasa shit. They bill it as "an easy way to add photos to your blog". Well, that's true, but only if you want everything else about your blog completely fucked up. Don't waste your time on the download.  There's one sure fire, easy way to do this and make your pictures stick. Since I feel so smart for figuring it out, I'll share the details here.  1) Find a free place to host your pictures online. I use photobucket and recommend it for two reasons. First, they're cool about hotlinking pictures and second, they give you the html tag all set to go so it's a nice easy cut and paste operation. Actually, make that three reasons - they're free.  2) Go into your blog and type the text in your post that you want to appear before the photo.  3) Go to the html editing window for the post. Don't worry, you don't need to understand any crazy, computer looking shit in there you see.  4) Paste in the html tag from the picture that you want in photobucket.  5) Finish your post.  6) Publish.  That's it! You now have blog-o-graphs. A great way to post pictures of cartoon characters flipping off your readers.  A thousand apologies to anyone who stopped by in the last day during my blog-o-graph "transition" period. Things weren't working too good until now. Knock on wood.  While I'm on the subject, ten thousand apologies for this worthless use of server space and bandwidth. Just think of all of the kids in Ethiopia starving for free hosting.  Oh, one more blog-o-graph for the record. The puppy you've heard so much about. She's a sweetheart.

      It looks like I picked up another click today. Still no comments, but we'll get there soon enough. I guess I'm just not inspriational enough.  So it wasn't too horrible of a day for a Monday, at least not so far. I'm not a big fan of Mondays as a rule. I tend to have pretty good weekends and that makes it tough to head back to the rat race on Monday. Obviously I don't love my job. I don't really hate it either, it's just there. It's intellectually stimulating enough to keep me engaged most of the time, but not something I can get terribly passionate about. I really should seek out a new career path, but that takes motivation . . .  In spite of what my previous, brooding posts may have led you to believe, this wasn't the worst weekend ever. Far from the best, but not too painful. I tend to be a real homebody - I've assembled a lot of fun things around me so I don't need to leave home for entertainment. Also contrary to any impression I may have made earlier, I love my wife and my dogs. I don't believe that my wife and I are "soulmates", but I'm certain that we've been together in many other lives and we really are a great match for each other. We're both a little fucked up, but our psychoses compliment each other. She's got major male abandoment issues and is inclined to try to please everyone all of the time. I tend to be extremely, unrealistically demanding and I like to be waited on hand and foot all of the time. It works well for us most of the time.   So how bad do mood swings have to be before you're technically considered "manic depressive"? Can somebody advise? (Blatant hint - please comment)    So, back to me being a homebody. I've always been a bit antisocial. I tend to carefully select like minded (read fucked up) people to be around and then build deep relationships. I'm not want to socialize with hordes of cattle. I do, however, need my significant other around. I'm lucky with my current wife - we have so much in common that it works out well for both of us. We're usually pretty happy to just hang out by ourselves with out darling dogs. Here's some of the fun stuff I've managed to put together for our entertainment:  - A nice big house, 3300 sq ft, 4 bdrm/4 bath, just for us two and the dogs - big ass (40,000 gallon) swimming pool and spa - pool table, wet bar, dartboard - best suited for entertaining - huge kitchen - I love to cook, only eclisped by my love for eating - fully loaded woodshop - I go through phases where I'm heavily into cabinet/furniture making and woodturning (perhaps more on that later) - 65" big screen TV with full digital surround sound, high definition. Nice. - Playstation 2 and Xbox with shitloads of games - nice little music studio - all my instruments and a little digital recording setup - huge bedroom, killer king size bed, big screen and dvd back there, too - all types of herb smoking devices. Ahhhhhhhh.  Would you ever leave? Probably, unless you're a social reject like me.  I don't mean to sound materialistic, because I'm really not, at least not any more than any other red blooded American capitalist. I've had a few good financial years, and I've managed to get some really fun and cool shit. Now that I'm broke again I'm glad it's all paid for, except for the house, of course.  We're really not completely broke, I just recently left my management position of several years in favor of a 100% commission role as a so-called "individual contributor". Given time, we'll be making plenty of $ again. The income is tight now, but I socked away alot when the getting was good. Dad raised me to be smart with my moolah. That management shit is for the birds. That's why they pay so much. Fuck that shit. I only need to be worrying about one person's career - mine. Well, that and my wife's, but she's got hers under control. Actually, she's kicking ass and taking names right now. I love her.  So, back to me not leaving the house. I'm not totally Howard Hughes or anything, I just really like to chill at home. I'm not big on the unwashed masses. Unfortunately, my most common ventures out involve home repair and improvements. Yes, I do resemble Frank the Tank in that respect. It's just that something is always fucking breaking in this fucking place. If not that, we're remodeling, or we're re-landscaping, or re-wiring, or re-fucking something. Damn. I'm definitely a VIP at Home Depot and Lowes. This house hasn't been updated in, like, centuries, so we're gradually working our way room by room through the whole joint. Fortunately, we can do most of it ourselves so the only cost is the materials and the time. We just completely re-did my studio and, I have to say, it is killer.  Maybe I should develop a post about my new found alter ego . . .  Everybody, all together now. . .    FRANK THE TANK, FRANK THE TANK

      Fuck me. I just wrote a long post and managed to lose it without saving. This fucking Monday is off to a great start.  I don't have time to re-write now, but I will re-emphasize the imporant point - thank you for visiting. It looks like a couple of people dropped in over the weekend, and I'm pretty pumped about that. Probably they were accidental clicks, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.  I'd love to see some comments to help fuel interaction going forward, even if they're bad, so let it rip. Even if it's just a comment to say  that you didn't stop by by accident, that you hated it and never will come back again, that's cool. At least I'll know that you really were here.  I have to go check out some porn before it's time to hit the showers and enter that rat race. This week is going to suck (don't they all?). More on that later.  Rock on.  A.

      I'm not generally one to get super politically involved, though I do tend to hold pretty strong opinions on politics and politicians. Probably the single greatest issue for me, in politics and in life, is individual character. That being considered, I feel obligated to pass on a bit of detail about John Kerry that's recently come to my attention.  All of his supporters are making him out to be some sort of text book American hero, the distinguished war veteran and all. Based upon this info, I think it's pretty easy to see that he's really got only one motivation, and that's his personal political advancement. Everything he's done throughout his adult life has been specifically carried out with one goal in mind - gaining as much power as possible. This jackass is all about being powerful, NOT about being fair, representing public opinion, or making the lives of Americans better. He's been know to do those things, but ONLY when it served his personal goal of gaining more power. He's lowest form of shit on the face of  the Earth, a true Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.  Bush may not be a saint, and he's definitely not a rocket scientist, but I believe he'd do anything at any personal expense to carry out the duties of his job the best he can. Sure, he's made some mistakes, but what President hasn't? In fact, what individual hasn't? I think the mistakes he's made were classic examples of using your best judgement to make a challenging decision, fucking up a little, learning from the mistake and moving on. That's life, folks.   Check this out, quotes from John Kerry's fellow soldiers during his brief period of "distinguished service". Disclaimer: I do not know these people, I have not collected these quotes myself, I'm merely passing on information that was recently shared with me. I have no reason to believe it's not true, but if it is PLEASE comment here and I'll correct it.  =======================================  John Kerry's shipmates speak out!   "We resent very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming back from Vietnam in 1971 and repeated in the book "Tour of Duty." We think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our unit and other units in Vietnam. We think that he knew he was lying when he made the charges, and we think that they're insupportable. We intend to bring the truth about that to the American people. We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit to be the Commander-in-Chief."  -- John O'Neill, spokesman, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth     "I do not believe John Kerry is fit to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the United States. This is not a political issue. It is a matter of his judgment, truthfulness, reliability, loyalty and trust -- all absolute tenets of command. His biography, 'Tour of Duty,' by Douglas Brinkley, is replete with gross exaggerations, distortions of fact, contradictions and slanderous lies. His contempt for the military and authority is evident by even a most casual review of this biography. He arrived in-country with a strong anti-Vietnam War bias and a self-serving determination to build a foundation for his political future. He was aggressive, but vain and prone to impulsive judgment, often with disregard for specific tactical assignments. He was a 'loose cannon.' In an abbreviated tour of four months and 12 days, and with his specious medals secure, Lt.(jg) Kerry bugged out and began his infamous betrayal of all United States forces in the Vietnam War. That included our soldiers, our marines, our sailors, our coast guardsmen, our airmen, and our POWs. His leadership within the so-called Vietnam Veterans Against the War and testimony before Congress in 1971 charging us with unspeakable atrocities remain an undocumented but nevertheless meticulous stain on the men and women who honorably stayed the course. Senator Kerry is not fit for command.   -- Rear Admiral Roy Hoffman, USN (retired), chairman, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth     "During Lt.(jg) Kerry's tour, he was under my command for two or three specific operations, before his rapid exit. Trust, loyalty and judgment are the key, operative words. His turncoat performance in 1971 in his grubby shirt and his medal-tossing escapade, coupled with his slanderous lines in the recent book portraying us that served, including all POWs and MIAs, as murderous war criminals, I believe, will have a lasting effect on all military veterans and their families. Kerry would be described as devious, self-absorbing, manipulative, disdain for authority, disruptive, but the most common phrase that you'd hear is requires constant supervision.'"  -- Captain Charles Plumly, USN (retired)      "Thirty-five years ago, many of us fell silent when we came back to the stain of sewage that Mr. Kerry had thrown on us, and all of our colleagues who served over there. I don't intend to be silent today or ever again. Our young men and women who are serving deserve no less."   -- Andrew Horne    "In my specific, personal experience in both coastal and river patrols over a 12-month period, I never once saw or heard anything remotely resembling the atrocities described by Senator Kerry. If I had, it would have been my obligation to report them in writing to a higher authority, and I would certainly have done that. If Senator Kerry actually witnessed or participated in these atrocities or, as he described them, 'war crimes,' he was obligated to report them. That he did not until later when it suited his political purposes strikes me as opportunism of the worst kind. That he would malign my service and that of his fellow sailors with no regard for the truth makes him totally unqualified to serve as Commander-in-Chief."  -- Jeffrey Wainscott    "I signed that letter because I, too felt a deep sense of betrayal that someone who took the same oath of loyalty as I did as an officer in the United States Navy would abandon his group here (points to group photo) to join this group here (points to VVAW protest photo), and come home and attempt to rally the American public against the effort that this group was so valiantly pursuing. It is a fact that in the entire Vietnam War we did not lose one major battle We lost the war at home ... and at home, John Kerry was the Field General."   -- Robert Elder      "My daughters and my wife have read portions of the book 'Tour of Duty.' They wanted to know if I took part in the atrocities described. I do not believe the things that are described happened. Let me give you an example. In Brinkley's book, on pages 170 to 171, about something called the 'Bo De massacre' on November 24th of 1968... In Kerry's description of the engagement, first he claimed there were 17 servicemen that were wounded. Three of us were wounded. I was the first..."  -- Joseph Ponder    "While in Cam Rahn Bay, he trained on several 24-hour indoctrination missions, and one special skimmer operation with my most senior and trusted Lieutenant. The briefing from some members of that crew the morning after revealed that they had not received any enemy fire, and yet Lt.(jg) Kerry informed me of a wound -- he showed me a scratch on his arm and a piece of shrapnel in his hand that appeared to be from one of our own M-79s. It was later reported to me that Lt.(jg) Kerry had fired an M-79, and it had exploded off the adjacent shoreline. I do not recall being advised of any medical treatment, and probably said something like 'Forget it.' He later received a Purple Heart for that scratch, and I have no information as to how or whom. Lt.(jg) Kerry was allowed to return to the good old USA after 4 months and a few days in-country, and then he proceeded to betray his former shipmates, calling them criminals who were committing atrocities. Today we are here to tell you that just the opposite is true. Our rules of engagement were quite strict, and the officers and men of Swift often did not even return fire when they were under fire if there was a possibility that innocent people -- fishermen, in a lot of cases -- might be hurt or injured. The rules and the good intentions of the men increased the possibility that we might take friendly casualties."  -- Commander Grant Hibbard, USN (retired)    "Lt. Kerry returned home from the war to make some outrageous statements and allegations ... of numerous criminal acts in violation of the law of war were cited by Kerry, disparaging those who had fought with honor in that conflict. Had warcrimes been committed by US forces in Vietnam? Yes, but such acts were few and far between. Yet Lt. Kerry have numerous speeches and testimony before Congress inappropriately leading his audiences to believe that what was only an anomaly in the conduct of America's fighting men was an epidemic. Furthermore, he suggested that they were being encouraged to violated the law of war by those within the chain of command. Very specific orders, on file at the Vietnam archives at Texas Tech University, were issued by my father [Admiral Elmo Zumwalt] and others in his chain of command instructing subordinates to act responsibly in preserving the life and property of Vietnamese civilians."  -- Lt. Col. James Zumwalt, USMC (retired)      "We look at Vietnam ... after all these years it is still languishing in isolated poverty and helplessness and tyranny. This is John Kerry's legacy. I deeply resent John Kerry's using his Swift boat experience, and his betrayal of those who fought there as a steppingstone to his political ambitions."  -- Barnard Wolff    "In a whole year that I spent patrolling, I didn't see anything like a war crime, an atrocity, anything like that. Time and again I saw American fighting men put themselves in graver danger trying to avoid collateral damage. When John Kerry returned to the country, he was sworn in front of Congress. And then he told my family -- my parents, my sister, my brother, my neighbors -- he told everyone I knew and everyone I'd ever know that I and my comrades had committed unspeakable atrocities."  -- David Wallace    "I served with these guys. I went on missions with them, and these men served honorably. Up and down the chain of command there was no acquiescence to atrocities. It was not condoned, it did not happen, and it was not reported to me verbally or in writing by any of these men including Lt.(jg) Kerry. In 1971, '72, for almost 18 months, he stood before the television audiences and claimed that the 500,000 men and women in Vietnam, and in combat, were all villains -- there were no heroes. In 2004, one hero from the Vietnam War has appeared, running for President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief. It just galls one to think about it."  -- Captain George Elliott, USN (retired)      "During the Vietnam War I was Task Force Commander at An Thoi, and my tour of duty was 13 months, from the end of Tet to the beginning of the Vietnamization of the Navy units. Now when I went there right after Tet, I was restricted in my movements. I couldn't go much of anyplace because the Vietcong controlled most of the area   When I left, I could go anywhere I wanted, just about. Commerce was booming the buses were running, trucks were going, the waterways were filled with sampans with goods going to market, but yet in Kerry's biography he says that our operations were a complete failure. He also mentions a formal conference with me, to try to get more air cover and so on. That conference never happened..."  -- Captain Adrian Lonsdale, USCG (retired) .     "I was in An Thoi from June of '68 to June of '69, covering the whole period that John Kerry was there. I operated in every river, in every canal, and every offshore patrol area in the 4th Corps area, from Cambodia all the way around to the Bo De River. I never saw, even heard of all of these so-called atrocities and things that we were supposed to have done. This is not true. We're not standing for it. We want to set the record straight."  -- William Shumadine    "In 1971, when John Kerry spoke out to America, labeling all Vietnam veterans as thugs and murderers, I was shocked and almost brought to my knees, because even though I had served at the same time and same unit, I had never witnessed or participated in any of the events that the Senator had accused us of. I strongly believe that the statements made by the Senator were not only false and inaccurate, but extremely harmful to the United States' efforts in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Tragically, some veterans, scorned by the antiwar movement and their allies, retreated to a life of despair and suicide. Two of my crewmates were among them. For that there is no forgiveness. "  -- Richard O'Meara      "My name is Steve Gardner. I served in 1966 and 1967 on my first tour of duty in Vietnam on Swift boats, and I did my second tour in '68 and '69, involved with John Kerry in the last 2 1/2 months of my tour. The John Kerry that I know is not the John Kerry that everybody else is portraying. I served alongside him and behind him, five feet away from him in a gun tub, and watched as he made indecisive moves with our boat, put our boats in jeopardy, put our crews in jeopardy ... if a man like that can't handle that 6-man crew boat, how can you expect him to be our Commander-in-Chief?"  -- Steven Gardner      "I served in Vietnam as a boat officer from June of 1968 to July of 1969. My service was three months in Coastal Division 13 out of Cat Lo, and nine months with Coastal Division 11 based in An Thoi. John Kerry was in An Thoi the same time I was. I'm here today to express the anger I have harbored for over 33 years, about being accused with my fellow shipmates of war atrocities. All I can say is when I leave here today, I'm going down to the Wall to tell my two crew members it's not true, and that they and the other 49 Swiftees who are on the Wall were then and are still now the best."  -- Robert Brant      "I never saw, heard of, or participated in any Swift boat crews killing cattle, poisoning crops, or raping and killing civilians as charged by John Kerry, both in his book and in public statements. Since we both operated at the same time, in the same general area, and on the same missions under the same commanders, it is hard to believe his claims of atrocities and poor planning of Sea Lord missions.  >I signed this letter because I feel that he used Swift boat sailors to proclaim his antiwar statements after the war, and now he uses the same Swift boat sailors to support his claims of being a war hero. He cannot have it both ways, and we are here to ask for full disclosure of the proof of his claims."  -- James Steffes

      I just got an email about some crazy class action lawsuit against PayPal. Apparently a couple people have filed suit against them based upon a couple violations of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. I did some digging and looks like anyone who opened an account with them since 1999 is elligible to be a class participant.  I've never had a problem with PayPal, but I'm also not one to turn down free money.  All you have to do is fill out a form and they'll send you your $50 portion of the $9.25 million, sans a $1 processing charge. It seems fairly silly since I've never had anything but great service from them, but who am I to second guess the judgement of our prisitine justice system?  God I love to see the system at work. I feel like I'm making a difference today in cleaning up the brutal misinterpretation of the ETFA. And thanks for the free money, PayPal. I believe it when I see it.
