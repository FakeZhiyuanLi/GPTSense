      Welcome! This is my first blog and therefore my first blog posting. My girlfriend thinks I need an outlet to vent, I think I need an outlet to  vet . In the coming days, weeks, and months I'm going to be  vetting  and  venting  on what I think are today's most important events. For those of you who don't know me I'm a 27 male born and raised on the outskirts of Boston, home to my least favorite person du jour, Senator John Kerry. I look forward to trying this whole blog thing out and I can't wait to see what kind of feedback I get.  Bless the US and Thanks for reading.

       Seriously, who is John F. Kerry and what has he ever done for me? I've lived around Boston my whole life and I can't think of one thing he's done, good or bad, for this state.      Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?      What I do know about John Kerry is what I have come to learn since John announced the start of his campaign, with no thanks to the major media because learning the truth about John is the last thing they want us to do.   I wasn't born yesterday, I have a healthy pessimism about all politicians. I don't think Bush is a choir boy and Kerry the devil. I think President Bush is mostly good and Kerry's...still the devil. If I thank the major media for  anything , and lately believe me I don't, its for giving us Bob Woodward, the first man to pull back the curtain and reveal how the city of Oz was really run. The lesson Mr. Woodward taught all of us was to always have a healthy suspicion of our politicians because there is more than good reason to be.    Of course that was all before my time, but I did see a movie about the whole thing-(T hangs Mr. Woodward for busting that crook Nixon, but seriously who was Deep Throat? You've got to put that in your will or something.)  It was that ingrained healthy suspicion that caused me do a little double-take when I heard John Kerry had a book he wouldn't re-publish. Why would someone publish a book and then refuse to re-print it? Call me stupid but isn't that the mark of success? Its true too, he didn't re-print it, I checked it out. The books called,  The New Soldier  published in '71. It sells for $500+ on  urlLink www.ebay.com  but I've seen copies (obviously illegal) for $15 on the internet. That was the first little tid bit of info about John, but definitely not the last and I have to admit I haven't read the book yet. Its driving me nuts, I located a reference copy in my library and since I don't have the 500 bucks I'll have to sit in the  library  to read it. The sacrifices I'll make...   I have to admit that even before Mr. Nobody announced he was running I was, and still am a Bush supporter. I can thank Bob Woodward a second time for that as well. Mr. Woodward is personally responsible for the reaffirmation of my belief that President Bush is the right man at the right time. There were a few dark days awhile back where I almost lost my faith, but along came,  Plan of Attack  by none other than Mr. Woodward, and once again he pulled back the curtain. Only this time he revealed, among other things, a smart cautious man with the resolve to get the job done.    I'm pretty much aware of most of Bush's warts and I accept them because I'm not looking for Mr. Perfect. In fact, I didn't vote for Bush. I thought he was a little daddy's boy who didn't have the sac to lay it on the line in Vietnam. I voted Clinton and then Nadar.   9-11-01 changed all that. When we need him, when I needed him, when everyone needed him, President Bush was there. I will always remember that. Bush stepped up when we needed a leader to step up.   So, when John came along I went  looking  for what I ended up finding, and I'll freely admit that. Mr. Kerry is so many bad things in my opinion that my mind has trouble deciding which one to concentrate on first. So many! It's so bad that once you start digging you literally can't help but search for the end of it all.   John F. Kerry once led people to believe he was Irish for his own political gain! He's not Irish and his stupid campaign staff tries to deny he ever lead people to believe otherwise. The only problem with the staff's claim is that John Kerry's written statements are a matter of record. Secondly, there is a earlier draft of the very same written statement that clearly states he's Irish and it was revised to only leave the impression John Kerry was Irish. They actually revised it!    These small transgressions could probably been overlooked if I could think of one single thing that John has done for me or my state. Most the people of my state overlook a  murder  every few years to re-elect Ted Kennedy. I'm sure we could overlook a book and a little misdirection from John. See Ted brings home the bacon. Isn't that what they call it in Oz, 'bacon'? No wait they call it  pork , same difference though. What has John brought back?   Actually, I shouldn't mislead you readers, John Kerry has many more "transgressions" in his closet, but even if you want to blind yourself to  all  of them, much like the major media does, you can't put up anything in the Kerry plus column. He's a bad investment anyway you look at it. Well actually, to many Americans he does have  one  plus, he controls all the ketchup cause the billion-dollar woman owns that "Benedict Arnold" company Heinz. As a comedian much funnier than myself put it, "I'm sorry, I didn't want to do it, but if you don't vote for me I'm taking away all the ketchup."
