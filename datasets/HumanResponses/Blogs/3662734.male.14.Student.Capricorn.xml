       Welcome to my online journal. My name is BeauW and I live on the Gold Coast, Australia. I am fourteen years old and currently attend yr. 9 at my local high school. I have many friends, but only a few. I currently do not have a girlfriend, but I am looking.  I spend most of my free time on my computer. I like designing websites, banners and awards. I am currently working a new website which is a dark community for goth teenagers or anyone who is interested in the dark and gloomy.  I am a gothic teenager myself. I have been since January this year. I like it and do not rejret converting to the subculture. I don't care what people think of me. They can all get fucked. I don't have a life. Like I said, I spend most of my free time on my computer. I do get out sometimes though.  My interests are; dark shit (dark, gloomy, black, ghosts, paranormal, vampires, haunted houses, spiders, death, all that other type of shit), computers (internet, web design), music (darkwave, gothic, depressive, metal, rock, punk rock), creative shit (art, writings), film (horror, mystery, thriller, crime), mental health (study of mental disorders, human behaviour, behaviour paterns) and counsilling (communicating with teenagers who have problems in their lives, especially teenagers who want to commit suicide or abuse themselves).  I plan to finish high school (yr. 12) and move to Sydney, Australia to live. There I intend to go to University and study graphic art (commercial art) and graphic design. I also want to be a counsillor (that is if I don't get into graphic art). When I finish my study at University, I plan to stay in Sydney for a few years, hopefully moving to London to live my life out...  This closes my first entry to my online journal. I shall continue to post entries about my everyday life as a gothic teenager. Welcome to my jounal!

       Been a while since I was last here. I've been busy with shit in my life. Last weekend my mum went away & my older brother came up from where he lived to look after us. I thought it would be torture and the worst weekend ever, but it turned out allright. He didnt bann me from my computer (which I thought he might of) and we saw Shrek 2 at the movies and played with the footy at the park.  Worked some more on my website. Updated design layout. Added some more webpages. Still not finished. Making websites really takes time...  Was sick today and had the day off. My younger brother was hit by a car yesterday and he has had the day off also. He has brused all of his right arm and his back is completely grased. He should be fine though...  Reading more of my book for English, Dracula (Bram Stoker). It is getting to the really good points. Must get off computer soon and start reading some more. (mem. find a biography on someone interesting).
