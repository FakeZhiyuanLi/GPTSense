      I learned today that I am evidently not priviledged enough to be told about Reid's life anymore...  But I have no idea why.  Anyway what did I do today?  Essay test in English on To kill a Mockingbird, which we got not nearly enough time for, easy geometry test, and got recruited for math league, almost felt like Katie was "asking" me to do something. She's our pastor's wife, who when she asks you to do something, she is really telling you to do it.  Something Bonnie likes to do too.  Gym was fun again today, my hand didn't hurt much, but I've decided that I just can't do handstands (and most things that you need to do them for) but its fun anyway.  mhmm so yeah.. Band is getting really boring.  I like Mr. carroll better for church music things.  He's not so crabby then.

      I doubt If I'll get a five on this one :P but at least I finnished!!! ah but that was not very fun... oh well next quarter me and alex are doing a presentation on something.  I think we should do something strange like nate, he presented on duct tape today although not in my class (he claims duct tape and "Duck" tape are the same thing, I disagree)  I can't wait for tomorow, going to the dells with alex and jemberg for al's b-day.  which reminds me of this morning in english jemberg was talking about it and sean's like "the dells? when?"  Evidently alex forgot to tell jem not to tell other people about it... so anyway sean was sorta pissed but i think he understood.  Hmmm i think i may just tell al and jemberg what i havent told... i'm getting tired of waiting for myself to tell someone.  oh yes you guys will be surprised at this one...  well, gnight

      What the heck is all this about Mr. Banana Peel?  I mean assigning a 200 point project on stuff you never taught us the week that an extra credit project is due, which we happen to have no choice but to do?  Halle's TV comp wasn't even that....  Um yeah so that sumarizes the mood I'm in.  yeah so lets go through my schedule and see what boring and dumb things I did today.   English - took the first part of the To Kill A Mockingbird test.  Boring. Homeroom - finnished my 8.1.04 drawing and conversed with al.  Not bad, but only 7 minutes  Bio - Mr G talked about monohybrid crosses.  I wasn't too tired today at least but... boring.  EASH - started the power point presentation, got mad at the stupid macs and the school for thinking i shouldn't be able to save, but all in all, finding constitution resources is, boring.  Lunch - As usual, boring, and todays lunch fishsticked.  ABS - Semi exciting, did a little 5 minute excel assignment, learned from the grade sheet that i'm getting an A, and then took care of a small termite problem with a hammer, flamethrower, machine gun, and a set of rubber stamps.  LOL  Gym - Also not bad, although after a few cartwheels and (attempted) handsprings my hand started hurting.  Geometry - Boring.  Review for the test tomorow.  German - Manlick was gone, class was canceled, so i cleaned out my german folder in study hall.  Boring.  Band - Learned from mr carroll that mary and reid are always, the first 2 people to come in, as I was the third today.  Other than that he stopped WAY too much on Mission Imposible and one of the other ones, but we finnally got to play Low Rider again so that was good.   So then, that makes 6 out of 9 hours boring.  what a great day. Anyway, I should go work on my Shrouds of Glory report, later everyone!

      Well, today the rest of my day, the schedule is: EASH homework.  Such great fun... Ahh, no.  Yup so pretty much I just came here to say hello.  I think I'll make it a habbit to end each post with a picture.  So, today's is a pic of the ocean in Corolla (Outer Banks, NC)  As before, click for an enlargement.  There is no back button but if you right click and choose back from the popup menu you'll get back here.     urlLink

      Well lets just face it... Mr. Banana Peel shouldn't teach.  He is soooo... UGHHHHHH!  Ohhhhh but that would be a laugh... in 50 years I imagine he'll be just like Halle. lol.  anyway theres not much happenin here, about the only thing on TV is terminator 1 and I don't especially like that movie.  perhaps i will go play towers or something.  I think i've inched my way back up to around 1500 by now.  yeah so nobody has any idea what i'm talking about cuz your lives are so boring... lol    Hmmm who should I tell? everyone eventually but who will be the first i wonder?  haha now you'll be dying to know what my secret is... I've narrowed it down to 4 people who I might tell first... maybe it'll be the first one of those four to ask me.  hey that reminds me the other day i wrote this crazy poem thing in my planner accross the tops of all the pages.  it was kinda fun actaully. Here we go:    You're standing in the street, and then you think, "Why the heck am I standing in the street?"  And just as your beginnning to turn and leave, it hits you, gushing by you as if someone opened a door and cold air is rushing in.  And then you realize your mistakes, and figure standing in the road isn't such a weird thing to do anyway.    Crazy i say, absolutely CRAY-Z! lol    The pic below is the Milwaukee Art Museum, which looks something like a combination of a ship and a butterfly...  click it for a bigger picture.     urlLink

      As you know, yesterdays word of the day was facetious.  I think I managed to use it about 20 times yesterday.  Today's word is cliché, and if you dont know what it means, well you'll just have to look it up.   urlLink Here  is a good place.  My joke yesterday was "the easiest way to define cliché is three letters long 'lol' "  It was great fun.  Yup so lets see what happened yesterday... I learned that I was invited to something I wasn't invited to.  Then I learned that I was invited to something I was invited to after not being invited to it, then I learned that I was going to it.  Yup so that was my night, we watched legally blonde and how to deal at Jenni's house, then went home.

      The cool word for today is facetious:  fa·ce·tious  (fuh-see-shus) 1.  adj.  Playfully jocular; humorous: facetious remarks.  Some cool synonyms for facetious: farcical, flippant, jocular, waggish, whimsical, comical, frivolous, jocund, jocose, zippy

      The following are some of my new words.  Yes some of them are stolen from my friends, but oh well.  The first part (before the "/") is the english pronunciation, and the second (after the "/") is the real spelling (for words in different languages).   urlLink This  is a good site for finding some good words.   szhamma/llama - I'm not sure what it means, if anything, but evidently in argentinean "ll" is pronounced like a soft J.  In german, it would be spelled "schamma."  Szhamma is usually used as an exclamation, such as "Szhamma!" although it can also be used as a noun, i.e. "Don't be a szhamma."  pasae/passer - Also a french word, I have no clue what this one means either, but I do know it's an infinitive form verb.  Since I know it's a verb, I decided to use it as a verb, although, like szhamma, it means next to nothing.  By the way, in german, it'd be "paßee."  (dee) gesheershpoolmachina/(die) Geschirrspülmaschine - German for dishwasher.  Just altogether a cool word.  Just a side note, the umlauted "ü" is pronounced more like "eww" than "oo" but it's a subtle difference.  fishsticks - A word Erik Johnson used to say all the time, it's similar to "Shoot!" and can't be used for good things.  peaches & peachy - Peaches I use similarly to fishsticks, except with good things.  Peachy is a synonym to super or great.  mofo - I'm sure many of you know what this word is short for, and that it generally means a good friend, similar to "homey" although to me sometimes it means what it really is short for.  Kustom Fooder - A phrase we used a lot in ABS today, one of the wisefools came up with it.  I'm sure you can guess it means "Custom Footer"  wisefool - synonymous to sophmore, which does in fact mean wise fool in some language.  I use it as a noun for sophs as well as an insult to anyone who's not one.  hoser - an idiot.    Lunch was quite interesting today.  Angie and her "Jo-Jo Po-Ta-Toes" and that she "wants to beat Mr. Thompson with a polish sausage."  And then Logan decides to mix things up and asks Luke if he would make out with Mary; he said "I'd rather make out with a cow."  Well not to be outdone, Logan says "What's the difference?"  I didn't hear it originally but Luke was nice enough to tell me so when I told Mary what logan said I left him out of it.  And so then somehow we got to talking about Mary and how she's married to "Joseph..."  it was really a szhamma of a time.

      Well, I'm back from the Kalahari, back to the usual boredom of school.  I have to work on my EASH constitution project tonite, which is not putting me in the best of moods I guess, but anyway, I think I've found a site that'll host this blog with a shorter address, AS-Hosting.  They have some fun stuff for me to play with too it looks like.  I watched alias today, since I missed it last night by going to youthgroup with Logan.  But I sorta missed Adam so I went for that too.  Ohhh but it was a good one.  Except it all seemed kinda like it had already happened.  I mean, someone always says something and then, 2 seconds later when everyone is confused and wants him/her to explain someone comes up and fills 'im with lead.  I think I figured out what Vaughn is gonna tell Syd next week though, since Lauren was then one who sniped Sark's dad.  He's gonna say "I only married Lauren because Langley told me to" and then they're gonna kiss and be saved somehow.  Anyway I gotta go eat.

      I'm quite bored.  Everyone seems to be getting ready for the dance, except reid, but i'm used to talking to more than one person.  I already read all of mary's and thea's journals, and since reid won't favoriteize me i'm stuck here with nothing to do.... perhaps I'll have to write another poem.  I think i'll do another silly rhymer like the pink mink.  "My Best Friend"  My best friend breeds Zarfs Down in the Darks. They yell, cuz they feel Swank. And they will until they turn Blank. Then my best friend will Say: Zarfs are you not here to Stay? My best friend breeds Zarfs Down in the Darks. Update... Reid let me read his diary now  I kept thinking... "Mein besten Freunden..."  as i was writing this one... lol german song manlick made us listen to once...  I seem to like 1 stanza poems lately... i wonder why... maybe cuz its so hard to find words that rhyme and make sense together... maybe I'll do some non-rhymers or somethin... It seems i also have been closing with the first two lines lately... I think i'm gonna put some poems up here from my old blog and my real journal (as in paper) although i warn you, anything i may have said in the past is not necessarily how i feel now... specifically this applies to the one about locks...

      I didn't come up with that one, its from a sign outside a church in hayward, WI, where our cabin is, but I've adopted it, along with "You Booze, You Cruise, You Loose." on a bilboard on the way to hayward one time.  Speaking of hayward, if anyone's ever been to the candy shop there it is VERY good!! ah i remember that one time when we were at the cabin and boomer started chasing the ducks down the shore and he was like 500 yards away before we caught him.  He loves the water.  but he hasn't figured out how to jump in yet.  lol.  if he's sitting on the dock and you throw something for him, he runs to the beach, then swims out for it.  Its hilarious!  anyway i'm goin to spencer school forrest in like half an hour to go skiing with my dad and boomboom.  So see you guys at winter carnival then.

       I see it was all just a dream. And now when all has come clean, Reality comes crashing down on me. Why dont people see They've messed up this world, For you and for me. I liked it better in my dream, When all had not come clean.

      I wrote two poems last night, and almost 3 but then I decided to take jenni's advice and go to bed.  so here's the first one, about life.  "This Life" This Life, takes a toll on my mind. Say "Hello", only to find, That I'm not good enough, Just like a pesky scuff. Each night I keep myself awake. I dream in color, but it's innate. When I think about This Life, I think, nobody shares my strife. And now the second one, this one's on a little lighter note.  "My Pet Mink" I have a pet mink, And he is quite pink. Occasionally I will see him wink, As he's taking a drink. And he'll blink, When writing in ink. Some people may think Minks really stink. But ask my pet mink, And he'll just turn pink. LAST DAY OF 1ST SEMESTER!!! YAY! And last day at 4th hour lunch :P  Its on to 6th hour for me.  of course I have 4th hour study hall so maybe I'll come visit you guys... maybe... lol jk i love you guys... at least usually.  Anyway later.  oh btw I got a screenshot hopefully soon i'll have more... and dont try to read it its just lipsum.  As always click for a bigger pic.   urlLink

      Ok so I should really be blogging more, but I've been redesigning the site, and it's coming along just peachy  I suppose I could post some screenshots... anyway, if you haven't heard yet, I don't like jenni, and consider yourself lucky you read this blog because i'm not making a public announcement or anything.  Yup so lets see what was good about today... NO SCHOOL! yay! and maybe (cross your fingers) it'll be to cold again tomorow and we'll have like a 5 day weekend... that'd be awesome.  anyway, as I was saying I worked on the new design today, and started a separate portion devoted to alias :P  called SD-8.  I think i'll have a screenshot of that too.  Speaking of alias, I'm thinking about having an alias party on sunday (since there's not school mon) and even though there's no new alias on ABC we'll be watching my season 1 dvd.  Yup so thats about it. so long for now.  My sis's like "is that your website?" "No It's my blog"  "Whats a blog"  "Web-log" yeah byebye

      Tell me do you think it'd be all right If I could just crash here tonight You can see I'm in no shape for driving And anyway I've got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I'd ever had If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone Tomorrow we can drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found  Now tell me, who did this?

Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  "A blind mind will find none of its kind lined behind the grind." - Me   Listening to:  It's Five O'Clock Somewhere by Alan Jackson & Jimmy Buffett  Well I'm gonna write two poems tonight now.

       Mood:  Happy (It's friday!), Sad (It was a sad day for some reason)   Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  "A blind mind will find none of its kind lined behind the grind." - Me   Listening to:  Only Hope by Switchfoot  Well it looks like I'll have the site redone by february or march perhaps (I've been taking my time... or lazy... one of the two).  Lets see I wrote a poem in the library today (4th hour study hall) as well as reading the short little assignment for english.  Reid doodled a drawing for lizzy, and lets see not much else happened the whole day.  It's only day 3 for band and I'm day 8 now so I guess I have a while still fore my next lesson.  "Once Friends" You were once friends. Harsh words you now say. You are the same, but different blends. Not a word you say, not even "Hey." You were once friends; You are the same, just different blends.  Most can think for themselves. They need not two mothers. Find an old book and put it on the shelves. Along with all the others. You were once friends; You are the same, just different blends.  You play an evil game. That hurt the other's feelings. The other one you blame. A little love might raise the ceilings. You were once friends; You are the same, just different blends. -Thursday, January 29, 2004   "Behind the Grind" A blind mind will fine none of its kind lined behind the Grind -Thursday, January 29, 2004   "It's a shame" It's a shame That the plain Has no grain  It's a shame That the plain Has such pain  It's a shame That the plain Is in-sane  It's a shame That the plain Will not long remain  It's a shame That the plain Has had not any rain  It's a shame That the plain Has no grain -Friday, January 30, 2004 That one I wrote in the library 4th hour, like I said.  I got another idea for a poem, I'll probably write this one tonight (haven't gone not writing every day since i started writing again) about voices in the walls... yeah I'll explain it when I blog it.  I think i'm gonna go play a game.  Later

      These two poems I wrote last night, they're not my best, but after all I have to write at least one every day :P  "Just Like a Peach Tree" Just like a peach tree On a hill.  It grows In spring storms.  It shines Like the moon.  The fruit is harvested And all is well.  It withers And turns gray.  But a seed was sown It begins to grow  Just like a peach tree on a hill.   "Over This" A flash of light A clap of black thunder The clack of tracks The clash of lightning And always the sound of rain  But over this The swan's song Is heard clear And this is my poem for English tomorow, we had to write it like the first stanza of "I wandered lonely as a cloud."  "Away We Drank the Day" I wandered sad as an abandoned old house, To be a host for not even a ghost, When all at once I saw a mouse, Who made a boast that we should have a toast, In a most mischievious way, So away we drank the day. In study hall I also came up with a new short  Poetry is finding the word that's worth a thousand pictures.  Electronics was really REALLY boring today.  yet at the same time entertaining... lol.  He (the teacher) defines Electronics as "Electricity with Intelligence"  'Something I lack' I thought he should have said after that.  Anyway I haveta do my eash homework.  Later  fyi - I have 21 poems now, made up of exactly 1800 words and spanning 374 lines. (there are others, but i know not where they are, plus they're old, and therefore, mostly crap)

      Well today started out bad, it's the first day of second semester for me (i was gone all day yesterday for math league) so I was a little nervous cuz everyone knew their schedule pretty much now except me but by lunch (6th hour now) i was having a good day.  I had jazz band this morning... and i totally slept through my alarm so i was late... but mr caroll didn't care, he needs all the trombones he can get :P  And then school started and we're doing poetry in English and its totally cool except that the things where we're supposed to write poems its write it like so and so would not write it like you would, so I decided not to to the poem for today.  Bio was interesting, me and mr g laughed about a few things, and we got new seats, and I like mine better than the last, but mr G wouldn't let reid sit behind me :(  Oh and did I mention that this chapter is really boring?  ah but it wasn't bad.  And eash wasn't so fun, and study hall was really boring but I finnished my bio packet so I have nothing for assignments in that class until wednesday.  Electronics is gonna be a really really easy class I can see, the whole class is stupid practacly, but the teacher seems really leaniant.  Lunch is when the day started to get better again, I sat by jeremy and kelsi and jenna and people here actually talk... lol and everyone brings their stuff with them... nobody did that at 4th hour except like thea and eliz.  I must say, 6th hour is better than 4th :P  lets see 7th hour ohhh my he was pissed again... theres like 2wice as many people in that class now too.  german was good, we got new seats there too, and i'm like way in the back of the room, which is good, i think.  Band was ok, not the best though.  Well I wrote the new poem, and procrastinated on homework, so i'm kinda mad at that right now, and then i went to opendiary and became sad.  It seems laura noticed just about everyone who came to 6th hour lunch except me... that kind of thing never makes you feel very good.  I guess people just consider me a low maintenance friend... but its terrible being a low maintenance friend, i don't want to be one, I don't want to be the "if nobody else is around" guy.  People can be so mean sometimes... it makes me quite sad... I'm not talking about Laura... I think you know who you are... and what i'm talking about... grrrrr.  It's nobody's place to decide other's people's lives.  Sorry for being blunt, but I'm just getting tired of it all.  Anyway I'm listening to my thinking music now and that always cheers me up so I'm doing better now.  Well, it's 7:30 i should finnish my hausaufgaben (and homework)... lol

      Well I did the poem i was talking about earlier, the first if I do anymore, I'm not sure if I will.  "I wandered" I wandered as a lonely child. Make me a grave where you are. We will live in secret cities. For here we are here. Each line is actually a (usually) modified first line of some other poem.  Line 1 - The Daffodils by William Wordsworth Line 2 - Bury Me in a Free Land by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper Line 3 - The Cities Inside Us by Alberto Rios Line 4 - The Midnight by Susan Howe

      I just had a really cool idea and I'm blogging it so I don't forget.  I was doing the english thing and I read "I wandered lonely as a cloud"  and I thought "that would be better as 'I wandered as a lonely child' " and so then I was thinking hey, maybe i should make a whole poem out of lines of other poems but just changed slightly.  Or maybe if it works out well, make more than one poem, a whole new kind of poem (although thats unlikely)

      We read in English about how EE Cummings wrote a poem every day from when he was 8 to when he was 22, 14 years.  And the way things look now, it looks like I'm gonna be writing a poem every day for a while... haha actually for 14 years I figured it's 5,110 days, and therefore that many poems as well.  But I don't really like cummings' style.  I like a little more structure, not too much but not that freeform.  That's why I'm not going to ruin "Summer on the Green" by trying to redo it "cummings style."  I'll just do the easy way out and write about cats (as in, "Fog" talked about cats, that was the other option).  Anyway, 2 poems last night.  "Summer on the Green" I remember the summer on the green. Stargazing Trailblazing, The white lies Like butterflies.  So pleasant A timeless present, The summer on the green.   "A New Beginning" Rise to your feet Look to the East Blue flame mixes now With cloud This day being A new beginning You probably won't understand the last one, unless you know me very very well, and I doubt anybody knows me well enough to understand the whole thing.  (Hey I don't understand myself sometimes)  And I'm not going to explain it, you have to figure it out for yourself.  I figured out a name for my last poem, it's called "Grievance" Anyway I must be going.  Later

      Ok this seriously just ruined my day!  I am like so mad right now you wouldn't believe it.  STUPID ERRORS AND GAY COMPUTERS!! Hehe it sorta rhymes. :)  Ohkay I'm a little better now.  Anyway I had my whole post for what happened today (It was like 3 pages long) and I pressed Post and stupid blogger, with this big error message, and I'm like woah you did not just loose 2 hours of typing...  and ah I have to stop thinking about it it's making me mad again. Anyway... I'll attempt to write it again.  I guess I'll start with last night, I stayed up until like one writing in my journal (the one on paper) and I had this idea for this cool lava lamp thing and then I was looking at my pencil I was using and it had this indentation on it and the way the light shone on it it made it look like a man standing in a shadow and think ok I have to write a poem about this.  So I think what could I write about?  Well I remembered reading the Tom Clancy book "Without Remorse" then and John Kelly, if you've ever read the book you'll understand how the shadow comes into play.  If not then I'll just explain it.  John Kelly is a guy who loses everyone he loves, and eventually turns into nearly nothing more than a shadow.  Now I'm not doing justice at all to the book, but I don't feel like explaining on and on about the book, there's enough other stuff to talk about.  It's really a good book though, you should read it.  Anyway here it is:  "Grievance" A man stands in the shadows. A boy sits on the curb eating marshmallows. A baby cries in his midst. A carriage rides off into the mist.  A man sits in the alley. A storm heads for the valley. A tourist wanders in the village. A woman begins a pilgrimage.  A man sobs on the park bench. A girl speaks to him in French. A mother watches the leaves fall. A horse gallops to its stall.  A man kneels in the rain. A raven calls out in pain. A messenger shows him patience. A man puts away his grievance. I'd never have thought it'd take an hour and a half to write 16 lines of a rhymer lol  Anyway what made it hard to do was not just the rhyme pattern, that one's obvious, but actually there were 7 criteria that each line/stanza had to follow.  I'll let you see if you can find them.  After I wrote that, I was thinking, and I thought, hey maybe one of the reasons I have so much fun writing this late and it turns out actually good is that my brain turns off the part that normally says "No No No silly, that's just crazy" because it has to turn it off before you start dreaming cuz I've had lots a dreams that made no sense at all when I woke up they were so crazy but they made perfect sense during the dream.  Maybe it allows me to just write and not worry about how it will turn out.  And after that I began working on my CD again, and after finishing going through my 770 songs on Fernando and finding I had about 70 songs chosen, I decided it would probably have to be a multi-disc set. :P  So then this morning I wake up and think "What time is it?" as usual and then "Please let there be no school" and then "Do I have to get up?" and eventually I did drag myself out of bed and downstairs to the shower, and had a nice warm one (not as warm as I prefer, but ya know the shampoo says you're not supposed to use hot water, its too drying... lol) and then I went upstairs and made a bowl of oatmeal and oh my what a good bowl that was.  The perfect oatmeal... lol... Just the right temperature, hot but not too hot, just the right consistency, like pudding almost, but it was a little too runny at first so I added some brown sugar and that made it a little sweeter than it needed to be, but it was still perfect.  Well after gobbling that down and going down stairs again to put my contacts in and brush my teeth, and going upstairs for my socks and watch, and down stairs to leave I was running late.  So I hurry out the door and when we get to school I remember I left my trombone at home.  But I didn't really care.  And then before school I was just sitting around and Seany asks "So you get your permission slip for math league?  It's today you know"  And I'm like "Uh um no..."  and he's like "Oh so you're kinda screwed then huh?"  And I totally forgot that it was today, but I think ah who cares so I miss it.  So then the bell rings and I go to English and we read "Fog" by Carl Sandburg, one of my favorite poems in gradeschool, and then like 2 minutes before class is gonna end, this lady comes in and she's like "I need to see Ben out here" and so I go out in the hall and I'm thinking oh great I bet this is about forgetting my trombone at home today, and my mom's here to give it to me and then she says "we leave for math league in an hour do you have your permission slip?" and I'm like "Um no I kinda forgot" so she's like "well you HAVE to come." And I'm like "I HAVE to?" In my affirmative-yet-jocular voice that I can't really explain, but she didn't pick up on it, and she says "Is your mom or dad home?"  "No my dad's at work and my mom's teaching" so eventually she ends up first calling my house then church and talking to the secretary, then driving all the way to church just to get my mom to sign this stupid permission form.  I think she was a little pissed by the time she was done with me.  I never really figured out how you can kill yourself doing geometry anyway...  So me and seany are waiting in the commons and we decide to play that dot game where you take turns making lines and when you make a box you put your initial in it, and I almost won, if only noah hadn't told seany his little tricky move, which made it impossible for me to win.  So then we all loaded onto the big Marshfield bus and headed out.  And we talked on the way, I don't really recall about what, but I think it was geometry.  I don't remember too much about the ride there.  Well we all got out and went into the university which reminded me a lot of UW Stout, and down into this stairwell which reminded me of an art museum I was once in.  and so we sat there until just before 11 and talked some more, and seany and I wrote notes to each other on super sue's graphing calculator, sean's in Spanish and mine in German.  And it was really awesome neither of us had any idea what the other one was saying.  Oh and this guy had his iPod with him and it made me wish I had my Fernando, but he wasn't charged then anyway so he wouldn't have been very excited to play any tunes.  So we went up the stairs to the testing room, a very big, strangely designed room.  The walls were fancy like at a lot of Colleges and Universities, but the overhead lights were more "modern," also common in colleges and universities, but usually not in a room like this.  It's hard to explain but it just didn't go together.  Anyway we started the test and had 55 minutes, and it was quite hard.  Try this one for example.  6.  If a, b and c are distinct lines in three-dimensional space, which one of the following is true? a.  If a is parallel to b and b is parallel to c, then a, b and c always lie in the same plane b.  If a is perpendicular to b and b is perpendicular to c, then a is always parallel to c c.  If a is parallel to b and b is parallel to c, then a is always parallel to c d.  If a intersects b and b intersects c, then a always intersects c e.  If a is parallel to b and b is skew to c, then a is always skew to c  The answer was c.  Did you get that one?  I did.  You see they're not necessarily all three coplanar, but if they're not then they form 3 planes... and I'm probably just confusing you more.  So then after that we all piled back in the bus and went to Arby's and I had no money cuz I expected to be eating lunch at school today.  But sean was nice and bought me some curly fries and I wasn't all that hungry anyway so that was enough.  And we're talking and eating and sean's like "Ya know I think the practice worksheet was easier than the test" and noah's like "Yeah it had the answers on it" and it was REALLY funny., but you kinda had to be there I think.  Yup so we got on the bus (yet again) and drove home, and just about everyone slept, even though we really weren't that tired, from just math. But we slept and then we got back and I can finally say I beat R and M to band :) Yay :)  And during band I told reid about my perfect bowl of oatmeal and he said he had one like that too. Isn't that just awesome? And since I didn't have my trombone today so I played the invisible trombone and it was a very fun hour, for band anyway. (I never knew we sucked that bad though) And they needed someone to play cowbell, but mr carroll wouldn't let me or reid do it :(   And so we got home really early today too since I had all my stuff with me and then I came down and started writing this and talked to jenni some before she went to the library and now i'm talking to bobbie and emily and I've run out of things to say. So goodbye.

      Well today is a good day.  I think reid is feeling better about his slip up and ensuing depression, I donno if he figured out that my sn and short, "the one with penitence makes the best of companions" was talking about him but i hope so.  It really means that, if you feel sorry for something you did, you can't be a bad person.  And thea is doing better it seems as well.  I still wish she'd explain the pills and cough syrup but oh well.  It's good to not like anybody... its been so long since i could say that... to be free... you just dont understand it i guess until... hey wait thats another short: "Experience is the best communicator."  Anyway, gnight.

      Oh goodie, another short, maybe to take the place of the last one.  Unfourtunately its kinda sad, like most of my recent stuff, but not exactly sad when you think about it, if you understand it.  Birth is the doorway leading from the bedroom, life is the hallway, and death is the doorway to the world.  Later

      I was searching through some quotes just now and found  "To live without loving is not really to live." - Moliere  and I thought Oh no, is it possible I've read that one before and thats where i got my short:  Living life without loving is less than living  from?  I hope not... I don't remember ever reading that quote before but theyre so similar...  Anyway, i should probably go finnish bio, but chances are i'll put it off a little longer.

        "Never Said Goodbye" I came to see you on Monday, But I got stuck in traffic. When I got there you were gone; Saw your taxi pull away.  One step is all it took; One step off a stoic bridge. Into the water you went, Water under a sad bridge.  And now you're gone, oh so gone. I never will see you again. You're gone, oh so gone. Never said goodbye to you.  All those midnight drives, The rain pouring on the windshield. Lightning crashing in the distance, And in my mind.  All those tears that I have shed, Praying for help from God. Sobbing for hours on my bed, Only to cry myself to sleep.  And now you're gone, oh so gone. I never will see you again. You're gone, oh so gone. Never said goodbye to you.  All those midnight strolls. Wandering in the moonlight, Not lost, but not found. Searching for a reason for this mess.  All those things that I have said, Everything that was a lie. Searching for someone to blame, Instead of moving on with life.  And now you're gone, oh so gone. I never will see you again. You're gone, oh so gone. Never said goodbye to you.  All those things I never said Never said I Love You. All those things I never said, And now, you're dead.  -January 25, 2004 I've found it works quite well with "Too Bad" by Nickelback.  I also found that "Sooner or Later" by Fastball goes good with my poem "Locks", which i refuse to put in this blog.  As i said, this poem is for adam, and i think i'm gonnna print a copy for him.  The last stanza I just added at 3:30 today but I've been thinking about it, rephrasing it in my head since my shower this morning. All in all there are now 40 lines (not counting blank ones between stanzas).

      Well I went to youthgroup last night, and well it was boring for a while and most everyone was complaining, but then adam told us that he had a friend who had killed himself.  And so we stopped complaining and decided to just hang out for the 15 minutes before adam gave his lecture, message, whatever you wanna call it.  And so I was thinking, and then his message started and he says how usually he writes up an outline on what he wants to talk about and then on tuesday he writes it, and then the rest of the week he practices it.  But this week he was lazy and tuesday came around and he had no outline, wednesday, thursday, friday, he kept putting it off.  And then saturday rolls around and he's like oh crap its saturday and i dont have a message.  So he goes through the Bible and eventually he finds something, but then logan comes to clean the church and adam looks at it again and thinks "This sucks" so he crumples it up in a ball and chucks it. "I'll worry about it tomorrow" he thinks so he goes home and to bed and the next day he comes to church and "oh crap i don't have a message" So he prays and thinks and he can't come up with anything, and then 4:30 rolls around, then 5, then 6 (Youthgroup is at 7) and so at 6:30 he decides to take a drive.  And he prays and he's thinking about his friend, who committed suicide, and soon he comes up with his message which he says is "from his heart" But that's not the point of me telling you all this.  The point is, as he told us this and began to give his message, I got inspired to write a poem.  It's written from adam's point of view, and will probably come in the next post after this.  Other than that, the septic truck came today to empty the tanks (what great fun) and woke me up, cuz my bedrooms right by the driveway, and hmmm not much else yet, i've only been awake for like an hour.  I had coco puffs for breakfast along with some white cranberry peach juice, which isn't all that great, but it's ok i guess.  Um heres some more shorts from my journal (the paper one)  Can comprehension be comprehended?  Living life without loving is less than living. -Alliteration here too.  You are, but one of six billion people, wandering in darkness on a blue ball.  This is a poem i found the other day, but don't read into it anything about jenni, i wrote it before I liked her.  "Take Me Away" I hear you calling to me In a dream of despair. Your voice leads me. And I see your face smiling. I reach for you hand, But it is gone. You are gone. I am lost. Take me away. -May 11, 2003 And this one's from my journal.  "Firefly" Love is a firefly. It comes and goes as it pleases, And if you try to hold it against it's will, It dies. -December 16, 2003

      I thought up a cool little alliteration thing:  Maggie Makes Much Moola in Mexican Missions.  Referring to Alias in the last part :)  But there is no new Alias tonite :(  Me and bobbie were thinking up a new nickname for her and we came up with bobbie jean (aka scout) for her and B for me, so you all have to call me B now... haha  My cousin goes by B, I guess thats what makes me like it  anyway... bobbie thinks i like mary and mary thinks i like jenni still... they just don't comprehend the idea of not liking anybody  oo another short:  The probability of a secret becoming known is equal to the square of the number of people who know.  Thats enough for now maybe more later

      Well I just had lunch, 2 pieces of pizza and a fruit parfait.  mmhm so I never asked about the alias party so I don't think I'll be having it, well actually i may just make it a get together if i'm not doing anything tonite.  Heres one of my old poems  "The perversion of humanity" We ride to battle,  With rifles on our backs,  Grenades at our side.  The machines of destruction rumling in the abyss.   And somewhere, a baby is crying.  A baby is crying,  Nobody can hear it,  For they are busy with their killing.   We say that we fight for freedom;  Without imprisonment, how can there be freedom?  Gasping for breath, evil is nearly defeated.  The evil is getting stronger now.   And so the cycle repeats.  Anybody would see our mess,  Now we are preoccupied; the mess is invisible.  For they say, Out of sight, Out of mind.   We say we are civil,  We say we are humane.  Guns and bombs we make,  The perversion of humanity grows.   - July 10, 2003 I don't like it as much as much as some of my others but its ok i suppose

      Well last night was fun, despite logan following me around the whole time and complaining and the music sucking....  "Du, Du hasst, Du hasst mich" doesnt exactly work well for a dance... of course most people don't know it means you hate me.  I swear i heard gehst somewhere in there though...  I've decided, after looking through my journal, i'm not gonna post those poems (Actually i'm kinda a litttle embarrased by some parts...) I suppose a select few may one day read them, but not in this blog.  I am gonna put some other old ones in though.  If you havent figured it out yet, shorts are my word for short phrases, usually advice, that sometimes mean things more than what they say.  When I'm dead maybe they'll show up as quotes in daily planners.... lol  Today I have a few new ones (all entirely mine).  Experience is the best communicator.  The one with penitence makes the best of companions.   Some of the original shorts:  Love All, Serve All, Trust All, Forgive All. (Of course) The first part is from Hard Rock's slogan, as you probably know.  If you're going through Hell, keep moving. A sign outside a church in Hayward, this one caught my eye too.  You Booze, You Cruise, You Loose. This one was on a billboard on the way to Hayward (I've mentioned that before) And I liked it, so it became a short.   This one isn't a short, because to me shorts are things i've said or think, or things i've seen, but not quotes.  So this is considered a quote, but it means quite a bit when you read over the words (it's kinda like reading between the lines, its a mellonism):  Not all those who wander are lost. This one goes to Tolkien, I love Gandalf and Aragorn's rhetoric! I usually leave out the those, it sounds better when it's by itself.  It comes this, in the Fellowship:  All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.

       Mood:  Not great... school tomorow.   Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  melancholy (gloom; sadness)   Listening to:  Innocence Again by Switchfoot  I'm such a terrible person.  I didn't write a poem last night.  But I just couldn't bring myself to write something I didn't feel like I was supposed to.  And the only thing I had to write about was suicidal cats named laura.  And I didn't think it would turn out good and it was 12 and I was tired.  (I was at thea's bday party last night)  I reject the idea of "the clan" but if there is one, femi shouldnt be in it.  she's almost as bad as angie, but nobody is that bad so she's just mean.  Everyone has their own friends, and you dont have to be friends with your friends friends.  I still have a few poems from a few days ago to post, I've been busy lately i guess.  "One Hears Voices in these Walls" One hears voices in these walls, Voices which have no home to call their own, Voices once used in great halls, And Voices which can none but moan. Perhaps they come from this volume, It has not of late opened in bloom. -Friday, January 30, 2004   "Come Back" Why did you take Such a long vacation When will you be returning I've heard you're off On a forever-trip Taken to that place From where none return A place much better Than the one we're in Please come back Even if it is Worse here Than where You Are Friday, January 30, 2004

       Mood:  Ok i guess   Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  Es war sehr super!   Listening to:  Dispatch - Open Up  I finnally had some time to write some more!  I realized today how much I use rain and storms as figures of speech, its kinda funny actually.  I'm gonna print some stuff for my planner after i put these poems in i think.    "Like Rain" Like rain, It falls down on me. The Thunderstorm, So silently. I'm drenched. But I don't care.  For hours I walk. The mellow radiance, The gentle hum, For me they are no menace. I'm exhausted. But I don't care.  Twelve o?clock. A brawl yonder, under the clouds, But not the only one; There is one that draws no crowds. I'm confused. But I don't care.  Like rain, It falls down on me. The Thunderstorm, So silently. I'm dying. But I don't care.     "Fourty-Two" Sunset came out this morning. Sunrise slept in, Last night was busy. Moonlight is coming through the grass. Tonight, Sunshine will be bright. Earth equals six times eight.   This came from when me & Jamie were talking going to the library and he?s talking about how the answer to the universe is 42 and earth = 6*8 and that?s why the world is messed up cuz 6*8 is 48 not 42.  Crazy.

       Mood:  Hapily Sad   Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  Why is life so confusing?   Listening to:  Dispatch - Flying Horses  Mrs. Gorke had a good quote the other day: "Life is what happens while you're planning something else."  And I came up with another short today  "How can you decide something is the most beautiful thing in the world if you haven't seen the whole world?"  But I am confused again, and I hate it when I'm confused.  And I'm not telling anyone why this is so, for part of the reason that I'm confused.  I don't think I ever said, but Amy & Nick broke up, but then they got back together again, that was like 3 days ago I think.  And there was a discussion about love one day here in the basement, and it inspired me to write this poem:    "Love Is" Love is Not a feeling. Of being it is, Not a state. Not an action, Or emotion, Or point of view. Love is merely A choice. - Thursday, February 5, 2004   What else to say? I'm doin stuff for my eagle ceremony.  I'm still deciding if i'm gonna invite other people besides my friends who helped with the eagle project.  I have to do homework today too.  I should probably go.  Later!

Oh and if you're a girl, DON'T READ IT!  you probably wouldn't understand the guy.  Anyway, after that i'm gonna read "God's Debris," another book i'm borrowing from jamie.  They're both short, thats why i'm reading them.  If they were longer I'd be like, um I don't think so.  I found this article on msn called "Can Friends be Lovers?"  And it was really funny.  Um lets see I should finnish my homework now.  Later

       Mood:  Happy   Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  "Yeah well it's a hell of a lot better than both of yours!"  lol   Listening to:  The Clash - I Fought the Law  I was reading my Open Diary favs and I came across this, which is a lot like me I think ...The lynx never trusts anyone, the lynx is a loner. I do like being by myself, and with people, it really doesn't matter to me. Although for me its more that I don't trust people enough... sometimes thats a good think i guess.  Perhaps it's why nobody reallly really knows me.  Anyway, I haven't been home since 7:10 this morning.  Of course i went to school but then I wen't to jeremy's house with kelsi and we worked on our cardboard mirror (kelsi wanted to put Der Spiegel on it but we wouldn't let her... it means the mirror in german) and then jeremy dropped us off at the HS again and kelsi sold concessions and I waited for 2 hours and did homework waiting for pep band at 6:30.  I got home at 8 something.  How interesting huh?  Anyway I should go now.  Later guys

       Mood:  I dont know.  I just don't know.   Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  Peachyful   Listening to:  Evanescence - My Immortal  Well I'm waiting... and waiting... I wish it would be a little faster to get free webspace with no ads...  I wonder if they'll accept me.  I sure hope so.  Lets see we had our church dance/lock-in on fri.  Reid and Laura and I played with the balloons during the dance (nobody was dancing) cuz the music was lacking severely.  Actually it was more that there wasn't enough music.  I must have heard 10 of the songs at least twice.... thats not a good thing considering if i had a converter i coulda played 2 and a half days of music with no repeats off fernando (he's my iPod if you didn't know, which you probably didn't).  Then the lock in started, it was fun, but i think the last one was a tad better.  The same stuff happened pretty much, people played halo, we played where-is-this-in-the-church, had talks in the little side hallways in half-darkness, sat in the dark and watched people walk by lacking even a slight knowledge of us/me, sometimes scaring people, and sleeping on the pews (this time in the choir room).  The only diff was that we couldnt go in the sanctuary/nave this time.  lying under a pew waiting to scare people reminded me of a dream I had once.  I was in wal-mart (or maybe it was target) and for some reason, they were searching for me, as well as some of my friends (in the dream they were my friends, i never dream about my real friends) so i went in this room in the back, and we hid, and then i found this little hole that was about the shape of the space where i was under the pew.  And then it sortof turned into the shawshank redemption, we started digging and just before we escaped I woke up.  Now back to the lock in from that segu&eacute;.  I had a headache for part of the night so that wasnt so fun, as well as an ache of my mind which i've had for a little while now.  And no, I'm not telling you about that one, unless I feel like it, so theres no point to asking.  we had confirmation after the lockin, we had to go to sleep at 3 and i (surprisingly) didn't wake up until 8, confirmation started at 9 and it was SOOO boring.  We talked about prayer the whole time and i doodled some stuff.  And we ate thea's starbursts and folded the wrappers for a necklace (for mary i think) and then we went home and i took a shower and alex called me and asked if i wanted to come over at 7 until 11 and i'm like "I was up late last night ya know" and he's like "I know" and I'm like "ok" It was funny, and typical of us at the same time.  So I went to sleep and woke up at 5:30 and alex came at 6:50 and we had a great time.  Playing vintage pinball and poker (nick you lucky little....) and the usual and my parents wouldnt let me stay overnight. :(  And we went to Zion United Methodist today for SS and it was ok but not the best.  Well.  I think that we're finnally done.  Isn't that peachyful?  I gotta scan something for my mum now.  Later.

       Mood:  Super!   Word, Quote or Phrase of the Day:  hmm I don't know.   Listening to:  Fuel - Hemorrhage  Hey!  Sorry Alex if you tried to call me today, I forgot this was the weekend we went to Gustavus again.  Which was fun I guess but a little boring.  But I guess I learned it can be fun to go someplace far away without intending to do anything in particular.  But I wish I had a camera with me.  St. Peter has some really cool stuff that woulda been good to get.  Oh well :(  Lets see.... We drove down (up?) yesterday after school and stayed in a hotel (we got a fireplace suite because they originally gave us a smoking room *cough*)  Well, first thing in the morning Amy had her audition for the music scholarship there, which involved numerous hours of waiting, sleeping, thinking.  Then we met with Emilie (thats Jenni's sis) and she took Amy away, hehe, so we went and drove around, and thats when I saw a lot of the cool things I wanted to take pictures of, and we ate at a 50s diner, came back, and drove home.  Yup thats about it.  Everyone's been really morbid lately at lunch...  I don't get it.  actually just the ones that are in logan's "sex group."  They never tell me anything.  Could that be because I don't tell them much anymore? maybe I don't know.  I don't know much anymore.  Life is hard to understand.

And then I thought she ruined her chance of me trusting her, cuz she implied that laura wrote "Thea is a sexy beast" in it, when evidently it was Angie... Mofo.  or maybe Mary lied, but I think I trust her enough.  I wrote another poem a few days ago, If i had my journal with me I'd post it.  Maybe later.

Companys here, my grandparents and my cousins and my uncle. wow its 10 already.  I think i'm like 1197 now! 3 freakin away from double hammer!  oh well.  Nobody was on today to play, and besides i didn't play much i had to work more on my eagle speech, which is done now (thankfully) but i still have to present it :(  Confirmation tomorrow too, what great fun... Anyways my verse is anyway, its almost poetic:  "The God we worship can save us from you and your flaming furnace." Daniel 3:17  Hmm thats all for now, later

      hmm lets see today was solo ensemble, i took it easy this year, an trombone choir (A) and a brass choir (B) is all.  I got a 2 on the brass choir, tho it shoulda been a 1, some of the judges used the state grading scale, which is harder.  I mean hey at least you could give better comments if your gunna give us a 2!  jeez raise your music stands? come on.  and probably a 2 on T-Bone party, i think he judged it the same way, but nevertheless the 4ths and 1sts sucked anyway... lol yes I'm the greatest... lol  what else... you'd be surprised at how comfortable bleachers are when you lay down. yeah i got bored waiting for the LATE horns....  Oo and reid made me decide i'm going to toy with the artificial language thing again, this time there being a rule that you can teach it to anyone so long as they're a guy (hence the guy language) so sorry ladies but you'll have to just be content with what we decide to say in english... lol  I finally figured out my signature.  It was inspired a little bit by the tolkien logo, i was cleaning up my room (we have company next weekend) and came across the hobbit and saw it and then thought about the rambaldhi symbol again (it looks like this: &laquo; O &raquo;) and started to draw (and i'm not telling the exact details of how i came up with it :P ) and came up with it and its pretty much imposible to do justice to it with words, but its sortof like an horizontally elongated 8 with a divisor in the middle and the bottom left intersection rounded, as well as a line coming from the vertex of the left segments of the 8, curving downward, then upward and eventually to a dot.  Another dot is just to the right of the vertex of the right segments of the 8 and another above the divisor.  Phew!  You probably have no idea what that looks like, in part because i can't describe it all that well, if you really want to know what it looks like have me draw it, or perhaps i'll scan it sometime

       Mood:  Intrigued   Listening to:  Seal - Kiss from a rose  I don't feel like summarizing the events of the past few days of my not blogging so I'll just post what I wrote in my OpenDiary.  Yes its sortof chating but i don't care.   New front page  3/14/2004   I decided my front page needed some work... so i renevated it.  Yesterday was my eagle (Not eagly mary... lol) ceremony and it was quite fun... I messed up a little on my speech, but everyone said they thought it was really good.  It was quite funny when we got home and I opened all the cards people got me and kept getting more money (as I was expecting; matt warned me) she's like "I could go shopping with all that money!" and I just laughed and asked why I couldn't.  I got a new watch from my parents too, i have to have it fitted soon though, and some silver dollars with eagles on them and a whole bunch of stuff really.  I g2g alex is comin soon.    nobody writes much anymore :(  3/15/2004   It seems like nobody writes much in here anymore... not that i do or ever did but still, cmon guys.  I finnished my planner redecoration today.  The back as of yesterday night had (if you didn't see it today) most of the alias characters along the top, an awesome finding nemo picture below that and homestar on the bottom.  i just finnished the front a few minutes ago.  At the top theres a big picture of jennifer garner (Syd) Eric H. knows how hard my printer tried to make her not look hot... lol Theres another one below it with red hair, the awesome vintage 007 logo i found, and this sign that says "NO TRESPASSING... Items May Explode If Handled.  Removal of Items Projibited Under Penalty of Law."  And yes it's really a real sign, I took a pic of it in OBX (thats outer banks).  then on the back side of that sheet is another big picture, this one of michael vartan (Vaughn) and below that 3 more little ones of JG and one of victor garber (Jack).  Yes I may be insane.  Anyway, I wrote a poem last night I'll have to put up here but I didn't really have much free time today (after the eash project and my decorating) so I couldn't do it today.  Tsch&uuml;&szlig;!  Hey Hey  3/16/2004   Such a descriptive title. :-P  You probabaly know how i always said taht the first 3 trombones were about equal?  well I take it back.  Peter isn't as good as me and katie.  I almost wanted to scream "You see those little things on the edge of the paper? they're called the key signature" to him but i contained myself...  He'd probably be fine if he actually tried or practiced once in a while but since he doesn't....  alors, :P I went in to get my watch sized today.  And nate installed gunbound.  FINALLY... you'd think giving out 8 cds would yield more people who actually use them.... and i didn't give them to people who didn't want them... ah nevermind most of ya probably dont even know what i'm talking about, gunbound.  I suppose I'll put my two most recent poetic endeavors here since nobody reads my blog....  "Shrouding Smoke" The smoke shrouds the arena. Blurs the boundaries and hovers low.  That which was once Black and White, Now is as the greasy gray of the smoke. That which was once Right and Wrong, Now is subject to fiery debate. That which was once obviously clear, Now is confused and distorted.  Those who once stood behind, Now are in the fray. Those who made amends, Now stand high and see. Those who need a vision, Now have eyes shrouded.  The smoke shrouds the arena, And alas, that which was unknown, Unknown remains. -March 15, 2004   "Tower in the Sea" There once was an old gray tower in the Sea, A lone pillar of stone, A solemn sentinel to the profusion. It's smoothly curv&eacute;d walls dissonant With the roughly hewn slabs, Giving wind of the mode within. A blazing glow once emanated from the walk, Unceasingly probing into the Great Deep. Crimson anger flowing from its lodgment, Lightning engaging the clouds skyward. There once was an old gray tower in the Sea. -March 16, 2004 We now come to the end of the day, Goodnight to you, rest you soul.
