      I wrote these yesterday for work but thought you lot might like them too. They're short and sweet as the cards we have to write on are not very big.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      urlLink Lirael by Garth Nix   Lirael returns us to the Old Kingdom fourteen years after the events told in Sabriel. Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, a race of Seers who live within the Glacier. But Lirael has never received the Gift of Sight and so she spends her time working and hiding in the Great Library where she can learn more Charter Magic. When she is sent on a quest to find a boy named Nicholas, she meets up with Prince Sameth and her whole world changes overnight. A fantastic return to the world first introduced in Sabriel.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      urlLink Abhorsen by Garth Nix   In Abhorsen we return to the story of Prince Sameth and Lirael. They are both still reeling from the discovery of their true destinies, Sam as a Wallmaker, and Lirael as The-Abhorsen-In-Waiting. The race to the Red Lake is becoming more desperate every day, and with the news of Sabriel and Touchstone's murders still ringing in their ears, Lirael and Sam must fight their way through many Dead to reach their destination. The finale to The Old Kingdom Trilogy is tense and exciting. Very highly recommended.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      urlLink Paradise Fields by Katie Fforde   Nel is pleasantly surprised by a kiss from a handsome stranger at the Christmas Farmers Market. Her excuse to her friends is that she was selling mistletoe at the time, but this doesn't explain why she gets so flustered every time she thinks of him. But when the hospices playing fields are threatened, and her handsome stranger turns out to be the solicitor for the enemy, Nel must fight with strength she never knew she had. Katie Fforde's latest bestseller is an absolutely glorious tale of love, life and community spirit.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      urlLink A Hat Full of Sky by Terry Pratchett   Tiffany Aching is leaving home to be apprenticed to Miss Level, a witch who lives in the mountain country and sometimes leaves her glasses on her other nose. Tiffany is so busy trying to get used to being surrounded by trees, and to be accepted by the other apprentice witches (one of whom prefers Magick to magic) that she doesn't realise she is being hunted by a Hiver, a magical creature from the beginnings of Time. Luckily Rob Any Body, Daft Wullie and the rest of the Nac Mac Feegle clan are on their way to help out, along with a certain Mistress Weatherwax. As with all DiscWorld books, highly recommended.

      I read  urlLink 'A Hat Full of Sky'  by Terry Pratchett on Friday.  I finished the proof for  urlLink '....And That's When It Fell Off In My Hand'  by Louise Rennison yesterday.  I am currently reading the proof of  urlLink 'The Shadow of the Wind'  by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. Although when I say currently reading, I have about 20 pages left which I am going to read in bed when I have caught up on the WitchGrove.  I wrote a few reviews at work today but don't have time to type them in now, I'll try to add at least one of them in the morning.

      Ok, so this time Mab gave me the idea for this, although I've been toying with it for a while.  This blog will tell you what I have been reading, and might even give you a review sometimes!

       urlLink 'Darwin's Children' by Greg Bear . It was pretty good, scary in places. I borrowed it from the library after it caught my attention at work.  I also borrowed  urlLink 'Ogg' by Bob Jones  (which I managed 40 pages of before giving up on), and  urlLink 'The Briar King' by Greg Keyes  (which I managed 23 pages of before deciding I really wasn't in the mood!).    I am currently re-reading  urlLink 'Sabriel' by Garth Nix  (a hardcover link because I own the hardcover and like that cover more) so that I can add its review on here to go with the other two.  I think I'm going to do some tatting with the links and add the pictures in here too.

      This update was brought about by Anna from WG who sent me an email asking for book recommendations and mentioned that the last post didn't say if I liked the books! Oops!  &nbsp;  Anna: I liked the books a lot.  &nbsp;  Another book I liked a lot is  urlLink The Death and Life of Charlie St Cloud . Contrary to the Amazon review I found that it did make me think about what happens after death, plus, who looks for "serious answers" about death in a novel???  &nbsp;  I'm still wading my way through the  urlLink Lone Pine  series, I have four left to go.  &nbsp;  I've also read&nbsp; urlLink Wine of Angels &nbsp;by Phil Rickman. Mab recommended these to me and I got most of them from the library. Now I just need to text her to ask if I can borrow the second one, as that's the one the library didn't have.  &nbsp;  I read most of  urlLink The Looking Glass Wars  in the bath yesterday (I get proof copies from work all the time). I'm about 50 pages from the end and so far it's pretty good. It's supposed to be the start of a trilogy so I'll have to wait til the end to see how it goes.  &nbsp;  That's about it for now. I'm expecting an invasion of Wulfrun Moot people soon so had better get my "bottom out of&nbsp;that pc chair&nbsp;and come shopping" as Phoenix just said to me. Lovely boy....  &nbsp;

      Ok, I know, I'm pants at updating this blog. I just have been sooo busy and it's intensive putting stuff on here!   Anyways, I'm currently reading the  urlLink Lone Pine  series of books by Malcolm Saville. They're mostly set in Shropshire and I've just read one of them (The Secret of Grey Walls) that is set in Clun, where we visited on the pagan camping trip. I'm missing two: Strangers at Witchend (which I read years ago) and Where's My Girl? (which I have never read.) Certainly the second one is pretty rare to get hold of, even more so because I'm deliberately trying to collect the Armada editions. I'm not sure about that Flower Show book that is listed at the end, I don't know anything about it and I've only just seen it listed on that site.   As well as those I also read a few (just a few) books on holiday. Some of these were:    urlLink The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency ,   urlLink The Probable Future ,   urlLink Black Maria ,   urlLink Castle In The Air ,   urlLink Here On Earth .   I made a trip to the library the other day and returned home with a bagful of Phil Rickman and Alice Hoffman books. But haven't started any of them yet as I'm soul deep in the Lone Pine books!   Oh well, I have a day off tomorrow so will try to finish the Lone Pine series then so I can start on the Phil Rickman.

						   Well it's now 2.06am and I'm still not sleepy!  The good folks at WitchGrove have given me lots of advice and (apart from the "watch golf programmes" thing) I am heeding it.  Stitch and I are off to bed, to curl up and read until we doze off. Much more sleep inducing than Blackadder.

						   Well as I have this horrible fluey coldy thing and can't sleep I've been wandering through the Web and decided I might as well get myself a bloggy thing.  I might even post on it occassionally!  Yuck, nose is running.  Need more tissues, more Lemsip and another Mars Bar Icecream!

						   I actually got up before eleven this morning. That's practically unheard of for a saturday when I don't have to go out or do anything. But my back hurt and I thought I can always have a nap this afternoon.  I don't have to worry about throwing my sleep pattern out because I have a whole week off now! Yippee! No more work until Monday February 9th!  I'm going to do some more tidying, organise my books, do some work on my website, research into a few herbs and look for a new house. So I'm not exactly going to be lying around!

						   Sorta got the budget sorted last night, but got so stressed about one bit of it I ended up throwing up. Woke up this morning with the answer in my brain!  Tonight is much more relaxing... I'm just trying to get caught up with WitchGrove again and then shall watch Angel.

						   Well I tried doing that budget....  ...and I've given up.  I can make one based on my income. I can make one based on mine and Phoenixs income. But I can't make one of half the bills based on my income because the numbers stop making sense.  I threw several things across the room, used up about 500 bits of paper and got myslef so wound up I was nearly sick. So I stopped.  I shall try again tomorrow when Phoenix is here to help me make the numbers behave.  Oh, and Mabs a total darling!

						   I had two things I had to do today, tidy the living room and draw up a budget to send to the courts. Since I only just finished tidying the living room, I may well leave that nasty budget til tomorrow-but at least I now know where all the paperwork is that I'll need, and the floor is clear for me to spead myself out on. Think I'll go grab some food, watch "Angel", snuggle with my man, and maybe do some budgeting-depends what else is on tv.

						   Today I have been mostly....recovering after my first week back at work after that horrible flu. I've been "tatting" with my  urlLink website , and reading all the messages on the WitchGrove. I also tidied the living room (shock horror)  and  did some washing too! I'm at work all next week...but will have the weekend off for once so can recover. Just have to wait for payday now....roll on the 20th!

						   Off work sick  again  today. Managed to struggle in yesterday but got sent home at half-one, just in time to suffer through the Sound of Music on TV. (Suffer, who am I kidding, I love that film).  Have spent most of today asleep, properly asleep, going upstairs to cuddle up with Phoenix asleep, as opposed to the curled up on futon dozing while the tv is on asleep that we've been taking it in turns to do since Monday.  Now I just have to try eating some solid food....

						   and it's going to be a busy one!  No that I've caught up with the Grove again I'm going to go tidy the living room and start doing some packing.  The living room seems to end up full of dirty clothes (as we tend to get dressed and undressed downstairs and then hurtle upstairs to bed in our nightwear already, as downstairs is WARM!) so the ones we need I shall wash and the rest will get "packed" into black bags so they can be washed when we get our new house with a washing machine!  Let's go see what Phoenix is doing.....

						   Triggered by the weekly discussion topic of Funerals and Farewells, people on the Grove have been posting their obituaries. Not cos they're going to die soon, but as an exercise in self-appreciation (guess which Mab thought up that bit).  I can't write my own obituary tonight, not enough ideas (so if anything happens to me tomorrow you'll just have to use bits from here).  I have my CDF meeting tomorrow to see how work is going and where I am going at work. I never know what to say at these things, and when I think of something it never seems to come out right. *sigh* It'll all get sorted I'm sure!  I spent the time while watching Charmed (I know who/what Wyatt is!!!!!) flickiung through the Argos catalogue and circling home stuff. I'm having severe nesting tendancies at the moment, very scary. Campbell keeps asking if there's something I'm not telling her, but I know I'm not pregnant so there isn't. (Ok, Sarah?)  I'm going to head off to bed now, then I can attempt to get up early and be all grounded and awake for my CDF.....better wear that lump of haematite again!  Oh! I have email!  I don't think I'm going to bed after all!

						   Well I took them the £100 and they're holding the house for us!  WOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO!  I was sooo hyper all day at work, until about 5 when the energy just ran out and I was behind the counter in a small sad heap.  I've been writing lists of all the things we need for the house; waste-paper baskets, plate racks, bookshelves..... Phoenix just smiles sweetly and ignores me.  I know we can't afford to buy it all in one big go, but I plan to just get  one thing a month or so (about £25 a month we can spare) so that it gets more comfy.   Starting with hanging rails (no wardrobes) and working up to a sofa, going past computer desks and bookcases (lots of them) on the way.  Not to mention all the parties.......house-warming for everyone, Pagan gatherings, Wrestling weekends.........  I'm off to bed now as the caffeine is wearing off and Phoenix is already up there.

						   I have had a lovely day off!  I had a lovely long chat with Audrey about all sorts of things. She reassured me about the new house I liked and then offered me all sorts of help and advice. I really had a great time! Then I came home to find she's bigged me up on WitchGrove too!  Richard picked up Lilo and Stitch for me (although I didn't get time to watch it), and I found  urlLink Blackberry Wine  in a charity shop for £1.99.  Mum has been wonderful and transferred over the money for reserving the new place, I have to go see them tomorrow to make sure we get it.  The house was gorgeous. It has new laminate flooring throughout and although it's probably only about the same size as this house it seems so much bigger  with the light floors and walls. The kitchen was lovely, and the bathroom warm (and the bath looked comfortably big enough for two).  The drawback is it's £395 a month, but we'll probably save that much on heating and on "cheering Kate up" purchases.  I shall go take the forms to them tomorrow and the hopefully we can start the ball rolling!  Going to bed now as this has been a very very long day (as you can tell from the numerous posts!)

						   BS Kate was great yesterday - bookshop woman of the year! I was rushing to meet a train, when it occurred to me that there was going to be one of those embarrassing moments where our visitor produced presents and I hadn't got mine for her yet. I'd already decided that it was going to be a book of old photographs of Walsall, I just hadn't had chance to go and get it. But the train was delayed, so I had about 20 mins to get into the city, get into Waterstones, buy it, hide it and get to the station.  I only knew Waterstones was open on a Sunday because of BS Kate's blog!  So I pulled up outside, raced through the doors and spotted Kate immediately, "Kate! Kate! I need an emergency book of Walsall in old pictures!" "You need a...?" "Book of Walsall in old pictures, urgently!"  So the unflappable Kate ran around to the local history shelves, found one and we were running to the till when she said, "Oh! We've got a new Syd Barrett book in..." "I need that as well!" "Piper at the Gates of..." "I need it! It's mine!"  So we ran to the Syd Barrett shelf (they might call it something else...) and grabbed that book, then legged it to the till again.  Now that's what I call a Bookshop Kate. She knows her audience. *grin*  Lenny loved the Walsall book, btw, and I love the Syd book. Thanks for rising to the occasion like that, cariad! yours  Mab xxxxx

I'm about to download a Stitch screensaver too, so everything is very Stitchy today.  Right then: pizza, set the video, pick up the Charmed video for Audrey and a notebook so I can draw plans of the new house.

						   Day off tomorrow!  But I just found out on Witch Grove that Audrey will be coming into Wolverhampton and I might miss her! But hopefully I can find her and hand over some essential witchy viewing....or the new series of Charmed.  Laura honey, don't panic! You can still borrow the tape! But since your video player is sick I though Audrey could borrow it first.  Mab posted her side of the emergency Walsall conversation on the Grove, and as soon as I get permission I shall post it on here, as she's very nice and it will be a thing to read when I've had lots of customers tell me I'm pants. I can read Mabs bit and realise I'm not really, just not a miracle worker and if the new Patricia Cornwell/Ian Rankin/Robin Hobb/Reginald Hill book isn't out in paperback for another six months, it's not my personal fault, no matter what the customer thinks!  In fact a lady today asked when the Patricia Cornwell one (Blowfly) was due and when I told her she turned to her husband and said "I told you it was no good asking in here. I said that they were no good, let's go and buy the paperback from Beatties as they're a proper bookshop and will have it in stock instead of making silly excuses".  I couldn't say ANYTHING as I was choking.....  Now I can say Stupid &^%£%$ *&^^%£$£"_ (&^^%^£ *(&^%&$ Cow!  *rage passing*  Phoenix wants the PC so I'll go finish my book.  urlLink Finding Cassie Crazy   A good book, but I keep seeing the male characters as the boys from Busted!

						   I didn't watch the wrestling in the end, I watched MissMatch instead.  It's Alicia Silverstone working for her daddys law firm as a divorce lawyer by day, and match-making by night.  Basically it shows you what Cher from Clueless did next, except the sexy step-brother/boyfriend has run off to marry Phoebe in Friends.  It's entertainment for me, and something that I watch while he gets the pc for Phoenix.  The mad people of Witch Grove (Colette started it) have been taking the  urlLink Yankee/Dixie Test .  I scored:  63% (Dixie). A definitive Southern score!   That means I get to join Georgia and Cabochon in the Southern Belles corner. A nice comfy sofa and a glass of cool lemonade........and probably a few TDT's too!  (Note to non-Grovers: TDT means Tasty Druid Treat, or any suitable man in a kilt)  On that note, I think I'll see if my TVT (Tasty Viking Treat) wants to go to bed yet.....  and yes Mab, one day you can be a goddess-mother!

						   I've done a bit more tatting because I didn't like the colours I'd chosen when very tired.  Work today was steady, no huge numbers of customers. Humour and Crime are now nice and tidy and alphabetized until 9.05 Monday when some illiterate pillock will pull off a book, look at the back and then lie it down on top of the shelf so that it can fall down the back.  Mab came in today. She really scared me cos she came in and went "Kate! It's an emergency!"  Then she added "I need a book about Walsall". Possibly the first time ever that anyone has needed a book about Walsall and made it an "emergency".  I also forgot and mentioned we had a new Pink Floyd book so naturally she bought it, despite being skint!  I think I'm going to go and watch some wrestling while I eat my tea.

						   I had Tuesday off and worked today then I'm working tomorrow and have Tuesday off again....this means I'll work Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday....  I wish the rotas could be juggled again to make sure no-one has to do six days in a row, I'm not the only one who has to, I know Maggie does too.  Ah well, best to just get on with it and enjoy the fact that I then only have three days of work before a weekend off!  Phoenix didn't get to view that house today as when he phoned to confirm it had already been let  :(  Michael came in again today and said to text him about Phoenix viewing it, but haven't heard back from him yet.  I hope we get something sorted soon....it's two weeks on Tuesday until the planned moving day and there's no other days I can get off work!  Just got an instant message from James, the guy I lived with in Canterbury for about a year. It feels like such a long time since I was there, but it's only three years....in fact....it was three years on Tuesday......  Gosh I feel old.  I'd better go tape Angel and Smackdown and see if I can persuade that lovely man to come to bed.......... ;)

						   Ok so a customer got grumpy with me because I didn't know Amazons phone number *hello! Phone number??????* and then told me I was "useless". Silly old prat!  But!  1) The Severn Trent Trust Fund are covering our water bill.  2) Capital One want £1 a month till Jan 2005 and will then "review" the debt. All charges are frozen till then.  3) I got a proof of a book I thought mum would like yesterday, called  urlLink Home: The Story of Everyone Who Ever Lived in Our House    4) I got the new Katie Fforde proof too!  urlLink Restoring Grace   5) While I was just finding that link I discovered there's a new Christina Jones book out too!  urlLink Hubble Bubble . And the title sounds *witchy*!  Tomorrow I shall pay the council £250, buy Phoenix a book called  urlLink Vikings , and buy myself  urlLink Dime Store Magic .  I'd better head off to bed soon, I have a man to cuddle....  OH!!!!!  Cerr is having a BOY!!!!! Congratulations darling!  (and I voted "boy" on the Witch Grove poll!)

						   It  *only* took me 90 minutes to catch up on the Witch Grove, chatty folks!  Now I'm off for a nice relaxing bath as all my muscles ache!  Lush product in bath: Hot Toddy Bubble Bar.  Book being read: 362 Belisle Street by Susie Moloney.

						   Had another day off today.  I caught up on all the programmes I had taped (except No Way Out) and downloaded a couple of free budgeting programs.  I also spoke to the nice people at the CCCS again. They're sending me some info on their debt management plan, and as soon as we pay the council next Wednesday I shall get signed up to it. Jonathan reckoned it would take us about three years to pay off the £6,000 we owe, so we have a figure and date to aim for now.  Now I'm just trying to catch up with the Witch Grove before I head to bed!

						   We went to the Gifford on Friday and spent a few hours getting tipsy with some very nice people, then Saturday we went shopping for assorted Valentines gifts.  After a wander around the shops together, pointing out all the things we liked we split up and went to spend our £14.50 each.  He got a pill-box with cats on, an inflatable blue yeti, an amulet keyring, a small viking and some incense.  I got two red roses (and assorted blue flowers) some incense, a gorgeous haematite chunk (on a lace for use as a necklace) and the leather notebook I'd been craving!  I haven't written in it yet, plan to tomorrow. It's going to be filled with quotes, song lyrics and poetry.  I also decorated my new BOS folder. It now has silver filigree butterflies, some gold/jewel wrapping paper (looks like a turkish/arabian mosaic). a foiled faerie card and a cat card on it. I was in the process of adding gorgeous pictures from the  urlLink Lush Times  to it when I ran out of glue.  But I get paid on Friday so can get more glue and another notebook for work then.

						   Today (and the last few days) I have been tatting with my website and hanging out on WitchGrove.  I haven't done anything exciting this week, but then this week was all about getting myself centered and happy. Apart from the news about Carlie Brucia making me cry for about two hours straight, I have been mostly happy and getting hints from the faeries about where to head next.  Plus, now the editing page has changed I've managed to put myself in the UK, rather than the US, and I now speak English (United Kingdom) as opposed to English (American).

						   I just took the  urlLink Death Test   Mark your calendar or Palm V. You can expect to die on:   April 15, 2058  at the age of 79 years old.    On that date you will most likely die from:   Cancer (45%) Alien Abduction (13%) Homicide (9%) Third Degree Burns (6%)   Interesting stats from the DeathTest:   -15897189 people have taken the DeathTest.  -Of those, 55% were female and 45% were male.   -The average life expectancy of test takers is 67 years.   -10% of test takers have hairy nipples.   -4% have had team sex.   -8% work in the porn business.  -And 325355 people claim to have leprosy.     Disclaimer: We, despite being proficient with the human anatomy, are not doctors. Keep that in mind before calling your lawyer as you're clutching your left arm moaning "Damn you, Spark, Damn YOU!" on April 15, 2058, as you slip silently into the night.  So that's it then...I'll head off the day before Phoenix's 77th birthday. And I wanted to make it to the year 2066 too, if only to see the celebrations of 1000 years since the Norman Conquest.  Oh well, at least I'm more likely to be abducted by aliens than murdered.

						   The main thing I have to say about last night is WOW!  Yeah I was nervous at first, especially when it got to 7.45 and no-one had shown up (for a 6ish start, timed for work folks, none of whom came), but then Mandy and Jennie and Jennies German friend (whose name I've forgotten, but she's on the Grove) and her man (Philip I think, and I'm assuming he was her man from the way he teased her) turned up at about 8 and got the party started!  Then Laura appeared, and Steve and Jason, and Robbie, and Mab and FT Kate and last but by no means least, Jamie turned up at half past midnight!  I did a few house tours and Jennie and Mandy treated us to impressions of a dead mouse with no eyes and some very scared fish respectively (I'm not even going to TRY to explain!).  Errrmmmm.....  A few of us did a Blot in the back yard too. Laura poured beer down herself, Mandy boasted she gave the best blow-jobs in Wolverhampton (and FT Kate boasted SHE gave the best ones in Dudley). Also, Mab boasted! She boasted lots! (and so she should). This means that there are witnesses to the fact she finally said she was great!  Then Laura dictated a post to Witchgrove which Mab obligingly typed for her, and which convinced everyone on the Grove that we were all plastered! (It was the Potcheen fumes wasn't it? they crept through the phone line!)  Then we watched a little Black Books before Mab and FT Kate left at 1.05am. This promptly became 2.05am because of the clock change and most folks moved into the kitchen to write things on the cooker using our Erotic Magnetic Poetry Set. (I will write them all down for inclusion in here at a later date).  I gave up and went to bed at 3.30, leaving most in the kitchen and Laura passed out on the futon (she did only have three glasses of wine.....but the glass did hold a whole bottle!)  When I got up at 9.30ish Mandy was cleaning! She was impressed at the fact we'd had such a tidy party, even with three Heathens there.  Jamie left at 10.30, to go back to work! I'm very impressed with that young lady, she came and stayed (and bought me a totally gorgeous photo frame to boot) and wrote rude things on my cooker. She can come again!  Errrmmm....  Last folks (Jason and Steve) left at 1.30pm leaving me to watch Lilo and Stitch at last (hadnt seen it before) and burst into floods of tears at the film because after the party I suddenly felt really lonely.  So Phoenix cheered me up and I toddled off to bed for another few hours.  Now I have to go watch wrestling with my very sexy man.  Later!

						   Well I sorted Whitegates. The money is being transferred back tomorrow and they apologised about the whole axe murderer thing.  I bet they wouldn't have given the money back if I hadn't gone it and kicked up a stink though. cynical me!  I manged to reply to Georgina today, wow! At last! I changed the subject line to "I am such a useless slut" because when it comes to not answering emails, I am a useless slut.  Tonight I have caught up on Witchgrove, I have meatballs and rice for dinner and I'm going to work on Pami's wedding pressie (the Blessed Be design on the front of this  urlLink book  ) while watching Grand Designs and Miss Match.  Oh, and it's a pagany type house on Grand Designs this week. It;s one I've seen before but the guy impressed me soooo much!  Ok, must go eat meatballs....

"Hello Whitegates people, why are you so shit???? You arrange a viewing of my house (well it still was then) and don't turn up to show the viewers around, so there was me and three Italian guys who could have been freaky axe murderers, and you've stolen £300 from my account to pay rent on a house I no longer live in!!!!!!"

						   (copied from WitchGrove, because I'm really mad about this)  I would like to start this message by saying:  "THANK YOU PIXIE!!!!!! You're a lovely, lovely lady!"  She sent me some rather cute candles and incense!  However....my other parcels are still in limbo :(  To recap:  When we came round to the house on moving day (Sat 13th) we found a card telling us that a parcel could not be delivered. I phoned to get this parcel redelivered on the Tuesday.  They didn't redeliver on the Tuesday so I phoned again to get it delivered on the Saturday (20th).  Then on the Wednesday I had another card saying I had a parcel to be delivered, I phoned and asked them to deliver that on the Saturday (20th) as well.  Saturday (20th) morning I came downstairs at 7.30, and spotted a card on the doormat.  The card was a "could not be delivered" card, the time on it was 8.00 and the date....the 21st. So I stood there with the card teling me that in 24 1/2 hours they couldn't deliver my parcels, and I laughed.  I phoned the Post Office AGAIN and explained to the man that I was a little bit miffed! Arranged to have the parcels delivered today, Tuesday (23rd).  Last night we came home to ANOTHER card, this one stating that a parcel had been left next door for us. But no-one answered next door so we left it till today.  This morning I collected Pixies wonderous parcel from the nice lady next door and then settled down to wait for the postman and my other one or two parcels.  I got fed up at 11.45 and phoned them again.....THE PARCELS ARE STILL AT THE OFFICE!!!!!!!!!   AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!  I asked the man why and he said it was because they'd already tried to deliver them twice. I explained that if I phone and say that the only day we'll be there is a Tuesday (for example), delivering them on the Monday WON'T WORK!!!!!!  *deep breaths*  So, my parcel(s) (because I don't know how many I'm expecting) are going to be delivered on Saturday....two weeks late! (They only hold the items for three weeks before they return them to sender).  Could people please send a little "get yourselves f**king sorted!" energy to my ridiculously bad-at-his-job postman (who also delivers pizza leaflets, which I'm pretty sure he's not supposed to do).  This has been a Bookshop Kate rant.  Normal service will be resumed when I have done a "condition report" with the letting agent and can at last go out and buy myself some breakfast (as I was waiting in for the postman......)  Bookshop Kate, craving pizza!

						   Ok then, this is a post about a party, well two actually.  Phoenix and I are having two house-warming parties, one next Saturday (the 27th March) and one on my next weekend off after that (Saturday 24th April).  Both will start at about 6pmish and will finish when we throw you all out, if you need to crash then bring your own sleeping bag and we will reserve you a bit of floor.  You will need to bring your own alcohol, but we will have some crisps and stuff for you to snack on (and Aud might do you a baked potato if you're nice).  Our new address is:  37 Burleigh Road Wolverhampton UK (for you US Grovers who haven't worked out I'm a UK bunny yet)  I'm in the process of getting a map put on my website if you need to find us, there is bugger-all parking in this road so you may need to park in another road if you're driving (which you shouldn't be if you're drinking ok!)  If you need directions, want to check you're allowed to attend both (yes you are Aud), or want to confirm the time your chartered WitchGrove jet is arriving then please email kholmden@ hotmail.com (lose the space obviously) or ring my mobile 07963744222 and I will listen to you politely.  This has been a Bookshop Kate customer service announcement!

						   BS Kate:  **Thank you for saying I'm wise and lovely, but I wouldn't say the WPS revolves around me! I'm just an easy target!**  Tis true. If you think on it, who is the common link here? Singe might run the Moot and I might moderate Witchgrove, but that's where it ends. You're a prominent Pagan in W-ton city centre, who is easily approachable through your job. Under your counter acts as a drop-off centre for everyone else. Need to get a book to Laura? Put it under Kate's counter and tell her it's there. Need to get in touch with Magenta? 'Phone Kate and ask for help. Need to tell the Grove that Mab's been injured, text Kate and she'll alert Cabochon.  You're the centre of operations, cariad fi, and every Wulfrunian Grover has your number, even if it's just the work one. It's in the Yellow Pages.  yours Mab xxxxx

And everyone knows that the Wolverhampton Pagan Scene revolves around BS Kate, so we're just lucky that she's wise and lovely. And you will be Vegas's answer to her!"  At least someone thinks I'm wise and lovely! (although I'd hardly say the WPS revolves around me, I think it revolves around her!)  I shall keep this on my screen thingy to remind me when I get down.

						   But I have been moving house!  The new house is lovely. There is something that mostly hangs out in the back room upstairs (that will be our quiet room) that seems lovely and friendly and I've stopped jumping at odd noises.  I still haven't posted about the funeral have I. I'm still mulling it all over in my head I guess.  But I've had two emails from Georgina! Her emails could be written by Emily, same phrasing and spelling! It's nice to be getting to know bits of my family, I had an invite to Richards wedding reception arrive yesterday, I now have to RSVP to it so will be looking through books tomorrow for the "proper" way to reply. I also have to RSVP to Pami!  I promise to write more tomorrow, especially since I nag Cabochon about his blog and then don't write in here myself!  Tomorrow is changeover day at work so will be there late, and then have to get the house ready for viewings on Thursday!  Must remember to phone the post office too, I have two parcels waiting there for me and I can't get them til Saturday....I wonder what they are!  Ok, must go sleeeeeeeeep  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

						   I know all those folks on WitchGrove are waiting to read about my Tuesday, but I'm just too tired to think, let alone type, so you'll have to wait til tomorrow.  It went much better than I thought it would though, despite my attack of nerves and paranoia which meant I only got up the courage to try to talk to my cousin Georgina (who I'd never met before) when mum said we had to get going.  But she asked if she could have my email from Richard, and when he emailed earlier he said he'd passed it along so I'll have to keep checking my Junk Mail folder so that it doesn't get munched by MSN (as Cerr's mail nearly did earlier).  Ok, work tomorrow, and packing, and trying to finish catching up on the WitchGrove, and Charmed is on TV and so is the new series of Black Books......  Going to bed....

						   Well I'm at home again.....and have about ten minutes before we head off to Southend (pronounced Saaaaarrrfffffennnnd) for my Nana's funeral.  The coach journey down was ok, couldn't read as it made me queasy but slept a bit and did a little cross-stitch.  Home is the same yet different. Things are in the same places mostly, but the subtle changes that happen every week seem like big changes when you've been away for two months. The new TV is big and shiny and Emily worships it as it gets Kerrang! radio.  Did a very small blot to Thor last night as a thankyou for looking after me on Sunday. He got 1/3 of a bottle of Tiger and I got a few raindrops so I guess he was listening.  Better get ready to head out!

						   I have had SUCH a hectic couple of days!  Saturday - Work was ok. I was upstairs all day :(  but Laura and her gorgeous lad Brendan came in to visit me! Laura bought The Dark Is Rising, and Brendan had his face painted, then I wandered with them to Boots and we all bought chocolate orgasms (GU Mini-Puds are their other name). I don't know what they thought of them as I had to scoot back to work! The Busted gig was fantastic! Campbell and I danced a little and sang along a lot, and then got to sit in first class on the journey home (very comfy seats). Then when I'd got home (Phoenix came and met me from the station at midnight, isn't he lovely) I attempted to watch the Grand Prix. I managed the first half hour then dropped off to sleep at 3.30am. I woke up just in time to see Michael Schumacher win it and then crawled up the stairs to bed.  Sunday - I'd set the alarm for 9, but just hit it repeatedly until it shut up and then dozed off again. Aud's text message woke us at 9.30 and we managed to get up and ready in time for them to pick us up at 10.30.  On the way to the reenactors market we'd meant to ask Alan if we could stop at a cashpoint, but forgot. So when we got there we thought we'd wander off and find one....... A woman gave us vague directions to a garage she said had one ("15 minutes walk just down there"), and 30 minutes later we were on the wrong side of a very busy A-road to the garage. Phoenix went across the carridgeway while I stood by the side of the road crying, convinced he wasn't going to make it. He came back about 15 minutes later to say that the garage didn't have a cash-point and the garage owner recommended going to Sainsburys..... 4 miles away! This is when we phoned Aud and asked if we could have a lift!  *If you read her blog you'll notice she says she nearly lost us, not her fault, OURS!!!!!*  Alan took us about another mile where we found a garage with a cash point and got the money! We went back to the reenactors market (Aud and Alan didn't come back in, they went shopping for food instead, which made me feel sooo guilty for holding them up) and we could afford to get in!!!!!  After wandering around all the stalls (except the ones selling books as I knew I couldn't risk it) and dribbling over various dresses and pointy things, I purchased a bottle of green ink, two silver buttons (for the Grove thingummy that teri is making), some beer for dad, and a sheepskin! The beer and ink were £2 each and the sheepskin was £10 and I feel very worth the money.  Then we went for a bacon sarnie and a pint and met Andy and Karen (from the Wolves Moot), a couple of their friends (whose names I missed, but the guy was responsible for Andy and Karens gorgeous barbecue cooking thingy - see the pagan camping photos on my site), and Aud and Alan. Discussion covered mad cats and my chocolate "issues".  Then Alan drove us home (and I fell asleep).  We've taken a couple of boxes around to the new place and told my mother the bus times for tomorrow....Oh! I mean today.  I'd better finish reading the Grove and get myself to bed!  Audrey - you're a darling lovely lady and NOT responsible for losing us! At 25 I am perfectly capable of taking responsibility for losing myself!

						   After Cabochon and Mab posted their IQ results I went to have a look at that site.  I took the career test and it said:  Kate, based on your responses, your top career area is Writing and Journalism   Careers in this field often demand that you possess exceptional verbal and written communication skills. You have a natural talent for articulating a message in a way that resonates with other people. Writers and Journalists not only understand and appreciate the power of the written word, but are able to harness that power and use it in their own unique way. Most likely, you enjoy sharing your opinion and perspective with others.    Gosh!  I never expected that! ROTFLMAO!

						   ....often shows itself in strange and mysterious ways.  Today I put MTV Hits on while I was finishing getting dressed before nipping online before leaving for work.   The Sugababes new song was on so I sat and watched and enjoyed.  That finished so I came in here and turned on the pc.  Popped back in there to pick up Wynn and the new Blink 182 song was on, so I sat and watched and enjoyed....  ....the third song to come on was......  Peter Sodding Andre!  I now have Busted on loudly so as to get that pointless tune out of my head and realise that the universe simply won't let me watch MTV Hits when I have WitchGrove to read.

						   My nanna died today.  I'm not quite sure about how to feel about this, after all I hadn't seen her for 18 years and she'd contributed so much to dad being ill.  But I think in the end.....I just feel sorry that she never got to know us. She's the one who missed out on so much, and I think that's a shame.  The Grove folks are being lovely and I can feel energy flowing from all over the place. I'm diverting it off to my family as a whole. My dad who needs it most, my mum and sister who have to deal with dad when he is feeling down; my cousins, especially Richard; and my aunts, who I don't even vaguely remember but can probably use the boost.  I think I shall wend my way to bed, I have a sexy warm man waiting for me and a day off tomorrow.  xxxxxxxxxxx

						   I don't usually admit to this, but my sister is fantastic.  She is smart, funny and drop dead gorgeous. She has great taste in music and clothes (unlike me) and slightly dodgy taste in men (just like me).  Basically she's fab.   I'll miss you when you're in Canada baby sister. You'll have to update your blog lots so I can keep an eye on you!  Emily Ruth Holmden, you're the best little (little? she's taller than me!) sister in the world.  Her blog is over there ----------->    (BTW, this was brought on by the fact that she got me a Tyrannian Harris on NeoPets. If you don't know about NeoPets follow the link and find out.

						    Silly Meme  Invent a memory of me and post it in the comments. It can be anything you want, so long as it's something that's never happened. Then, of course, post this to your journal and see what people would like to remember of you, only the universe failed to cooperate in making it happen so they had to make it up instead.  I like this idea, if I had more time before work I'd post hundreds!

						   Phoenix tells everyone about his "must do something" feeling, and Mab immediately comes up with things for him to do! She's soooooo fantastic!  (Copied from the Grove)  Phoenix:  **For a while now I've felt there's something that needs to be done. Something quite important to me and maybe to you to. 'What needs to be done?' I hear you ask. Well, I dont actually know that. 'How do you know somethings wrong?' you say? I dont really know that either. 'What do you know!?'. If you pick your nose and eat it your hair turns green! Thats it.

						   Well yesterday was mostly lovely!  Work was boring in that long/short way again, until Aud turned up with Harriet and Liam (who are just adorable). Then Mab appeared, and then Laura! Aud took her witchlings home and Mab and Laura went across to the pub to wait for me.  We were in there for about an hour as just the three of us and had some deep and meaningful chats and conflabs while cuddled in the corner. Then lots of people all turned up at once (at least that's what it felt like).  Darling, darling, darling, darling Cabochon turned up first (with a HUGE umberella) and handed us all these little linen bags, each containing a totally gorgeous necklace that he had made in a silversmithing (?) course. Mine is still round my neck now (although it spent the night back in it's bag) and sooooo many people commented on it at work today. Tres gorgeous!  Who else turned up......Phoenix, Mandy, Jennie, Aud and her friend whose name I didn't catch, Steve, Jamie (grinning like a mad thing), Jens friend Carola and her male friend......oh and a friend of Mandys whose name I didn't catch but who said "Mandy said I had to talk to you as you are just the sweetest thing"! (No danger of me going on Mandys list at the moment then!)  Anyway, we all trooped off to the moot and listened to the frozen chicken incident (there wasn't one there actually) and then Mab bought me a book (((lovely Mab))), Aud gave me the stuff she'd got me from Lush plus some extra goodies (((lovely Aud))) and Jennie produced a plastic bag with a goldfish in it (like the one you used to win at fairgrounds)!  This fish managed to scare all the bar staff, and then later lost its plastic bag and went home with Laura! (Fish napper!)  What else.....lots of fun and chats about strange things and the "Galway" man who asked Mab to marry him and Carola showed me the Witchy Tarot set that I've ordered for myself and I took a big list of books to order for people and handed out lots of invites.  (Which reminds me I must get a map up on my website....it'll probably be there by the time you read this, whoever you are).  Then today I was hungover and tired and craving OJ but had no cash for any. Then we discovered that the guys who were fitting the CCTV at work last night not only left dirty mugs all over the shop and the staff room, but when they set off the fire alarm at 4am by burning some toast....it was my bread that they were burning, spread with my butter from the fridge and washed down with my lemon squash and all the milk!  Vicky nearly threw a fit! Since I only had £1 she gave me money from petty cash to buy more bread (so I could have lunch) and wrote a STINKER of an email to the bosses of the guys. They are never coming back to the shop ever again, and another guy brought round a large box of Thorntons chocs from his bosses as an apology.  So that was fun!  Phoenix will be home soon so I shall finish off so he can have the computer.  OH!  Just remembered!  The lovely Fiona was in at work today and in her usual way she was trying to get to me....today it was:  F: "I like that necklace, the yellow really goes with your skin tone" (as in you look ill as she'd said to me earlier)  BSK: "Yeah, Cabochon made it and gave it to me at the Moot last night"  F: "Cabochon" (said in a very kind of condescending tone) "hey. Andy will be getting jealous" (said with a sneer)  BSK: "Wouldn't think so, he knows I only have eyes for him"  F: "Ohhhh, how romantic" (spat instead of spoken)  BSK: "Yeah, well Cabochon might be conducting our wedding so..."  Then I just walked off leaving her muttering away behind me.  BTW Cabochon, that WAS only a might, and Mab was the one that suggested you!  *giggles*

						   Today feels like a long day now I'm sat down and have finished running about, but the day at work went remarkably quickly.  I'm realy quite sleepy and not quite sure what to do with myself at the moment. Should I have a nap for an hour and then not be able to sleep later? or should I have a sleepy relaxed evening, watching TV and sewing and then have a hot bath and a snuggly bed time cuddle with my rather gorgeous man?  I think the second one. I think I've been neglecting him recently, with all the stress and everything bed has just meant sleep for the past month or so....and that's a loooong gap. I think I'll have to work on my seduction techniques for later in the week...better get some more red wine in!  Still, I'm all caught up on WitchGrove and so he can have the computer for almost the whole evening, although I'll need to pop back in there before bed.

						   I'm tired, and ill, and grouchy.  Work this week has just dragged, I've never been able to get everything I've wanted to do done.  Yesterday I had a kids trolley to put out and the OS maps to do. Because of Fionas inability to stay on the shop floor for more than 5 minutes I didn't finish the OS maps, and the kids trolley looks untouched.  Today I think I'm going to end up upstairs lots, which I expect on my Saturdays in, but since Bod is off and Katie W too they will be two people short downstairs so with any luck it'll just be Gemma upstairs and they'll let me come down and play.  Well not play, but help people find books that I know something about.  Ack, late!

						   I've just read a post of WM Mike's on Witchgrove and decided that I need to deal with my problems.  *WARNING* This will be a long post!  I both loved and hated work today. Loved it because we had the changeover to do and we worked like blazes and got it done by 5.30 so we didn't have to stay late. Hated it because I just got crap from F. She wanted to know exactly what I was doing every time she came near me and I keep getting manipulated into doing things by her.  For example: a customer returned a book which we've never stocked before so it needed to be transferred back to the orignal branch. She did the transfer on the screen and put the paperwork in the book and then just left it there. EVERYONE else would have then filled out an address label and then taken the lot upstairs to make Gemma's job easier. But she didn't bother. So I did it, to help Gemma and she comes fast and says "Thanks for doing that." Now I realise she said thanks, which is a start. But I wasn't doing it for her, because I know she wouldn't bother doing it for me, I was doing it for Gemma. The same thing happened a couple more times today, she leaves things half-done, I finish them cause they're driving me crazy then she says thanks for doing that for me, then takes all the credit for doing the job. AAARRRRGGGGHHH!  I just have to block her out. She's obviously playing me, and I want it to stop. I'll get some tips from Mab at the weekend.  Next: Handfasting and camping.  I've been looking forward to this for ages and have kept asking Phoenix to post about it on the Wolves group so everyone knows. He finally did it on Monday and yesterday I get a phone call from Andy asking what's happening. So because Phoenix hadn't squared it with Andy (who organised the whole trip and booked it all etc) our circle of flowers and vows is now going to be vows by the camp fire. This annoyed me, cause Phoenix should have made sure Andy knew first so we could plan it better. Then Andy phoned today cause it got posted to PaganMidlands too and other people answered it.  Now I get why Andy is annoyed about that, I am too because the person concerned has also been bugging me for a while. But I am now feeling that I don't want to go camping because I'll be walking on eggshells the whole time hoping that people are or aren't there and trying to make everyone happy. I want a nice weekend away with my handfasting during it. Not a lot to ask? But it's just all gone pants because of Phoenix not pulling his finger out and messages being posted to places they weren't supposed to be. I want to just sit back and say "You sort it" to Phoenix, but he won't. Then I'll feel like crap and everything will be a mess, whereas if I sort it all then I'll just feel like crap, but not as bad as I would if I'd left it to him.  Brain hurts, life is annoying.  I keep trying to remember what Benji said at the wedding, that people come to Waterstone's to buy books, but that they also come for my knowledge and stuff. I just have to remember that people appreciate me for me and it's not like school anymore. I left 7 years ago for heavens sake, I shouldn't still be feeling so useless and trying to please.  Gah.  Dinners ready. I feel a bit better for all this typing, but part of me is now worrying about what people will think when they read it!  Double Gah!

						   I go around nagging Laura to blog, and then don't do any myself!  I was going to write about the wedding last night, but then Matt phoned to say that Ashley was in surgery for appendicitis (which I've learnt how to spell really fast) and it just slipped my mind.  Ashley is ok, Trish phoned last night to say she should be out in a few days and that she can still go on holiday next week, so that's a relief.  Then Phoenix was playing cards over MSN Messenger with Matt and I joined in and beat him twice.  My early night got lost somewhere....I got to bed at half 1! This goes some way to explaining the groggy look I have today, added to the sore throat/cough thing I now feel quite tired.  Phoenix has a job interview today, I hope he likes the people and gets the job.  Gotta go to work.....roll on the weekend and the Pagan Camping!

						   We head back down south in a few hours. It'll be nice to go back for a few days.  I'm just worried I'll forget something, like the cross-stitch I've worked so hard on for the last couple of months. It's all finished, just need a frame for it, and then wrapping paper. I just hope Pami and Rob like it, I've got the whole paraniod they'll hate it thing playing inside my head.  I kinda dreamt about the wedding last night. I say kinda because I was aware it was the wedding even though I was lost in this strange restaurant. I was walking round a corner when I heard someone talking about me and I stopped to listen. All bad stuff of course, it always is in my dreams when folk are talking about me. But it was just a dream, and anyway, the person who was doing the talking doesn't actually know about any of the stuff they were talking about, so therefore that particular conversation is not possible!  Better go and pack, I must have some wedding suitable clothes somewhere.

						   It's been a really nice sunny weekend in Wolverhampton and the Grove is full of people talking about how lovely their weekend was and how sunburnt they got.  I was at work :( Work wasn't actually that bad, no rude customers, in fact, not that many customers, lots of standing about instead. But I'd sooner have been at home in the sunshine.  My next day off is Wednesday, when we travel back to Essex. Then Thurs I have the dentist, Friday is Pami's wedding, Saturday I think we're going for drinks with my cousin, and Sunday we come back here. Then five days at work (including Thursday out at a school) and then camping! Then I have the Tuesday off (as I'm working the Sat) and it all begins again....  The house is a mess too. I've been so distracted I haven't done any tidying for a while and my small pile of books and sewing has taken over most of the floor. Then this morning I was looking for Phoenix's keys and looked under the futon. BIG mistake. Despite me repeatedly asking him not to take off his socks and kick them under there (or we'll have the situation we had at the other place where he had no clean socks and the futon was off the floor) there are lots of socks there. Plus a jar of piccalilli (sp?), a few plates and a very sharp knife (displays cut on finger).  I know I'm a messy bugger too, but I've asked him sooooo many times not to do this. I've decided I'm not going to do any washing for him until he sorts it himself. If he wants stuff washed he'll have to get used to putting his clothes in a washing pile rather than kicking them under the futon or leaving them all over the bedroom floor (his side of the bed though so I never have to look at the mess).  Tonight I plan to do some cleaning, depending on how today at work goes. If I can shield against F sucking all the energy out of me before she goes home, then I should have enough ooomph to clean and hoover. Then tomorrow I can talk about my love nest and watch her go green...a little bit of subtle revenge is always nice.

						   It occurs to me that while I have been nagging Laura to update her blog more often...I'm not exactly writing reams here myself!  So, what's been happening then....  Well last weekend we stayed at Mabs house and had a lovely time. We talked lots and ate food (cooked by Phoenix) and I read lots of Sandman and then on the way home we took a detour to White Ladies Priory and left when it got too spooky.  This week at work has been....ok. F is back after her two week holiday and although she hasn't deliberately "done" anything to me I still feel crap when I'm round her.  Wednesday I was working upstairs and felt fine, energy levels high, just a bit bored. Then as soon as F came to take the till, I was yawning and falling asleep.  The psoriasis (sp?) on my forehead has come back too. Nothing else has changed, no new skin products, not moisturising any more/less, but F is back and stressing me and so it has returned. It usually only takes a couple of days to vanish though so should be fine in time for next Friday and Pamis wedding.  Eeep! Gonna be late for work!

						   Most of the time I love being me, but there are two days a month I could quite happily skip right past.  Instead of going to the reenactors markety thing I stayed home taking painkillers and spending most of the day curled up in a ball waiting for the tearing pains to fuck right off!  I'm just soo glad it didn't start on Saturday, and I'm also so glad that most of the pain will have gone by tomorrow night so that I can enjoy the moot.  I've read so many things in the past about the fact that women have been brainwashed into thinking periods are dirty and bad. I tend to think this for the first two days and then I quite enjoy the fact that my hormones are up and I feel really feminine, plus the fact that once the pains have died down I don't get anymore for a whole month! Part of the reason I get grouchy before my period is the fact I'm just waiting for the pain to start and dreading it.  Luckily I have a wonderful man who fetches me red wine and hot water bottles and then rubs my back in bed without me having to ask.

						   ...was fabulous!  I had a houseful of people by 8.15am, all excited about the day ahead, especially Magenta who had only found out at 11.40pm that there was room for her too!  We headed off packed into a boys car and a girls (plus Lauras son Brendan) car. The girls car made a quick detour to Waterstones to drop off that art book and then we hit the open road.  This involved lots of singing and cries of "That's where you can see the Tor if it's not this cloudy".  Lunch at the Blue Note was fantastic and we joined up with Juell, Aud and Robbie who'd all got there the night before for the Chalice Well ceremony that morning.  We all fragmented off and wandered into many different shops, getting fairy wishes (involving lots of glitter which ended up all over everyone, including those who make a wish), looking at books and pointy things.  We didn't have much cash so I managed to restrain myself to just a bag of lavender, although if I'd had an empty credit card it would have been filled!  Back to the Blue Note where people came and went from various expeditions and then we headed off up to the Tor.  Parking was a little dodgy as there were no spaces, and then the climb was horrible. I'm usually ok with heights but I had Jen in front who kept saying she was going to fall which made me horribly scared.  At the top we all calmed down and then Mab and Cabochon went off a little way to start their ceremony.  Apart from one prat who hoped "that they're walking widdershins and that's how you're supposed to do it right?" (we glared until he went away), everyone else was really nice and either kept their voices down or watched. It was so obvious that they were focused right inside the circle and the misty day just made the whole thing more fantastic.  They got a round of applause at the end and then we all had mead and watched Brendan running round the hill.  Down the gentle Pilgrims Path to the Chalice well and then the drivers went to get their cars while some of us waited at the bottom listening to the water.  Bottles were filled and then Robbie and Magenta went off home (Aud and Juell went before we went to the Tor as they were both so tired) while we went for dinner at a posh pizzeria.  Brendan nearly fell asleep in his food and darling Cabochon paid for the meal, he's soooo lovely!  Home again, with me attempting to talk to Mab but falling asleep mid conversation and then waking up and trying to continue....  Home just after 2am (to a flashing burglar alarm and a note saying it's been going off randomly recently, can we sort it) and straight to bed.  I got up about 10.30 (and came straight on here) and Phoenix is still asleep, and looking cute.  So I am no longer a Glastonbury Virgin, and managed not to bankrupt myself there either!  Now, where's that shop card I picked up for internet ordering.....

						   ...was an interesting day.  We were short staffed at work so knew things were going to be hectic, but I had no idea just how strange the day was going to be.  I had to serve this guy who wanted "the new Robert Woodward book called Road to War". This didn't come up on the computer at all. I searched under 'war' and 'woodward' and got a guy called 'Bob Woodward' up and asked if this was the right guy.  "Yes, that's the name I said". Nothing by that title came up but I told him that there was a new book, as yet untitled that according to the system was due in June. "Your systems wrong, WHSmiths have got it." After the look on my face evidently radiated puzzlement as to why the hell if Smiths had it was he standing there and yelling at me he added. "But it's in their stockroom and they wouldn't unpack it for me".  (If he talked to the m the way he talked to me I'm not surprised!) Since he was just getting ruder and ruder I said I'd go look upstairs in the politics section. He then followed me saying "If the politics section is upstair you should have a sign saying so" (we have TWO signs saying so!) I found the new Bob Woodward book (published early) and handed it to him. This produced a long rant about the fact the book didn't have the right title. I took him over to Maggie and we went through the whole thing on the system again. Eventually he decided it was right and would buy it, shoving the book into Maggies hands. I popped back downstairs and a minute later he went out, still muttering to himself and without a word of thanks. Then I had to serve a lady who was very rude about the fact she couldn't find any of the books on her list. I looked at the list and had them all in front of her in about a minute (all on the shelves in plain sight, in the right sections). None of them were right though so off she went.  I then said to Richard that I'd love a customer that was polite and nice for a change, and up to the counter came a man called Mr Moses that I'd ordered a book for the other day. He'd been lovely and friendly and polite so I gave him a big smile.  Then he said: "I'm afraid I've got to complain about you."  Richard thought I was going to have a heart attack!  It turned out to be just a joke as he'd heard me wishing for a nice customer. He apologised lots and went off to get his book.  Then Mr Davis came in for his art book and I was about to phone the poublishers and get shirty when Mr Moses came back in with a huge bunch of gorgeous carnations as an apology for scaring me!  So I promptly burst into tears!  I got myself together and phoned the publishers who promised we should have the book with that days Securicor delivery so I asked Mr Davis to come back about 2pm, when Chris would have had a chance to unpack it.  Securicor came, the book didn't.  I phoned the publishers and got shirty again. They rang back about five minutes later to say that as the book was underweight it had gone 1st class post on Tuesday. We'd already opened all the post, no book.  When Mr Davis came back I explained just how the publishers had screwed up and mentioned there was a copy available at the Birmingham High Street store if he could get there. He couldn't and as he needed the book for 9am Sat at the latest I said I would go there after work and pick up the book for him.  So I did.  I eventually got home about 7.30pm and felt great!  Sure I'd had the crap customers that made me want to quit, but they were followed up by a guy who gave me flowers because I was having a pants day, and a guy who is so lovely I was perfectly happy to go the Birmingham after work for him.  Some days I hate my job, but most days I love it.  That's why I sell books.

						   ...Serves me right for going on holiday.  *starts dusting bookshelves*  Oh, sorry did you want me to tell you about it?  *puts down duster, picks up glass of cider*  Well my mum rented a  urlLink rather nice house  in  urlLink Southwold  for a week and asked us to come and stay with her. She sent us the money for the fares and arranged for dad to give us a lift from Billericay station over to Southwold on Saturday afternoon.  Then we spent a nice few days pottering about in the town and wandering along the seafront. We looked at all the beach-huts, played in the arcades and built a brilliant sandcastle on the beach. We also got up for the sunrise on the Monday (I paddled, Emily drank tea and smoked, and Phoenix took some photos (which will be here when they get scanned tomorrow)).  Dad gave us a lift back on Thursday (he stayed at home btw) so that I could go to the dentist and have a lovely big filling and get my jaw stretched so that it hurts lots.  This is only a short post because we are currently still in Essex, in Brentwood at Phoenix's folks to be precise and I still have about 400 messages to read on WitchGrove.  But I thought I'd just put a quick post on so you know what I've been doing, and I'll edit this to be longer and have links and photos when we get back on Sunday.  Love you lots!  *has another swig of cider and a ginger biscuit*

						   Feeling very young and frolicsome tonight.  This might have something to do with the fact that I'm halfway down my second can of Strongbow Super (cider @ 7.5%), but is probably more to do with the fact that I just finished watching Joan of Arcadia again and realised that the programme it soooo reminds me of is My So-Called Life.  Now My So-Called Life only ran for 17 or so episodes before getting cancelled but it was the show that I would watch and think "That's soooo me!". I have almost all the episodes on tape too. It's just the way it makes me feel. It makes me feel young again, well 17 again to be precise.  At 17 I'd stopped wearing glasses, had started bleaching my hair, had stopped getting bullied at school, was in love with a fabulous man....the spring/summer that I was 17 is always sunny in my memory.  That's a good thing too. It's the memory of that summer that kept me going that winter after Jamie had died. The memory of that summer that keeps me thinking "Have to stick around, things in life can be THAT good."  The Pagan camping was mostly like that (until Sunday night when I was stuck back into being 13 again) and so was Glastonbury. Happy times.  Need to go read the Grove, wanna see what all my fabulous folksies are doing!

						   Slept well, no dreams about work!  Feeling bright and chirpy and determined not to let anything or anyone get me down.  Joan of Arcadia to watch tonight, and maybe a film to watch with Phoenix.  The sun is shining, there is a very noisy bird somewhere outside and I have a day off tomorrow!

						   I feel wonky and wrong tonight.  Work today was just about ok, but I can't help wishing I had tomorrow off, I need a break. I know I've only done a four day stint, but that's during my period, covering a weekend and being stuck upstairs where I am slowly dying of boredom.  I've been covering upstairs because M has been on holiday for two weeks. For the first week, G who does 11-4 was on jury duty so it was me by myself. Then last week G was back and I could pop downstairs now and again but I still felt really displaced. G is on holiday this week (including today when I had to go upstairs again) but since M should be back this week, no problem right? Nope, M is ill cos she caught some bug on holiday and won't be in this week. Since Sarah C is off this week it means we are going to be really short staffed. What will happen is that I will be stuck upstairs again, and F will be working downstairs. Phoenix will say to me that I should feel flattered that I'm upstairs as this means that they think I'm good enough to run the whole floor by myself, but I just feel pissed off that I'm stuck up there by myself and someone who knows fuck all about the stock and would sooner be spending 4 hours doing reports in the office gets to go downstairs.  Shit.  Phoenix just came in to say he was going to bed and I completely bit his head off. If I go to bed before him I'm so careful not to phrase it like he has to come too and even though all he just said was "I'm off to bed now" I took it as "I'm going to bed, aren't you coming". So I just went to apologise and explain and he didn't get it, started saying he didn't say anything like that. I know he didn't say that, it's just the way my brain takes things when I'm down and pissed off and feeling like the world is against me.  I'm really tired now and want to go to bed but don't have the strength to either apologise and explain or argue about the fact that my brain is screwed.  I really need some time off or I'm going to go loopy. I want to call in sick tomorrow but since they'll only be 4 people there if I do I will get shot. So tomorrow I will try to get there early and ask Vicky if I can be downstairs as I've got stuff to do down there and that being upstairs is making me feel crap.  I hate this. I hate when my brain chemistry gets fucked up and all I want to do is cry. I hate feeling so fucking helpless and that the whole world hates me. I nearly avoided going on the Grove tonight because my fucked up paranoid brain was telling me that no-one on there really liked me and that I was imagining them being my friends.  Why does my brain chemistry always make it so I'm 13 and my brain becomes one of the bitches who used to bully me.  Need to focus on the fact I'm 25, have a job I (mostly) love, a fabulous man, great online and moot friends and a free holiday coming up in less than a week.  Oh, fuck it.

						   Well everyone on WitchGrove seems to be talking about tarot at the moment, just as I finally bought myself a new set of cards.  I haven't used tarot cards for an awful long time, basically ever since I did that scarily accurate reading for Bubzi and got put right off them. (The reading was that she'd have a huge row with her mother that would lead to her leaving home. The row occurred because her mum wanted to know what the reading said, Bubzi moved out (only for three days but even so), and Barbara didn't speak to me for 6 months. You can see why it put me off!)  So I bought some cards that have been kinda calling me. Crayola showed me them at the moot a few months back, Cabochon had his set of them at Glastonbury, and Phoenix syas he recommended those to me when we first talked about why I felt blocked from tarot (in part because of the stereotypical imagery).  So I bought the  urlLink Witchy Tarot  set. I like the fact the cards seem happy and smiley and that I don't automatically think of "the right meanings" when I look at them (by this I mean all the book stuff popping into my head).  I've bought myself a rather gorgeous notebook where each card will have a page so I can write down what I feel about each of them. I admitt I did look inside the "little white book" *don't hurt me Mab* but only to see how the new suites correspond with the original ones.  I wish I didn't have work so that I could play with my cards, but I do and if I keep typing here then I shall be LATE!

						   ...was a bit pants today.  I was stuck upstairs all day which was very boring. But I did manage to read all the bits of  urlLink Save Karyn  that I wanted too. I also deleted a load of customer orders from Jan 2000 which have been sitting on the system causing Saturday staff to order unavailable things because they see they're on order already.  F was doing returns today, that's why I was upstairs. For the first chunk of the day, every time she was upstairs all I could smell was her perfume (Karma from Lush, that she started wearing cos I did). Then when I realised she was getting to me again and very firmly "stuck up" my mirrored shield, all I could smell was my rose oil (that Aud gave us at the handfasting) even when she was right next to me. I think I've gone off Karma at the moment, possibly because I have run out, and so I can only smell it when F is about - and on her it smells weird.  The  urlLink Save Karyn  book was really interesting and made me wish that I could do the same thing. But I couldn't. Not in my character. Any way, I'm not in half the debt she was; rent is paid, I have work etc etc.  But it did inspire me to want to get selling on eBay again. I just need to get the scanner working and sit down and sort the books I want to sell. I'd offer them to Grove and Moot people but I'm pretty sure that none of them would want them.  I've got enough stuff to sell for the moment anyway; about 20 McDonalds Beanie Babies and lots of books. I need to sit down and list all the books: title/author, condition, weight, size (for packaging quantities). Then I can buy some Jiffy bags and address labels on eBay and get selling!  Period started today, hurt like fuck again. But I got some painkillers and have a glass full of red wine here (my last bottle, that REALLY shows we're skint!) and was going to go to bed early but got playing cards with Matt and so didn't really manage it.  I shall send Mab to bed now, and might go myself.

						   So it started this morning with breakfast in bed.  Breakfast in bed consisted of a large plate/bowl of beans, bacon and Alphabites spelling out "ME LOVE U X".  This made me soppy all day.  Then we talked for ages then I went back to sleep.  Did some washing and put the fairies up in the garden. Then did more washing.  Read WitchGrove and blogs and BBC News and BB5 and played on Neopets.  Managed to forget to write about the handfasting again.  Watched Joan of Arcadia, fabulous show!  Had a long bath while reading Living Dead In Dallas by Charmain Harris.  Spoke to Laura on the phone for 45 minutes while we were both watching BB5. Topics of conversation included Charmed and the fatc that we can't remember any other girls from BB2 other than Helen and the Asian girl.  Thrilling day as you can see, back to work tomorrow throughly recharged and ready for my five day weekend inclusive stint!

						   I know, I'm useless!  But I've just got back from camping in loverly Shropshire so I've had a rather full weekend!  Firstly however....   Pami and Rob's Wedding   I managed to go to this....not all in black! True I had on white and grey instead, but the only other colour I seem to have in my wardrobe is red and I didn't think that would do.  We were a bit late getting there due to heavy traffic on the A12 and then having to park somewhere other than the farm (no spaces left). But the ceremony was beautiful and the Spiral Dance at the end was great fun.  Pami then grabbed me for a "witches" photo and then it was off to the tent for lunch.  Spent lunchtime swapping dirty jokes with Jilly, Sarah, Stella and Nick (plus two other lovely Wolverhampton people whose names I don't know!) and then went off to talk to Benji and Laura.  It was so nice seeing them again, Laura is just the same and Benji, as ever, seemed taller! She's doing scientisty things in Brighton and he's just started policing at an airport and the silly buggers have given him a gun! (Note to people who don't know Benji: He's perfectly safe with it now but we all still see him as Benji from school - definately NOT safe!).  Benji bigged me up about work so I did some bigging up of his fantastic sheep impersonating.  Jane turned up, minus Ian as he was unwell. Alan appeared from somewhere (still looking very very thin) and Amy Thistlethwaite appeared as bouncy as ever. Sarah-Jane turned up a bit later as lovely as I remember her, and Ellen turned up and was a bitch (no change there then).  We talked lots and drank (small amounts for me as I was driving) and then played a strange German party game which Alan won. Then we chatted and listened to jazz until the DJ appeared to get the music going.  There was nothing to dance too at first but as the music got better we all took the floor, and ended up boogying for hours. I danced so much I got cramp in my calves and had to sit down.  Phoenix finally appeared a bit later after working his way through quite a lot of mead. He and Nick had found twelve bottles and had disposed of them between them until Nick passed out and Phoenix came to find me. When he decided to dance to Nellie The Elephant I knew it was time to go!  We said goodbye to everyone, and then found Pami and Rob to say goodbye to. Phoenix talked ALL the way home, mostly funny "I'm a cute heathen", some scary "Your cousin looks like a squashed Charlotte Church" (He meant Sarah-Jane, who isn't my cousin, but does look a bit like Charlotte Church).  We drove all the way back to Billericay with him rabbiting on, and once badgering on after I had to swerve round one that had met a lorry and Phoenix started singing the  urlLink Badger, Badger, Badger  song.  But he didn't have a hangover in the morning, which I was impressed with!  Next post, camping trip...but I have to catch up with the Grove first!

						   A triumphant message from Norman, King of Gnomes:   The King of Gnomes to me he said, Today as I was lying on my bed, "Will you, good Sir, give all my thanks To the Limeys, Welsh, misc and Yanks Who took your heed to scroll up top to stop my brothers from going pop and deliver them a present dear that I have been working on for near a year. That gift is such, which once was mine, a word for Grove with which to rhyme So my best to you on Witchgrove And the best from my dog - his name is Rove- ...r .........  No wait... dont write that last bit down, let me think...... OK how about 'and my dog is choking on a clove?' No? What do you mean its not true? Im the King of Gnomes young man! Here doggy-doggy, Rover.... Too violent? Ok. Well...erm.. Are you still writing this down? Dont put that, and make the whole thing rhyme. And sort your hair out you hippy. And... wait, dont click that Scroll up, SCROLL UP.... *POP*"  Gnomes work hard to run the net, Without their help we'd have never met, But I have a habit I have to stop, I think its funny when Gnomes go *POP*.

						   ...not only do I have Matt flirting as only a handsome, shy 18 year old can, but Katie W brought in a CD she'd made, that'd she'd deliberately put two of my favourite songs on.  Every now and again she'd say "Kate, go stand under a speaker", so I'll toddle off to the Sport table and pretend to tidy it while singing along.  This sone is the best, it sends shivers up my spine. I guess it's the musical equivalent of reading The Dark Is Rising or most Alice Hoffman books. The hair on the back of my neck rises and the world is suddenly full of sparkles...  Drops of Jupiter - Train   Now that she's back in the atmosphere With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey She acts like summer and walks like rain Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey Since the return from her stay on the moon She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey    Tell me did you sail across the sun Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated    Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there    Now that she's back from that soul vacation Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey    Now that she's back in the atmosphere I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land    Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way And tell me, did Venus blow your mind Was it everything you wanted to find And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there    Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me    Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back toward the Milky Way    Tell me did you sail across the sun Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated  Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there  Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

						    urlLink Which Domestic Goddess Are You?   You scored 18.2% Hestia  The goddess of the hearth, Hestia is the ultimate Earth mother -- kind, open, and nurturing. If you are ruled by Hestia, your home is your castle, and cooking your greatest talent and pleasure. You love being surrounded by people and, more importantly, taking care of them; your favorite place is the kitchen, redolent with the smells of food baking or a stew simmering. Comfort is all-important -- your home is warm and cozy with furniture you can sink into -- and you favor clothes with an easy-to-wear, easy-to-take-care-of style. To bring out your inner goddess, decorate with small homey touches -- crochet an afghan or needlepoint a pillow,  urlLink make a pretty wreath  for the doorway, or begin a collection of whimsical china animals -- and stick with a warm color palette, lots of earth tones, russets and oranges. Easygoing Hestia would rather spend her time starting seeds from scratch than polishing furniture, and every room in her house has a nice, relaxed feel to it. Sometimes, though, you forget that the world is worth exploring, and you need to call on  urlLink Artemis  to awaken your sense of adventure. Make sure, too, that you don't ignore romance in your life (you need it, after all); call on  urlLink Aphrodite  to open yourself up to passion and pleasure.     Find out how to  urlLink bring out your inner Hestia  if you scored low in this category.  ----------  You scored 18.2% Artemis  Ruler of the wilderness, Artemis is the free spirit of the domestic goddesses. If you are ruled by Artemis, you are unconventional and secure in your own likes and dislikes. You are your own interior decorator, a collector, eclectic in your tastes. Those mix-and-matched plates and napkins you've been using forever reflect your individuality perfectly. Bright colors (think pinks and greens) in patterns and stripes appeal to your inner goddess. Your favorite room is apt to be lightest, brightest room with the largest windows -- no fussy curtains for you, just bright sunlight, the perfect place for a spur-of-the moment gathering. Trust your own individual flair -- remember, you had animal prints before they were in -- and let your spontaneity shine. Maintaining any easygoing approach to housekeeping and sharing your home with plants and animals appeal to Artemis' love of the energy of the outdoors. Even if you live in a small apartment, let the Artemis in you blossom with a small  urlLink container herb garden  to awaken your senses. You may sometimes put other, more conventional types off with your individual style. And you may also find it hard to sustain a committed relationship because you are attracted to so many different types of people. Take inspiration from  urlLink Hestia  to calm your Artemis side down and become more grounded. Or listen to  urlLink Kuan Yin  to let a different kind of energy into your life.     Need more of Artemis' influence?  urlLink Find out how  to get it.  ----------  You scored 18.2% Penelope  The "weaver" and the most creative of the goddesses, Penelope inspires us to express our personalities and tastes by making things and trying new crafts. She is the part of us that loves working with a glue gun, buying a piece of fabric, stenciling borders on walls and refinishing furniture. If you are ruled by Penelope, you are skilled with your hands and get great satisfaction making things for yourself and others. You are open and free with your gifts and have a large circle of friends and acquaintances. To express this inner goddess, decorate with soft, restful colors -- blues reminiscent of the skies and oceans, with a touch of green -- and focus on the handmade or rescued piece -- the homemade pillow, the  urlLink updated flea market find . Penelope is unafraid to express her own tastes; don't be afraid to experiment with new ideas, new materials, new color combinations. To bring this goddess into your life, teach yourself a new skill or embark on a new project, such as making picture frames or starting a scrapbook. Be patient with yourself -- there's no particular rush to finish your project on a tight schedule. Sometimes, Penelope has us ignore our need for quiet; call on  urlLink Kuan Yin  to remind you of the simple pleasure of sitting alone, doing nothing. You may also become housebound if you're not careful -- working on something new -- so invite the spirit of  urlLink Hera  in and explore the outside world a bit. Your special talents will be well appreciated.     Find out how to  urlLink become more like Penelope  if you scored low in this category.  ----------  You scored 18.2% Aphrodite  The goddess of love whose domain is the bedroom and garden, Aphrodite is the ultimate romantic spirit. If you are ruled by Aphrodite, you are energetic and spontaneous, emotional and romantic, a gifted decorator and a fine gardener. Small details and pretty touches are one of Aphrodite's trademarks -- scented soaps in the bathroom or a bowl of dried rose petals in the bedroom will bring your inner goddess to the fore. Rich floral prints, the look of layer upon layer in window treatments, the most delicate of laces, and soft velvets can make any room in your house or apartment a place of love and romance. Feel free to experiment with rich sensual colors -- the mossiest of greens, the deepest of pinks -- to bring a different kind of depth to your surroundings. (Aphrodite isn't shy about her wants.) Cut flowers or a small bowl filled with pebbles and a single daffodil bulb will bring the spirit of Aphrodite into the house, even in midwinter. Use  urlLink candles , particularly scented ones, to let your inner Aphrodite free and follow your instincts. Keep in mind that your focus on love and romance might lead you to neglect some parts of your life that need tending. Take inspiration from  urlLink Athena , and remember, being just a bit more organized will make your life that much easier.      If you scored low in Aphrodite, find out how to  urlLink invite the goddess of love into your home .  ----------  You scored 18.2% Hera  The queen of the Greek goddess, the multitalented Hera is always on the run. If you are ruled by Hera, you are an assured multitasker who sees tending the home as just one part of a busy life. Decidedly down-to-earth, you're likely to be involved in lots of different activities -- anything from working, coaching a soccer team, tutoring or volunteering or pursuing your own interests -- and your decorating style is practical and low-maintenance. Easy-to-mop floors, washable fabrics and sturdy furniture help simplify your life, as does the latest in kitchen equipment. You favor darker colors that don't show wear and tear. Your favorite style of entertaining is a potluck dinner or a barbeque so that you can do what you like best: talking and listening to other people. Try a  urlLink five-minute centerpiece  to set a mood without a lot of fuss. Get in touch with your inner goddess by setting up a reading group or volunteering where you live. Sometimes, though, you spread yourself too thin and don't give yourself enough of the downtime you need and deserve. In moments like these, call on  urlLink Kuan Yin  for a bit of introspection or take a hint from  urlLink Athena  and do just one thing at a time.      Could you use a little more of Hera's influence? Find out  urlLink how to bring her out .  ----------  You scored 9.1% Kuan Yin  The domestic goddess of compassion and understanding, Kuan Yin is the necessary corrective to the busy and fast pace of everyday life. If you are ruled by Kuan Yin, you are introspective and spiritual by nature, focused on the essential things in life. You are the friend whom others turn to in times of turmoil and trouble. Simplicity is this goddess' hallmark, and your decorating style is open and uncluttered. Clean, classic lines appeal to you -- no ruffles or flounces. A single, beautiful object will give your eye a spot to linger, such as a  urlLink tabletop fountain  created in one of your favorite vases. Open up to this goddess's influence by choosing natural fabrics -- cottons and linens -- over synthetics and sticking with a color palette of wood tones, black and white, and the occasional jewel tone, such as amethyst or emerald. Set aside a place for meditation in your home -- it need only be a windowsill -- and choose objects with personal resonance, such as a beautiful seashell, a perfect flower or a candle to decorate it. Appealing to your inner goddess will awaken your spirit. Sometimes your need for perfection gets in your way and your unhurried nature has you running late or missing deadlines entirely. Quiet by temperament and inclination, you sometimes miss some of the opportunities afforded by the outside world. Call on adventurous  urlLink Artemis  or romantic  urlLink Aphrodite  to bring a little spice into your life.       urlLink Learn how to nurture your inner Kuan Yin .  ----------  You scored 0% Athena  The domestic goddess of order, Athena is an organizer and an efficient perfectionist. If you are ruled by Athena, others often look to you for advice and guidance, particularly when it comes to decision making, and you are likely to be the leader of any group. You are a skilled, if formal, hostess, and you're likely to set a color-coordinated table, with gleaming silver and crystal accents. Your traditional tastes give your home an easy, timeless elegance -- you prefer whites and the palest of pinks, blues, and celadons -- and you naturally gravitate to simple, classic design for both your living and dining rooms. Your inner goddess is a natural housekeeper; she loves the look of an  urlLink orderly closet  and organized drawers. The perfect flower arrangement in a beautiful vase will give you a great sense pleasure. To some, you may seem a bit set in your ways, and sometimes your inability to leave anything undone makes it hard for you to relax and unwind. Call on  urlLink Artemis  to free up some of your energy, or ask  urlLink Hestia  to remind you to just let go a bit. You don't really need to polish the furniture today.     If you scored low in Athena, find out  urlLink how to tap into her powers .

						   ...so he wrote poetry instead.  Whether you're Witch Or whether you're Wittan, In the US, Europe or Britain, Whether your druid, heathen or Celt, There's a place that love can always be felt. Its a little place right here on-line, Where everything is good, everythings fine, Some talk of laughter others appease, People like me only spout Cheese, But one things for certain as I sit by my stove, It really hard to rhyme the word 'Grove'.  -----------------------------------  When you're surfing the internet back at home, Dont make the mistake of thinking your alone, For in Pagan Cyberland a few creatures reside, Who run and duck and duck and hide, From pagan 'Real-ies' who invade their home, With broad band connection or dial-up phone. For their existance is always threatened, By lazy 'Realies' not nuclear weapons, So after you click - scroll back to the top, Coz every half page makes a Gnome go Pop.  -----------------------------------  That's what happens when he can't sleep....

						   Well, a tape anyway. &nbsp; I was doing some tidying in the "library" and found a box of cassettes. There was some very random stuff in there and also one tape labeled KJ 1 6/7/00. This means that it was the first mix tape I made while I was with James (who I lived with for a year) and I made it on the 6th July 2000. &nbsp; The music is fabulous! &nbsp; Track listing: &nbsp; More Life In A Tramps Vest -&nbsp;Stereophonics Road Rage -&nbsp;Catatonia Tied To The 90's -&nbsp;Travis Midnight In Chelsea - Bon Jovi Monday Morning 5:19 - Rialto Drop Dead Gorgeous - Republica Not Where It's At - Del Amitri Lullaby - Shawn Mullins Truly, Madly, Deeply - Savage Garden Any Way You Look - Northern Uproar Traffic - Sterophonics I Don't Know - Ruth KATE - Ben Folds Five Smooth - Santana Dancing In The Moonlight - Toploader One Week - Bare Naked Ladies Sitting Down Here - Lene Marlin Local Boy In The Photograph - Sterophonics Untouchable - Rialto Kiss Me - Sixpence None The Richer I Quit - Hepburn Rushour - Joyrider Beautiful Ones - Suede Ladykiller - Lush You &amp; Me Song - Wannadies Perseverance - Terrorvision &nbsp; SEE!!!! Look at the TUUUUNES! &nbsp; I had a big big music phase that summer and not only was I buying up lots of new singles from new bands (Rialto, Hepburn, Bare Naked Ladies) but I also dug up some old stuff that I'd been reminded of by the Glastonbury Festival. I mean I'd watched Travis headlining on the Saturday night, then I got home and listened to their very very first single from about 5 years before (cos I bought it while doing my GCSEs I think, and that was 1995). &nbsp; So I have the music on LOUD and Phoenix is downstairs with the tv turned up. I think it might be too loud as the occupant of the end room shut the door earlier, and they haven't done that since we moved in! &nbsp; We've got stuff to list on eBay today so I suppose I'd better get it done! &nbsp;

						   I put the books I've been reading onto my other blog at last. I've been meaning to do this for ages but adding the links and things always makes it really involved.  Just won a nice cross-stitch book on eBay, more stitchy ideas woo hoo!  Still working on the first of my two secret projects. Mab really liked the first one and the way I'm cracking on with it I might well finish it tomorrow.  Going to go see what I can find to turn into patterns.

						   It's been strange today. I had a horrible feeling of forboding hanging over my head until about half five. Phoenix is off doing a Greenpeace thing tonight and tomorrow morning so I am all by myself until he gets back tomorrow night. I really wasn't looking forward to it but the after work got a text reminding me that he loved me very much and that he was doing this "to try to create a better world for our children" which made me all teary.  But I should be ok tonight. I do have period pain from hell, but have invested in a few things to keep me ticking over:  Red Wine M&M's Kettle Chips Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie Icecream  Plus I bought myself two new books:  Depression for Dummies Healing Without Freud or Prozac  These might just help me get my brain sorted out....at last!  Right then, off to read WitchGrove and then to watch tv, read Lone Pine books and eat icecream!

						   Sewer Walking   You and me, we used to talk  Like a river underground, the sewer where we used to walk.  The hole at the end empties out to the pier  Where paperboats disappear   Me, I try to send this note,  Float it like a paper boat,  But paper sinks and words are weak.  I try but I don't speak   Join together in the silent snow  Turn our faces up to see  Not endless night, but day  A pier  And you and me, talking.

						   Phoenix is out at a Greenpeace meeting tonight so I have been left to my own devices. I'm done all my usual internet stuff, watched the latest two episodes of  urlLink Joan of Arcadia , and moved the stereo from the bedroom to the computer room as I need music while I surf (earlier I had Mariah Carey singing some awful christmas song stuck in my head over and over).  While looking at my CDs (mostly bought while I was at uni) I spotted the one that mum gave me when we went home for Nana's funeral.  It's the CD called Bridging the Gap by Allen Beechey's Bright Stars of Jazz. Now I'm not usually a jazz kind of gal, but this CD is different. This is a CD featuring a young man named George Fagg on piano. You can find out a bit about George  urlLink here .  I just decided to listen to it for the first time tonight. It's pretty damn groovy really, although I know bugger all about jazz except for what Richard at work tells me. But I know that in about 5 minutes I will be crying my heart out.  Why?  Because Track Five will be playing, I Will Weather The Storm; written by George Fagg, and performed by his fellow band members at his funeral.  Better go find some tissues...

						   Well Georgia Belle has been and gone, she's on her plane home right now. It was so fabulous to meet her, this week will be remembered for lots of fun stuff and frolics, rather than the slime that is so close to the top right now.  I bonded so much with the other Glastonbury Campers this week as well. I learnt a lot of stuff about myself and other people. I did tarot readings for Jennie and Juell that they liked lots and that made sense for them, and I did one for the camping trip that I shouldn't have dismissed.  One of the things I learnt was to trust my own intuition. It's strange you know, various people have been telling me this for ages but when it came down to it they were the ones telling me I was wrong. Well, they have their opinions and I have mine and I know we can still get along even though we differ on this. The issue will hopefully never come up again.  I've been cleaning since Mab and Aud left after we dropped Georgia at the airport. I've cleansed all round the house to get rid of the slimy energy I've felt for most of the week, I've washed lots of things and sorted stuff for disposal too. I've been quite productive considering how tired I am! I just keep remembering how perfect the time in the meadow at Chalice Wells was, with the blue sky overhead and Jamie blowing bubbles.  Now Phoenix wants the computer so I shall work out how we're going to organise the ritual room for ourselves (and the WWWG) and I'll probably do some sewing too. I might just make a start on the apparently "horrible" Southern Belle pattern that I bought on eBay, although I've got some protection and confidence charms that I want to work on for a friend who got hit hard by stuff this week.  *grabs up Chalice Well water and smudge sticks and goes to fight last drops of slime*
