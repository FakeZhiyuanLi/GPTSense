       I think I'm feeling nostalgic for life in Montana. I've had a renewed interest in country, specifically Merle and Johnny, and in insurgent country (I just adore Robby Fulks, but I have several great CDs from Bloodshot Records). Anyhow, we listened to it all the time in Montana, and I think I'm longing for it again.   I mean, what could be better than time apart from the world, drinking whiskey, playing shuffleboard at the local bar, dancing the two-step late into the night? I miss my friends from there, but only as we all were at that time... now distance&nbsp;or too much closeness have taken their toll on us. But oh, what a time we had.&nbsp;Months spent&nbsp;in a mountain lodge, nearly 20 of us recently out of college, living and working together. It was incredible, and I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed being around everyone and how much I cared for them all, especially Josh, Jessica, Truxton, and Margaret.   Margaret was a student intern at our work, and she's one of those self-possessed, intelligent, competent, vivacious people that just draw people to her. For the first couple of weeks, we didn't really like each other too much, but one night had a wonderful talk and just hit it off. When I think of Margaret, I picture someone who could change the world just by willing it so, but more because she would have the insight and inspire the rest of us to follow her. We danced together so often in the bars, I think some of the local townsfolk thought we might have been involved. But really, it was just a natural, happy extension of how we were together. I was so sad when she left at the end of summer.   Jessica was everything I didn't see myself as - cool and fiercely smart, sexy and possessed with a joy of living that made you want to act silly and spend all of your time together. Everything would be a sensual experience with her; drinking dry merlot, sampling crisp green apples, sharp cheddar cheese and dark chocolate, she elevated each moment to something worth savoring. We had the same feminist leanings, political interests, and often banded together with Margaret for fun "girls only" times.   Josh was like a member of my own family - I felt like he was my kid brother at times, reminding him to wipe his boots or chiding him for not eating vegetables. He "got" me in an instinctive way, and we would plan our futures together, his with Jessica and a brood of children in a cabin in the woods, mine back in Oregon with a husband and maybe no kids at all, both of us writers and always friends. I felt like a kid with Josh, and we ran all over the place holding hands like two children skipping together. It was so silly and comfortable and easy with Josh, and he worried that I spent too much time in my head, which was funny.   Truxton was a kindred spirit - funny and maybe a little too loud, trying to cover up a heart too soft to survive on its own. I can't think about Trux without hearing his music in my head - Elliot Smith and Nick Drake, Ween and the Supersuckers, Squeeze and the Waterboys, the Gourds... Truxton was the first of our group to be fired by our psycho boss, and when he left, it felt like my heart was breaking. Trux, Jessica, Josh and I danced and cried at the bar to Bob Marley's Redemption Song, and it still hollows me out to hear it.   Josh and Jessica married and, last I heard, are living near Chicago. Margaret finished classes and moved from NYC to somewhere outside of Boston. Truxton took a stab at big-city life, but found he hated Seattle and moved back to Montana. Sometimes I dream of a reunion, but mostly, I'm happy with the memories.   Hmm. I may need to write more about these people later. They were such a wonderful group of people, and I haven't even mentioned Greg, Brian, or Lucy.  Perhaps if I write more about them, I will learn more about the nostalgic sentiments...   In the meantime, I'll be cranking up the Man in Black and dancing in my apartment.   &nbsp;

       I have always loved this poem. The first time I read it, I cried a little. Alan Ginsberg had such heart, such panic, such passion. His poetry - like many others of the Beat Generation - is almost tangible.    Sunflower Sutra    by Allen Ginsberg    I walked on the banks of the tincan banana dock and  sat down under the huge shade of a Southern  Pacific locomotive to look at the sunset over the  box house hills and cry.   Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron  pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts  of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed,  surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of  machinery.   The oily water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun  sank on top of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that  stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves  rheumy-eyed and hungover like old bums  on the riverbank, tired and wily.   Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray  shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting  dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust--  --I rushed up enchanted--it was my first sunflower,  memories of Blake--my visions--Harlem  and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes  Greasy Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black  treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the  poem of the riverbank, condoms & pots, steel  knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck  and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the  past--   and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset,  crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog  and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye--  corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like  a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face,  soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays  obliterated on its hairy head like a dried  wire spiderweb,   leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures  from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster  fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear,  Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O  my soul, I loved you then!   The grime was no man's grime but death and human  locomotives,   all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad  skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black  mis'ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance  of artificial worse-than-dirt--industrial--  modern--all that civilization spotting your  crazy golden crown--   and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless  eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the  home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar  bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards  of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely  tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what  more could I name, the smoked ashes of some  cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the  milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs  & sphincters of dynamos--all these  entangled in your mummied roots--and you there  standing before me in the sunset, all your glory  in your form!   A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent  lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye  to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited  grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden  monthly breeze!   How many flies buzzed round you innocent of your  grime, while you cursed the heavens of the  railroad and your flower soul?   Poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a  flower? when did you look at your skin and  decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive?  the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and  shade of a once powerful mad American locomotive?   You were never no locomotive, Sunflower, you were a  sunflower!   And you Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me  not!   So I grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck  it at my side like a scepter,  and deliver my sermon to my soul, and Jack's soul  too, and anyone who'll listen,   --We're not our skin of grime, we're not our dread  bleak dusty imageless locomotive, we're all  beautiful golden sunflowers inside, we're blessed  by our own seed & golden hairy naked  accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black  formal sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our  eyes under the shadow of the mad locomotive  riverbank sunset Frisco hilly tincan evening  sitdown vision.

       I sometimes have a hard time letting people really get to know me. It's much easier to keep them at arm's length. Aren't most people ultimately more interested in themselves than in others? Simply turning questions around on people is an easy way to avoid being drawn out, and if you can couple that with a few quick jokes and an insight here or there, people don't even notice you aren't revealing much about yourself.  It's odd. I choose to be alone, because I seem to have a somewhat magnetic personality. I make friends easily, I'm just not interested in having friends for the most part. This makes me question myself - the distance I have from everyone else. I spent several years convinced I was a sociopath simply because I don't think that normal rules apply to me and I view most of the people I encounter with curiosity or contempt more than affection and connection. But I'm not really a sociopath. When I do love somebody, it's with all my heart. And I will do anything for the people I care about without regard for myself.   Two things principally keep me apart from the world. One is self-protection: I have had my heart broken by people I thought were my friends, and I am unwilling to risk it again. As I said, if I love you, I will do anything for you - and I no longer trust my own judgement to find people worthy of that kind of devotion. Giving it to the wrong people is dangerous - they take what they can, then abandon you, or they misuse your trust until you trust nobody (which is where I'm at now, I guess). The other thing that keeps me apart is, I guess, arrogance. Frankly, most people bore me and blunder through their lives in a way I would describe as stupidly. So why bother developing relationships with people I have little regard for? Boring people are the worst - I want to learn, to be challenged, to enjoy myself, and truly boring people are good for only one thing: making everything around them boring, as well.   But despite all of that, I have a deep well of compassion and emotion within me. Of course, it remains deep in part because it is largely untapped. I wonder if I can be whole until I use that as readily as I do my intellect. I wonder if I can be happy without using it, or without developing more attachments to people. If I don't live in an open-hearted way, will much of the world be closed off to me? Or is that only the sort of thing touchy-feely people assert, not the  real  truth?

       I'm always interested in learning more about what makes people tick, and more specifically, the things that make me tick. Here are a few things I've learned about me - and a few links to help to you discover more about yourself.    Myers-Briggs Personality Tests    I'm an INTJ, often referred to as "The Scientist" or "The Mastermind." INTJs live in the world of ideas and strategic planning. They value intelligence, knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which they continuously strive to fulfill. To a somewhat lesser extent, they have similar expectations of others. With Introverted Intuition dominating their personality, INTJs focus their energy on observing the world, and generating ideas and possibilities. Their mind constantly gathers information and makes associations about it. They are tremendously insightful and usually are very quick to understand new ideas. However, their primary interest is not understanding a concept, but rather applying it in a useful way.   INTJ's tremendous value and need for systems and organization, combined with their natural insightfulness, makes them excellent scientists. It is not easy for the INTJ to express their internal images, insights, and abstractions. The internal form of the INTJ's thoughts and concepts is highly individualized, and is not readily translatable into a form that others will understand. They usually don't see the value of a direct transaction, and will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are non-linear.  INTJs are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the background until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in leadership roles, they are quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are adaptable enough to change things which aren't working well. They are the supreme strategists - always scanning available ideas and concepts and weighing them against their current strategy, to plan for every conceivable contingency.   You can find out more about INTJs by  urlLink clicking here . For more on the Myers-Briggs types, try one of the following links:   urlLink  BLOGinality    Take the test  urlLink  here  .    The Enneagram    This is less widely recognized than the Myers-Briggs personality typing, but it's still a LOT of fun to learn about. Individuals fit into one of nine types, and this system provides some very intriguing insights about personality type. I'm a type 8, sometimes called The Boss or The Challenger.   urlLink       Learn more about the Enneagram by  urlLink clicking here  or  urlLink visiting this site .

        "A true friend is someone who thinks that you are a good egg even though he knows that you are slightly cracked."   ~ Bernard Meltzer   Perhaps my dearest friend in the world is Sarah, who lives almost entirely across the country from me. I am so comfortable with her because she  gets me.  She really knows what makes me tick, and isn't afraid to call me on my BS when I need it (and I often do). When you throw in a healthy dose of self-deprecating, sarcastic, and silly humor with a laugh that makes you giggle to hear it and a mind as sharp as the best ginzu knives advertised on TV, well, she's pretty much irresistable.   "Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: 'What! You, too? Thought I was the only one.'"  ~  C.S. Lewis   We have such a good time together because there's no real need to hide things from each other. I don't know that I've ever had a friend like that before, and with her so far away, I wonder if I'll have one like that again. Don't get me wrong; Sarah and I will always be friends - heck, we're as close to family as you can get without sharing DNA. But I miss that closeness, and I suspect she does, too. While I would be jealous, I would also want her to find a friend like me where she is, and I certainly hope for my own sake that I find someone like her here.   "We do not so much need the help of our friends as the confidence of their help in need."  ~  Epicurus   I miss Sarah, and hearing her voice over the phone is sometimes like getting that first gulp of icy water when you've been too long in the sun. But maybe even more than Sarah, I miss the simple companionship, silences that are not awkward, laughter without explanation, hearts assured of their mutual trust and love.

        I am a A Moon Dragon!   I took the  urlLink http://dragonhame.com/  online Inner Dragon quiz and found out I am a Moon Dragon on the inside.  In the war between good and evil, a Moon Dragon tends to walk the fine line of neutrality. When it comes to the powers of Chaos vs. those of Law and Order, your inner dragon is a risk taker and answers to no one...  As far as magical tendancies, your inner dragon has the ability to conquer the world of magic, but it will not be easy. During combat situations, whether by spells or by claw, your inner dragon will do whatever it takes to get the job done. The Moon Dragon has translucent scales and emits a soft white glow from its body, thus earning its name.The moon dragon is an especially large dragon, but beautiful and graceful. It makes its home in mountainous regions, often picking a large cavern to be its lair.  Moon dragons are nocturnal in nature, only coming out at night. They silently fly through the nighttime sky, hunting deer, antelope or other woodland creatures. The moon dragon has a particularly long lifespan even amongst dragonkind. Some moon dragons have been known to live for several millennia, making it one of the longest lived creatures in existence.  This dragon's favorite elements are: Moonstone, Starlight, and Longevity   Chinese Astrology   I found the dragon thing interesting because I am a dragon according to Chinese astrology.  The Dragon is one of the most powerful and lucky Signs of the Chinese Zodiac. Its warm heart makes the Dragon's brash, fiery energy far more palatable. This is a giving, intelligent and tenacious Sign that knows exactly what it wants and is determined to get it. Dragons possess a certain natural, charming charisma that ensures they can always influence their peers and often find themselves the center of attention in social situations. This Sign is truly blessed, too; Dragons are considered to be very lucky in love! The Dragon's friends are always keen to hear what this firebrand has to say and when it comes to dispensing advice, the Dragon has the floor.  Its ego can get in the Dragon's way, but even so, this larger-than-life creature has a knack for initiating projects and keeping the troops motivated. According to Dragons, it's their natural born right to lead the way -- because who else could do it so surely and so well? As lucky as they are, Dragons have a good chance of achieving considerable material wealth during their lifetimes, although it isn't mere money that's this Sign's main motivation. Power is what the Dragon wants and truly believes it deserves. Dragons are quite the opportunists, forever searching for ways in which to consolidate their considerable power. Contrary to all this strength and fire, a weakened Dragon is a sad sack, a creature that refuses to take defeat with even a modicum of grace.  The role of leader is the only one the Dragon wants, the better from which to give orders and be king of the hill. They make solid leaders, too, knowing instinctively what needs to be done to stay on top. Crossing the Dragon is never a good idea -- this beast can singe! A valuable life lesson for this clever creature would be to absorb the principles of flexibility, compassion and tolerance. Being high and mighty can serve to inspire others, but it also keeps Dragons from living their lives to the fullest. If Dragons can learn to balance their quest for success with an appreciation for the little things, their life will be more than worthwhile.  The most compatible match for a Dragon is the  Monkey  or the  Rat .  To find your sign, go to:   urlLink http://chinese.astrology.com/?ice=ast,tabchi,sign

       I suspect at times that the universe is trying to communicate with us. I haven't exactly worked out what "higher power" might be out there - is it a Judeo-Christian God? Allah? the Goddess of Wiccan faith? - but I do get the sense that there is a benevolent force out there.  I've been kicking around an idea in my head, that the only way to improve your life is to live as if it has already been improved. I'm not saying that you dream of winning the lottery, so you max out your credit cards on Rolexes and vacations. I just feel that maybe the only way to not be sad is to rush out and seek, expect, and embrace happiness, or that the only way to be healthy is live healthfully. Eventually, you'll find happiness and fun if you're out there looking for it. While you may be in terrible shape, if you eat right, exercise, and do all of the things you know you "should," you actually  will  get healthy. But I wasn't sure what to make of this idea.  Then one of the people on the INTJ-open list posted a message about cognitive behavioral therapy. (Follow this MoodGYM link  urlLink http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/ ) The premise of the treatment is that you can go through these exercises and actually see some improvement in your depression and mood as a result, especially if you have mild to moderate depression (severe depression is a beast of a different nature, I suppose). A lot of this centers on choosing your own mood and feelings and controlling your negative thoughts. This fits neatly in with the "act happy, be happy" thing I've been musing over.  So I was channel surfing the other night, and a  Dr. Phil  rerun came on. He was talking about depression, and said that he sometimes told people he was treating to simply  act  like they weren't depressed. He said it worked wonders, because once you break out of a depressed pattern, your life really does start to seem better. I was like, "Ha ha, Dr. Phil! I thought of that on my own, without all the years of book learnin' you went through!"  So twice this idea comes to me from external sources. Then, today, I found this in my e-mail inbox:  Live in joy, In love, Even among those who hate.  Live in joy, In health, Even among the afflicted.  Live in joy, In peace, Even among the troubled.  Look within. Be still. Free from fear and attachment, Know the sweet joy of the way.  ~from the Dhammapada     Things come in threes, right? So I need to be doing something with this. I'm trying to decide what my next step should be. Too much stuff may derail my self-improvement kick. But I am either pushing myself or being pushed to give this a try.

       It's weird. I've spent a lot of time alone in the past few years, but I suddenly seem to be hitting a more social stride. I don't know what's going on, but I don't want to think too much about it because I may stop if I do - and I'm having lots of fun right now.  I joined a book club seven months ago because I told my counselor I would, and it's an excuse to read books I might not ordinarily pick up. It's been even more enjoyable than I thought it would be, much to my delight. But it's a monthly thing, so it doesn't take me out of the apartment much. Except now we're talking about meeting for fun in addition to doing it for the sake of the book club itself, because we get along so well.  Then last weekend, I went with some work friends to a dinner theater, which turned out to be a great experience despite the fact it was an all-new venue for me to visit (I don't like going places that are unfamiliar to me, which has previously helped to limit my social activities). Great conversation, one of the most interesting musicals I have seen (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), good food... It's something I would do again, even!  A friend I haven't talked to much in the past few months recently popped into mind, so I gave her a call. Then she called me the next day and suggested we do something together, so we went out to dinner last week and talked for an hour or so. I think I'll probably call her sometime this week so we can meet up again.  This weekend, my mom, my sister, and I hosted a shower for my cousin, who lives in another state (most of my family lives in either Oregon or Washington; Des is from Washington). She came down with her parents, which we expected, but she also brought two bridesmaids. I was not necessarily looking forward to meeting them, especially since it would require  entertaining  them on Saturday night. I was thinking, "Shit, I don't know what a couple of 23-year-old girls would want to do for fun. I'm old!"   I'll be 28 later this month.  Anyhow, they arrive, and are just too much fun. Yes, they are used to partying and all of that, but dinner out and drinks in was all they could afford, so that's what we did. We drank Washington Apple Shots - Crown Royale, Apple Pucker, and cranberry juice - which is a very frou-frou drink for me (I'm more of a two-ingredient gal, like rum & coke, gin &amp; tonic, whiskey & ice cubes, etc.). But they were completely nice, very funny, and full of great stories. It was a hoot, and it makes me look forward to attending Des' wedding next month.  So now, I'm wondering if I'll be able to keep this up. And if I'm feeling more social, will I also see other changes in my life, other areas I've been meaning to work on? I'm thinking, "I still have work to do in my apartment - new drapes, rearranging furniture, redecorating my bedroom. I would like to get my home business cranking again, too. And it wouldn't hurt to tune up the old diet and exercise bit, because I would feel so much better if I did..."  Interestingly, I just went off antidepressants. I really NEEDED to be on antidepressants when I started them, so I'm wondering if this is a result of being drug-free, or if this is just a lull before I sink into a deeper depression. I hope I'll notice quickly if things take a turn toward the blues, so I can get back on Wellbutrin before it gets bad again.
