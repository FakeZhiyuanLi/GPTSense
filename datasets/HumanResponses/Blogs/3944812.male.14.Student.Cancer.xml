       Hey everyone,   It's Mike (Sawdon.) I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm so glad to be out of Pineland! So...Nate...I see you didn't invite me to your party a couple weeks ago and yet you manage to invite Shawn...Hmmm...I guess I'm just not a good enough friend. God...I'm so angry with Shawn! [ANGRY NOT JEALOUS] He tries to make everything a competition between me and him. I've given up trying to ignore what he's doing. I don't see why we couldn't just be share our friends....Anyways... At first I think I beat him (my friends at school started to hang around me and not him.) But not anymore. My friends at school (not including Nate and Rhi and people like that) are a bunch of...I don't know if you're allowed to use profanities on this site...They used me to get to Jamie and used him to get to Bryan...Oh well...I won't have to deal with them next year. They're all off to Nelson. Shawn got back at me when we went to France with my band. All my friends there turned against me. I don't know why I just wrote all that but if anyone bothered to read...Anyways...I hope next year I'll be able to make better friends that won't stab me in the back everytime I turn around. *cough*Shawn and Nate*cough* Yes you Nate, I don't understand why you wouldn't invite me to your party! Anyways, I guess I'll but a picture of some friends (and maybe me) while we were in France (I have a new computer and those are the only pictures on it.)   So, bye everyone, see you next year!
