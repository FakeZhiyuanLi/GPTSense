         I spent 2 months in Costa Rica and Panama this past spring and it was amazing. I saw both the caribean and pacific coasts as well as Panama City and Bocas Del Toro in Panama.  I began my travels in Liberia, which is in the northern Provice of Guanacaste. I spent one night here and headed south for Jaco Beach, the most popular surf town in Costa Rica. It cost me about $935 collones which is about 3 bucks Canadian to travel about 150KM. Not a bat price for a bus ride. A few transfers later in little towns where I had no idea of where I was and had no idea how to communicate; I made it into Jaco Beach about 8 hours later.    My first impression was, this place was cool! Surfers and hot ladies everywhere. Travellers, vacationers, expats and people just sort of living the touch and go lifestyle. Parasdise!    I spent about 5 days here, and this is where I met what were to become my travel companions for the next four weeks. The first 2 guys I spoke to when I arrived were of course Canadians. Ori and Dan were eating lunch at a cantina on the main road I just so happend to pick this joint. Dead tired, sweating and anxious to drop my heavy pack i pick the cantina to have a little refuling food before i found a place to stay.    Wasn't long before I struck up a conversation with the two of them. I asked if they knew a good place to crash. Ori pointed me to a place called   chucks hostel and surfshop.   Thanked the dudes and headed for Chucks. Nice place, dorm style rooms and english speaking people.    Got to my dorm room and droped on nmy bed. I was finally here and redy to let it soak in. I headed to the beach to see the ocean and go for a swim. The beach was about a 40 second walk from chucks and man was it awesome. Fine sand, hot sun and a huge ocean. Amazing. I sat on the beach to take it all in, it was such a great feeling to be there right then. The sounds of the ocean crashing the feeling that their wasn't a stress in the world. I was at peace and could hardly contain myself.My ear to ear smile streached so far, I started to laugh. :)    I hooked up with Ori and Dan and hung with them for a while. A few days later, two young swiss hotties rolled into Chucks as I sat in my rocking chari made of rebar and plastic. They were tired and dragging the asses a little. Sabrina and Sandra, two free spirted girls travelling for an un determined amount of time. a tent, two packs and few skirts a swim suite and sandals. They sure traveled light. Sandra Crashed pretty quickly and slept for about 16 hours while Sabrina and I headed out for a walk and some food. We hung out and just shared our life experieces. It was awesome. She was a great girl who had lots of life experiece for only being in here early twenties. She was a very interesting girl.    After introducing the guys and the girls to each other we decied to have a BBQ at Chuck's. All five of us went shopping and found somethingto cook on the BBQ. It was a great night, hung out had a few cervesa's and kicked back and got to know each other. We were discussing where everyone was going to travel to next and the five of us were all looking at heading the same direction. Later that night we headed to the beach to take a walk and check out themoon and the stars. It was a beautiful hot night. Wandering on the beach, the girls asked if I would hang with them for a few days. Head south together and see where the road takes us. Of course I said yes and was excited to have found some great friends to travel with, at least for a while.

       Here is an article on the event we are putting on in Winnipeg. Learn more at  urlLink www.navigatethestreets.com     "More Amazing Race than Eco-Challenge"   A couple jumps off a bus and sprints toward you. The man grips a street map, the woman a camera. She thrusts in into your hands and demands: “Take our picture – now!”   Demented tourists? No, just a pair of “urbaneers.” This summer, expect to see more of these citified adventurers, as Navigate the Streets expands from its debut race in Toronto to eight other Canadian cities (including Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax). More Amazing Race than Eco-Challenge, the new race series asks partners to solve clues and find 10 urban landmarks. (Last year, the 150 racers had to unscramble “Made Lethal Bingo” to reach the HQ of “The Globe and Mail”) At each checkpoint, competitors must get their photo taken with a Polaroid or digital camera as proof.   Hardcore racers might pooh-pooh an event that permits cellphones, the Internet and public transit as navigational aids. But as director Tim Shore explains: “We’re saying,’Hey, let’s take advantage of this great urban playground and just have fun in it.’” Adventure racers have been competing for some years in other urban events, such as Calgary’s Inner Limits and Adventure Racing Canada’s annual Toronto melee, at which team rapelled of city hall.   Shore attributes urbaneering’s popularity to busy metropolitans who may not have the time for a backcountry event. “They can do our race in the morning and still have time to do their groceries in the afternoon.”    urlLink www.navigatethestreets.com

      Think fast on your feet. Urban racing at its best is coming to Winnipeg. Teams of two compete to win a trip to Montreal and a chance to win $10,000.  Teams are given 10 clues which identify checkpoints around the city. The teams find them, take pictures of them all with the use of cellphones, the internet and city transit to win.  This is going to be the coolest urban race Winnipeg has ever seen.  Fore more information visit  urlLink www.navigatethestreets.com   Also visit the event blog  urlLink here .

      The three favorite pass times of Winnipegers has got to be drinking booze, smoking pot and eating shity food.  The reason for these bad habits in my opinion is the shity climate. With only 2.5 months of nice weather a year, Winnipegers are forced indoors because its just to fucking cold to participate in outdoor activities. Being inside for 9.5 months out of the year can get pretty boring and habitual. TV has the population trained to smoke, drink watch, comercial, eat and repeat... Its rather sad but a part of reality in this city.  This city need a dome like the lost city of atlantis so that we can enjoy the sun even if its -30 outside.

      I'm so sick of this dam rain. 6 weeks ago I was in Costa Rica, surfing in the sun. I decided to come back and hang out in Winnipeg for the summer because its usually 30 degrees. Not yet, the weather sucks.  I'm working at a publishing company right now but not feeling the vibe. Doing inside sales and feeling a little cramped. I'm used to working on my own time and now I have a boss. Not sure how long this will last. We will just have to see.  Well, Sam Katz just got elected as the Mayor of Winnipeg. I'm hoping this promotion master can help winnipeg crawl out of the slump its been in. Winnipeg so badly needs a progressive business man running the city. Fuck the politics and run this town like a business. If this town were a business it would have been bankrupt years ago.

       Yesterday I watched  urlLink Billabong Odyssey .  Great movie about BIG WAVE surfing and the guys that surf them. They focused on a location called Cortes Bank. I read an article in Surfing magazine about this surf spot and this team of guys that went to Surf it. These are not young guys, in the late 30s and 40s these are trained experienced surfers and they are NUTS. The footage they produced in this film is great. Their web site also has great photos of some of the expeditions out to the reef.   The Cortes Bank is a reef almost 200 kM off the coast of California. Its a big rock in the&nbsp;ocean and when the wind is right, their are 100 foot waves. Ya, Nuts I know.&nbsp;    urlLink About.com Article on the&nbsp;Cortes Bank     urlLink Awesome Video&nbsp;footage    This is a great movie if your into surfing. My favorite to surf is in  urlLink Dominical, Costa Rica . Nice beach break with consitent waves and the ladies are&nbsp;pretty fine&nbsp;there too..  :)

        With a friend on almost every continent, my friends have got to be the best ones around.&nbsp; We manage to effortlessly keep in touch through&nbsp;the great and not so great tough times in life.    &nbsp;   You gotta hand it t o the geeks in this world, they have created the technology that&nbsp;allows&nbsp;us to share&nbsp;a laugh, a cry, or just a sweet hello with each other. More people need to think globally and try and build friendships in other countries and cultures, it's an experience that just might&nbsp;shift ones&nbsp;perceptions.

You should, its the best way to stay healty, loose weigh and be happy. Anyone can run. check out the running room for more details.    urlLink www.runningroom.com &nbsp;

       I went to my mail box today and I had received my local neighbors newspaper, a publication by the Winnipeg Free Press for the downtown area. The publication is about the size of two newspaper inserts and has great community information within it.   The problem I had was not with the news paper, it's with the flyers that were stuffed inside it. In the 2 sections of content in Neighbors,&nbsp;there was 12 flyers with an average of 15 pages each. Now in my house I don't even read them and simply recycle them&nbsp;where&nbsp; I assume&nbsp;they go to recycle land and are turned back into something else somewhat useful.   My first reaction was "what a waste of 1) paper, 2) money, 3) energy. These big box branded businesses just spend crazy&nbsp;dollars on advertising and really have no idea if it works or not. I just don't agree with it. I think they need to learn how to market their business&nbsp;in a more effective manner and maybe a more tree friendly manner.   urlLink www.winnipegfreepress.com

       Grand beach has got to be one of Manitiba's best attractions. Once rated one of the top 10 beaches in North America by Playboy magazine this place has the best sand, sun and of course&nbsp;Manitoba women.   One of the major problems with this awesome&nbsp;Manitoba destination&nbsp;is the government that is in control of it.&nbsp; For years they have continuouly squashed all sorts of great ideas that would help turn Grand Beach into an amazing resort town. A new project that has just been launched is hoped to change that.   Robert Rindahl, Project Manager, Cal Investments,&nbsp;has&nbsp;announced the location and preliminary layout of   ESCALA GOLF AND WINTER RESORT  ,&nbsp; at Grand Marais, Manitoba, Canada.   The&nbsp;world class resort will&nbsp;include a luxury 50 room hotel, 18 hole&nbsp;golf course & clubhouse with licenced dining room &amp; lounge, 250 seat&nbsp;conference centre and 2 driving ranges.&nbsp; Aside from the resort and hotel, the 18 hole golf course will also be surrounded by 88 condo sites. The project is estimated to be completed by 2006 and is sure to help Grand Beach area&nbsp;become the destination resort town Manitoba needs.   Keep up to date on whats happening in the Grand Beach Area at   urlLink http://grand_beach_manitoba.blogspot.com    A new Grand Beach web site is also in the works to help promote the area to increase tourisim. We will keep you posted. If you are interested in helping out with the promotion of the area, please email me at  urlLink craigcherlet@hotmail.com    &nbsp;

       A great friend of mine stopped by for a visit yesterday. It was a welcomed reunion yesterday evening when one of my Costa Rican traveling buddies showed up in my home town. Ori and I and another 3 people spent the better part of 2 months travelling Central America. We all met in Jaco Beach in Costa Rica and became great friends. Ori was on his way back to Toronto from Mexico and he decided to say hello. We only had a few hours to hang out but it was a great chance to catch up. Hope to go and visit him out in Toronto very soon.

       The Mantario Hiking Trail is located in the Whiteshell Provincial Park in eastern Manitoba and is bordered by Ontario. Part of the trail crosses through the Mantario Wilderness Zone, an area protected from motorized access, hunting, resource extraction or development. The trail is the longest one on the Canadian Shield in Western Canada. The rugged 66km trail travels trough Precambrian rock, forest and swamp land.
