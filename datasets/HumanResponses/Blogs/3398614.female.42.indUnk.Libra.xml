      Well, tonights the nite.  My big test in criminal law.  I think I'll do alright.  All my life I've had no confidence, always afraid.  I grew up the shy-est person. I've never seen anyone like me.  I look at kids today, growing up and they're "out" and "on".  Since I can remember I've been watching the world go by and seeing other people's lives.  Now I can say, I'm staring to live.  I have my Harley to thank for that.  She's bringing be "out".  Sometimes I'm on, sometimes not.  When I'm on my beloved "Aurora" I'm always "on".  I have to be.  I love being in the moment.  I wish I can be doing more for myself these days.  I feel like I started to live later in life.  I'm now 42 with so much to do. I feel like I wasted all this time and have to make up for so much.  I'm looking for that freedom, while still being able to make a living.  I haven't found it yet, but I'm definately on a good path.  When I graduate in Dec. I'd like to freelance as a paralegal, maybe for criminal lawyers.  Work at home, do projects for lawyers.  Maybe something like that.  Today's gonna be a great day!

      Ever get that sense that you don't belong?  I mean to anything, anyone?  My great wish, most of my life was to be "in", to belong to some group, be some member of something I believe in.  Religion? I'm religious, but not to the point that I need to be active in the church.  I was brought up Catholic and some of that is still with me, but some I don't believe in.  I'm spiritual in my own way.  My m/c is my greatest pleasure!  Aurora.  She is a black Harley lowrider with apes and cool pipes!  I love how I feel riding.  It's a freedom beyond words.  I wish I could find a female riding club that want's me and I want them.  I tried riding with the DOB's but I'm not gay, so that doesn't work all the time.  I feel like a stranger among them.  It's so hard for me to feel in.  Just having friends is hard for me.  I get so shy and afraid.  I don't know why but I've been like this all my life, so I guess it's become my comfort zone.

      I've started a new medication while I'm withdrawing from another. I can't eat, have no patience and am so sad. I'm crying inside all the time. Everything is in me, it never comes out. I wish I never started with this. I have no energy, just want to sleep and cry. I want out so bad. I don't know how to release it. I want to get on my bike "Aurora", but I feel too dizzy. I just don't know where to go. I keep thinking of all the places I could go, but I still have to deal with all this. My husband doesn't understand. All he wants to do is what he wants and is going to someday not love me anymore. This happens. People stop loving and that's just the way it is. I've never known any kind of permanent love. I just wish someone or anyone would want me to belong to them. I think Aurora listens to my thoughts. I'd like to think so. I listen to her. Her rumbling, her putts, her very cool energy that she has. She feeds my soul to the max.&nbsp; I guess no one is responsible for me but me.&nbsp; I know what works for me, at least I know most of the time.&nbsp; I want to rely on me more, but I can't do it alone.  I just noticed my posting on a website was removed.
