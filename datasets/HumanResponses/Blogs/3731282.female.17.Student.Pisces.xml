      How come chinese food is only good the day that you get it - chinese leftovers suck...  mountain dew tastes like sugary horse urine..  i dont like men. Ive come to this conclusion thru trial and error.then again i dont like most women either - they tend to be chatter boxes and obsess over the stupidest shit fuck em. as for guys, what more needs to be said, most are coniving just to get into your pants. sure i date but mostly you get fucked over so i tend to be wary and untrusting. oops my bad... once again fuck em..fuck em all...  why obsess over celebrities i bet half of them ud meet you wouldnt like or have anything in common with so whats the point? focus on your own strengths not those of someone you dont even know...so singing isnt your thing, oh well worshiping justing timberlake isnt gunna make you any better at it-enjoy what they do, but as for them being your idol? HA its all bullshit...  ok and another thing on that topic, everyone wants to be famous right? nooo anyone with real intelligence understands that to be famous means giving up alot of stuff. privacy and time are two big ones. who the hell wants the world knowing their entire sex life? what about those days when you really dont want to meet with E!? yeah gimme peace and quiet any day...  Dogs are great animals, theyre not as stupid as they seem, they have a mind of their own but sacrafice it most times for the people who care for them, and they give unconditional love - what more can u ask for?  i like to play god...in anything...gimme sim city or something in which i can make my own world and i will be occupied for hours, being god is so much fun...i want my own world for real...  people are alright in small doses but when they get into a collective group or just in the masses in general problems arise, theres a group mentallity that occurs but the ones with their own minds and/or stupidity create uproar, they pick fights and create general chaos. i like to avoid that situation...  mr. rogers is NOT an educational show, it just isnt. what the hell can u learn from puppets who have names that sound like theyve lived life on skid row? they have attitude problems and dude what can an ex sniper in a faggoty sweater teach you? NOTHING! he feeds his fish and runs his gay trolley. sounds like a fun fest to me...not,i bet the military killed him put him out of his own misery...  how do you forget to tell your b/f you have herpes? like that raging bleeding stuff in your panties slips your mind? yeah right.. that was a seriously fucked up story i heard about that...  i hate writing. it takes time and energy and rarely do i write unless i have a reason to or im bored...yeah...
