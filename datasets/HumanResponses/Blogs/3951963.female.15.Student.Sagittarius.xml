      Out of all the girls i've ever loved before Out of all the other stages i've ever performed on Out of all the cities i've been to I bless the day that i found you  I bless the day i found you and that's my word There's nothing for me out there in those streets You took my heart and you set it on fire And now my love forever burns You keep taking me higher  I've been looking for love in all of the wrong places And now I finally found someone who cares for me No matter the storm it was you who helped me face it and now its safe to say that you really care for me  Just like the wings you took me flew me away yeah And now the ground is underneath my feet This man had nowhere to go then you gave me direction and now the rest of my days I can't help but give you praise  I've been looking for love in all of the wrong places And now I finally found someone who cares for me No matter the strom it was you who helped me face it and now its safe to say that you really care for me  You saw my needs, forgave my faults You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts You brought the sun into my life when my world had seemed dark, yes you did And you're the only one who was there when I needed a freind YOu're the only one who can bring me joy when there's pain in my heart  I"ve been looking for love in all of the wrong places And now I finally found someone who cares for me No matter the storm it was you helped me face it and now its safe to say that you really care for me.........                                                                               ~R Kelly  Have I?
