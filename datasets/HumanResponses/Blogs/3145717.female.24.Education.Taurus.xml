        An all-time favourite with a twist. Sink into the luscious dense pound cake and encounter the juiciness of the strawberries and the sweetness of freshly whipped cream with every orgasmic bite.

        Each bite into these bite sized squares of these sinful pleasures is filled with dark chocolate, nougat, malt and slices of mint and marshmallow. Chewy bites that are chockfull of sin that send you straight to heaven.

        Imagine morsels of not so very sweet cookie dough inundated with dark chocolate chunks. As you bite into it, the buttery cookie texture simply melts in your mouth. You savour the tantalising morsels of dark chocolate chips as it slowly melts on your tongue. You grab another, and another to satisfy that craving, that feeling of satisfaction as your teeth sink into another cookie, wanting to create that exhilirating, mind blowing experience with each Orgasmic Bite.

           I started baking just right after graduating from my Diploma in Banking and Financial Services from Singapore Polytechnic. Taking two years off studying from then, had allowed me to work and travel alot. The only peace and comfort I had was with my baking. My Baby Belling oven, how I loved that beautiful piece of equipement. I would spend my nights till 4 a.m in the morning baking chocolate chip cookies, blueberry cakes, brownies and whatever my heart fancied or whatever my brother wanted to eat. Get up at 7 am and then go off to work till 9 pm. I was stressed and depressed and my only source of escape was through the beating of sugar, butter and eggs into submission. My friends call me the Baking Dominatrix, scary nickname huh?  Anyways, when the festive season came I baked goodies for my relatives. Friends of family were asking for the goodies, and that's how there's now a following for my Orgasmic Bites. That was in Singapore..  Here I am in Perth, and lo and behold we have an oven in our wing. Started baking  a Devil's Food Cake and hadn't stopped ever since. But the all-time favourite with the residents are the chocolate chip cookies and brownies. Orgasmic Bites went big time last year at Spring Feast during Multi Cultural Week. We sold all the 20 trays of brownies: Mint, Malteser, Caramello, Dark Chocolate and Peanut Butter during the Spring Feast.  This semester I had just met an order for Cook Wing for two trays of brownies, one mint slice and the other turtle. Made a bunch for the admin and student services and they loved it. I experimented making tiramisu after that. Quite a success I must say. Comments were heard this week were as such: "Did you actually make that?", "Gosh, you've got to start up a company making sweets!!", "Woman, that was orgasmic!".....  So now here I am contemplating on what to bake next....
