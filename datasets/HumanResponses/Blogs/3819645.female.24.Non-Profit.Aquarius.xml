						   i mistook a river  where the silence is bigger when you're on your own and i won't keep it all to myself till i find that in his eyes  i'm down  and you can trust me  i saw him breathe through your lungs and you can hold me  i know it's fluent on your tongue from wading in a wonderfall from having him hold your cards from wanting of something more  than he does  would you be kind  would you be through with me would it be fine  if i threw us to the sea can you be made to be making away when i've controlled the inevitable day when she'd be offered up  with tea  and you can be sure that i'm headed back there so its a good thing you've kept your baskets full didn't close your doors and left them adoring it all till i find the way i've wanted all along and put it into my harm

						   W: I thought M: No W: I thought perhaps M: No W: you might M: not W: you might perhaps M: Stop.  Quiet please.   W: He slapped me so hard across the face, it felt as though my cheek might tear.         I thought: that'll teach him.   M: And when did we meet? W: I don't remember M: you don't remember W: where we met M: at 3pm W: I thought you didn't remember? M: where we met W: in the middle of the blue M: at 3pm W: when? M: I don't remember W: you don't remember M: I remember the blue W: I can't say that I do M: but you remember when W: of course. It was half past 4   M: I like the way you look in my hat.  Try it on.  Here. Try it on. W: It doesn't suit me. M: You didn't even see yourself W: It doesn't suit me. M: All right. W: It just doesn't suit me. M: No   W: It was one and a half days long.  And regret came in a picture show.   M: I put my hand on her knee.  She said W: My body is a temple M: on her thigh W: Or at least a well managed Anglican Youth Centre. M: She was warm. Female.   W: It never crossed your mind. M: What crossed your mind? W: I said, it never crossed your mind. M: No.  It didn't. W: And how interesting that you've no desire M: No W: no desire to see a possibility M: there was black and there was white and W: an uncertain thought M: there was gray W: I thought M: No W: perhaps M: it wasn't so gray W: you might M: it was closer to black W: than gray M: No W: it never crossed your mind M: What? No.   W: Perhaps if you could hold my hand M: I can hold your hand W: For just a minute or two M: If that’s how long W: Until this passes M: It will pass W: Don't let go of my hand just yet M: I won't W: I thought you might M: It will pass W: In just a minute or two   W: He said I was  M: perfect   M: She loved to be tickled W: but I couldn't M: She hated it W: I couldn't win him M: She would squirm and  W: I couldn't M: giggle like a child  W: pull the words from his mouth    M: her mouth would open wide W: couldn't  M: and her eyes would shut tightly W: yank a thought from his head.  A thought that wasn't there to begin with M: she threatened to pee all over the bed W: a thought that was M: said she was like a lemon W: mine M: and if I squeezed her W: my own thoughts regurgitated for M: she would surely W: my own ears M: wet the bed W: I needed more than that M: she never actually did W: didn't I M: No.  She hated it.  But she loved to be tickled W: I thought M: to laugh W: I did   M: Your words are too big for your tongue my darling.  If you're not careful your heart will burst right out                                                        of your head   W: You threw it away M: I didn't throw it away W: You threw it away dear M: I didn't throw it away darling W: You closed your eyes and let it go.  That’s throwing it away dear. M: My eyes are open darling.  I didn't throw it away W: Did you do it to get even then M: A little I think W: Well.  We're even dear M: Yes darling   W: No one else would put up with such a horrific smell. M: No.  No one would.  My lunch says we're meant to be    W: The day you brought me flowers and said it was for no good reason 					      M: for no good reason at all we drove all the way to the border just to say we had done it W: It was that night when you said that you could feel yourself falling in love with me M: and I had to carry you into the house you were so drunk.  I didn't get  W: the time you whispered in my ear because you thought I was asleep M: and I finally got that fixed.  That was a good day 			 W: That was a good day   W: I meant to be the one it had to be. M: and you are W: I thought perhaps you might see me.  As the muse for a painting, done in crayon of course.  Or the last note of a song that would resonate and leave you wanting to play it again.  I thought for you to kiss the small of my back and perhaps you might bring me to tears.  Perhaps your heart would no longer be your own. M: it is yours and you are W: I meant I was M: I meant the same   W: Nothing good ev.. M: ever happens to you I know W: I wish you wouldn't do that M: do what? you used to love that W: you love it.  You say its so cute how M: we can finish each other's sentences W: Stop interrupting me.   M: Quiet please.  There is so much noise.  You take so much energy from me. W: fix your eyes on me M: its never quiet when we don't speak W: focus please M: won't you speak so I might sleep W: wouldn't you listen to ease my mind M: lets sleep W: couldn't we just sleep M: No. Quiet please W: if we just sleep   W: Sometimes you have to ignore the price of coffee and just buy it anyway M: Like a person who comes out of the bathroom with toilet paper stuck to their shoe but everyone ignores it and goes on drinking the coffee that cost them a fortune.   W: he said M: we might W: No M: She said perhaps W: He said  M: No   W: He doesn't think its sad.  He doesn't take me seriously M: I think it’s sad W: he doesn’t get sad about anything really M: I think it’s sad W: Sadness is far too personal for that.  Too far inside to get to.  Or to share.  You could be sad and I could be sad and we would never know how deep it goes. M: I think its sad.  Like two ships passing in the night. W: That’s a stupid metaphor that leaves you free from responsibility and guilt M: I will feel guilt in time W: You will feel guilt the way a child feels guilt when a mother comes home after two weeks vacation to find that you haven't watered the plants.   M: You forget that you've forgiven me W: O yes. I'd forgotten.   M: You are a pack-rat W: and you are the paraphernalia of my life.   M: That is why I keep you   W: But perhaps M: But tomorrow is a long time from now. W: I told him.  See me somewhere else and you will know me there. M: But you never sleep.  You'll forget your intentions if you don't write them down in the earth where I can see them.   W: Your words sting almost as much as your tone M: I don't call you names W: You call me much worse M: much worse is often the case W: I have bitch in my bones M: you have bitch in your tits   W: I don't know when perfect became my favourite colour M: it snuck in W: through the backdoor M: when you hadn't had a chance W: to let it sit M: to choose red instead.   W: A thick and lonely red M:  and olive green with a black stripe in the spare room.   M: She was beautiful.  It’s hard to keep a beautiful girl W: But perhaps    M: Where did you go? W: nowhere M: you don't recall W: I don't know what you do M: were you lost just then? W: I was looking for someone M: but where did you look? W: nowhere M: simplify.  I can do the looking W: you don't owe me what you know   M: How is she so tortured W: You are magnificent. And I hate that.   W: You needn't speak.  You've nothing to say. M: I need you to hear me speak so you know what I sound  like.  So you can have me to listen to. W: But you have nothing to say. M: Yes.  So long as you heard it.   M: The good is so good. And the bad is so bad. W: Despite the racket made by my head. M: And I can only explain you emotionally. W: You exist in my heart M: In my gut.  W: In my heart M: In my gut W: There is nothing left after that. M: No

						   Darkness.   Black and somber.   Not because the Lord has yet to give light to the world, but because my eyes are closed.   I am asleep - lost in a content and incredible existence of ‘Dream’.   THE TERMINAL ILLNESS  I arrive at Millard Pharmacy at 11pm for the night shift.   The store is dark without the daylight.   Though this is my first babysitting shift, I have worked here long enough to walk the store with my eyes shut.  This is one of the few places that is continually recognizable to me.  One of the few constant familiarities that just feels easy - like a close confidant who forces me to remember where I come from and what I've been.  I wear an old pair of boxer shorts and a see-through tank top because I know I am alone - that I will be seen by no one tonight.   After a brief encounter with sleep on a tiny staff cot in the back, I wake earlier than usual, giving me plenty of time to pace the shadows of the store before light or customers arrive.  The aisles are slender, but high and packed with more merchandise than there is room for.  The stuffed shelves act as camouflage from the two large windows that line the front of the building.   The floors are cold and offer no comfort, but there is something warm about the sound of my bare feet slapping the speckled tiles.  My eyes fall on 3 large containers standing alone on one of the shelves.   Suddenly aware of my solitude, my conscience makes a run for it.  I remove one of the large jars of Nutela spread and a bag of Ruffles 3D chips from the shelves and take them to the office in the basement where I have left my knapsack.  The staircase that leads to the basement is in the centre of the store and is surrounded by a metal fence to keep the customer's children from falling in; an incident that occurred only once over four years ago to a handicap boy wearing a blindfold, but when the mother of a handicap child makes a stink, you have to smile and take a big whiff.   The bottom of the stairs is dark and full of shadows, but peaceful.   I enter the one room office, unaware of the presence in the soft leather chair behind the desk.  I find my bag on the floor and as I place the stolen items inside, I see my puppy dog.   I had not remembered that I had brought him along - in a large styrofoam cup with a couple of ice cubes in the bottom to keep him cool and a lid to keep him quiet.   He is no bigger than the palm of my hand - smaller than I remember him.   He is black.   He has big eyes that look through me and say, "you must take care of my life for I have no control" - and I feel my heart move a beat.   VISITING HOURS  I return to the store counter where I am surprised to now find another clerk.   As I approach I see that she is short with a lumpy figure and is somewhat androgynous in appearance.   She looks at me in a way that reminds me that my outfit is the kind one only wears when one is alone.   I look at her in a way that indicates my disapproval of lesbianism.  Customers have started to enter the store now at only 7am.  This alarms me somewhat, as does the lesbian's comment that the boss has been in his office all night.   Suddenly I feel an awkwardness in my stomach; several concerns creeping into my spine - the stolen food, customers who are now seeing me in my pajamas, we are working before 8am, this clerk is a lesbian.  I become sweaty with panic and run to change my garments.    After digging through the contents of my knapsack, where my dog sits patiently as he has no other choice, I put on long pants under my boxer shorts and a loose cardigan over my tank top - an ensemble that is no less embarrassing, but which reveals a little less skin.   I return to the counter where I help to serve frantic customers their morning coffee, although it is not yet daylight.      My oldest brother John is amongst the now overwhelming amount of customers.   He is much taller than I am and often used that to intimidate when we were growing up - that along with baseball bats, forks and when nothing else was in reach, an old fashioned fist - all of which led to the development of the 'supposed to love, but kind of hate you' relationship that currently stands between us.   I recognize him as my brother with a delighted smile - but he won't get a discount on his jelly donut.  Moments later – freedom - my shift has come to an end.   Released, I step out into the dark parking lot which serves each of the stores making up Acme Plaza - the Italian bakery with the two male owners who always look like they've just been released from prison, the small grocery store that is incredibly overpriced but is kept alive by the entire retirement community, the seedy bar where all the waitresses dress in tight black jeans and Budweiser T-shirts, the bank and our Pharmacy.  I set out to begin the walk home that I have taken for so many years – in the rain, in the heat  - down the main street, turn left, then right, then left again.   But the Town Square catches my eye.   At the centre or our Town Square is a gigantic castle that marks the exact middle of the country of Canada - which makes me think we should entertain more tourists than we do here, but not a major concern.   The castle is colourful and glamorous and pink - I hate pink - with white tipped towers at each corner.  It looks like a Disney cartoon.  I stare for a moment, waiting to see if My Little Pony will come out the front entrance.  She doesn’t.   It is then that I notice the sky.   An eerie colour of purple and gray and panic, has taken over behind the clouds.   The Square is full of people, all looking desperately concerned.  I am sure something uneasy is about to take place, but can't imagine what could be so wrong as to gather all of these people in one spot – and in the middle of the night.   THOSE WHO FEAR THE REAPER   Just then, we are suddenly attacked.   A storm of bombs begins to fall from the sky and dark planes fly low overhead.  High pitched whistles and the screams of young women are all I can hear behind the blasts of light.   A cold sweat begins to crawl up my skin, informing me that I am terrified.  Not that I've known much 'terror', but I imagine that it looks something like this.   I find shelter on a set of bright blue bleachers high in the air and curl up between the steps to keep myself hidden.  My mother crouches beside me on the next step up, because it is a situation where you want so badly for your mother to hold you that she does.   People are running everywhere in search of cover, but the planes continue to fly close, dropping death on many and injury on the rest.   A sharp and surprising weight in my forearm startles me and I see that several chunks of glass have lodged themselves into my skin.   I can see no blood.  I can feel nothing.   I turn to my mother and ask who is attacking us.   "Horror, dear"  she replies.   I can't help but think - where are the Americans?  They save everyone, why don't they save Canada?   They have several loyal superheroes to call upon.  In my moment of distraction, I become aware of someone's presence to my left.  On a platform next to the bleachers is my Love.   He wears a simple grin that causes me sudden panic for his safety, but we are separated by the chaos of civilians now swarming the place where he stands.  After what seems like an endless attack, the firing ceases and I join in the crowds of people now making a run for safety.   It seems that the only way down from the bleachers is a large dark waterslide.   It is green and slimy and I am sure that this slide will not be as pleasing as the one on the roof of Kmart. But the pitch blackness of the sky is now getting closer in a way that means there is no time - my mind tells my body to leap onto the half pipe before I have a chance to stop myself.   Now racing down the turns on my back, my speed increases so quickly that I have trouble slowing myself and am now colliding with the many others who have failed to slow before me.   Some are young women, grasping at the sides for their lives.   Others are young men, who are now choosing to leap into the darkness rather than risk the slimy slope.   I somehow manage to land unharmed and run from the horrific scene, though I feel strangely alone in my survival.   I make my way up the wet grass hill that edges the Town Square and pausing at this new height, it is clear just how much damage has been done.   LAST WILL & TESTIMENT  Where is my Love?   Is he a member of the chaotic mob below or has he escaped to somewhere beyond the shadows as I have?   I close my eyes.  I wonder if I can tell by my heart if he is dead or alive.   Daylight is now slowly approaching just up the street.   I walk towards it.  Making my way down the dust and debris covered road I come to a rustic looking Post Office that seems to have escaped harm.  I have no idea if the attack is finished or if perhaps these mystery bomber pilots are union members and require a 15-minute break every hour, in which case they'll be back when the coffee and cigarettes run out.   I must make an attempt to reach my Love and save him from ruin.  I find a payphone in the back corner of the store, past piles of cardboard boxes and milk crates.  I step up into the booth to dial the number that will reach my Love.   He answers.   His voice holding no fear.  No concern for life or safety.   I inform him that I am heading towards home and beg him to do the same.   But he refuses.   "I think I'll stick around here and see what happens" - an aloof tone that in the first stages of a relationship seems intriguing and mysterious and makes you want to listen to soft rock tunes, but in the current situation it makes me insane with frustration.  He does not understand the danger he is in, nor the unbearable impact it has on my stomach to think of him as gone.  I cry desperate pleas into the phone hoping to persuade him, eventually settling on the anger of not being able to.   By now a line of people has formed outside the booth - all wanting to save a soul.   The middle-aged woman behind me looks up with a painful empathy in her eyes.   It is as though she knows her Love will comply.    A WHITE LIGHT  I hang up the receiver and run out into the street where the rubble stands as evidence of the severity of the attack.  To the left is a fruit market that is mobbed with people, all trying to buy up the last of the food, as they know it will soon be hard to come by.   The further up the street I walk, the cleaner the sides of the streets become.   And the sight of clean curbs leads my thoughts to my dogs.  One of which is at home while the other is back at Millard’s Pharmacy in my knapsack.   I know that both are in trouble as they have been waiting in their styrofoam freezers for some time now.   I continue home knowing that I am helpless to the fact that one of them will likely freeze.  Until they sleep.  Until they sleep for good.  As I ascend the high, skinny staircase that leads to my safe haven, I notice a man with dark hair and kind eyes at the top.  When I reach the last step of the staircase in the town home, I fall limp with exhaustion from the climb, grasping the doorway's edge next to the dark stranger, who gives me his hand.   I am home.   Home doesn't feel safe with familiarity as I had expected.   My family is missing.   As the wind blows outside I can feel the wood paneled building easing back and forth.   Creaking with every breeze.  Reminding me I am off the ground.  And then a panic of sweat as I remember what the hurry was.   I head for the freezer to pull my baby puppy out of his cup.  The ice has melted at his back paws and he is soaked to the bone.   His eyes are shut tight and his small frail body is limp.   I pull him into my arms and reach for a towel to cover him.   He becomes blurry through the tears pooling in my eyes and I feel my heart choking as I desperately rub him back to warmth.   A beat.  And he is slowly softened.   His body begins to gain back its life.   And as one is thawed out, so is the other.   A deep breath.   There is no reason to weep.  They are not gone.   No life is lost.   GUARDIAN WINGS  Content with the renewed life of my puppies, I find a small, empty room in which to rest.   It like the rest of the home is plain and cozy and there even seems to be a hint of sunlight creeping through the lace curtains.  There is a single bed covered by a white knit blanket in the corner.   I will sleep peacefully for a night here.  I awake in the morning no longer feeling the comfort of saving my pets, and still needing something to protect.  It is then I become aware of the large sum of money in my pocket.   Three fifty dollar bills.   Crisp and untouched.   Folded once.   I decide to enlist the help of a good alliance in the protection of my money and head to the next room where Lienna, a close and honest friend, is dressing.  She is warm to my arrival but remains busy, allowing me to notice the photograph on the nightstand behind her.   I reach for it.   A pale frame that has yellowed with age holds the photo of a young and luminous girl.   Lienna.  In a beautiful white dress with light frills on the sleeves.   Her blond hair hanging loosely around her shoulders.   It was taken two hours from now at a party she will attend.   I turn to her to see that she is now wearing the dress from the photograph.  She exits in a hurry before I have a chance to tell her about the money I am clenching in my pocket - the big sister that doesn't want her little sister tagging along.   But I know by the picture that her day will hold many excitements.  It would have occurred to me that I had not been invited to the celebration for some reason, but I am interrupted in my thoughts by Lienna's mother and sister, who have just entered the room.   I am immediately unsettled.   Her mother's hair is long and coarse.   Her sister is young and looks of inherited sweetness that hides an evil behind the eyes.   They are blond and seem to float as they move.   They are dressed in glowing white nightgowns.   They are beautiful. And I feel that I should fear them above all others.  My legs press against the bed as I back away from their approach.  They are aware of the bills folded in my weak grip and move me with the obsession in their eyes.   The young one reaches for me and I let out a wail, making a fervent effort to blast them away with the power behind my lungs.  I charge them before they can do the same to me and with that they are gone. So is the money from my pocket. So is my need to keep it.   A WAKE.  A SOUL.  I have closed my eyes so that I might view the party that I am now aware I have not been invited to.   It is being held at a waterfront castle.  The castle is pink - I hate pink.   There is plush grass and trees everywhere.  Guests arrive and stroll through the gardens, mingling and posing for each other.   They are all dressed in beauty and I spot my long time best friend arriving by boat.  She too is dressed like a princess and she smiles as though she knows the world will find her stunning.   As she steps off the boat, with the help of her companion’s hand, she meets Lienna and several more of my dearest friends.   There is laughter, although I cannot tell what about.   I cannot hear exactly what they say.  It is not what is said that is important.   They have not invited me to their celebration.  But I much prefer to observe them from the invisible - it makes them the ignorant and me the silently wise.  Then I see the element that does not belong.  I see my Love.   I had forgotten that he'd stayed behind to watch the blasts, until now.   I am reminded of our last exchange and of the aching in my throat as he spoke.  Begging helplessly of him and he would not give me peace of mind.   I focus on him.   He emanates charm and charisma amongst the others.   Above the others.   “I cannot be sure what fire you hold that does so well to provoke, nor what you are made of to be so tempting.” I take a deep breath through the middle of my heart.  How terrifyingly lovely.   And just as my appetite seems to be at its very height, I find myself scanning the gardens.  For someone else to rest my eyes upon.   For a more peaceful sleep.

						    Mrs. W:  Darling?  My love, my marvelous husband, dear?  Mr. H:  Yes, dear?  Mrs. W:  Darling, I'm just terribly troubled.  Mr. H:  Well with what my dear?  Mrs. W:  Oh, won't you spend just a moment to humour me, love?  You see it's just that I'm awfully concerned with the state of our investments, dear.  Mr. H:  Oh?  Mrs. W:  And with the position of our stocks, and our future dear - I wonder if we might someday be in a position to buy a house of our very own.  Do you think our investments will get us there, love?  Oh, wouldn't you sit with me and go over these numbers darling, just to ease my mind, dear?  Mr. H:  Well absolutely sweetheart.  I'll fetch us a drink from the kitchen and then we'll sit down together, yes?  I'm having whiskey dear, now would you like the same?  Ah, no.  I know better.  My love would like something sweet.  Something with an umbrella in it or a lemon on top.  Something colourful and nice to sip.  Something that taste just like candy - I do know how my darling loves candy.  Ever since you were a little girl.  You haven't changed one bit have you - nope! Only got prettier didn't you.  Not to worry dear, I'll fix up something just right!  Mrs. W:  Oh, thank you darling, that would be lovely.  I could indeed use the night-cap.  You know it's awfully good of us to talk about these investments finally - why just today as I was listening to the radio...  Mr. H:  Uh huh, yes dear?  Mrs. W:  ... I heard a piece on a young man, no more than 26 years in age, who'd lost everything he had to the stock market.  Mr. H:  Oh, how terrible.  Mrs. W:  A good man and a decent investor they said, but he fell for a dud I suppose and that was the end of him.  And just last week as I was reading the newspaper - I can't recall now if I mentioned it - I came across a terrible story about a man just 35 years old.  Well, he was killed...  Mr. H:  killed!?  Mrs. W:  suddenly in a car accident.  And the sad part is that he hadn't had his affairs in any sort of order - well wouldn't you know it, being so young, who'd have thought it necessary at all?  Mr. H:  Well, none of us dear.  Mrs. W:  So all that man's hard earned money, his entire life's work, went straight to the bank.  Yup.  Scooped up all he was worth and his poor wife and child - now left without a penny.  Isn't it just awful darling?  Mr. H:  Oh yes.  To die so young, my goodness.  I tell you something though - I could die tomorrow knowing that I was married to the most lovely girl in the whole world!  Mrs. W:  Oh, dearest - stop.  Mr. H:  Have I told you yet today how lovely you are?  Mrs. W:  Well yes, I'm sure you have dear.  Mr. H:  Well thank Heavens for that!  Mrs. W:  Now dearest, I don't mean to harp but couldn't we just take a quick look at our banking?  Mr. H:  My darling - it's late.  Let's not waste the evening on such boring issues as these.  After all, you're too much of an  idiot  to worry about all of that.  Mrs. W:  I beg your pardon dear?  Mr. H:  I say, you're far too much of an  idiot  my love - to go on worrying your pretty head about these things.  Mrs. W:  Oh. Goodness, for a moment there I misheard - why I thought you'd said I was  beautiful .  Mr. H:  Oh heavens, darling!  How could you think such a thing.  To be called  BEAUTIFUL  by your own husband - how awful! Oh, I would never say such a thing my love.  No, what I called you was an  IDIOT , dear - an  IDIOT .  Mrs. W:  Well, thank Heavens.  For a moment I was almost insulted.  Oh, an  idiot  - what a RELIEF!

						   So what about it?  A girl has the right to live her life as she sees fit doesn't she?   So what about it then?  A girl could be a joker and a clown and a drunk all at once if she wanted to and nobody oughta say a thing about it. Or she could have a nice set of legs.  Like me.  I've got the kind of legs you feel good crossing, you know.  But if a girl's got a nice set of legs - they say she's a good for nothing sort - and don't think that very thing hasn't been said about me.  And so what about that - let 'em say all they like.  But I know that when I walk into a place on some night of the week - any night of the week - I turn the boys heads.  I turn the girls heads too!  Cause when something stuns you, you gotta look - you can't avoid turning your head - that's what's stunning about it in the first place.  And I swear, they see a girl like me with a nice, long set of legs like I got and they think I was born stunning - they think I just wake up that way.  Well, that's a laugh if I ever heard one - who simply wakes up that way?  No - stunning takes a lot of work.  It takes mornings and mid-days and evening full of tending to the details - and that's really all the difference you know - its the details.    I wear red lipstick. That's my detail. Red lipstick.  I don't wear it all the time - one needn't bother wearing such a thing as red lipstick all the time.  But when I walk into a place with red lipstick on - and I mean  wearing  it the way I wear it - well it lets everyone know that I'm not the sort of girl who gets all mousy around the boys - that's for certain.  There's not a boy in the world who intimidates me.  And that being the case - well that goes to intimidate all the girls - cause they all know that their sitting with just another boy who I'm not going to be intimidated by.   And when I walk out of a place people are thinking about how I couldn't care a thing at all about all the eyes on me and all the chatter from the couples in the corner booths.   And I'm always sure to walk out of a place.  You can't be sitting there - the last soul at the bar - if you want everyone to watch you leave, then you can't be sitting there watching folks leave themselves.  So I'm always sure to leave a place.    I'm always home at half past twelve.  That's a rule - half past twelve.  No later. No earlier.  Any earlier and I might seem a prude.  Any later and I might seem to have nowhere better to go.  And that's really the ticket to being anywhere - you always have to have somewhere better to go - that is the ticket.   And I wouldn't want to get home too late or I'd be compromising my next morning.  And I hate to compromise.  I need my entire day - every minute of it.  I am a firm believer that the anticipation and preparation for a night out is just as lovely and worth while as the night itself.   A girl enjoys setting her hair up into hot rollers as much as she enjoys showing off her curls.  Just like going to the dress shops and the shoe shops - well, it's just as fun as looking marvelous is pink.  Just like wearing your heels and stockings and nothing else while thumbing through a fashion magazine - just like that kind of fun.  Oh, I don't care much for the articles, but a girl likes to see what all the fashion models are wearing.  And how they're wearing it too.  You know, what your wearing is only as stunning as how you're wearing it - and that's a rule.  And when I walk into a place wearing the heck out of something - well I'm ready for anything.    Except maybe looking for love like the rest of the girls.  That's not something I'd make a point of being ready for.  I might be looking for love sometimes, on some nights out - when the boys are really being sweet and the music is really sounding moody.  Maybe some of those nights I'm looking.  I don't want to find it though.  No, I don't want to find anything.  I've found love a couple of times - a girl should find love at least a couple of times you know - but it just didn't suit me the way looking for it did.  So, I'm looking for it.   But I'm always sure to go home alone.  A girl has to be able see herself in and out of a place without requiring an escort - that's a rule.  And she has to know better than the boys when it's time to see herself out of a place.  No, I prefer to come home alone.  And I prefer not to take off my lipstick when I get there either.  I've got a great big white duvet, but so what about it.  I just go right on wearing my red lipstick straight through the night.  A girl has got to be able to wear lipstick where and when she pleases.  That's a rule.

						     Mrs. Green:   No. I don't believe I will come with you to the shops today, dear.  I simply haven't the taste for it today.   Mrs. White:   Oh?  Well why on earth not Mrs. Green?  This is entirely unexpected as it is an entirely lovely day outside.   Mrs. Green:    I simply can't stand to be out at the shops today, dear.  I believe I've something better in mind actually.   Mrs. White:   Oh? And what might that be Mrs. Green?! Oh, how I do LOVE an adventure of some sort!   Mrs. Green:   Well dear, I believe I just might make my way to Gramercy Park...   Mrs. White:   yeessss.   Mrs. Green:   ... and I'll find myself a nice quiet bench to sit on while I starve myself.   Mrs. White:   Oh my, Mrs Green that DOES sound marvelous doesn't it!  How I would LOVE to join you.  You wouldn't mind the company, would you?   Mrs. Green:   Why not in the least, dear.  I always find it's much easier to starve in twos - don't you agree? Much easier to waste the time together.   Mrs. White:   How right you are!  Shall I pack some of my husbands razors to take along?   Mrs. Green:   Well, what ever would you do that for, dear?   Mrs. White:   Why, so we might slit our wrist together Mrs. Green.  After we've starved ourselves thin enough, of course.  No one wants to die a WHALE!   Mrs. Green:   Oh! Of course not! How hideous that would be - to die a huge fat blubbering WHALE!   Yes, lets starve ourselves thin enough and then slits our wrists with your husband's razors - I think that sounds best.   Mrs. White:   Agreed!  I best pack a hair brush for each of us as well then, and perhaps some iodine so as not to make a mess of our Sunday best.   Mrs. Green:   Oh, that's a fine idea.  I would hate for this dress to ruin.  You know I paid all of 10 cents for it just two short weeks ago.  I would simply hate for it to be ruined for no reason at all.  Afterall, it did cost 10 cents like I said and I can't bare to through money away.  Its just so silly isn't it?   Mrs. White:   It would be very silly - to ruin our fine dresses.  Let me bring along some serviettes as well then, just to be safe.  Better safe than sorry - that's what my mother always said - and my mother was never wrong.   Mrs. Green:   Oh yes dear, much better to be safe than sorry.  I believe our mothers might have had that in common.  Now we must be on our way dear, if we'd like to be done by sundown, so let's hop too.   Mrs. White:   Well, why on earth must we be done by sundown dear - Gramercy Park is just lovely after sundown - the evenings are much more peaceful than the busy afternoons - don't you agree?   Mrs. Green:   Well now, you don't want our poor bodies to be lying in Gramercy Park after evening, dear!  Why there's no telling what kind of riff-raff might find us there.  There is no telling how they might have their way with two VERY attractive ladies in two VERY fine dresses, such as we are.   Mrs. White:   Oh my, that would be terrible - for two such perfectly thin and handsomely dressed women to be taken advantage of.  How silly of me not to think of it - you're absolutley right Mrs. Green.   Mrs. Green:   Yes, it's best if we're all done before sundown, dear.  That will allow plenty of time for a nice handsome couple to discover us and get things taken care of politely - don't you agree?   Mrs. White:   Oh, yes.  Perhaps that marvelous couple from 3D who like to walk their newborn after six.  That would be just lovely - to be found by such lovely people.   Mrs. Green:   Well now, how do you suppose I should fix my hair then?  Shall I wear it up since you'll be wearing yours down?   Mrs. White:   Oh yes, please do Mrs. Green.  I would hate for us to be confused.   Mrs. Green:   Oh, wouldn't that be just awful dear - to be confused for one another - or worse, to be thought of twins?!   Mrs. White:   Oh my!  My Goodness - you best fix your hair up then, I must agree.  Twins! - what a confusion that would cause!   Mrs. Green:   It would seem we have all we need then, dear.  Let's be on our way now - no need to waste the day - I hate to waste the day - it's such a silly thing to do.   Mrs. White:   I'll be along in just a moment Mrs. Green - I've GOT to fetch some sunscreen - it would be so silly not to have sunscreen on a day like this!

						   She will tire of him.  I can tell.   She'll become bored.  She may even be bored of him already - as I think it.  Even from three rows back on the trolley - it is obvious what's going on here. Even as they boarded - he was quick to offer her to sit down first, nearest to the window.  But the young lady replied with a sour face "No - let's not sit down there, we'll move a little further to the back." The young man backed up to the next set of seats and again offered her the one nearest to the window - which the young lady of course refused. It was obvious right from the start what was going on here.  Even now, as he sits beside her, reading aloud from a heavy paperback - glancing at her every other sentence to see that she is listening - even now - she is on her way to certain boredom. Teetering on the edge for the moment, but clearly on her way.  I must admit - when I myself first heard the young man's voice as he read aloud - I thought - how wonderful.  How lovely and how sweet and how old-fashioned.  But after only a few moments of hearing it - I wish for a giant fist of violence to crush through the roof of the trolley car, smashing the young man to the ground.  I want silence and to be lost in my own thoughts again.  But he won't have it.  Not for me - or for the young lady next to him.  He reads on.  Something about the Germans and something about an older gentleman and I heard some mention of a treehouse.  She will become bored though.  I can tell - because her hair is a perfect red - the kind that always looks red, no matter the lighting - as though she has come from the salon each and every morning. And she has curls.  Not natural curls.  Perfect curls.  The kind of curls women carefully craft with their dryers and irons and styling sprays.  She has sculpted herself for an evening of romance.  She has prepared herself to be adored.  And from three seats back - I must assume that on occasion she is satisfied. Because every few moments, the hand on her shoulder give her bare arm a soft stroke - or pulls her in just slightly.   But more often, the young man's hand is too busy making gestures to animate the story - pointing and waving and sometimes leaving her completely to turn the page.   His voice is deep and firm and very quietly I can hear him saying, "Listen to me - let me read aloud to you on the trolley - and pay no mind to those who sit three rows back and saw through the back of our heads with their eyes!" Which only makes me feel desperate to call back to him, "SHE HATES YOU - YOU FOOL! And your story is STUPID!"  But I am not as boldly impolite as I have always hoped to be.  At one point the trolley comes to a complete stop.  "Forest Park" calls the driver.  The back doors in front of the novel-totting lovers opens to release a middle-aged man, who steals one last glimpse of the young lady who will become bored, as he exits.  A horn from a passing car blows loudly as it speeds ahead of the middle-aged man - startling and nearly smacking him off of his feet.  The lovers take notice. The young man's head just fits outside the window - enough to holler to the driver of the speeding car, "You STOP when the trolley does, you don't BLOW your HORN!"  And he slams the window shut with the kind of sickening pride that makes you want to swallow a bees nest and throw it up into someone's face.     Even from three rows back I hate the young man.  His hair is lazy and his beard is full and his voice is booming.  I can see her head is tipped to one side - she is a thinker - she is a dreamer.  She is seeking to be romanced and adored.  And the young man whom I hate for his goodness - is lost in his efforts.  And her perfect curls - perfectly wasted curls. He hasn't even noticed the young lady has worn lipstick.  The young man's reading is cut short as the young lady peaks out the window.  "Here comes our stop" - she is sounding ever so pleased.  The young man stuffs the novel into his bag to catch up to the young lady who is already poised at the door, awaiting the fresh air.  The trolley stops.  I watch as the couple steps off.  I am next to de-board and take my post at the doors just as the trolley starts up again.   Out the window I can hear their voices.  "We've gotten off a stop too early" - the annoyance in the young lady's voice is now painfully sharp.  The young man is completely oblivious.  He sighs, "Well.  We'll just take a bit of a walk then."  She may even be bored of him already.
