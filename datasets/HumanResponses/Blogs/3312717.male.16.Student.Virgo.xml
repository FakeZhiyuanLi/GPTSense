      Question for Mattson: How long does it take you to write your page and a half blogs  I'm really not going to go crazy and kill a bunch of people, it's just not my style.  If people tried real hard to find the real me, the me behind the mask, then you would know.  It's a forgive and forget world, with a little regret and revenge mixed in.  You can't hold a grudge against everyone who does something to you anyway.  Otherwise I'd end up sending a lot of people mail with anthrax in it or something.    There are two reasons that I do weird things: 1) It's just who I am and 2) it makes me stand out.  If I wasn't just a little weird I'd be an average boring kid who gets good grades and isn't cared about, otherwise a John.    You guys don't even really know how weird I am either.  Ever since I moved here in 6th grade I've been keeping mostly to myself.  I was, and still am, a shy kid who doesn't really speak out much.  I started as a prickly cactus, but now I'm like an unblossomed tulip.  I'm approachable but not open.  My weirdness now is like long lake compared to lake superior.  Get what I mean?  Memorial weekend sucked. Rain. Cold. Still no car yet. Drivers test in 2 weeks or so. Phone #: 829-3791

      O man... I hope your mom still isn't mad about the burning shit incident. Hopefully she isn't because then things will probably run smoothly.

      Maybe it is the Hobster....  Anyway, I guess my grandma decided to up and take a road trip. So she won't be here this week. My crazy mom is in charge.   About Tuesday: I don't know. I want to buy a bunch of stuff off Interpunk, but that could wait another week. If we do go, I know I would have to drive, because lets face it, you suck at driving.

      First of all, I went to Ginny's party for about 4 hours. You can't judge those people because you don't know any of them. For example, when you first meet Chris, you think he is very dumb. Then, once you get to know him, you realize he isn't stupid, he just lacks any form of common sense. Some of them are assholes though, but some of them are cool. In addition, I don't only care about what people think of me. Just because I don't go act like a jackass doesn't mean I only care about what people think of me. Plus, some of the juniors are cool. I don't see why you dislike them so much. And I never really got invited to go to the concert Friday so, why not go play XBOX with the juniors?  Tuesday: St. Cloud? I think we should definately go. Not only would it be the farthest driving trip for me (and Mattson???), but it would be fun. Plus, we will have just got paid by "Grandma." Who else can come?

      John, you  are  a sellout. One only needs to look at the pictures on Chris Derby's blog. Hanging out at Ginny's house while your real friends are frolicking in the park. No doubt your fake plastic friends are much more interesting than us, anyway.   Did you lie to Chris Derby when he asked you if you were posting the comments on his blog?  P.S. John: I messed up one of the song names on that mix. Instead of  Brian's Lament  by the Souls, that should be  We're coming back . Thanks.

      Actually, I didn't go to the party because I never wanted to go. In fact, I only agreed to go because Chris bitched about it at me for four hours. Then, I decided I didn't want to go, and Bryce really didn't want to go either. Chris called Hobie and asked him to come play afterwards, not me. I was sick of playing Halo. (But it is unthinkable that you would come hang out with us when you could be hanging out with your real junior friends that invite you to do non-Xbox stuff all the time.) I've guess I've made it obvious that I don't like some of the juniors.   (To the Jetpack and John)  I don't really know what to say about the punk thing. I don't really care anymore what you think it is. You have no idea about it, and anything you and the juniors decide together is bullshit anyway. Punk is a feeling, a belief, a way of life. You don't have to act or dress a certain way to be a punk. The Oselands are punks, but Schilling is also kind of a punk too for refusing to believe Darwin's theories, even though the vast majority of the scientific community think he is right. One aspect of punk is refusing to accept the status quo. I don't need or seek your validation of my punkness.   "Punk is a reflection of what it means to be human. Punk is: the personal expression of uniqueness that comes from the experiences of growing up in touch with our human ability to reason and ask questions." -Greg Graffin   I am not a punk elitest. In fact, I accept a lot of the people I know as punks. Some people are punks, and they don't even know it. Take Bryce, for example. He doesn't care what people think of him, and he finds his own path in life. The reason I call those kids at school psuedopunks is because that is what they are. They are just striking out because no one will accept them as real people. They don't understand the difference between being a social outcast and a punk. You can not walk into a Hot Topic, buy a T-shirt, and become a punk.  Punks find their own truth. Punks say what they believe and stand up for it. In the end, punk is something too pure for you to accept. That is okay with me. But don't try and destroy the way I live because you are unsure about your own lives.  If you think I am a hypocrite, then tell me so. I can take it.   In conclusion, fuck you both. I don't have to go suck up to the juniors whenever you feel the need to, and I don't have to put up with your bullshit either. All you two care about is what people think about you, and don't even try to disagree with me because it is obvious and other people agree with me.   Are we cool now? If you still have some sort of grudge against me I would be glad to hear it. I'm glad you said something instead of keeping it inside.  Now that that has been resolved:  Chris, Erik, Bryce, and I did a bunch of stuff that started Thursday afternoon and ended about an hour ago. I was going to recap it all, but this post is going to be bloated enough as it is, so I'll just say we had fun. (One thing: Erik's band played a show last night and the new CD's out on Tuesday.)  Got some new shoes. They rock. They rock hard.  Can you believe that the school year is over already? I learned almost nothing in actual school but I learned tons in social interaction and about how people tick. In two weeks, the facts will be gone from my head but the lessons about life will stay forever. So, here is my year in review.  September: sucked April: sucked really bad All the other months: not too bad Best CDs I heard all year: Operation Ivy's  Energy  and Minor Threat's  Complete Discography  Still the Greatest CD ever made: Bad Religion's  No Control  Favorite Books:  Cat's Cradle, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  Favorite Class: TV Pro! Favorite Teachers: Mr. Lade and Mr. Wanninger Was the year better than I expected? Yeah If I could go back to the beginning of the year, what would I tell myself? Josh, you wasted a whole year on schoolwork. Never work hard in school again because it is not worth it and doesn't have any tangible rewards. Attendance record: Downright respectable, for the first time ever I can't believe that: I'm sixteen now. Man, soon I'll be old. Who I had the most fun with: For the tenth year in a row, the Oselands Who has more street cred, Chris or Erik? Chris does whatever he wants but Erik plays in a band. I'd say tie. But last year Erik had more so maybe the tables are turning. Biggest asshole I know: Goat Best song to blare out of your speakers: TSOL's  Code Blue  The one person I will deride until the end of time: Schilling. He has the worst music taste ever, no sense of humor,  and  he is a crazy fascist. He fulfills all three points of the jackass trifecta. Even the Hobster only hits two of those. Weirdness award goes to: Hawkeye. Someday he is going to flip out and kill us all. He needs to chill out. Biggest asshole I know, part two: Chris Derby Number of car accidents I had: Too many At this rate I expect to be mature in: 23 years Biggest Pedophile: Scott Bock Number of times I skipped Chemistry: 4  Number of times I wanted to skip Chemistry: ...however many days were in the second semester New phrases:  Guard Dogs, Sellout  Still the reigning king of all words:  Booglarize  The catchiest tune I've ever heard: Lamb Effect's  Homeless Man  My new driving music is: Ska, reggae, hardcore, and punk Magazines I read:  Spin  Websites I couldn't live without: www.punknews.org www.nationstates.net www.tompaine.com www.americanprogress.org www.m-w.com www.blogger.com Things that I hate more intensely than when school started: emo, posers, intellectuals who think that they are better than everyone else One book everyone should read:  Fast Food Nation  Biggest Asshole I know, part three: The collective junior class, sans Tom and David You should work on your: spelling and grammar Number of "emo" moments I had this year: Almost none. Well, none that were too major.  A kid that everyone likes: Nate Lucas A kid that everyone hates: Alex Proctor, the G.G. Allin of BHS Number of pictures I took/things I taped: Tons. I've got a lot of visual documentation that I exist, the first time ever to happen Who changed the most: Everyone changed too much. I fear change. I fear and loathe it. I really hate it when: I say something and people think I misspoke and make fun of me New friends I made: I made a ton. I might have doubled my friends/acquaintances, which I'll attribute to TV Pro. I went to a show in Pequot last night and I knew pretty much everyone there. That was eerie. Who I'll miss: Hannah and Kali. And Nate Lucas. But mostly Hannah and Kali. Even though they constantly plotted against me, pegged me as a uptight, bitter old man, and totally missed who I am, they were cool. I miss them already. Will next year be better? I dunno.  In short, this year had its highs and lows, like every year.   To my friends: you need to loosen up. School isn't that important, and you are all going to go crazy by the time you are 20. Don't worry about what people think about you. Do what you want, and remember that just because someone is older than you, doesn't mean they are wiser. Have a good summer.

      Also last night, Hobie acted dumb for a while. All Jarid, PK and I did was switch teams for a round. He then busts into our room and starts punching us. He also kept making comments about "hot butt sex." Very gross. The funniest thing I heard though was when Hobie came in our room one time and PK said, "Is it just me, or did it just get fatter in here?" Extremely PK, but extremely funny also.

      Well, last night after the XBOXing died down we had an interesting conversation about about being punk. In the end, we even gave punk a new name, Josh Mattson. As in, that shirt is Josh Mattson. After that, it was decided that Josh Mattson isn't very Josh Mattson. Then, we went on to talk about the emo side of counter culture and then on to things we hate in general. A very funny conversation.  Once again, my theory that Mattson ruins everything. First, he is coming to the party late. Then, he doesn't even come at all. Finally, he asks if we are going to stop and play with them after the party... That just sucks. And  he  calls  me  a sellout.

      Since I got home very late last night, I couldn't post about how I saw Coach Thompson riding his motorcycle. But I did. And it was awesome. Furthermore, I've been scheduled Wednesday night to work... I'm prolly gonna miss the tennis thing since, of course, our captains, namely Peet, couldn't get their (his) act together.

      God, Mattson. You ruin everything. Just got done watching RotK... 200 minutes and finally it ended. That is sooo long. Ok, 193 minutes of school left... I couldn't even watch the movie in that amount of time, so that is good.

      I must say, despite the amounts of fun I had playing football and doing about nothing constructive for hours after school, the best part of my day was again seeing that guy who looks like Keanu Reeves at Subway. The first and only time I'd seen him before, he was walking out of Franklin while we waited in front of it for tennis. I was stunned to see him, then about five seconds later we watched as a squirrel got scared and changed trajectories in mid-air, a move out of "The Matrix." It was all too much to be a coincidence. I also remember jumping up to that tree and going for a pull-up only to see Willie in the window shaking his head at me.  Everybody's working for the weekend. Or at least I am, a nice 17 1/2 hours of it... I'd prefer the Halo-fest not be Saturday or Sunday. This is gonna be a good summer - I'ma work hard, I'ma play hard.  I'm 18 points in Chemistry away from pulling off another succession in a chain of straight A honor rolls as far back as recorded history of my life stretches, and it should be easily attainable given the 40-point-ness of the final.

      Actually, I just drove that direction so I could see what you guys would do. Also, Chris Derby's new blog is http://brainerdseniorhighschool.blogspot.com . Just thought I would post that because Mattson was wondering why he stopped posting. It is fun to leave anonymous comments there... Worms... What a strange game...   Anyways, back to Goat Strategy. In order to find out how to most effectively kill a goat I searched on Google for 'How to kill a goat.' I found this handy list http://www.capcas.com/50%20Ways%20to%20Kill%20a%20Goat.html . Although there really are only 34 ways, there are some important messages in here. "12. Let the goats into the corn bin." That one there obviously is very pertinent to HALO. What it means is "If you want to kill Goat, let him get into your flag base in Blood Gulch then blow the hell out of him." Here is an even more obvious one: "27. Run a panicked kid over with a 4 wheeler or a car." Obviously this is talking about us 'Hogging it up. Another good is here: "19. Drop a 1500 pound bale of hay on a goat." What this means is U.S. Bomb that baaaaaahhhitch.   Obviously, there are going to be more than one way to skin a Goat, but those are some of the more common ones 'cause they were on Google. Personally, my favorite will be the shotgun to the face. Nothing is more satisfying than seeing a blob of Goat lying on the ground after being shot with a high powered shotgun. Not only do you have the advantage of being close to him when he is dead, you can also easily squat him.

      Oi! Nutters!  Today was kinda fun and kinda sad. The only significant thing that happened during school was that it was the last day of TV Pro. I had to do a camera because there were not enough cameras, and it was chaos. Cords everywhere, things screwing up, etc. I realized that I probably won't see almost all of the TV Pro people again, and that was sad. There are only a few of us coming back next year.   Tomorrow is the last day of school, and I am seriously considering skipping hours 4/5. Nothing is happening, and I don't really want to get up early.  After school we went and played hackey sack and football in the park. That was fun.   Joe is having an all-night barbecue, which is going to suck for him if it rains. I'll probably go by there tomorrow morning and check out how he's doing.  Haven't seen the Hobster for a while. I wonder how things are goin' with him.  I'm going to pick up Chris after school, and we'll probably have fun.   I am going to shoot off the remainder of my pictures tomorrow.  So today I was bringing Houley home, and all of a sudden we see John. Naturally, we wonder where the hell John is going, because he said he was going home. So we follow him for a while, and he finds out that we were following him and stops at Houley's house. So I don't know where he was going, but I have a pretty damn good idea.  I'll probably post something longer tomorrow or Friday.  Until then.

      One day left. Yeah, alright. Book burning party at Mattsons. Then, one of the other parties that will be around town on that day. Hopefully one that Tay or Schilling won't be at because they are both the biggest jackasses in the world.   Now Jason and Mattson are off to play Madden. I hate Madden but for some reason I own it. In other news, Goat show down will be sometime soon. If you hear some baaahs of anguish, then you will know it is because Team Goat got their asses kicked. And that will happen so prepare yourself for the baaahs.

      (Josh's Note: Sorry about the editing Houley. But yours is at the top now. EVERYONE SEND ME THEIR YEAR END RETROSPECTIVE NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW!!!!!)  Houley has decided that for today he will be the helper mummy.  This one's short because I gotta go to bed. Don't laugh; my last two mornings were rise and shine at 5:30, pitiful for the last week of school. I'm just glad Travica's deadset on playing through his injuries tomorrow so I don't have to fill in and do the whole thing again. Why Alexandria? I'll tell you why NOT: 1) It's stupid. 2) It's got the worst weather of about anywhere, even like Neptune. 3) It's not even close to centrally located. We're playing  Bemidji  for crying out loud.  Which leads to my helping... To italicize, simply type what you want itaclicized, then highlight and push the slanty I at the top of the window. It'll surround your word with html... it works. Also, in blogger news, there's something very new about "Photoblogging." That oughta help. Lastly, Hawkeye oughta rock at Halo, especially if El Jefe did so well as he did on no previous playing experience.  As for my books, I've gotten into a sort of classic sci-fi rut of types. I've checked out a bunch of Heinlein, which I'm bound to read all day tomorrow, and looking for Vonnegut, who sounds really awesome. Fantasy was great, but George R. R. Martin's just not cutting it for me, don't ask me why. I'll still read Wheel of Time, of course. I'm morally and, in Massachusetts and Nevada, legally obligated to finish out the series, no matter how hard the man tries to light it up like the Hindenberg. It's just nice to be able to read for pleasure without APUSH crammed down my throat.  My most starkly conservative aspect is my overwhelming distaste for activist judges... or at least, that's the one that's come to mind.  Some trivia for you poor souls. Don't cheat, or you'll feel hollow. Don't tell anyone if you know the answer, or you'll contribute to their hollowness. I worked on this one many hours, but after solving it, it rewarded me with a sick sense of accomplishment like I've never felt in my life: What is the longest single-syllable word in the English language? To let you know when you're donesky, as well as to torture you further, the word is NINE (9) letters long. Best of luck.  And I'm spent.

      Happy Tuesday.  Played some Halo today. I didn't really feel like playing but I hate being called a mediocre player, so I went to protect my Halo honor.  You know, the reason I get 10-20 less kills per game than David and John some games is because they usually play on the so-called "good" team. I usually play on the team with the most people, which means 1/2 to 2/3 of them suck. Which equates to easier kills for them and the Hobster. I was playing against Jake, David, and John today, and I had to work for my kills, whereas 1/2 of my team sucked and were gimmes for them.  Speaking on Halo, we plan to implement phase two of our Halo rivalry, namely a flaming bag of poop on my mom's doorstep, on Thursday. If there need be a step three, Jarid has volunteered to supply us with some fireworks.   Turns out on Friday John wasn't going to eat with his grandparents, like he claimed. Although after he left everyone pretty much agreed that he was going to hang out with Pammy.   I'm done cutting up the Joe Day concert. It seems that the second song just walked off and left, which really sucks. But it is 20 minutes long and I got some good Chris/Chris footage for my documentary.   The end of school, like every year, seems anticlimactic. I mean, the same thing goes down every year. I suppose some people are graduating who I'll probably never see again. God, I hope I won't be so weepy when our senior year gets over. I probably won't. I don't like the majority of the sophomores.   There are six people that can blog here, and Hobe hasn't even blogged once. I understand, what with the tennis and the getting rocked and whatnot. But there is no excuse for everyone else to not do it if Houley can. He is like the busiest person in Brainerd.   I've gotta replace my chemistry book. That looks to be setting my dad back 50 bucks. It is a bunch of garbage, because I'm pretty sure that book was almost unusable when I got it.  Tomorrow is the last day of TV Pro and German. I've had Frau Wied for three years now, and I think she is a good teacher. I don't really care about German ending, though. On the other hand, I'm going to miss all the people from TV Pro. Some of them are even my friends (though I'd hate to admit to Hannah and Kali that I will miss them). Next year's class is going to be much less talented than this year. But more about that when I'm in a different mood, I think.  I've decided that Chris Derby is the Flexo to my Bender. Yes, I bet Hobie is the only person in Brainerd who understood that. We are similar, yet he seems to have decended into full-blown assholery while I am still back on jerk. We're two sides of the same unbalanced coin.  I didn't have anything to write about tonight. Maybe tomorrow I will write about something interesting. May your everloving soul bounce on.

      Hey guys, sorry I haven't had time to post much.  I also don't really have anything to say so maybe you don't want me to just babble on. Any way, I'm in Career investigations right now so this will be short. My weekend wasn't that great with the wedding and such. I guess I don't really know what's going to happen the next two nights because anything can happen when you're riding with Mattson.  It's like the magic school bus except it's not yellow, or that big, or that long, or that quiet, or that clean. . .it's not like the magic school bus at all if you think about it.  It's more like a screaming wagon of doom. I guess I should go to a Halo-fest some time, dispite my dislike of the X-box.  Probably this summer some time: I just need a good teacher.  I should be able to learn fast since I started playing video games at age 5.  I'll blog later

      Today was an inconsequential day, with nothing important happening, and only one thing that was funny enough to mark.   Hey, I'm done with Chemistry, and I did suprisingly well on the final test. The true final isn't until Thursday, but that is just busywork.  Me and John went to the Bookstore and the Salvation Army after school today. I got the new Spin (the price was raised from 3.50 to 4 dollars, which sucks), and I got a brand new copy of the Autobiography of Malcolm X for 35 cents. That rocked, because my copy was lost years ago one time when I moved. John kept trying to surreptiously make me listen to "Iron Man," which I would have no part of.   I'm thinking about expanding the Joe Day concert into a full-blown documentary thing, but I won't have enough time to finish it before school ends and Joe is getting antsy for it. Plus, I've already got a documentary-type thing going on this summer. It's kinda a vanity thing where I just tape stuff and take a bunch of pictures. I already started, and I think I'm going to use some of the stuff I taped before the concert on Friday that won't make it onto Joe's concert tape.   John and I took the Goat Halo match one step further today. We went to my mom's to deliver the message that we accepted the challenge, and found no one home. So I wrote down the message, and John had a great idea. I took a knife, walked over to the mail, and stabbed the message to a package with the knife. It looked really funny, and I bet it annoyed the hell out of my mom.   I got the Minor Threat complete discography this weekend, and I like it a lot. I don't know why, but I've been gravitating towards hardcore more lately.   What is up with no one blogging? Come on. I know you have longer attention spans than me.  Saw Chris Derby at the show on Saturday. He kinda grated on me, and even Chris picked up on what his deal is. Every time I see him, I just want to tell him that existentialism is total bullshit, and how you put your name to your religion isn't as important as he makes it out to be.  Tomorrow is the last full day of school.  I'm still doing the year end review thing. I really wish you'd email me yours. I'm hoping to post them all on Friday, and I'll bother you all about it for the next few days. Make them about whatever you want. The people you met, movies you saw, stories you heard, fun you had, books you read, anything. Make them as personal or as boring as you want. I don't think you guys realize that you can type whatever you want in this white space, and it can be as self-serving and mundane as you want. Make them long, and have fun. But please do them. Email them to me at badreligion015@hotmail.com. Thanks. P.S.: Don't tell anyone what yours is going to be about so they are all different.  Speaking of books, I borrowed some good ones from the Hobster. I am reading Guns, Germs and Steel right now, and I think it is very interesting. I am also reading this sci-fi book I picked at random off Dan's shelf and it is so-so. I'll read it though, because every other book I have borrowed from there has been good. I usually read a fiction and a non-fiction book at the same time, and I usually go through the non-fiction faster.   Man, that poem we read in English was awesome. It creeped me out sufficently enough to enjoy trying to understand it.   The Casualties are on Warped Tour this year. Man, I can't even begin to think about how long Chris and Erik will go on about that. You should have heard the "Guard Dogs" jokes they were shouting on Saturday night.  In case you haven't noticed, I like to progress from the mundane to the personal on here.   On Sunday night, I was watching the Simpsons, and it struck me that the Simpsons is really becoming overly partisan. Not just Bush-hating, but dealing with real issues like massive corporate media takeovers. But anyway, there was this part where a teenager walks up to a cliff, yells, "Why did you cancel Futurama?", and jumps off the cliff. I, of course, thought of Hobie, and I laughed so hard I fell off the bed. It was the most perfect moment, because I laughed until it made me happy. For a few seconds, I felt invincible. But it was special to me because it felt like innocent unforced humor, something that you don't encounter normally in the halls of BHS.   My mom just called me. In retrospect, the knife thing was goddamn hilarious. My mom said they took some pictures and stuff to prove that I am nuts like they've always suspected.  Can someone find out how to use italics on this? And put in pictures? I've been trying to figure out how for a while now.  Until later.

      Well, again, good luck to the Warrior tennis team at sections...  Awaking at 5:30, I make it to school around 6:35. I'm amazed at how light out it is, and how a bunch of people are already showing up for earlybirds. I'm not tired enough to get more sleep, so we play a bunch of cards on the way down. Driving by Discovery Middle School in Alex, I see the time is 8:19.  The guys are just getting ready to say the Pledge, and we're already in Alex.  We eat at McDonalds, since I guess we're corporate whores, no pun intended with whatever Stanek said at that same spot. I got a large cappucino. It sort of woke me up, and tasted good, but it was hot, which I didn't want at the time. Upon getting back to Discovery, we stepped out and saw our breath. Yeah, it's the 24th of May... We hit some balls and warmed up and all, then met our opponenets. Heading to our courts, I feel drops of water.  Ah, crap.  We head to the High School and wait no less than three hours while individuals are seeded for Wednesday. During this time, we slowly degraded from watching "Holes" on the bus to exploring the school, to playing check, then fooling around in their indoor batting cages, followed by a game of basketball using tennis balls, which shortly turned into standing at opposite ends of the gym and whipping the balls across William Tell style, although whenever the balls  did  get close enough to make contact, we'd just move anyways. The ride back was a morose affair of sleepiness and partial watching of "Dragonfly," coupled with soreness from the seats and the small charlie horse I contracted during a coughing fit around 2 am. This was subsequently followed by me rushing up to Chemistry in the nick of time to absolutely bomb the organic chem test. I banked on C-O-C being ether, and pulled that one off, but I only knew alcohol and carboxylic acid outside that one, so I did extremely poor. I'm hoping the final will push my grade through at an A-level.  The Halo tourney sounds like fun; however, I foresee us getting pounded. Especially in the case of team slayer, in which it would be 5 highly-experienced players against about 3 experienced players, 2 fairly good players, and 3 chickens with their heads cut off (myself and the oselands), and this is given that the player TBN isn't worse than Kraus. Capture the Flag would be much more even... although I'm still scared even of this. We'd require an excellent defensive-maneuver player, being that we have 3 good snipers in Driller, Johnny, Holby, a few crazy flag-attack freelancers in myself and Kraus, and a more organized and methodical attack system formed of the snipers, Eric, and Mattson. Unless we can stake out a defense around the base, we need someone good in close quarters, and who is willing to take on guard duty.  In conclusion, for those of you who read my dissertation back on NationStates about Meowtopia not needing military or space programs since these are world-wide ideas, only needed to be undertaken by the number one in the world, the U.S., I've found a nice quote that sums up basically what I was saying.   "I wish that all Americans would realize that American politics is world politics." -Theodore Roosevelt

      It's been a few days, but I've been busy.  For a quick recap: On Friday I played some Halo at the Oselands. We had some fun, watched some G.G. Allin, and everyone left feeling that their Halo habit wasn't quite fed yet.   On Saturday, I woke up unusually early. I got up at 8:30, and I felt really horrible. We had plans to go down to the show later on, but first we putzed around Brainerd for a while, I called Erik a "corporate whore" for eating at McDonalds, and then we went to my moms. When Goat found out that we had been playing Halo, he foolishly boasted that him and four of his best Goat buddies could defeat me and seven of my Halo-playing companions. That's right, 5 vs. 8. Which sent me, Chris, and Erik into paroxyms of laughter, and I agreed that our team would would destroy their team at a time of our convenience. Oh, and another thing- he wouldn't talk to us. He sat there with a smug look on his countenance while my mom (he is thirty-something years old and he is having his wife challenge a bunch of kids to a video-game match) conveyed his ill-thought out challenge.   But it isn't just Halo.  It is me vs. Goat, young vs. old, right vs. wrong. I won't claim to be right 100 percent of the time we argued, but it must have been at least 99.97564 percent.   It is about the future, the next generation, knocking over the complacent who are arrogant in their age, who think that just because they are older, they know more.  We are free of the prejudices and doubts of our elders, and I intend to prove that when I pick up my S-Controller and kick the bejesus out of Team Goat. It is time for them to step aside for us.  Maybe you are reading too much into a video game, you say. Maybe I am. But anyway, here is what I am thinking for the roster: Myself Chris  Erik  John  Hobe David Miller (the alleged "Driller") Houley and one more who I haven't decided on. I'm not sure who is the next best. But some people on the list are on it because they also deserve a chance to humiliate the Goat, like the Oselands.   After the asinine challenge was handed to us, we went out back and started jumping on my sister's trampoline. She ordered us to get off, and I yelled, "We don't need your fascist trampoline anyway, Bailey!"  I'm starting to think my sister is a secret agent for Goat. Also, I like exaggerating and calling things "fascist."   After said events we hung out at Bryce's house for a few hours. That was pretty fun, I always enjoy going to Bryce's house. Bryce got the sweet guitar from Honest George that I was in love with and stupidly tipped him off to. It is really cool. I would talk about it more, but I am really bitter about it and I'm just going to try and let it go. After that, it was 'round six, and we hung out in the parking lot for a while. Nate Lucas showed up and chatted and played hackey sack with us, and then we went into the show. There was the normal scenesters there, but there were a suprising number of sophomores and TV Pro kids there too. Yeah, it might have been the first social function I've ever been to that I knew everyone. Joe's band wasn't bad. They were talented (by "they" I mean mostly Joe and Tom), but I found their music uninteresting and lacking energy. I'll just chalk that up to first-show jitters, and I'm sure that their next concert will rock 12 times as hard. Oh, and I taped the show.   After the show we went back to Bryce's place for some Halo. We were all pretty pumped at the prospect of beating Team Goat in Halo, and we played for a long time. To be specific, we played from 8:30 till 4:30 in the morning. Me and Chris and Bryce got the worst sleeping places, with me  and Chris on the floor and me using the dog piss blanket, Chris on the floor kicking me in the head in his sleep, and Bryce sleeping on top of the pool table. Erik was lucky enough to get the couch and Dustin was long asleep in Bryce's bed by the time we quit Halo. The night was really rough on the floor with Bryce's hyperactive dog stealing my pillow, Erik stepping on me in the middle of the night, and Chris kicking me in the face. I slept about 2 hours, and I am pretty tired right now.   Some random miscellaneous things:  When people use the word "tweens" it really bothers me. It is the worst word ever, because you know anything connected to it is going to suck. It also connotates that the aforementioned "tweens" will grow into teenagers, and then you better watch out, because you know teenagers! I hate being called a teenager. Being lumped in with my peers at BHS bothers me because I am so different from them. I don't suffer from their boring emo teen angst or listen to their hip-hop or speak their ebonics. I'm sure I offend them too.  Last week of school. Wow. I don't really know what to think about that. Let me just say one more thing:  ONLY THREE MORE HOURS OF FST AND CHEMISTRY, THE MOST ILL-CONCIEVED AND POINTLESS CLASSES EVER MADE! HURRAH!  Wow, that was long.

      Best of luck to the Warrior tennis team, we're off to sub-sections at 6:45 tomorrow morning... The only advantage being that we're playing Bemidji, so they'll have to be leaving about now to get to Alex by 9 tomorrow morning.  Also... what do you guys think of this cutting article? Link: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4980465/ He makes some sure points, but his attacks dive way too far in my honest opinion. He starts to joke as he goes on, but the feeling's still there. Yes, Episode I was a big disappointment, but Episode II easily rectified the problems, and I can't wait for Episode III. Other ideas readers came up with were giving direction to Spielberg and plot to Shamaylan, which wouldn't be too bad in my opinion. Shamaylan is a dark genius, perfect for what Episode III has been set up to be. GL doesn't need to be totally ditched though.  I spent my first lazy weekend in probably months. Now that AP and English are all over, i didn't even bring my backpack home. I took a nap. A nap! I've been running on half a tank since about March. Unfortunately, I was feeling under the weather, and missed a Boxfest at Bryce's Saturday night, but that's alright.   In other news, I'm preparing myself in advance. I need some insults to throw back at the Germans when they start attacking me next year. I'm not gonna be a bigot and all, commenting about Hitler... I'll think up a lotta things more original than that. So far, I've got about one:  "Yeah, so how many  Germans  have been on the moon? Huh? Huh? Yeah, I thought so..." I could use some help, though, if anyone wanted to lend it... But then I've got to translate all of it, which might make it not even worth the trouble.   In early times some sufferer had to sit up with a toothache, and he put in the time inventing the German language. -Mark Twain

      Well M-son, I never thought the day would come, but I acctually agree with you.  I am not a Bush supporter nor hater.  I think it is fricken' hilarious that you and Tay have the same "not my president" shirt.    The end of school coming really hasen't hit me yet also.  It is pretty cool that we will get the group square in chemisty.  I dont know why Holby is such a bigot against our idea.  Its all in fun man.  Why cant you be happy that this is happening?  JUST LAY THE FRICK OFF MANN!!  Also, we will have to burn all of our school stuff, but when? (Holby, lay off!! What is your problem here?)    You guys should give me your phone numbers so we can play tennis in the summer if you want.

      I don't think it is completely how you were raised though. I, after all, was also raised in a conservative religious family. Today, I was wearing my Bad Religion T-shirt, which 600 people have told me offends them (even though they have no idea what it means). So I went over to my moms for a while, and she took one look at my shirt and said, "I don't know why you are so different, Josh."   Well, I don't know why you're so freaking nuts, mom.

      I'm sorry I called you a liar, Johnny. I was just remembering you saying how you'd rather condition and run inside than play tennis outside wearing a sweatshirt. You're often sneaky and underhanded, but you're definately not a flat-out liar.  About the factual stuff with debates. I didn't mean that your arguments were weak because you didn't pull up a bunch of facts. It just seemed whenever you argued with Schilling you were constantly on the defensive; you never fully brought down any of his facts without saying "so?", and rarely made any attacks without seeming tired of arguing and turning sarcastic as though you'd just thrashed him totally.   Clearing up, THE ONES THAT SCARE ME often are very intelligent, but have just seen the world in a different way than I. Brought up in a starkly Catholic conservative household, vs. Wanninger, and who knows what the heck he was but certainly not religious conservatism, it's easy to see how his perspective has been formed. Sure that he is right, he simply adds and adds to his argument. I was awfully impressed though that Schilling and Tay's awfully poor argument brought him to do research on the matter. It's possible they had slightly phazed him.   I like it when old people swear. It's more authentic, more brutally real. Nowadays, every f***ing kid is dropping a f***ing F-bomb every five f***ing seconds. After such repeated use and so on, it really loses its meaning.    Profanity is the crutch of a conversational cripple. ~ Jay Alexander  Old people don't swear unless they have reason too, for the most part. When they swear, its easily justified by their condition; they've lived through the nuclear age, when we don't know if we'll live to see tomorrow. They've fought at Normandy and Korea and Nam, they know a lot more about life. I hardly ever swear. I'm not offended by others oding it, but words are our most powerful weapons, and I prefer to reserve mine for occasions when they're called for, not something like stubbing my toe, or losing a game of tennis. Furthermore, as the above quote says, one can usually find a better way to say what they want to, and one that's almost always more specific to case than any curseword.

      I must say, I don't think I make up things about Bush. I only tell the truth. Honest John is my name and telling the truth is my game. Embellishing the truth, on the other hand, is different. Most things are so boring, and need to be spiced up in order to be interesting.  Well, my Gatsby essay, after being taken apart by three people, is back in order. After a few runs through John's Alchemy Machine, I have turned crap into gold. Now, I am pretty sure I have my A in english locked down. In Spanish, I have an A. In Chemistry I have an A. In FST I amazingly busted out an A and Orchestra I have an A too. In my AP classes I have a B and a C. Now, with a little luck I will be able to pull some fours on those tests. That will be good.   Mattson, we should film that "Why White People Are Different From Black People" sometime. That would be funny as long as we got to play the roles of racist rednecks. In other movie news, Bubba Ho-tep comes out soon. Although I haven't seen it yet, it looks horrible in a good way. A way that may be hilarious, and even if it isn't, it will still be so dumb it will be hilarious.   Yeah, this weekend I have the kickball tournament Saturday morning and then Joe Day's concert Saturday night. That's about it.

      Ah, Thursday.  I always enjoy Thursdays. This one, however, was foul. I don't know why, but it sucked. Tomorrow is the last Friday of the school year, so that will be good.  What won't be good, however, is tomorrow is Blue Team's last update. I'm kinda bummed out about that.   My essay didn't take that long to revise, so I was pretty homework free tonight. I did FST in English, because I did English in APUSH. I really hope that we are done watching movies in APUSH. I thought it was going to be fun, and I just don't have the patience to watch movies on a May afternoon.   I don't really know where I fall in Houley's Liberal spectrum. I dislike George Bush, but I'm not a Bush-hater. I don't know what the "Rebel" has to do with it. I don't back things up with "facts" because you can prove anything with a statistic. Schilling takes something off an obviously biased website and passes it off as fact. Well, I could go to a liberal website and grab some facts too. I seriously think I could win most debates with a reasonable conservative (read: someone who actually listens) because I am a hardcore news junkie. I read the newspaper every day, watch the news every night, and spend about an hour a day on a bunch of news websites. I would like to stop but it really irks me when someone talks about a current event and I don't know what is going on. But enough about politics from me for now.   It hasn't hit me yet that school is almost over. It hasn't sunk in that in a week, I'll be done with school and have 90 lovely days away from the boring mass of hypocrisy that is BHS.   Baccalaureate last night was kinda fun. It was cool playing around with the headsets. Plus, I had the easiest job.  Went downtown today to do a standup for TV Pro. I did some pretty retarded things in Fishhead TV Pro, but this was waaaay stupider. Which reminds me, I have to go back to TV Pro. to work on my package in a while.  I like downtown. It seemed like my teammates didn't really know their way around downtown, but I do. Man, I love downtown. You have your legitimate, respectable stores on one block (Coco Moon, Northwind, Bridge, etc.), and then you go a block over and everything is just scummy bars and pawn shops. My uncle used to own Tropical Nights and that seemed like a seedy place. I know I wouldn't ever want to be in there at night, because it always seemed to me like a place for guys who wore their hats backwards and listened to Goat music would go. Still though, every couple weekends we hit Honest George's and then go wander around downtown.   Now that Garage Sale season has started, me and Chris will probably spend the next 3-4 Saturday mornings hitting every Garage Sale in the Brainerd Lakes Area.   I like how this blog is growing. Bryce said he wanted to get in on the action, and if you know anyone else, post so.  I am working on a end-of-year type retrospective for the blog, so maybe you guys could make one too and we could put them together? It would be cool to put them all on one post so email yours to me at badreligion015@hotmai.com

      Alright Mattson, I believe it is spelled "cavity."  Either that or I'm wrong.  I'm goin' for my second 4.0 G.P.A. in a row.  My "A" in APUSH makes up for my "B" in English.  That's soon to change though, since I'm sitting on an 89.7% in the class.  My Gatsby essay is sure to push it up. . . I hope.  I'm going to a wedding on Friday in Granite Falls so I won't be in school for the second half of the day.  The only class I'll really miss anything in is chemistry.  Ahh chemistry. . .it feels good to have the highest grade in a class.  In fact, I haven't felt this good since last year in biology, before Johnny V. snuck up on my "A" and crushed my dreams forever.  Enough talk about science, besides, Mattson should be almost sick just seeing the words chemistry and science so much.  I'll post on Monday, on Monday, on Mon. . . .

      I'm too tired from Baccalaureate to get into anything tonight. So I'll post a longer post tomorrow, after my trip to the dentist.  A few things though: I saw a truck down in the pit today that had two bumper stickers. One said, "I love cats, they taste just like chicken." The other said, "So many cats, so few recipes."  Skipped Chemistry today to go downtown filming with Kaddy/Kali. It was nice to be outside.  I have to go to get a cavaty filled tomorrow. That will be scary. Even scarier, though, is that "cavaty" might be the commonly used word in the English language that I can't spell. Someone wanna get back to me on that, tomorrow?  Until tomorrow, then.

      Thanks, Josh. I needed that. It's been way too long. Finally. But it's good to be blogging, I guess.  Now that I'm on, I'm not too sure what to do. I finished my Gatsby essay, and I'm waiting for the sweet, sweet feeling of freedom to come flushing through my body. It won't be there fully till I hand in my final draft, but there's no way, after 95.1% in the class, AND student of the semester from Wang that I'ma get a B in that class, even if my essay is the worst one I've done.   As I see it, there's three main classes of liberals. In ascending order of my respect for them: BUSHWHACKERS: this is largely just a group of idiots who make fun of Bush because he can't talk. Man, that Bush is an idiot. He said, "Is our children learning?" He's obviously NOT fit for the job JUST because of that. They all hop on the bandwagon of making fun of him. It'd be interesting to see their views of the Prez if Kerry wins. REBELS: mainly those who are too lazy or just don't want to follow authority, they justify themselves as being 'non-conformist.' some of these people i like, such as anderw boos. however, there are those even below bushwhackers, like Ms. Borkenhagen. She just ignored one of the short essays on the APUSH test. It's the only time I've seen Lade dumbfounded, seriously dumbfounded. Not even when CJ said that Iraqi prisoner abuse was 'fair play' was he totally shellshockedly dumbfounded. Lastly, THE ONES THAT SCARE ME: Wanninger and Al Franken to name two, these guys know what they're talking about. Sure that they are right, they stomp all over every mistake any conservative makes. They hold their own and more in any argument, largely because of their superior experience and intelligence in about every matter.  My liberal friends like Mattson and Johnny don't fit these groups well. Mattson's bordering on scary, but doesn't provide enough proof that differs from the bushwhackers to truly scare me. And Johnny makes up stuff to try and prove his point, so his credibility is sorely hurting.  I truly don't see Chris as a "real guy." He's more like the Osbournes. I sort of like them in this grotesque fashion. I don't give them a lot of respect, but they don't command a lot from me. I do, however, enjoy his company for the most part, when he behaves himself in a socially acceptable manner. He's funny, crazy, and... um... innovative. Yeah, innovative.  I've had a lot of pent-up thoughts while not being part of this blog, so expect a number of lengthy posts to follow from me.   Of all God's creatures there is only one that cannot be made the slave of the lash. That one is the cat. If man could be crossed with the cat it would improve man, but it would deteriorate the cat. -Mark Twain

      Basically, Kerry will win if he does two things. First, he has to pull in moderates. Second, he has to keep the veteran vote in his pocket. Not to mention Bush is only helping by digging his own grave.  O yes, I borrowed (stole)  "Pressure makes diamonds." Hobie also donated the catchy "The man with a plan" thing. Got new guitar strings after school (finally). Thats good. Did some other stuff and then went to my orchestra concert. Thats about it for today.  (Josh's Note): Borrowed is such a pretty word. Let's use stole.

      Today I was recruited by the Kerry campaign.  I don't particularly like John Kerry, his moderatism, and the way he flip-flops on issues. But I believe that basically he is a good guy at heart, and I will do my part to help preserve American democracy. Hell, I'd take almost any candidate over Bush. His corrupt administration that panders to corporations and espouses on moral values while lying to the American people digusts me.  To tell the truth, I was a Deaniac. That takes a lot of courage to say now, and many of the former Deaniacs will not admit that they once backed the Mad Doctor. I liked Howard Dean, Kucinich was the best man for the job, and Edwards was the most politically viable. But it is Kerry we have, and Kerry I'll support.   Kerry could gain a lot from running a clean, positive campaign. I don't believe he will, though. He could be attacking Bush much stronger on Iraq and the economy instead of arguing with him over talking points like gay marraige.  I think the reason Kerry will win is that many more people will mobilize for him and support him. Bush will have his run-of-the-mill conservative vote, but most moderates and maybe even a large chunk of moderate Republicans will vote for Kerry. I think this will be due to two things: Iraq spiraling out of control, and grassroots political campaigning. Many people will come out and support their candidate because this really feels like a battle for the soul of America. Organizations like moveon.org have already gotten tons of new voters registered, and these votes will go Kerry. Bush will have the money, but Kerry will have the people.  But if the Kerry administration becomes like the current one, I won't hesitate to wear a "Not my President" shirt with his face on it. I am only marginally loyal to the Democratic party.  Today, something happened that has never happened before. I had a halfway decent picture took of me! I was shocked because in every other picture I have always had a painfully obvious fake smile or a glazed, stoned look on my face. It is for my efolio and I am going to try and make it so the sidebar on the right has the people's pictures next to their names.  Speaking of efolio, John, you swiped my "Pressure makes diamonds," you jackass.   Today when I was driving to and from school I had to listen to conservative talk radio, due to my CD adapter being busted. It really, really, really sucked.   It's cool how we have five people to post here now. I hope more join.

      I dont feel that embaressed when I am out with Chris.  He really isn't that bad.  Ya he can be a moron when he shouts out in a movie or something, but he is pretty cool.  I  think it will be worse seeing some freak on the corner with a green kilt.  I hope you wont work that corner with Ramsdale.    Mattson, why would you bother getting a CD player in your car when you treat it like shit and it probably wont last that much longer where you should drop the cash for it now.  The best part of my day was when I heard "psuedo- punk" and then shillist's gambling addiction was settled by T. Nelson.  When it took a long time to figure out how to use this site.  Dont bother asking me.  I wont laugh.

      I must say that the HALO teams are pretty even. I think that with me sniping, the DrH/Jarid cheapass rock/sniping combo and PK bringing up the rear, we will be pretty good. Then there is team Houle/Mattson/Eric/Chris (Jason beat Mattson for number one seed ;)...) that should be interesting. I foresee that it will be doing much of the killing for the other teams. Also, there is team Hobie and the Jets. They will just have to run out of their rocket fuel sooner or later. Finally, team Shindo... and Andy. That will be bad.  Well, I can't go to anymore tennis meets so I'm pretty much done with that. I still have to see Van Helsing and Troy... but I probably won't see the latter until it comes out on VHS/DVD. I also have to get around to watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre again. Anyways, school is almost over and I think this summer will be great. A few things, like my car (along with other things), should make this a very good summer. Orchestra concert tomorrow. We suck. Thats about it for that. Also, I have to do that Gatsby essay on Wednesday and Thursday night. That will be fun. After that essay, all that is left is a Spanish test and a Math test...

      Alright you guys, I finally made it onto the blog. *cheers and clapping*  Anyway I was just reading what you guys had posted about Chris, and for the most part I believe that he is an alright guy.  Unlike most people I do get a little embarassed when Chris makes a complete fool of himself because it puts a little black spot of cancer on my perfect reputation.  *sarcasm*  Don't worry though, someday I'll be the crazy guy on the end of the street who wears a kilt and has green hair because he was nice to everyone all the time but eventually cracked and now he talks to himself as he eats cabbage from his three square foot garden next to a shack containing fifteen varieties of stuffed crows, all of which were stuffed by hand in the dark after reading the paper, twice.   . . .   Either that or being nice will pay off and I'll earn a high paying job in the computer market.  It could go either way though.

      Despite the best efforts of Nate Lucas to fix my camera, it is unfixable. So I am just going to buy a disposable one. I haven't took any pictures yet this year.  I hate how it is either too hot out or too cold out. I wish it would just stay one way.  Got into a few arguments today about punk and Halo. I was going to write about punk today (what with me being called a "psuedopunk" today and all), but I decided not to. I'm ok with myself, and I don't need to defend my punkness to other people.  My CD Adapter broke today. That is the worst thing that has happened to me in a while. I don't know how long I'll be able to listen to the Power Loon until I freak out and drive off a bridge.   (maybe if someone would give me the money they owed me)  Anyway, I read this on punkrocks.net today, they're talking about Troy: aaronfeibus (7:53:10 PM): be tru to the story dogg kevwad (7:53:28 PM): yeah aaronfeibus (7:56:39 PM): like an almond aaronfeibus (7:56:42 PM): almonds dont front aaronfeibus (7:57:02 PM): theyre like "yeah we are dry and wrinkly on the outside" aaronfeibus (7:57:11 PM): "...but bite into us and we taste damn fine"  Funny.

      I'm pretty sure I don't like to go to some public places with him because he is rude and loud and has no respect for anything or anyone. That doesnn't change the fact he is the most obnoxious person I know.

      John, the reason you don't like him is because you care too much about what people think about you and I guess that he embarasses you in front of other people.  Today was the laziest Sunday ever, from a long line of lazy Sundays. I got up at noon and haven't really done anything since then. I'm still in my pajamas.   Tomorrow kicks off the last full week of school. I'm looking forward to that. I think we should just get out of school two weeks early, because no one does anything or puts forth any effort in the last few weeks of school. I think most teachers recognize this and try to get all the important stuff out of the way by the end of the first week of May. But my FST and Chemistry teachers persist in making me work.   I wish I could start on that Gatsby essay. I'm paralyzed with indecision over it. I was going to start it today but I hated to waste a perfectely lazy Sunday working.

      Ok... I'm pretty sure people don't like Chris because he is obnoxious as hell. Also, he acts like a retard all the time... Not because they think they are better than him... Kinda like Tay... Tay brings about what people think about him with his own doing. It's not like people have an unfair bias against Tay or Chris, it's that Tay is a jackass and Chris is annoying.

      Usually, it's not a good idea to follow your impulses.   Case in point: Today me and Chris went to about 30 Garage Sales. At the first one we came to, there was a big box of Halloween costumes. We ended up buying these dress/tunic type things, mine green, Chris black. Then things got a little out of hand and we added masks, a bunch of watches, and plastic baseball bats. Long story short, my mom pulls up and me and Chris start banging on her windows with the baseball bats, yelling "Respect! Respect! Respect!" This story didn't really go where I had planned, but that's ok.    There was an Xbox thing tonight but I didn't go. I just didn't have the patience to sit through four hours of bad jokes while starting at a little TV in a hot room.    I went to Troy last night, with Chris and the Hobster. Except Bryce ended up actually seeing Troy and Hobie went to Van Helsing. I don't know why this happened, but me and Chris were confused about Hobie's actions. So we wrote an as-of-yet untitled song about Hobie.    One reason I will be happy when school is out is that I am really sick of seeing everybody every day.    I got this really awesome 35mm camera today for a dollar. I think the lady gave me a discount because she called my tunic a dress. Chris got a turntable.   I need to clean my car out and wash it. We were going to do that today, but you know, the tunics and the bats were too much fun.   I like going places with Chris because he connects with people almost everywhere he goes. He seems like a real person to them. Even Schilling likes Chris. I think the only people who don't like him are elitests who think they are better than everyone.    I don't like people who keep their disdain on the inside.    Next week is the last week of school. Only problem, I've got that Gatsby essay to write, and I have no idea where to start. I'm pretty sure I have a high English grade, so I'll probably just slap something together on Thursday night and cross my fingers.   Did you enjoy music this weekend? I know I did. I always do.   I,I,I,I. Always about me.

      Well, last night I went to the choir concert. It wasn't too bad, in fact it was pretty good. Anyways, today, XBOX party! First, we meet at Hobies house to form a caravan at 6:45. Then, we are off to Jake Rogencamp's house. Then, the killing will commence. I think it should be Team Sophmore v. All. That would be good.

      School doesn't really bother me anymore. I know it will be over soon, it has thrown it's worst at me, and now it has no power over me. Every pointless hour I spend in Chemistry and FST is spent counting off the hours of them I have left. But I think I'll feel bad about school ending. School to summer is such an abrupt shift, and I find that I spend all of June just trying to figure out what to do with my spare time. My favorite part of summer are the hours I keep. I basically stay up until 3 or 4 am, and then sleep until 1-3 pm. It is the most relaxing thing you could ever do. To me, getting up before noon in the summer is the worst sort of blasphemy.    The last obstacle that looms before me is the Gatsby essay. I have no idea where to start, and I think I am going to get a crappy grade on it. I get a crappy grade on it, chances are most people will do horrible.   Tay is the biggest psuedoliberal ever, I've decided. Mr. Wanninger said that I couldn't technically call him a psuedoliberal because he is a far-right Democrat. Seriously, I'm going to make a "Not my friend" T-Shirt. I was going to make a bunch, but I don't really wanna hop on the "hate Tay" bandwagon, even though he is a jackass. He's not the only one though. I dislike people who hate Bush just because they think it is cool. Fact of the matter is, it isn't about GW. It is about a battle for the hearts and the minds of the American people between progressive and regressive. Not conservative and liberal, progressive and regressive. You won't impress me by hating George Bush.    Regardless of the above paragraph, I still dislike most conservatives. I know that right-wingers like Rush and John Ashcroft aren't really representative of the whole right, but you almost never meet moderate conservatives like Houley. It's always crazy facists like Schilling or people who decide that their religion allows them to always have the moral high ground. Well, I guess Schilling counts in that group too. Schilling is alright though. I enjoy listening to his crazy rhetoric. I can't figure out why some people are conservatives, like Hannah. We haven't talked about politics much, though when we working on the Iraq package she assured me she was a "flaming Republican." Maybe it's just the way her and the Hobster were raised..... I'm glad I escaped the stigma of conservatism, even though almost all of my extended family think I'm a crazy liberal, with the exception of my oh-so-understanding grandma....    What is up with kids and music today? I mean, you either listen to mainstream music, or you try and grab as much indie cred as possible and listen to stuff so esoteric that no one understands.  When I hear kids in my classes listening to hardcore rap I just want to walk over to them and shout, "You are an upper-class white kid, moron! You have no idea what these guys are talking about!" I confess I often prejudge kids based on the music they listen to. If someone listens to industrial, nu- or black metal, or any other sorts of "heavy" music, I have a hard time taking them seriously. If you listen to rap, chances are you stereotype and glamourize life on the streets. If you listen to emo, well, you suck. I can't really put it any other way. I dislike emo more than any other kind of music. It is such an insincere, bland, indifferent form of music that I don't know why kids listen to it.    Indie weirds me out. I enjoy to listen to it, but only as an observer. I can't feel any force or energy, positive or negative, behind it.    I guess I have been generalizing indie. Let me ameliorate that to "stuff that is on Hobie's computer weirds me out." There.   But my number one music pet peeve in the universe is pop-punks. I don't hate them with the fervor of the Oselands, and I don't fall over myself trying to prove my punkness, but they annoy the hell out of me. Some kids at my school think that slapping on a NOFX or Casualties shirt makes them punk. It doesn't. I plan on going into a "What is punk?" type deal some other day. But let me say this: I don't care if you're in the Casualties army. I don't care if you have a mohawk. Any jackass with clippers (as me and Chris proved) can get one. Punk is challenging the common tenets and beliefs of society. Anyone can be a punk, but you are not.    But enough ranting. This weekend, derive enjoyment from music. Don't just listen to music, feel it. And remember, no matter how bad your music tastes are, I won't make fun you. (At least not to your face.)   I'm dreading and looking forward to the end of school.

      Well... Let me be the first to say that Bad Religion is a pretty good band... But to say that they essentially started punk is going to far. It is impossible to say that any one band really invented any genre of music. The reason for this is because there is always someone else who did the same thing earlier. All this later band did was change it and in the case of punk, just took rock and put in some anti-gov/anti-whatever lyrics. The lyrics part may be too general, but you know what punk bands sing about. A great example of the altering of music is Bob Dylan. He is a great song write in his own time but there were people before him. People such as Woody Guthrie. Obviously Dylan didn't invent the folk-singer genre, he just took it and modernized it. Much like this, Bad Religion just took the punk genre, and made it more punk. It didn't make punk, it made their own punk. Every good band has their own little niche in their genre. Whether it is through a unique voice (Johnny Cash) or through their playing style (Jimi Hendrix). Because of all this, it is hard to say when any genre really started. Take rock-n-roll. RnR was essentially formed in the 50's by a number of bands. The fact is though, those bands got many of their ideas from earlier music (Jazz, swing). Now I leave you with a song recommendation... A Boy Named Sue by Johnny Cash.

      My favorite CD of all time is Bad Religion's "No Control."   It was really the first great punk CD I ever heard. I had heard a lot of mainstream punk bands, like NOFX, Pennywise, mainstays of punk. But No Control made me love punk. It was a thousand times more punk than anything NOFX or Rancid could put out. It was a million times more essential than the mainstream music of 1989 when it first came out. Furthermore, it is still essential and relevant today. Greg Graffin's warnings against progress and industry still resonate as clearly today as they did 15 years ago. In this sense Bad Religion transcendes and outdoes two of the "Big Three" of punk. The Sex Pistols and the Ramones were just looking for a good time. I enjoy both of those bands, but they just don't seem truly "great" to me. I haven't talked about the third of the three forefathers of punk. The last, and most relevant, was the Clash. In my opinion, all great punk bands (and some ska, and some reggae) spring from the Clash. Most punk bands will admit that they were influenced by the Clash. Of course, I didn't mention many of the other forefathers of punk (Iggy and the Stooges, Bad Brains, Minor Threat, etc), but these are more along the lines of hardcore. Anyway, music doesn't evolve in a straight line. But really, if you get a chance, check out Bad Religion.    I'm not bitter. It's a dirty lie that conservatives made up to discredit me. Also, I am less angry than most. I can't remember the last time I was truly mad. I will admit to getting irritated once in a while though.

      Today was not so bad. We kinda took it easy in all our classes, and now it feels like the worst tenth grade has to offer is over. BHS has a breezy, summer feeling atmosphere to it now. I can enjoy myself in school much more than usual.   After school today there was a lot of fishheads in the TV Prod. room while I was working on my english project. It was weird being the only Advanced kid in there, when it used to be only me and Hobie in there and all the rest were Advanced kids.    So there is this kid at school that most people don't like. They dislike him because he is very condescending to most people, and they revile him because they perceive him as smarter than them. But he usually does act like he is better than everyone else. I guess the reason I did like him before was because he was smarter than most people. But now certain actions that he has taken have shown me that he is really is the same as the rest of us. Maybe a little unscrupulous, but who isn't? Every day he goes to school he loses because he doesn't expect to learn anything, because he already knows more than everyone. This is a very regressive thing for an intellectual. Instead of saying, "I know everything," say, "I know nothing." An eagerness to learn would help him much more in his endeavors, especially in something that he desperately wants. But who am I to meddle?   Tomorrow I think I am going to talk about my favorite CD.

      I must say, today was pretty boring. After a rather fun weekend, today just sucked. Actually, for about two weeks my life has been steadily improving because of a few things. First of all school is almost over and then there are just other reasons... Tennis has been getting longer and longer though, and playing with Conrad is the worst. At least I don't have to go to tennis tomorrow because I have to study for my AP Gov't test on Wednesday... Amen to that... I recently saw the movie The Last Samurai... Overall, it was a good movie but a little unrealistic as many movies are. The whole concept of Tom Cruise becoming a Samurai after spending only a few months among them is a little absurd.

      Today was a really boring day. School was bland and uninformative. It was like listening to Hawkeye talk for 7 hours (just kidding). Seriously though, he needs some excitement in his life.  I'm really happy that school is ending soon. Everyone says it, but only a few people really believe it. But anyway, I'm trying to get other people to join this, so maybe a few people will post on this each day. I'm not exactly sure how it works yet.  A lot of people think I am a jerk, but I bet I am secretly a nice guy.

      A couple things about this weekend:  It kinda sucked. It was nice Friday after the AP Test, but nothing much really came out of Friday afternoon. We played football in Gregory Park, but John quit. I'm still pissed at him for ruining our precious football game.   Me and Chris drove around, found some place to park, and stopped. Then we rolled down all the windows and put our seats back and listened to Bob Marley. It was strangely fulfilling.  I take back everything I said about Ben Kweller. I tried to listen to it for a while and it just grated on me. Maybe I only liked it the first time because it was a Friday night CD. Anyway, that was my one-time fling with indie rock.  Me and the Oselands went down to the emo concert on Saturday night. We snuck in the side doors because it was like 5 bucks. This emo kid chewed us out because that 15 bucks would have helped to cover the costs of playing emo. It was the last concert of this band called Donkey's Jawbone. Anyway, while they were setting up the guitarist played the riff from the Bouncing Souls "Lamar Vannoy." We got excited, and thought that maybe we weren't in for a half hour of bad music. Then they started playing, and we hated it. It was just very unpleasant to listen to, and we left 2 minutes into their first song. Two good things did come out of it, though: One, I got to catch up with Shannon. I don't see her very often anymore. Two, Chris got to meet his hero again, Nate Lucas. Chris yelled, "Hey! Ferris!" down from the balcony and Nate replied with some sort of noise.   Overall, the weekend kinda sucked other than a few high points. It is pretty easy to deal with a crappy weekend though, because there is only three weeks of school left, and then [/i]every[i] day will be Saturday morning.   Lots of project work/Mother's day tomorrow.

      To tell you the truth, I don't enjoy reading blogs. They just seem really like a self-serving way to boost your ego and tell everyone else how great you are. I didn't really want to make a blog. But tonight, I was surfing the Internet, looking at the Chris Derby/Dan Holbrook plagarism thing, and I found out that Chris Derby had called me an "ass muncher." You know who warned him to take off the stuff that he blatantly ripped off Dan Holbrook (and he did, everyone could see it before he deleted it)? Me. You know who defended him when everyone else called him an arrogant prick who thinks he is better than everyone? Me. And he goes and calls me an "ass muncher" behind my back. But I digress. This whole thing got me to thinking about the Internet. It used to be me who insulted people behind their backs from the safety of a computer monitor. Did I grow up, or am I just behind the times? I know I didn't grow up so it must be the latter. Anyway, here we are. I don't see myself pondering anything deep or meaningful here. That's not what the Internet is for. It's for calling people who defended you "ass munchers."

      I'll be done with work tomorrow, and I'll blog tomorrow. But for now, I'll keep it short.  Last night myself, Bryce, Dustin, Allyson, Irene, and John went to the midnight premiere of  Spiderman 2 . I found it pretty entertaining, worth the five bucks I paid even though I only slept for five hours last night.   Today I went to work, got off.  Then, I got an iPod. It is really cool. I've always considered myself of the PC side of the holy war, but this is perhaps the most beautiful technical product I've ever seen. Better yet, my dad paid for 2/3 of it and all I have to do is get a haircut.  Before the iPod, Kali called and asked me if I was wanted to go to  Fahrenheit 9/11 . Since I was only sixteen, she hung up on me which was kinda good anyway because I couldn't imagine riding in a car with them for two hours. Later, when I was reading the paper, I saw that it came to Brainerd, and she wasn't talking about St. Cloud like I thought. After I gave the Rastaman such a hard time, it turned out that it was coming after all. So me and Chris went. I just walked up and bought a ticket (so there, Kali), and Chris snuck in. I found it both disturbing and entertaining. The George Bush parts were pretty funny, but didn't really say anything I didn't already know. The Iraq parts, however, were thought-provoking. I didn't think that  Fahrenheit  would change anyone's opinion, but after seeing it I think that the images of Iraq are disturbing enough to turn someone against the war. I was appalled at the sights of burned civilians and dead children. I logically realize that Michael Moore is manipulating my emotions, yet it still makes my heart sick to see what goes on in Iraq every day.  I'm not glad that they took the coffins out. This is another example of the BACP trying to please everyone rather than expressing their true opinions. Why not, when we celebrate our independence, remember what is sacrificed for it? People should realize the cost of freedom for Iraqis and for us Americans. As conservatives so often spout, "freedom doesn't come free."  I'm going to bed. I'll get going on that stuff tomorrow or something.

      really, it's true. slowly but surely, so gradually as barely to be noticed, I think everyones dropping like flies that die of starvation.   everyone's happy that the peace protesters (sp? dunno) took the coffins out of their float. no need for those. let's have a happy fourth. although, the "withdraw the troops now" banner is also going far, though it's a matter of opinion. a very stupid one in my view, but still borderline valid. even folks such as john kerry and john wanninger and john deere maybe agree that that's not even an option. but whatever.  also let's get that G&B going. i'm eager for it, man.  in more news, the WoT RPG needs to get started up again. It wasn't the problem, we were. I'm sure I could be a good DM, and we've already got 7 adventures plus a nice cache on the Net also.   I'ma miss that parade anyways, so it's not really pertinent that it be good. I'm working 12-7.   Went to St. Cloud today. Jedi Academy for Xbox was bought. It looks decent. That's mostly all I've to say.  Haven't seen any of Wimbledon. I'm going to tomorrow, though. Also there's a dubs tourney in Elk River on Monday that'll have to face the awesome powers of Hobe&PK, also me and Jefe.   Songlist edits, v2.0  Tribute - Tenacious D Walking in Memphis - Billy Joel & Elton John Miss Robinson - Simon and Garfunkel Along Comes Mary - The Association  I'm about done.

      Gotta work tomorrow.   The big news today: We turned sovereignity over to the Iraqis today (Two days early, even! George is on top of his game!). Yeah, today Bremer shipped out, after putting some final crippling laws on the interim government. Not only do the new laws make it easy for the US to ensure that Western-friendly candidates will be elected, they leave room for heinous human rights violations. From now on, U.S. contractors are  immune  from Iraqi law while doing whatever job the government has overpaid them to do.   The Iraqi government is mainly symbolic, as we still have to enforce the peace and bear the costs.  I read in the newspaper the other day that we were in Germany and Japan for  sixty  years. Can you imagine us in this quagmire for five more years, or a decade? Sadly enough, it seems that because of the neo-cons some of my friends or acquaintances might have to go to Iraq after high school.   I was too tired from Hobe's birthday to do anything today, so I watched  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  and read two Stephen King novellas. Stephen King is actually quite a good writer. I won't claim to like most of his commerical stuff, but I love his short story comps and, of course, the  Dark Tower  series, one of the most epic fantasy series concieved since  Lord of the Rings . Also, it isn't your cookie-cutter elves and goblins, either. It is like a sad romance Western laced with King's commitment to seek the truth of human nature. If you haven't ever read a King book, you should. His style of writing is interesting and easy to read.    Office Space  is coming on in a few minutes. I'd better wrap this up.  The Jetpack turning seventeen was a weird event. When I first got to his house I had a "where has the time gone" moment. I mean, I knew this kid back when my mom still liked me. It also made me think about how unfair time is. Jet is seventeen, as is Hannah. One is graduated from high school, and the other still has two years to go. I've always felt mature for my age, but everyone says that I just hate everything. We did some stuff, which was fun but not really interesting enough to record here, and went to sleep rather late. Now, we had like eight people crammed down in his boathouse, and it was pure torture trying to sleep. When I went to sleep at four, I was sleeping on a futon with two other people. My feet stuck way off the end and I was miserable. Sometime during the night, I fell off the futon and was kicked in the face several times.  My teeth hurt.

      Going to watch a movie, so I'm going to blog a more interesting blog tomorrow.  According to mensa.org, I have a high chance of passing the entrance exam. 25 out of 30, but I skipped a couple math questions.  Today I discovered that I really  did  have an innate talent of rocking, and I wasn't just trying to fool myself. I've adopted a new policy of bringing my acoustic wherever I go.  I've got to buy Hobie a birthday present. It will be the precious gift of music. It has to be something that he'll like, yet I won't feel bad about buying him. He took well enough to last year's CD, and I'm going to try for something more esoteric this year. Sadly, Hobe didn't take to punk. Also, having seen the effects of exposing John to my music, I'm going to forego getting him anything I like a lot. Plus, he hates the Clash. Even more blasphemous, he hates the Casualties. The Casualties, man.    What the Hobster might like (if he opened his mind and gave it a chance): Sublime Bob Marley and the Wailers Atom and his Package Wesley Willis  Well, not Wesley.  What do you buy a emo-indie fan who hates anything musically interesting?  Ben Kweller, that's what.  I already bought that for John for  his  birthday, even though I could've easily just got him a Souls or a LTJ CD. What a waste of a present.  On Thursday, me and John took my mom's van over to my grandma's house. Now, I wouldn't say that I was driving  completely  out of control, but it was close. It was the most sublime driving experience ever, and now I would drive that van all day long if I could. It ate John's Ben Kweller CD. Anyway, I ended up fishtailing all over my grandma's lawn and tearing it up, which wasn't my fault at all. I simply wasn't used to driving it.  If I don't find anything cool tomorrow at Best Buy tomorrow, I'll consult with some real emo-indie music jerk snobs.  See you, Space Cowboy.

      Yup, I actually think it was the Hobe's bday on Wednesday. Not sure, but I think so. Anyone heard anything from him lately? Also, Mattson, Jason said you were trying to get off work so you could go to the races on Saturday. Why can't you go to the races Saturday, and work Sunday. If you don't come, I'll be all alone with Lewis and your mom Sunday morning. Who knows what kind of crazy stuff could happen.  For Mattson: have you gotten to the hidden cave in the Thunder Plains yet? It is the worst thing ever. Not only do you have to do a lot of math, but it takes forever. And you have to do it twice.

      I'll keep this short because I am tired and am watching  Spiderman .  After work yesterday I hung out with Chris, John, and Bryce. Chris got a  Specials  CD and a  Ramones  Greatest Hits comp. We went to the mall, and Bryce saw Hannah and Kali in the mall and tipped them off to my location. Now normally I don't mind seeing them, but they had a bunch of friends in tow, who made me uncomfortable. Within two minutes of meeting Hannah, Chris picked a shoe fight with her. He proceeded to tell all ten or so people to "fuck off," because Hannah said that he was from Pequot. Then he said that he was Nisswa's finest, that Brainerd sucked, that emo sucked, and that the people sucked. Now these jaded, cynical overachievers were all looking at each other and saying, "Is this kid for real?" It probably seemed wrong for these paragons of sophistication to be among anything real. Anyway, Chris asked if Kali was my girlfriend, and called Hannah and Kali pedophiles, finally making things sufficiently awkward enough to scare them away. I was pissed at Chris, for making it seem like I liked Kali to her, but I really deserved it after the Chris-Bryce "incident." So I forgave him.  I hate it when Chris says shit like that. He does it to almost everyone he meets, and it annoys the hell out of me. It seems like me and Chris have been crueler than usual to each other lately.  So that is what happened on Thursday.  One more thing about Thursday: We were in Best Buy, and John bought a  Death Cab  CD, and a  Coldplay  CD. Now, there are only two kinds of music I hate: emo and indie-snob rock. He said he was buying them for Pammy, but he still was participating in the active dissemination of my mortal enemies. This is shit that  Hobe  listens to.  Speaking of the Hobster, it is his birthday sometime around in this area.  I stayed over at the Oseland house last night. Today, me and Chris and Erik went in to town, went to the Salvation Army, and came back. I got a CD and some books for a really low price:  Brave New World, King Rat , and  The Glory and the Power  all for less than a dollar.  Me and Chris went over to Bryce's house tonight, as Erik was out chasing girls that we had no interest in, and found out we couldn't stay over. So after me and Chris rocked the house with an informal acoustic-electric guitar battle, we left.   Well, I'm heading back to  Spiderman , but I'll try to actually post tomorrow, if I am not busy.   Good night.  P.S.: I bought  Resevoir Dogs .

      You reall can't understand Wesley Willis until you hear him. My favorites are "Birdman Kicked My Ass" and "I Whipped Batman's Ass." Got to witness Chris try to hold his own while talking to Hanna and Kaly and some other former seniors. Quite funny with Chris yelling "Fuck you guys" and then Hanna just saying "He's from Pequot."  I've also decided my room needs some new wall furnishings. This redecoration process shall first begin with extensive research and then will end in a great ordering frenzy, probably on monday.

      It's really hard to convey the awesome beats of that song's lyrics into typing, and also the 'oh' doesn't really pull it's weight transcribed. No, I'm not MIA. Tuesday night I had nothing really to post about, like Mattson said. Wednesday night I was shot from Valleyfair - I didn't even check this place.   It would be great if I could add to that scavenger hunt list. I've racked my brain for days on end, thinking of things that would be awesome to hunt down and videotape, such as a human pyramid made of 6 foodservice employees, a doctor singing "Hakuna Matata," a member of your team insulting 4 different people and getting a reaction out of at least 1, and, the highest point amount, Adam Pelkey.   Camping is okay. I'm not a big fan of s'mores, which seem to take up 3/4 of my family's camping experience, and I'm not a big fan of throwing all mankind's technology and other advances over 10,000 some years out the window and "roughing it," but it's bearable.  Bryce is like memory retention... something... don't know where I'm going with this. His piano skills astound me, and he's had no formal training like myself. Rubiks cube... He programs his TI-83 often better than I, and I don't even know if he read the programming chapter in the manual. Maybe I just taught him real well. I'll lie that sweet lie to myself...  Wednesday I went to Valleyfair with the church and the absolute two people I least expected to come along... well, actually no, I'd less expect like Dan Rather or Al Sharpton...nevermind. Chris Oseland and Deutsch Niehoff were both there. Chris... not even gonna start there, but I though Deutsch was back in Deutschland. I guess not.   Galaxies and Beyond. Seriously, transcribe a raw draft and I'll throw my cuts and editorials in there too. We stretched that novel 123 pages at least... 4th thru 6th grade, oh man. With excellence to rival someone like Timothy Zahn. Or whoever wrote Rogue Squadron. No, that guy rocked. Whoever wrote Wraith Squadron. That's better. He's worse, is what I mean. Not saying Tim Zahn's bad, he's just the first Star Wars writer that came to mind.   My song picks... Tribute - Tenacious D Walking in Memphis - Billy Joel and Elton John (I don't have this one. Actually, I've never heard it. But Joe Henke has it on his iPod, and the two greatests artists to ever have lived plus an excellent song cannot be bad) Something Rod Stewart, I'm thinking You're In My Heart, the final reprise. or whatever Also the Beatles, right now I'm on sgt peppers lonely hearts club band, but that could easily change.  I'm off to tennis. Let's do something friday nite.

      Well, I am now 2/3 done with work this week. At about four tomorrow I'll be done and in town.   I'm tired. I hate blogging when I have to work the next day, because I can't just let my mind wander, and instead I try to force out what I want to say.  Oh...my blog mix song choices: the Soviettes- "Paranoia Cha-Cha-Cha" Jello Biafra with D.O.A.- "That's Progress!" Wesley Willis- "Fuck You" or "They Kicked Me Out of Church" the Casualties- "Made in NYC" the Clash- "Jimmy Jazz" I think I'll go with these. You may note that unlike John, I moved away from the proven classics to go with some relatively unheard tracks. (Unheard by you guys)  If I were in the Casualties, I'd spell that "trax."  Speaking of music, the Rock Against Bush Volume Two tracklisting was released today. Not only does it have a new DKM song (!) called  We Have the Power , it has live "trax" from the Souls (Born Free), and the Mad Caddies. Also, some mainstream bands are on it, who will contribute bad songs, just as the Offspring and NFG did on Volume One. Plus, T(I)NC, Foo Fighters, Hot Water Music, Dillinger Four, and the Dwarves are also contributing new songs. Oh yeah, Op and BR are on it. No new or rare stuff from them, sadly. It comes out in August.  But where are the Casualties? I might make fun of them a lot, but "Tomorrow Belongs to Us" would be a  great  song for this comp.  Houley is officially M.I.A. If he doesn't blog by four o'clock tomorrow, me and Chris are going over to his house to check if he is still alive.   Same deal with Hobe, who I haven't really done much with this summer. Maybe it is because he works a lot, maybe it is because he seems perpetually annoyed with me.   While wandering the net tonight I found that the Department of Minnesota actually has a Department of Rhetoric.  Well, I guess it isn't as outrageous as it first seemed.  Continuing his streak of horrible choices concerning Wheel of Time, Robert Jordan has decided that book eleven of the Wheel of Time will be named  Knife of Dreams . God, I hope I don't have to explain why that is a horrible name. Now I'll grant you, it is no  Galaxies and Beyond , but  Knife of Dreams ? Come on. It sounds like the name of a scenario from a D+D game that Matt Houle wrote or something.   What is the difference between   WoT  and  Galaxies ? In one, the authors realized that the last part sucked and quit. In the other, the author decided to plod on and continue to take out everything interesting that the series once had.  Which leads me to my next brilliant idea: Transcribing  Galaxies and Beyond , a little at a time, on to this blog. Soon the whole world will be able to view the literary genius that me and Houley birthed. Well, he was like the mother, because he actually birthed it. I more of impregnated him at the beginning and made him do all the work from there on out. Not only will I add an entry a night, but I will add in my author's commentary.  Prepare to have you face melted off by mind-blowing prose and razor-sharp dialogue!  I swear to God, if anyone mocks it, I will throw a brick through their window.  Good night. I'm off to edit  G+B .

      Narrowed down to: "Al's War" "Morning Star" "Kids and Heroes"  Well, well... What to do. This is quite a decision. I know what to do, it has to be done.  My new LIST IS: "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts" "Morning Star" "Kids and Heroes" "Boys On the Docks"  Yay   If  the list was expanded to 5 songs each, I would definately add "The Ballad of Johnny X."  It seems Mattson already has one of those songs. Sooo... my new list is: "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts" LTJ "Kids and Heroes" Bouncing Souls "Boys On the Docks" DKM "Gone" Bouncing Souls  But I really want to have "The Ballad of Johnny X" in there too though...  **EDIT**  God, I can't stand it. New list: "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts" LTJ "Kids and Heroes" Bouncing Souls "Boys On the Docks" DKM "The Ballad of Johnny X"

      My songs are: "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts" Less Than Jake "The Ballad of Johnny X" Bouncing Souls "Boys On the Docks" Dropkick Murphy and "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" Guns n' Roses or "Morning Star" A Fire Inside (AFI) or "Kids and Heroes" Bouncing Souls or "Al's War" Less Than Jake or "All My Best Friends Are Metalheads" Less Than Jake  Tough decisions.  Recently saw the movie "50 First Dates" with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. It was pretty funny. It was about Sandler falling in love with a girl (Barrymore) that cannot remember anything from the previous day because of a car accident. She works at a clinic for people with this problem. One of the things that made it funny was all the people from other Sandler movies that show up in it. It was a lot more than usual. Another thing that made it funny were the short memories. For example, this one guy (he has a 10 second memory) who was drawing a picture and says, "What was I doing?"  "You were drawing a picture."  "Oh," and he looks at his picture which is a little stick boy in a beany and says,"Holy shit, I fucking suck." I quit.

      Today it was coffee-fueled work, then home. I hung out with Bryce for a while. We went to Best Buy, and Kaddy was working. He gave me some advice on routers.  Digital Camera Fund: $120  I've picked my four songs for the blog mix. Well, I've narrowed it down to five. I'd rather wait and see what everyone else picks so my songs fit better within the context of the mix.  Folded some origami today. It takes me forever to do one thing, while Bryce can pump out a million swans and flowers in a few minutes. Bryce picks up on things faster than anyone I know; you only need to show him something once and after a while he can do it better than you.  Really, I've nothing to talk about tonight. I can't even do reactions to other posts because Houley didn't post today, and Jeff is boring.  And now for  urlLink something completely unrelated .  Today I bought the latest  Rolling Stone . In case you didn't know,  RS  has great non-music related articles in it. It is suprisingly leftist, though.  In  Spin  the other day I read something interesting (What a surprise!). It was about why kids listen to rap instead of rock these days. Rap, unlike rock, still glamourizes the lifestyle. In rock, it is all about getting clean, helping the world, being a good role model for the kids, etc. In rap, it is still about the money, the twenties, the forties, and the sixties. I bet that is why glam rock bands like the Darkness and Velvet Revolver are experiencing such a surge in popularity. Come on, the Darkness is a  horrible  band. I've never really enjoyed comtemporary rock and roll, with its simple lyrics, cliche band members, and lack of originality. And the  guitar solos . Jesus Christ, the guitar solos. Who wants to hear a 3 minute masturbatory solo by a guy who looks like all the blood vessels in his face are broken? I guess if you are some kind of air guitar  virtuoso  who wears a Van Halen T-Shirt every day, that is cool and musically interesting.   I've always found Led Zeppelin funny. You can't deny their talent. They  were  rock and roll. Drug fueled excess, jailbait, and John Bonham playing a drum solo with his  hands  on "Moby Dick." But I bet even during the mid-70's, at the height of their popularity, you could tell that the members of Zep would be bloated carcicatures of their former selves within a few years. In the 70's, before punk came around in the last few years, rock was  dying , and the bands tried to squeeze every last drop out of it before it flopped over, exhausted from the excesses of the sixties and seventies.  Still, I'd like to have a look at  How the West was Won  and  The Song Remains the Same .  I'm going to cut it short tonight. I'll blog a longer blog tomorrow.

      I went to Dodgeball last night, and saw Rad and some other guys from work there, so I hung out with them.  It was pretty good.  Last night I challenged him to a boxing match, and he accepted.    I really want to do this scavenger hunt with you guys.  I may be driving my Grandpa's old truck, just to Put miles on it before my Grandma sells it.  I like the truck and it goes pretty fast.  Also this Sunday/ Monday I think I may be at my cabin.  I got a .22 and cant wait to shoot stuff with it.  Let me know when the scavenger hunt is, if you decide to do it.  I have a car and video camera at my side.  My four songs are- Linkin Parks "Lying from you", Incubus "Megalomaniac", The Offspring "Americana", and The Blue Man Group "The Current"

      As you might have remembered, I have a scavenger hunt typed out and yet to be used. This is a three-months-ago Josh idea. I remember we didn't do it because it turned out to be the coldest day of the year.  Hawkeye, I invite you to everything that you would concievably come to. If we are calling everyone up, chances are I'll call you. If me and the Oselands are doing something, well, chances are you'd regret coming with us anyway.  Jeff, I just forget to call you. Houley went by your house the other day when we were going to the movie to invite you along, but you weren't there.  I don't really feel like blogging tonight, but I will anyway.  Of course we feel that we are inherently better than (most) other people. I feel that this is basic human nature. We are always on a high ground, be it morally or intellectually or musically, in my case. Think about it this way: How many people to you look up too, as opposed to how many people you look down on? How many people do you know that you trust their judgement over your own? You could clarify respect and admiration more clearly, though. I admire people like myself, but I also have great respect for people radically different than myself.   I am currently listening to:  Rock Against Bush Volume One . Some songs I like, some I hate. "Sink, Florida, Sink," by Against Me! is my favorite song on it I haven't heard, and Rx Bandits, Jello Biafra, Authority Zero, and the Soviettes also contribute great songs. Hell, even the Get Up Kids contribute something a little better than mediocre. My major pet peeves: the Descendents song, "Sad State of Affairs," sucks, and the Ataris contributed a blasphemous cover of "Heaven is Falling." Hearing one of my favorite BR songs sung by the Ataris was as depressing as hearing Simple Plan cover "American Jesus" during VWT. Also, Kris Roe butchers the vocals. I will allow that it was cool to hear it acoustic, even though I had already played it acoustic before to see what it sounded like.  I've got to work the next three days.   Oh yeah, I'm going to go ahead and make that blog mix. Contribute 4 songs you like, and I'll mix them up and force John to burn them in that exact order under pain of death.   Uhhh, camping. I hate to camp. Actually, I don't like going outside of my house with members of my family. I see them enough here. I don't like going on vacation.   Another thing about that Ataris cover: The whole point of an acoustic cover is to strip the song down to basics. They add a violin and some effects and it sounds horrible. Also, the recording quality is almost as bad as Tai Chi Bob's "A Stupid Demo to Show Your Friends."  Now, when I saw the Ataris at VWT I wasn't one of those throwing garbage at them (By saw, I mean listening in the background because I was talking with Roger of LTJ during their and AFI's sets. I wanted to see AFI, though.). I remembered  Broken Hearts... , and respected. I even got  So Long, Astoria , but all I found was MTV-friendly emo-pop.  Me and Chris and Bryce went swimming today. The cold dampened our enjoyment of it but didn't stop us from swimming for two and a half hours. Me and Chris got into the mother of all mud fights and Bryce got a weird orange rash. It was fun.  Later on I tried to get Chris to eat five bratwurst but he could only get three down. This, after he foolishly boasted that he could eat seven.  I have nothing else to say.   Good night.

      Actually, the website does prove that John Kerry is superior simply because he isn't Bush. Anyways, a scavenger hunt would be excellent. We could have all kinds of crazy things on it. It would be "cheap fun." Before we could do that, we need July 13th to roll around and that is a long ways off. Gotta work tomorrow and I don't feel like saying anything else.

      I've a proposition to make. Let's have some sort of scavenger hunt. It'd be brilliant. Let's do it with video cameras and a lot of people, so somebody might have to call up Jefe. Also, since Hawkeye's got a new car, it'd be great to do a lot of street racing and get it smashed up as fast as possible. My idea, at least.  Also, my personality type is Movie Star, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Taking the inkblot test revealed that my subconscious mind is ruled by curiosity. I liked that inkblot test.  Now for some intellectual banter: Most people really think of themselves as being better than others. Not necessarily because they are prejudiced against others, but basically because of differing morals. While everyone's moral base is about the same, finer points can be skewed drastically. People generally try to acheive their own individual morals, with varying levels of emphasis on differing points depending on the individual. Admiration comes from another person being closer to your morals than yourself.   I've a lot more on that, but that about sums it for the most part...  Also, John's website proves that John Kerry is NOT superior. Basically, what it's saying is that if the words 'John Kerry' were removed from the ballot and replaced with 'not Bush,' he would get the same amount of votes. Most people aren't pledged to him because they like him, they're pledged because he's not Bush. The two-party system... another horrible downfall of American politics. Seriously, I was watching the British House of Commons last night, those guys rock. Tony Blair is the greatest politician I've seen, even if he is too liberal. Okay, maybe I'm just caught in the moment. Still, Tony Blair is really cool.

      I wasn't around this weekend because I went camping.  Don't ask me where, all I know is that it was some place up north about 1 hr. away from here.  Just to let everyone know, tenting really isn't that great.  I say this because this was my first time tenting in all the times that my family went camping.  For the past who knows how long we've had a 29 foot pull type travel trailer that we went camping in but we sold it because we stopped using it that much.  The experience as a whole was rather good though, a sort of back to the basics journey.  I fished on Leech River and caught one very nice bass and about six good sized northerns.  The important thing about this trip is that I found out that I need a good sized hunting knife.  Or a small broadsword.  Either one.  It's really hard to peel the bark off of a branch with your fingers.  So one of these days I'll have to go to that little sword/taser shop that Mattson goes to and find one.  I can see what Jefe means about not being invited to anything.  I just started to get into the mix and Jefe has almost done less things than I have.  July 13th is slowly getting closer.  Drivers test.  I will finally be able to drive and not be stuck with Mattson all of the time(not implying that it's a bad thing).  So. . .that's all I did. . . later.           "sometimes you got to whip out all you got. . .and do it in the butt!"

      Father's Day. I didn't do anything with my dad, as I gave him his present yesterday. I woke up around two, showered, and headed out to my grandma's house. After no less than four of my relatives insinuated I was a girl, my mom vandalized my car. I  did , however, get some pie. Then, I left.  I've been playing guitar a lot lately. It seems to be an even better catharsis than blogging. Listening to music is probably the only thing that is more cathartic to me than guitar. I enjoy it, the simple task of setting my fingers in the right place for a chord. Instead of approaching the guitar with the passion for music I have, I instead started trying approaching it as a student, a workman. This seems to have improved my guitar playing, so I'll stick with it.  Due to me waking up late, I didn't get much accomplished.  I went to the late show with John and Pammy. The movie was  The Terminal , and I enjoyed it, even though it grated on me at the end.   Terminal  is a very sterile movie. The shots themselves remind me of a airport, clean and orderly, with a comforting conformity to everything. This bothered me throughout the whole movie. It does fit quite well with the movie, but you think such an acclaimed director would try something new and original. I suspect that good actors and scripts have led people to believe that Spielberg is a better director than he actually is. Tom Hanks is good in it, as usual. The awkwardness between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones  almost  felt real. It always bothers me when movie relationships seem natural, especially when the people first meet.   So that was my day.  I also was a Groundbreaking Documentary, both on Tickle and in real life twice as "The Josh Mattson Story", and as the crazy Hannah stalker video project (I don't know the real name).  Oh, and according to Tickle, I value religions that encourage open-mindedness.  I hope it is nice out tomorrow. I'd like to go swimming.  What is going on now? I don't really know anymore. I never have had a strong sense of self-identity. I just always believed I was what I was. Now, who knows? My life is like a living version of  Catch-22  where no one knows what the hell is going on. You know, I'm cool with that. I no longer fear the uncertain as much as I used to. I'm on a plateau, waiting for a big change.   I've always intellectually realized that I could die any time, but in my heart I don't really believe that. I can't imagine dying  ever . I'm not talking about my so-called immortal soul, I mean my physical body. It is hard to brood on something that seems so far away. But hey, when I was a little kid I figured I would be dead long before I was 16. Time plays funny tricks. Maybe in a short while I will realize that I am 40 and long to be 16 again.  Who wants to grow old? For that matter, who wants to grow up? I loathe responsiblity and I imagine that I always will.   Change  is the dirtiest word in any language.   On Chris Derby's blog: El Jefe: Holy Shit you are a whinner. I dont know you and I already hate you Chris: Fuck You Josh: That shit's wack, brah  I'm  much  too arrogant to fall into self-loathing, and Chris shouldn't either. We've had our differences, but he isn't such a bad guy. I used to hate everything too, until I realized that shit isn't going to change if I sit around and hate it so I might as well accept the things I can't change.   I'm glad I can go back and edit posts. I just deleted all of this here.  In other news, I hate pinball.  I hate it when you see people, but then you realize that it is just someone who looks like them. I go up and greet friends all the time only too realize that I don't know the person.  Well, I finished  Kavalier , which was quite good. I've now started to finish  Neuromancer , by William Gibson.  I've got nothing else to blog tonight, Raow.

      If I was a movie, I would be a Groundbreaking Documentary. My belief system is best suited to religions that value salvation from sin.  Find out  urlLink more.   Turns out I might not have Monday off. Too bad.  G'night and God bless.  Happy Father's Day, also.

      Well I went to the Reeds Store and was very impressed.  I had no idea that Ginny could talk to customers and work at the same time.  Everyone there has those goofy fishing vests'.  I want one.  I got a .22 from my Grandpa and went to find some bullets so I can shoot rats and cats in my neighborhood, maybe Mattson's windows.  I also looked at fishing stuff.  But the time I was there was very wasteful.  But it is a very nice pond, and I may have to check out there free fishing clinic's, you know- for my brother.  Work was very slow, and it took 6 hours to do all the prep we needed.  Rad wants to fight me- or box me.  He just got new gloves and wants to try them out.  Sometimes I want to hit him and it would be fun if I, in the unlikely chance of me winning, did kick some ass.  I have monday off, so we should do something.  I kind of want to play tennis, but I also want to sit in my basement with a 12 inch sub, bowl of you know what, and brewsky.

      2:05 A.M. The Internet is always on, no matter what time it is.  No matter what I do, the Earth will not spin off its axis and fly into Mars tomorrow. What a depressing thought.

      Prepare yourselves for the most boring blog ever blogged.  12:02: I wake up. 12:05: Eat breakfast (dry waffles) 12:07- 12:35: Surf Internet, comment on Derby's blog 12:35-12:43: I wander aimlessly, still not woke up 12:45-12:55: Read  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay . I realize that it is Father's Day tomorrow, and I am going to have to go outside today. I head for the shower. 1:23: Finish showering, brushing teeth, and putting clean clothes on. 1:31: Feed Lilly, leave house 1:38: Arrive downtown at  Antiques and Accents  1:43: Leave  Antiques and Accents  with my Father's Day present, a sort of metal cabinet thing with places to put junk. 1:43-2:01: I drive around, with no particular plan, hoping I will run into someone I know but not really in the mood to do anything. I then return home. 2:03: make Macaroni and Cheese, eat it 2:25: clean out and wash off metal cabinet, take back strut holder things off and throw them away, because they suck and detract from the aestheic quality the cabinet has 2:28-3:42: Read  Kavalier and Clay  3:42-4:40: I leave my house and head over to my mother's house for some food and stimulating conversation. My mom unsuccessfully tries to get me to attend church with her and Sam. I think about teaching Sam what I believe but decide that a few years with the Protestants will do him good. Suffering builds character, and Goats need all the character that they can get. 4:41-4:50: Drive home, singing because my tape deck is broken. 5:00-5:25: read some more  Kavalier  5:27-5:50: make yet another trip into town to water my grandma's tomato plant. I drink some hose water and it makes me feel sick. 6:05-6:38: play  Worms  6:40-8:50: Since there is nothing else to do, I get down with some serious jams on my acoustic guitar. I add  Should I Stay or Should I Go, Say Anything , and  You  to my repertoire. I also wrote songs named  One Chord Song, Two Chord Song, Three Chord Song, John is a Sellout, Techno Sucks, Go Drive Off a Bridge, If you listen to Blink-182 you must be a 13 year old girl, Country Sucks, A homeless man kicked me in the crotch (twice), I hope you get ran over by a Ford Thunderbird, Star Trek Sucks  and  I fought Adam Pelkey to the death.  Finally, I finished my crowning achievement,  A boy and his Jetpack.  Part rock opera, part emo song, part spoken word, it is bound to elicit strange new emotions in you. 8:52-9:07: more  Kavalier . 9:07-9:34: more jamming  9:36-10:40 drink hot chocolate and have serious discussion on the nature of art with Lilly. Also, I have the most brilliant thought I have ever thought on a entirely unrelated subject. 10:40-11:42 yet more  Kavalier . 11:44-11:58: shower, brush teeth 12:03-12:32: Read Sunday's  Dispatch  In all honesty, I have a few hours of activity left but I am sick of writing things down.  I have checked out Bowling for Liars before, and I know some of the claims to be untrue. Actually, I saw a whole thing about Michael Moore and websites like those on Free Speech TV. (9415 on Satellite) Anyway, I know that Michael Moore exaggerates, unfairly edits, makes claims to get attention. But that doesn't mean that he isn't right most of the time. Besides, it is nothing compared to the repeated lies by some conservatives (Ann Coulter, FOX News). The Al Franken website springs out of the neo-con's hatred of Al.   Me and John don't have to work until Tuesday, actually.  I felt the same way about Harry Potter, except for the blasphemous hand-touching of Ron and Hermoine. I almost walked out when I saw this, walked out and puked my guts out.  Obviously  Ron and Hermoine are just friends. Hermoine's got that Ruskie, and Ron gets a crush on that French girl if I remember my Potterology correctly.  Ah, the mall. Why do I hate the mall? First of all, everything there is overpriced. Second of all, the people who hang out there suck. But most importantly is because of stores like Hot Topic.   Back in my day (last summer), you got into punk through  music , not clothing. Now I wouldn't say that I dress outrageously. In fact I would say that I dress quite moderately. Yes, our clothing reflects our punkness, but we aren't punk because of how we dress. It is just us following our tradition and emulating our idols, as many types of people do. But now you have Good Charlotte or Nofx fans walking into a Hot Topic, buying some studded bracelets and some T-shirts, and calling themselves "punks." I abhor this. I hate how corporations exploit whatever is "cool" at the moment, taking everything we love and trying to peddle it to other people by suggesting that they will be more popular and credible if they wear their gear. In fact every type of person whose scene has been exploited by Hot Topic hates it. In my English class, I had a bunch of girls who would be called "goths" by people who knew less. To them, it was just the way they were. They hated a bunch of fake attention whores telling them, "Yeah, I got this at Hot Topic! I feel real sinister and stuff now!" This brings me back to my disdain for the psuedos. They get some Rancid, Casualties, and Mxpx shirts and feel like real rebels when in truth they haven't taken the time to find out what they are getting into, what the philosophy and the meaning behind the word "punk" is. I know everyone has got to start somewhere, but I didn't get into punk through wearing Nofx t-shirts, the Oselands didn't get into punk through having mohawks, Alex didn't get into punk by wearing zipper pants. We are punks because we believed those ideas before we found punk rock, we just didn't have a name for it. You can learn about punk while still keeping your self-respect and dignity.  I don't want to be told what is cool by MTV. I don't want to be my scene to be torn into easily-digestible pieces and sold in malls to unassuming kids. I don't want for the hockey players in my school to set a precendent for all the other kids to follow. I don't want to use the word "doneski" when I speak. I don't want to pass up life and experience and instead be taught by corporations how to think. I don't want to hear JT's new single. I don't want to eat at McDonalds. I don't want to learn punk from some kid at my school who thinks that he is rebelling because heard Good Charlotte sing, "I don't wanna be you." I don't want to be a part of a clique. I don't want to be assumed anti-social just because I find most of the people at my school vapid and boring.  I want to decide for myself.

      I'm expecting it to be an attack on the facist mall, or something against emo bands and alex proctor. I dunno, somehow that poor person always ends up the butt of whatever Mattson's rage turns on next.   Before I forget...  urlLink Bowling For Truth   urlLink LyingLiar.com   Check 'em out.   Also, Dodgeball doesn't look bad... I just really wanted to see the Terminal, which ended up being a good decision, as it is a genius film. I can't put my finger on what I loved so much about it. It had a compelling plot, and was very funny in all the right places. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are geniuses.   Harry Potter... first of all, I was just digesting The Terminal. Secondly, the whole book and therefore movie was set largely as a mystery, around Sirius Black... I already knew the ending. It was still good, but in a Titanic sort of way, where it was like I'd already been there. But it was still good. Still good.  Monday I've the day off, but I guess m-son and john are working. We ought do something. Wednesday I'm going to Valleyfair. Furthermore, Hobester turns 17. That's just crazy.   And I'm spent.

      Friday night, I believe.  Well, it actually might be Saturday. I can't remember, let me check.  OK, it's Friday.   Not much going on today. Me + Chris + Erik continued our search for Wesley Willis CDs, I got a copy of Erik's band's new EP and we went to  Dodgeball . I wasn't expecting much, but I felt it justified my decision to spend $6.50 on it.   I saw a 4 megapixel camera at Best Buy today for only $250, and that struck me as good enough to buy. Four megapixels is actually pretty good. I don't particularly care about technology specifics, so I didn't find out anything else.   Everywhere  we went today seemed to be packed with friends and acquaintances, be it Best Buy or Nisswa or the movies. Hobe and Houley decided to go to  The Terminal , which sucked because I wanted to see that at a later date. Houley didn't want to see  Dodgeball  and it didn't fit with Hobster's precious notions of maturity.   Some jock asshole tried to pick a fight with Chris today at Subway. It was funny because Chris made him look totally stupid. First he said, "I'm going to kick your ass," and Chris said, "What is that going to prove?" As he walked out he called Chris a "fag" and Chris asked him if he was homophobic.  The blog has been boring for the past few days. I don't know if it has been because Jeff returned, or what, but we need some  excitement .  ADITLO to me is kind of a recap of my day, kind of a place to think out loud, and kind of a place to say things that I said during the day but no one was around to hear.  So twenty-ish days have passed this summer, what have we accomplished? I tend to look at summer as kind of a 90 day long version of the movie  The Breakfast Club , where we do things and suffer from some self-identity problems, but at the end we realize we are alright. Tons of fun, but no changes, as far as I can see.   Yeah, but aren't we always on the verge of discovering some important self-truth? It all boils down to when we discover that we either are or aren't alright. If you discover that you  aren't , chances are that you've been listening to too much emo. That is a facet of the complex and shining gem that is my life philosophy. Deep down, chances are that you're cool, and I hope you're cool with that. I know I've beaten the "Do your own thing" deal too much, but it can't hurt to say it one more time. Do your own thing.  I don't have many future plans for this summer. Actually, I am going to write a list right now: Continue to spend money frivolously Attend Warped Tour, heckle sellouts there Keep the fashion revolution rolling Be nicer to my mom (well, I probably won't) Stress the importance of free will and music in my long-winded, self-important blogs Sleep 12 hours a day Heckle sellouts in my hometown and in close towns and townships (i.e. Nisswa, John's house) Get matching "the Casualties: NYC Punk Rock Chaos" lighters with Chris (his white, mine black), start some sort of Casualties Army superhero team where we light them, hold them together, and say "Jorge! Grant us the power to fight sellouts and Guard Dogs!"  Attend other concerts Help bring down the already self-destructing Brainerd Lakes emo scene Remember that every day is historically and personally meaningful, regardless of what I do (or don't do)  I bet I sleep at least 43 days out of the summer. According to the office calculator, 43*24=1032 hours.  So me and Chris started this blues-rock band the other day, with me on "vox" and Chris on harmonica. Basically, Chris riffs while I sing about having the various veneral-disease related blues. It was quite funny, until Erik took the harmonica and threw it in the lake because we were playing "Junk-rot Blues" while he was talking to his girlfriend. Oh, and Chris skitched behind Erik's car while playing the harmonica before this happened.  I was going to say something about the mall, but it is probably too long to post tonight. So I'll get to it some other time, and those who want to comment on the mall can gather their thoughts.  Why are flags still flying at half-mast? Didn't Ronnie's week of mourning end a while ago? I commented on this to the lady at the bank and she gave me a sucker.    Fahrenheit 911  starts playing next Friday. Of course, it won't be playing in Brainerd. I asked the nice Rastafarian fellow at the ticket counter why not, and he said that it wouldn't pull in enough money, and I claimed that the owners of Movies Ten were fascist pigs, and he said that they probably were. When the revolution hits full speed, I'll let him be in charge of movie booking.   I know Michael Moore is a showman who is hungry for attention, but he  is  quite a clever filmmaker. The "Sewer Gremlin," as Chris calls him, brings up valid points and makes entertaining movies. Also, it seems like a long time ago  Stupid White Men  got me into political activism, so I feel in debt to him.  I'm done. See ya tomorrow, or the next day, or in three weeks.

      Slow down everyone.  I will out post everyone.    Yes, Bush sucks, so does Kerry, and just about everyone else that is running.  Thats way I have promised to vote to Nator when I am 20.  I finally got my spanish dictionary.  I have to write 4 essay's in spanish for the damn class next year.  Damn teacher, damn class, damn John.  Why don't you guys call me when you do shit.  I only work like 30 hours a week.

      Well, yeah, 100 posts. Although, after this time, a more appropriate title would be  Josh Mattson rants about... stuff, and not letting the Man get you down. Also, Houley and "AnalyzeThis" occaisionally post.   What I mean is that I dislike Kerry about as much as I do Bush. If he is elected, he will very probably run again in 2008, which would force me, therefore, to vote Republican just because John Kerry is a doosh. I also feel much of America would feel the same way, in that a large part of Kerry's support comes simply from antipathy to Bush.  I heard someone, maybe Bill Maher, say that large portions of Americans already have their minds made up as to who they will vote for. It will be a small swing amount in the middle that determines the winner of this race, and they will not be swayed until the bitter end. It's sad that elections are not fought on basic values like they should, but instead on political climate in a country.   I'm also at a lack of anything intellectually stimulating, but I decide not to rant and rave about it... until something comes up...

      Since I had to work again today, I didn't do anything. I'll get the fun train rolling again tomorrow. I don't know why I have to put everything together.  Work. It isn't the bad place John makes it out to be, it is just him exaggerating like he usually does. But hey, look who's talking. The people that work there aren't bad for the most part. It kind of depresses me because it seems that the Dairison is as far as they will go in life. What kind of life is shuffling between fast food and home?   That is why I don't work much. Well, 18 hours is a lot to me, but I'm saving for digital camera/VWT and after that I'll cut back. I hate the idea of having no free time. What is the point of having a summer if you have to work all the time?   Money comes and goes, possessions are fleeting, blah, blah, blah.   Seriously, the life experience I get just hanging out is much more valuable to me than the check I get every week.  Wow, the idea well is dry tonight.  Today on Nationstates telegrammed me asking me if I was a "peace punk" or a "riot punk." What a stupid question, I replied. Obviously social change is only going to come through peaceful methods, and not through your misguided ideas of "anarchy." When there is no government, who will run our hospitals, our schools, our federal aid programs, etc? People who care about America enough to be stuck in a dead-end bureaucratic job fort 25 years?  Who will protect us from the towelheads?  On a more personal note, my mood seems to worsen every day. I seem to be slipping back into that pit of sarcasm and apathy that I worked so hard to climb out of. I don't know why, either. I just am. My mood swings weirdly during the school year, but usually everything is copacetic in the summer.  Today in Derby's blog he said he didn't want to talk about something in his blog. Well, why not? Blogs are supposed to be personal, especially if you are tempted to dismiss everything out-of-hand when in person. The white space here brings out thoughts I don't usually think, I find.  I don't like being suprised, and when someone tells me something I hadn't been expecting, my natural reaction is to get mad. I've noticed when I get suprised, I don't handle it with my usual aplomb.  I also dislike being asked loaded questions. This is possibly the worst way to argue ever concieved.  I wasn't challenged at all today (except as Clash Champion) personally, or ideologically. That bothers me. I hate days when I don't have to think, and I'm going to pick a fight with someone tomorrow if I am not intellectually stimulated soon. I think top-form Josh comes out when I am being told I am wrong, or called bitter, or a nerd, or a psuedopunk, or whatever. I am good at arguing because I did it virtually every day for years, both logically and illogically. Fight to Live, as the Bouncing Souls say. Conflict is the spice of life.   Day to day living is too interesting for me to take. I'm serious, too. I remember in past years weeks would go by before I left my room. I wished my neighbor's house would blow up or something so I had a reason to leave my house. I probably don't have any more friends now than I did then, and I know I don't like them more now.   Maybe my whole outlook has changed. Maybe I'm a honest-to-God optimist now, and can see the point in everything. Optimist isn't the correct word. It's like I can see inside the machine now, see how all the cogs and gears fit together, and I know that  everything  has a point, so it doesn't matter what I do. It is probably the most comforting idea I've ever had.  I recently found out that the mall is like the ultimate socialization point for people. I don't like to go there, except for the bookstore which I enter through the side doors. There was the aforementioned people I saw yesterday, and today I saw two people from school I didn't care to talk to and Chrys Mathison at FYE. He is a pretty good guy, I worked on a few packages with him in TV Pro.   Well, I'm sick of blogging. That's all for tonight,   Raow

      Yes, Josh was looking  so   hot  yesterday that he was starting to infringe on territory formerly occupied only by Alex Proctor. If Proctor ever gets kicked out of that territory, he is in for a long ride on the Emo Express.  So, let me tell you a little about the place I work. I will use today as an example. In the morning, it was Lewis, Josh, Nancy, and myself. Now, Lewis does nothing. Everyone thinks he does work, but if you watch carefully, he actually does nothing all day. Then Josh; Josh hides in the drive-through. Sometimes, he adventures out to cut up some boxes or maybe fold towels but not to much else. Nancy is usually busy doing something like counting boxes of ice cream or doing the paper work that Sandy should be doing but isn't because Sam-Sam has an ear infection. Sometimes, we also get to work with Bailey who just demands stuff and does nothing. Sometimes we can get her to do all the shitty jobs though. Now, later on today, the stalker came in. Stephany is perhaps the creepiest person that works at the Dairison. She will relentlessly follow you around and try to talk to you even though you have made it clear you think she is a dumbass. Also, Megan came in today. Megan ends up standing with her arms crossed and doing nothing most of the time. While some people may say it is because she started yesterday, I say it is because she is retarded. I know if I did that on my second day I would have had Andy or Lewis harassing me. No matter who works there though, I am happy. This is because Nick is gone and Nick was equivalent to Satan. A Satan that didn't do anything.  Back to John Kerry. No matter what anyone says, he is a BIG HUGANTIC step up from Bush. PERIOD. And Jason, your theory of two new candidates in 4 years makes no sense to me. So, you would rather have two new people run for President in 2008 (even though this isn't guaranteed) than have the Chief of Dumbasses kicked out after four horrible (and unearned) years of Presidentialtude?

      Well, I just was blogging a second ago and my computer crashed. I'm pissed.  You probably all know my side on this "debate." I stand on the side of truth and justice, and unfortunately neither of the candidates stand on this side. It is really a choice between a corporate Democrat and a corporate Republican. But Bush is one of the worst Presidents in the history of America, and even if Kerry is only  slightly  better, it is a step in the right direction. After Kerry is elected, our focus will shift to keep progressing towards a better America, and repairing the damage Bush made in our civil liberties and relationships with the global community. I hate to be pessimistic about politics, but how much farther will we go? I will keep fighting for change, but unless the majority of the American public wakes up far-sweeping change will be hard to put in place.  Because I haven't in a couple months, I read Dan Holbrook's blog today. He said something along the lines of "treat the people that I liked like I liked them." An obvious concept, but one that struck me as one of my major problems. I don't know if I appear naturally indifferent, or what, but people seem to get the impression that I hate them. I don't.   Me and John had to work today, and it was a long 7 hours. Nothing much happened, and after work sucked. I did absolutely nothing except read the paper. To worsen my mood, it started raining. Kali called me and asked if I wanted to come hang out with her and Hannah, and I thought about it but decided that I wasn't really in a mood to do anything, I just was looking for something to complain about. So I respectfully declined and instead went over to my mom's house in search or pie and Pokemon. I couldn't find either, so I went to Best Buy to look for Pokemon. It was closed right when I got there, and again I felt let down.  Here is a convoluted story for you: Today I saw Bryce, his girlfriend, and his sister at the bookstore.  But that isn't the right place to start the story. Hold on. Terry told Chris that he 'has a chip on his shoulder from hanging around with that Bryce kid,' because he thinks Bryce is poor. Being the good conservative soldier he is, he thinks poor people, women, minorities, and non-Christians are inferior to him. Oh, and he hates homosexuals, I bet. So anyway Chris freaks out and calls PD a bigot, a racist, and some other words I won't mention. Chris gets grounded for it. The stupid thing is that Bryce is like the most laid back person in history and I have never seen him pick a fight with anyone. I told Bryce about it, and he just took it in stride. PD also distrusts us- he always thinks we are doing drugs or drinking or smoking. Although we have told him over and over we don't believe in that shit, he still is waaay too suspicious.   Parents, the reason that your kids are never home is because they don't like sitting at home. Simple as that. They aren't coke fiends, aren't out driving drunk, aren't out picking fights. The kids are alright, and the reason kids get mad at parents is their lack of trust. Just keep 'innocent until proven guilty' in mind, OK?  I like books I don't get. Have you ever read a book like that? I was just reading one. It was called  Survivor , by Chuck Palahuik. Other goodies are  Catch-22  and  American Gods . Ok, I understood  Gods , but it was weird.  I had this idea today that I could document everything I did in one day for the blog. I could take notes and the minutes and whatnot. Actually, I think that is a good idea and I am going to do it on Friday.   Joey is dead (cancer), Dee Dee is dead (drug overdose), and now Johnny is on his way (cancer).  When the Ramones are gone, who will be left from the first wave of punk? Joe is gone, Sid is gone, Johnny Rotten sucks, and now 3/4 of the Ramones are dead or dying.  What I bought today: 10.00 Gas Punk-O-Rama 9 (with free DVD!) Alternative Press magazine  I don't like AP because it represents everything I hate about corporate rock taking over punk. It always has a shitty band on the cover, and the AP top ten is half emo/half pop-punk. Once in a while, it covers the bands I like, so I buy it. But I still hate myself every time I buy it.   What if we burned a blog mix? Wouldn't that be cool? Split 20 songs 6 ways? It would reflect our diverse tastes. Yeah, that'd be cool.   I like Atom and his Package, and I'll throw a brick at anyone who calls Atom emo.   I reference emo way too much here.  Hey, Creed broke up.   All this bubbling outrage and sarcasm has built up inside me, and I can't even remember what caused it. It was really funny too, because I remember I kept laughing when I was driving around today.  Jeff made a comment on Derby's blog today insinuating that he needs to "get out more." Now I'm don't exactly stalk Jeff, but I'm pretty sure he has two modes: work and home.    Anyone know any other good blogs? I like reading them.  I now feel like today was a success. It seems now that every day is a success to me. You see, a loosely connected group of people, agencies, and governments I call "The Man" is always trying to keep me down. Every day I still exist I spit in The Man's face. I enjoy the thought that I really  am  a revolutionary, that every day I am alive there is still hope for freedom, democracy, and fashion.   Speaking of fashion, it seems that the revolution is finally starting to catch on. Today Bryce's girlfriend told me that she liked my shoes. Everyone says that. But hey, I  was  looking hot today. I was rapidly approaching teen-heartthrob status, and I had to contain that inside my house lest Hannah or Kali start in on their "Josh Mattson" talk.   Well, I didn't go anywhere tonight. There is always tomorrow.   Don't let The Man get you down.

      ADMIT IT! What is wrong with Kerry? Nothing, he is fine, not the best choice but still better than whatever the Republicans have picked. What have they picked? A moron? A liar? Both of these things and more. What good qualities does he have exactly? Not to many. Well, depending on who you are... For example, Dick probably loves how easy he is to control. I don't know what anyone else sees in him.

      I don't like Dubya any more than Kerry. But that's still pretty poor. As I've said, I hope Dubya gets elected now so I've 2 fresh ones to pick in '08 instead of being forced Republican by Kerry's presidency. It might also get some of those old croaker judges out of there. And I think Dubya stands a chance, being as it was about the worst possible political climate in the spring and Kerry couldn't gain any more than he had. Now that gas is going down and the economy is going up, Bush is bound to make gains by November.  Whatever.

      Jesus Christ. Don't talk about John Kerry. ANYONE IS BETTER THAN GEORGE DUBYA. Good lord. Aaaahhhh... I mean, not that George has enough money... He can always use more. Besides that, I have to work 19 HOURS THIS WEEK. That is so much. Nevermind about that, back to George. HE SUCKS. He is stupid, he can't talk, he is from Texas, he is best friends with the Saudi Arabian royal family... My hate for him cannot be expressed over a blog. I quit.

      Really. I'm on for 8 hours today, like 7 tomorrow, then 8 again on thursday, along with tennis tonite and thursday nite.   Furthermore, there's no way they  could  remove the clause from the pledge. It's no technicality - the man who wanted it removed "for his daughter" is not in legal control of her at all. They are in the middle of a custody battle between the man and his wife, who wants her daughter to say the pledge, "under God" inclusive. Not only would the removal of all notion of religion being removed from America as we know it cause legal reindoctrination of all who say the pledge, but furthermore reprinting of billions of dollars, not to mention a horrid revamping of all and everything associated with timekeeping, especially since many days and months were named after gods and whatnot, and we surely can't have that. Rename the planets, chuck out the Declaration of Independence while we're at it, or at least slice it up and take out "all men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable Rights" and "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence."   Beyond this, nobody's forcing you to say the pledge, so settle down, cheech. I'm not sure I ever saw Lade say it, and Wang told us he didn't. Not to mention how Nick Nathan deliberately left out the clause himself, which is his own matter of opinion not to mention just being retarded, and also threw off our canter, especially El Jefe till he learned to ignore him. May I remind you this is also the guy who ran around the room hectically throwing out pencils. That was hilarious.  Furthermore, this God is the same that is admittedly followed by no less than 78.3% of the country as of 2001, quite possibly more after 9/11.  urlLink http://www.gc.cuny.edu/studies/key_findings.htm   In short, 3/4 of the nation may easily become outraged if the clause was removed. Not to mention the illegality of the sue in the first place; there was no way the justices could do anything about it.  Also, when considering very wealthy politicians who claim to know whats good for the common person...  Let's look at who we're supporting in 2004? Eh?

      I've gotta work for the next three days. That doesn't bother me, but getting up at 8:30 for three days in a row does. I hate getting up early, hate being deprived of precious sleep. I'm going to have to go to bed in like two hours and drink black coffee tomorrow.  I think best after midnight, and it makes me mad that I have to blog before my ideas start to flow.  But hey, I do get paid tomorrow. I'm thinking of saving for either a CD deck or a digital camera, and I think I'll go with the camera. It'll also be a nice experiment in self-control to see if I can go three weeks without spending all of my money. I want to get one of those cameras that automatically load your pictures onto the computer when you put it in the cradle. My grandma has one and it is really cool.  Nothing really went down today. I only left my house once, to take out the garbage. It is a shame, because it was so nice out, but I didn't feel like calling someone and then spending three hours trying to find something to do.  I thought about rearranging my room again. I moved some stuff around to make it seem more open, but it still seems cluttered to me. I modernized it, and took out most of the stuff I don't use, but it still feels disarrayed to me. When I first moved in, I took a minimalist approach to it, but now I have shelves and desks and chairs and bookcases everywhere and there is no open space.  In other news, I've got more CDs now than my three cases can hold and eight or so are laying around my floor. I'll probably one huge one to hold all of them together.  A couple random things off  urlLink Yahoo! News :   urlLink Supreme Court allows 'Under God' on Technicality : Come on, guys (and girls). Stop forcing your conservative views on us. It is clearly unconstitutional to have it in there, as is making us actually say the pledge in school. It is the same deal with "In God We Trust" on money. That doesn't represent all Americans, as a lot of them clearly  don't  trust in the Christian God the money refers to. Also, to sidestep the issue by dismissing it on a technicality is cowardly.   urlLink 2003 Report discloses Senator's Wealth  What happened to representative government? Why do people keep electing senators who might have other than their constituents interests in mind? Obviously a millionaire has a different idea of what is good for the people than a working class person.  Tomorrow, I'm going to buy some gas for the wagon, and a copy of the new  Spin . I don't exactly enjoy listening to the majority of the bands in  Spin , as they normally only cover the current darlings of the music world, be it the Strokes, the White Stripes, Outkast, Death Cab for Cutie, or Franz Ferdinand.  The emo-rap revolution has started. Yes, I am talking about the abomination that calls itself Atmosphere. Even though Erik pretends to enjoy it, he probably was just turned on to it by his girlfriend and pretends to like it.  I've been thinking about what the hipsters are going to jump on during the next school year. I hope it is indie, so I won't have to hear about how great emo is anymore and the "punks" such as Rozy's gang will get off my beloved punk, but I had a thought the other day that ska is poised to explode. I've already heard of bands like Friendly C referencing it at their shows, although I didn't witness it myself, and I can't really remember a time when people were into it. Most of the so-called ska fans at our school listen to borderline ska such as Suicide Machines, or reggae-skaish music like Sublime. It isn't a hostile scene to get into, and I can see people listening to some LTJ and proclaming that they are "Rudies." I enjoy ska but I but I prefer bands that mix sounds, like I said yesterday. Pop-ska fans would seem like the worst sort of blasphemy to Chris, because he jealously guards it as one of the few untainted scenes.   Ehh, not much to write about today. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on.   In fact, I think I am done now. I've got stuff to do before I sleep.

      When Jason was talking about the backspace key, I remembered all the good jokes we used to have about Matt. The ones where when he was trying to hook up the scanner and couldn't find the right plug-in, so he made his own. I loved those jokes. Now, we have moved on to Matt and HALO jokes. Personally, I love Pokemon. Even though Pokemon sucks, I still love it. That is why I have the Pokemon Movie CD. I'm to lazy to say anything else.

      Wow. Within the hour, I've had the experience of a lifetime. I was down hitting some serves at Lauren Thompson park when five guys asked me if I wanted to play some basketball, 3-on-3. I warned them I wasn't good but they needed even teams so I put my tennis stuff aside. My team actually won 3 games, despite my poor performance. Then two other guys showed up- Mike Elder and none other than Nate Lucas. Wearing loafers. I was suddenly no longer the worst player on the court. Lucas was against me, and I was pitted against him to guard him. Not that he took a lot of shots...  Then he took off his shirt. It just got funnier. One time, he jumped, kicking his heels up behind himself, looked for someone to pass it to, and, finding nobody, just landed. It was pretty funny. My team went 5-0 before we broke up.   In further news, I had the day off so I finished Stranger in a Strange Land. It'll take a good while to digest. I'm moving on through the rest of his stuff.   The Pokeddiction... I don't know why. Maybe its the suspense. A good question to analyze is: why did it lose it's appeal? School stamped it out... we were moving on. It became a childish thing. It was expensive. But like all fads, it was us that outgrew it. It didn't change, and still hasn't. Much like Zelda. These games are great. Haven't changed - we have. Maybe our reason for leaving Pokemon always left something to be desired, a need for a finality to it that was never reached.   Also, I heard an interesting story about a young woman with which we are all acquainted coming into an automobile incident with another driver who left the scene, going to a certain Saint Joseph's Medical Center wherein he lies bedridden for life. And by bedridden for life I mean he was treated and released. But still, Pammy... oops, you didn't here it from me. Now where's that backspace key? Hmm, looks like Matt Houle salvaged it or something. Anyways, this certain young woman crashed her car, probably worse than even Mattson ever has.  My brains kind of on drugs so... g'night.

      I haven't been home for a few days, so I haven't blogged at all. Sorry. I know I bring this blog some much-needed class.  Today I was overwhelmed by e-mail. I had 36 new emails, and I just couldn't deal with it. So I deleted it all. So if you sent me something relevant, please go ahead and send it again.  The Chris I usually refer to is Chris Oseland, my best friend/mortal enemy.  I've been a Clash fan for a while, but not a hardcore fan until about six months ago. My uncle gave me a copy of  Combat Rock  three years ago, and I've dug that for a while, and I have a bunch of assorted Clash songs on my computer. Now I've been buying all the CDs I don't own and Joe's work with the Mescaleros.   I like it when bands mix genres, man. All my favorite bands do (did) it, be it Bad Religion mixing hardcore with melodious folk-punk, Operation Ivy mixing ska and punk, or the Clash and Sublime mixing ska and reggae and punk. Great bands try new things, and you can forgive the occasional misstep (BR's  Into the Unknown  is an example).  I bought these aviator shades at the flea market the other day, and I love them. I wear them everywhere, including at night and inside. The aviators are  magical , and I don't even care that they make me look like G.G. Allin.   Since we are on the topic, lets talk about fashion. In case you haven't heard, I started a fashion revolution. I am quite the dresser, from my shades to my shoes, which make people turn away in awe when I walk down the street. Being the revolutionary  fashionista  that I am, people try to rip off my look and leech off my incurable sense of style. Those people (who will remain unmentioned) should go throw themselves off a tall cliff.  I can't even remember what I was going to blog about tonight. My thoughts wander everywhere tonight, and even typing is a chore.  We (we being myself, Houley, Hobe, and John) went to the late show tonight. John, as he is apt to do, bailed on us. Hobe knew the cashier so we got free passes to  The Day After Tomorrow . After arguing for a while we decided to go to  The Stepford Wives , which blew my mind with it's implausability. One of my pet peeves are glaring plot holes in movies, and  TSW  had plenty. I didn't even understand the ending, but the movie entertained the hell out of me. But isn't that why we go to movies? To laugh at someone being electrocuted from kissing a robot head?  Today me and the Oselands went to Best Buy, to browse their facist shelves for new music. We settled on Wesley Willis. In case you haven't heard, Wesley Willis is the  goddamn man . I can't even explain how weird/awesome it is. But anyway, Best Buy didn't have any Wesley Willis CDs. So we went on their website, which plays music pretty loudly through the Best Buy music section's speakers, and blasted  Chronic Schizophrenia . That was the highlight of my day, hearing the Daddy of Rock and Roll being blasted in all his crazy glory. Then we were told to turn it down, and Erik turned on  Fuck You  and we ran out. Ah, to be a hooligan again.   I was looking for my Pokemon game today, but I think I threw it a while ago after I realized that the Japanese stole countless hours of my precious childhood.  What is it with the pressure put on us to join in on the latest fad? I don't want to be told what is cool by corporations. I want to decide for myself. The Man is always keeping me down by telling me that I haven't started a revolution, that I haven't lit a fire in the collective hearts of the youth by wearing cut-off pajamas and checkered shoes. Fuck off, man. I'm not going to wear Hollister or Abercrombie and Fitch or whatever is "cool" and can be found in our local mall. I'm going to keep wearing my Erik-made zip-up and band shirts. I am going to overthrow your hateful mall clothes.   On the subject of clothes, I bought a shirt that proclaims that "Emo Sucks." A bold statement, I know, and I hope that it offends every emo fan I meet, including Hobe and the stalkers. Emo is like pop-indie. No, that is not a fair statement. Never mind.   Is it wrong for me to believe I am awesome? I come across as a jerk, but that is probably just because I am one. If you believe you rock with all your heart, you rock. If you can remove all that self-doubt from yourself, you will be a lot better off. Don't be afraid of looking stupid or coming across as a jerk. All you have to believe is that you can do  anything , and you will. Yeah! Self-Empowerment!  John finally burned me the mix I asked for. I admit it was partially my fault. Here is the tracklisting, along with commentary: 1. Bad Religion- "I want to conquer the world" Quite simply the greatest song ever written. It rocks, rolls, has wicked solos, and has a important meaning. 2. The Clash- "Hateful" Not my favorite Clash song, but it fits well within the mix. 3. Minor Threat- "Filler" The part at the beginning, when Ian McKaye yells, "What happened to you? You're not the same," gets me everytime. 4. Mustard Plug- "Box" Ska! 5. Nirvana- "About a Girl" Back when Kurt Cobain made honest music, Nirvana was actually quite a good band. They never get the hype where they deserve it. I won't call Nirvana revolutionary or anything, because they just mixed punk and the Pixies together and applied it to corporate rock. You can hear Kurt at his best on  Unplugged , because you can feel the emotion in the songs. 6. TSOL- "Code Blue" Well, everyone hates this song, even though it rocks. Necrophelia is a great idea to put to a punk song. 7. AFI- "Morningstar" I couldn't remember the name of the AFI song I  really  wanted, so I picked this one. Before Davey Havok wrote the MTV-friendly  Sing the Sorrow , he wrote music that sounded new everytime you heard it. Plus, this is a great song. 8. Weezer- "Only in Dreams" The greatest emo song ever written. 9. Operation Ivy- "Bad Town" Often imitated but never replaced, Op was the quissential ska-punk band that came in the wake of the Clash. This song always makes me think of Brainerd. 10. Dropkick Murphys- "Far Away Coast" I dig DKM's acoustic stuff. When the scum is rubbed off Barr's voice, it really shines. 11. Atom and his Package- "Punk Rock Academy" This is how I feel about high school.  12. Bad Religion- "Sorrow" BR's songs are always complex and deal with subjects deeper than girls, and this is another of my favorites. 13. Dead Kennedys- "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" When I saw Jello say, "What are you rebelling against?" in the  In God We Trust, Inc  DVD, it summed up how I feel about the pop-punks at my school. 14. Bouncing Souls- "Manthem" A tribute to all the fun I have with the Oselands. 15. The Doors- "Hello, I Love You" I hate aimless acid-rock, but the Doors have always appealed to me. Plus, this is a good summer song. 16. U.S. Bombs- "Jaks" When me and the Oselands head out the door, sometimes I get this feeling that we are going to destroy everything, tear down all the normal power and social structures. This song evokes the same feeling in me. 17. Jack Johnson- "Sublime/Bob Marley Medley" I regret not putting any Sublime songs on this, but I will on my next one. This is a cool medley.  18. Lamb Effect- "Homeless Man" I don't know how you can't dance to this song. 19. Adam Sandler- "Ode to my Car" Listen to the song. 20. Bob Marley and the Wailers- "Redemption Song" I love Bob Marley, and this is my favorite Wailers song. One reason I bought  Streetcore  is because Joe Strummer covers "Redemption Song" on it. 21. The Hives- "Die, All Right" I don't really like the Hives, but I  do  like anti-capitalist rants, and this is one of the finest. 22. The God Awfuls- "Disconnected Youth" Kind of boils down punk into a nutshell. A funny song, but it still rocks. 23. Bad Religion- "Walk Away" The last of no less than three BR songs on this comp. Just as "I wanna conquer the world" was a good beginning, this is a good ending.  Until tomorrow, I'm a fist-pumping anarchist blight on society.

      Our topic of discussion "came forth like a cannonball" after reading Jason's post. What exactly makes Pokemon games so addicting? They have been around for 6-7 years now, but they still grab your imagination and make you want to play even all these years later. Even though the game is repetetive, and the story isn't even that great, you still quest with your whole heart to catch em' all. And you really feel hate for your nemesis and when you beat him you find yourself standing up and cheering... That's how it is for me anyways. Now, the new Pokemon games I never bought, although I was tempted. But, why are they so great? What makes them so cooool?

      For utter lack of participation in my contest, I might've just closed the case and let you all brew on whether or not you were right for ETERNITY. However, Mattson was so incredibly far off that I can't help but reveal the truth. He missed all but ONE of them. Ouch. So, here they are, with true owners.  "If man did not have worries, he would not be man. Worries are the foundation of humanity." - All Houley.  "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it." Not me, but Confucius...  "The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule." - Einstein  "Beyond that frontier lay another. And beyond this lays yet another, and another. There will always be frontier, though it may change in appearance and temperament, for mankind to seek." - This one was me.  "Our country was founded on a distrust of government. Our founding fathers gave power to the people to keep an eye on government. So when politicians say, Trust me, they're actually being very un-American." - This is the one he got "right" though he actually guessed the thinker wrong, and the real "thinker" was David Duchovny.  "He who trusts all falls victim to men; he who trusts none falls victim to himself." All me.  "Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters." Not famous really, but Ishaac Bashevis (Polish-American writer, "The Admirer," "Alone in the Wild Forest")  Actually, making up quotes was quite difficult. I'm glad my work payed off.  After I wrote this mornings quote, my little cousin came over. He played Morrowind while I played his Pokemon Sapphire. Now I'm hooked. I need some more Pokemon. I sold my own a long time ago. I really need it. Bad. The end.

      H&C, huh? Well... if I'm interpreting this correctly, I'm really not sure. It could be. Maybe it's just cuz C is real cool, and with as much as H is with D, and D is with C, of course, they cross paths quite often. But that's about all I can say, really.  So now I need to find something intellectual, something non-political or religious, that we're all interested in, and can be talked about for more than two paragraphs...  I can't. Besides, I gotta go.  Quotation results tonite! Get your guesses in!

      Sorry about not coming to Bryce's guys. I didn't come because I had to get up early tomorrow, I wanted to try to avoid driving after dark, and I had promised Pammy yesterday that I would do something with her if she was able to.  In other blogs, gives us his two cents about our discussions. I'm too lazy to say anything else. Also, Jason, please do what Mattson commands and think of something intelligent to discuss.

      No, the reason I was pissed is because John changes around Pammy. I could care less if he'd rather hang out with Pammy than me. If I was him, I'd probably choose Pammy, because me and Chris aren't exactly genial company. If Chris embarrasses you, fine. But you probably shouldn't be going out with Pammy if you are scared of her seeing your friends. It's not like she is going to judge you by him, anyway.   Why do I care about what people listen to? This is a hard question. Basically, I believe the music we listen to reflects who we are. Music is more important to me than most people. I know this is general, but I don't want to get into the whole punk argument again so I'll just let it be, and keep my music to myself from now on.  John: to vow to be a better friend is a noble resolve. I too, will make a vow. I will be a bigger jerk to my friends. Uh, I can't explain it. I just like to be a jerk to you guys.  I gotta bring my car to the shop tomorrow.   I got my pictures developed today, and most of them turned out quite well. I probably only used about half of the pictures I took, though.  I have been hanging out with Chris and Bryce a lot lately. Chris is no surprise, because we hang out virtually every day anyway, but I haven't done anything with Bryce really forever. He is like my slacker-replacement friend who is never busy, along with the Oselands. John and Houley and Hobe are always so busy these days. You guys need to take it easy.  I hope it is nice out tomorrow, so I can go to the beach. I haven't been to the beach all summer, and I know a really nice one that no one ever goes to.   I've started a fashion revolution, and it is getting out of hand. At first I wanted some stuff that was original, and now people are ripping off my clothes left and right. I got this really awesome Joe Strummer T-shirt, and if I see anyone else wearing one like it I am going to punch them in the face.  Speaking of Strummer, I got  London Calling  in the mail the other day, and it rocks. It reminds me that music is a force of change, and hearing something that still sounds new, exciting, and dangerous after 24 years gives me a lot of hope for the future. Sometimes it feels like everything is stagnant, that nothing under the sun is new, to use a cliche. Music brings us to new places and new people. Who hasn't been changed by music? In some cases it is only slight, like connecing an emotion or memory to a certain song. In some cases, music deeply changes you, influencing you on the outside as well as the inside.    So, I guess I am the new general of the Casualties Army, seeing as Erik sold himself out for a chance at a girlfriend, and Jorge (aka Chris) has none of the skills involved in running a massive army of asshole elitests.   Me/Chris/Bryce drove around today, much like we did yesterday. Tomorrow we actually have a plan, i.e. go to the beach if it is nice or even passable out. I'll probably give everyone a ring before we go, but I doubt anyone will want to/be able to come with other than us, and maybe Dustin and Erik.  I have eaten no solid food yet today, only coffee products. Black coffee, then frozen at the DQ, then frozen again at Caribou. It felt kind of nice at first but now I feel like throwing up.  I don't really have anything to blog about today. We should talk about something, but it shouldn't be about politics or religion. To have to actually use my brain during a discussion in the summer would be the worst kind of blasphemy. No, just kidding. Houle or John or someone start it, please?   P.S: Anyone care to speculate on H+C? (no names!)

      This one's short cuz me gots to get to tennis. Just some response to y'all.  Hawkeye: the asexual loner... You got a car? Lucky, man. I can't waste time on that, tho.  Jefe: I like how you decided to collect lures "after you saw their value." I can imagine your grandma sitting there, "Now, here, Jeffrey, these were your grandfathers favorite lures. He spent his whole life collecting these. He wanted you to have them, and add to the collection with some of your own." Jeff's like, okay, I'll just dump them somewhere, jeez. "Oh, and they're probably worth maybe a few thousand dollars, besides." Jeff's like, whoa, I think I'll collect them now.  Furthermore... Theres a distinct problem with John's whole deal and whatnot. Firstly, he's split between us and Pammy. This wouldn't be too bad. However, I sense that the inidvidual causing more strife than anyone else is none other than Chris Oseland. Being retarded to socially acceptable behavior, or at least not willing to display it if he's not, John doesn't want to hang around with Chris AND Pammy at the same time. He's forced to divvy up his time between the two. And, sometimes he chooses Pammy. This is totally understandable. Pammy... or Kraus. Hmm, toughy. Then Mattson gets offended-like.  Also, I don't see why you guys get into tizzys and hernias over what kind of music people listen to. Sheesh. It's just music. Let's all settle down and stop caring about it. Oh, no, you're listening to certain music that only  I  am supposed to listen to because I'm different and better. You're padding yourself so that people think better of you because you listen to this music. I don't care for people to judge me by the freakin music I listen to, okay, so everyone just chill out and lay off.  Adios.  PS Tommorrows the deadline, I'll post later in the day, but get your guesses in on those quotes!

      Ok. So I am pulling our boat back from Small Falls and get back to Brainerd, and see, M-son, Chris and someone in the back seat of his car.  Now me and Mattson share the hate for crappy drivers, so I drive really slow down our dirt road to our houses.  I mean, my foot wasn't on the gas.  I am sure Chris and Mattson were cussing up a storm about slow drivers and so on.  I am very surprised he didn't pass me with selected fingers sticking out the windows.  On other news, I called to complain to Tim Houle today.  I was going to explain that I am Jason's friend, our road sucks and so on, and then tell him that he needs to make Jason a man,  you know, 40 lashes each night, or pull- ups while reciting the Bible.  But I only got his answering machine, and when he called back, I completly forgot about that part.  I am now sad that I am the worst Halo player.  But happy that I beat Chris the last time we played.

      Ok, first of all, how many times did you drive out to my house to pick me up, when we weren't going to do anything, and I just needed a ride somewhere? And explain why I would want to drive up to Nisswa, pick up you and Chris, drive to Brainerd, turn around drive back to Nisswa, pick up Pammy, and drive to Brainerd. About the trash: in your car, you never asked to have it taken out, and, I don't think that I ever left anything in your car. Now, how was I being an asshole to Chris? I was acting like I always do to him. Also, I don't get a "superiority complex" every time Pammy rolls around. I'm sorry if you think that, but I don't. Chris has a pretty wierd way of "calling" then. I may have thought it was funny until I saw all the pop all over my car. But I am sorry for not hanging out with you. Although, I don't lie about things except for that one time. That was because I didn't want to deal with your guys' shit at the time. I do resolve to try and be a better friend, although I don't agree with some of the things you are saying.  Now, The Empire Strikes First. I didn't buy it to get music cred or anything. The only reason I bought it was for myself. I wanted to see if I liked it or not. Is that a bad thing?

      Things are about to get weird. John, please don't hate me for this. I mean it as a friend.  "Also today, Mattson calls me and asks for a ride from Chris' house. So, I oblige and take time to go pick them up."  I took time to pick you up tons of times in the 5 months before you had your license. Often, I voluntarily picked you up.  Far be it from me to be suspicious, but maybe you had an ulterior motive here? No doubt you wanted Pammy to see your "wacky" friend Chris or something. I know you  could  have picked us up before going to see Pammy, but whatever.  "What do they do? They leave their trash all over my car."  I'm sorry for leaving a napkin your  precious  floor, because I know for sure you  always  took everything you ate and drank in my car and threw it away. To those who haven't ever rode in my car, that was sarcasm.  "Then, when I throw it out, Chris fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car."  The reason Chris "fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car" is because he was pissed at you. He had good reason to be pissed at you, because you were being an asshole to him. Actually, you are always an asshole to him. I don't know why you get a superiority complex every time Pammy rolls around, and it pisses  everyone  off, not just Chris. Besides, Chris has "fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car" before, and on me. You should just accept Chris as himself, because throwing shit is what Chris does. It is his calling or something. It was done as a joke, and I don't doubt that you would have done the same to him. I seem to remember you thinking it pretty funny when Chris "fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car."   We don't care if you go out with Pammy. In fact, we are happy for you. But you don't need to treat us like shit and act like you're better than us when you are around her. You don't need to change yourself for her, because if she won't accept you for who you are you shouldn't be with her anyway. Eventually all you will have is Pammy because you have alienated us so much. If you would rather hang out with Pammy, cool. I'm not bitter because you won't hang out with me. A lot of people won't, not just you. You shouldn't lie to us, or act like an asshole to us, though. To tell the truth, I see through your bullshit quite easily.  Your relationship with Pammy and your relationship with your friends are seperate things, and you don't need to prove anything to us or her, so please stop. I'm sure you would rather hear it from me, because Chris can't articulate it, and everyone else will just keep it to themselves until they don't want to be your friend anymore. Again, I'm just telling you because maybe you don't consciously realize it.   When we were in your car, I didn't say anything about your punkness. I don't need to. I wondered why you had  The Empire Strikes First , because you have said several times that you don't really like BR and I would guess that ESF is a type of album you don't like. The reason me and Chris were pissed is because it is not a "John" record. It doesn't sing about girls or anything like that, and raises valid questions, something you don't normally deal with in music. I wasn't questioning your punkness, I was questioning your motives in buying the album. Do you like Bad Religion, or are you trying to pad your record collection to impress people? The reason I said to shut it off is because BR is a band I listen to every day, a band I love. I will listen to it regardless of who I am with. No doubt you thought some BR would give you some music cred and make you seem like a deeper person. To quote Erik, "Music is for self-expression, not exploitation." BR is my favorite band, and to see someone carelessly use a BR record made (makes) me mad. I turned you on to a lot of the music you listen to, and it makes me sad that you threw away the ideas while keeping the music. No doubt if Mike listened to LTJ it would piss you off.  Yesterday I got three new CDs:  Bad Religion's   The Empire Strikes First , which I had been anticipating for months, the Clash's  London Calling , and  Streetcore , by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. All three are very enjoyable. I won't bore you with the details, just make you listen to the music when you're riding in my car.  Hawkeye, I would've picked the corn. We were just giving you a hard time because we had nothing to do. We are all a little burned out on Halo, but maybe we could do a small thing at Chris's house this weekend.  Jefe- I forgot to count you when I said Dustin is the worst Halo player. You are the worst.  It is going to be hard to get up for work tomorrow morning. 8:30 is freaking early for me, considering I had to get up at 11 on Tuesday and I felt horrible. Lucky, the Dairison has strong coffee.  I miss the sense of urgency I had during school. During school I had to pack as much fun as I could have in a limited space, and now I can spend a whole afternoon visiting people's houses, even though I'm not sure if they are home. It's the journey, man, not the destination.  I guess I'm not really in a blogging mood today. Maybe tomorrow I'll encounter more interesting things.

      Jesus... How I hate working. The problem is, I love money. And to get money I need to work. Seems I cracked a tail light on my car, or, someone did it for me. That is about... 60-80 dollars. Then, there are my speakers and my amp... That is about 400 bucks thrown away. Another 150 for install, yup... Also today, Mattson calls me and asks for a ride from Chris' house. So, I oblige and take time to go pick them up. What do they do? They leave their trash all over my car. Then, when I throw it out, Chris fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car. Last time Chris ever gets a ride anywhere in my car. Also, Mattson, you say that people can't judge your "punkness." So, don't turn around and judge in turn.

      Wow, Jason was the only person who commented on my poem to hit a stud in the wall.  I was hoping that someone would see the capital H on Him, denoting that Him is God.  However the whole pain down my side thing had nothing to do with Jesus.  Most of your responses were way off the charts.  What do you people think of me.  I don't have any "teenager" problems, whether it be girls or conforming to coolness. Uggg...  Anyway I'm glad to hear that you guys beat the goat.  My weekend looks free for Halo if anyone is hosting.  I got my first car.  Yep, '93 Ford Taurus.  Mint.   My drivers test is July 13th though.  Note to Mattson: I'm really sorry for not coming with you guys tonight, but seriously, what would you do in my situation.  Sweet corn or movie?   I promise I'll try and go next time.  I am definitly going to Spider-Man 2, June 30th.

      Sorry I haven't been posting much.  My summer kicked off with my grandpa dying, so I try to spend time with my grandma.  She gave me my grandpa's 1950's fishing lures, and some coins to start off my collection.  I decided to start collecting them when I saw the value of them.  M.I.A this summer.  WOW!! I dont know who to thank.  I should start with my parents, then everyone at work, with the exeptation of Rad.  I haven't worked with him much, but this summer he gives me much less crap for being a sophmore.  But the joke is on that ass wipe, he is going to be a sophmore when we are seniors.  YES!!.  Any ways, did you ever think I am M.I.A when you never call me and I dont know what you guys are doing.  I can do something Friday night, while sunday and monday I have off.  SO CALL ME.    I finally got a CD player in my car and I am pretty excited.  And I am happpy to know that Dustin is a worse Halo player than me.  I will see you guys later, maybe.

      Well, today work seemed to go slower than usual. But it was ok because I got paid an extra 20 dollars in gas money/pay reimbursment. After work we headed up to Nisswa for some pretza. Surprisingly, Chris wasn't as big of a jackass about Pammy being there as I thought. Besides the couple of "wife" comments, he didn't say much. Also, I can live with being a sellout. Sellouts for life.

      All right, I feel like I can think clearly now.  There isn't much to do around here. It is hard to find people to hang out with (even though I find someone pretty much every day). I don't think my friends share the sense of adventure I have, and just hopping in my car and driving isn't sufficent fun for them to leave their houses. Sometimes it seems that we spend more time planning things than actually doing them, and this frustrates me.  I don't know why I keep going back to Pirate's Cove, every time I go, I just get pissed and hit fives on every hole. But it isn't the actual game that keeps me coming back, is it? It's the companionship. I feel like my day has been wasted if I just sit inside and read. I also don't watch TV at all, unless it is one AM or later.  I need to have my car looked at. It makes this rattling noise when I turn, and I hope it doesn't break down. I like that car, man. It's comfortable and gets good gas mileage.  Things I need to buy:  Tsunami Bomb - "The Great Escape"  Bad Religion - "The Empire Strikes First" Full tank of Gas I think that is a reasonable amount to spend, without being broke until next paycheck like I was this week.  I'll play your quotes game (I just quickly guessed): "If man did not have worries, he would not be man. Worries are the foundation of humanity." Thinker "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it." Houleism "The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule." Ehhh, Houleism "Beyond that frontier lay another. And beyond this lays yet another, and another. There will always be frontier, though it may change in appearance and temperament, for mankind to seek." Heinlein "Our country was founded on a distrust of government. Our founding fathers gave power to the people to keep an eye on government. So when politicians say, Trust me, they're actually being very un-American." Noam Chomsky "He who trusts all falls victim to men; he who trusts none falls victim to himself." Thinker "Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters." Houleism  For tomorrow after work: Clean and wash my car, and clean my room.   Oh, right, awards. Uhh.....What do I give awards out for? Casualties Army for Life: Chris Sellouts: Erik, John Most likely to succeed: Houley Most likely to be a burned out mess, living in a van down by the river and yelling nonsense: Tay Lord of Boring: Hawkeye M.I.A. this summer: Jefe Facists: Hobe, Schilling, Tay, Bailey Favorite Summer Pastime: Jammin' Worst Halo Player: Dustin Coolest House: Bryce Claims to bring the System down from the Inside: Fish Boy ....Who is really a: Corporate Whore Most likely to kill a friend: Realistically, Chris. He's most likely to kill  anything . In his defense, it will probably be an accident. But I think it is really John who is planning to off me.  Most like myself: ??? I don't know. Probably Chris. We're different, but not fundamentally different,  radically  different, like some others, and we believe in basically the same things.  Got some nonsensical calls today. I hate when people call me, and I don't understand what they're saying or what is going on or  anything . I also hate when people call me from strange numbers without voicemail. In my missed calls list, I counted 13 numbers which I do not know. The  13 mystery callers always call in the late morning, when I am asleep. You'd think they learn.  On that subject: Chris left me  five  voice messages the other day. None of them were even about anything important or relevant.  Buttons, man. Who thought of those?  Hobe remarked today that he thought of himself as a nerd because he played Halo every couple of weeks. I guess it is a negative thing to him. Halo is kind of like a group hierarchy thing, with people asserting their awesomeness through Halo. But I am kinda sick of playing 'lo now. After kicking Goat's ass, what do I have to prove? Maybe some of my other enemies will challenge me to a Halo match. Returning to the nerd thing, why does Hobe think it is a bad thing to be a nerd? I wouldn't mind being called a nerd, even though I don't think I am one. I hate math, hate science, hate Star Trek, and hate D+D. So, I don't know. Nerds have done cool things, though. Even though I will hate Weezer forever for birthing emo with their horrible  Pinkerton , I will love them forever for their sublime  Blue .  Blue  is one of those albums you can put on, and everyone in the car loves it and no one argues about what we are going to listen to for an hour or so. I swear that the bass line from  Only in Dreams  will be burned into my head forever.  But anyway, I bet Hobe doesn't know that the quickest way to an emo girl's heart is through being a nerd. Yeah, it works better even than listening to Dash and wearing a hankerchief in your back pocket. To be fair, according to m-w.com, using a hankerchief as a clothing accesory is a valid use of it, even though you probably will be hated by everyone forever. But hey, maybe Hobe knows that. Maybe he's trying to front himself as a so-called "nerd." Maybe I've been blogging for too long.  That above paragraph gave me a bad urge to listen to  Blue , and now I am.  Yeah, before Rivers surrounded himself with Asian women and started doing blow, he knew how to  rock . I just realized no one will understand that. I stand by it, anyway.  At mini-golf today, the River Rats next to the course were covering songs I liked. Anyway, one was  Say it Ain't So . Even misguided Misfits fans like Weezer.  I woke up at two today. Every morning, I vow that I will get up in ten more minutes, and it spirals out of control for hours.   Now that the blog has had a chance to grow a little, I'm glad I started it. It can be at times both sad and poignantly funny.  Poignantly  is an ambitious adverb to use, but I'm sure that  A day in the life of...  will live up to the hype. Heck, I've learned things about people I might have never learned, especially considering that I only pay half-attention to most people.  You know what I don't like? When songs break down into 7 minute jams. I used to think it was cool, but do we really need six minutes of Brad Nowell singing, "Down here at the pawn shop"?  My short-story comp is almost finished, and I'm looking down the barrel of no less than 4 novels. I've been having problems finishing books lately, something that almost never happens to me.   Well, this is about as long-winded as it goes. See ya tomorrow night.

      Ahhh, work tomorrow.   Working 12-5 is going to really suck. It is going to ruin my day, because I still have to go to bed early to get up by noon, and by the time I get off work I won't feel like doing anything.  My house is too hot to think. It must be 95 degrees in here, and my room is probably 110. It sucks.  I went to Pirate's Cove today with Bryce, Houley, and Hobe. Due to the heat and rain, it also sucked.   I don't have much to blog about today, I just realized. Being as it was too hot to think, I didn't do much thinking.  God, Brainerd sucks. First it is too cold to do anything in the winter, and now it is ninety degrees outside.  It's too hot to listen to music, if you can believe that.  I'm going to take a cold shower, and if I am cooler then, I will continue to blog. If not, I will tomorrow.

      Today... I was expecting a call. Or my parents were. So my post's a bit late.  Not that I really have much to post about... no deep theology to make me think... I'm stuck on  Stranger in a Strange Land . It's taken some turns that I don't like, but for some reason get me hooked even more on the book.  Here's a pleasant game: I'll list a bunch of quotes. You separate the ones from real thinkers and intelligent people from me. Not saying I'm not intelligent. Let me amend myself: Famous thinkers and intellects from my own thrown in there. Feel free to comment. I'll reveal all on... Friday.  "If man did not have worries, he would not be man. Worries are the foundation of humanity."  "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it."  "The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule."  "Beyond that frontier lay another. And beyond this lays yet another, and another. There will always be frontier, though it may change in appearance and temperament, for mankind to seek."  "Our country was founded on a distrust of government. Our founding fathers gave power to the people to keep an eye on government. So when politicians say, Trust me, they're actually being very un-American."  "He who trusts all falls victim to men; he who trusts none falls victim to himself."  "Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters."  To tell the truth, Hawkeye's poem hit me with religious sense. "The pain, it's running down my side;" Jesus pierced in the side. "I'll be slain only if it pleases Him." Especially the capital H, for God. The middle didn't really click with that theory, though.  That's all for tonight. I've got some Leno to watch.

      Lately, it seems that I haven't any time for this favorite past time of mine. First it was school. Just the homework and the tests and the studying put a stop to my reading. Also, my second semester EB class didn't allow me to stay up as late and also cut into my reading time. Now, it has been the summer that has stopped the reading. There has been so much going on and just sitting around seems sooo appealing in this comfortable heat.   In the last few days, I have fought against this comfort and have picked up a book. Right now, I am in the process of reading  Salem's Lot . After that, I have the 3rd Tales of the Otori book lined up. Following is  American Gods . Afterwards, I plan on finishing the classics  Don Quixote  and  Beowulf .   When I get done with all of that, who knows what I will read. I think I will go back and re-read ASoIaF and some of my favorite Timothy Zahn books.  Today, I think I am going to tear off the trim on my front doors on my car. I really don't want to do this but I have to to see what size the speakers are. Plus, it sounds kinda fun. Maybe, I will just call Best Buy and ask the speaker people what size speaker fits...

      So Goatfest '04 went down tonight. It wasn't pretty. It wasn't clean. It was  total freaking annihilation . And by  total freaking annihilation , I mean we utterly destroyed them. We weren't even close to the peak of our games, and we unleashed a torrent of video karate so devastating they resorted to juvenile tricks and name-calling. It was rad, to say the least. It's a funny thing, because I was over at my mom's house earlier and the whole family was talking trash about how good they were. And they pretty much sucked. My teammates played like heroes and I am intensely proud of them for helping me show the Goat who the better person (people) is (are).  Afterwards me and Chris and Bryce laid back in my car, and had a good conversation about true friendship. Me and Chris are intensely pissed off at Erik for ditching fighting the Goat, his mortal enemy, for some girls that are going back to Chicago tomorrow.   What makes a good friend? Do they always tell you what is right, what you want to hear, or a combination of both? Are they there for you? Will they go and get messed up over some girl and ditch you? I don't know, man, but we ranted about Erik for probably an hour before T. Plumb started yelling at us.   Turns out my stalkers are back. Now they know my address, but I doubt they'll actually come here.  Iced tea tastes disgusting but for some reason I drink it anyway.  It seems to be a day (well, night now) of digressions, as I can't seem to concentrate on anything. I've had a headache for a while, and it is starting to make me irritable.  I need some new music. Whenever my life feels stale, new music always livens it up. When I get paid on Thursday I'm going to buy some CDs.  Got pulled over by the law tonight.  I feel like tonight was a victory. Not just because we popped the Goat's ego balloon, but because now I can move on with summer. I hate how summer is just a series of points you look forward to, and when one passes you just move on to the next and forget about the days in between. I haven't had a truly pointless day yet this summer, and I doubt I will. Whenever I am doing something, whatever it is, chances are there is a reason I am doing it. A deep, mysterious, mystical reason.   Nah. Just a normal reason.  Boy, do I get irritable if no one pays attention to me. I just realized that.   The new Bad Religion CD hits the streets on Tuesday, which is about important to me as getting laid by the Chicago girls is to Erik.  You know who sucks? UPS. I ordered my stuff on Wednesday, and it still hasn't came.  Back to the stalkers: Hannah and Kali really bother me. I hate how Hannah calls me bitter, how Kali talks to me like a little kid, how conservative Hannah is, how Kali has to always ask me what I'm doing tonight, how Hannah secretly tapes me and makes projects out of it, how Kali never leaves me alone, how they seem to ambush me whenever they see me, etc. I could go on all night, probably. Oh yeah, and they're music snobs. Kali lives next to Houley, and I had to drop a map off at Houley's today. Anyway, she had her Graduation party today, and I had to do this sneaky Mission:Impossible shit to get around her house without being seen, lest I be sucked into that menagerie of indie music and uncomfortable, personal, probing questions. God, I hope they don't come to my house.  I need to find someone to hang out with tomorrow. If you want to hang out with me, post or call or something. My phone will be on quiet until I wake up, around one or two.  This blog always seems strangely impersonal to me. I'm glad people are starting to come around that your thoughts can be posted here safely. It's like some wacky "safety zone" or something. What happens here, stays here. Unless it is someone else, in which case I will spread it everywhere I go.  I can rant like no other. I've been ranting about Erik and John for probably the past week, but I am getting sick of that and will move on to something else. I usually interrupt my conversations with some comments about what I'm pissed off at at that moment.  Seriously though, I'm pissed at Erik.  After my blog I either read or watch Adult Swim. I'm reading a really rad collection of short stories right now, but I'll probably watch Adult Swim allowing that it is Sunday night and Mission Hill is on at 2:30 (Yes!).  I'm a really bad night owl. I usually don't fall asleep until three or four in the morning. The reason is because I spend a lot of time in bed thinking. During the school year I usually repress my thoughts after a good hour of thinking but during the summer I let my train of thought run for as long as it pleases. Just laying there thinking is very relaxing, and it is easier to sort my thoughts out and plan for the next day. A lot of things I think about in bed are posted here later on.  I'd like to bring more people into the blogger fold but I can't think of anyone who'd want to. Maybe Bryce. I like talking to Bryce because he has a lot of interesting insights, and when you've heard the same old story from your other friends he'll say what everyone is thinking.     It has only been summer for a while but I already feel relaxed. Good for me.  Maybe I'll post in the day tomorrow. I always say I will, but I'd rather do something in the daytime.  Until tomorrow.

      Also, I don't think Hawkeye's poem was about a girl. In fact, I don't even understand how you guys got that interpretation out of it. Personally, I think if it really was written to describe how he really feels, that would be kind of weird. When I read it, I seem to think more of the pressures of society of doing things that are "cool." At the end though, it stops to make any sense at all to me.  Also, as Mattson said, Ronald died. One less ex-president to populate the earth. Everyone can celebrate.   Dear Mr. Houle, We here at the Dairison, as it is called, think that you should come work with us. Leave Culver's behind and come join us. Not only is the working enviroment much better, but you will get paid much more. The end.

         Yeah, Ronald Reagan died today.   "Recession is when your neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose yours, and recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his."  Reagan said this during his first Presidential campaign. Of course, he sunk the economy even lower during his quest to conquer the Soviets, but hey, he  did  bring the Ruskies to their knees, didn't he? I guess I shouldn't be taking shots at the Gipper now that he is dead instead of merely senile.   Rest in Peace, Ronnie.  Some new things on the blog today: You can now put links on the sidebar. E-mail me the links you would like under your name or just post them here. I'm fiddling with the template and I think I might switch the template again. Oh, and you can have titles now.  Today was a boring waste of time. In short, a perfect summer day. John bailed on me and Chris when we went to go mini-golfing, so we didn't go. I must've called 30 people to try and get someone to go with us, but nobody was home. Erik is a mess because some of Gail's friends are visiting, with daughters, and Erik's "hormones are ragin'," to quote Gail. He's being a bigger asshole than normal, if that is even possible. We went swimming in South Long last night and this morning and it was freaking  cold .  Tomorrow is going to be busy, what with the Goat match and all. It is going to be a pain to get everyone together, but if everyone babysits one other person of the irresponsible half of our team, it should be cool. I've got pledges from John, Houley, the Oselands, and Bryce that they will be there. Hobe will come too, and I hope David also. The Oselands have this super-weapon they call Kramer who is really good at Halo and said he would come too. But I would rather take people who are fighting for honor rather than personal glory. We should meet somewhere tomorrow a few hours before the Goat match.  I hope my UPS stuff comes tomorrow.   Like I said earlier, if you can find people that wish to join, then by all means, do so. Some diversity would be cool.   I agree with Houley. Even though I don't think that the poem is about a girl, I bet that is why Hawkeye is so down all the time. (You know what that poem reminded me of? Wheel of Time.) The Man is always sticking it to him. I bet he has a bad case of the emos because Sarah E. doesn't like him or something like that.   Kids worry about their relationships with the opposite sex too much. It is supposed to be something natural, not something you force. So don't worry about it, man. And if you think we are making fun of you or something, just let me quote some U.S. Bombs:  "All my friends, they get their kicks stomping on my dreams."  When we're done stomping, you'll feel better.   I don't particularly enjoy Sci-Fi, but I've still read some good Sci-Fi and tons of garbage.  Ender's Game  is a great read. Off the subject of sci-fi, a few good books off the top of my head that you should read are the  Dark Towers, Cat's Cradle, American Gods, Catch-22, and Catcher in the Rye  can be read in a couple hours if you have the time and is quite good. I'll bring  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  to Goatfest.  I really hate it when I try to get a hold of Hobe and he doesn't answer his home phone or bring his cell phone with him. He  never  has his cell phone.  I'm  supposed to be the unreliable one, damnit, and it really annoys me.  I'll hand out some awards, too. But mine will be longer. I'll probably post how Goatfest goes tomorrow night, and maybe I will then.   I feel about done for tonight.  Uh, I'm not really ready to quit, though.  John, you annoy the hell out of me. Even worse than Chris, you give me a headache. Quit ditching us at the last second because all of us really hate it.  I doubt I'll sleep for another four hours (It's 11:20 now) and I wish someone would post later than me. Anyway, Gute Nacht.

      I'd agree that all's been said that can be said about punk and self-image. Also, we reached a good agreement as to what we really meant, which ended up being about the same thing. This post's gonna flow. Like a flow chart.  Firstly, Mattson didn't put up the thinker like he said he would. I need some thinking. It helps clear my sinuses. Also, that football variation was awesome.  I'm pumped for the Goat match on Sunday. We oughta strategerize, but I'm fairly confident that 8 guys flowing up the field can take about anything. A few defensive snipers and we'll be good. Also, as far as a slayer match would go, we'd have to go 5 on 5 to not afford them oodles of slaughters, and I volunteer myself and the Oselands to sit those ones out, being, as we are, the 3 worst players, esp. as far as just kills go.   Somehow, someway, Matt Houle thinks we may get an Xbox. Like the special Halo edition one or something like that. Furthermore, Hawkeye is feeling his need for Halo. It would be awesome if he were to join our parties as oft as possible.  On the topic of Hawkeye... who is she? I think I sensed some serious longing and fear in that poem. There's gotta be a girl behind it somewhere. It's a secret that's tearing this man apart.  So whether or not that was true or just a good segue to this point: one easy way to spice this place up, not to mention add diversity, would be to throw some estrogen factors in here, if you know what I mean. And I don't know how you couldn't... Really, though, if any female could stand us, it would certainly be interesting.   That's about as far as it flows. I picked up three awesome sheet music books from Bridge of Harmony, music from the 60's, 70's, and an Elvis collection. There's a bunch of Elton and Billy and whatnot, including Piano Man.   As of May 31st, my employment with Culver's of Baxter reached one year. Today I actually trained another guy in to Fryers position. I've also started working Buns and may start on grill. I've moved back to the kitchen, which beats about any front position ten times over.  I'm totally hooked on Stranger in a Strange Land. There were 5 Heinlein books on the readers' selections on Hobe's brother's list, but 0 on the boards'. I've already read 1 1/2, and have another on hold. After I've spent about all of Mr. Science Fiction, as I guess he's called, I plan to move onto Slaughterhouse Five and maybe some Hemingway if I can stomach it. I gotta fit One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in there somewhere also.    "Kissing girls is a goodness. It is a growing-closer. It beats the hell out of card games." - Valentine Michael Smith

      First of all, I don't think any of you who commented on my poem REALLY read it.  Well, maybe Houle, but he said his post was too long and didn't comment.  I don't have any angst at all, and if you looked at the poem you would see that; instead of just saying "creepy."  There's a story behind it, all you have to do is look at it.  So here it is again:  PAIN  I feel it, the pain, it's running down my side. The blackness, the bane coming forth to consume me. Little voices in my head are driving me insane, always urging me: "do it, do it." Like little drops of rancid rain they fill me up inside. I swirl and swell without a drain, my seams will surely break. It is only I who know it though, it's entirely my strain; My outsides show no signs of grief. Therin lies the problem, I'm not a child plain. Why should someone help me, a child with a brain? Will I float or will I sink, when my sorrows fill the brim? When the vein pops I'll be slain only if it pleases Him.  I've decided to give out some awards.  Most like myself: Josh H. or John V. Most Spontaneous: Josh M. Coolest kid on the block: Bryce O. Slowest kid around: Jeff S. Most likely to kill a friend because of constant harassment about Pammy: John V.  The final note: I need to find a way to play Halo, or at least a way to get training for it.  Next weekend looks open for me so...

      First of all, Bird Boy, that was creepy and didn't make any sense. Let me write a poem of my own to complement it.  Here in my hand I hold a pen What should I do? Should I set it down And find another Ten? Or should I hold it and say "One in your hand Is better than 10 in the pit."  Because that is what a drawer is A deep, dark pit That dominates everything Around itself and then some Like a Korean in a Blizzard Game. Never has one Of the Asian Race ever Been called a Noobie For they have forever been Invincible. Every Asian has The innate ability to be Gosu. In the language Of us, that is Godly.   Once more, the pen. It is black and Sharp, A Sharpie to be exact. With this pen, I could Conquer the World, or at least, Give it to those who would. For a pen has always been mightier Than any kind of weapon. With this, countries can me made and wrought from naught.  That poem rocks. Anyways... Go me! Most improved JV doubles.

      Eh, I'll just start on Houley's post. I really don't have the energy to debate it all, plus you have made some strong points that I can't refute (the actions of the majority of people, how society discerns you, etc).  In point 2, by "we" I mean people as a whole. The "I" part was meant as an example. I probably shouldn't have used myself as an example of the majority of the people. I'll concede that you are right in your points about seeking acceptance.  So, we differ on how we are defined: through society and through ourselves. Let's say that we are defined two ways: our "true" selves, what is inside us and how we see ourselves; and how society judges us. As one changes, so does the other. I agree that how society sees us can affect our "true" selves, and vice versa. That is a good compromise of our ideas and probably the closest thing to the truth anyway.  Anyway, to kind of take Houley's points and run off on a tangent:  Why can't we be judged as individuals rather than as social cliques? Do people see our group of  friends as another clique or a group of individuals? It is hard to tag a name on us since we are all so different. It is probably more friendship than common interests that hold us together. I try not to judge people as groups, but it is hard. You can't always see every person as an individual. Everyone has their prejudices, be it against psuedopunks or emo kids or gays or liberals or whatever. Sometimes I want to shout that I am a human being, dammit, and you have no right to judge me by association. But I think that most people feel comforted when they fit inside a niche in society. The  truly  messed up ones are the people that don't fit anywhere. But they aren't messed up, are they? They just don't belong. I guess every kid feels disconnected from society at one point, and I think that is normal. I dont hold grandiose ideas that I am a big rebel or anything, I just believe what I believe. I'm not sure how much farther we can dissect punk and society so maybe we should just let it be unless someone else wants to comment on it.   When I said "brainwash," I was just exaggerating because I was mad. I know conservativism is just as valid as liberalism. I was just shocked that these supposedly mature kids would do that to my car. However, parents pass on to their children the bad as well as the good. I don't think that parents are the architects of who we are. I was raised in a conservative religious family, especially on my mom's side. She used to force me to go to church even though I told her I didn't want to go. She never allowed me to grow because she tried to override my ideas with hers. I became extremely resentful then and perhaps irreplacebly damaged my relationship with her. Simply put, we don't agree. My parents didn't teach me right and wrong. I decided what was right and wrong to me. So my parents  (one of the most rock-solid and sturdy social groups with which any person interacts throughout their life)  perhaps think that I am a failure in their eyes. Well, my mom failed me by teaching me that her truth was the absolute truth. It is not (and neither is mine). I don't know if this brings us back to the punk argument or what.   Never let your parents learn that they don't have as much influence on you as they think.  In the majority of cases, parents are a good influence on their kids. In some cases, parents damage their kids lives by trying to make them carbon copies of themselves. (Some juniors would be an example, by picking up their parents prejudices) Another example are the Goat kids. They are exactly like their dad and live to please him. They will pick up his bad attributes as well as his good, and never grow as people.  On God: I don't know, man. No one is changing anyone's mind about God here. Let me just reiterate that I believe in free will. To me, God is the feeling you get from doing right, the reward of a life justly lived. There are different degrees of just to different people. To me, God isn't a literal thing as much as an idea.  "What about free will? Do we have a choice?" -Brett Gurewitz  A bunch of people seemed to congregate at the Hobster's house today, and we played some Halo, a fun variation of football with a volleyball, and me and Bryce went swimming. It was kind of cold but it refreshed me. Tomorrow we are going to Harry Potter and practicing for Goat Fest in the afternoon at Casa de Olshanski.   Having enough of my own problems, I'm not really qualified to examine your life, Hawkeye. But I will, because I like to meddle. You seem to suffer from a lot of teen angst. Just remember that things get better. Get out of your house more and stop brooding on it. Have some fun. Everyone gets a case of the emos once in a while, but you'll get over it. Creepy poem though.  Some general things:  One of the best parts of my day is when I wake up in the morning and remember that it is  summer . At the rate of fun that I am having now, this should be one of the most fun summers ever.  We should bring more people in the blog as Jefe seems to have died and Hobe is too busy with his whirlwind social schedule to post here. Does anyone have any suggestions for who? Some diversity would be nice. I had half a mind to ask Chris Derby but I think that he wants to do his own thing. But a John/Chris deathmatch would be cool.  Could the Casualties write a song so bad that not even they could rock out to it?  I'll have to avoid the Oseland's house for a couple days because Gail has visitors who are a bunch of jerks. It will be weird to not go there for a few days.  It is both cool and depressing not seeing everyone every day. I wouldn't say that I miss school though.  Hobe, are you going to any grad parties? I was supposed to go to a few but I don't want to go by myself. I was also supposed to go to Jamie's party but I don't want to risk running into Proctor and having to talk to him.  I think I'm done for tonight.

      That’s kinda creepy, Hawkeye. However, this post is long enough, so I’ll get back to it later. And Johnny, the idea is so horridly impractical it makes me shudder. How about your basement? Except maybe move it closer, say about the Westgate Mall, so we’re not using half a tank to get there.  I also want to hear what the Hobster has to say. Or really, anyone. It’s basically me and Mattson who post here, John occasionally rants about something or other…  BTW, I received Hardest Worker (Varsity) and Most Improved Singles (Varsity) at the tennis banquet. Y’all should’ve come, ‘specially Johnny, since he lettered and won Most Improved Doubles (JV). Hobster had to take all his stuff… he also lettered and won Most Improved Doubles (Varsity).  I’ll read that book, sounds like a good read. I hope to get into some good, deep stuff this summer. I stayed up half the night last night reading Stranger in a Strange Land, very good. Maybe reading classics like this will help me find myself. If nothing else, it gives me a boost for Knowledge Bowl, which, by the way, you should join, Mattson and John. I’m gonna work hard and play hard, especially when it comes to Halo. I read the Halo 2 preview in Holby’s magazine and I almost died of awesomeness poisoning. Destructible environments and vehicles, double wielding, new weapons, hijacking vehicles… I’ma explode.  However, I must strongly disagree with you on some points. Being punk yourself, you feel that society is NOT the ultimate judge of a person. This viewpoint IS the very essence of being punk – the sheer individualism of free will. However, the only time which it is not are cases of complete isolation from society or living in a drastically dynamic social environment in which individuals play little role in relation to the whole; you don’t have a certain group of people that judge you, its just strangers on the street. Otherwise, the group of individuals, whether 4 close friends or all of BHS, that associate themselves with you regularly, makeup the social unit that is the actual judge of you, socially. Truly, only YOU know exactly yourself. You may be completely different inside than you are on the outside. But, if this outside is all society sees, it is all they can judge you by. A strong reinforcement here comes from our continuation to call Jarid a poser. He may be a poser, he may not. I feel he’s a better skateboarder than many, since he’s worked at it and likes to do it. Still, the label sticks, at least among us. Regardless of Jarid’s self-image, hardly even “deceiving himself” anymore since he has significant skill, he cannot do anything to change our perception of him. He is, and will remain, a poser, at least to us, until he does something to change our views otherwise. To clear up what I meant, when I said “what you ARE” I meant what your social distinction is, whether prep, jock, pseudopunk, slut, whatever. Your social distinction is solely classified by what society defines you as; that is basically its definition. Being, as you are, “punk,” your feelings that society doesn’t control you are completely in line. Your rejection of society’s hold on you and ability to control your social status makes you punk. In your comments on my second point, you shift speakers a few times, going from ‘you’ to ‘we’ and finally to ‘I.’ Not to be offensive, but my comments really didn’t concern you. They were mainly directed at pseudopunks. You say, “Why compromise your values and beliefs to get invited to a few more social functions?” I don’t, or try not to. But many people, VERY many people do. “We don't seek acceptance from societies or groups, though. We seek acceptance through individuals.” Maybe you do. But not necessarily everyone. Politicians do not seek acceptance by individuals – it is much more efficient to project their message to societies and groups. They can’t do exactly what any one person wants, so they appease the group in their best manner. Finally, “I could care less what the vast majority of people think of me, but there are people that I listen to and care about.” That’s you. That’s not everyone else, the vast majority that you speak of who does want acceptance from the vast majority.   At the top, you speak of how parents “brainwash” their children. This is definitely wrong. Parents provide the sole education for a child preceding formal schooling. It is the job of a parent to teach their children what is right, and, therefore, project their own ideas of what is right onto their child. They only do what they think is right. Their children, being malleable as little children, follow and listen and learn, and, pleasing their parents (one of the most rock-solid and sturdy social groups with which any person interacts throughout their life), they gain acceptance. However, their scraping of stickers was awfully immature. Though retaliation would just lower you to their level, it may be the only thing that gets though to them, like spanking a young child. By all means, bring back the rod! I haven’t seen Starship Troopers, the movie, but I read the book. It’s decent, but it’s heavily sci-fi, and while it makes a presumption of being intellectual, it truly can’t get past the sci-fi aspects, not to mention a horrible and flat ending that really kills it with little resolution. In case you’re wondering, it involves corporal punishment, and I heartily agreed with some points it brought up, regardless of how fultily unrealistic they are.  Am I punk. I don’t know. I don’t know what society thinks of me. Well, yes, I know I’m smart and nice, a huge nerd most likely, possibly preppy, with a good sense of humor, and a strong Catholic faith. That’s just what I’ve gathered. But it would be something to know what everyone really thinks of me. Analogy: I feel I’m a fairly good tennis player. I watch other players play, often ones that I have beaten. I watch them play, and say “If I’m better than this player, who I see as playing quite well, I must be pretty good myself.” Then something comes up like the All-Sports Banquet video, and I see myself playing tennis. I don’t look good at all. I spot loads of things about myself that need changing. Basically what I’m trying to say is, taking a new perspective on yourself provides a lot of deep insight into what society thinks of you, and how it matches up to your self-image, for better or for worse. All I know is that punk, to me, carries many negative connotations. I have a picture I got off the internet that I use in my “We Didn’t Start the Fire” video, the one I display as Mr. Joel sings “punk rock.” I’ll try and describe it in less than a thousand words: Theres the MTV logo and stuff in the bottom left. On the right, this guy wears a raggedly black hooded sweatshirt with Oriental-style writing, offering the camera a piece of cheese pizza while dementedly sticking out his tongue to show how the piercing there complements the ones in his nose and lip. On the left, this girl with a tall black mohawk smiles over at him, wearing a studded black leather jacket over a shirt with a green oval and words in it that I can’t make out. Behind her is another girl, wearing a big Cheshire cat grin while she holds a cut-out of an astronaut upside down. She wears a collar and black-and-red striped socks, and has nose piercings and obvious tatooes. That whole thing just creeped me out.   Finally, as your eyes must be hurting by now, one last comment, going on about predestination vs. free will. It’s again, all in the perspective. From God’s point-of-view, everything is predestined – He knows, before we are born, whether we are going to heaven or hell. Impossible, you say. Well, God created time, so it’s obviously no boundary to Him. But from our POV, the only one that really matters, since nobody here is God, we have free will, the ability to change our environment. God knows what we will do. It’s sort of hard to grasp. Even if we try to not do what we think He knows we will do, we are still doing what He knows we will do. Sort that out, if you can. It is as a result of this free will that some people do go to Hell. Why would God create us with free will if it meant some would go to Hell? Why would he put us in this world of pain and horrible temptation if there was a chance he would lose us? Well, as Mattson puts it, pressure makes diamonds. God wants us to love and to be loved, and love cannot exist without free will. I’ll stop before I get into any sort of trouble.

      First of all I'm not going to start in on all of this "punk" business because just about everything has been said by Josh and Jason.  After leaving Mr. Wanningers class I realized that I haven't really created anything with the knowledge that I obtained in that class, so I wrote a poem.  I tried to go as deep within myself as I could and this is what I came up with.  (feel free to analyze my poem in your blog)           PAIN  I feel it, the pain, it's running down my side. The blackness, the bane coming forth to consume me. Little voices in my head are driving me insane, always urging me: "do it, do it." Like little drops of rancid rain they fill me up inside. I swirl and swell without a drain, my seams will surely break. It is only I who know it though, it's entirely my strain; My outsides show no signs of grief. Therin lies the problem, I'm not a child plain. Why should someone help me, a child with a brain? Will I float or will I sink, when my sorrows fill the brim? When the vein pops I'll be slain only if it pleases Him.  That's all for today, ponder long and hard.

      After much thought, I have realized something. We need a "clubhouse" of sorts. A place where we can congregate and come up with plans. There are several key things to a place that make it a "clubhouse" quality location: tt has to be centrally located, it can't be too big, but it has to be big enough, it has to have a couch and a phone, it needs a swing, and most importantly, it needs to be empty except for us most of the time.

      The lights are dimmed, my headphones are on (Sublime tonight, for a change), and I got my juice box out of the fridge, so it must mean that it is time for me to blog.  First things first:  To the asshole junior(s) who scraped my stickers off my car: I'm sorry that my beliefs don't conform with what your parents brainwashed you with. Nevertheless, my car is my property and I can express whatever I want on it. It is classless and juvenile for you to stoop to vandalizing my car rather than telling me that you don't agree with me. When I find out which of you did it, I'm going to plaster your car with John Kerry stickers. I've got a bunch of them coming in the mail.  The warcraft analogy in the post below made me laugh pretty hard.  Time for a brief interlude in my blog to comment on Houley's post. I'm sorry if I come across as a jerk below, but I'm going to take a page out of Mr. Wanninger's book and remove the "I think" part of the sentence. So, lets go:  I'll split my thoughts up so they don't become too convolted.  First off, lets say we can split punk into two parts: beliefs and actions. I'll split beliefs into politics and philosophy, to be brief. I realize that politics is a part of philosophy but it since most punks have very similar politics I will split it from philosophy. Philosophy is what I talked about in an earlier post and will talk about later in this post. Politics are what punk rock springs from. Punk rock is usually associated with a leftist working class movement, and that is not totally true but is close enough for the sake of this argument. Most punks like punk rock and vice versa. For most, punk rock is the road into punk. This ties into psuedopunks and politics, which I will reference later on. But anyway, actions can also be split into two things: internal actions and social actions. Social actions are things like wearing certain clothes, saying certain things, or hanging out with certain people. Internal actions are things that happen inside you.  It could be a belief, an idea, or just a thought. Internal actions are much more common in punks than in social actions because some people are shy or just don't care to dress or act different.  A good example of a internal action would be this: One day Hawkeye and I were walking down the hall, and he wondered out loud if we weren't just cattle being herded through pens. This was a very punk thought, because it challenged the idea that school is beneficial to us.   So now punk has been split into four parts: politics, philosophy, social actions, and internal actions. Going by these we could say that qualities a punk might have is that they are leftist, like punk rock, believe in free will and individualism, refuse to accept social norms, dress, act, and think different than other people. But this is not exactly right, because most punks are a combination of only a few of them. For instance, a psuedopunk might have only the social and political qualities of a punk. They don't realize or practice what is at the core of punk and therefore   are not punk. Some people only practice internal actions and are punk. Some people are wacky individualists and are punk. You can't fit punk into only one of these categories. There are all sorts of different punks. But you are not a punk just because you think you reject society, to use Houley's all-encompassing word. You have to understand society in order to change it.  In conclusion: you can't just hate George Bush and wear some clothes you bought at Hot Topic to be punk. Also, there are many different kinds of punk and I am starting to realize that it takes a lot of work and explanation to define the word "punk."  To continue on, with my feelings on Houley's comments (again, with the polite "I think" removed):  1. Society is not the ultimate judge of you.  YOU  are. This is one of the things that is at the heart of punk. That you can decide what is right for you (please don't take this literally, as in a doctor or a dentist) is a central tenet of punk. The whole psuedopunk thing might seem like a contradiction to you, but they  do  look to society to judge them and determine their worth. Thus, they aren't punks. But I digress. Saying society decides who we are is basically saying we have no free will. I truly hate the idea that is isn't myself who decides who I am and where I am going. To bring a taboo subject into this argument, I've always felt that  atheism  is free will. The idea that no God, no greater power guides us to do what we do. But I don't really want to start a religion discussion, at least not until this is over. Anyway, I have the right to choose what I am and what I will be, not society. You should read  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest , because it is about social perceptions and is quite good.  2. I agree that everyone wants to be accepted (except G.G. Allin, who lived to be hated). I'm pretty sure that the need to be accepted is one of man's base needs, according to Freud. I can't remember because I haven't heard anything about psychology in a while. But I also believe that the need to be accepted only goes to a certain extent. Why compromise your values and beliefs to get invited to a few more social functions?  A lot of the time, the purpose of human interaction is to seek acceptance. We don't seek acceptance from societies or groups, though. We seek acceptance through  individuals . I could care less what the vast majority of people think of me, but there are people that I listen to and care about. I disagree with your 'rejection' idea. I follow almost all aspects of society, and the only ones I reject are the ones I want to change. I don't reject them to gain attention or seem more 'punk.'  3. I've covered most of three in my point two, but I will say a couple things. I know we all need to be accepted. I'm sure for you if the whole tennis team hated you it would hurt. It would hurt me if the people I whose judgements I trust called me a psuedopunk. It would hurt if the Oselands called me a poser. We are all human, and no one is a perfect punk or conformist or whatever. Back to rejection: I don't 'reject' society to be punk. I reject it becuase I am a punk and it conflicts with what I believe. I do what I do because it is who I am and I enjoy doing it.  4. Ask any punk what they think of psuedopunks and you will get the same answer. We are punks, but we also love punk rock and to see them piss all over our way of life by buying their clothes from Hot Topic and pretending they are rebelling and by proclaiming their love for ideas we would  die  for really pisses us off. I kind of covered this earlier.  The words "punk" and "change" and "doing the right thing" are interchangeable.  Are you a punk? I'm not going to tell you. You tell me.  I dislike most of the juniors I know because a lot of them are pretentious assholes. I know many of them well, be it through TV Pro or Halo or whatever. Like I said earlier, some of them are cool, like Tom and David. I don't hate any of the kids we play Halo with, though I dislike some of them.  I was talking more of all the juniors together. I will admit to being prejudiced against most of the people with power, be it social or political or whatever. I won't say I dislike people just because they are rich, though. A lot of my friends are well-off, including Chris and Erik, two of the punkest richest bastards I know.   Blew my paycheck already. For all the Clash talk about the evils of capitalism, they sure are costing me a lot of money.  I'm thinking about a Halo practice tomorrow. If you guys read this, call me tomorrow, and I'll take a headcount of how many of us are available. I think we are going to mulch the Goat on Sunday night. I can't remember where my Uncle Ed lives, but I know it is on a lake somewhere.  Moved some trees today.  I started playing Worms again and it has once again developed into a full-out addiction.   Where is the Hobster at? He started the whole punk argument (well, I guess it is more of a discussion) by calling me a "psuedopunk." I would love to hear what his definition of punk is.  Hobe, if you read this, type "raow."  Nothing is going on tomorrow except me putting together the Goat practice, so maybe I'll write a thought post that will spark an argument in the day and then do my usual late-night update.  Raow.

      Personally, I don't care if someone is punk or not. They can be whatever they want. Also, nobody starts out punk. They become punk over a period of time. As with everything in real life, this situation can be related to warcraft. So, people make games that say 'No Noobs,' but wasn't everyone a noob at one point and if they were and everyone made 'noobie free' games, how would anyone become anything but a noobie.  In order to find the Goat match, follow the "Baaaaahhhssss" of pain coming from the dying Goats.

      Punk. I've a bit to say about this. I'm able to tie in loads of recent posts...  Firstly - people only ARE what society thinks of them. This is reinforced time and time again by Mattson, ranting about how people who wear 'punk' stuff and listen to 'punk' music are not actually PUNK in the literal sense of the word. One cannot simply  become   whatever they want just because they feel like it... they ARE, in actuality, a summation of whatever they HAVE BEEN. Working at becoming punk will turn someone punk. But just ACTING punk doesn't cut it.  Of course, self-image and whatnot play in. But, for real, self-image can be lied to. If they seriously want to, people can deceive themselves. But they cannot fool the makeup of society, the REAL judge. Furthermore, society has the ultimate power in deciding what a person is, much more power than the person himself. The only way self-image becomes more real than society's image of a person is when they are cut off from the latter, which in fact brings up existentialism and whatnot, and that is truly irrelevant to this conversation.  Secondly - people want to be liked. John wants to be liked. I want to be liked. Everyone wants to love and be loved, its just human nature. It's pretty obvious. Therefore, using point one, one wants to present themselves to society in a way such that they are accepted, regardless of self-image. One will shift self-image to fit in, though truly, people want to think of themselves as being individual. One needn't be an indivdual if they can fit the rest of the group. But to think they are their own person, they want to fit in with a group that meshes most with their own individual self-iamge. This allows them not only individualism, or at least a deception thereof, as well as acceptance of the group.  Thirdly - punk isn't complete social rejection. Even punks want to be accepted, even if they are disillusioned with mass society. Their acceptance into society comes from the rejection of society - they WANT to be 'rejected.' In being rejected, they have acheived their 'accepatnce.' They have held their stark individualism and spurned society, which is their individual sense of acceptance, by means of their disillusionment. I hope you get what I'm saying.  Fourthly - 'Pseudopunks' are, in fact, a type of people. They might try to be punk, but, in reality, fail to lie to themselves. More so slackers and rejects, they find others like themselves and want to be accepted to this group. Maybe trying to be 'punk,' but more so trying to fit in. They might not know what 'punk' is, at least, in Mattson's sense of the word. They are NOT individualists. They just dress weird and listen to music because this is their method of accpetance into their group. Furthermore, they get the deception of being actually punk from being socially rejected by mass society, not necessarily their own group. They gain acceptance from the group and retain self-image of individualism by being rejected otherwise. Don't blame these guys more than anyone else - they're just doing their own thing as much as the rest of society.  Myself. Am I punk? I play piano. I go to church. I conform to mostly whatever. So... I'm in tune with adult society. As a teenager, however, I'm totally off the scale. So am I punk? In my own society of teenagers, I'm fairly rejected. So am I punk because I wear my pants around my hips instead of my knees? Or am I just exceptionally mature for my age... ahead of my time?  Furthermore, I do like a bunch of those juniors we play Halo with. As previously stated, everyone craves acceptance, myself in this category more than most of you. It's awfully awkward being the only sophomore in my pre-calculus class of juniors. I know a bunch of those guys in there though, from Halo. It's my wedge that I can work on to gain social acceptance from these people, and thereby make Calc next year that much more enjoyable.  Going on, Mattson has judged many of the class of 2005 quite harshly for hardly knowing them, but that's just him. I'm naturally accepting and trusting of people I don't know - I have prejudices like everyone else, but probably not the utter distrust of nonacquainences that Mattson displays. Beyond this, the class of 2005 comes from infamously affluent families - everyone will admit to it. This places them in a greater seat of social power, money being their means to this. This further spurns Mattson the punk from them, simply because of their social status, prejudging them for their luck of birth. Truly, there are a lot of unsavory juniors, or now seniors, I guess, but the entire class is definately not bad, and tit for tat, is probably better than the retarded class of 2006.  That's all I've to say. And I'm off work at 7 sunday, I might be a bit late, but I'll be there. I'll need directions.

      It depends. I've always been good at typing out what I mean to type. It doesn't really take that long unless I'm doing something else at the same time.  I had to work the last three days. That is about all that is going on.   I saw Van Helsing tonight, and it was alright. I didn't have any expectations or anything that it would be good, so mediocrity satisfied me. But 7 bucks for a movie ticket is just robbery, and I said as much to the ticket lady.  "If you don't like it, move to Russia."  I'm really tired now, but I'll write something interesting and engaging tomorrow night. I'll spend all day thinking about it.  Until then.

      What? People love John. They love me because I'm not normal. I'm Johnny V. Thats right Shane. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Anyways, working was fun because it wasn't really work, it was more of a slow, slow wait for customers. Also, it was more fun because the employees were much better. I will make a chart:  Last year employees: Nick - The devil who made a 2 pound cone Other Josh - Retarded hippy Matt - Drugged up hippy who liked Nick Andy - Crazy know-it-all wanna-be dentist with three jobs Stephany - Crazy stalker lady Amanda - One of the few employees who isn't retarded Lewis - Master work dodger Nancy - Grandma Josh - Lazy box cutter John - Me  This year: Stephany - Still crazy, now stalks Eric Eric - Cool manager type person who makes me food Jim - Another pretty cool guy Janelle - Old lady who thinks we are incompetent Lori - Crazy lady who thinks she can boss people around Amanda - Still not retarded Nancy - M.I.A. Sandy - Crazy gun-toting boss who has to do all of Mattson's work Lewis - Lord of the Universe of work dodging Josh - Still can't make cones  As can be seen from that chart, this year is much better. With the exception of Janelle and Lori, the employees are all very competent with the exception of Mattson. There are a few other employees of course, but they really don't bother me because I never have to see them.

      Is that standup electric bass in Tiger Army rad or what? Seriously, I'll be listening to this all night. Tiger Army has such a distinctive sound, and Nick 13 has an instantly recognizable voice. I don't know why, but the mellow psychobilly fits perfectly with this summer.   Psychobilly: what a weird word.  Today I had to work, which was extremely boring, especially considering my mother + grandma were gone, and I wasn't working with either John or Bryce. Basically, I listened to my iPod and listened to Lewis tell long-winded, self-indulgent stories. Anyway, that was better than actually working so I just nodded my head and kept starring cheese.  Sadly, Chris has to work tomorrow night, so we won't be doing anything. Also, Bryce is going camping so I won't have anywhere to stay. I guess we could go to a movie or something, John?  Not much in the news today, beyond the usual mundane DNC speech recaps and Michael Moore. Now, I am a liberal, just like Mike, but this guy is an  attention whore . He says he will be filming in Florida on Election Day to make sure every eligible Floridian gets their chance to vote. I imagine Mike views himself as some sort of liberal superhero juggernaut, and when he comes to town the right shakes and looks for places to hide their dirty laundry. I doubt a few cameras will stop Katherine Harris if she wishes to hand Florida over to George like in 2000. There was  plenty  of coverage of it in 2000, but everyone was unaware of W's power to really  fuck things up , so they decided hey, its only an election. Another will come around in four years, and by then the Reagan Revolution will have gained so much steam that it will have crushed the communist atheist liberal baby-killers.  Well, that wandered a little off course. So just let me say that I support Mike's efforts to mobilize the left (and moderates, and right, and anyone that will listen to him), but he could go about it in a more legitimate way. I am pretty liberal, but even I had to admit that some of the stuff in  Fahrenheit 9/11  was a stretch.   But enough balanced political discourse. Let us talk about me, for a change. Well, I am doing about the same as usual. No big changes, but my faith in the summer epiphany still stands. After all, I still have a whole month to think, before I go back to Conformity High.   Haven't seen a number of the gang in a while. For a couple weeks, I was sick of everybody, but time apart has made me feel more forgiving towards others. I'm looking forward to resuming normal relations with everyone.  It is kind of depressing that I have had such a wasteful summer. However, I feel that I have not yet fully recovered from the last school year, so just drifting around seems like an honest enough use of my time, for now.   I'd like to return to work for a moment. I am not exactly a "people person," by which I mean that I hate meeting new people, being in large social situations, and pretending to like said people in said situations. People come and go at the Dairison, due to drug use, stealing, and sheer incompentence. Today I had to work with the new girl. Now I'm sure that she is a good person, seemed nice, not exactly well-read but who is in Garrison? This didn't stop me from doing my sacred duty. This duty, of course, was instigating Operation "Total Dick."   Let me interject quick with a brief Op. description. "Total Dick" is my way of alienating people that I have no wish to talk to. During the school year, I use a slightly modified Operation I call "Iron Curtain," in which I respond to the people I don't want to talk to with silence and one-word answers. However, during the summer, I have much more self-esteem due to not always being told that I am wrong, so I actively search to alienate people I don't ever want to talk to/see again.   So, as the name suggests, I be a total dick. It is quite simple. I don't dislike these people, I just don't want to talk to them, especially the majority of my work colleagues. I am there to work (well, really to drink coffee and read the  Tribune ), and I don't need friendships to get in the way of my robotlike efficency.   Long story short, it worked quite well due to my loud banging on things, wearing sunglasses all day and ignoring her, and insinuating that Dairy Queen work was below me. It isn't, but it works better if people think that it is.   A side note: don't try this shit at home. A time or two during the school year, "Iron Curtain" backfired  horribly  on me. It isn't too hard to realize that my avoidance was not schoolboy coquettishness, but an actual aversion to social contact. And sometimes, you alienate people so badly that they think you are actually a total dick, and not just trying to avoid small talk. Case in point: my mom and sister.  Well, somewhere in these operations I am sure I learned a lesson. Anyway, Lupin is on.

      Yes the warped tour was awesome, no we didn't stay in the cities for 4 days. I don't know how Jason and Hobster got that idea. My favorite show's were definately Bouncing Souls and Anti-Flag cause the hit all their best songs and really got the crowd involved, especially Anti-Flag. Speaking of Anti-Flag, they have some crazy violent fans. I didn't want to get involved in the moshing, but the whole crowd was a giant pit so the mosh came to me. I got elbowed in the head and kicked in the face by a crowd surfer. Other than that it was awesome. Got some stuff signed by Bouncing Souls and Tiger Army. Tiger Army also put on a kickass show. Also got a cd signed by 3/4 of the Casualties. I missed the bass player though.    Another thing, the Democratic Convention. You know that you are going to get your ass kicked in an election when fucking Ronald Reagan's son is speaking for Kerry. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

      It has been a while, but I've been unmotivated.  On Sunday I went to Warped Tour. My computer just crashed so here is the abridged version: Bouncing Souls and Anti-Flag killed, Tiger Army, the Casualties, and Flogging Molly were good, and Bad Religion personally rocked each and every of the 15,000 who attended. We got a lot of stuff signed, and I got one really good picture, which I'll put up some other time.   Yesterday, I went swimming and blew a tire.  Today, work. I've been drifting around since I got off work, not really willing to go anywhere but still searching for something to entertain me. I settled on an hour or two of Grand Theft Auto and reading about the history of punk.   I am thinking about forming some serious plans for tomorrow, though. I don't really have any money so I'll probably go up to the Oselands and hang out.  Not much new in politics today. Important Democrats are badmouthing Bush at the DNC, the right is responding with the usual half-truths and exaggerations, and the 12 undecided voters in the country make plans to move to Canada.   (lets hope they were leaning right)  Well, summer is now boring the hell out of me. I have no more plans, and although I am not content to while away the rest of the summer in obscurity, I probably will. I could've did some things differently, but too late for that now, so why second-guess myself?  Why am I speaking of summer like it is already over? August hasn't even started yet, and I celebrate the end of the prior year up until 7 a.m. on the first day of the next.   I kind of want to see I, Robot and the Bourne Supremacy. By which I kind of want to see I mean I will if there is nothing better to do. Now that I think of it, I could've did that today.  Tomorrow, I also could load those CDs I bought into my iPod. I've got 10-12 waiting to be loaded.   Anyway, I can't say I am interested in blogging at the moment.   See ya next time I feel like it.

      It has been a very long time since I&nbsp; have blogged anything.&nbsp; Lets take a look at what has happened.   1) Life (Work) is sooooooooooooooooo much easier now that Rad has taken off.&nbsp; He went to California to see his dad and then he is going to Hawaii.&nbsp; Then school starts for him.&nbsp; He is out of my life for at least a year now.&nbsp; I have to go to St. Cloud next Wednesday to finish my Shift Supervisor&nbsp;training.&nbsp; It is just like a school class for like 8 hours.&nbsp; I have really been working lately.&nbsp; This coming check should have about 80 hours on it.&nbsp;   2) Summer is almost 2/3 over.&nbsp; Where the&nbsp;frick has it gone?&nbsp; I have spent like $150 or so just on some really nice fishing stuff.&nbsp; I got 2 ultralite rods, and 1 reel.&nbsp; 2 walleye/ bass rods with a reel,&nbsp; and about $35 of plastics and crankbaits from one of my neighbors all for $55.&nbsp; Then I have gone to Fleet Farm and Reeds to buy more tackle and a new box.&nbsp; But so far I have been fishing 3 times.&nbsp;  3) My grandma has given me a .22 and a bunch of other stuff that used to be my grandpa's.&nbsp; My mom is scared to death that someone (my brother) will get shot.&nbsp; But thats not much of a loss.  I really haven't done much exept play tennis, and I must say that each time I play houle, our score is very close- well not the set or game score, but each game we are very close.&nbsp; I will beat him this summer.

      Why I am happy today:  New episodes of  Lupin  on Cartoon Network, starting next week. Finally, the will of the people prevail and the greatest TV series in the history of the world is extended beyond the usual ten episodes. Bear in mind that there were hundreds of  Lupin  episodes created in Japan, so the potential for more  Lupin  is extremely high.   On Sunday, we are going to Warped Tour. Just the thought of being four days away from Bad Religion, one of the most influential and relevant punk bands ever formed, makes me shudder with excitement. Not only is  the  BR going to be there, tons of other bands, including Anti-Flag, Flogging Molly, the Casualties, etc are going to be there. It gets better, too. With all the political action/label/band booths, the potential for free stuff is astronomically high. It will be a punk rock baptism of sorts for John and Bryce, who kinda fool around with punk but have never openly declared their undying love for it as I have. Plus, a bunch of other 'punx' I know are going, including the Oselands, Alex, Mike, and Nate.  Tomorrow is the last day of work for this week, meaning that I can finally get more than five hours of sleep a night.   Last week's monotony, despair, and embarrassment have been replaced with cautious optimism. So hooray for me, because I feel much better.  I guess Sandy is going to become a nurse now, so now at least one provider in that family will have a real job. She pretty much flat out said that it was my fault that she didn't become a nurse, to which I replied that it was her fault I didn't become a emotionally stable person. Just kidding. Didn't want to diminish her newfound motivation.   Today was a pretty day, and even the crazies on the right seemed quiet. So, finding no injustice to fight, I drove on down (or is that up?) to the Oselands for some swimming. As soon as I entered Nisswa, it started to rain. So, we played Halo and ate pizza, which was okay in itself but no substitute for Nisswa Lake, which shined a deep blue as I drove past, cursing the weather.  Yeah, like John, I haven't accomplished anything this summer. I didn't set any specific goals at the beginning, other than some vague promises to start thinking clearer and not overexamine things. Well, that didn't pan out, so I decided that pissing my days away probably had some interesting life lessons if I looked close enough. Sure enough, there they were, as soon as I stopped caring.  You can reach Derby's blog at http://no-pancakes.blogspot.com. I'll update the link tomorrow, if I remember.  Tomorrow I have to load some stuff into Beatbox, and go to a movie or something.   Well, I'm about through for tonight.  Ra.

      Why can't you "buy revolution" from a mall? If Chris had bought that shirt and hat from a mall, so what? Why does it change what those pieces of clothing mean? Same with Hot Topic. Sure, they do sell a lot of stuff that really is for the MTV kids. There are some things, though, that aren't, like the Casualties poster. Why is buying that poster there, different than buying it off the internet?

      Last night, I stayed at Bryce's house with Chris, but as usual there was a bunch of other people over there. If you never have been there, Hotel Olshanski is quite a nice place. We had fun, etc, etc.  I'm home now, which I guess is all right. It is much hotter here than at my grandma's house.  Due to the heat, I am don't feel like blogging. Nonetheless, I shall perservere over it and continue.  I was driving today, and Chris made some off-hand remark about Bush. It made me think of the kids at my school, because it sounded just like something a Bush basher would say.   Man, I can't stand people who hate Bush to look cool, so they look like they care. It gives me a headache when people only argue that Bush is stupid. The ignorant scenesters should get the hell out of political activism, because they suck.  Inform yourself . Much of our strength resorts in our willingness to solve things in a civil and informed manner, without name-calling. If you are going to call Bush a greedy fascist, by all means, do so, but make sure you have the  facts  to back the names up. Otherwise, you just hurt us. Blind liberalism is just as bad as blind conservatism. Fact of the matter is, we aren't always right. No one is. We can't set prominent liberals on a pedestal and act like they have no flaws. Case in point: Michael Moore. I am not Rush Limbaugh, and you aren't Bill O'Reilly, so don't act like it, ok?  It goes  much  deeper than George Walker Bush, and all you have to do is look.  Caught up on Derby's blog a few minutes ago. He was talking about stuff he bought, and one thing struck me as particularly interesting. Wearing a Che Guevara T-Shirt to a high school: what a romantic notion. Now, that sounds incredibly sarcastic, I know, but it really is. Think about it: passively mocking all the kids, without them even knowing it!   Nothing screams, "I am a revolutionary," like wearing a shirt with Che's face on it, no doubt purchased from a mall.   I'm sorry, that was uncalled for.   But if you think about it, it is neither tired or cliche. Che's story no doubt mirrors our own. We start out as idealists, who are going to change the world. Some of us will be Fidel Castro, who stay behind in the (relative) safety of Cuba, and some of us will be Che, who will go to die in the jungle of Bolivia for what we believe in.   Who's going to run Cuba? Who will be gunned down by Bolivian Rangers?  Anyway, back to my original point: high school sucks really bad, and every day people passively rebel against it's depressing conformity. Derby, wearing a Che shirt. I don't want to mock  all  the people who attend BHS, because a lot of them are actually cool. However, majority of the people who go there are assholes who only care about getting drunk and following the latest trend. High school is basically training us not to think for ourselves at all. As long as you set the groundwork for social- and government- acceptable goals in high school, you're ok. Hell, if you pick on people who are different than everybody else, you're ok. High school is all about repressing the individual inside us, keeping us inside the comfortable and easily attainable goals our friends and relatives set for us.   Anyway, this is getting kind of long-winded and vague, so here goes: You can't buy rebellion from a mall, BHS sucks, and don't live your life according to the expectations of others.   Every day, someone new becomes disillusioned by their surroundings, and one more person is converted to the Revolution.

       So my dad went on  vacation, but so did I, in a way. A vacation from personal hygeine. A vacation from profound thought. A vacation from spelling and grammar. It has been nice living like Chris for a few days, but tomorrow I vow to return to the real world.  &nbsp;  Today I went shopping in St. Cloud, and spent some money. I got these things at Electric Fetus and Barnes and Noble:  Refused- Shape of Punk to Come  The Essential Clash  Don't Call Me Ska Face- Volumes 1 + 3  The Mighty Mighty Bosstones- Let's Face It  Bad Religion- The Empire Strikes First (vinyl)  Tiger Army- Tiger Army 3: Ghost Tigers Rise! (vinyl)  Lars Fredrickson and the Bastards- Viking (vinyl)  Wesley Willis- The Daddy of Rock and Roll DVD  Two books: One about the history of punk, and one by the author of  Fast Food Nation , but I can't remember the names right now.  &nbsp;  John got some DVDs, and Bryce got some pants and  Evil Dead: Fistful of Boomstick .  &nbsp;  I'm really tired, because I was at Bryce's house last night and I barely slept at all because I felt sick.  &nbsp;  After St. Cloud, I stuck those CDs on my iPod. Now, sleep.  &nbsp;  good night

      I don't think the DOM Amendment will pass either, but that doesn't mean its wrong to try. Separation of church and state also provides against discrimination against churches for being such. If 99% of America followed one religion, you can be sure laws would be appropriately tailored to this religion, not because religion was kept out of state, but because it obviously HAS to play a factor. When electing a candidate, people usually look to their own morals and beliefs for guidance as to whom to choose, and their morals and beliefs are usually governed by their own religions, so there's no way to keep the two separate in reality.    "Those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is." -- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948), [Mahatma] India nationalist, spiritual leader   Bush is only upholding the view that many people on the right, his supporters, also agree with.   Also, your numbers 2 and 17 completely contradict each other.  I have to go and do a whole lot of nothing. Bye. Adios. Auf Wiedersehen. Aloha. Au revior.

      Once again, I am extremely irritated at the heat. My room is too hot to enter, even though I have two fans going in there right now.  I don't know why my room is so hot compared to everywhere else, but it sure sucks.  The big news this week is that on Wednesday, the Senate will be voting on the Defense of Marriage Amendment. Now, chances are that this isn't going to pass, but I am still disgusted at the vile divisionary tactics the right uses. First, to write discrimination into the Constitution 220ish years after is was written is shameful. This is supposed to be a progressive country. Secondly, the motives behind this are pure politics. George isn't going to lose any votes that he already lost by trying to ban gay marriage, but Kerry might by supporting it. This is just the right's noise machine trying to cover up the  real  issues we care about in this election. If we are arguing over gay marriage, we aren't thinking about Iraq, the economy, healthcare, or corporate accountability.   It is about time that George learns that the White House isn't his bully pulpit, and he can't proselyze his religious views at us. The law of the land doesn't come much clearer than the words, "Seperation of Church and State." Not only is he disgracing our country, but his fellow Christians by only following the Bible as it fits him.  I am 95 percent sure that proselyze is a word, but I can't remember how to spell it.  I arose too late in the afternoon to do anything, and I wasn't really in the mood anyway. So I cleaned my room, which took a few hours, and complained about the heat. The high point of my day will be watching Lupin in a while.  I have to work tomorrow, sadly.   Well, I am done for tonight, as Lupin is coming on in a few minutes. Sorry, it feels incomplete to me.

      It is way too hot to blog tonight. It must be 105 degrees in my room, making my attempts to sleep futile.   Today I tried to clean my room, but I decided that I probably would be just sitting around on Monday, and I could clean it then.  Went to  King Arthur  tonight with some people. It was okay.  Well, my dad and Missy are going on vacation somewhere this week, and I am going to hang out with my grandma. Which will be pretty awesome, because my grandma is cool. Pretty much everybody that meets her agrees that she is one of the nicest people ever. She is also really accomodating to my late hours and unwillingness to talk to other people while at home. Here, I have three rules. 1) Take out the garbage 2) Eat dinner with family 3) ....I can't remember what three was. (Maybe don't feed Lilly?) At my grandma's house I expect it will descend into complete anarchy. I view parenting as a mutual partnership between equals, and she does also, so it will go pretty smooth. Plus, I am her favorite grandchild.  Today I bought Jack Kerouac's  On the Road , thinking it would give me some good summer inspiration, and an  Onion  compilation. I have upwards of 15 books on my reading pile, but it has been too damn hot out these last few days to get any serious reading done.  In the news today: More Marines dead in Iraq, Edwards fever is dying down, 'W' Ketchup is launched to combat Heinz Ketchup (something clever from the right! whoa!), and Elvis is high on the charts in Britian. A slow news day, which is appropriate because I try to cut down on the news on Sundays.  The heat makes me nostalgic for last summer, where from 11-4:30 all I did was watch Lupin and complain about the heat. In the day, I just go swimming or go for a drive. At night, all I have to do is blog, read, and listen to music, none of which appeal to me right now.  A plus of being a Night Owl is that you get to catch all the great late-night movies. My favorite late-nighters are Bruce Lee movies and the Blues Brothers. The other night I saw Ready to Rumble, and last night I saw Jay and Silent Bob on Comedy Central, if you can believe that. It seems that the movies are either really great, or horrible flops (Ready to Rumble).   Today Chris mooned Hobe no less than  four  times.   As seems to be their habit, Hawkeye and Jeff have went silent. On Tuesday is Hawkeye's driving test, so good luck to him. I doubt he'll need it, as it is really easy. I expected to fail because I only drove for three hours before taking the test, so if you drive even a little before it, chances are you'll pass.  I'm kind of lacking for ideas right now.  30 Reasons Why I Am Great:  30. Usually, when I am waiting for something to happen, I sit around and it randomly happens.  29. When I go to bed at night I honestly feel that I have sabotaged the current social structure, and soon the Revolution will be here and I'll be glad for all the work I did. 28. Unless you are Bruce Campbell, I'm better than you. 27. I haven't yet been entangled in a shallow relationship which would withdraw from my self-esteem bank and ruin my current way of living. 26. I find myself interesting and engaging, which is why I spend so much time alone rather than with other people. 25. I believe that the Truth is out there. 24. I have alienated everyone I have met without coming across as a creepy X-Files fan. 23. I am different from my parents. 22. I am not ignorant. 21. My shoes. 20. I've been shot in the mouth six times, yet I keep rapping. 19. I've been rocking and rolling long enough to do damage to my body, but I don't believe in drugs or alcohol. 18. If I don't know what I am talking about, I keep going anyway, because chances are the other person knows even less than I do. (Hah!) 17. I have a pretty good grasp of concepts and ideas, yet when it comes to individual people I have no idea what I am talking about. 16. I have a T-shirt that says 'Emo Sucks.' 15. On a global level, I care immensely about causes and beliefs. On a social level, I care about change and understanding. On a personal level, I care only about myself. It is good to be a selfish jerk, because if I wasn't I'd probably listen to emo or something. 14. I don't watch late night talk shows. 13. I don't take 'no' for an answer. 12. I am self-serving, yet I don't often cross the line into pretentiousness. 11. Lilly is my dog. 10. I can read really, really fast. 9. My hair is aesthetically pleasing (especially before I got it cut). 8. I make fun of things I don't understand. 7. Bling Bling Bailey, Lord of the Brainerd Underworld, is my sister. 6. I fought the law (and I won) 5. I am an old-school musical purist, not an indie snob but a real elitest asshole, the kind that makes you sick. I am  always  right when it comes to music, and I have trod on the faces of many people who have tried to convince me otherwise. 4. I can play "Made in NYC" on my guitar,  and  I know all the lyrics. 3. I can say that people are better off for having met me.  2. I am pretty perceptive, by which I mean I read people pretty well. It always feels like an intuitive thing, and I usually know when someone is lying, even if I don't let on at the time. 1. At the end of the day, I'm just doing it for the Cause, to quote Fat Mike. I really have no other reason, no higher purpose, other than to be. So hooray for me, for not reading into things too deeply, having nice hair, and waiting for things to randomly happen.  If you can think of thirty reasons why you are great, I'd like to hear them.

      An interesting discussion on punks. That's mostly it.  I'ven't done much of anything recently. Derby might actually end up working at Culver's, though I can't see how that guy could keep a job there. Too objectionable.   I'm busy nights until like friday.  Still, I'm sensing a lack of drive to play Fable. I just don't get it maybe.  I'm also at a loss of blogging ability. Whatever.

      Well, first of all, about Warped Tour. I think I have my mom pretty well talked into it. The main reason she doesn't think it's a good place is because my older cousin, who is 31, always tells her what it was like 15 years ago. "This one time, there was this huge circle of skin heads dancing in a circle and they tore off their shirts and threw them in a big pile and lit it on fire. Everyone else was smoking pot pretty much." God, Josh, don't tell her that.  About Pammy, Chrissy (Chris, you and Hanna would get along wonderfully, I think) can settle down and go for Kali/Hanna. The reason I didn't say anything about it is because I didn't know what was going on and don't know what is going on.  Man, my face does hurt. It feels like hell. Not only did they cut open my gums, but they had to cut into the bone to dig the teeth out... Ouch... Thank god for the painkillers.

      It has been awhile, but I've been busy.  The reason the sidebar doesn't work is because the picture pushes it over. When it exits the recent posts, it should go back to normal.  I'm pretty sure that it is Saturday, and here is a recap of what I have been up too:  On Thursday I got off work and just shuffled around for a few hours because Chris had to work. Later on in the night I went over to John's house and loaded some new stuff into Beatbox. Yesterday, I went over to the Oselands place in the morning and went swimming. Me and Chris later met Hobe, Bryce, and Irene and went to  Anchorman . It was kind of funny, but I wasn't expecting much from it. The best part was when Jack Black dropkicked a dog off a bridge. Later on me and the Oselands went over to Bryce's house, where a bunch of people were sitting around, and proceeded to sit around all night, listening to 2nd wave ska and discussing politics and friendship. A couple of times it came to blows between me and Chris, and one time I ran down a hall to flying tackle Bryce, but he tripped me and I went flying into a door, which hurt.  We woke up this morning, feeling tired and irritable due to the late night, and went back to the Oselands. Erik made us pancakes, we sat around for a couple hours more, and I went home. I've had a bad headache all day, and it feels like I have a fever. Tomorrow I guess I will do something more interesting, after I have had some sleep.   About Fable: who cares? It is only a video game. The reason it everyone thinks it will be so great is that it has been hyped endlessly by Microsoft, and whether people realize it, the enthusiasm behind it is mainly because Microsoft-funded magazines have given it rave reviews. If it is good, cool. If not, cool. Either way it isn't worth spending hours talking about it. I have a Gamecube, and I never play it, and my PS2 is used only for playing DVDs.   Some entertainment-related interjections:  Bands I am looking forward to seeing at Warped Tour: Flogging Molly Anti-Flag Bouncing Souls Bad Religion (!!!) NOFX Tiger Army Lars Frederickson and the Bastards The Vandals  Rise Against The Casualties (God, I hope they play Made in NYC) The Briggs Big D and the Kids Table Somerset Letter Kills Duane Peters and Die Hunns Sadly, I do not think that I will be able to see all these bands in one day. Not only do I have to watch all of them, I have to visit all the awesome booths, which are at least 25% of the reason I go. But I will see some of them for sure (Bad Religion, the Souls, Anti-Flag, the Casualties, Duane Peters). I might have to skip some in order to see at least one band at each of the nine stages. Yeah, no doubt we will all splinter apart when we get there in order to pursue our own interests. We all want to see different bands, although we'll probably get together to meet some of our heros (Greg Graffin!!!!!!!). I want to check out the political action booths, and go shopping in addition to seeing the abovementioned bands, Chris will want to go check out the ska bands, Erik will want to go see Atmosphere and chase skirts, etc. So far these people are planning on going: Me  Chris Erik Mike  Speedy (Mike's Brother) Alex  Bryce Nate Joe John, mom's permission pending.   Seriously, it isn't bad or dangerous or anything. I know that it has changed to cater to screamo and pop-punks in recent years, but it still has plenty to offer for the True Believers. It is like a Woodstock for punks, a place where you can see all of your heroes in one day. This year, there will be so much to do that I am afraid that I will miss something. During the day,we will be checking out our favorites, shopping, meeting the bands, collecting free stuff, heckling sellouts, and seeing the little known and local bands.  I just finished reading this book called  Scary Monsters and Super Freaks , by Mike Sager. It is this collection of stories that have been printed over the years in magazines like  Rolling Stone  and  GQ . I recommend it to any pop-culture fan, as it has some excellent stories in it. After that, I moved on to a book called  The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi , by Salam Pax, the most famous blogger in history. His accounts of daily life in Iraq are interesting, and easy to understand, if you're into that.  I picked up Audio Karate's  Lady Melody  in the Gallery the other day for five bucks, but I haven't listened to it yet. Chris got a bunch of old ska CDs for nine bucks, and they are actually pretty good, especially if you are into stuff like the Specials, the Clash, and Op Ivy. While in the Gallery, this music-hipster dude was trying to impress the girls at the desk with his music knowledge, and me and Chris started mocking him when he started talking about Sleater-Kinney. He didn't really realize we were doing it, so intensely was he concentrated on getting the girl's phone number (the one that likes the Beastie Boys), but after a while we started talking about vinyl with him and decided he wasn't such a bad guy, even if he looked like he belonged on  the O.C.   We haven't all did something together for a while. Tomorrow, we should go get a pizza or something.   In other news, my dad started selling those little pocket bike motorcycles and now hundreds of strangers flock to my house every night to buy them. My dad is a pretty savvy businessman, something I fear I am hopelessly lost in. I don't really care about business or money, adhering to the philosophy that money comes and goes. But anyway, I read in the  Star Tribune  the other day that pocket bikes are the next big fad. So, looks like he is ahead of the curve on that one.  The greatest rock and roll band of all time: Bradley Nowell, Jorge, Wesley Willis, and Jello Biafra.  Right now, I am listening to  Get Ready , by Sublime.  We haven't talked about anything serious for a while on the blog. Actually, it has grown fat off the complacency of its bloggers in the third month of its existence. I propose a de-bloating of this abomination and a return to business as usual. I mean, I haven't called one of my fellow bloggers a bad name in probably two weeks.   Oh yeah: I heard John and Pammy broke up. When I asked Jan about it, he said, "sort of," and refused to say anything else. I mean, come on: I heard about this from Chris Derby, not John. I would venture to say that I am one of John's best friends, and I had to hear about it from one of his enemies. Chris was talking about Pammy, and I told him, and he said, "Fuck yeah! Now she is fair game for me!" He went on to remark that Kali was "hot," and he would take a shot at Hannah also if she wasn't so obviously crazy.  Keep staying classy, Chris.  Seriously, I'm sorry for you, John. I won't say I told you so, even though I already warned you. But hey, I'm wrong most of the time, aren't I? I won't laugh at you, or anything, because I am a  supportive friend . Just remember: if you get lonely, there is always Karla to turn to.   Ah, to be a teenager in love.

      Now I am going to try and describe this game, and why it has the chance of being one of those games that will be remembered for years to come, like FFVII. Take in mind that while I am typing this I just took 3 advil, a vicodin and a antibiotic and have been for the past 18 hours, bear with me. Different sections may bleed into eachother.  Storyline/Effects of Actions: The story starts you out as a 15 year old boy whos parents have just been killed (and his dog nailed to the door of his house). In this first part, you do "kid" things and is basically I warm up for the rest of the game. Imagine it as a really big tutorial. To give an example, a merchant may ask you to watch his items and if you do he will give you money. Now the goody-goody thing to do would be to watch his stuff and accept the money. The neutral thing would be to just take some stuff without accepting his offer. The evil thing would be to take his stuff and accept his offer. Now unlike in a game like Morrowind, this game spans your characters whole lifetime, and small choices can have unseen consequences in the future. For example, when you grow up, this merchant could remember your thieving ways and sell to you at insanely high prices, or not at all. If this happens, you can kill him, and if you do he won't come back. This can also have large effects. For example his relatives and friends will hate you, bandits and such will come to revere you and you could get a nice big bounty on your head so a  different  cpu controlled hero in the game could come kill you. After you are a kid, you age and become older and continue aging throughout the game. This game has a main story line, but basically, you can completely ignore it if you want and can continue playing long after you complete it. There are also literally hundreds of side quests to keep you busy. Unlike a lot of games, these side quests are actually worth your time. The rewards won't be a can (because we aren't all goats) they could be anything from money, exp or maybe a new sword. Going along with this sword thing, the sword you use will eventually come legendary. It may even get its own name depending on what you do. You can even use a frying pan as a weapon, so I'm going for the name of "Griddle of Justice." Your own character can also get a unique nickname depenidng on his actions. Such things as your tattoos or your hairdo will also become legendary. Someday, you may wander into town and you will see a punk with YOUR haircut and one of YOUR tattoos. Now, if you were badass you would kick his ass. If you were goody goody you would pat his head and say good boy. Throughout, you will also have rival heros that people can also idolize, so you may also see an army of "archnemesises." Going further into the effects of action part, if you were to say be bad, you would start looking bad. Your skin would get white, your eyes begin to turn red, lose hair, get a evil, fiery aura around you, grow horns, and have flies start flying around you. Good on the other hand will give you lighter hair, a glowing compexion, higher cheekbones, a halo, a light glowing aura and butterflies fluttering around your head. Also, there are a number of normal towns. These towns will throw a welcome party if you are famous for your good deeds. If you are evil, they will hide in their houses where they wait for you to slaughter them. Your home town is different, it will love you no matter what, much like a modern day Ghengis Khan. Then there is the bandit town, the Pequot of the game. This is where the killers and robbers hide out and these guys will easily accept your evil side.  Fighting/weapons: Fighting is pretty simple. Basically you use combos of buttons to use a melee weapon, and every so often if you get enough hits in a row without being hit you can unleash a special attack with a sweet, short cinematic. You can also fight with a bow. Pretty simple. Now your actualy weapons will evolve with you. You can add jewels, ingravings, or cuts for every kill you get. In this way, your weapon will ride your coattails to stardom. People will recognize it as easily as they recognize you. The other form of fighting is through magic. Basically, you press a button and unleash your magic. There are around 10 different spells I think that each have around 10 levels that you can level them to. Most of the spells are either bad or neutral on that scale, but 2 or 3 are considered "good." So, fighting is pretty simple. You have a health meter and a magic meter. Crap dies when you whack it with your "Griddle of Justice" or when you zap it with a lvl 10 chain lightning.  The World/Graphics/Quests: The world is big. It would take a huge amounts of hours to explore every nook and cranny. But you don't have to look everywhere. All you have to do is go to your right temple (either the good one for goody goodies or the evil one for badasses). Here, you can find people looking for jobs done. Often, there will be a good side to a quest and a bad side. For example, the good temple may have a quest that says rescue town full of people from bandits. The evil half of the quest may say help group of business men deal with trouble makers in town. In this way, things aren't black and white and you may have to read both halves to figure out the real story. The graphics also look pretty good. With characters showing emotion and the such it looks pretty nice. Not going to say its the best animation, but it definately will get the job done and then some. If you want to see it for yourself go look at some screenshots at:  urlLink here . The world's enviroment is also heavily effected by your playing. If you cut down a tree, you will find the stump years later. If you carve something along the lines of "J0hN 1s L33t" it will be there forever unless you scratch it out. Why would you scratch that out though?  Now I have spent a lot of time playing games. Some of my favorites are action RPGs like Metal Gear Solid or Zelda. The only thing wrong with these games is that they lack the option of what to do. Zelda did a good job of fixing this in Wind Waker because it is  so  god damn fun to sail around. Unfortunately, sailing won't win the game for you. Enter: Fable. Now these hours spent avoiding the main quest can have huge benefits. Or, instead of questing, you can sit in your house with the wife and eat food and get fat. Or, you can just become a serial killer and kill every in your town and get the nickname "Chester the Molester." Then, you could have the whole town to yourself. Sweet.  Basically this game combines the best elements of hack and slash, morrowind and an rpg into one game. Comparing Morrowind to this is like comparing the original Zelda to Ocarina of time. It is like comparing Diablo to Diablo II. It is just one game that goes places the other game only dreamed of or hinted at. If anyone has other questions go ahead and ask. Now it is 6 and these pills rock. I can't type very well. On almost every word I have to go back and fix it. That's why it took me an hour. I will type a sample sentence. Today, am i playn on...WTF... I didn't even mean to type that. I was going to try to say "Today, I plan on..." Whatever. I'm going to go eat some ice cream and drink some liquid drink.

      Well I've finally surfaced from the black hole of Xbox. I've come to take a breather before I submerge myself again. With it we bought Halo and Topspin, a very good tennis game, as well as the DVD playback kit. After I was at work, Matt and Zoe snuck behind my back and bought the Sims Bustin' Out. It makes me sad that Hobester made a remark to me about it and less than 24 hours later it was in my posession.  A good Conan on tonite - not a rerun, a rare treat from that show. Jim Gaffigan is on there, which means its gonna be good.  Fable... sounds a whole lot like Morrowind. I can't distinguish betwixt the two as John tells all. I lost my enchantment with Morrowind for PC very quickly with the poor controls and lack of finesse in battle. Faster than I lost it for Neverwinter Nights with a mind-dulling repetitiveness, reoccuring each time in a different sheep's clothing. Not to mention a horridly over-inflated currency system. There's little I hate more than one of those.   The main Xbox game I'm looking forward to adding to my collection of 4, after of course Halo 2, is Blinx: The Time Sweeper. It's an exciting adventure about a janitorial cat who travels through time. I played a demo once and I love it. The sheer strategy of it allows for hours upon months of gameplay.  Currently, I'm liking Topspin, though it's potential for being a long-lasting favorite wanes. It can support 4 players, making a dubs tourney a definite possibility. With the high levels of customization, especially in the department of appearance, I've come up with the idea of recreating a number of the BHS tennis team onto the game, each with respective strengths and weaknesses. This decision was not a little spurned on by the fact that the very first character created bore and unintentional but eerily unsettling resemblence of Stanek. Oh well.  You got the way to move me. Ah, Neil Diamond, when will you ever stop rocking so hardcore?

      MADE IN NYC LYRICS: FROM MY MEMORY AT LEAST...  Sniffing glue, drinking beer dont give a fuck how the hippies feel this is for you joey your memory fucking lives your three cord wonders made in nyc   gaba gaba hey, punk is here to stay hey ho lets go sniffing glue all day  gaba gaba hey, punk is here to stay hey ho lets go sniffing glue all day  blitzkrieg bop punk is found on the street corner of my home town  they called you dumb the punks heard the noise   cant remember anymore. Enough casualties. King Arthur came out today. Anyways, Lamb Effect actually doesn't play punk, or ska. They play skunk. This is found at their website. urlLink Home of Lamb Effect  Homeless Man is really an amazing song. Gotta work tomorrow bright and early at 930. Mattson and I get to work with Pokegama and Lewis.  Today, right when we were leaving work, Mattson saw this sweatshirt that sad Lewis on the back. He assumed it was Lewis' shirt. So, I looked on the front and it was a Crosby-Ironton Girls Basketball shirt. Not only was I confused, I was struck down with laughter. It was then that I recalled that one of the girl's last names was Lewis. So, Lewis' short run as coach of the CI B-ball team was over.  Tried to fix that cassette deck today. Sat outside during my break and punched it for a while and then tried to clean it. Didn't work. I think it needs a good beating. Here are some upcoming songs on my Playlist. First is Operation Ivy - Bad Town. Then we have some of Led Zep's The Ocean. Following is Nirvana, Clapton and Less Than Jake with The Man Who Sold the World, Layla and All My Best Friends Are Metal Heads. And the list stretches on from there. On this particular program, the highest rated song is Homeless Man. Where is that Song?  It's about half past midnight, i was in an alley it was out of sight I looked around couldnt see but i felt something grab me looked down to my surprise it was a homeless man lying in cardboard and rags pulled out a tin cup and said hey man do you got any change?  hey you there homeless man come and take my hand you can live with me for free  hey you there homeless man come and take my hand you can live with me for free   i asked him what his story was he said he was out on the streets just because no one would give him a second chance now what are you gonna do when no one is willing to help you? or give you a helping hand?  chorus x2  solo  nows he off the streets (MEMORY BLANK)he marches to a new drum a different beat no one tellin him get a job you slob  now hes in a town of his own, a place of his own, a place he that he can call home  because no one would give him a helping hand, hes doing just fine  Keep on typing, typing. Now its 1230. Still going. Bryces tomorrow? thats what I hear. Halo possibly? Speaking of the boxx, this new game that is coming out that is called Fable looks really cool. Now, I know hobie has been talking about it for years, but i only just shrugged it off as microsofts attempt at an rpg to grab some busnass. But after looking at it, it looks really, really fun. It is a mix between knights of the old republic, black and white and diablo. Now, just with diablo and black and white in the mix it sounds fricking cool. I think i spent at least 1000 hours playing diablo. That is a sick amount of doing anything, especially playing a game. I think I probably measure in close to 1000 on wc3. The only thing that could come close to that would be gta and that would only be around 100-400 hours i think. Anyways, fable is an "open rpg" meaning you can do whatever the hell you want, pretty much. There is a linear story line but you can ignore it and do sidequests or just do nothing. Also, the world is heavily effected by what you do. For example, if you kill a person, they are gone for good and everyone associated with that person will hate you. Going with this theme, you become good or evil depending on your actions. So you either hang with the good-to-shoos (???) or you're badass and you kill crap randomly. Although killing crap randomly is very appealing, I couldnt deal with everyone wanting to kill me constantly. I can see myself playing that game for a very long time. In order to do this I would have to get a box, good thing my cousin is selling his for 50 bucks.   Right now this song im listening to is very soothing. It is Sugar in you gas tank by Less than jake. I like it a lot. I think I was talking about King Arthur earlier? I think we should see that, although I think it is going to be a lot like Pirates of the Caribean. King Arthur should have been made like Gladiator, not by Jerry Bruckheiemer who after his last success is probably going for a repeat. If he ruins it I am going to hunt him down and shoot a arrow into his face and then kill him with my sword. Hahahaha. Man, that makes me wish I still had Hellsing on my TiVO. I liked watching Alucard fight the Crazy Priest. That anime is truly cool. It is right up there with Bebop and Trigun in my book.

      Despite my dad's best efforts, he was unable to fix my tape deck. So, tomorrow I'll call Radio Shack and see if they can fix it.  Something important happened today, but I can't remember what.   Too excited about Lupin too post anything. Tomorrow night, I'll probably be staying somewhere else but if I am home I'll blog longer.   Worked, came home, ate at Lou's. Read, listened to "Made in NYC," which I am now convinced is the greatest song ever written.  I can hear the opening strains of the Lupin theme song already...

      Starting tonight, Lupin is coming back to Cartoon Network. I am so happy right now, I can't even put it into words.   Lupin the  fucking  Third.

      Yeah, I'll email you the info for it.   Today, I bought some books and gas. I went to  Spiderman  again, and now I feel sick to my stomach. So, I'm going to keep it short tonight.  I lost  Galaxies , sorry. I looked for it a while ago but couldn't find it. It'll probably turn up eventually.  CD I am currently listening to: Operation Ivy's  Energy .  John, sometime this week I need to load the remainder of those songs into Beatbox.  Other than I might perhaps throw up in a few minutes, nothing is happening.  Good night.

      In actuality, Jason, old people do not flock to this resort loving tourist attraction we call Minnesota. Being a master of the studies of the movement of population in the United States, it is known to me that all the old people move south, not to Minnesota. So a lot of the conservatives here in Brainerd are actually middle age rednecks.  Got my fattest paycheck yet, 183.55 dollars. That's right, cold hard American dollars. The green stuff. So that puts the Ipod fund at: 326.25  Eh eh, not bad, eh? Eh, eh Donny Boy? Heeeyyy mmmaaannn, remember that one time man, when I rode a wheelie down the driveway? You remember eh, Donny? Hey man, right? You tell em Donny, I rode that wheelie. What's that man, the phones ringing? It's Danny? Tell that niggo I'm not here. Man, give it to Chris instead. Give the Niggo the phone, man. NNNNIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOO.   PS Mattson, you wanna share the image hosting account? I'm too lazy to make my own.  PPS My hunt for the elusive "spam turkey" is over. I finally hunted it down. If it had some image hosting I might... How do you put images in blog posts?

          Here is Slick, Dustin, Mike, Alex, Erik, Chris, Me, John, my haircutter, Bryce, Joel, Irene, and a bunch of others with the BACP on the Fourth.  Yeah, we weren't allowed to give people the finger or even reply to their heckling. I hadn't planned on it, but Chris (and others) were pissed at what they were saying. Not because they were disagreeing, but that they were cursing at us in front of all those people.  Yeah, the Casualties rock. I don't know why Hobe dislikes Bob Marley solely because he smoked pot. Actually, here is Rastafarianism in a nutshell: Rastafarians believe that Haile Selassie, the former emporer of Ethiopia, was a living god who would lead them to an African promised land. However, he died in 1975. Other aspects of their beliefs including smoking the holy herb of enlightenment, "ganja" (marijuana), every day, and wearing their hair in dreadlocks. It is a quasi-Christian movement, whom many refer to as a cult. They believe that "Babylon" (aka Whitey) changed much of the Bible to give them the power in the world. Long story short, smoking pot is a part of their religion.   I seriously am planning on doing G+B, but it is going to take a freaking long time. I'll start tomorrow, ok?  A short distinction: "Never Had to Knock on Wood" is a song by the ska band  The Mighty Mighty Bosstones . Ska is a sort of music that uses swing and reggae influences, using horns in their songs and only playing upstrokes on their guitars. Reggae is the sort of slower, steel drum music with a vague political message at times.   My dad fixed three out of my four blinkers today! Starting tomorrow, I am declaring my car 45 percent-safe for the road. This means that I'll drive to work for once, instead of John.  I believe tomorrow is Tuesday, which means half-off car washes, which means I get the Mega Wash for $3.50 at the gas station on the way to Garrison. My gaskets leak really bad so I'll make sure to bring towels with to block the water.  Song mix...once Hawkeye gets his songs in John can get a-burnin'.   Today, I woke up late in the afternoon, found myself in a foul mood, and decided to stay home. I read some, watched  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , and cleaned my room partially.   What I plan on buying tomorrow: Gas (My first full tank in 1,050 miles!) a CD or two That Salam Pax diary about Iraq (I can't remember what it is called) Car Wash Happiness or Love, whichever is cheaper  Well, good night.

      I was scheduled to work from 12-7. Right after I got off break at 4:20 the manager asked me if I wanted to go. So yeah, went to the parade. I sat in front of the library. I sat on the curb and kept an eye on my little cousins. It was funny because the people handing out candy sort of gave me weird looks like I was too old for candy, then didn't give me any. I got laughs, but no candy. Some racing float or something came along. They were handing out a few flags. Others got American flags, but I opted for the checkered flag. I waved it animatedly as the BACP "marched" by, but Mattson was staring directly ahead, John was strutting, the rest of 'em were being swept on by the giant crowd. I was sadly unseen.   Though I disagreed with the message BACP was marching for, I still applauded them. I also applauded when a bunch of horses crapped right in front of where I was sitting. The only time I didn't applaud was when I was scrounging me some candy or waving my checkered flag.  On a quick side note, Tickle told me my IQ is 147 and my theme song is "Back in Black." I must admit, I do like that guitar.  Back to blogging. Did you know "blog" isn't included in the the blogger spellcheck? Anyway, of course there are folks being this way. I'm frankly shocked that Mattson goes on and on about all this. We live in the midwest, a humongous resort, tourism, and retirement area. As old folks move in and ore miners move out, the state's votes swing Republican. The old conservatives are set in their ways.    My tactic was to look at the biggest hecklers and smile as widely as I could at them.   I'm shocked. Something Mattson morally does that I feel I should applaud. Sometimes it's the ones you least expect.  In other nagging news... Galaxies and Beyond WoT RPG Song Mix  Too many chiefs, not enough indians! Too much planning, not enough working. This is what you're doing; this is what I want you to do.  To the Hobster Jetpack Amadeus Yoshihanna Slowbie: Only game so far is Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. Which is okay since we don't have the console yet. When it arrives, we'll get Halo and Topspin for sure.  I think I like the Casualties. And a lot of the dirty reggae Mattson listens to too. Not necessarily the lyrics, but if its got a good beat, or even better some awesome harmony/dissidence, mainly notes/chords themselves. I love the harmony in "Never had to Knock on Wood." Listening to "Mrs. Robinson," check out the chord change in the two measures before they start singing. I pull hair out of my scalp every time I hear that, it's so awesome.   Had a tennis tourney in Elk River today. Got up half and hour before needed to get there half and hour before needed, don't ask me why. Hobe and PK won first round, then got schooled by Ronning and John's Willmar friend - Jesse Forsell. I don't think he's with Willmar anymore... we saw him at Alex, right Johnny V? You can back me up on this one.  Me and Jefe lost right away, then won, won, then waited about 3 hours for the other bracket to catch up for consolation. After leading 5-2, they stepped it up, Jefe and I started totally biffing them at the net, and Geoffrey's service game went to pot. We lost 10-7, so it kinda sucked, but we got good experience from it, and had some fun doing it. Excpet hobe and pk, who mostly sat around since they were already out.  I'll see y'all some other time.

      Yesterday was a good day. First, we marched around with the BACP. Got to see the guy that cut both my and Mattson's hair last. Actually, I think there were more people that turned their backs on us/flipped us off/said something negative to us then there were people who actually supported us. The majority of people kept their opinions to themselves though.   After that we went to sit on the hill and wait... The best part of the wait was when some people were going to sit in front of us and Airick just says, "III'mm rrriich." The people just looked at Airick and walked away. Finally, after hours of waiting, the fireworks started. They were the best fireworks I have ever seen in Brainerd. We also got to watch huge chunks of burning ash slam into people. That was pretty funny.

      Today I experienced a renewal of faith in the American people. Upon arriving at the parade with Bryce and Irene, we saw the BACP float just as the parade was starting. I had planned on not marching, but seeing Alex, Chris, Erik, Mike, and Slick Rick protesting was too much to sit out of and I joined them at the forefront. John, Bryce, and Irene proceeded to join us. As we marched, we got many more cheers and peace signs than boos. The boos were mostly from old men and rednecks, the cheers from ordinary citizens. We got flipped off quite a few times, swore at, called "cowards" (as if these conservatives would march in front of all these people), and me and Erik were sprayed by a fire hose. All in all, a fun time. The jeers from the (mostly) ignorant only strengthened our cause. What is the point of saying to a twelve year old, "You little red-headed bitch! I'll show you what's right!"? My tactic was to look at the biggest hecklers and smile as widely as I could at them. Plus, during the parade I got to scope out where everyone I was looking for was at.  I didn't say anything about psuedos in my post. They weren't trying to be punks, indeed "What's Left of the Flag to Me" is a folk song, and I was just using it as an example of how everything gets corrupted and turned into something I don't like anymore.   ...at Battle of the Bands, Erik yelled, "Emo sucks!", and Hannah said, "Better an emo kid than a pseudopunk." That made me laugh.   Oh, and the hecklers told us that they hoped we got drafted.  Don't they get the fucking point? The reason we are protesting is because we want the killing of each other to stop. I don't see what is cowardly about wanting peace. I don't want to die or kill, and I don't want anyone else to have to either.   Afterwards we all went on the hill, got the best spot, and sat there for four hours. A bunch of people came through the grass, we saw the fireworks, and afterwards Gail wouldn't let Chris go to Bryce's house because she thought we were going to go get wasted or something, and everyone ended up going home.  Hawkeye and Jeff seem to have gone AWOL. I have a whirlwind social schedule, but I still find time to blog. I'd like to know what is going on with everyone, as I hate using a telephone.  On the agenda for tomorrow: swimming. On Tuesday, I get paid the fattest paycheck ever, and I plan on buying gas, CDs, and books. So I have that to look forward to.  Rock over London, Rock on Chicago.

      I'd like to wish everyone a Merry Fourth of July. It doesn't have to be happy, really, just merry.  Saw Spidey. That lady with the violin. Oh man... the movie itself wasn't really better than the first, but it built on what the first had established so as to make it a better all-around experience.   Also, the guys who played Flogging Molly ended up winning the Battle of the Bands... Furthermore, upon hearing Mattson's angry (what else?) rant against the psuedopunks, i've come to realise the only REAL punks in this world are actually Mattson and the Oselands. Nobody else qualifies. They're all pseudos, since they don't know what they're talking about.  So can one be an individualist without being punk? I think so. It's possibly better. Individualists would simply do whatever fits themselves best, whereas punks or noncomformists would have their views shaped by society as much as conformists would, only that theirs would be oppositely polarized. Don't work to go against society, because that's as little yourself as going with it.   All I know is that those guys won the Battle of the Bands. Is this not what they set out to do? Yes, it is. They acheived this by performing, pretty well, in fact, the tried and true songs that people already are known to like. Songwriting is a skill, not so much a talent - very few young people have the ability to write decent songs. Even the Newmans' songs began to wear on me after long enough, and all three of those guys rock. It was only the good stuff I could bear.

      Today was an idyllic summer day. I can't say I accomplished anything, but I had fun.  Upon waking up, I showered and headed up to the Oselands to see what they were doing. After some arguing, we agreed on swimming. Then, we couldn't decide on where to swim. I wanted to go to the Point, and Chris wanted to go to Grand View. Erik didn't care, but it was his turn to drive today. After I pointed out to Chris that he lived on a lake and it would be stupid to go to Grand View, he said he would be right back. I went back to reading  Auto Trader , only to hear a strange noise a few minutes later. Erik burst into the house, and attacked me with a leaf blower, blowing things everywhere, while Chris stole my keys, wallet, and phone. Then, they left me at their house for an hour while they went to Grand View.  A brief interjection about GV: It really sucks, if you haven't been there. The tourists there are always of the rich asshole variety, and everyone is condescending to you. I don't mind going in the winter but in the summer it is really unpleasant. As this is the weekend of the Fourth, I knew it would be packed with Tourons from the Twin Cities.  When they got back, we went out on the boat on Nisswa Lake. At first we swam, but after a while we just drifted around the lake in the boat, enjoying the day. While doing this, we discussed the parade and the BACP. I have to work tomorrow, but Chris and Erik said that they would be would be marching with them. I don't think that I would anyway, because I am mad at them for bowing to pressure. Really, BACP isn't a group of people looking to stir up trouble. It is just a bunch of middle-age hippies looking to placate everyone. When I first went there, I expected to see revolutionaries, people seriously committed to far-sweeping social change. Instead what I got were people who only wanted unconditional peace. It is something I agree with, but I think that they go about their methods wrong. However, I applaud their courage to show their displeasure with the current state of affairs in front of 50,000 (according to the parade organizers) red-blooded, short-sighted, naive Americans on the day when you are supposed to be showing your love for America. If I get to the parade in time, I will give them my whole-hearted support. I won't, however, march with a group of people who bow to pressure. The whole point of the coffins were to bring home the realities of the war to people. We protest the war because it came around under  false pretenses . There is no evidence of WMD's, no evidence of an Iraq-Al Queda link, no threat to our nation. The reason these soldiers went into combat is because they thought America would be attacked, and it wasn't going to be. I know Saddam is a bad guy (Even though some of his worst atrocities, including the Kurdish massacre, are now being refuted by the  CIA  and the British government). However, that doesn't mean that  tens of thousands  people should die to get him out of office. Look at the consequences of the war. Can you really say America is safer now that it was when Saddam was in power? Is Iraq safer? Absolutely not. The ill will we have brought upon ourselves by invading and occupying a soverign nation is horrifying to think about. Not only did we occupy Iraq, we also humiliated Iraqis. The Abu Gharib prison scandal has set back relations with the Middle East decades. The Red Cross said 90 percent of the people in Abu Gharib were innocent, that some of them were being held for things such as traffic violations, and that the Army didn't even keep track of where which prisoners were held where. Iraq is teeming with suicide bombers, different fundamentalist Islamic sects, and American war profiteers. Iraqis hate Americans, and 80 percent of them want us out of their country  now . This was a war waged for oil and money, and instead of putting together a cohesive message that this is an unjust war, the BACP gets wishy-washy and chooses to send out a unconvincing message that war is not the answer. This is their biggest chance they'll ever have to send a message to the people, and they weaken it so as to make it to not make an impact at all. Sure, you'll have your conservative hecklers, your liberal supporters, but you won't sway the undecideds.   Anyway, let me move on.   After we drifted around for a couple hours we went to Rafferty's, and had some breadsticks and lemonade. I didn't even have to pay, as Chris got his first paycheck yesterday. Right around the time we left it started to pour. So, we repaired to the garage for an evening of mindless entertainment. The Oselands have two garages: Gail, and Poop's shop. I use the word garage loosely, because Poop's garage has a stage for concerts, complete with PA and instruments, an office, bathroom, and big screen TV. It also has your more traditional garage things. I hooked up some video games, Erik banged on Mike's beautiful new Pearl drums, and Chris somehow managed to hook my iPod into his record player/garage sound system. We played video games and listened to Wesley Willis all evening. And that brings me up to here.   I think I am done now, so good night.

      Somewhere along the line, today went horribly wrong.  I can't consciously explain it. I am in a really foul mood right now. I feel emotionally bad, and physically sick to my stomach. It started earlier, when I was at Battle of the Bands. I took a look around, and I asked myself what the hell I was doing there. From that moment on, I was sick of everyone and didn't want to see anyone else until I felt better. I no longer enjoyed the Battle and left with Erik, because I couldn't believe the kids there. Looking around at the Hot Topic goths, fashion skaters, metalheads, pretentious indie assholes, emo fans, and pop-punks, I asked myself,  Is anything real anymore?  Why does everything have to be a big show? I'm sick of going through the motions with everyone else. I want to  accomplish something . It feels like every conversation I have with another person has been played out and nothing new will come out of it. I'm sick of suspecting everything is fake. I wish I could turn off my natural pessimism, but I always have to see the bad in people. I don't mean to be an elitest, to insult other people, but  I can't help it .  Today I ventured to Brainerd's Battle of the Bands, at first with John and Pammy. I met a bunch of people I knew there (including Fish Boy and Chris Derby!), we talked, it rained, etc, etc. I ended up spending the majority of the time with Erik, some girl Erik brought along, Alex, and Nate Lucas. A bunch of people ended up coming through our particular spot on the grass, though. The music mostly sucked, your cookie-cutter blend of screamo, metal, and pop-punk-emo. It was kinda what I expected, though. Joe's band was pretty good. After Joe's band finished, another band came on, which I don't remember the name of. Anyway, they were pretty talented guys, but their music was contrived and uninspired. You know, radio-friendly pop that the crowd could easily wrap their heads around. Close to the end of the set, they played a cover of Flogging Molly's "What's Left of the Flag to Me". The singer's indifferent attempt to make it a happy tune that the crowd could get into appalled me. This was the catalyst that pushed us to leave. This made me think my main point of tonight: Must everything I love be destroyed, right in front of my eyes? Do I have to watch while every single thing I hold dear degenerates? Can I change it? Is is my fault? It isn't only music, it is everything. In my experience, change around me is almost never a positive thing. Every day I get a little more appalled by what happens around me. I don't want to be hardened, I want to approach each new experience innocently, untainted from life's disappointments. I don't want folk-punk to be turned into pop. This is just a example of everything that happens. Whenever it seems that I have something good going, that I have done something right for once, it melts away between my fingers, and I am left feeling like I didn't personally do enough to stop it. I think it isn't my fault, but it doesn't stop the massive guilt and regret I feel.   Not just looking at the big picture, but in personal relationships. Over time, I ruin or already have ruined my relationship with pretty much every person I know. Shit goes south quite fast around me, I can't help it. When I talk to people, I never say what I really want to say because I am afraid that I will hurt their feelings, or tip my hand as to how I actually feel about things. I usually play my cards close, for no reason other than because I want to. As a result, I suffer. I'm finished with that. I will no longer be indecisive. I might ruin things faster, but at least I can feel right about ruining it.  From now on, I'm not going to dance around and hint at what I truly mean. I've ran out of time to fuck around, and now I'm going to be a selfish cynic, like I've always wanted to. I'm not personally responsible for each failure around me, and I'm going to stop holding myself accountable, right now. I'm going to say I dislike the things I dislike. I'm going to say I like the things I like. I'm sick of all this teenage politics bullshit, and I'm abolishing it. We are all people, not jocks/preps/stoners/skaters/punks/goths/whatever. I'm not going to fall victim to stereotypes. It happened today, and it made me sick. Today, at Battle of the Bands, you could see how much the different subcultures looked down on each other. I do it, everyone does it. Is a little unity too much too ask? We all suffer from the same problems, we just deal with them in different ways.   I can see the end of our energy. We are almost done being kids and I am not going to let being older and more mature dampen how I feel about people and the world. I'm going to keep my sense of urgency and hope, keep having problems sitting still, keep  believing , because in the end I always win and I know it. I  refuse  to let our creativity die, and I'll be damned before I see everyone I know desend into apathy. I won't become jaded, because if you work at it you  can  change how shit turns out.  That felt very cathartic. Thank you for reading it.

      July, now.  Me and John worked today for a while, then came home. I got my hair cut, which I do not like at all. I returned to a modified version of last summer's mohawk. Not as cool, but more convenient. After that I repaired to Johns house to tinker with my iPod.  After a lot of waiting, and frustration, we managed to load 600-ish songs on to it. The majority of the songs have yet to be put on it, as it got too late and I went home. I left my CDs with John to load on iTunes, though.   I love it. I'm going to bring it everywhere.  Tomorrow is Battle of the Bands, in which I expect to see the usual locals  (Friendly C, Feedback, the Newmans, etc, etc.) But the  real  reason I am going is to see Schilling's band stumble through some All-American Rejects and Something Corporate covers. I can't imagine a funnier afternoon than that.  On the DQ: like John said, it isn't such a bad place to work, especially if you hit the Dairy Jackpot and get to work with Lewis. The  majority  of the people there are on drugs, be it just pot, like Jim and others, or meth, like Shelby. Pretty much all the other workers have to bail once my grandma makes them get a drug test. It is kind of sad, working with a bunch of teenage burnouts who have no purpose other than getting high. But my mom is the worst. She is crazy, just like I claim, but everyone ignores me. Well, when she knifes someone (probably me), I'll say "I told you so," unless she manages to kill me, in which case it will be my epitaph.  Hobe got an iPod also. He also commented on the blog. God forbid that he actually blog, because that would be waaaay too mind-blowing.  Sadly, I have to work on Sunday, so I won't get a chance to march with the BACP. I will make the fireworks at night, however.   Were I a conservative, I would sabotage the BACP by marching with them and giving the Hitler salute to fellow liberals. Now, I know that wasn't PC, but it made me laugh pretty hard.   In other news, Bill Cosby ranted about the black community today (again). If you ever saw  The Cosby Show  back in the day, you'd know why I find this funny. Just watching Bill Cosby  talk  is hilarious, and seeing him complain about what is wrong with kids today would've killed me.  I'm tired, good night.

      Ok, working at the DQ is quite an interesting experience. I get to hang out with all the stoners and retards that Garrison can throw at me. Even though most of the employees suck, there are a few that are very cool. Following the Chain of Command: first, on top of the visible food chain, there is Nancy. She owns the place along with Rick. A very nice lady, even though she does have some crazy ideas (like me fighting with Sandy for the break-till). Then there is Lazy Louis. Here's a guy who tells us about his run ins with the Federalis in Mexico. Who knows what would happen if Nancy made  him  take a drug test. After Louis, we have the real brains of the DQ: Sandy. Actually, Sandy is not only the brains, she is also the brawn. With her fearsome gaze that has been known to turn people to stone, she strikes fear into the heart of all. After Sandy is Janelle. Janelle scares me. She likes to do work a lot. Following Janelle there is Eric. Eric is probably the coolest kid (besides Josh and I) that works there. Following Eric it is Josh and myself. After us, the employees go to shit for the most part. Some of them are ok, but most of them are just crazy girls who cant do anything right and do way to many drugs. Those are the employees in a nutshell.  As Josh mentioned, I saw Spiderman 2 at the 12:01 showing. It was a little better than the first one. Too bad Bruce Campbell wasn't Doctor Octavius. It would have been immensly better if he had. We can only hope that Spiderman 3 has  two  bad guys.  In other Brainerd news, Battle of the Bands is tomorrow. Although I am going there with the expectation that most of the bands will suck, I am still going. I want to go there to see people I know playing, like Schilling, if his band made it. Schilling playing a Bass... What a funny thought. If Schillings band is there, I am going to throw many somethings at them because they will suck, badly. Joe Day and the Normans (???) may also be there. I know that at the end of school Joe was talking about being in Battle of the Bands.   The Fourth of July is on Sunday, and I have to work. I have to work from nine to four. Hopefully, I can find a relatively easy job to do. After work, I'm gonna go to the fireworks. Good plan.

      Admittedly, the BACP took the coffins out out of respect for families of servicemembers currently in Iraq. I mean, i see your point - what better way to celebrate than be heavily reminded that your loved one could die any second over there? Bring on the fear.  Also... freedom is not free, whether it's Americans' freedom or Iraqis' freedom. We're all citizens in this global community. You said it makes you sick to see the dead children and civilians. Let's realize that Saddam Hussein was even worse...  Furthermore, servicemen *also their families* should not complain about this war. If they had been drafted involuntarily, it would be entirely different, but signing up for the armed services means pledging yourself to following the leader. You get many beneifts, but it's not meant to be a FREE RIDE as many take it to be. There's a reason you get such a big deal, and that's because you've signed up to possibly be called to put your life on the line.   I don't know why Bush had to invade looking for "weapons of mass destruction." Why couldn't Hussein just be kicked out for being evil? The UN seems like a bunch of BS to me right now. I hope to get a view of the European perspective whilst I visit.

      okay, i came back because i found out I had to work today and tomorrow, so my personal camping trip is cut to about, um, 16 hours. so if anything is going on, please notify this guy. I've got a burning in myself that only a lot of Halo can quench. But I smell like smoke and gotta shower and go to work. No pun intended on that smell like smoke bit. I really do. It's not bad, to tell you the truth. Also I went to Famous Dave's yesterday for supper and Ashley Grunewald and Mike Giese were there. They cut us short some cornbread and baked beans. It wasn't cool.  Let's do some Halo tonite or tomorrow nite! Tuesday night works too.

      Tonight, the blog has been updated with a new name, and a more aesthetically pleasing look.   I watched a little  Pulp Fiction  a while ago. It was funny to see all the curse words changed to 'clown,' but it just wasn't as entertaining as watching the non-TV version. So, here I am.  Tomorrow, I'll probably head up to the Oselands. Chris just got off work a little while ago, and I am suprised that he didn't call.   Last night I stayed at Bryce's. We played some Halo, sat around, and I went to bed early (2:30 am) because I had to get up early to work that morning. I was woken up around noon by Gravity Beam dropping his toy crayon on my face, wanting me to throw it, and that damn ferret crawling all over me like I was some kind of jungle gym for her personal amusement. Well, I'm not, especially when I am sleeping. When I left, Dale was sleeping in an armchair in the same position as when I arrived, 17 hours earlier.  Top news today: Rick James, famous Super Freak and freebaser, has bought the farm. Now, I hope the horrible Chappelle's Show imitators will stop with their jokes for good. I don't know if they think parroting things that happened a year ago on the show over and over and over is  funny , or if they just hate everyone.   Some guy is claiming that Ireland is the Lost City of Atlantis. Personally, I believe that that Atlantis was a MacGuffin (is it proper to use that term when referring to writings, also?) to move two of Plato's dialogues forward (I can't remember which, but I am not exactly a scholar).  I bought some new CDs yesterday. One was Bad Religion's  Suffer , one of the five most influential albums on modern punk rock. Of course, it is no  No Control , although everybody probably disagrees with me on that. I needed to replace my old copy, which I lost approximately six months ago. The other, the Dead Kennedy's  Bedtime for Democracy , was an impulse buy. I had been trying to trade for Chris's vinyl version for a few weeks, and decided that "Take This Job and Shove It" was a perfect fit for a post-work Thursday. Not that I don't marginally enjoy my job, but I oppose work on general principle.  I slept on my belt last night. It has some metal that I am allergic to, and now I have this weird rash all over my stomach that itches. It sucks.   Since I moved into the future with my iPod, I think that it is time for a new mix CD. By mix CD I mean iPod playlist. I'll have to get working on that and post it in a few days. Unlike John, who foolishly slaps his favorite songs from each band together, my playlists are a work of art. Each is carefully crafted with different sounds and genres to elict a wide array of emotions. A playlist is like a puzzle, and I enjoy fitting the pieces of reggae and hardcore together.  Well, I am going to take a shower. I hope you enjoy the minor changes.  Gute nacht.

      I'm going camping for the weekend, so I'll be gone a bit.  I just realized today that relevant discussion was happening in the comments, which I didn't read until this morning...  I'm sorry if you ever thought I was putting down "punk." Truly, through my whole life, it's carried with it a negative connotation. Now, it's a loaded word, one I won't use to myself in the dark of night. My apologies.  I tried to look up this Nazi war crimes/Vatican connection, but I'm just confused. Certainly, there was some help from the Catholic church to the Nazis. Hitler was a self-proclaimed Catholic, and numbers of extremely radical Catholics, i.e. Fr. Coughlin, were in the same field as he, surely including bishops and others present in the Vatican. This is not to mention that Italy was under Nazi control at the time and all present were under great duress. This does not connect all of the church and the heirarchy of the Pope directly to the Nazi cause, however. If you could, I'd enjoy a look at your sources so I can discern a bit for myself.  I don't hate Fundamentalists, or anyone for that matter. But their point of view is not my own.  As a matter of fact, Catholic canon prohibits use of birth control outside of Natural Family Planning, as stated in Pope Paul VI's  Humanae Vitae , published in the early 60s to great uproar. Sex can happen without birth control; it's this culture that says it cannot. The Catholic view of the family provides for two equal and primary functions thereof; love and procreation, along with duties of education and morality associated with offspring. Both these are present in sexual intercourse, at least that which is without perversion thereof. Sex without babies (birth control, abortion) is wrong, as is babies without sex (in-vitro fertilization, cloning). The only "birth control" allowed is NFP, which leaves the act fully intact without addition of barriers or drugs, but also provides for the need of a family to not bring into the world another child, which may burden the family financially or otherwise.  This radio thing sounds like fun, but I'm not sure how it would work to broadcast if we're in school all day.  Sorry if I missed anything, please post here for any questions. I hope to be back Monday.  God bless.

        In its early years of existence, Planned Parenthood limited itself to contraception and specifically opposed abortion. The following is a quote from an official Planned Parenthood pamphlet :    "Is birth control an abortion?" "Definitely not. An abortion kills the life of a baby after it has begun. It is dangerous to your life and health. It may make you sterile so that when you want a child you cannot have it. Birth control merely post-pones the beginning of life." Currently, the number of abortions Planned Parenthood does increases each year as it converts more of its clinics to killing centers. In 1985 it had 51 chambers which killed 110,000. By 1994 it had 70 which killed 134,000. Every year, it refers to other facilities almost as many abortions as it does itself. Planned Parenthood has even promoted a pro-abortion "comic book," geared for teenagers, entitled Abortion Eve. On the back cover is a caricature of the "Assumption of the Blessed Virgin" depicting a pregnant Mary with the idiot face of Mad magazine’s Alfred E. Neumann. The caption says, "What, me worry?" One Planned Parenthood pamphlet even goes so far as to state:  "In every generation there exists a group of people so filled with bigotry and self-righteousness that they will resort to any means — even violence — to impose their views on society. Today, such fanatics dominate a movement ironically called ‘the Right-to-Life,’ a movement which threatens the most basic of all human rights."  As a matter of fact, Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Focusing originally on birth control, as noted, it moved its platform to abortion as the trade became more lucrative. Supposedly focusing on prevention of pregnancy, Planned Parenthood is in an uproar over parental notification laws. Take, for example our own state. The State of Minnesota had such a law in place since 1981. Then the law was challenged in court and suspended in March 1986. The Supreme Court later ruled that the law was constitutional, and it was reimposed. There were excellent records kept for several years with the law in place, several more with-out the law, and then again with the law. Results were very clear.  Perhaps not unexpectedly, the number of abortions to unemancipated minors dropped, and by a figure of 34%. Correspondingly, the number of live births to this group increased. The unexpected result was that the number of  pregnancies  in this age group to unmarried girls decreased by 27%. This is an unprecedented amount, more of a decrease than any other preventive measure previously attempted. I mean, we're all about making abortions RARE, but available, correct? Even Mr. Kerry states this, and I'm assuming DJ Wang stands the same. But is Planned Parenthood pleased? Not at all. In fact, they brought the lawsuit which suspended the law. Planned Parenthood has constantly been telling the world that it wants to reduce teen pregnancies. Here was an outstanding example of an effective method, and Planned Parenthood showed its true stripes. It went to court to stop the only major successful program that limited teen pregnancies. So much for Planned Parenthood’s claims that it wants to reduce teen pregnancies.  Now for some fun facts:  PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS NOT DECREASED THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS TO UNWED TEENAGERS. The number of births to unmarried mothers hit a record high of 1,165,384 in 1990. That was up 7% in one year and 75% over the decade. Nat'l Center for Health Statistics, June '92. This is after two decades of Planned Parenthood's sex education. PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS NOT DECREASED THE DEMAND FOR ABORTION. After years of Planned Parenthood programs, legal abortions have increases 101.6% since abortion became legal. According to their own reports, Planned Parenthood itself performs almost 10% of all abortions in the U.S. PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS IN THE ABORTION BUSINESS. Planned Parenthood performed 129,000 abortions in 1991. Compare this to fewer than 5,000 referrals for adoptions, and only 7,000 cases of prenatal care. 1991 Annual Planned Parenthood Federation. This means that less than 10 percent of the services performed for pregnant women at Planned Parenthood have to do with non-abortion services. Planned Parenthood promotes itself as "privately funded". Yet, in 1991 alone they received $124,000,000 of taxpayer dollars in government funds.  Don't argue against parental notification, either... Not old enough to go to war, not old enough to drink, nor vote, not considered a legal adult; a person should not be allowed to have a life-threatening operation done on them without parental knowledge.  That's all I have for now.

      A few days ago, Chris launched a webcomic on Geocities. Now, it is rather funny because his comics are rambling, incoherent, and offensive, just like Chris. He takes things from ska and punk culture, and a few inside jokes, and slams them together in one poorly drawn menagerie of curse words and Mustard Plug references. Anyway, I'd thought I would post one.  (Edit: I took it down because it was messing up the sidebar.)  In case you haven't heard, I am the greatest MS Paint artist to ever walk the planet. Unfortunately, one night someone accidentely deleted my four years of random Paint riffing. I think I will get into that again, due to Chris's unintentionally hilarious comics inspiring me.  If you want to check out some more, you can find Spelunker Comix urlLink  here.  Be warned: the other kid's comics are not funny at all. They are as boring and pointless as the kid who drew them. This kid is named Michael. Now I have only have met this kid once, but he annoys me so much that I have trouble describing it. First of all, he is an extremely spoiled rich kid who plays video games all day long. He thinks that he is the greatest Halo player to ever walk the earth. One day, I was over at the Oselands when he came over. He started talking trash about Halo. Me and Chris didn't really care, and just blew him off. Finally, after a hour and a half of his taunting, we agreed to play. Needless to say, we killed him. The only time he would get a kill would be stealing one from one of us. He started throwing a fit. It was quite funny. Finally he said, "When Halo 2 comes out, I will kick your ass, because there will be no pistols." I don't usually use this word, but then I called him the biggest nerd I've ever met, for obsessing his victories over me in a video game that won't come out for months. After my admonitions for being such a jerk, he left the room in a huff with Chris and Erik agreed with me that this kid was a grade A scumbag.  Our medallion hunt didn't go so well today. Tomorrow, there will be a significant clue, but people will have had three hours to look it over by the time we get it. Still, hopes are high. That thousand dollars will float our pirate radio station, of which we are still determining the name. The radio station is looking better every day. I have ideas to take requests, have guest DJ iPodders, advertise surreptiously in BHS, and perhaps have liberal/conservative point/counterpoint. Wouldn't that be fun?  Well, I'm going to doodle. I'll see ya tomorrow.

      Also, I don't see why people do have to control themselves if they don't want to. Not that they shouldn't, but if they don't, who is going to stop them? Unless ol' Georgie suddenly whips out the "No Personal Contact Unless You're Married" ammendment I don't think the NPCA (No Personal Contact Agency) is going to start enforcing (or even exist for that matter) this rule. Although, that would be funny. I can see Dubya trying to explain it in one of the debates. There he is, squinty eyes and all, looking like he is staring into the sun and all the while he has that stupid grin... and then his ears start wiggling when he (thinks he) gets something right. "Ummmmm... this new ammendement of mine... is meant to... ummm... stop personel contact unless your [intentional] married with someone of the opuesta, as the spanish say,  sex (by this time, they have passed the same sex amendment). We think... ummm... Damn, I forgot what Dick told me to say... Damn, I can't believe that I just ummm... said that... Oh yeah, we think that it will stop people from... I didn't inhale... Damn... Bill got off on that..."

      About Sanger, no one really cares. The only reason she was ever brought up was to show that a conservative person would say someone was a whore simply for inventing birth control. Albeit, it may be true but they did not know that when they made the statement so it doesn't matter.  Now, what's wrong with Planned Parenthood? It is a nonprofit organization that helps people. It is definately not the same organization that Sanger created. If you want to dig up dirt on groups that have no relevancy today, lets look at the Catholic Church. For example: the crusades. How many people died simply so the Pope could try to get rich? I'm pretty sure that more people died there than Sanger and Planned Parenthood could have ever managed to kill. Now you may say she actually has "killed" a lot more, that is debatable though while the deaths of the Crusades are pretty concrete. By pretty I mean definately.

      Margaret Sanger: Not only did she favor abortion, but she proposed forced sterilization for those whom she considered unfit to reproduce. She worked hard for a "race of thoroughbreds" until Hitler’s similar "Master Race" made that goal unpopular. She was a true eugenicist. For example, her April 1933 Birth Control Review, devoted an entire edition to eugenic sterilization. Whom did she consider unfit? Black people, Jews, Southern European immigrants (especially Italians), but also others of "low I.Q." These "feebleminded" people were a "menace to the race." Margaret Sanger, the famous founder of Planned Parenthood, was supportive. She wanted "more children from the fit, less from the unfit." This wasn’t only related to contraceptive planning. A seditor, she printed grossly eugenic material, approving of Hitler’s sterilization program (see Into the Darkness, Nazi Germany Today, by L. Stoddard, p. 196). She believed that "Negroes and Southern Europeans were mentally inferior to native born Americans." She found these people, Hebrews, and others "feebleminded," "human weeds," and called them a "menace to the race." In 1933, her Birth Control Review devoted an entire edition to eugenic sterilization. Sanger’s famous "Plan for Peace" was almost the same as Hitler’s, even going beyond it to suggest, in essence, concentration camps. "When the world realized the logical consequences of Hitler’s hereditarian-eugenic, totalitarian type of government, Margaret Sanger’s birth-control movement had to take a quick step away from its overt eugenic language."Let us quote from her "Plan for Peace." This was little more than peaceful genocide. She wanted the United States: - "To keep the doors of immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as the feebleminded as determined by Stanford-Binet I.Q. tests. - "To apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring. - "To insure the country against future burdens of maintenance for numerous offspring as may be born of feeble-minded parents by pensioning all persons with transmissible diseases who voluntarily consent to sterilization. - "To give dysgenic groups in our population their choice of segregation or sterilization. - "To apportion farm lands and homesteads for these segregated persons where they would be taught to work under competent instructors for a period of their entire lives. [Practically speaking, a concentration camp.] - "[To] take an inventory of the secondary group such as illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes, dope fiends; classify them in special departments under government medical protection, and segregate them on farms and open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and development of moral conduct." (Again, concentration camps.) She said, "The most merciful thing a large family can do for one of its infant members is to kill it."  Furthermore, there are alternative methods of birth control. NFP leaves the act intact while reducing the risk of pregnancy moreso than condoms. It also has no side effects present in the pill or other medicines that attack and pervert a woman's hormones.  The great thing about this country, obviously, is that everyone can be sexually promiscuous without repercussion or responsibility, since we're all just animals anyway. The only difference is that we animals go to "colledge," so we oughta be able to control us selves. But a little self-control? Whoa, obviously the Founding Fathers never intended that to happen. AMERICA: self-control optional. It was actually on the last page of the Constitution, but it got lost in the fire at the White House in the war of 1812.  See ya.

      Yesterday it was revealed that the intellegence behind the terror threat in New York was over three years old. Now, I don't want to call this a vile tactic to take some of the post-DNC press coverage away from John Kerry, but that is what it was. To raise the so-called "terror level" to a ominous orange over intelligence that predated 9/11 is ludicrous. This isn't the first time in recent memory that the Bush administration has been playing politics either. They instructed the Pakistani government that from July 28-30 would be the best time to announce the capture of a terror suspect, even though he had been captured a week earlier. Oddly enough, those dates seem to coincide with the Democratic National Convention.  I think we are all sick of living in a culture of fear. I know that terroristic threats and information have to be taken seriously, especially in this post-9/11 world, but I also believe that the capabilities of terrorists have been grossly overstated. Think about it: even though the Bush administration has waged a horribly ineffective War of Terror, they have made it a top issue that many more countries and people seriously pursue. We now think about terrorism in every aspect of our lives. Chances are, we won't be caught with our pants down again. Truth of the matter is, many of these "terror alerts" are designed to keep Americans afraid. When we are afraid, we won't look too closely at what the government instructs, and we will readily give up some of our civil liberties in the name of "freedom."  We aren't safer than we were four years ago. George has fostered so much ill-will in the Islamic world that every day, more jihadis plot to destroy us. Attacking Iraq sure hasn't helped us out in the Middle East, and neither will attacking Syria or Iran. We need to work together, and become part of the global community again. We need to show the world that we aren't all arrogant oilmen who are unilaterally committed to the dollar.  It is time to try some compassion, damnit. We've tried things his way, and now it is proven that "Shock and Awe" is not good foreign policy.  I am thinking about submitting this as an Open Forum letter to the  Dispatch , and I'd like your input. It has to be under 300 words, so I'd probably have to cut some things out of it. Please look for spelling and grammar mistakes, also. Thank you.  In other news: Work today. It went by pretty fast, and my grandma gave me an office chair that is much more comfortable than my old chair. I got paid, bought some gas, and now, here I am.   Today it was pleasantly cool, and tomorrow I hope it is sunny out so I can go swimming.  Me and John are thinking about going in halfsies on a FM transmitter with a mile radius, so we could start a radio station off our iPods at the high school. We could take requests and whatnot, and having a pirate radio station has always been a dream of mine. You know, sticking it to the man and whatnot.   Speaking of John... he got into a funny fight with his brother today. He demanded money to pick Mike up, and Mike threw his shoe at him. John drove away, but turned around for a while. As he was turning around to pick Mike up, Mike called and told him to "suck on his nuts." Now, while that is quite disgusting, John broke the code by telling his mother. You  never  tell on a sibling, unless it is something that won't get them in trouble. I am a devout follower of the code, and although Bailey has done some scummy things to me in the past, I never told Mom (Unless I was trying to cause trouble over something small).  Well, I am going to play my guitar and enjoy the night air.  Until tomorrow.

      Hello.  There has been some interesting discussions 'round the blog these past few days. I'd like to invite those who read/post at the blog to participate in them.  Well, today was quite mild. I cleaned my room, which took a few hours. Then I ventured over to Bridge of Harmony to buy some picks. Unfortunately, the staff there were being complete dicks, taking order after order while I was ignored. Finally, they rung up my beloved Fender Thins, which were a little overpriced at $4.25. It seems that every time I go there, the staff do their best to alienate me. I always get ignored, it takes forever for them to ring up something as simple as a string, and the senior associates yell at me. One time me and Chris were in there looking at basses and this guy said, "If you aren't buying, get out." Now we had been in the store for 5 minutes, and had just started to look at the basses. Obviously buying a musical instrument is a slow process, as you want to find something you are comfortable with and sounds nice. Chris isn't just going to drop 700 dollars without carefully looking over the bass. So we decided that our next instruments wouldn't be coming from there. Long story short, those guys are jerks.  Later on I played some video games, read  On the Road , and watched Jon Stewart make a Texas Congressman squirm. He was a member of the GOP "War Room" in Boston, and Jon nailed him when he started talking about John Kerry being ranked the most liberal member of the Senate. It was quite funny because he set him up for it throughout the course of the interview, and at the end you could tell that he was serious about what he was saying. I enjoy the Daily Show, and though they lampoon both left and right, it seems to be more than a little liberal to me. Heck, one of the co-creators has a radio show on Air America. Usually, they are pretty gentle about it, and they don't coddle the left either. I've watched the Daily Show sporadically for a few years, but I watch it about every night now.  Instead of blogging a lot last night, I sat down at wrote down what I was thinking on the back of some tabs. It was basically the same thing I blogged, but it was nice to actually write something instead of typing. Also, I enjoy looking at my handwriting. It has evolved from a harsh, angular, unreadable scribble to a soothing, flowing unreadable scribble.   I get paid tomorrow, which is cool. I don't have a plan yet on exactly what to squander my money on, but no doubt by 4:30 tomorrow it will be gone.   Tomorrow I think I might check out a movie, either the Village or the Bourne Supremacy. I'm leaning towards the Bourne Supremacy, because M. Night Shylaman is more than a little full of himself. But hey, so is Quentin Tarantino, and he makes great movies. Go figure.  Well, I'm not really out of things I want to say but I'll save them for tomorrow.  Fall asleep fast, because waking up early is the worst.

      Now, first off, Sanger may have been a "whore," but when Hobie made his comment all he knew was that she invented birth control and therefore she was such. He more than likely did not go home and research that about Sanger and made his comment solely based on her invention.  Now, as you said, the feminist movement was essentially an attempt to make men and women more equal. And as you said, one of the ways they were made more equal was when it came to sexual promiscuity. One of the great things about this country though, is that everyone one is guaranteed equality of opportunity. If half the population can be sexually promiscuit [?], why can't the other half? Also, not just people who are sexuall promiscuit [?] use birth control. There could be a thousand other reasons why they do. Perhaps a young, married couple aren't financially ready to have children. What should they do? Have 5 kids and then go on welfare and not go to colledge and be stuck in the underclass for the rest of their life? They could use their birth control and get through colledge and not be a drag on society.

       Oh, it's happened. Shortly after one Margaret Sanger was called a whore by my very slightly overreacting pal Jetpack, Mattson slammed the statement, saying "it was the most catholic thing ever" with obvious distaste. Being, as I was, there, I took immediate offense but kept my mouth shut.      Turns out the Hobster wasn't too far off. This woman is a bit worse than anyone expected. She herself was highly promiscuous and had many lovers. She favored "free love" for women without any sexual limits but without the burden of children. She saw "the marriage bed [as] the most degenerating influence in the social order."      She was a overriding feminist. My two cents on feminism:   the movement, along with birth control and abortion, come about as a liberal attempt to give women the ability to be as sexually promiscuous and relatively irresponsible as the men they couple with. It calls to mind "Harrison Bergeron," but with a separate twist. Everything possible is done to make everyone as similar as possible. Believe it or not, men and women are different! Realistically, all men are  not  created equal; this is the logic behind affirmative action, which I personally support. Since, like the lady with the shotgun in that short story (can't remember her title), we cannot easily limit the male ability of promiscuity without consequence, we must therefore instate the ability in women as well, since two wrongs happen to make a right in this case. Unless, of course, we argue that sexual promiscuity is not wrong...      Feel free to challenge me down that deadend road.      We are survivors, gentlemen. 1/3 of our generation has been destroyed as a result of "the right to privacy." A potential best friend to any of us is dead in the name of Choice.       I'll be praying for you.

      Good evening. Let me start out with my customary complaints about the heat.  My house is too hot. I can't sleep.   Yesterday I went over to the Oselands. There were at least 400 tourists staying at their house, so we elected to sleep out in the Garage. Me, Chris, and Erik sat ourselves down in front of the TV after a day of swimming for some video games and arguments on the nature of music. Today we spent a few hours cleaning out my car. Chris did most of the work because most of the garbage was his.   Unfortunately, I didn't get enough sleep the last two nights because I wasn't at home, where I am the only one in the house, and I have peace and quiet. I'm really at a loss for what to type.  Basically, all I have been thinking about today is how tired I am. I'd really like to put something more interesting down, but I won't.

      Now time for a fun-filled parody; please don't take more offense than was originally dealt in the passage...  It has been a while, but I've been at Steubenville North. On Sunday I went to Mass with Archbishop Flynn. I wanna go crash so here is the abridged version: Steve Agrisano and Father Stan killed disbelief, SONAR, Matt Smith, and APeX were good, and Jesus Christ personally rocked each and every of the 2,100 who attended. Some people got a lot of stuff signed, and I got one really good book for dealing with anti-Catholic Fundamentalists, whom I'll put up with some other time.  Yesterday, I went swimming in the grace of the Holy Spirit and blew my chances of returning to the Devil's world.  Today, return home. I've been drifting around since I got home, not really willing to go anywhere but still searching for something to deepen my spirituality. I settled on an hour or two of chatting with some friends about an exorcistic (sic) experience and reading about all of the trials and tribulations of my brothers in Christ on this blog.  I am thinking about forming some serious plans for the rest of my life, though. I don't really have any money so I'll probably pray to God for discernment of my vocation and hang out.  Not much new in the world today. Important sinners are badmouthing God on MTV, the weak people of the world are responding with the usual half-efforts and turns from the Truth, and the 12 "undecided" in whether God is real and worth it make plans to move to Hell.  (lets hope they will turn to Jesus for the eternal salvation he offers all of us)  Well, Christ has now forgiven the hellish sins out of me. I have many plans, and I am no longer content to while away the rest of the summer in obscurity, I hopefully won't. I could've did some things differently, but too late for that now, so why second-guess myself? Why am I speaking of my life like it is already over? Adulthood hasn't even started yet, and I celebrate the end of my sin after every reconciliation.  I kind of want to see Godspell and The Passion of the Christ. By which I kind of want to see I mean I will if there is nothing better to do. Now that I think of it, I thank God for today. Tomorrow, I also could read these books I bought. I've got 2-3 waiting to be read. Anyway, I can't say I am interested in blogging at the moment.  See ya next time I feel like it.  Even though I'm not really interested in blogging, I continue to do so. I've experienced a profound surrender in my life at the Steubenville North Youth Conference, and I hope everyone is open to my sharing of the wonderful love and state of grace I am living in right now.  For God so loved the world that he gave His  only son , that we might not perish, but have life eternal. May the peace of our Lord and Savior be with all of you. Good night and God bless.
