      Hi.....looky thals I'm using your blogger thingy-magig.  I wrote comments to two of your posts now i'm putting in my own message, aren't you proud?  So, whats up with Tammy?  Well I'm glad you asked.  My arm muscles hurt.  I was helping a friend move yesterday for 6 hours.  kinda sucked my ass.  but they fed me pizza, so it was cool.  I lifted more than the men cause they were wimps and just wanted to play video game.....what loosers (I say as I spend my free time writing down what happend to me yesterday on a computer.....oh well, my mom thinks I'm cool) Oh and there was this guy who reminded me of my 14 year old brother only he was 19.  He thinks he's part cat and often meows loudly. At our first meeting he repeatedly rammed his head into an elevator door and burped real loud....charming fellow.  and there was this other guy who reminded me of robert (my 19 year old brother)  He was scruffy and had the drug addict look, Erika would have found him attractive.  but I think he was trying to hit on me.  Me and Vicky (the girl I was helping move) were talking about Olando Bloom *swoon*  and she was getting all it and mentioned something about tying him up with a silk scarf.  and I made the comment nothing wrong with a little bondage.  then later when me and his guy were in the elevator, he was like " so, about that comment you made earlier, you like bondage?"    they he began to ask me if I was single and how he picks up girls and how he was in the market for a girlfriend, and I wanted to throw up and tell him how creepy this all was because he reminded me of my brother, but I didnt' want to hurt his feelings so I just took the stairs.  Then I was talking to vicky and she was telling me that he was slightly autistic, but not like normal autism.....its just like he's mentally imature.  he's 23 but he acts like a 15 year old, then I felt bad for almost throwing up. O.k, well I have to go to work *grumbles incoherently* so I'll catch y'all on the flip side.  Oh yeah, hi Tracy, Nikol (sp?)and anyone else who is on this server whom I haven't met.  Tootals :)

I need a "remote server".  Yikes to that.  And listen to your mother, Thalia.  You are the coolest thing since  urlLink iced tea

      These are probably really old, but I enjoyed them.  http://www.rumdesign.com/wrong I don't know if the slash after wrong matters.  http://www.chriselkins.com/insane1.htm  http://www.phobos-deimos.com/Humor/stare%202.htm I braced for this one so it wasn't as cool.   I don't care if nobody likes them.  My mom thinks I'm cool.    Nikol.  I think you're crazy!  You are not gaining weight!!  (probably not the best thing to say) But even if you are, you'd still be hot.  I've seen you chunky.  You'd still have the same appeal.

      Thalia, I have to tell you that I am waggling my finger at you.  I think I am gaining weight right now and I sure hate it.  Thing is, you have a very very very very very nice body.  You need to stand yourself in front of the mirror a few more times.

      Let's see.  Today I had a 7'45 am workout scheduled.  It kinda happened.  I'm not to enthusiatic about this quest for a thinner me.  Not that I'm partial to my back fat or anything.  It's just too hard!!  If there were no thai restaurants or cinnamon candies or sausage mcgriddles at Mcdonalds or pepperoni pizzas from Pizza Hut, I'd be thin.  And perhaps if my mom's side of the family didn't resemble hippos.  Those are the things keeping me fat!!!  I have to get away from them.  Well, away from everything but the Thai food and the cinnamon candies.  And my mom's side of the family.  I'm eating  one of those vegetable medley thingys.  It has broccoli, baby carrots and cauliflower.  Mmm mm good.   I wonder if my breath smells as bad as my tongue tastes.  All the people I must be offending right now.  Oh well.  But that's all.  I have a mental issue and I just wanted to share it with the one other person who reads this, Nikol.  Seeing as how none of my other friends can take time out of their busy schedules to look at it, Tammy, Tracy, Robin, Mike, Frank.

      I have absolutely nothing going on for the better part of the day. You know, working and all. I'm going to Nikol's tonight to help her move and to hangout.  I wonder if that's supposed to be two words -'hangout'.  But that's all. And there are bills to be paid.  Yea bills!!

      I have realized today that I need a new job.  It's not that I hate my job, I just don't like it much.  I mean, I get paid to sit and walk.  Things that I would normally do at a job, but in conjunction with a shit load of other stuff.  Well, I do answer phones.  I actually hate that part of the job.  Between 4 and 7 that damn thing never stops.  Today was horrible though, I took one hit off my cigarette before it burned out because so many fucking people were calling.  I s'pose that's what I'm here for.  But some days I don't want to be.  I think I might just move to Nevada and whore.  (I wonder if Mike has read this recently.) Just kidding.  Not that I think it's wrong, I just don't think it's right for me.   I have decided to find a sugar daddy, but not an old one.  But not a young one.  Middle aged would be good.  He has to be tall at least 5'10, I have an issue with height.  He can't be skinny.  I don't like skinny people, as a matter of fact I hate them!!!  I just want to kidnap them and force feed them cheddarwursts and macaroni and cheese.  (I wonder if she knows I'm talking about her...)  But that would be cruel.  Sorry.   I don't want a sugar daddy anymore.   There's this cute guy that works at the building that I protect.  There's always a cute guy in my life.  One that I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever speak to.  Because I'm retarded.  I have this thing...Sometimes I don't care what people think of me, especially guys.  It's that whole "share my life take me for what I am, cause I'll never change all my colors for you...", but then when there is a guy I'm interested in I just assume that they have absolutely no interest in me whatsoever, so I don't bother trying.  I don't bother holding conversations, I don't laugh when they do things that I think they think are funny, even if they are funny cause I just assume that didn't do them to make me laugh.  I think that's sad.  Oh well!!!  I don't like dating anyway.  And I don't like sex either.  That's funny.   I have nothing more to say.

      There is absolutely nothing going on in my life today.  My tumor is better Nikol.  I danced at the cafe and I was only in a little pain the next day.  Oh, there's this show called Dead Like Me.  Its the greatest show I've seen in a long time.  It's on DVD, Season's 1-3.  But season 1 is only the pilot.  That wasn't cool.  But I know your DVD player isn't hooked up, but if they have it on vhs you should watch it.  There's a lot of swearing and dark humor, it's great!!  Okay, that's all for now.

      I have the coolest titles, don't I?  Well, last night I went to Have A Nice Day Cafe (which will be refered to as the cafe from this point).  Had fun.  There was this guy there that looked a lot like ashton kutcher???.  He was cute.  He was getting married and not out looking to fuck someone, but just wanting to mingle.  But he kept getting shot down.  Poor guy.  So, I brought him to my circle o' friends and he danced with us.  He was happy then.  He gave me a kiss on the cheek and thanked me for dancing with him.  It was cool.  I was pretty drunk.  It's cool though.  I've had this change...my friends say I'm growing as a person but...I don't go to clubs looking for attention anymore.  I used to get all dolled up, but now I just throw on some jeans and a tee and a little makeup and hit the road.  It's cool.  I feel good about that.   Today we got a phone call from our friend Nicci.  It's her last day in town and we are going to hang out with her, hopefully.  She's the third in our group to get married.  Crazy people gettin' married all the time like they ain't got no sense.  Oh, I don't mean that.  Whatever makes them happy.  And for the most part they seem to be.  So, yea.  Well, that's all that's happened in the past 24hrs.  I think.  PEACE

      You were born in the falls of winter I was born in the midst of spring with a vengeful streak and fiery temper And you the disposition of a Snow Queen  You were always so soft but spoken I was never the type to walk away in peace You had a weaker side, Did I make you stronger? Why I'd ever doubt your need for me...  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am full of me  So if I decide to compromise And if you understand my point of view When I come round just be on my side And I'll do the same for you  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am full of me  I'm angry and depressed at times And you're crazy and always pressed for time But we're still here, after all those times And we'll be here, And we'll be here  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am so full of me  Hope you like it!!

      It really bothers me when people start to put "solvable predicaments" before their friends when they've only been in the freakin' relationship for a week.  I know there's a honeymoon phase, but when someone says, "oh, I'm trying to stop completely ditching you guys when a boy comes in the picture" and then they turn right around and do it again, well it makes me think that they're just a lying asshole.  I know I'm being just a tit harsh, but it happens every fucking time.  And I'm sick of saying -- oh that's just how she is.  Cause people shouldn't ditch people when new people come in their lives unless the old people are bad people and the new people are...unbad people.  There, I think I've said it all.  ERIKA!!!!  Well, maybe I'm just being an asshole.  But what's new.

      There's a great 4 bedroom house right down the street from here for only $700 a month.  It had a porch and a huge yard and pets are allowed.

      It would be nice if you have.  I went to the dentist today cause I had an effing toothache. Now, I feel better. My doctor gave me vicadin. It's not real vicadin, though. The pain just stopped all of a sudden. But it was after Mike made me cry. I asked him to work for me cause I didn't feel great and I didn't want to deal with this place while I was in pain. It only makes it feel more like hell. And I begged him and begged him and he said he'd think about it, but he wasn't serious. I didn't find that out until I called him to ask if he'd decided. Then, I begged and begged some more and he said I can't and I'm hanging up. I was sad then. Not so much now, cause I feel better. But I was then.  The date of the conception of Mike and Heather's quadruplets will be December 13, 2004.  I feel much better now. :P  It's going to cost 700-900 dollars for my root canal. Otherwise I could just get the tooth pulled. But anyone who knows me well knows that I'm just a little too vain for that. It's the 2nd tooth(going back) from my fang. Yes, I have fangs!!  Seen any good porn lately? I haven't. It's funny though. I heard from one of my friends that one of my other friend's husband was mad at her (his wife) because he found out that she was 'entertaining' herself without him. The porn was in a different spot. He went all bitch on her. Like he normally does. I don't understand why guys are that way. Don't they know that if we wanted someone as feminine as us, we'd marry chicks. I don't want a guy who would get angry if I called him a chunky bastard one day. Not that I would call him a chunky bastard. I would if he knew he was chunky. Cause, you know how someone people live in denial. They swear they are still a size 10 just because the button hasn't popped off and clocked Tracy in the eye yet. Hell I've been there.  I want another cigarette.  Ladies when we go camping in August I think we should bring the vodka and the potatoes. VODKA POTATO BASEBALL!!!!!  I'm really looking forward to being away from work. Doing something fun.  I'm officially back to pt August 22. Then I'll have about 2 weeks of freedom. I think I might take the full two weeks off to do absolutely nothing but wallow in self pity. I haven't been able to just dwell on shit that's beyond my control since I started this damn thing.  I have to go do my round, but I'll be back to add on to this blog in an hour or so.  K, I'm back now.  I was thinking that maybe I should buy a dog.  I want a dog.  Dogs are pretty.  I want a mouse too.  A gray one or brown one.  Then, I will make it a little hat and a red and white striped shirt and I will call him gus.  Like Gus-gus from cinderella. One time, when I was in the hospital, my mom's friends bought me a giant stuffed rat.  I called him Gus-gus.   I don't know why I came back.  S'not like I had something to talk about.

      Jackie sucks.&nbsp; She can't give advice.&nbsp; Everytime I ask her for advice she stares at me blankly.&nbsp; I can see the question marks forming in her pupils... I guess it's not so fair that I'm writing this about her knowing that she doesn't read it.&nbsp; But I told her that she sucks at giving advice.&nbsp; So, it's not so bad.&nbsp;  I hate my job.&nbsp; I hate my job.&nbsp; I hate my job.&nbsp; My brother has a job.&nbsp; A good job.&nbsp; Fucker better keep it.&nbsp; We're moving to these apartments in Racine IF I find a good job, either third shift or bartending, and if he keeps his job.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind staying in Racine&nbsp;I guess.&nbsp; I'd rather be in Milwaukee, close to school and bartending.&nbsp; But&nbsp;who cares.  I'm reading this book called ghost hunting to prepare for my first case as a paranormal investigator.&nbsp; So far I've learned that...I've learned stuff.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; Some things I already knew.&nbsp; Good book.  I think that I'm just going to follow through with my original plan.&nbsp; I'll go to gateway and take that responsible drinking class or whatever it is and then I'll just try and get a job around here for a month.&nbsp; Then try and find one in Milwaukee.&nbsp; I just need to be away from this place.&nbsp; For a really long time.  I'm thinking about my bills a lot.&nbsp; Not as much as I used to, it's less stressful now.&nbsp; But I owe a lot of money to a lot of companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pay them their money, but I don't&nbsp;have any.&nbsp; So, I was thinking that maybe I could rob a bank, or fake my death, or sell my ass, or kill people&nbsp;for money.&nbsp; Well, I probably can't do&nbsp;any of that now...well,&nbsp;maybe if I kill all of you...but why would I do that?&nbsp; Nobody's paying me to.  My original plan was to&nbsp;work&nbsp;2 full time jobs...hey there's&nbsp;a cute guy.&nbsp; Just one though...anyway.&nbsp; I would have worked 1st and 2nd, but the stupid 1st shift job wanted me to work the fucking mandatory over time.&nbsp; And I couldn't.&nbsp; Everything would have worked out fine.&nbsp; 6am-2'30pm.&nbsp; Then 3pm-11pm.&nbsp; See, perfect.&nbsp; Now, 2 months later, I'm still poor as hell and struggle more so now than I was then.  I want my mama.&nbsp;  I want extensions.&nbsp; I like my little bit o' hair.&nbsp; But I'd like a longer bit o' hair for now.&nbsp; See how that's out of the question?&nbsp; Sad isn't it?  I need new clothes. Well, maybe not at this exact moment.&nbsp; But SOON I will need new jeans because I will be a size 8 and these size 12's will have to be replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a wish list at american eagle everyone!!&nbsp; Go to  urlLink www.ae.com  and look for my wish list.&nbsp; Wish list is at the top of the page near the end of the list.&nbsp; I'm telling you this like you will buy it for me.&nbsp; Anyway... they ask for a person's first and last name or the email address.&nbsp; My email address is  urlLink celcebeta@mail.com .&nbsp; So go have a look.&nbsp; I have a lot of pink stuff.&nbsp; I ae had more nice shirts.&nbsp; The selection somewhat sucks now.&nbsp;  Well, I'm done.&nbsp; If there are any spelling or grammatical&nbsp;errors, oh well.&nbsp; I don't have to check them.

      I was in a really bad mood earlier today.&nbsp; I think it has something to do&nbsp;with PMS.&nbsp; I slammed a microwave door.&nbsp; Only because someone took out my food twice and left it sitting open on the counter.&nbsp; Oooh was I pissed.&nbsp; Then, I didn't want to be here anymore.&nbsp; Then my coworker called me at 10 til 7 to ask me when I'd be back, after I had call him to let him know that I would be back at 7.&nbsp; If this was the first time that had happened I would have been, like, whatever.&nbsp; But it happens a lot.&nbsp; And it gets more and more annoying every single time.&nbsp; So I told him over the radio, in a really mean tone, it's not 7 yet.&nbsp; I'm on my way.&nbsp; Grrr. That was it.&nbsp; Nothing big.&nbsp; Nothing small.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Nothing is also better than something when something is asshole coworkers.&nbsp;  And asshole friends who steal back there game system like a thief in the night.&nbsp; You thought I had&nbsp;forgotten, huh?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; But now I have my snes and I don't&nbsp;neeeeed your stupid little controller with a&nbsp;whole bunch of wires and a gun and another controller and I think that's all.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, fart on your grave!!! Asshole tracybaconfat thief.&nbsp;  It is almost time for me to go home.&nbsp; I'm so very happy. Sometimes when I say SC Johnson, it sounds like assy johnson...I thought it was funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Hi mike.&nbsp; I read your blog.&nbsp; I didn't know you were still writing in it otherwise I would have read it alot sooner.&nbsp; As not to get too far behind.&nbsp; Boy, was I shocked to click on your name and see the novel you had written since the smelly poo incident.&nbsp; One thing though.&nbsp; It's not a comma!! It's an apostrophe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I was having a&nbsp;"dumb" day.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a day unlike any other.&nbsp; It only comes, like,&nbsp;once a week&nbsp;or so.&nbsp; So, I don't really know anything about comma's but I know when to use an apostrophe...sometimes.&nbsp;  But mike.&nbsp; Let's talk about you.&nbsp; Do you think that because I use a lowercase 'm' when writing your name, (good comma, bad comma?) I think little of you?&nbsp; I don't.&nbsp; I just don't like taking the time to hit the shift key, hold it and then hit the m key.&nbsp; I'm lazy.&nbsp; But back to you... is heather pregnant yet?&nbsp; Is she? Is she? Is she?&nbsp; Hm...&nbsp; You know, mike,&nbsp;you don't lead a very interesting life.&nbsp; I mean, you work.&nbsp; And then you go&nbsp;to church.&nbsp; That's about it.&nbsp; See where the lack of&nbsp;interesting is?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us about you&nbsp;mike!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't just comment.&nbsp; You have to&nbsp;post something.&nbsp; If you like I can make up an interesting story about you and heather.&nbsp;&nbsp;What'cha think??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      'something' is herpes.  Or constipation.  Or a dead cat.  Or a big bag of spiders.   Good things:  Hey guess what I got for my birthday!!!&nbsp; A super nintendo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I'm so happy.&nbsp; I'm so very happy.&nbsp; I played it last night and again this morning.&nbsp; I used to kick ass at super mario brothers, now I suck a little.&nbsp; But who cares, it's fun as crap.&nbsp; I'm going to play it again tonight.   Other things:  My car&nbsp;is supposed to be ready on Friday.&nbsp; Supposed to be.  I'm still trying to figure out how to go about this bartending thing.&nbsp;  I might become a paranormal investigator.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Only if everyone in the organization likes me.&nbsp; Otherwise I won't.&nbsp;   Bad thing:  I have a flea bite that is just a tit too close to my pubic area.&nbsp;   Rant thing:  Now, I have never had an STD before, so&nbsp;I'm finding it hard&nbsp;(in my older years) to understand why someone would have unprotected sex.&nbsp; I mean, just knowing that there&nbsp;is not much&nbsp;protecting my&nbsp;crotch from those fucking&nbsp;fleas freaks me the hell out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just find it funny that&nbsp;after people fuck without a condom their biggest worry is "oh my god what if I'm pregnant" and not "oh my God what if my crotch rots away."   End things.   Nikol, are you moving to Milwaukee?&nbsp; If you are... take me with you.   &nbsp;

       being aggressive. I mean, mean. I'm not this way because I'm an asshole. It's simply because I don't understand somethings or I strongly disagree with them. I can't hold them in, I tend to explode under pressure.   smoking.     writing songs while having never taken the time to learn to play the piano.    playing the guitar.     starting things and never finishing them.     my job.    fleas.  I have 41 count'em baby!  41 flea bites.      military life.    tomatoes.   salad.   vegetables in general, excluding baby carrots.     cucumbers especially.   flowers.  They smell funny and then they die.   being poor.   driving everywhere I have to go.   not knowing how to accomplish anything in reality.  In my head I'm SuperThalia!!   having a 1.9 GPA.   striving to become more than average.   boinking.   being overweight.   wearing the inner thigh of my jeans away because my fucking thighs rub together.   worrying about being overweight.   my size 12 feet.   my nearsighted vision and my astigmatism.   being confronted when I can't remember the insulting comment that I made about your big nose, flabby gut, back fat, bellyroll, love handles, nose hair, chest hair, ass hair, small breasts, cankles, buthigh, or any other physical characteristic you have that may be less than perfect because 9 times out of 10, if it wasn't your teeth or height (latter only for males), I wasn't serious.   being confronted when I do remember the insulting comment I made about your way of life, intelligence level, and/or whoristic tendencies because 9 times out of 10 I meant what I said and I won't change my story simply because you found the testicular fortitude to speak your mind, assuming or hoping that I would change mine.   controlling my anger. Sometimes people piss me off and they never know it because I breathe and count and remove myself from their sight. Someday I'd like to remove them from mine.   compromising situations in public places.  (Shiver.)   guys with small penises who are in such a fucking hurry to whip them out at first sight of a pretty girl.   forgetting to call my mom back.     Neko.  He's the one that gave me fleas.  Cat bastard.   depending on someone.   doubting any part of me.    constantly thinking that maybe he/she doesn't like/love me because he/she/they did/didn't do blank.   growing up and growing apart.  No matter how you sugar coat it, it stills seems pointless now.   having to decide whether I should stay or go. If I need to I should, but if I can't afford to I shouldn't. Even though I NEED to.   my lack of privacy.  -------------------------   finding more flea bites.  43.   seeing my family in the position they are in and knowing that I can't help them without hurting them and myself.   knowing that I can't save the world...in reality.   Cause you know, in  my head I'm SuperThalia!!   finding a new job.   meeting new people.   dating. I wouldn't mind an arranged marriage. I've decided to just walk up to that stupid boy and say hey, I'm not really into this whole dating thing, so if we could skip it and just go get married that would be great.   the fact that my father is dead. Dead, dead, dead. How much does it suck when somedays you wake up and (on some level) forget that. After 5 fucking!! years. Oh, just a lil'.     I think I may have covered every dislike I have.   Everything else I can live with.       Nikol, are you sure you tried calling  everyone  Saturday??  Well, I hope Trast feels better soon and you get some grown time too.

      Silence.&nbsp; Pauses.&nbsp; Woman, you cannot depend on guys to figure things out.&nbsp; They don't work that way.&nbsp; Next time you see him, just flat out ask him if he'd like to shove his tongue in yor mouth.  "Then I left and hung my head in the car. "  Most people use fuzzy dice.

      Anyone??  Today I talked to that stupid boy that I think/thought liked me.  Last I checked he doesn't like me.  Now, I'm pretty sure he doesn't cause I asked him out and he said no.  Well, not exactly.  I didn't exactly ask him out and so technically he couldn't have said no.  But that's kinda what happened.    I said (total pick up line now that I think about it) I wanted to ask you, do you hang around Racine at all?  Or just Oak Creek?  (the last part was a muffled whisper)  He said, just Oak Creek mostly.  I just come here for work.  (this is him rejecting me.  if it were me I would have said not really, why?  you know, leaving room for the big question or suggestion.)  I said, oh.  Then there was silence, but it wasn't awkward.  It was more like how do I go about this now.  Do I just bring up bars in the area and say he should hang out one night.  Or do I just ask him if he wants to hang out one time.  Or do I just take that as a no.  I had one of those moments that I thought only happened to Ally McBeal.  His coworkers came in from smoking.  Well, great.    Did I mention we were in the back room.  Alone.  Anyway we left there and we up front and he said if there's anything else I can help you with call back or something along those lines.  The rejection had set in by then so I wasn't really paying attention.  Then I smiled a defeated smile and said I'm good thanks and he said keep smiling.  Smiled again.  Then I left and hung my head in the car.     What's wrong with me?  Why doesn't the stupid boy like me?  If he knew I called him a stupid boy then I'd understand.  But right now I don't.  And it's annoying.

      Have you ever had one of those days?   It's good though.   This means friday will feel like saturday,  saturday will feel like sunday.  And come sunday it will feel like monday, but it won't be.  I'll have another full day off to enjoy.    I got a call from this guy Skye, he's in a band.  I was going to audition to be the lead singer, but I told him I wouldn't because I didn't want to be the cause of a shitty position if my stupid car decides it doesn't give a fuck about my having to work and go to school.  I called Kevin again and I know he wanted to abandon all of his customer service etiquette.  But I had to know somethings before I let him fix my car.  I hate not being able to trust people.  I'm so happy to be off work.  So happy.    I don't think we're doing anything this weekend for Bobin's birthday.     Nikol, I left you a vm letting you know.

      I'm working 3rd shift tonight.&nbsp; Somebody called in sick.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp; I need the overtime anyway.&nbsp; I'm at the FC.&nbsp; It's cool here.&nbsp; I'm alone.&nbsp; Alone, alone, alone.&nbsp;  I have absolutely nothing of importance to say about my life.&nbsp;  But Robin is turning 25 in ten days.&nbsp; It's about that time again people!&nbsp; Celebrate good times, come on!&nbsp; Well, I don't exactly know what we are going to do for Robin's birthday, just yet.&nbsp; But I hope it involves alcohol, melted candle wax and sweaty man-body.&nbsp; Yeah, that would be fun.&nbsp;  I get to flirt with my cute guy again on Friday.&nbsp; Just to let you guys know.&nbsp; I'm not going to ask him out or anything.&nbsp; Robin said I should play with him a little more.&nbsp; And&nbsp;once I get him hooked then I can go in for the kill.&nbsp; If he decides to give up then I'll know he wasn't&nbsp;right for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Riiight?&nbsp; Right!! Sometimes I think it would be pointless to be in a relationship right now&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; I have a lot of more important things in my life.&nbsp; School.&nbsp; My family and friends.&nbsp; Bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, all important&nbsp;stuff.&nbsp; Bringing&nbsp;in a guy&nbsp;would be like bringing in a&nbsp;child.&nbsp; Only you can't lock this one in a closet because by all rights and purposes he should be at least half a foot taller than you and weigh a good 30lbs more than you.&nbsp; (For any of you&nbsp;who didn't know this I read it in this book called...um...short..girlie&nbsp;men...and the women who ...&nbsp;should&nbsp;be skinned alive, then&nbsp;beat&nbsp;with a switch for loving them.&nbsp; That sounds&nbsp;good right?)&nbsp; What was I talking about??&nbsp; Well, I'm gonna go&nbsp;smoke a little and try&nbsp;to&nbsp;stay awake.&nbsp;  I hope you guys have a good day tomorrow.&nbsp; Cause I know I will. You know what I just realized!!!&nbsp; These people left me alone in this place with the hanger doors open.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something could walk in here and eat me.&nbsp; WHOLE.&nbsp; Well, like half of me, then if it didn't choke to death, the other half.&nbsp; Just put yourselves in my shoes for a moment.&nbsp;  Damn people.&nbsp;Leaving these damn doors open like they ain't go no sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tracybaconfat.&nbsp; Tracy.&nbsp; Bacon.&nbsp; Fat.&nbsp; TRACYBACONFAAAAAATuh!!!)&nbsp; Just felt like loving one of my friends.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I can tell he doesn't like you one bit.&nbsp; Dork. &nbsp; So, here's some cool news for you!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ned and I are going to start looking at places together.&nbsp; You know, houses.&nbsp; Houses with more bedrooms and a yard and pets allowed and a dishwasher and a big kitchen and a great room that I can use as a studio so I can start painting again.&nbsp; He wants to keep his place in Milwaukee for a bit, but if we find some place we love we'll sign the lease and the boys and I will move in and he'll pay half the rent and move in gradually &nbsp;and wouldn't that be awesome?&nbsp; He loves me, Thalia!&nbsp; And the great shit about that is  I  love  him,  too.&nbsp; So, my question for you is, should I be looking for a place with a bedroom for you, too?&nbsp; You know, so you could live rent free in exchange for a minimal amount of childcare, go to school at a local tech place  and  hang out with me a whole lot?&nbsp;&nbsp; *waggling my eyebrows*&nbsp; The only rule of the house is that after the kids go to sleep, you have to walk around nude and maybe jump up and down a little.

      A friend of mine had a birthday party last weekend.&nbsp; I would have gone had I remembered.&nbsp; So instead, I slept.&nbsp; It was a good sleep.&nbsp; A 12 hour&nbsp;sleep.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was half an hour late for work.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was okay though because I didn't care.&nbsp; (Remember, I hate&nbsp;my job.)&nbsp;  That same friend just told me something very interesting today.&nbsp; She told me that she met, made out with,&nbsp; has the home and cell&nbsp;phone number of the lead singer from Fuel,&nbsp;he also bought her a diamond cross pendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for a moment I actually thought to say, wow, I'm so jealous of you.&nbsp; But then, I realized that was a lie.&nbsp; I was in no way, shape or form jealous of her.&nbsp; I thought it was really cool that it&nbsp;happened to her.&nbsp; (Am I truly that gullible?...)&nbsp; But there was no envy.&nbsp; Just amusement.&nbsp; I like amusement, it's funna.&nbsp; I just found that whole situation interesting and had to share it.&nbsp;  Good things:  I found out the source of my bites.&nbsp; Some creature is living in my bed.&nbsp; It could be a flea or a tick, tic, whatever, or a lice or a crab.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully it's neither.&nbsp; I'd rather it be Tammy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But something bit me last night and it was actually painful.&nbsp; I thought maybe it was skin cancer.&nbsp; So, yay.   My car is in the process of getting fixed.&nbsp; JD Byrider isn't that bad of a place.&nbsp; They are letting me make payments.&nbsp; I owe Kevin a chocolate chip cookie.&nbsp; I may spit in it.&nbsp; Cause I don't appreciate being lied to, but he did put in a little effort to get the payment plan approved.&nbsp; So, yay.   Nikol, tell Ned that I will give him a cookie too if he sits with the kids while we go out and get piss drunk.&nbsp; But I won't spit in it... cause he's a nice guy...Notice how I put this under the list of good things...please don't disappoint me on my birthday...cause, um, well, maybe it's not exactly  my  birthday, but if it were, would you disappoint me?&nbsp; That would be harsh, I would never recover.&nbsp; I'd be forever afraid to celebrate my birthday knowing there was a possibility that someone would disappoint me.&nbsp; So, yay????&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Other thing:  Talked to the boy that I think/thought liked me and turns out he&nbsp;doesn't.&nbsp; What a horrible birthday.... anyway.&nbsp; I didn't find this out the hard way.&nbsp; That's a good thing.&nbsp; But this is what my spidey senses are telling me-I can't believe I just said that.&nbsp; Well he left me a message and I called him back.&nbsp; I said hey it's thals and he said hey beautiful.&nbsp; I giggled.&nbsp; He said I called you earlier and I was disappointed when I got your voice mail cause I wanted to talk to you.&nbsp; I giggled, and said!! see that's why I called and asked to speak with you.&nbsp; I said assed..not asked...not axed...assed.&nbsp; I can't pronounce the k in that word.&nbsp; And he said well, thank you that just made my day.&nbsp; I said awww.&nbsp; Then I assed him a serious question and he said just to remind him when I come in again, he said "just talk to me then.&nbsp; You have to specifically ask for me."&nbsp; I said okay, I will definitely ask for you.&nbsp; Then, say it with me class, I giggled.&nbsp; Awww, how cute.&nbsp; Excuse me whilst I choke it back.&nbsp; I'm so gay around that kid.&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; But it's okay.&nbsp; But seriously people what if&nbsp;he doesn't&nbsp;really like me and he's just uber nice.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll never know&nbsp;until I know.&nbsp; I think I'll write him a note.&nbsp;  That's all.

      You could lure me with your purdy eyes, instead.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I will try my darndest to get a sitter.&nbsp; Perhaps my darling Ned w0uld be willing to stay with them if it means my happiness and a night with the girls.&nbsp; He's a peach about that sort of thing.&nbsp; Pardon my funny mood here.&nbsp; I need adult company.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You know, you have a habit of calling while the kids are talking to their dad, so I don't even realize you called until hours later when I&nbsp;pick up the phone to dial 1-900-whythefuckdoesn'tanybodycallme and hear the stuttered dial tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      It's about 4'30pm.&nbsp; I'm at work.&nbsp; I've been here since 7am.&nbsp; It's okay though.&nbsp; I only work 4 hours tomorrow.&nbsp; I talked to Tony last night and he has a friend that might be able to fix my car for a cheaper rate. That would be lovely now wouldn't it.&nbsp; Lettuce pray.&nbsp;  I'm trying to be in a better mood and smile and stuff and pretend that I'm as happy as I was about three months ago.&nbsp; I miss school.&nbsp;  I can't wait til it starts again.&nbsp; I'm going for a 4.0 this year.&nbsp; That would bring my gpa up from a 1.9 to a ... 2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny if it does.&nbsp; I'd cry so much.&nbsp;  &nbsp; This song describes how I feel right now: (Well, not the whole song - cuz don't nobody be rippin' my slips downtown.) (And if you change skid row to Racine...now that doesn't work.&nbsp; Just go with it people.) &nbsp; Poor!  All my life I've always been poor. I keep asking God what I'm for, and he tells me "Gee, I'm not sure.&nbsp;  Sweep that floor, kid." Oh, I started life as an orphan, a child of the street Here on skid row. He took me in, gave me shelter, a bed, crust of bread and a job Treats me like dirt, calls me a slob,  Which I am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So I live&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Downtown That's your home address.

Bid the gutter farewell and get outta here. I'd move heaven and hell to get outta Skid.  I'd do I dunno what to get outta Skid.  But a hell of a lot to get outta Skid.

      Today I called securitas to see if I could get an advance on my check.&nbsp; She said "no".&nbsp; I said "okay that's all."&nbsp; Then we hung up.&nbsp;  I called JD Byrider to see if the machanic (Kevin) had spoken to anyone in the office about a payment plan and he laughed and said no.&nbsp; I laughed a little too, it was 8'30am.&nbsp; I'm desparate.&nbsp; Still not desparate enough to whore, but desparate enough to joke about whoring.&nbsp; I really like using whore as a verb.&nbsp; And funner as an adjective.&nbsp; It's funny stuffin'.&nbsp; Anyway...He hadn't spoken to anyone because they weren't in the office yet.&nbsp; So, I told him that I've been calling places and pricing (trying to) used engines and the last place I talked to told me that&nbsp;he'd need the 8th digit of the vin and the date of something or another.&nbsp; My reason for calling Kevin.&nbsp; He said well, I've been doing the same.&nbsp; I said okay.&nbsp; Then silence.&nbsp; Then he said something else.&nbsp; Then silence.&nbsp; You see, I was waiting for him to say ok, here are the vin and date.&nbsp; He said nothing.&nbsp; So I said hey, can I have the vin and date?&nbsp; He said hang on a sec.&nbsp; Then he gave me the vin and said he didn't have the date.&nbsp; I said well the guy said he needs the date and it's some where on the door and he said...it's funny... he said, 'I don't have it.'&nbsp; I said okay bye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the times I've&nbsp;been in my car I've never noticed that date, why would he?&nbsp; Maybe it wasn't there.... So, I called the guy at the place about the engine and gave him the info and he said well we really need that date and I said Kevin told me he didn't have it.&nbsp; And the other guy said 'all he had to do was open the damn door.'&nbsp; So, I told him I'd go there myself and call him back.&nbsp; The other guy was a nice guy, he still gave me a price range 500-600.&nbsp; That doesn't help.&nbsp; I was a little angry that Kevin didn't give me the date.&nbsp; I didn't think he was shady, until now.&nbsp; This is why I hate people.&nbsp; But what to do?&nbsp;  &nbsp; I need a cigarette.&nbsp; I need a new job.&nbsp; I need a new life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need a new car.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tam's mom was talking to me this morning about how stupid I was for always jumping in to things.&nbsp; Not her exact words, but the basic jist.&nbsp; I'm sure I needed to hear that, just not today.&nbsp; Then I mentioned that I'd just sell my bed and tv.&nbsp; And Tam's mom said you won't get much for it.&nbsp; Again, was probably the truth, just didn't need to hear it today.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So, I'm done.&nbsp; I don't care anymore.&nbsp; I'm going to pay my bills.&nbsp; I'll get the fucking car&nbsp;eventually.&nbsp; If I have to quit school for the semester then I will.&nbsp; Not like I've never dropped out of school before.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; But, I'm so tired of this shit.&nbsp; So tired.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And Nikol I work today thru next wednesday.&nbsp; I have a four day thur thru sunday and the girls and I were going to hang out&nbsp;next weekend, I think, for Robin's birthday.&nbsp; Not sure what we're doing yet, but&nbsp;if you're up for it and could find a babysitter,&nbsp;it'd be great if you could hang too.&nbsp; You have to meet all the girls and hang out with us all eventually.&nbsp; Can I persuade you with alcohol???&nbsp; C'mon, you know you want to.&nbsp; C'mon.&nbsp; Well, I'll call you tonight&nbsp;after 8 to see.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Girly, you work too hard.&nbsp; You know you do.&nbsp; I'm sorry you're having a bad day.&nbsp; Do you have any time off early next week?&nbsp; The boys and I could use a day away from Whitewater and all the fun it has to offer.

      She said I would not understand.  Slammed the door and said I'm sorry I  Had a bad day again.  &nbsp;  My car needs the engine replaced.&nbsp;  And the radiator.  And I need a front wheel bearing or baring or whatfuckingever.  Total cost: $1200.00  I had to cancel my drug testing appt at Covance.&nbsp; They would have paid me $1200.00.  Something's&nbsp;not right.  I really don't&nbsp;need this shit right now.  All I've ever wanted to do was&nbsp;provide for my family and friends.&nbsp; I can't do any of that in the position I'm in right now.&nbsp; Granted had I not provided for my family in the past I wouldn't be in this position.&nbsp; But shit happens.&nbsp; You live, you fucking learn.&nbsp; I haven't.&nbsp; So I will remain in this position until the day I set myself on fire on the east or west coast, preferably the east coast.  I wanted to cry a little today.  I wanted to quit my job.  I'm being a real shit to everyone...and I don't care.  I'm having a BAD DAY.  You know what really pisses me&nbsp;off.&nbsp;  People are smiling and waving today&nbsp;as they leave.&nbsp; I don't feel like smiling.&nbsp; I feel like saying to hell with it.&nbsp; All of it.&nbsp; All of it except my babies.&nbsp; laya, day and erra.&nbsp; I have to stay for them.&nbsp; Cause in my head, nobody loves them as much as me.&nbsp; And in reality nobody sees them less than me.&nbsp; That's sad.&nbsp; I don't have time though.&nbsp; When I do have time all I want to do is wallow in self pity.&nbsp; I like wallowing.&nbsp;  Yes, and today, it's all over 1200 dollars.&nbsp; But you have to understand the cycle.  I have a shit load of other bills.&nbsp; I've added to them 3 times in the last 4 or 5 years.&nbsp; My laptop, my car, and my credit card.&nbsp; All things that have benefited me.&nbsp; My laptop for school work, my car to get to and from school and my cc to slowly but surely rebuild my credit.&nbsp; Other shit just comes up.&nbsp; Like my dental bills and my hospital bills and the electric bill and other shit on my report.&nbsp; And every time I pay something off, something else comes up.&nbsp; And it's quite discouraging.&nbsp; Ya know.  And this fucking phone will not stop ringing!&nbsp; I hate my job!!  But that's it.&nbsp; It never ends.&nbsp; It won't ever end.&nbsp; And it sucks.&nbsp; What sucks even more&nbsp;is I can't kill myself because I don't have life insurance!!!!&nbsp; (I'm just angry, suicide is for sissies.)&nbsp; How pathetic is that?!?!  Probably not more than this blog.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      You called me a twit!!!  How could you???   Listen asshole!  I was saying if I averaged 125, but came home once or twice with more than 125, oh say, about 150, or less than 125, oh perhaps 100, I'd still manage to break even if I stayed above 100!! 125 times the 4, four, IV, 1+1+1+1 = 4 weeks in a month is 500.  100 times the 4 weeks in a month equals 400.  400 does not, will not, won't fucking ever, !!Tammy!!, equal 500.   fucktard!!

      yeay, alright, yeay!  *does a little birthday dance* thanks thals.  I would say you were the first to wish me a happy b-day today, but it was actually e-online who sent me a b-day greeting.  but your more important, so you win.  Yepper, I'm the big 2-3 today (why can you put "the big" in front of anything and it sounds more important, like "the big guy's coming".   big just means large, and large is another word for fat, but if one were to say "the fat guy's coming"  noone would think he's important, just fat. I don't get it *shrugs*)  I was actually thinking about that this morning, not the fat thing, but the 23 thing.  I think I'm getting old.  I can still vegly rememer 16 and I long for it.  Well, its noon and I have nothing to do, that the only sucky part about having your b-day on a weekday, everyones working.  but thats o.k....I kinda like the me time.  although Tracy Baconfat (ha, baconfat) and Erika Sausageroll (ha, sausageroll) don't work till 3 and I am still waiting for them to call me and wish me a happy b-day. Maybe I'll go outside or something, I hear outsides nice this time of year.  I want to say away from the mall, but theres this buddah I want to buy...maybe if I don't pass by sears they won't suck me in.  (for those who don't know,I work at sears, which is in the mall.  I hate my job as well.  Thus the delema) Thals, we need to hurry up and become famous, this working for a living thing is really getting on my nerves.  Hey, are we watching inu tonight or going out, or both, I'm so confused.   Well , I'm going to go do something, so be good everyone.  comments to recent postings:  I don't like posting comments one the actually page.  Then people have to go back through and find which of the posts have been commented on.  I believe this is much more efficient  Signs  - "If I bartend and make at least $50-150 per shift, averaging $125 per shift..."    -the average would be 100, you twit.  - "I've been bitten by at least 9 creatures. Or one that's hell bent on my demise."    - sorry.....that was me.   - "And I've been gaining a lot of weight. It's genetics, man. I can't fight it."    -lol....yeah....me too....whatever helps us get through the day.

      Job related- This morning: I overslept again.   Tammy told me I was accepted at Covance.  (Latest lab rat.)  Yesterday: I figured away to earn at least $2000 a month.  No whoring involved. If I bartend and make at least $50-150 per shift, averaging $125 per shift (4 shifts) per week, I will have a monthly net income of $2000.  If I stay here and work once a week, or more, I could bring home $250+ a month.  If I make less bartending any given week, I could work an extra shift here.  There is room for error because I'm not including my paycheck from bartending because I don't know how things work in that area.  Either way, I'm pleased with my calculations.   I called this 800 number for bartending.  It's called bar careers and it's much cheaper than any bartending college ($90).  They teach you to make 50 drinks (I can't make any) and you're guaranteed employment.  Plus you get to keep the tools for an additional $30.  No extra charges, unless you relocate and would like help finding a new job bartending.  Even then it's $10/mo.  Sounds good to me.  The only thing that weirded me out was that the guy I spoke to the first time was the same guy that answered the phone the second time.  This leads me to believe it's probably basement based.  Oh well.  Health related: I'm anemic.   I'm shaking. I've been bitten by at least 9 creatures.  Or one that's hell bent on my demise.   The areas are red.  I'm black, no part of my person should be red.  At any time.   My contacts are about 2 months older than they should be.   I have a serious smoke related cough that's causing my chest to ache. My nose is stuffy. My throat aches.   It's not a cold though.  I don't get colds more than once every few years. I was lightheaded this morning.   And I've been gaining a lot of weight.  And it's not because of the suzy Q's and the Thai food and the ice cream and cake and pigs in a blanket and burger king and mcdonalds and wendy's and taco bell and pizza hut and candy bars and hot tamales and just about anything else horribly unhealthy you can think of.  It's genetics, man.  I can't fight it.    Romance related: N/A  Fast track to stardom: ...coming soon...  No-sing else, I donut think.

      Oh my God!  I'm blind, I'm blind.  I over slept this morning and was half an hour late for work.  Have I told anyone lately that I hate my job?  And I need a cigarette.  I've only had half a cigarette and I've been awake for a good hour now.   TAMMY!!!!!!  DID YOU CHECK MY EMAIL AND DELETE MY DRUNK DIALING POST.  IF YOU DIDN'T YOU SHOULD HAVE.   Nikol I think you're right.  I think he's like me.   I also think I'm still a little um... not sober.   But I'm going to attempt to do more than smile next time I talk to him, I do anyway, but I feel like a kid or something most of the time.   Yeah, still a little um...  I don't think it's good to be awake when you're sobering up.  The sleep monster comes for me in the form of a blink.  I know, I can feel it.   People keep coming into my field of vision.  I wonder if I still have drool on the side of my face.  I wonder what my hair is doing.  I wonder if that's why people are looking away from me when they walk in.  I wonder if I smell of alcohol as much as I think I do.  I can't wait til my break.  I'm taking a nap.  Naps are good.  Mmm, nap.  I wonder if this coffee will help. Have you ever had that feeling, when you're some place you'd rather not be and then you start to focus on the day being over and suddenly it is.  Neither have I, but that's what I'm going for.   Wow, there was just a weirdness in my tummy.  Oh now I think today might be ending a little sooner than I planned.

      He works at this place and I think he likes me.  He's cute.  His name is Dale.  I don't know anything else about him.  But he seems cool.  This here is what happened, this is why I think he likes me.  I came in one day and he told me my hair was cool.  (Before the pixie cut.  Oh for everyone I haven't seen, Nikol.  I cut my hair.)  Then I smiled and said thank you and he said you have a really nice smile too.  Then he reacted as if I distracted him from his work.  It was small talk from that point, that day.  Then I was there on Friday and he said, something like, I was asking myself who is this beautiful woman then I realized I had met you before.  And I said oh, you called me one day and it didn't sound like you remembered me.  He was like no, that wasn't the case.  Well, he was dealing with a customer and I noticed he kept looking at me and when he walked by me he'd smile at me.  Then when he was done with that guy I walked over and he said I purposely rushed through that so I could help you.  And of course I just cheesed.  Then, we made small talk and at one point he said you know, you're a really cool person.  Then it was small talk again.  This is why I think he likes me.  He's cute.  I think he's cute.  But I don't know if he likes me or if he's just a really nice guy.  Hmmm.

      Turns out I'm not a hardcore Christian.  Turns out I'm not even Christian.  Go fucking figure.  I had this hour long conversation with my friends the other night about religion.  I believe in God, not totally appreciative of Jesus and Mary.  So, instead of calling it Christianity because that's how I was raised, I've decided that I'm not calling it anything.  I'm not Atheist and I'm not Agnostic.  I don't doubt there is a God.  I totally believe that there is a higher power.    ...of this so, this is the last religious post I'm ever doing.

      Today isn't even over, yet I know it won't progress.  Life sucks.  My job sucks.  Not today's job.  Switchboard.  It's fun here.  I just don't like being a security guard.  It's not fun.  It's stupid and I hate it.  I'm whinning now.  Does whinning have 1 'n' or 2?  I donut care.  I donut.  I donut.  I donut.  I think it would be a funner word if they changed do not to donut.  I donut want to go.  I donut like green eggs and ham.  I like donut...s.  Look at it.  It's weird.  donut donut donut donut donut donut donut donut.  Is it weird for you yet? donut donut donut donut.   Oh, but today...I talked to Nikol.  Everything is peachy keen.  She's getting used to being treated (by Ned) like she's worth more than she'll ever know.  I'm happy for her.  A lot of guys are assholes.  She scored.  Go Nikol, it's your birthday.  We gon' party like it's your birthday, we gon' sip bacardi like it's your birthday.  Cause you know we don't give a **** cause it's your birthday.  Hey, when is your birthday, Nikol? I drank bacardi one time.  I got soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank gin one time.  I got soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank E&J one time.  I go soooooo drunk that it started to taste like water. I drank beer one time.  Then I threw up.  Too much liquid in my belly. I know my limit now.   4 shots of doctor, 2 shots of hot sex, 3 mixed drinks, 2 shots of really hard stuff, 2 beers...on a full stomach. Otherwise it's just 2 beers and 2 shots of anything. Whatelse about today? My car is a piece of shit.  No it's not, I love my car.  It's a good car.  It just has some bad parts.  They are getting replaced on wednesday.  It's gonna be over $300 and I really don't have the money to pay for it.  So, they are just going to have to work with me.   Well, I think that's all.  Oh, I got an peanut m&m today that was all chocolate.  I wasn't impressed.

      I just ate the biggest peanut m&m I've ever seen.  The peanut wasn't that big but that's okay.  The candy coating and chocolate shell was huge.  And mighty tasty.   I have 48 minutes left of work.  And three mediocre sized m&m's left.  Whatever shall I do?!?!?!   It's still okay.  I have a green one, an orange one and a blue one.  It's really weird.  They look kind of cool sitting on a sheet of white paper.  Cause, you know, the colors are so bright and the paper is white so...yeah.  Sorry.  I'm just really bored.  I want to nap.   45 minutes to go.   Oh no!!  Something happened to my orange m&m.  I think I ate it.  I'm ashamed now.  Wow, that made a lot of difference.  Now the other two just look blah.  It was the orange one that was making it look cool.  What have I done!   Anyway.   And another one bites, and another one bites, another one bites the dust.  No more blue!   42 minutes left.   I think I need a fashion makeover.  Ooh! ooh!!  I talked to Tammy last night about this, I think my biological clock is broken.  It ticks normally for a while then it just stops.  Then it shakes and ticks once, then shakes some more.  Then it's normal again.  I think I need a penis.  One of my very own.  I will love him and hug him and call him George.  Unless his name isn't George.  And I'm pretty sure I wont love him.  At least not in the brain malfunction-y kind of way.  In more of a physical sense.   33 minutes. I can't wait until I'm famous.  Then I can finally marry Mel Gibson.  And sleep with Johnny Depp.  The Depp.  Them will be the days!!  You know, I never really liked Johnny until I saw Don Juan DeMarco(???) like, 6 months ago.  I still don't know what Robin sees in Tom Cruise.  He's okay.  Nothing special.  I think I'd have to pass up the oppurtunity to sleep with him.  *whispers* he's short.  But James Marsters, you know even if he was 5'5 I'd find a way.  I love him.  Not as much as I love Mel Gibson, but it's love all the same.  I don't love Johnny.  I just like him a lot.  I could miss a movie he was in.  But not Mel or James. 23 minutes. I'm still sleepy.  The phones have stopped ringing.  Nevermind. This really happened today, I thought it was humorous.  I kept it to myself though.  Until now. (slightly one sided.) Me - SC Johnson this is Thalia. Him - murr murr murr. Me - I'm sorry??? Him - murr murr murr. Me - Um...Escort Services? Him - Yes. Me - I... don't... understand. Him - murr murr murr. murr murr. murr. murr murr murr. Me - Ohhhhh! Export Services!! Ha. Him - (dead silence) Me - Sorry. (click)   11 minutes left and now I'm done.

      I tried to post this as a comment and it didn't show it... so I'm making it a new post. You've got a Stupid blog. *shakes head*  My poem to Thalia. Because she was mad at me. And insecure because she didn't think I loved her... when in truth, She just didn't see how. I did. And do. So there. Now I have to remember the poem again. Blah! Stupid Blog!     You and Me  No matter what happens in life Or where our paths should lead us... No matter if we live till we're ninety Or if sharks come tomorrow and eat us.  No matter if I work second shift Or if you have two jobs. No matter if we're getting along Or if, sometimes, we're at odds.  No matter if we go off to school Or you move far away. No matter if you think I'm cool My mom does anyway.  No matter if you go work in Nevada And catch a skeevy rash. No matter if I lose my job And become trailer trash.  It doesn't matter, on a given day, Which one of us is hotter. And it doesn't matter if I end up gay And you turn out to be not...ter.  No matter who I'm dating Or who you choose to see. No matter if I'm mad at you Or if you're mad at me.  No matter if you hold a grudge Or I turn my shoulder cold. No matter if we can see our faults Or if, sometimes, we need to be told.  No matter what life throws at us Or who we grow to be... We'll always be what we are now, Simply You and Me.  I assumed, my Friend, that you knew this already, But it will do you good to hear it... You will never walk this Earth alone, So don't you ever fear it.

      This bugged me.  Read some of April (recent newsletters) before you continue. http://www.lasttrumpetministries.org  I do not understand people!!  Illuminati??  Witchcraft??  Mel Gibson!!  This guy, organization, whatever, attacked Harry Potter (audio on home page) because it's teaching us (maybe kids, mainly) that witchcraft is good and fun.  He said something about the wizard of oz too.  I don't understand it.   There are two kinds of Christians.  There are the hardcore Christians, such as myself, and there are those psycho christians, this guy.  We, hardcore Christians, will pray, thank God and joke about Jesus making Tammy fall in the dog water all in one breath.  But psycho Christians also pray and thank God, but then they try to force others to do the same.  I don't think that's cool.  People have a right to believe in whatever helps them get through the day.  If it's knowing that God sacrificed his only child for us, then great.  If it's because **Robin knowledge goes here**, great!  That doesn't bother me.  I must admit that I don't like Satan worshipers though.  Animals should not be sacrificed, that's what children are for.     I don't read the bible, it's more of a point of reference for me.  It'd be better if the index was more specific.  That way, if you were considering killing someone you could just look through K's, find kill and read all the scriptures about killing and hopefully see that it's wrong.  If nothing else, at least you'll have made an informed decision.  But, (paragraph point) I don't think the bible was meant to be followed to a T.  If so, what's the point of us being here, we'd only be living to die.  It makes absolutely no sense to me.  I'm going to live my life.  I won't kill anyone, partially because the bible tells me not to and partially because I think it's wrong.  I won't steal.  I'll try not to covet my neighbor's wife...I'm only human.  But, I won't do anything to intentionally harm another person.  How's that?  I'm pretty sure the God that I pray to thinks that I'm a dandy person.  I would have to agree with him.   I had a whole lot more to say, but I don't want to anymore cause believe it or not, I've just bored myself with talks of religion.     Can't believe he mentioned mel gibson.

      yep, its only 7 days, thats right, one week till my birthday. Hazarr!  not like i'm in any hurry to turn 23, I just like birthdays :)  Thanks for the blog about my age thals, it only took me an hour to stop crying, no harm done. *wipes away a tear*  my van has been making this rattleing sound for a couple days now.  kinda like its scraping metal against the pavement, but nothings hanging off.  But good news, it stopped making the sound today.  Can anyone guess why?  Thats right, because whatever was making the sound fell off at the corner of west blvd and haven ave.  My sister took the van to work and called me to let me know this interesting fact. So i went out to go look for the parts and all i found was an old muffler in some guys yard.  might be ours, might not.  guess if the van is making noise that could wake the dead it might be ours.  *shrugs* I'm getting my hair streaked today.  My sis (robin) gave me an early b-day present and said I could get whatever I wanted done to my hair.(origoto nechan! - sound it out, I don't know how to write in Japanese)  My first choice was blonde wih blue streaks, but then I probably would have gotten fired and i like money so I'm settleing for golden blonde with light blonde and read streaks.  I'm not too olo for that style, am I?  If you say yes, so help me god I will find you in your home cut off your legs, set your house on fire and watch as you drag your stumpy ass through the bazing inforno!  but be honest :)  We'll see what happens, its only hair, it'll grow back....but your legs won't!    Sorry, sometimes I get a little angry.  'k, well, I have nothing more to say and I'm hunry, so bye.

      Yeah, I didn't go.  If my mom was there I would have been.  I love my family but I don't know those people.  I don't really know what makes them good.  I haven't seen it in a long time.  I can honestly say that there are a few of them I'd only do something for because I'm a Christian.  That's sad.  I don't even know some of their names.  First or last.  Someone asked me what were the last names of the families, all I knew was Jackson.  That's it.  Oh well.   I miss my mama.  Even though she called me fat.  Well, she never really said hey you're fat.  But if I gained weight she'd ask if I was pregnant and when I lost it she'd ask if I was anorexic.  Sometimes I wonder what she would have said had I answered yes to either of those questions.  It's funny to think about.  Anyway, despite all that I still miss her.  She'll be here sometime this year.  I hope.  She'd better be here.  Otherwise she's gonna get it.  She's a crazy woman.  She encouraged me to be a stripper.  I was never a stripper, but when I was contemplating it, she said go for it.  Regardless of what anyone says I think that's cool as hell.  Which would you rather hear?  You're nasty. Or... go for it?  I made my own decision ultimately, but it was good to know that she wouldn't have hated me if I made the "wrong" one.  Well, Dead Like Me is getting better and better.  Season two starts the last week of July.  I plan to be there.  Oh yeah.  I do.  Happy day that is supposed to be the 4th of July but is actually the 5th...everyone!!  9 or maybe 8.  Wait a minute...yeah it's 9 more days til tammy's berfday!!!

      Tammy will be 23 years old in like 10 days.  That number feels right.  Maybe 9 or 11.  Anyway.  Her birthday is July 14.  She'll be nearly a quarter of a century old.  Almost 2 and a half decades.  Practically 1/40 of a millenia.  She'll be knockin' on thirty before she knows it!  She's already capable of remembering events that took place TWENTY YEARS AGO! TWENTY YEARS AGO!!!    She'll be as old as me.  Today Begins the Countdown to Tammy's Birthday.  It's not even a golden birthday, so I don't know why I'm doing this.  Well, probably because I never got to do it before.  Well, I guess.  It's cool though.  Everyone will know it's Tammy's birthday and they'll all say Happy Birthday Tammy!  Yeah, that is cool.    Why does it look like I just held a conversation with myself?  Robin, my sweet dear Robin, Rob, Bobbin.  It's okay.  You'll be as OLD as Nikol.  Maybe you, Nikol, Erika and Ariel can get together and start a quilting club.  Yeah, it would be cool.  You guys could make your very own special quilts that allow circulation of cool air, so that the hot flashes don't keep you awake when you hit menopause... real soon.    Aren't I the greatest friend in the world!!  I love you guys and you know I'm just kidding.  Besides, quilting is for losers.  So, just to recap, Robin is old.  Tammy is old.  Nikol is old.  Erika is old.  Ariel is old.  Tracy is old.  I don't know how old Maria is, but let's just call her old!  And I too am old.    Robin, 26 more days. Tammy, 10 more days. Nikol, how you doin'? Tracy and Maria, stay gay!! Mike, oh!!  I forgot you're old too, but not as old as Frank.    I can't really make fun of Frank though, he hasn't started reading this yet.  I'd rather my friends know that I'm talking shit about them.    Any who, Mike, I have the thing!!  I was gonna give it to you today but I forgot it.  When you get it you have to promise that it will be displayed somewhere so Karen can see it.  After she sees it you can throw it away...or give it back to me.    Okay, that's all for now.

Well, I'm not having it, dear.    As for the kids, we three adults sat around after they left and talked about how well behaved they are.  Bring them back any time.

        I took the kids to Whitewater today to play with Nikol's kids.  They had a lot of fun.  Nikol didn't seem to think the worst of them so I'll probably take them up again one day soon.  Not like tomorrow, but the kids'll still remember one each other.     I had an issue today.  One that I haven't had since I was in high school.  You know how when you're chillin' in a room with a bunch of cool kids and you're all nervous and stuffin' cause you're so worried about saying or doing something and looking really dumb.  Well, it was kinda like that only they weren't a bunch of cool kids, not that they aren't cool, but they were three really intelligent people and I wasn't worried about looking dumb, I was worried that (as Robin commented) a bit of my true self would emerge and they would all throw up a little once they realized how dumb I am. (In case they haven't already.  Realized it, not thrown up.)  I don't really care when it comes to unimportant things, but I'd say one's intelligence level is somewhat important.  That's what I'd say!  So, Nikol, John, Ned, please don't think that I was being an asshole and isolating myself from you guys just..cause...I'm...an asshole.  I just get a little intimidated around smart folks.  To all who read this, THIS IS MY ISSUE AND I'LL HANDLE IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES.  That's really all I can say on that.  I can fix it and I will.  Whether I realize I am somewhat intelligent or I read an entire set of fucking encyclopedias.  No, Mike, there is no such thing as a set of fucking encyclopedias.  Oh, wait.  Maybe there is.  Anyway, won't change by tomorrow.  So, I'm just hoping nobody thought (even if it was followed by a 'so what') that I must not like them.  Okay.  That's all.

      Well, so far. Today has been the same as everyday. I don't really like the monotony that is my life. I need to do something. I need to do more. I think I might join a club at school. Like...well, I don't really know what. But something. Last year, they had sorority thingamabobs handing out fliers...but I don't want to be in a sorority. Not really my thing. I'm trying to find people to work for me on Friday and Saturday because I'm scheduled to work at Gilligan's. And to all I haven't told, (that's, what, two of you) I will be at Gilligan's on Saturday after I'm done working. So, people should come up and hang out. Directions: Exit the freeway onto National going east. I know the way I take I get off on some side street and I have to take a right at the first stop sign, then a right at the stop and go light (National) then I'm on National. So, just get to National and take it to Barclay, then take a right on Barclay.  The club is in a warehouse looking creature, it's on the left hand side and it says RAIN in front. Gilligan's is the patio bar attached to rain. I think Barclay is the first street east of 1st street. So, even if you take 1st st. just go east at the 1st and National intersection. So, be there or be square. Or beware. Or something. Just be there. Back to reality. I hate my job, i hate my job, i hate my life, i hate my job, the stupid boy still hasn't called and I've given up hope of ever dating again, i hate my job, i hate my job, i have to do my hair, i hate my job, i hate my job, i hate my job, i hate my job, i have to buy khakis, i hate my job, i have to paint my nails, i hate my job. I bought film and I'm going to take pictures really soon and try to have a couple up between posts so there is always something interesting for people to look at. Like poop.

      I don't really know what it is though.  I'm thinking so much about December.  We started on LA Weightloss last december and I've lost a total of 2 pounds.  2 pounds in 8 months.  When I was actually doing what I was supposed to be doing, I was losing.  I lost 20 pounds at one point.  That lasted for all of a week I think.  So, I've gained 18 pounds back.  That's a lot of fat.  We were working out in the mornings, but now we're kinda slacking.  I should probably start again.  I still have my gym membership.  Maybe I should go there.  Maybe I should quit smoking.  Maybe I should lose weight.  Maybe I should.  I have to lose like 40 pounds, well 48.  And I'd like to lose a significant amount of that by the end of December.  Because, I'm saving money and I'm either buying material to make clothes or buy clothes.  So let's see.  If I lose 2-3 pounds a week, let's play around with 2 lbs,  I have about 20 weeks to lose 40 pounds.  I wonder if I can do it.  I'm gonna try.  Starting tomorrow.   So, I'm going to write down everything I eat and whether or not I exercise.  I'll title the blog weightloss something or another just so anyone who is totally not interested in reading about this won't.  So, okay that's it.  I'm gonna try this and I'm going to write the amount of calories and sodium and fat and everything in the foods that I eat, just in case some other fatass is trying to lose weight and needs help.  And I'll post pictures like once a month in the same clothes so everyone can see the diff.  Well, that's all.  I think that was my issue.

      I don't like it.  But I guess I have to live with it.   I don't understand it.  I'd rather words were spoken than simply thought.   You know what, fuck this!  I totally expect a lot of people.  I don't really give a shit what anybody thinks.  I am an asshole.  I was born an asshole.  I will die an asshole.  Fuck you if you don't like it.  There is absolutely nothing I can do to change it.  Trust me, I've tried... and I'm done trying.   I'm learning Japanese.

      Pretend you're me for a second. You're superficial, snotty, exceedingly rude, possessive, arrogant, and extremely inappropriate. Are you there yet? Good. I just want you to try and understand what type of person can have this kind of reaction to a specific type of situation. I don't think I overreacted. I don't think I expect too much.  Well, this is just to get something off of my chest. It's my blog.  So okay, here goes.  Dear Tracy,  I just heard from Robin about what happened last week/earlier this week. Really sorry to hear that. Just kind of wandering why I didn't hear it from you? I realize that this is probably something that wasn't really that big of a deal, but the way Robin explained it, I think it was. But who cares, right? I don't really want to talk about this...at all. I'd just like to explain why I feel this way, in my blog. If you read this and you want to comment go for it, if not, cool. It's just that I know that we've had these talks so many times and I'd rather avoid it this time as much as you would, because obviously neither of us were listening to eachother. I continue to expect things of you and you continue to not deliver. Well, I think that it would be nice if you felt the need to update me on your life. I don't think that you ever will. I remember I told you a while ago that I'd like to be apart of the good and the bad. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe it was something. Maybe you got it out of your system. Maybe you just didn't think to tell me. Wouldn't that last one suck? Well, I don't really know how to react to this. I'm actually hurt that I heard it almost a week later from Robin. But maybe it just wasn't important. I don't know the reason. I don't really care to. I just had a bitch.

      Well, again with the well.  The stupid boy hasn't called.  I talked to Chris today, like, just now.  Chris is this boy that lives in Minnesota, he's in college and all there.  He works with me until the 22nd of August.  Anyway, I just needed a male perspective.  I need one just about everyday to try and understand this.  If he didn't want to hang out why take the number.  I don't.  I really don't.  If some guy offers me his number and I'm not interested I say no thanks, I'm seeing someone.  If that doesn't work I'll take it, but by then I'm sure he's aware that the odds of him getting a call from me are slim to none.  So, just say no.  No. No. No, you have a right to say no!! I hate this.  I hate dating.  See why I said it before.  This is why.  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!!!!!  Well, my brother and I start our new jobs tomorrow night and I don't really have time to go into detail with anything, so I guess I'll have to update this during the weekend sometime.  PEACE!!!

      I hadn't posted anything today, so I decided maybe I would.  Everything is basically the same.  No calls from anyone, which means, no job, no apartment, no boyfriend type thing.  Exactly how pathetically retarded is my life??  Tomorrow I'm going to hang out with Nikol, Ned, Trast, Ayden, Laya, Day, and Erra.  Someone mentioned fishing.  I plan to watch.  I used to fish with my dad a lot when I was a kid.  When my brothers were at band or football practice, I was with him.  It was cool.  I was thinking about taking the video camera up with me, the kids would have fun with that.  They could make their own little television show.  That was fun for Tammy, Tracy and me.   It was called the Shitcom Show.  It wasn't a sitcom, more like a talk show.  We had Robin and Bobby as our featured guests.  And we were shooting live on location from Tammy and Robin's kitchen.  How cool were we!!!  I'd love to say that this was when we were around 7 or 8, but the truth of the matter is, it was about 5 or 6 months ago.  Them were the days.  I wish I had not-so-much to worry about.  Why is it so hard for someone to live alone and have what they want.  All I want is a nice apartment with soft carpeting and sound proof walls, a decent car, a job that pays well without me having to work 40 hours or more a week.  This really sucks.  Sometimes I wish my dad hadn't left the military.  It would have been cool living in different countries.  I wonder how I would have turned out.   Bottom line, I hate my job.

      None of them have called.  I hate men. That's all I deal with all the time. Men.  I told preston that I was going to marry Nicole Kidman. He looked at me funny. I told him I wasn't really... Not that I wouldn't, cause I would. She's pretty.  Anyway...Seth was supposed to call. Dave was supposed to call. And Dale gave me the distinct impression that he would call.  Seth is this really hot guy that is co-owner(?, manager) of Rain in Milwaukee. I had an interview with him. He wasn't calling "for a good time", he would have been calling to offer me a job as a bartender or server. Dave is the owner of the flat that my brother and I are interested in renting in Milwaukee. It's not the greatest place in the world, but it would be good for now with some new carpeting. I'm kinda hoping that he doesn't call, that way we won't have to move right away. I have a shit load of bills that I would love to pay before I went back to part time and moved out. And Dale, aka the stupid boy, just didn't call. I thought that maybe he would, but he has not. Preston said to be patient. It's only been 2 days. I will try. Even if he doesn't call I will be fine. Just kinda want him to.  And to all of you who know me well: I just caught a glimpse of the reflection of my fingers as I was typing this and it kinda freaked me out a little cause I thought it was a giant spider. Yes, I am retarded.  And you're all... I can't remember what I called you guys yesterday... assholes ... dill holes ... butt plugs ... fuck tards ... bastards ... crotch monsters ... your mom? Well, whatever it was, you're defintely still 'it' today for not posting.  Bastards.

      Well, it wouldn't suck so much if I weren't stuck here with this one guy. I'd hate to have to re-populate the world with him. I can't stand ugly people. They make me feel so...so... oh I don't know, they just give me the creeps. I just had a funny thought. Whenever I say I don't like someone and someone asks why, I'll say cause they're ugly. I'm not really that mean. Just thought it would be funny to say. Not funny? Oh well. But someone post something...  Tammy, how's work and class scheduling going? Robin, tell us about the hot guy with the body at work. Nikol, how are the boys and how was the wedding? Tracybacon, how's work and everything? Maria, oh sweet Maria.  I have this problem with Maria. See, she's not a drinker. She's in Wisconsin, and she's not a drinker. Don't comment Mike. That's just wrong on, like, a hundred and fifty different levels. She's leaving in a month and she's not even trying to build up her tolerance to alcohol. She doesn't understand why we drink to the point where we throw up...but what she doesn't realize is that this is a trial and error type of thing. You're not gonna do 10 shots of anything and expect to be somewhat sober, until you drink 15 shots of anything a couple of times and throw up. It's okay to drink and throw up if you're just trying to find your limit. But she's like 23. She's not getting any younger. We have to do something about this people.  Anyway, Maria, oh sweet Maria, comment allez-vous?  Well, you guys suck right now and you will all suck tomorrow too unless you post something. Nikol and I have been the only ones posting recently.  Rat bastards!!!

      Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there lived a beautiful maiden named Heather.  Heather lived in a ginormous castle...somewhere...Anyway, she lived there with her mother and father and her - an unknown number to none - siblings.  They were a nice family, all good and Christian-like, in a good way it seems.  Then, one day this guy named Mike came to their castle.  Mike had some reeeeally big ears.  I'm talking huge.  And they stick out... I mean stuck out.... really far from his head.  And it was funny too, because at one time, when he had long hair, he would tuck it behind his ears.  That's not a very pretty image is it?  Well, it got funnier because then Mike SHAVED HIS HEAD!!!  That was a funny day.   Well, anyway...they got married and lived happily ever after.  And are expecting their first child or children really, really soon.  I AM NOT BALD!!  I was having a rough time...with the stress...you know, the stress, it's not good...I was stressed!!!  Damn it!!!!!  Talking bout people like he ain't got no sense.  That's why you got those big ass ears, cause you're mean!!!

      I DID IT!!!  I asked the stupid boy out!! Well, not really. I gave him my phone number and told him that he should call me if he wanted to hang out onetime. There was a lot of small talk this time. I intentionally continued to talk in hopes that something would come up and it did. I told him that since he's never been to the cafe that I'd have to take him one day (yeah I said that!!) and he said that would be fun. And then we just talked about other stuff and I said hey, I'm gonna take initiative and say here is my number call me.... So, we'll see what happens next. He's cute and funny. And he doesn't seem to be a partier. But he said something that made me think he wasn't as conservative as I thought he was. He seems like a good guy. And he think I'm beauTiful. That's not the only reason I like him Robin!! I thought he was cute before that, but then I was like, okay where am I??, there's no way. Who knows, maybe he'll call, maybe he won't. Suck if he didn't, just a little though. I'm happy I did it though.  Well, my brother and I looked at an apartment today. We liked it. The landlord thought we were cool and appreciated us telling him that we had shitty credit. We'll see how that goes. My brother and I both applied to work at Gilligan's. It's attached to Rain. New patio bar with a beach and waterfall. We'll see how that goes too.  I'm really hoping everything works out okay. Not just us getting the job and apartment, but I hope that we are able to maintain everything. I think we will be able to. I'm not being a child right now. I know people are probably thinking that I'm rushing in to this moving thing like I always do. But I'm not. I've been thinking about it for almost a year. I need to do what's right for me. I don't really want to wait until it's safe. I don't want to miss out on this. I don't plan on staying in wisconsin forever. I don't even plan to finish college here. The sooner I'm able to adjust to living on a budget and all that other stuff that comes with being independent the better. I'm going to do this. If I fail miserably I hope everyone who thought that I would feels guilty as shit because this is so not a matter of knowing me and how I am. I just wish I didn't have to ask people to be happy for me.  Back to good.

      And I'm hungry.  My car gets out of the shop on friday.  Yippee!!  I could have picked it up today, but I'm working a double shift.  It's not too bad at work.  I haven't had the aching desire to run away....yet.  I hate the stupid boy now.  Bastard.  I was talking to Tammy the other day-- if I ever say that I was talking to someone and then just go on an out of this world rant...it's safe to assume that the someone I talked to was Tammy-- and we thought it would be funny if I went in angry and yelled at him for not calling me, when I was sitting by the phone expecting his call.   ***Not really what happened!!!  I was expecting, but not sitting by the phone!  It's routine.  He calls me and compliments me and I say the dumbest things possible and giggle...a lot.  That how it goes, man.  But he fucked up the rotation!  Anyway, we thought that would ensure that he wouldn't ask me out.  That way...here comes the logic...I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.  It will just be over and done with.

      My car still isn't ready.  I won't be charged the fee for fixing this because it's there fault.  Okay so, it's safe to say that had they put everything in right the first time and not dropped my starter, I would have had my car on monday.  Now I'm not getting it until tomorrow...if all goes well.  The one thing that seriously pissed me off was that they put the same chick on the phone that I talked to yesterday.  This woman had absolutely no idea what she was talking about.  None what so ever.   You know what I love?  Nip/Tuck.  Great show.   I'm not looking forward to going to work.  So, not.  I hate my job.

      My car was s'posed to be ready on friday.  But it wasn't.  Then on Monday, but it wasn't.  Then on Tuesday, but it wasn't.  Now, I'm wondering if it's going to be fixed today.  Today marks week three of my car being in the shop.  Isn't that funny?  I didn't think so either.  I can't even remember what the problem was on friday, but on monday it was that they dropped the starter and had to replace it but it wasn't going to be dropped off until tuesday.  Tuesday, they had put the starter on, and of course replaced the engine, but the car was still running rough.  Hmmmmmmmmmm.  I took the car in because it was running rough.  They said if I got the whole fucking engine replaced, it would stop.   It didn't stop.  What would your first thought be?  Kevin, oh sweet kevin.  Well he told me that the car wasn't making any noise anymore so the problem was the engine.  Well, now they don't know why it's running rough, but they are keeping it to find out why.  And I should have it today if all goes well.  I think that's there motto.  If all goes well.  Bastards.

      After 25 minutes of careful consideration I've come to the conclusion that it would be very feasable for me to move to Whitewater.  My main reason for moving to Milwaukee is to be closer to school, while moving to Whitewater completely defeats that purpose...it adds another possibility.  I went to uww.edu and checked out the theater department, I wanted to see if it would be worthwhile to transfer, but it's not.  The tuition is like $2000 more than uwm.  I'm exaggerating, but it's in the 4somethings and uwm is 2977 including this year's increase.  Plus, I'm on academic probation and I just don't want to take the chance of not being able to pay for it.  So, I wont transfer.  But, luckily for me, this semester wouldn't have been that bad, because I only have two days of classes starting before noon.  So, I'd have plenty o' time to workout in the morning on any day and still make it to class on time.  But then I run in to the same problems: either I don't feel like driving to school or I drive there and realize I really don't want to be there, then turn around and come back home.  I just thought that instead of pushing myself to go everyday, I could just move to milwaukee and being so close, I wouldn't have any reason not to go.   So okay, let's list the pros and cons of moving to ww vs. milw. Pro:  Nikol is there. Con:  It's further away from school than Racine. Pro:  It's rent free in exchange for babysitting. Con:  That one doesn't really matter because my place in milw would be paid for with my student loan. Pro:  Even if I do pay rent, I wouldn't have to fork out my entire loan just to pay rent upfront (bad credit...long story).  I could use the left over to pay bills.  That counts as 2 pros. Con: My brother. Pro:  He's not my CHILD!!! Con:  But he's my brother!!!  And what about my babies!!!  That counts as 2 cons!!! Pro:  When they come to visit they'd have Trast and Ayden (did I spell that right) to play with.  Con:...  Pro:  Plus, instead of being in plays in milw, around other students that I'd see everyday, I could (if allowed) audition in ww and not be as self concious.  I'd rather audition around strangers.   milw vs. ww: Pro:  Closer to school. Con: Entire loan check toward rent depending on whether or not I move with a roomie or with my brother or alone. Pro:  Save money in gas. Con:  My brother... Pro:  not my child. Con:  still my brother. Pro:  I think, not quite sure, but I think milw has a few more bars than ww.  Higher possibility of finding a great paying bartending job.  Counts as half a pro cause my odds of finding a job increases, but it doesn't necessarily mean I'll find a GREAT job. Con:...  ww 7 pros 5 cons  milw 4 pros 3 cons  we all know that staying in racine would be more like whitewater.  but, my brother would like to stay in racine, I don't really want to.  I think I just want to leave racine.  I think I was born to be a rolling stone.   this is the bottom line.  If I do decide to move to whitewater I would see what it's like commuting first semester and I'd have to find a job before I moved there.  same for milwaukee and same for racine.  most importantly, I'd have to see what my brother wants to do, because in this case, his well being is my first priority.  I want to make sure he is good before I decide to just move some place else without him.  as stupid as some may think that is, fuck you.  he's my brother and if I was only living for myself there would be no point of living.  either way, I'm moving.
