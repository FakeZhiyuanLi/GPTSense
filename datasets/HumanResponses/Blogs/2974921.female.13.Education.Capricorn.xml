      i'm talking to a new friend of mine. his name is jammi[cute no?]. he's from ahs and a poetic musician. i like talking to him. there's no romance just friendship. this is the kind of friend whose a guy i want.  dayrl and i haven't spoken to each other again. i miss her. i just hate it when she acts all gloomy around me while she acts so happy around the others. it's vey offending. maybe i just find it so because once i'm gloomy around her, i'm angry to everyone else. mean, huh? hey, it's me. no lies...the first truth i ever said about me.  earlier this morning, mrs. franco cried in front of us. i couldn't blame her after she was backstabbed by our ever-so-epal classmate, danielle. someone, more like some peole spilled out her secrets. secrets like how she curses mrs. franco behind her back. like those secrets of hers about having someone else do the work for her. man, i've seen her on the verge of tears a lot but seeing her in tears now is simply shocking. mrs. franco is a strong person so i find it bothering.  well, i felt guilty afterwards..about ms. dela peña.i've always been talking behind her back but who could blame me and the other fifty students doing the same thing? i'll do it anyway so i don't have to be sorry. she deserves it anyway.

      i'm so tired...  physically,i mean. i spent half the day in school working on the annual. then daryl won't speak to me. plus, i received another threat from yang saying she'll torture me if i become a staffer again next year. i had a bad day but i didn't even think of suicide once. actually, i'm pretty okay with it. i guess i've gotten used to bad things happening to me. sure, i don't have the happiest life, what's new?  anyway, i've decided i won't talk to lyle anymore. i just get in trouble. so it bye-bye cutie. bye..i didn't even get the chance to be loved by you. whatever! i probably never get the chance anyway.  i just wanted to blog this out because this is the first i'm not complaining much.  bahala na...

      i just read lyle's blog and all i could say is that i don't have a chance. man, i'm so desperate for a the wrong person...AGAIN. ano bang bago??? my brother was right, i'm the one chasing ugly people not the other way around which is supposed to be. did i just say lyle's ugly? nevermind that, it's something everybody calls "sourgraping". whatever.... he and yang are very much in love. he and yang are of the same age. he and yang have through a lot. compare that with this: me and lyle were not even close to aqcuaitance. i'm 4 years younger than lyle. lyle and i have a lot in common but what's that gonna do? man, i'm getting my feelings wasted all over AGAIN.  i never learn. i just live in this weird fantasy of mine while ignoring the fact that it just wasn't meant to be. he said opposites attract. opposites attract my ass. i'm not gonna fall for shit men[which are only two for the time being..were pala] tell me. hey, i've been with guys years older than myself. no wonder i grew up to be a stupid complement to men. i've been fooled too many times. i guess i really should just wait for my time.  but, hey, i could always keep my little fantasy that maybe lyle does like me. nah, that's too big. maybe he liked my "kiss". ah, that's more like it.   man, i've wasted too many weeks missing him. he has his own life so he can't always talk to me. i've got my own life, too...that was meant only for him. KIDDING!!  bahala na...talaga...

      someone passed away today...  katrina villaroman was reported dead early this morning. i don't know her personally but i see her around. even if i'm not her friend, i feel kinda sad for her death. first, she was a batchmate of ours. second, she was a good person[according to many]. lastly, it was a shame she didn't even make it to the graduation. it's kinda creepy how the things happening in school are giving way to this event. i first "vibed" it when jonela brought her rosary by mere coincidence. turns out we were going to pray the rosary that day. then an article in the magazine which was to fill one page got lost. it kinda made way for out tribute to katrina. maybe it was...meant to be.  it makes you realize how short life is when someone almost close to you passes away. i heard from mara it was a hit and run case for katrina. i wonder if anyone would stop for me if they hit me. i realized that i really do have to be careful because i could die anytime. but, hey, it was [please katrina don't haunt me for this] kinda her and her friends fault. according to the story they were sneaking out with another excuse so they could get their parents' permission. and they only had their driver's supervision. makes you think, everyone's responsible for their time.  man, i almost asked daryl what she would think if i died. i didn't ask anymore because[many says] when i say it, it might actually happen.  i wonder what hell is like? i'll probably go there anyway. maybe it's like our living world. they say hell is chaotic. i think our world would be much more chatic than hell so if that's the case, yeah, i'd rather be in hell..  bahala na!

      i wonder why God is testing my loyalty to my friends these days...  just yesterday i received this letter from my ex-kabarkada, stef. she's still my friend but we sort of drifted apart. she told me i looked happy with daryl...very. it was like she was saying i made this choice so she and ayen had no choice but to accept it. she wrote that they think i was happy because i said it saw for the best but my temporary "boy craziness" and era piercing weren't so good. i am aware of that! she said she missed me and hoped the 3 of us could hang out sometime. she even wanted a reply. i'm still thinking of how to tell her to just...move on. i want to say that even if we'd hang out, things won't just fall into their right places but it wouldn't hurt to try.  then daryl wrote to me,too,that same morning. she said she's sorry for not being the best friend there is.she also apologized for not being able to make me happy like how my "ex-best friends" did[not true!]. it came to me as if she and stef talked about how they were going to write to me. the two letters were so similar. they were about my faltering friendship with stef and ayen.  sometimes i think daryl and i are too sweet with the hugging and pet names. but i'm sure i'd miss that sweetness if it was taken away[God,no!]. i just think that it may be hurting stef and ayen...should i say jealous? i do miss the two but i've moved on[somehow] and i hope they have, too. for once, i made a decision for my self and not for myslef plus everybody else[selfish,huh?]. but then, the "heroic" side kicks in every once in a while. i even lose myself in thinking that maybe daryl and i weren't... i don't even wanna say it.  besides, it seems that ayen is avoiding me[i think]. stef's got her own life. both of them have gained good friends unlike the "rebelious me". they're happy, at least i think so. we did gain new friends but somehow lost each other. it was like what ayen said back in 4th grade. she said if i left the 'kada, everyone would drift apart. i didn't believe it back then but now i strongly do. i "left" the 'kada so ayen and stef could hang out more since ayen felt left out. now i'm happy ang regretful of that decision. happy because i found daryl. regretful because stef and ayen drifted apart. i wanted them to be closer but the opposite happened. i wonder, what would've happened if ayen never said she felt left out and we would never have fought? nah, i can't blame her. it was my fault....it always is...  **** i hope daryl never finds out what i think about her and her boyfriend,nick. frankly, i think it's all a joke. i know what love is not, being so sure you love someone in 10 days. though it's painful, it's brutally obvious that nick is playing with her. sweeping her off with cute quotes and 'i love you's. love is built on trust. how can daryl trust nick if they haven't even met.[man, i sound like my parents] well, she said she was only playing with him but it looks like she's the one being played with. i just can't tell this to daryl. first of all, she's so excited about this that i'd kill myself if ever ruined her happiness. secondly, i committed the same mistakes before so she'll think i'm being a bitch[girl thing]. thirdly, she didn't discourage me when i first met JP. i just can't..  being a good friend[according to majority] is being a good influence and driving yourself and acquantance away from harm's way. nick, surely, is bad news. so, i have to protect daryl from him. either i tell her "take it easy" or i tell her to cut the relationship short, she'll probably get...by me! but being agood friend is giving sound, truthful and reasonable advices. the best advice for now is, "daryl, nick isn't good for you." being a good friend is making your companion happy. nick is making her happy. my God, i'm so confused..  what if daryl will understand? what if she doesn't? there's only one way to know: tell her. maybe i should just shut up. is that being a good friend?  how much does it take to be a friend at least?  bahala na!

      Reality bites! Who ever said it didn’t? [Try Barbie!] I guess the Matrix saying is true. Life is less believable when it’s perfect. It’s too good to be true, in my case, to go through a week without getting in trouble or something. Besides, it’s way too boring if life is plain and simple. Who wouldn’t want a little twist of adventure? But what if it twists a lot that you crack? It’s scientifically [and psychologically] proven that human is weak by nature. Therefore, being weak, we are easily driven into madness. True?? Duh!  Even I, from a seemingly almost perfect family, with honors, friends and I touch of popularity; fall into the darkest pits of life every once in awhile. I remember going through those days when everything seemed to fall apart. Man, did they suck. First, I get caught of my hidden agenda. Bam! I ended up with no cell phone, no phone rights, a guilty conscience and “Family traitor” branded on my forehead. Next, Daryl and I fought for a week and I ended up being melancholic all over and spreading the bad vibe to everyone whom I come across. Then there were those times when I was pressured about the magazine, my studies and my well being. Everybody was just forcing me to be perfect from him or her. I felt like a real life puppet. Those days brought much pain, sorrow, hopelessness but at the same time, many important lessons. Those days, I went mad. I lost every drop of sanity in me. I snapped and totally lost control of everything… and… I kinda… liked it. [Hey, I'm no Hulk!]  Since I'm human, I'm weak. I'm proud to be actually. In that way, people won’t expect too much from me and I can prove to all that I'm perfectly imperfect. Yeah, anyway, as I said, I'm weak… and young and crazy. So when I get nervous breakdowns, I tend to get all suicidal and stuff. One time, our CL teacher called me out. She said I wasn’t paying attention. That was for two reasons: 1) I find CL very boring [no offense], 2) I was staring out the window. I was wondering what it would be like to soar downwards and walk to the next life. I even had this insane debate in my head about whether the third floor was high enough to kill me immediately. Being poetic, I also wrote some poems about it. I even went as far as writing a death note. Freaky? Shallow? Almost practical.  Now, I still am weak. I look back to those days when I was stupid [still am!] and realize I’ve matured in a way. Before, I was scared to face the painful reality but now I just think of it as another assignment I have to work on. Now I know what I would’ve missed if I committed murder with one fateful jump. I also learned that no matter how gruesome our problems are, it’ll always be solved… always. No one has the right to become negative all over just because of a problem it’s not like you have a terminal disease or something.  Well, that’s enough foolish banter for now.  I wonder what’s it like to be loved? Just wondering…  Bahala na!

      "hey" hello, i missed you... "you're going here?" yep, can't wait... "screw them" yeah, screw them... "i'm always attracted to girls with glasses" "you're just saying that" i hope not... "i think i'm in love" i am... with you... "you're so wise" anytime, my friend... "so i'm the 'normal' guy in this fucked up school(sorry for the swearing)" aww... "i'm the opposite of your statement" "opposites attract" yeah, they do... "i'm telling you, don't be" ok, i won't rebel... "move in with me" sure..."apartment or house?" any, as long as i'm with you... "now we have a lot in common" i hope so... "yeah" such a simple answer gives so much affirmation... "i feel so special" because you are...  it's almost been a day since i read his last message and i still feel this weakening adrenaline running through my veins. i feel so good to gain a friend and, at the same time, realize that love is sweeter the second time around. it's been five months since i last saw him and yet, there we were, talking as if we knew each other well. i know it's wrong but should i stop it? hell no!  could it be that mariah carey's "butterfly" says the truth? [that if something is meant to be, it will come back.] i also have this strong feeling that we'll see each other again. in a few years, are plans[which, i think, are mostly jokes] may be fulfilled. it's a scary thought to fall in love again after what i've been through. it could be dangerous, painful and simply "nonsense". but as they say "it's better to have loved than to never have loved at all.  bahala na...

      i can't belive what i got myself into this time........  well, needless to say, i got caught..again. what's new? turns out, mommy's bitching about my picture with jammi lead to tito cocoy's berserk mode. he went mad exactly like the last time. this time it was worst, my bro was there. whatever. so i don't have anyone to team up with at home. it happened before and i didn't die. i could do this. bad thing is, my bro isn't talking to me. i don't know why but i'm really worried.  goddammit! i told daryl about my "i love you" incident with jammi. what the hell, she's my best friend anyway..i think....  i can't believe that kuya mico and paula are a couple. this is some news!  well, the other day, i said good-bye to jammi. i even shared my "one year quarantine" plan with him. and i told him i do love him, unfortunately, over the net. later that night, he called me. and i told him that things weren't so bad after all. he didn't have to wait for a year [yes!] and i whispered the most awaited and stupidest thing i couldever blurt out, "i love you, baby". but, hey, it was worth it.   we still haven't talked and i miss him.  i'm still waiting for my folks to call. i'm wondering how they'd react to this.

      man, i feel so sick. i wanna cry...but over the net? who the hell am i kidding? jammi's not for me. so much for falling in love..  i feel so guilty of hurting jammi. that was the least i want to do but now it seems clear to me. at some point, maybe mariz is still in love with jammi that's why she's blackmailing him. and maybe jammi still cares for her but he's forcing himself to me so he'd forget mariz. i get it! this is some fucked up novel-like story. me and mariz's new boyfriend are just obstacles in the couple's love affair.  god, i feel like crying...i don't know what to do next.....after blowing off jammi like that....  i'm damn right...this too freakin' good to be fucking true......  back to being a hopeless romantic.......

      i had a blast yesterday! tito cocoy brought us to libis to play badminton for an hour. gosh i had a good time exercising. i didn't become tired right away, only after it. my right armwas kinda weakened but now it hurts[but not that much] and my butt[?]. but still i had fun. i didn't find any cuties to secretly oggle over but still had a great time. earlier that day, we went to SM to buy rackets for kuya and i. tito cocoy got a facial afterwards so kuya and i bonded. gosh, i can't believe how nice he has been to me. we chatted as we walked around. he even told me why the AHS and MC friendship bridge got closed and we finished the arcade Time Crisis II for the first time. man, i had a good time with him. last night was even weirder. he was so nice to me that he insisted we share beds. he even kind of leaning on me as we listened to his rock cd. it was like...maybe he wanted me to talk about something......  last night was also very scary. my parents called and, yes, i asked them if jammi and i could talk over the phone. it freaked me out when mama's voice lowered a little and she said in the most professional tone, "hold on". she even asked why we needed to talk to jammi over the phone.man, i was dumbfounded...

      gosh, everything is happening so fast i can't figure out what i should be feeling. maybe, everything is at its right pace but i'm way too overwhelmed that my mind has reached point of constant lapses. or maybe...i'm just so in love....i think...  i can't believe what jammi and i have been talking about. i have never been so tensed and relaxed at the same time when talking about the stuff we talk about. but sometimes, i winder if he's just tricking me. maybe he was just nice at first so gullible me would trust him and we could talk about those stuff. but sometimes i'm so sure that maybe he's really serious or he's approaching this really cautiously.   i'm having fun in this "relationship". i get the respect i need and i think i am making him happy somehow. we're taking things nice and slow, which is a good thing for since it was so fast with JP that i never experienced those long thrilling periods others go through. i feel so regretful of JP. if i didn't get involved with him then Jammi could've been my first guy friend, first love....first kiss...first boyfriend....  yesterday was a day of shocking revelations. i found out a lot about him. some were disappointing, some were funny. all the same, he was understanding of my revelations. i confessed to him about JP and he took it well just as well as i took his confession. i told him about my situation. i had no complete freedom. we even got to the point of talking about "what if" my parents need to meet his, or my folks may get the impression he's courting me. gosh, i was so giddy.......  his dream was the coolest part..................hehehe...giddy again......

      i was so irritated with daryl yesterday. i was telling her something and she was in her "not in the mood" realm and was kinda attempting to pull me in. i hate it when she says she's okay when it's obvious she's not. she always says that she hates lying. well, she is! right in front of me! i don't feel like i can be open to her anymore.  hehe..i can be open to my parents, i guess. wow, i guess i do love them..

      what do you say when someone you like says, "i'm falling for you." me? i just freak out....heheh..  there has been this sparky attraction between jammi and i since the beginning but we just take our relationship easy. we're something like "more than friends but not quite lovers" [is that right?] but yesterday, that changed...big time. jammi and i were talking about something then our conversation landed on...[ehem, ehem]...touching ourselves. he approached it very cautiously and respectfully. anyway, he asked me something i didn't understand well [why does he have to be so smart?] and then we got cut off. when we chatted again, we both agreed we'd be open to those topics since neither of see any point why we shouldn't. i also admitted being a bit offended by his question earlier. that's when we had fun with the YM emoticons. we were trying to figure out which emoticon suited us. that was fun....  then we got into speaking deep tagalog for fun. i was so giddy because i always found old romantic things very...um...romantic. here's what kept me up all night with a hanger-wide smile plastered across my face:  he said he wanted to tell me something but i shouldn't freak out. so i said it was okay since i thought it was something about him. but it was about us...about me...he said:  "i'm falling for you"  needless to say, i freaked out. i wasn't able to reply for a while. too much mixed emotions surged through my bones too quickly i lost myself. there was joy, relief, shock [a lot of that], doubt and giddiness. being a total klutz, i asked him if he was sure. the answer i got was beyond perfect. he said he liked me more and more each day. something like that. he asked if i didn't want him to, again, being a klutz, i said i did. but there are circumstances. what i meant was i don't have total freedom to love. gosh, at that time, nothing else mattered....just the moment itself......  later, he asked me if i wanted to meet his ex. jammi explained that Mariz, his ex, became conceited after their break-up. she was telling all her friends that jammi wanted her back and was courting her. it came to me, maybe mariz got so hung up on jammi's TLC that she's doing these stuff because she missed him. anyway, jammi wanted to teach her a lesson and he wanted me to do him a favor. i did, i pretended to be his girlfriend! i was wishing with all my might that that would someday be true. in the conference where i met mariz, jammi and i were calling each other "hon" and "baby". gosh, both of us were extremely giddy. only after about 3 messages from mariz, she left. after a while, i did, too.  nyt nyt, jammi...  and here i am.....  gosh, i feel like i'm dreaming....^_^

      gosh, i feel so guilty about ranting about my own stupid life. they're right, you shouldn't comlain about your problems because someone out there will always have a bigger problem than you...or something. i can't believe i've been whining for so long when i should be glad that heaven, hell and earth are fallingdown on me like a landslide. i'm lucky both my parents are my real parents. i'm glad i don't have an ex who will try out suicide. i'm thankful i don't live in front of a pool with out-of-tune people sing all day long. i'm thankful i have someone with me.  i read the cosmo mag[i duno if i'm allowed to.] a few hours ago and it started sinking to me that men really do talk. it was said there that girls should let the guys talk to attract them or something. i know jammi isn't the "following the herd" type so i don't know if i attract him by letting him do most of the talking. but, i guess there's a "deeper" meaning to it. i mean, when i talk to daryl, it's always me talking. and when i realized that i'm learning to listen because of my chats with jammi, i started feeling kind of guilty for being so darn talkative. that should be one of the things i should change in high school. i remember mae giving me this folder with proverb-like stuff and in front was written, "to talk is a skill, to listen is an art". wow, hit me pretty hard.  i also read the good housekeeping mag and it was said there that teens tend to lose themselves when they're in love. i guess, it's the same for me. i haven't talked long to my friends lately because i'm always in the internet. is it really my fault? am i obligated to call them? i know i should be doing it out of the goodness of my heart, but the problem is, there's no more goodness left in me. heehee...... my life was never "almost perfect"... at least from what i see and feel. my classmates always said i was the girl nearest to perfection. i have a good family, i excel in school, i'm pretty, i can handle situations and i am loved by all. i feel like throwing up whenever they assume i'm living a perfectly happy life. because i'd rather live a life where i struggle in school, my family's broken into pieces, i look ordinary and where nothing much is expected of me. sure, every once in a while, i'd love my life and never wish to trade it with someone else's. but the problem is, when i get used to the feeling of perfection, i get bored with it. meaning, i'm bored with my own life.  i hated it when i easily understood stuff in school. i was supposed to be challened in there but instead, i'm only fed with information i already know or lessons as easy as addition. im not really loved by all, no one is. by many, maybe, but definitely not all. when i fight with daryl, obviously, she doesn't love me. when i'm being a total klutz, i bet my brother wishes i was never born. sure, my parents love me, my friends, my teachers, my family do. but it hits me, do they love me or are they only obligated to do so. maybe loving is an obligation so maybe at some point it's not spontaineous. but if love is everybody's obligation then i guess it's not really a matter of discusiion anymore.honestly, i can't handle situations. they think i do because i don't break out and cry...in front of them. i do. when work at the theresian mag was getting out of hand, i would run to the restroom and have a long nervous breakdown. whoever said crying doesn't help is wrong. it does, a lot. it helps you relax and you tend to think more clearly when you do. i don't know about anyone else but crying works for me.  sometimes i wish i was in a different school. so then, i can start over. i could lay low, i could build a new laid-back personality. but that would be running away and leaving the things i started undone. sometimes i wish my own parents would only let me be myself. i wish they would tell me to do my best and aim for perfection. i wish they'd be satisfied with an ordinary daughter. when i grow up, i don't want to be put up in a high position right after i graduate. i want to work hard to attain that "greatness". then i'd feel more satisfied and i would know i really worked hard for it. sure, i may have worked hard for it in college, but then it would be unfair that i only had to work hard in a protected environment.   i wonder if my parents would just throw me out into the real world. i would like that. i would learn by experience. i would learn by example. i would learn on my own.  heheh, that's a lot!

      i remember my parents telling me falling in love was caring for someone so much. so, i guess...maybe..at some point, i am in love.  jammi was so sweet to send me an e-card with a poem of his. i feel so good yet undeserving. i mean, me, a "player" to him, a good guy? i'm gonna do my best to make this work. i feel so...uh..shall i say, blessed? i'm too inspired to write. ust wanna blog out how happy i am.

      wow, the UG community isn't so bad. they actually gave me some good advices....very realistic,too.  they're right about raxzeez[or whatever his name is], i should just ignore him. i mean, for all i know, he's a 50-year-old scoring on chicks through the net. but he did have a friendster account which looked reall, but still, it is kinda gross to "fall in love" with someone 10 years younger than him. how much more if he was 17 years older? hehehe..i just remembered mhyko.....anyway, i shouldn't even be bothered by this. i could always ignore his messages. and, yeah, it was my fault to talk to him in the first place. man, it's like my parents never taught me not to talk to strangers.  those UG guys were also right about lyle...i think. i should just ignore him. well, he isn't talking to me so i have no problem with that. but i can't just talk to yang [man, she'll kill me!] but i just can't igore that. maybe i will. so what if i live a nightmarish high school, they'll probably grow tired of me. but....i think i should apologize to him. he did tell the truth and i lashed out on him. my God, alex, just let it go.  i was so kilig yesterday! jammi and chatted but, unfortunately, just for a while. still, i never felt so nice. he's boyfriend material. he respects me, he's sweet, good profile and he seems like a nice and talented guy. gosh, *blush,blush*..heehee.....  going back to the UG guys....they're totally right. i'm 13 and i should just be chillin' out [in this climate, no way!], getting fresh air or something. i'm young and i feel like i'm too ahead of my time. why am i even bothering about my love life? i'm so excited about it that i miss those stuff i should be enjoying while i'm 13. and i really need to step into reality. my own world's like smoking. so soothing yet so addicting and destructive. besides, i'll probably hook up with decent guys when i grow up. i mean, that way, i really would enjoy it. i guess i should engage myself in something else for now. like music, poetry, or something like that. hahaha!one of them[UG guys] said, "don't your parents know how naughty you've been." hahah!no, they don't. that makes my sins even more "to die for"[for my, a rebel's, opinion]  well, i guess i have some mind-clearing to do. i have to clean my head of lyle and raxzeez, of the negative things i learned, of the pain i have been feeling, my God! from all the drama coming out of me!

      gosh, there are so many things i wanna do this summer. suddenly, i'm so interested in learning different things. well, i'm already gonna take up karate and i want to take guitar lessons. i also wanna learn how to skate. maybe i could also take swimming lessons, i mean, i'm already 13 and i still don't know how to swim. how pathetic am i? maybe i should take up those algebra classes kuya attended before he entered high school. i do suck in math big time so it may be of help. i even want to take dance lessons in the school nearby. that was my first choice by the way. but of course, i can't take them all because, face it, we're not rich. it's just because i feel like a loser around my classmates who excel in other things besides school. that's the only thing i'm good at..and complaining. well, being good in school alone automatically makes me a dork. cool...i'm a pretty dork...whatever...  well, i guess i'll just take karate and maybe guitar[sana! i really want to!]. but come to think of it, i think i'm only interested in learning how to play the guitar because jammi knows how to. whatever, an extra skill won't hurt. but that's kinda like peer pressure isn't it? well, even if it is, i'm pretty used to it so what's the difference if i gave in to this one? at least i like this unlike the work i had to do back in gr6.  "back in gr6"....gosh, i can't believe i'm already a graduate of the grade school. it's been almost a month and i still can feel the uneasiness of change. i get the feeling it isn't really that bad. everybody's shocked of sudden change. like going to a new country. you'll be an ignorant stranger to a whole new realm like you were just born. it bites a lot that when i was starting to have a blast with my classmates, that's when we depart. what is scaring me more is that everyone else seems to be moving on except me. i feel like my skills are up to this point and no more. it's like i'm forever a 12-year-old and they're all turning 14. i've been noticing it with the lame poems i wrote recently. i dunno if i'm just out of inspiration or i just really suck at it or some students really are better than me. when i think of the last reason, it makes me realize how boastful and proud i am. wow, like that's new.....anyway, i'm just not satisfied with what i write so i don't write anymore. i dunno why i'm not inspired on top of all the things that has been happening to me. i want to write something metaphorical like the works of shakespeare although i haven't read his works, those of which i've heard sounded interesting because he mixed things up but still made sense. unlike typical me,. a very literal "poet".   "it makes me so sad, i feel so uninspired....."-bic runga [sway] this is the perfect song for me.   man, if i was talking this out to a friend, that person would've walked outta me on the second paragraph. i sure talk a lot....write a lot.by the way, i plan to change [and may God help me on this]. i want to be stronger, in terms of emotion. i cried a lot this year so i need to work on that. i need patience. my patience can only last 20 minutes and there's a lot of work in high school so i really need that. i should work on my wisdom. not that i have any....wrong, i should work on my practicality. gosh, i really need to focus on that. honesty should've been first. because i am a big fat liar. lastly, i need to work on my social skills. especially, my relationships. my God, if daryl and i fight over the same issues again, i'll snap! i'm actually more relaxed now a days because daryl  much" and "i miss you". i think that's why we fought easily, because we were too sweet. but those were the good times.... yeah, i miss those. but i'm also kinda happy that it's gone...sort of...ahh! i'm so Goddamn confused.  whoa...i've been "swearing" a lot lately...in my blog, i mean.........whatever..... maybe I should try thinking deeper the next time I write. You know, have my own philosophies and theories about stuff. Maybe having my own words for stuff will make me a little more unique…not that any one can be more unique….kinda hard to say but easy to understand. And maybe if people would here a side of me with more depth, they’d see that my “beauty” is not only skin deep.[ooh, gotta work on that one, too]. Hey, it sounds like jammi’s got a fan. Me! Is it me or am I trying to be like jammi? First guitar lessons then the “deep thing”. Hahahahaha……that can be a good laugh….jammi’s crush[oh, I so wish for that!] is his fan. Eewww…..fan sounds gross. Admirer sounds better. Come to think of it, it’s the same! Whatever!  Man, this heat is driving me mad! I can’t believe how much I’ve written. Well…that’s enough foolish banter for now. There’s always next time to whine about my stupid life. How much more when we go abroad?? Oh my God! I’m gonna end up in “crapland”!......good…wahehehe….

      so much for an ultra kilig summer. everyday, i end up in an oven hot corner of the house, surfing the internet, totally bored. i end up feeling so cruel at night. somehow, i lost myself. man, i overdid cruelty....  i wonder if mistakes really are irreversable. i wonder if a person really could forgive and forget. i wonder if they're still angry at me. i wonder what will happen if i just ignore it. i mean, raxzeez, or whatever his name is, in malaysia. lyle's in america and jammi's in marikina. God, i wonder why i feel so confused.  lately i've been thinking....you know, about out of this world stuff. like my principles[i have few], nations' beliefs, human reactions. it's slowly coming to me that maybe we're all link with somethng inside us. something like an inner self. it's not exactly a feeling but more of a state of being.   shit, what the hell am i saying?? this heat is driving me nuts...........  i can't help worrying about stuff. more like boys. yeah, i admit, i am boy crazy but i keep it to a minimum. hah! nice joke of mine! anyway, raxzeez is pissed off, lyle said, "pls don't hate me" and jami hasn't been on-line. my God, this internet is bringing me headaches......and heartaches as well. it's not really the internet's fault. duh it's a thing. it's my fault....always is.....  aha! i just found out another stupid fact about me. i blame other people for my dumb mistakes. see, i blamed lyle. i blame the internet. dammit, i even blame my own parents. i know in reality, which is outside my weird fantasy land, there's only thing to blame. God? i wish....no, it's me. duh! every person is responsible for his own actions. that's kinda like one the basic things in life. right? right!  aaugh....i am so disgusted of myself. i lie a lot. it's a bad habit. even worse than my nail biting. besides being a big fat liar, i'm a complete idiot. i fool others and end up fooling myself.   i wonder why i'm so...like this today. must be because of that message i recieved from this weird guy...or girl. s/he emailed me saying, "do you know yourself? be real...." it was really creepy and i don't think it's a spam because my email add has spam guard on it. but hey, whoever you are, thanks.   i guess i can't say "bahala na" because it does no good. like me! maybe i should say it....wahahaha...whatever....  i wonder what's it like die....maybe it isn't so bad..you know, you'll be put out of your misery but it's running away from your stuff. maybe if i don't eat and die of hunger, it won't be suicide. stupid me, of course it is.   "angels are embodiments of love. they cannot love."-jammi i don't understand it. but i guess finding out would give me a litte deep thinking to do.   oh Divine Inspiration, why have you stopped blessing me?.....hahaha........how corny.....

      i'm so bad...and in love............kinda nice, i must admit......  i lied to raxzeez, or whatever his name is, about my rudeness. i said it wasn't me. it's just that he said he was disppointed with me and i was affected by that. do i really care? i don't know.....  jammi and i had a great conversation yesterday. i found out he's a really deep person. he says stuff no ordinary 15-year-old would think of. his theories and opinions makes me feel like i'm so ignorant. it seems like he looks at things so thoroughly and he thinks wel of them. i really find him interesting.....charming and sweet. we chatted the whole morning, unfortunately, i wasn't able to get backat him after my lunch because my bro used the computer. isaid i'll be back, i wonder if he's mad. i also found out a couple of things about him which were supposed to be secrets. he said he just felt like he could tell me anything. he said he trusted me and i did feel like i was trusted. well, jammi, i won't let you down[oi, rexona!].  anyway, he told me he was clairvoyant. jammi told me it was really a dark side to him. he told me he dreamt ofhis grandfather's death and the presidential thing of FPJ. lately, he dreamt of a guy being shot. i felt kinda honored to be the first to know that. he also had a lot of theories. like when i asked him if he believed in ghost, he didn't really answer my question but told me that ghosts are passed on not created. you know, when genes and memories are passed on to other generations, the present get glimpses of the past, assuming they're ghosts. pretty deep, huh? he also told me he was born critical. oh and he sent me a sample of his beatboxing. wow, it rocked! i also told him about the time i fell from the second floor balcony, man, was he shocked. hahaha!  aww....i miss him....  bahala na....  it's been a while since i said that.....

      I am officially a very bad person…… no doubt about it. I totally am so mean and unforgiving…….oh my God, I’m a bitch……  I feel so guilty about Lyle yesterday. We chatted through YM and I was so rude. I kept cutting him and saying things that would let any idiot know that I’m angry at him. It was like I was blaming him for the rumors that had been around about me. I was blaming him that my high school life would be a living nightmare. I blamed him for everything….. Even if I didn’t want to. I know it’s not his fault because he said he didn’t lie about not having a girlfriend. Weird, huh? I just couldn’t help telling him. I don’t know. Maybe I’ve got issues, I always start fights. Anyway, I really felt bad when he said, “I do care” and I replied, “I’ve heard that too many times. They’re all the same….fakes” I felt even worse when he said, “Please don’t hate me” well... I don’t……. come to think of it, I think I still like you.  I felt even worse when I found myself being so mean to Jammi. I blew off the chance for us to talk. I disconnected because I was kind of upset because he was away for so long [shallow me]. We ended up talking that night. He was complaining about how his parents invite him to go out just so they could bond. He was reasoning that they could just bond at home. Good point…. We have the same problem…  Raxzeez, or whatever his name is, told me he loves me. I told him he’s crazy and he told me he’d be crazy…for me! What a cheesy pick-up line. I’m 13 but I’m not stupid. I told him I already have someone else in mind.   “someone else in mind” who? Jammi…..? or lyle?

      the past 2 nights have been some kind if mild milestone in my life. it had brought me closer to my family, to my friend and, fortunately, to my senses.  the other night, my brother and i were surfing the net late at night [about 10:45]. my YM was on-line when suddenly, someone sent me a message. oh my God! it was Lyle! i was shocked but i didn't let my brother see i was so shocked. i just told him to chat with Lyle since he wanted to. so, they did. i was reading their conversation and how he and Gian joked each other. i remember so well that Lyle inquired about me thrice. first was when he asked where was i. my brother told him i wasn't there[i told him to say that!] and when Lyle asked him where i was, he answered, "sa tabi ko[beside me]" oh boy, my sarcastic bro. next was when gian asked Lyle of his gimmicks, Lyle mentioned something about running away with me. nice.... last was when he said he was thinking of me. so sweet... i know he's just kidding then, but hey, it's still  kakilig    what am i saying? i like jammi now. he sent me a message the other day. he said he missed me so and that he will try to find out what happened with my YM the other day. he said his friend who had the 3-way line was itching to me,"jammi's girl". honestly, i like that but i said i wasn't sure with his proposal. i haven't talked to him in a while since he hasn't bee on-line lately.i don't know why i feel like i don't trust him. it's like i'm holding back. maybe...it's safe this way....  last night was fun! we watched my bro's graduation on the tape tito cocoy recorded. then we taped ourselves. it was so cool and funny! and i realized my voice was so weird. i don't know if i really talk that way or if i was just different that night. i also saw how nice our home looks like. very cozy.....  i've been chatting with raxzeez[i don't know his name] a lot lately. he's really coming on to me. saying it will take time for me to love him. whatever! i saw his picture on friendster and, man, i don't know how he got himself a girlfriend. he's really not my type and he looked old for his age. weird thing is, i kept having these sexy thoughts about him. i must be lonely.....hahahaha!!!!  bahala na.

      	It has been days since I last talked to the guy I thought I loved. My parents warned me not to talk to him anymore or else they’d kick me out but I know the real reason. I knew they were just protecting me from committing the mistake they did: marry early by accident. At first I rebelled against that because I really felt like I loved JP so much. Even if we only saw each other once and I really regret it because he wasn’t really handsome. I felt I loved him even if he studied in a bad school and obviously very poor. I know things like money and looks don’t matter in love but what about faithfulness? He was attached to someone else but he said he loved me. My dad was right. I was just excited because he was the first guy I’ve known.  	I blamed this mistake of falling hard for the wrong person to many. I blamed my parents because they kept me in the house, away from strangers that’s why I didn’t know how to fight my emotions. I blamed my school for only having girls that’s why I'm so excited around boys. I blame my best friend for not stopping me hard enough. Of course, I blame myself for being stupid. On top of my school honors, I was stupid. I guess I'm one of those people my teachers talked about, those I despised, and those who academically smart but in real life they were plain stupid. I was blind and I followed my heart too much. I was too proud that I thought I could hide my relationship with him.  	I didn’t stop talking to him right after my parents told me to stop. That loving feeling still stayed within. It was only a couple of weeks before my grade school graduation that I decided to cut my communication with him. It was because I realized that if loved him, I wouldn’t have told him so much lies that he knows nothing real about me. I knew that if I loved him, I would have improved instead of losing my honor in the second trimester of the school year. I knew that if he loved me, he would have broken up with his girlfriend.  	During the first week of permanent separation from him, I felt the strong urge to at least inform him that I don’t want to talk to him anymore. But I thought about it. We would probably go through the “I need you” s**t again. Even now, every once in a while, I miss him and I pick up the phone and dial the first three digits of his phone number. But then I won’t continue it because if I do, I’ll have to admit to the whole world that I'm beautiful but utterly stupid. At least now I could say proudly that I'm practical. I may lose one level in my rebellious personality but at least I'm still on the safe, heartbreak-free side of the world. And, hey, I could always break some other rule!

      a lot of things have happened lately. fights with daryl, graduation, grad party, meet up with jammi. i also learned a lot of things. let me list them down for you.  lesson1: be fair just a couple of days before grad, daryl was being a bitch on me again. you know, the typical "i don't care about you" syndrome kicking in. it was friday when i decided to apologize and it was the same morning she sent me an index card saying i was unfair to her. the usual "you're unfair" shit was laid out in front of me. i got fed up that i didn't talk to her anymore. later that day, i cried my heart out to my staffers while working on our annual [unprofessional, huh?]. i wrote this draft letter to daryl on the blackboard and she read it. the whole drama scenario took place and, you know, we're okay again.  lesson2: pay attention the wackiest and most embarassing moment happened on my grad day. i sang in advance because i wasn't looking at the conductor so i voiced out loudly. it was okay, i was the head-turner of the moment. i rocked!  lesson3: be optimistic i became an OS! i guess, when i say i can, i really can.  lesson4: take it easy i'm falling so hard for jammi. he's so cute and i'm really attracted to him. but my parents said i should take it easy. ok, i will.  lesson5: let them apologize daryl and i wnet to the grad party and swore never to leave one another. i promised that interms of life generalities. i mean, i won't leave her even if i get a bf or if we aren't classmates next year i'll still be her best friend. when jammi came, i hung out at martha's pad to rest because i had a headache and it happens that jammi was there. daryl thought i replaced her with jammi. i didn't apologize the next day because stef adviced me to give it time. the next next day, i called her and she was the worst bitch to me! i hung up and after that she asked me to call her again. she apologized but she should've been the one who called.   lesson6: someone's always better than me i'm a bitch,too, just like any other girl. but whose bitchier? daryl. i'm mean? she's meaner!  bahala na..

      where will ibe the day after tomorrow? [hahaha]  i had a great time with my grandma and my aunt the other day. they treated me and my brother out. first, we at this delicious pasta house named "napoli" somewhere in Timog. then we went to the mall and watched a movie called, " the day after tomorrow". it was about this climetologist father trying to get to his son in manhattan in the middle of a huge natural disaster. it was when the glaciers in the north and south poles started melting and it affected the oceans's currents and caused the freezing of the Northern Hemisphere. it was a great movie. it was scary as hell. i mean, it's not completely impossible for that to happen. and the bravery and heroism of the characters were admirable. plus, i learned hell of a lot of stuff.  1. never test nature.  i am now fully aware of what can and may happen years from now [my lifetime or not]. if we continue destroying mother nature, she'll destroy us. if not, we'll end up killing ourselves. i, for one, don't want to freeze to death so maybe it's a really good idea to take it easy with the massive consumption or resources.  2. humanity survives with hope, will and, sometimes, desperation. the reason why there were survivors is because they feared dying so they ran in frustration and panic. they ran their asses off to safety when half the globe was almost ending. they took fatal risks, stunts, hurried decisions and had their minds over matter because their will to live was so great. not only in that movie but in real life as well. people become who they want to be because their will to succeed was great. and they did something risky to fulfill that will.  3. unity is a big part of surviving.  there was a part in the movie where the americans had to evacuate south because the north was freezing. the mexicans didn't let them in because it would be illegal migration. most americans brought down the fences and just crossed the border illegally just to get to safety. later on, the us president offered the mexican government a deal of amnesty in exchange for refuge. so somekinda symbiosis kept poeple alive. the mexican's hospitality and the american's amnesty grant. there was a connection and an alliance made between the countries and it helped them in suviving.   4. believe sometimes, no matter how far-fetched soem ideas or promise are, we should give them the beefit of a doubt. nothing really is impossible. even if it's an end-of-the-world theory or a promise to walk 3000 miles to you in the freezing cold by foot, no idea is born without fact provoking it.  5. never watch a movie without a jacket. dammit! all the ice in the movie made me feel a lot colder than i already was.  *** i haven't to jammi in days now and i don't miss him. it's like it's normal. like we're just friends....just friends....he hasn't called anyway...

      how come poeple never question what is common? in a deeper sense that is. like life, why don't people question that? maybe it's because we've given up on trying to unlock its mysteries that we just decided to engage ourselves in trying to figure out stuff that could be calculated. let's face it, it's in our nature to stick to what's convenient instead of trying to think about deep and, as we assume, useless things. but if we never question life then obviously we don't know an answer to it, like what's its definition. that's kinda like knowing nothing about our own existance. isn't it a waste of time when we spend our lifetime serving the purpose we think is obligated to us. what if that purpose isn't reall our purpose? i mean, how would we know if we don't even know our reason of existance and life in the first place? how did we come to understand everything else when we find something so basic and common as life so hard to explain?

      this insecurity is getting to me. i can't be so happy when i talk to jammi fearing i'm not good enough to be like his superstar m.u. girl or his ex, mariz or his friends from MC, Assumption and Puveda. it's like my relationship with JP. except this time i'm the poor and idiotic one.  i love jammi but i don't know if he loves me. i do believe him but i'm not sure if he means it....

      One night, I was pleasuring myself when all of a sudden, I closed my eyes and that was something I don't usually do. It was so unbelievable! My body instantly relaxed and it felt even better. I guess, it proves that not everything should rely in sight. People have gown the mentality that beauty is the one that meets the eye[on top of all the "inside beauty" we talk about]. But what about how it feels? What about what we hear, smell, taste? Is there no beauty in that?   Another reason why people fear of being blind is because they would have to live in darkness. But, doesn't being blind have its advantages? Our other sense’s functions are heightened which means one will learn to appreciate one's environment better. One will learn how to see the finer details the eyes couldn't see. Besides, isn't it that the best things in life aren't always seen. Feelings aren't seen, the reactions are. People assume that feelings are the ways the body reacts to a specific thing. It’s kinda sad how people got used to judging other people or objects by their appearance. It is inevitable though. Who would want to hang out with a dirty and smelly person or an out-of-date styling girl? I guess some mean actions can prove their strong points after all.  *** I had someone almost killed. I was asking this neighbor of Monique about narcotics I wanted to buy. He said I can't buy anything from them if I’m not a member. One thing led to another and the next things I knew was that I was freaking out because Monique joked the guy that we were gonna join. Good thing Monique has an older bro so he bailed me out. Cool, huh? Bad thing is, the guy had to go back to his province because his "master" will go after him. Monique had to pay half of his fair. I was so hoping that Monique was kidding. Unfortunately, she wasn't. But at least this was cool.  Found out a couple of things though. Ecstasy will kill me because I’m too young. Chronic will give me migraine because I’m too young and shabu will kill me because it's too strong...and, yes, I’m too young. Bad trip...  *** I have another problem. It’s Jammi. Lately, I’ve been having doubts. Not about whether he loves me or not. I already know he does. I’m not sure but I’m willing to believe so. Anyway, I’ve been having these weird yet true thoughts lately. Thoughts about whether he and I are just friends or something more. Obviously, we aren't just friends but we aren't a couple either. I’m just confused because I don't know what he thinks. I mean, he knows I can't be in a relationship and we agreed to be friends. We even agreed that our "I love you"s are something we have to forget the moment we say it. But look at what's happening now. We’re so sweet and we do stuff. I’m really scared to ask him. Not that I’m scared to ask, I’m scared of the answer. Not that I’m assuming we are a couple but what if he thinks we're just friends and really nothing more. Or what if he assumes that I’m not in love with him anymore that's why I’m asking him.   [This is the second time I’ve blogged this out, I think]  I’ve even asked Monique to help me. Her answers kinda freaked me out a bit. She said maybe Jammi doesn't love me anymore or he's just playing with me. Or maybe he isn't so serious about us. At some point, she's so right. It scares the hell out of me. I even ran a possible scenario in my mind of what might happen. I didn't really do the guy part, more like my part only. I ended up saying stuff.  "I’m not obligating you to commit to me for the rest of our lives. We’re young and we'll meet other people. You’ll have a lot of choices and I don't wanna limit you to me. I’m just a bit scared I may never find something like this. I’m scared I may never be in a relationship where I’m loved and I like loving the person. I may never find someone so sweet and someone who appreciates me. I may never find another poetic musician in my life. I may never be happy again."  I know that sounds a lot like 20-year-old shit but isn't it better to have said what I really feel?  *** Daryl called me yesterday before I ate lunch. She sounded happy but I didn't care too much. I told her I was about to eat and I was! I was kinda happy I didn't have to talk to her actually. I didn't want to suffer in the lapses of our conversation. Besides, I have nothing to tell her. At some moments, I can't believe Daryl’s missing out on this part of my life. Not that my life is something she should enjoy. I’m just kinda sad that she's not a very big part of this. Up to now, I still wonder why she's so pissed off Jammi that every time I mention his name she turns all gloomy and shit. For all I know she has a crush on him. Honestly, I don't care anymore... I don't feel like doing so... and I’m thankful.  *** By the way, I was just wondering if anybody reads this blog. Drop a comment, if you don't mind.  *** I found out jammi sees me as a lover but we’re not a couple. Good enough...  I had the scariest dream with him. we were at school but he didn’t care. it made me so sad.

      I got this concept from an anime show named, gensomaden saiyuki. it's about four guys on a quest. in one of their episodes, they were trapped on this town with no food, no drinks, no women, no people, no food...nothing but their enemy. there was this scene where two of the guys were playing pool and one of them, gojyo, complained that the town was mind-numbingly boring because there was nothing in it. then another one of them, goku, whined about being so hungry. after that, sanzo, the guy from heaven, said that heaven was kinda like that place. the only things found there are some temples and holy people but other than that there was nothing else. that was when they all preferred hell because all the vices they're so fond of are there.   it made me think that heaven may not be that awesome. sure, it's the place of eternal happiness but when I get a temporary seemingly eternal happiness here on earth, it sucks. every day’s so happy and peaceful that it's weird and unbalanced. as they say, too much of anything is bad. besides, being okay everyday would get boring after a while. there'll be no mistakes to correct, no adventures to tackle... nothing![just goofy happiness of course]. so maybe I won't like it that much there. but then again, Jammi mentioned that when we go to heaven, another glorious body is made for us for eternal praise and happiness to god. it would be us but it won't contain our emotions. it's like us with amnesia. so maybe if I go to heaven, it'd be okay because I probably won't have my personality that won't like heaven. then, I think again, maybe, hell isn't so bad. they have every evil vice there that people enjoy. sure, people burn for eternity [which I think they will get used to] but at least they'll be havin' a bit of fun! but if everyone would want to go to hell, think of the chaos here on earth......COOL!  sometimes I wonder if religion really is something. you know, something meaning that the things in the bible did happen and the prophecies will happen. I mean, what if religion was invented by the some ancient secret group to use as some kinda brainwashing thing to control the human race's uncontrollable trouble-making... it could happen....  *** I’m still grounded but, of course, I don't give a shit. hehehe...... as a matter of fact, it seems like I’m puking, spitting and pissing on the line that my uncle set as my borderline of disobedience. of course, I did that stuff after I went a mile passed it. hehehe.... anyway, it's because I always talk to Jammi over the phone. it's fun actually. he doesn't seem like my boyfriend or someone I’m in love with. it's like [I got this line from a cd's name] "we're friends...with benefits". Benefits meaning, the occasional "I love you", the cuddly-feely moments and the [ehem, ehem] sexually satisfying activities. It’s more like we're close friends rather than a couple. But I never dared to tell this stuff to Daryl. I know she's still pissed off Jammi. So instead, I tell this stuff to Monique. I’m kind of scared to get too close to her because I already lost 3 best friends:ayen, stef and Daryl. I can face it that Daryl and I are too alike to be together. But, hey, it's too early to assume right?  I had a chat with Monique the other day. About how I think Jammi and I aren't meant for each other. I can't help comparing myself to him and his ex, Mariz. Like how rich both of them are or how much smarter Jammi is than me that I feel like an idiot when he asks me something. And how mariz's perfume is escada and mine is a cheap [but sweet, mind you] scent from scents and blends, which by the way, pushed me to lying to Jammi that I don't wear a perfume. I can't help but feel too ashamed to be "his girl". But then again, I should be happy with myself. I’m tall, pretty[yay!!!^_^] and I have potential. I just don't get it why jammi's potential's are of a 20yo's. Is it me of is he just too matured for me?  *** school's gonna start in less than a month. I can't believe the summer break has passed and I still haven't taken karate classes, I haven't stepped on dumaguete and I still don't know how to play the guitar. very nice....*rolls eyes* but, hey! I had Jammi!  I’m kinda happy about school. Daryl and I aren't classmates and I’m slowly getting it why I felt so relieved when I found out. I’ll be taking a school service during the school year so it's a new thing. I’m also gonna take karate classes. and I have my own atm card! it has nothing to do with school but it made my life a little funner [that word's from Jammi...he's my summer teacher]. oh and I have a plan on how to learn how to play the guitar! on our Christmas break, I will ask tito cocoy to give me an advanced Christmas gift which will be a guitar and I will ask mommy or I will pay the classes myself since its only p1000. Monique told me about this place where she takes her violin lesson and I think that'll work.   *** I’m a little too okay with my life right now. maybe things are calming down a little...just preparing for a war in school. cool...*sarcastic smile* I’m gonna be a front line soldier. prepare to die again, Alexandria Sese...

      oh my god....this is so rockin'!  yesterday, jammi and i talked for the whole afternoon. it was fun. mostly, we talked about narcotics. it was pretty cool actually. man, he knows a lot.   but... something so unbelievable happened afterwards...something JP and i used to do. this time, it was different. there were no words. just heavy breaths. no moans, just asking whether were ok or not every once in a while. too bad my bro arrived already. god, i never thought we'd do that...i'm kinda glad we did...heehee  this morning was cool, too. i woke up and slept again for a little while. i dreamt that i was in my grandpa's house and jammi picked me up. i rode a car which his older bro [i think] drove. we were seated at the back and i held his arms so tight it felt so real. but then, my bro was making some noise that i woke up. gosh.....

      "sometimes, the hardest thing to see is yourself." -hysterical blindness  my bro and i were watching HBO last night and this came up in a commercial. it hit me hard... very hard. it's so bold and so true. damn, it's the best line i've eard in a while. i guess, at this point, i should already engrave in my soul that i'm the protagonist and the antagonist at the same time in this "man vs. himself" plot of my life. [wow, that was weird] but, hey, at least it's not a "man vs. the world" story. hehe..... i just wanted to keep that line in mind because i think it will help me in my meaningful self-transformation.i really want to change. i want to be myself. i think i'll be more satisfied with my life if i live it the way i like. i mean, that's the reason why i hated life. besides, i can't live in the real world as a puppet. i should be able to take my own actions.  daryl and i had a talk yesterday. not really a talk but more of a phone call. gosh, there were more lapses in our conversation than there are pimples on my face. i'm starting to think that maybe what i told jammi about daryl losing her "best friend essence" is true. anyway, i just found out that she's really pissed off at jammi and i don't know why. she said if she sees him again, she'll hit him.....god.....it's like everyone's against us and slowly, they're just mad at jammi. i bet they won't believe me when i say we're only friends. hey, i'm kinda good in lying so maybe they'll believe me. i should just make up something. like how cute tito rod is so they'll see i'm really that attracted to jammi. i even told daryl yesterday that i kinda didn't wat to talk to jammi anymore. on the contrary, i wanted to talk to him so badly. god, i miss him.  tito cocoy arrived from zamboanga yesterday. he didn't mention anything about jammi or the phone call thingy. i'm kinda worried he won't allow me. man, i'm gonna rebel. hehe... he brought home so many seafood! ice boxes of shrimps [yum!] and squids [uh.....yew...]. but, hey, it's healthy anyway..

      gosh, everything's too good to be true!  my folks finally approved of jammi calling me at home but mama's still gonna talk to my uncle.   jammi and i talked over the phone yesterday for more than an hour. i had fun! we talked a lot and found something nice about each other. at the end of our conversation, i aid someting i really meant. "“I love you…..and for the first time, I really mean it. Before I didn’t when I said it. It was like, you like me, okay, I love you. But now, it’s different. I do love you, Jammi…” god, i mean it....  i just found out why my life sucks. it's because i live up to everyone's expectations i can't live up to my own. i'm too used to doing what everyone tells me that i forget what my own wants are. i realized that last year, when i found out someone hates me, i do everything i can to make them love me. now that was whacked! jammi and i had a talk about it. he said i should try using this motto:"the world fucks you, fuck the world." nice one, i'll take it then.   finally, my bro and i are talking now. just a little at a time but, hey, that's improvement...

      i'm having a great day!  first, i was able to remember to bring lunch so i'm a little closer to buying my own guitar. my parents agreed to share it with me. then, we had our computer today and i was able to see sir ralph for countless times. lastly, i was able to talk to jammi! he called and told me he had been calling for a couple of days now and he left me messages. it was so sweet of him. i had a great time. ^_^  *** i've been meeting a lot of new people lately. it's fun to meet new friends!  *** my seatmate, denise, was transferred because a couple of teachers gave mrs. dela cruz feedbacks that i was noisy. hey, is it my fault that i can listen to the teacher, write notes and chat with my seatmate at the same time?  *** i started making this comic about mimi and jammi, my two fave characters. it so cool and many of my classmates really like it! so far, i have three episodes, one crosswise each.

      it's raining so hard today. it's cold and gloomy... kinda matches my feelings.  *** yesterday, i had fun online even when jammi wasn't there. i hung out at thebeginners chatroom in mIRC and met this romanian guy who taught me so many stuff about mIRC. he wasn't the only person who had been helpful to me, but no one was as helpful as he was. he even taught me a couple of romanian phrases. his name's alexandru. it sounded really romantic.  i guess even in simple means, the world is united. i mean, people from different countries get along in chatrooms, they even help each other out. maybe it's just the political shit that's making it hard for the countries to get along. and what is with the racial discrimination? like it helps people live better lives. it only makes the world a more chaotic place to live in.

      i saw paula today. she visited again and we got into the boyfriend talking again. man, i missed jammi so much i actually ended up calling JP[oh my god!]. but, hey, it's cool. i don't care so much about him anymore. he said he got kicked out of his old school and he repeated. he's single because tin broke up with him[about time, girlalu!] and he's getting along with his classmates. i'm happy for him.   *** we had our first PALIHAN today. it was so much fun especially with sir atengco facilitating it. plus, i got to see sir ralph all day long. man, that was fun. in the morning, we played several games. it was so tiring but it was really lively with all the cheers and stuff. then after that, we had a presentation and our section presented in puppetry from. we did a midget show of what happened last time in gawad kalinga. it was fun plus i was the one who wrote the script so i'm pretty cool[heehee]. then in the afternoon, we had a major orientation of PALIHAN. then a prayer service. it was when i got to touch daryl. man, i'm starting feel numb towards her. what difference does it make? i don't care...  *** man, i miss jammi so much... "i love you, baby, always will..."

      turns out that ms. balonkita isn't so bad, considering the lecture we had this afternoon. she taught us all about the general and specific categories of personality. i found out that most of the time, i'm an extrovert. i love being with people and enjoying their company. i always stop everything i do just to be able to talk to some person who wanna talk to me. i welcome interruptions [except when i'm studying "seriously"]. but, of course, it's normal that i have an introvert side, too. when i'm in a bad mood, i usually drive people away and wanna be so alone. i also found out that i'm a feeling type of person. i'm sensitive to others' feelings [most of the time] and i always wanna please everybody in fear of hurting them. i'm sympathetic and i'm always available for advices. but i can get a bit analytical and thinking type-ish sometimes. there were times when i was already hurting someone without my knowledge.  ms. balonkita said it was normal for us to be a mixture of the different types since an individual isn't a constant matter... or something.  i also realized i really am a romantic type. i always see the better side of things and i always feel like smiling because the world, to me, is heaven.   *** i can't believe sir ralph knows i like him. curse those girls in front for being so damn loud. i can't believe i like him so much that i would fix up everytime he passed by and i would always turn to look when he's passing by... on the other building. i love those periods before lunch when he would come down from the faculty room to buy his lunch. he look especially cute today because he was wearing a shirt instead of a polo.   damn it....

      is it possible to love something you regret??  up to now, i can't believe that jammi and i are no longer a couple. we're just friends, no more lambing, no more "baby", no more [possible] future guarantees for my love life [e.g. a good boyfriend, a potetial husband, maybe even a father...MAYBE]. no more...but i'm sure in my part that i still love him but i can't as i did before. so i'll keep that to myself even if it means being unhappy forever. suddenly i realized that i ruined my onw life. the best things in my life have come and my "too good to be true" bullshit kicked in and ruined everything. man, i am beautiful but i'm utterly stupid. i mean, what was with me? i kept on telling someone i don't want to let go of to let go of me.  [dammit! i can't keep blogging this out!]  last night, i was too happy to mind that i had a really bad migraine. why? jammi and i talked! first it was through chat. he was really friendly. i told him a lot of things and he even wanted me to be a writer because he said i was incarnated to write. i was flattered because no one has really appreciated me that much for just a friend. then before i knew it, he called me up. we were still open and close but with "no strings attached". there were some parts in our conversation that mad me feel like taking him back. one was when he asked me if i missed him. the other was when i told him how much high school sucked but my bro said it was a blast. he told me the probable reason he enjoyed it was because he got laid[heehee]. he said i should get laid to enjoy high school. i got all laughy and told him i didn't have anyone to trust nough to sleep with. then he said. "me. it's not like you can't trust me anymore. wala daw. we got a little horny in the end and fortunately and unfortunately, our cordless ran out of batt. if it didn't, i wonder what would happened. [heehee]. when we said goodbye, i immediately hung up because i was so tempted to say i love you as a habit and because it was what i really felt.  is it possible to love something you regret?? yeah...  *** i'm still so sad

      I am Alexandria Krystel S. Sese, a child of Roberto G. Sese, Jr., 37 years of age, and Carissa S. Sese, 36 years of age. In chronological order, I am the second child in our family. I was born 13 years, 5 months and a couple of weeks ago next to my older brother who was born 4 years earlier. With one whole brain, one heart and enough amount of common sense, I am one over 7 billionths of this world’s population.  	In my 4885 or so days of existence, I have learned many things concerning the mathematical terms and equations of life, love, purpose and social relationships. I have narrowed down the classifications of these equations to sets.  First, an individual is included in his set of personality. That set exists within his family which is included in the community. The community that his family is included in is inside the national population and that is present in the world’s population, another set. Therefore, in simpler terms, no individual is alone or not included in a set in this world. Also, that every affiliation is a member of an even larger group.  Secondly, I have found out that in an individual, there are many parts of a whole. A person is a whole of his persona percentage. Of course, an individual is 100% human being. Into deeper terms, an individual is 50% emotional, 30% logical and 20% intuitive. One usually pays more attention to one’s feeling which leads to logical analysis of situations and then the final output depends on one’s intuition. Behaviorally speaking, one is 20% rational, 30% unreasonable, 50% logical, 10% reckless and 40% analytical. All the qualities come from birth and usually left undeveloped because of society’s demands and superstitions. Though 80% of the time, an individual’s facade is adequate to support him in his lifetime endeavors. An n individual is judged by his demeanor by 75% of the other individuals he meets. And the rest are logical enough to get to know him first.  Next, in the largest set which one would be present in, this is the world’s population; there are also many parts of a whole. About one-third’s included in poverty-stricken sets of communities, another one-third is in the moderate lifestyle set and the rest in divided into several more classes of well-off individuals.  In accordance to these philosophies, I am bound to tell that I myself am a part of a whole in a percentage, a part of the fractional equation of the world’s population and am a contribution to the sets existing at the moment. Although, I see myself as one in a million. My persona is quite altered. I am distorted by what is reflected to my eyes, to what I believe and what I believe is my purpose of existence. I am the product of the world’s display of culture which is divided into many regions. Those divisions are reciprocated and the quotient is my points of view. I am the product of many individuals multiplied by the times of repetitions of their appearances in my life which is the result of my beliefs and principles. I am the product of countless experiences added to the knowledge provided by books. The 3 products mentioned are the addends of my life equation which consequences to my answer. I am what I make of myself; I am not altered by society’s demands or its superstitions. I am the quotient of eternity divided by the limitation of mortality. I am… me.   man, this math assignment is gonna rock!

      i've been such a mess lately that i haven't noticed some of the better things in life...  my brother seems to be having a really good time in college. his classmate, sandra the hottie, is totally into him. i'm glad they're having a good time. m gian told me all about her during dinner the other night. man, was he excited. not only that, but sandra's friend, joan, is also checking him out though she isn't single anymore. my bro really is very charismatic...  joana called last night. she also is very happy about her new school. she seems to be having a blast in lourdes with all the co-ed stuff and how she excels there. i'm really happy for her, i'm glad she feels good there and people aren't terrorizing her. plus, she's becoming a heartrub there but she told me she really wants to wait til she's in college before she gets into a relationship. well, i think she's a really good person. she may be living a perfect lifestyle [which i usually would hate] but i really admire her optimistic personality. she's so upbeat and cheerful. she was even sweet enough to tell me she'd call me every week for news. wow, she's so friendly, too!  i bought a couple of cd's yesterday with my uncle and his friend, tito[uncle] rod whom i used to find really cute. nothing much about that, i just had a pretty relaxing afternoon.  *** jammi's probably moving on already..so maybe i have to, too...

      i'm still in so much shock, i can't believe thati have just "broken off" with jammi. truns out he didn't receive the email so i just told him through chat. it wasn't as hard as i expected it to be but it was too painful. especially when i was done telling him my piece, it was like he wasn't taking me seriously. he wanted to change the topic. i couldn't log out because i really wanted to know his response. but then, several minutes already passed but there was still nothing. so i ended up asking him if it was okay with him. he said it wasn't but since it what i wanted, he'd pretend he was. it was really embarassing when i told him i was kinda hoping he'd stop me because he replied i shouldn't have told him in the first place. i made the wrong choice of words. i should've said i expected, not hoped. and besides, i couldn't keep on letting him love me when i'm not sure anymore if i loved him. i wonder if he was just shocked last night or if he was just nonchalant of the matter. whatever...it's through. i blew off the only desperate wish i ever made. i'm really so pathetic. but, hey, i'm human, i make mistakes and i have no other choice but to face it.  then paula was so sweet to try to help. i guess it got to everybody that i broke up with jammi. she said he wasn't being very nice today. hey, it's normal, i hurt him so he's hurt or angry. man, this is affecting many people...  *** daryl's being a bitch lately. she told everybody else that she was kinda feeling sad because i kept on hanging out with monique and that she and i seldom get together. what's her problem? when i see her i greet her and smile hoping she'd wanna join me but no! she just smiles...more like smirks and says a stupid hi. monique and i heard that news a few minutes before we saw daryl with carmina in the canteen. i said hi in the liveliest i could and she was such a snob! then she turned to monique and was seeking for her attention. i was really impressed when she kinda stood up for me. she pulled an annoyed face and told daryl to hang out with me with the hidden message of "bug off". then, monique and i came to the conclusion that daryl was being a hypocrite. we mean, why would she say those things to other people and be so nice to monique. i'm so tired of dealing with her childishness and i'm tired of being the one whose always making peace with her. there were times when she was unfair to me. i was the one who always apologizes even when it was her fault. i do love her but it's not fair to me. i know that she cared for me a lot but it was like she never matured...even just a bit. i did, in my defense. she kinda helped me with my tolerance of other people. sometimes, she would do things that would really make me feel angry or disappointed but i would just let it go. i was too tired to confront her and then be the one who apologizes afterwards.   well, screw her...  *** i haven't been inspired in quite a long time. i was a mess so an outpour of words came out..  isang huling tingin sa isa't isa mga puso ay tila balisa nakaraan na ang mga salita mga luha'y di na nakita wala nang muli pang iasa  isang huling tingin sa mga alaala naisip na mali ang lahat ng inakala katahimikan na lamang ang nananatili isang huling tingin ang huling sandali bago ang lahat ay tuluyan nang mawala  paalam na, aking sinta mahirap man tanggapin ang katotohanan  nabitawan na ang mga salita  ngunit sana limutin ang nakaraan paalam na... --- fly, my butterfly, fly flutter your wings and soar high don't let a day pass by without ever reaching the sky  carry my hopes and dreams to a place where laughters are streams where life's as sweet as lemon creams and the lovely sky never dims.  fly, my butterfly, fly spread your wings and fly no one shall bring you down no one shall hurt our hopes must never fly fly... my butterfly --- ambivalence... of doubt and love...  doubt... of absence or comfort...  love... of you...  confusion... between pain and relief...  pain... of affection, of change...  relief... of bliss...  a decision... between life and death...  a life of light... with doubt and love...  and death... of confusion and frustration...  darkness... alone...  i choose... --- in the silence of my heart in the ceasing of my soul i am a girl broken apart by love and faith's important role  letting go and falling back with lullabies of shedding tears now i know what i lack enough smiles to face my fears  a wish was granted but then i hurt too soon it was to settle down now i'm down under the dirt without any but a frown  the past is done, what more can i do? things were said, tears were said now the light has gone and so have you nothing more, just wished i was dead... --- to GOD  Yu're the sun of my days each is bright with Your face You're the moon of every evening giving life it's very meaning  You're the rainbow after the rain which washed away my grief and my pain You're the water to quench my thirst You're the love i had at first  You're the color of my sky the wind here low and high You're the smile across my face You're the grace that love relays  You're the spirit that lives in me like the leaves of every tree You're all that have and i ever will i cherish You now and always will...

      "to err is human, to fogive is divine" mrs. dela cruz said that earlier. it made so much sense.   then,in our THE class, we watched this film about developing self-esteem. there was this model who told the viewers the same problem i had. she said she was living a life when all of her peers are decicing for her. then she realized it shouldn't be like that. it's her life and she should be the one in control. i'm glad i'm not alone.  *** i'm in such a bad mood today that i wore my hair down as a sign of..well, my bad day. it actually looked good so it made me feel a bit better. anyway, the jammi thing has been eating me alive. i had to tell someone, so i told kuya mico. he said it wa complicated shit and so do i. it's so frustrating.  i really need to break up with him...  *** remember lyle and yang? i joined the theresian chat room in mIRC and i catched her there. turns out she wasn't mad at me and that the issue became some kinda rumor. waaahhh!!!  *** i passed the first round of badminton try-outs.

      i had a nice day...  i figured my day would really be nice if i said so... heehee...  i've just realized that thewhole day, i didn't talk about jammi. i figured i would just get all upset and teary if i talked about him. but it doesn't really mean i didn't think about him because i did, a lot, actually. i just really miss him so much.   i'm gonna be taking a big step tomorrow and on wednesday. tomorrow, monique and i are going to try out for the badminton team. i'm really excited but kinda anxious, too. then on wednesday, i'll be tryin out for the basketball team but monique isn't sure if she's gonna be coming with me. i guess she's still traumatized because she gave up the last time. but. hey, she tried, that's why it was called a try-out, duh...  i'm proud to be a filipino. earlier we ate at mcdonald's and the valets were so sweet polite. when we were going to the car, they shared their umbrella with us and one of them even greeted me. then when i entered the car and thanked him, he even said, "ingat kayo, ma'am.[take care, ma'am]". i couldn't help but smile at such a simple gesture. i guess no matter how bad our economy is becoming, there are still a lot of small things that make our country really nice...  *** paula is so lucky to be kuya mico's girlfriend. i could feel that he truly loves her very much. it all happened last night... i was trying to download the mIRC but i didn't know how to install it nor how to use it. fortunately, kuya mico went online so i asked for his help. it took us almost an hour to finally get it right. turns out it was my fault because i was in too much hurry that i kept overlooking the folder we were looking for. man, how stupid am i? anyway, he was really patient and really nice. then before i went, i asked him to say hi to jammi for me and tell him i miss him so much. then he asked me if i really loved jammi so i said yes, of course i do. then he asked if i was sure, i said yes, i am. then he asked me if i loved jammi just as much as he loved paula so i asked how he loved paula. he told me he loved paula so much that he couldn't help watching over her all the time. gosh, it sent me into another kilig state. then i said i do. then i assured him that i would always take care f his friend. then he said he wasn't worried about that, it was something else. i got all worried but he told me to relax when i sleep and that was really nice of him.   paula came to school earlier. she won't be starting her school until next monday. when she came, i was so impressed because she was wearing make-up and it looked good on her. then we got into the talking about her boyfriend and my boy friend. i guess the two guys have a lot in common. and she told me that jammi told her that his fave song is so slow so he's going to court me slowly. wow, how sweet. i just wish... he was here...  *** i'm changing..gradually, i could keep my smile for a whole day and i haven't been a bad mood. yay!

      it hurts to realize that in exchange for the supposedly best days of my life, i have to give up something, some moments. gone are the times when i could write poems in class, gone are the days when i could miss doing my homeworks, gone are the days when i hang out with daryl, gone are the days when i could be as naive and ignorant as i want, gone are the days i have with jammi. this is so hard. i feel so sad and helpless. it's like i'm having some kind of culture shock. i don't think i'm ready to take in the high school culture, it's all too complicated, too hurried, too much. i'm not saying i hate it but i'm weak, i get scared easily. i'm scared of the changes happening. i don't want to let go of the things i enjoy. i know some greater things will soon replace them but nothing beats the original, right?  just yesterday, i was talking to kuya mico through chat and we got into the talking. i started telling him how much my life sucks.. well, just a part. he said it was really like that at first but soon it would get better. i'm glad i'm not alone, i'm not the only person who thinks the line, "high school days are the best days of your lives" is bullshit. hey, i know i'm not the only one ith this problem but this is me. i pay more attention to myself than i do to others. i also told him i'm missing a lot of people. actually, i realized what i really felt about my parents. i do miss them but i'm also angry at them. they missed the most important events in my life and they should face the reality that they can never take those back. my elementary graduation will never happen again. i would never be confirmed again. they will never be able to attend a parent-daughter bonding session ever again. of course, they won't be able to attend my high school graduation either. but i really can't blame them. it's inevitable, they're working for "better opportunities"... better opportunities my ass. why can't things stay as they were? that was such a stupid question. but still, can't we just change physically? why do things happen when you don't want them to?  i feel so strongly about these things. it's been a long time since i cried because of the things i think of. i usually cry when i'm so tired or so frustrated of the things happening, not the thing i think of. when i was talking to kuya mico, i was so teary that i couldn't see the keyboard anymore. i was sad, so alone, so hurt. but at one point, i felt so pathetic. i mean, i shouldn't be crying, other people have worse lives than mine and i have people who care for me. and i know very well that the last thing i want to do is pity myself. it will only make me a lot more pathetic than i already am. it won't help and i'll only feel more helpless. but, i'm a girl and [not being a sexist or anything] girls are touchy-feely and all emotional. i don't care, crying de-stresses me.  *** it's so hard with jammi. i haven't been able to talk to him for a week now... i mean, an hour conversation. i did call him a couple of days ago but his mom was home so he had to go. then, we chatted a bit last night but he was grounded. god, i miss him so much that i get all teary when i think of him. it's like i'm falling even deeper but i want to fall out it. i can't deal with everyday life worrying like hell for a person whom i can't even talk to. but i want to be strong. i've pressed the restart button of my life and i command my soul to get a grip and be strong. i don't want to be like who i was... helpless coward me. i don't want to bail out on something just because it's hard. i chose this so i should face it. it's just that i don't think this is working out. maybe it's true i'm too young for this. we're both a bit too busy for each other. kuya mico told me that jammi has priorities and studies is one of them. i don't want to bother him in that. and besides, jammi is a guy so of course he would want girls. i don't want to limit him to a girl he can't even see. honestly, he's just wasting his time.   maybe i should break up with him. not really break up since we were never a couple in the first place. maybe we should just be friends...seriously. i would never want to hurt him but pursuing this kind of connection will be more painful. but that will be making me a bitch to his friends...even to him. but hey, he said it himself, if they don't like you screw them. besides, i would be doing it for a good reason... for both our sakes.  *** i'm too afected by jammi that when monique called last night, i could get enough happiness to talk to her in a happy voice. i couldn't even fake it. when she asked what was my problem, i couldn't help get all teary again whe i told her about jammi and how much i miss him.  *** i'm a mess...

      hijune 10...  i never thought HS teachers are going to be frank with reality already. in english, we discussed about larry alcala's slice of life entitled "housemaid shortage". i didn't expect ms. de la cruz to be frank about the euphemism of "talent agencies" and that, in fact, they're prostitution dens. not that i found it offending, i was actually glad about it. at least teachers in this departmentare more mature and in touch with reality than those fairy-taley teachers back in elementary.  in our filipino class, ms. gino cruz introduced to us the SEG[student enrichment group], dulaang pinoy. it's theatre arts in filipino. members will be participating in school plays. they attend acting, make-up, costume, prop-making and voice modulation workshops. they also watch plays. it sounded like a lot of fun and i think i can do it. i'm capable of confidence for the hundreds, i can act as long as there are people supporting me and what's the harm in trying, right? i really want to try out different things this time. i'm so tired of writing and jammi said it's fun to act so i may as well try it.   ate aleris, monique's senior friend, was really cool. she's was so friendly and matured. she told ius all about the wacky and nice teachers in high school, their qualities and their effect on students. then we found out from a junior the one rule in the high school department: RESPECT YOUR ELDERS. meaning, give way to them in the corridors, act ever so humbly in their presence, don't be all too happy around them, etc. cool, huh?  i'm not becoming tomboyish or bisexual or anything, i'm just crushing on some really pretty seniors. one of them is diwa, "my angel". she's so cute with her glasses and she looks so sporty. the other one is vikki, "my princess". she was the one who introduced me to herself and her friends for no reason back when i was in third grade. the last one is gail, "engkantada ko"[my fairy]. my bro used to have a crush on her and i must admit that she is beautiful. aaahhhh.....the last of the theresian hotties. when they graduate, st. theresa's college will be no more than a school of geeks....eheheheh...  *** today....  sir ralph rocks! i have a HUGE crush on him. he's so funny and so cool and so cute....dreamy..it's his birthday today actually.   the butterfly effect=a neurological idea that one flap of the butterfly's wings is enough to cause a tornado. it's just a concept presenting the idea of large consequences for tiny actions. and even if it's small, when itirated, it is amplified. why such a topic from sir ralph? he related it to cheating. he said that 3 seconds of cheating could cause you your cleam record, your self immaturity and probably your reputation. it was so cool how he explained it. gish, he's so bright.  monique went to the basketball try-outs today. i was supposd to watch her but i got caught up talking to alison. alison and i seldom talk but when we do, we can relate. i thought she was the kind of person who is so damn perfect but she's not. she's the same as me, bright students striving for individuality and freedom. we talk like this every once in a while but we still keep some kind of professional distance from each other. anyway, when i came back to monique, i found out she gave up already. she said she was too tired to continue and she looked like she was about to pass out. i felt really guilty because i should've been there to annoy her and make her continue. i think there will be another try-out next week because there were only very few people who tried-out and they need 12 players for the team. i really wanted to join all of a sudden.  i have som SEG in mind already: -dulaang pinoy -CAST [theatre atrs in english] -badminton club [it's seasonal so it may not come] -basketball team -midnight society [discovering the mysteries of life..man...purpose, maybe. the club for the curious...?]

      i had a pretty nice day today...  i'm glad i'm making new aqcuaintances while keeping close touch to old ones. i don't feel, somewhat, too committed to daryl anymore. it's kinda good actually considering the fact that i was started to feel strangled by her constant presence. we still hang out but not that much anymore. we hug as a greeting but we don't comply to past "sweet habits". weird [yet expected] thing though, i don't miss it at all. maybe it was time we loosened our firm grip of each other. we are moving on already. monique has been great! we hang out, talk, and i enjoy her company. we're open, meaning our embrace of one another isn't closed and there will always be room for many. but, i'm kinda afrain to call her a best friend so i keep it safe by keeping a couple of close, intimate companions. i feel that carla, alison and martha are kinda pissed off at me. maybe it's because i'm with monique. hey, we're just hanging out, doesn't mean i'm owning her. my current circle includes ayen and stef. i'm really glad we're able to be togethere again. i can't really realize that i missed them but i feel that i did.  i'm pretty cool with my new classmates. i think our class is made up of comediennes, intellectuals and fun girls so i think we're pretty extraordinary. i met our computer teacher today, sir ralph. he rocks! very energetic and fun. sir ralph's was kinda like mark logan's and he would do really well on a toothpaste commercial because of his irresistable smile. man, we had a good laugh in his period. he even said one thing that was so catchy. "rationality is what separates us from animals..." very nice.... ms. Bolangkita is the terror of THE. She notices every single detail and over-elaborates her point. Our speech class is my fave. It builds self-confidence, improves grammar and vocabulary, makes you a fluent and modulated speaker, etc. ms, dela cruz even commented on my piece in our graded recitation and when we explained to our classmates our hand language paper. She said I had nice choice of words. I agree with that because I did use deep shit in that. Good thing was, I didn’t nervous when I recited. I was confident. I didn’t fidget or shake. I was cool…  I miss jammi so much. I wish he had a nice day in school [damn, I sound like a mom]. Actually, I don’t care if mariz got back with him or he forgot me, just as long as he’s alive, I’m ok.  “I love you, baby…”

      the first day of the schoolyear is almost over. finally, the anxiety and nervousness has passed. now i am officially a freshie.   the day started with me and my headache. i've had very little sleep last night because of the nerve-wrecking thoughts of high school. then, the next thing i know, it was already the welcoming rites. i can't believe i was the first one to walk on the aisle in the middle of 200 or so ladies screaming like crazy. it was kinda embarassing and thrilling at the same time. i fell really sleepy when the personnel intros began. i was awakened every minute by the juniors cheering for the teachers. man, were they happy. recess followed and i hung out with monique and ayen [daryl was absent]. when we came back, we had some unfreezing activities. i liked the second one the best because i felt confident to speak. i also liked the third. it made me realize the root of my failure: fear. fear of challenges, pressure, change..attention...? i found some of my classmates quite interesting. one of them was april, she said she was unique/her own individual but nonchalant at the same time. i found her self-description catchy. then, zari, a transferree who loves ballet and was very loud. lastly, jasmine who was unusually shy. it was like she was forcing her bangs to cover her eyes... almost her face. then we were given our sched. i spent lunch with monique and ayen. the cafeteria was jam-packed and there was no where to stay in anywhere. at one point, i felt extremely unwelcome and uncomfy in the HS department. when i used the CR that lunch, the sophomores dominating it at that time stared at me and i felt so intimidated. there was some kind of disgust and rejection in their look. creepy... after lunch, we met two of our teachers. first was mr. dela cruz. he was cute but towards the end of the meeting, i found him quite faggy... i think gay is more polite. i'm not sure if it was the way he said some things or the way he moved his arms. i dunno... our filipino didn't show up so we met our AP teacher next, ms. san andres. she's really energetic and she talked a lot [in a good way]. we weren't able to introduce ourselves because she was talking, which we liked because we were so tired of introducing ourselves. all day i was expecting jammi to come even when i told him not to.   *** things i learned today: 1. you shouldn't be ashamed of growing up.  2. if people don't like you, screw them [in the words of lyle and jammi] 3. everyday is a new opportunity to change. 4. smile...^_^

      my soul tells me i am dreaming and so my body agrees i feel that this is bliss in closed eyes and if consciousness will keep me from this moment then in eternal sleep i shall stay if to slumber forever is to pass on then to death i shall surrender...  those lips and eyes possessed by an angel with the touch of feather and the breath of breeze with the warmth of spring  the thrill of summer I fall for you my soul is pulled out of me to you as if it was all meant to be under the gloomy skies and chilling wind I long for you…  A kiss will end this anxiety And start a new moment A kiss will suffice for this day’s desire One contact will let me die And fall to the deepest It shall drive to chaos with peace The kiss will be the first..

      i am now convinced that human's can be sick by nature. i've been watching MGB for quite a while now and i've come to the conclusion that more and more murders are being committed. there was this one time where this pretty lady was raped and killed by this drunk guys in her condo. then there was this guy who was burned by the guy who had a big debt to him. it was just sick... sometimes, it's freaky to think that i'm capable to do that. when i told my bro that it was really scary why these happen, he said it was better here because people kill with a reason but in the US, people kill for nothing... like they kill for fun... now,  that  is sick.   [please don't curse me, may you guys rest in peace...]  what if some of the victims were deserving of their death? could it be possible that the press always brand the victims as the innocent ones and the killers as the guilty? just trying to be unbiased...  *** i can't believe i'd be going back to school in two days. i'm kinda scared... of the "newness". but i do have something to look forward to on the first day. jammi told he'd come since their first day is on wednesday. i told him not to come but i really hope he would. ^_^  *** i'm gonna miss jammi. we won't be able to talk too much this schoolyear... =(

      i couldn't help thinking about my chat last night with jammi. i was gonna update my blog when i noticed that he was online so i talked to him. i don't know what came over me that suddenly i was all serious and stuff. i asked him, "hypothetically speaking, what if i became your ex or something, how would you break up with me?". he said it depended on the reason we broke up. i told him what if we just fell out of love. he said he'll tell me, "alex, i don't think is working out anymore. i've fallen out of it." next thing i knew, i was feeling teary and heavy. it hurt and it wasn't true [yet..i hope not] what more if it was? then, a few minutes later, i realized why i asked him. i remember monique freaking me out when she said i should prepare myself for a break up so i won't be sulking around when it does happen. then, suddenly, i gathered enough courage to say what i've been itching to tell him. i told him he was my inspiration. then an "i love you" and i logged out because our computer was flipping out. i was kinda annoyed when he made lambing to me. i was serious, i'm not sure if he was.  sometimes, i wish we didn't fall in love. maybe it was better if i was the only one who fell. i just realized that all relationships that end up in romance are as cliche as the golden rule. wasn't it more thrilling and exciting when we were itching to say what we felt and how each other's presence was an added suspense? wasn't it funner when i was so excited to be being in the next level than actually being on it? it's not that i don't like where we are now because i do, i just can't help falling madly in love. i always thought being so head over heels in love is much more fulfilling. i can't help holding back. all because of my bad experiences i can't indulge my self in his 'i love you's, i find it so hard to trust him so much as i trusted JP, i can't fall any deeper....   i don't know what's happening to me. probably because i deprived myself of my own freedom that i don't see the point of enjoying. maybe it's because i'm jealous because my friends have boyfriends and i know almost exactly what'll happen[face it, men will be men]. this is even worse than my insecurity. i can't say i've fallen out of love because i haven't. i don't know if it's out of love or pity. i just can't hurt jammi, it would hurt me even more.   suddenly, i start thinking about the future, what if i was to go abroad? what will we do when the schoolyear starts? i can't believe sometimes, i find myself thinking of marrying him and having children with him. i had this picture in my mind with him and our kid. it was nice but sometime soon, i have to delete that from my memory.  but looking at the bright side, here are 3 reasons why i say he's my inspiration: 1. the thought of him provokes the outpour of words which are my "works" 2. he makes my day brighter and he has the ability to put me into a bad mood 3. whenever i talk to him, i believe that there's still one person who isn't everybody else's marionette and he makes me strive to be different. i have others in mind but they won't come out.  *** man, i've got issues...serious ones...

      is it just me or jammi? i don't get it why i just can't miss him the way i missed JP. it's like, jammi and i are just friends, like me and daryl not talking for a while. dammit!   i really feel glad about monique though. i'm glad i'm helping her [i think] with her boyfriend secrecy problem. i could relate [big time]. i guess this advice thing isn't such a bad idea.   *** i met this guy through the rock chatroom earlier. he's nicolo, 20, from cebu. kind of rockerish and he smokes weed[cool!]. he was nice and he said i was funny! hehe....  *** i miss lyle. not in a loving way, more like "aww...crap lost another bud" way...^_^

      the other day, something so weird and klutzy of me happened. can you believe that i actually smashed the light bulb in our room? it happened when i was testing my badminton racket and i accidentally hit the bulb. it was smashed into pieces and the shattered bulb showered upon me and i started to panic. it was a coincidence that jammi called the very same minute. i told him about it and he kept on laughing. though i didn't tell anybody the real reason i broke it, i told them i was yanking my THE project out of my bag and it flew to the ceiling and hit the bulb. wow, i didn't think anybody would buy that but hey, no one else saw the incident so it's the only thing they could believe.   that was the weirdest accident that ever happened to me! i can't help smiling at the fact that, one day, i may be telling my kids, "hey, sweetie, you know, mama broke the light bulb once.." that would be the lamest thing they'd probably hear from me...  so anyway, jammi called that night. he was really sweet and stuff [as always]. later that night, we went on a three-way connection with my friend, carmina, who asked me if jammi could help her in putting chords in the song she wrote. we didn't really finish anything but they were able to know each other. i was really kilig when carmina told me that we were perfect for each other even by just judging with the voices. the next day [yesterday] she told me that jammi and she talked through SMS the night before. she asked him if we were close and jammi said we were so close! being a really perky girl, carmina asked how come he didn't court me and he replied with a, "hindi eh, friends lang kami [no, we're just friends]." it doesn't matter since i feel inside that i love him and somehow, he loves me, too. even if i'm wrong about the "he loves me, too", it wouldn't matter since we're not really attached or anything.  Yesterday was our second PALIHAN. Our theme was about Filipino Youth. The day didn’t start so great since our PALIHAN notebooks were missing so we have to replace them. Anyway, before recess, we viewed this documentary film about children in labor. It was entitled, “Minsan Lang Sila Bata.” It was the most horrifying thing that touched me.  The first part of it was in taken in a slaughterhouse in Cebu. There was this kid, 13 years in age though he looked so much smaller than what a regular 13-year-old kid would look like. His work in the slaughterhouse was to shave off the remaining hair on the pigs which the machine didn’t get. The usual mishaps that happen to them is slip, get really dirty or cut themselves. There was this part where he cut himself and he didn’t even care that much when in reality, his wound could get really infected. Then there was Dio, 14 years old, working for the slaughterhouse. He was so dirty that flies were sticking to him. Sometimes, their bosses don’t give them their salaries and sometimes, they’re only given the little fats from the pigs or cows they clean. Then when they come home, they’d sell those fats in the public market and they have to be careful because selling isn’t allowed for them. But do they really have a choice when they’d starve if they don’t make money?  The next one was in Ormoc, a little girl named Telena, 10 years old, working in a field cutting off some kind of grass with her 3 brothers. It was really sad how she wanted to go to school but couldn’t. she and the other children there are worrying about the debt their parents made at such a young age. It awakens some kind of disgust inside me. I feel disgust of the government and how they play blind to this situation. I know that they have to cut off a lot from the country’s budget to solve this but these small things are the reasons why our country’s down in the dumps. I feel disgust for the parents who “raise” these kids. They’re so irresponsible to let their own children slave for the mistakes they did. I feel disgust for myself. While I hate going to school, these kids are dying to go to school even for just a day.   The last one was really intense. It was in this dock in Dapitan where 5 kids were to transfer 12,000 sacks of cement for two days. It was unfair how the adults treat them. They were the ones who were doing the harder work for the adults instead of the adults doing it for them. It was just too much.   It makes me think of how lucky I really am. I was born in a situation where I don’t have to work like those kids. I’m able to attend a school, a private one even. I can eat more than three meals a day. I don’t have to get dirty or hurt. These kids work even harder than my folks. They get so wounded inside and out and they won’t even complain about it. For them, it’s life….always will be. I get a little cut and I complain already. They almost get their fingers cut off and they just laugh about it. Makes me think how unfair the world is. Why is it that these kids, so young and so innocent, have to endure these pains?  I swear that I will do something about it…one way or another.&nbsp;  &nbsp;I do learn from these school gimmicks…I was so moved that I was actually inspired by reality…  Mg salik ang nakita ko kanina Mga mamamayang mura pa’t mahina Laking gulat ko bilang Theresiana Kabataan pala’y naghahanapbuhay na  Kasing edad ko ngunit layo sa edukasyon Sapagkat sa utang at hirap ay baon Gusto nilang makapag-aral pero bakit ganoon? Parang walang pag-asa kahit sa darating na panahon  Trese, katorse pero katawa’y maliit pa Sa trabaho ba naming sila’y magkandarapa Sa paligid nilang mas marumi pa sa lupa Mas mahina pa sa bagong silang na tupa  Pati problema ng magulang ay problema nila Parang pinarurusahan sa di nila sala Nais lamang nila’y awa at pagpapala Ginahawa ng buhay kasama ang madla  Kaya’t tayong mapapalad ay magsimulang kumilos  Mag-aral ng mabuti upang pagdatin ng panahon Mga bayaning ito’y ating maiahon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       july 17   this day tunred out so much better than i thought. the leadership training rocked! it wasn't like the leadership trainings in elem, it was realistic, it was useful and, for once, it was actually eye-opening.  &nbsp;  at the start of the day, everybody was, of course, still not vibing it too much since we didn't know each other well yet. there were some people i knew, nicole, amabel and chunky, the badminton varsity cap. i found out that amabel and she are godsiblings. anyway, chunky was really friendly and i really find her cute. our first activity was some kind of amazing race. it was fun! especially in the part where we had to find 4 girls with the same month of birthday. unfortunately, there were only two of us born on january, minnie and i. minnie is the sophomore i see hanging out with the other popular people. she has light complexion, tomboyish air and chinky eyes plus the cutest nose i've seen! she's really nice, a contrary of what i assumed she was. anyway, we had to sing "nopyi" by bamboo to pass the task. then later, we were asked to do a symbolism of ourselves. we had to draw a shape of a man [like a gingerbread man] and paste 5 symbols of ourselves which we cut out from the newspaper we brought. the activity had a big impact on me. i was confident in sharing about myself and i felt no shame [naks!]. we were grouped into 7. my groupmates were regina, ate marion, ate ira and ate feliz. ate feliz is this sophomore whom i really like. when she was sharing to us her symbol, i found her mature and deep. then, ate marion is the junior who had this smart air around her. ate ira, the senior in our group, was a proof that theresians have poise. she talked with confidence. and regina is batchmate of mine who is the shy quiet type but is the type of person appropriate to be a leader. the activity was one of the things i liked today. it was an eye-opener in a sense that it increased our self-awareness. i think self-awareness is important for a leader to have. because in order to be a good leader, we must know how to deal with people. to deal with people well, we must know them. but how can we know them when we don't even know ourselves? the next activity was a value voting activity. we were asked a couple of questions and we had to choose which answer we wanted. there was a time when we were asked if we had cheated on any exam. my conscience was killing me but i just said to myself, "i cheated on a quiz, not an exam". at that time, i really wanted to befriend this senior named, jax. she used to be in basketball varsity. that activity determined our decision-making. i also liked it. in the afternoon, we watched a film called "dave". it was about this man named dave who was hired by the government to play as a decoy for the president who had a serious stroke. the chief of staff wanted to hide the truth from the people so he hired dave. things got out of hand for the cheif of staff because dave started to do things which a president should do which the villain doesn't want him to do. it showed real leadership.  &nbsp;  leaders should be responsible and resourceful. they must have a good sense of priority so they can make way for the more important things. leaders must know whom they are working for and must display a good image for everyone to imitate. leaders must pay attention to everything even the little things. because all things, great or small, are significant to all.  &nbsp;  what is a leader?  i have the whole year to find out!   *** &nbsp;  I wasn’t in the greatest mood today. It must have been because I just came back from a fever. It must’ve been because I miss jammi. I dunno, I just didn’t feel too energetic. Plus, I get the strongest feeling that my “friends” are hating me right now. Faith, lara and the others are starting to come snobbish to me. Maybe that’s also one of the reasons I don’t feel so happy. That’s why I’ve decided to keep quiet.  &nbsp;  Today we also changed seats. All of us who always cheat on tests were arranged apart. I guess teachers have that intuition about their students or something. Anyway, it’s cool since I can concentrate better on my studies now and I would be taken from my tempting classmates showing me their answers. It’s cool, at least I can think well from shutting up.   *** &nbsp;  Daryl and I spent lunch together. It was really nice to be able to hang out with her again. She even hugged me a couple of times. I missed those times when we were really close like sisters. Hey, we could always come back to that time…except it wouldn’t be going back, it would be moving on. In a sense that we put the past where it should be and face what’s ahead of us. Of course, it would take time, like everything else.  &nbsp;  Ate alariz has been really nice to me. We hang out every dismissal and I find her really cool, for a senior, she’s really funky. ^_^  &nbsp;  I guess this day is cool….&nbsp; &nbsp;  ***  Check this out….  &nbsp;  What is love?  An irrational feeling  Driving you to the depths of extremity  Pulling the spirit, heart and mind apart  Love is limit-breaking  &nbsp;  It is confusion  Blurring logic  Destructing systems  Breaking routines  Crushing foci  Love is chaos  &nbsp;  It is pain, tears, heartbreak  Love is sacrifice  &nbsp;  It is blindness  Blocking the flaws and imperfections  Displaying mirages of smiles and sunsets  Love is the illusion of perfection  &nbsp;  It is a dream  A basis of paradise  The momentary ecstasy  Love is hope  &nbsp;  It is a feeling  An emotion  A temporary condition  Love is a constant change  &nbsp;  It is an essence of being  A reason for existence  Belief of purpose  Love is life  &nbsp;  What is love?

      i had a pretty nice day...  jammi called last night. and needless to say we were okay. like nothing happened. it was nice though i really miss him still. hey, these things rake time don't they?  i attended my very fist badminton practice this afternoon. i met this student named stephanie and she was so nice! i sucked pretty badly in serving so she taught me how to. and so did karla. i can't feel my arms though. but hey it was fun...

      now i won't have any problems with jammi because i don't have to talk to him anymore. i was so pissed of i blew him off when he went online. why should i be so patient to tolerate his... presence? he didn't even say he's sorry, so why should i forgive him? doesn't that give me the right to be angry? our guidance counselor told to be angry isn't wrong because it's an emotion. i don't care if jammi kills himself. what does it matter? it's not like he's my boyfriend. i don't care, i can always find someone else. he may not be my "knight in shining armor with a guitar instead of a buckler", but, he would still be a guy. so what if jammi's sad? it's not my problem anymore.  though, i am being a bitch this way. i have no right to be angry because of some kind of rejection. i did reject him first so it's only fair. i was the one who caused all of these to begin with. maybe, it's bad karma...it is! i'm being punished for being so cruel, so stubborn so irrational. hell with it! i don't give a shit.  *** i met this guy throught mIRC today. he's really sweet and he likes me. i couldn't keep on noticing how nice he was but i know how fake it was. just as how fake i am to my own self...  *** god, i'm a fucking mess. i don't know what else to do with my life but mess it more. hey, it's the standard theory of life. when things become so messed up and its damage is irreversalbe, it comes back to its glorious form! if i keep messing this up, i don't think it's gonna come back to its glorious form, it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse....

      finally, my urge to tell jammi i love him is gone. how? stupid me, i told him. i was too sucked up at the moment that i asked him if he still is gonna smoke. to my heart's breaking he said yes. i figured i'm gonna lose like a second with him with every stick he smoked. so i told i loved him. it wasn't pretty at all. he was all shocked. i asked him to pretend it never happened but he won't, it doesn't matter. i would.

      it was prechi's birthday the other day and today we went to celebrate it in McDonald's. i had such a blast! we first walked all the way to Heights[a studio] and it took us almost an hour before we could have our pictures taken. why? there were like 23 of us in the small place and bad thing was there were some students from other schools and we were there in so much chatter. it's okay, we had fun. then when we arrived in McDo, the lines to the counter were soooo loooong! we were there for like almost half an hour. there were also some lourdesians but it's cool. when we ate, i found out a lot! i ate with prechi, sarie, chrizelle and lara in one table. man, lara and sarie are so funny and warm. so was chrizelle and prechi. i thought sarie was snobbish because she looked like she was. turns out sh'e as goofy as lara. after an hour or so, my friends went wild. they were so high from eating and laughing that they became so happy! then, one by one, people left and only the five of us were left. i ate like 3 large fries but i don't know wy i don't feel full at all. i had so much fun!  *** this morning, i decided to hang out with chrizelle and prechi in front of the school pond near gate 1 since i arrived in school early. it was really relaxing there! i found good and comfortable compnay with my classmates. i'm so glad i'm in the class of section 6! people here are so energetic and happy. there wasn't a day when i was shy to be wacky or weird. there wasn't a day when i was gloomy as hell. i'm gonna have so much fun this year!  *** our class is generous in a way that we cheat a lot. it's no biggie since our class secretary, whose really honored, cheats. we don't do it all the time, just often. and we share food in the middle of Filipino class because mrs. catindoy doesn't see us anyway. we keep on talking and laughing in the middle of class and even outside. teachers have named us as the class of unbelievably hyper pupils. at least, we ain't sluggish!^_^  *** i dunno if i should talk to jammi. i'm kinda still pissed off at him even when i told him wasn't anymore.

      i found it so hard to concentrate in school the other day. i couldn't help thinking of jammi. i couldn't help imagining him seated on the empty chair beside me. even sir ralph passing by and the hard chacha lessons in PE couldn't take my mind off him. i just couldn't believewhat we did last sunday.   jammi and i talked for the whole afternoon. i received my first guitar lessons and we ended up doing it again. he started it, asking what i was wearing. needless to say, i was wearing pink[it so happens everytime he calls, i'm wearing pink]. then he joked me about liking it if i was wearing nothing. so i pretended to be serious about maybe being naked the next time we talked. i got so anxious when i realized one thing was leading to another. before i knew it, i was feeling the same rush of energy in me like before. after that, we both felt weird since we weren't supposed to do that anymore because we're no longer lovers. but, then again, i liked it.  the next day he called. after 20 minutes of helping me tune my guitar, he asked me to go online. his voice started to sound serious and i asked him why. he said he was gonna do his homework first so i insisted he do his work first. but then he told me it was my payment for the lessons and he was gonna tell me something important but he can't say it at that time. i was expecting him to say "i love you" and it made me too giddy. when i went online, he told me something that i don't think i can take. he said, after i said goodbye, he started smoking again and got involved in shipment of marijuana. he told me he didn't smoke pot but i was still upset. he said he wanted to let me know how disgusting he is as a person. i asked him why and his reply was, "cause i didn't wanna lie, worse, cause i care about you." but still, i didn't like him being like that. so when he told me to punish him, i told him to give me a call when he stopped.  bad decision... i miss him like hell...again... i just did it because i love him... so much...

      i can't believe jammi and i just did what we shouldn't have! we both found it weird actually. but, hey, it felt as good as before. he even taught me how to tune my guitar and one chord progression. i can play a bit already. i'm planning to learn "one and only you" the hidden track in parokya ni edgar's latest album. i wanna let jammi hear it... i miss him so much and he misses me, too.  i love him...i wonder if he loves me, too...

      tito cocoy and i went to watch a movie today. for the first time, we went to "the podium" to watch spiderman2. it was really cool! and peter parker is kinda cute [heehee]. we even won something at the end of the show because there was a raffle. i saw the sponsor's, warren, only son, robbin, he must've been 17 or so and he looked chinese and was kinda cute. he is so lucky because his dad named his toy company after him, "toys by robin". the move house was so cool. it small and that means good. there was even free food. then before we went home, we went into this bookshop and it was amazing there. the books were so nice but we were in a hurry so i plan on looking around some other time.   *** i'm finally getting the hang of my guitar. i've started to remember some chords but still can't play a song. i need jammi to teach me. speaking of jammi, i bet he's so angry at me he won't even call me. i can't believe i already missed two of his calls, the calls i always look forward to. i don't know how to play the guitar and i need him...not only for that...but i need him...

      just earlier this day, i was watching my friend, carla, playing her guitar not knowing a couple of hours later i'd have my own.  i came home quite late and bummed having missed jammi's call. i remembered my tito just came home cebu, the city if guitars, but he wasn't home the time i got home. i recall asking him to buy me a guitar but of course he refused. he insisted he won't buy something unnecessary. but when i was combing my hair in my room, our housemaidknocked at me door. no words could match my ecstacy whe i saw that black leather-like guitar case in her hand. i couldn't believe it! my tito actually bought me a guitar.  monique called afterwards and that was when i started to cry, being unable to control my joy. it was simply awesome! she was right, my tito really loves me. and guess what, i love him, too.  i thought it wouldbe easy to start on my own. turns out, it's really hard when i'm alone. i'm gonna wait for jammi to call and i'm probably gonna recieve his lessons. i just hope he's not too pissed off because i missed his call again. but, hey, we're not committed or anything.  i'm never gonna forget that it was my tito who bought me my first guitar. something i really really wanted. i've been saving for it and i didn't expect having one in a month or so. this is a dream come true!

      this day couldn't suck any more than it did...  fisrt, i found out that the badminton club of our school is totally useless. then my grandma used the internet and i wasn't able to talk to jammi...man, i'm so itching to tell him i love him.  *** ms. rubio was really pissed off today. i heard a girl named aretha from I4 wrote in a paper that ms. rubio had no sense of style and she's trying so hard to speak english. i heard she was on the verge of tears when she was scolding aretha. actually, i don't feel sorry for she. she kinda deserves it fo feeling too comfortable. but then again, maybe it was unfair of us to treat her like that. but she should cut us some slack, too.

      these past few days have sucked like hell! i don't know what's been up with me and why i'm so worked up. i'm not sure if it's PMS because i don't get that or maybe it's because i miss jammi so much. i haven't talked to him in a long while now and i'm worried he might be mad at me. hey, i'm trying to wait for his call and he doesn't call anyway. maybe he's busy or something. i just miss him so much and i feel so helpless [again]. it's so frustrating how he affects me so much. i guess my grandma was right that when you're in love, you're too involved sometimes. but i'd rather be like this and in love with him than be okay and still feel that weird searching for something.  school's been okay. it's our exams this week actually. our exams in THE was easy and also the one in religion. the one in social studies was kinda hard and it's our math exam tomorrow. i also forgot to get my filipino notebook so i have nothing to study for tomorrow. plus, i found out about our second quater shit in english and i already feel so challenged just thinking of it.  i've been okay with monique. i try not to think i'm irritated and i act coolly and normally and it just goes away. i guess i'm just in a bad mood lately that i've been starting to think i hate her or something.  drawing has been one of my passions lately. because carmina sks me to draw romantic scenes of her and pinggoy, her crush. whenever i draw, i always imagine it's jammi and i, walking, dancing, hanging around. i'm so missing him right now.  gian and i bought the latest album of our fave band, slapshock and it rocked like hell!!!! the songs were so inspirational and sad and so right for me! i love that band! i love their song, "miles away" coz it reminds me of jammi and i. he is a million miles away!  i can't believe my brother's having problems with girls. he keeps on telling me it's hard to be a chickboy because his two friends are kinda "fighting" over him. he's going on a research with sandra and then lunch with nica. it was supposed to be lunch with sandra but nica got so jealous that gian gave in. my god! he sounded really confused yesterday that it was kinda funny because it's so ironic. he's an expert with women and now he's having a dilemma, it's like he doesn't know what he's gonna do.

      this week had been so hectic!!!!  for the past days, i haven't been able to eat lunch at the right time because i had to stay in the library to do my research for our religion project which seems to be some kind of mini-thesis. i remember last wednesday, i had to eat my lunch under 3 minutes before the bell rang. then last thursday, i ate lunch after school. it was ok since i eat in class. i bring 2 sandwiches to school because i eat one during recess and the other during AP, ms. san andres doesn't see me anyway. i don't have a problem with my time of meal, i'm just surprised by how busy i am...and by how i'm coping with it. lately, i've been feeling kinda responsible. i actually did a "to do" list for the weekend! maybe it's because i found out how hard it is to be a senior because requirements flood their lives. i don't wanna die so i might as well practice now that i'm still a freshman.  i'm a member of the art committee in school and we had a project last week. we had to make posters for the campaign of the soda can drive. i participated a lot in that! i came up with 2 slogans, i brought materials and i attended almost every meeting! i guess i felt bound to that. i kinda miss being included in something like the magazine. i swear next year i'll be a staffer! anyway, i noticed that most of the active members of the artcom were freshmen. it was ok, though i'm not so satisfied by our products. it wasn't that good and i bet the student body wasn't that happy.  I met ate lia in that committee. She’s this pretty senior who was really kind to us. I like her because she’s responsible.  Yesterday was fun! We had a jamming session in the morning. 5 of us brought our guitars and it was fun! I guess guitar-playing is the new trend these times.

      Day I forgot…. i had a nice day today!  *** in english, we answered this exercise in our book. it was about subject-verb agreement but the questions are more of reflective ones. they asked about how we look at ourselves. they were pretty deep that they sent me thinking. the first question was, "how important is your presence here on earth?" i answered that i am equally important as everybody else. it is true. if we strip off everything, we're all just humans. no presidents, no royalties, no mass, no elites... just human beings. besides, i'm really not worth more than others [to be modest] and i'm not worth any less, too [being self-loving]. the next question i remember is, "when does friendship become a good investment?" i answered that it becomes a good investment when both parties benefit from the relationship. that's what friendships are for, right? do make each other better. but how come there are friendships when one is being used but it's okay with her? i've been in that kind and it was still a relationship. it may not be a perfect one but, hey, nothing's perfect. next, "why are people's live treasured?" they're treasured because each one tells a unique stroy. lives are like books in a library. the library is the world and without the books, the library wouldn't really exist.  a couple more thoughts came to me. it's about when people feel like doing good. let's face it, it's in man's nature to do good easily when he knows it would benefit him and he would be hesitant if he knows he wouldn't get anything from it. and also when a person comes to a crossraod. it's not exactly choosing from good and evil because there is no good and evil. only two sides standing for contrastng or different principles[concept from FFviii]. so it's just a matter of choosing which you will live by. and when you make a decision, you must live by it regardless of what people may say or odds may bring. when you make a decision, make it whole-heartedly and do it with a clear mind. analyze it well so you won't have regrets. sometimes, it's necessary to take risks to try if it's the right choice or just for fun [which is what i usually do]. risks will always be a 50-50 situation and if you fail, it will be lesson better than those which come from books.  *** tito charlie and mommy were talking about angelo dela cruz. they were debating. well, what can i say about it? i think that was a very unwise decision of GMA to retreat the Fili troops just for the life of one. if she really does value life, she wouldn't have done that. more lives are now at stake because the security in that place lessened all because of one man. for all we know, some other Filipinos have been killed secretly. why do they have to pull out our troops for this angelo dela cruz and not the others who were killed? and how come the press con of angelo dela cruz scripted? they must be hiding something. that is unfair to us, the citizens, and angelo because the truth may have been altered and what will become of us? if they can't be honest with these how much more on the economical issues? man, this country has issues....  *** i'm getting good at playing the guitar. my friends are helping me and i'm actually being helped! heehee....  *** god, i miss jammi so much!
