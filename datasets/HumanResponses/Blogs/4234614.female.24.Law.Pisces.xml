						   ... although not for me. I don't have classes on Monday this semester. Its nice to have summer vacation extended ... even if its just by one day.  I have finished all my reading, except I still have to do agency.  But that's not bad.  I'd like to re-read the article, though, for Theories because I didn't get much out of it. But, at least I have read everything other than agency through at least once. Trying to get off on the right foot.

						   I was surprisingly productive this afternoon. I went to Walmart and bought a food scale. Its not *real* accurate, but it's ok for estimating stuff. With tax it was under $5.00. It measures up to 16 oz. I went to CVS looking for one first, but they didn't have one. So then I went to evil Walmart instead. Of course being Walmart on a weekend, I stood in line for a good ten minutes in the 12 items or less line while people kept paying for $15 worth of purchases with a credit card . . . and of course I had to park ten million miles away (not that I care, can use the exercise).  After I got home, I poured out my honey nut cheerios into 1/2 cup servings and put them into baggies. I just like having them in nice handy sizes for when I run out the door to school. Around 3, I went outside and did all 49 pages of evidence reading. That's a long assignment. As usual for a long assigment, I couldn't pay much attention after about 30 pages. Really, 25-30 pages is all I can digest. Now I only have A&amp;P (agency and partnership) and my Theories of Justice reading to do. Theories looks like it may be interesting ... from the looks of it, more like an undergrad style discussion course. I am taking it to fulfill the perspective requirement.

						   Do you like my kingfishers over there in the corner? My best friend drew them and she's letting me use them on my blog. I love kingfishers. They aren't my *favorite* water bird (that honor goes to the brown pelican), but I do like them an awful lot. I think they dress up the blog. Or at least give you something real pretty to look at!  Whom I kidding. No one reads this thing but me. Oh well. Just more excuse to carry through more with my surfing theme and playing with the CSS of the template, I suppose.  Anyway, my family is going to a get-together on my mom's side and I'm not going 'cause I a) am anti-social (I am. I really am.) and b) I need to get some stuff done for the start of the school year. It sucks. So I am also on my own for dinner. Hopefully I won't burn down the house broiling fish.  Off to do some reading. I'm going to see how warm it is outside ... if it's nice enough, I'll do my evidence reading out there.

						   OK, so I tried to watch some of the Olympics last night on NBC and here are some musings ... a warning, they are completely random.    The one must-see thing I wanted to watch for the whole Olympics was the women's 100 meter final. So I tuned in to NBC. Figured it'd be on somewhere between 9 and 11. So I start watching NBC around 8 -- just in case it's on earlier than that. Suffer thru beach volleyball (ok, I'm sorry, that sport was just designed for males ... I spend most of my time flipping away watching the football game on another channel). I am happy to see the semis. Now looking forward to the finals. Then ... diving comes on .... and not diving finals, just pre-lim stuff. OK, well, I can live with diving. Not a big fan, but it's kind of a pretty sport. Diving finally ends. The American makes the final. Yay. Ok. Moving on. Track must be next, right? No, more .... swimming. Look at the clock ... it's 10:30. Where's the 100? I don't want to stay up all night. Mute the TV and do my CPT class reading. Look up from time to time to see what's on. More swimming. With no end in sight it appears. Finish reading. Swimming still on. Still no end in sight. It's after 11. Disappointed, but tired, I turn off the TV and go to sleep.  OK, I realize they want you to watch their whole broadcast, and that's why they put the signature event of the night on in the middle of the night. But, I have to say that really pisses me off. Same as baseball playing into the winter and so late at night. I will suffer through for baseball, but not for the Olympics. I probably won't watch much more of the Olympics. I was so pissed about the 100 being on so late that I pretty much plan to boycott the rest of the Olympics as far as tv goes.  Men's basketball ... we lost again? Yeah. So these aren't our "best" players (the "best" players apparently are too "good" -- read selfish -- to play for their country), but they aren't slouches in the pro game. So basically the performance --should I say farce?-- of the  men's team has just confirmed for me that I am not missing anything by never watching NBA basketball ... it's just a bunch of selfish thugs who really aren't that good and that don't know the game's fundamentals and who just aim to slam the ball and get on Sportscenter. Yeah. I'll pass, thanks.  Wow I just realized I did some law school work. Wow. I'm shocked and stunned. What the hell got into me?  Gymnastics bores me. To tears. Thankfully, I missed all of it.  I'd have liked to seen some horses. I remember as a little kid watching the 1984 games and only wanting to see the horses! I was a typical, horse-crazy girl.  Beach volleyball ... We have regular volleyball and we have beach. Um. OK. Does anyone really believe that beach volleyball exists for any other reason than to entertain the male of the species? Seriously. I couldn't even watch it. It was too ..... X-gameish. Not that the X Games are bad. They are good. But, beach volleyball at the Olympics? C'mon. No wonder ball room dancing thinks it has a shot at becoming an Olympic "sport."  Every time I watch the divers, I am afraid someone is going to hit their head on the platform. Seriously. It must happen (didn't Lougansis hit his head launching an AIDs controversy 'cause he didn't tell anyone he was HIV positive?). It must not be pretty. I think I'd be totally grossed out.  If NBC is working on a tape delay, which they are, then they could definitely do a better job. The coverage is .... disjointed. It's like they have ADD or something. And, you know, I'd like to see some other athletes than ours. I'm not saying don't give a lot of coverage to the US athletes, just that I'd like to see some of the other country's performers too.  How come they only show sports we are good at?   OK so that's my Olympics rant.  I still can't believe I did my CPT reading. Now I only have three more class assignments to do before Tuesday . . .

						   I just can't get interested in the Olympics this year. Maybe I will get interested now that track n field is starting, but I tend to doubt it with law school starting this week. It stinks that they start the Olympics so late in the summer.  I don't know why I am not interested. Maybe it is because the prime-time coverage isn't of live events. AOL keeps spoiling any suspense by announcing who won what. Or maybe its all the drug stuff ... it ticks me off that track is getting / has such a bad reputation for cheats.

						   ... of summer vacation before my 3L year starts. Am I ready for school? I guess I kind of am. I am looking forward to seeing my friends and it feels like it is about time to get back to school. I bought some legal pads and some high-liters and I pulled out my bag. I browsed through my reading for Copyright, Patent, Trademark (ok, that's way too long to write out, that class has just become CPT).  My summer was pretty lazy. Not as lazy as my 1L summer in which I did about a month's worth a work and the write-on competition for law review, but still pretty lazy. I worked the summer as a research assistant for a prof. I worked from home, just occasionally had to go in to get my time-sheet signed. I didn't make a lot of money (though with my spending habits I probably should have). I went to NJ twice. One abbreviated trip to Gettysburg -- got washed out after one day. Ran a lot. Did some of the cooking at home actually. Found I am not bad at cooking ... I guess I will not starve when I move out. Yes, I live at home still. Saves big money that way. I may be a loser for living at home, but it lessens the debt load and anything that helps lessen the debt is a good thing. Believe me. I'll put up with my folks and my little brothers for another year to cut down on how much I have to pay back.  All but my ABW class have assignments already. I am already procrastinating doing them.  At least the sun is finally out. I was considering building an ark after the past two days of non-stop rain.

						   A 2L came up to me the other day when I was buying books after over-hearing me talking to my friend ... he was saying he used his blue book to prop up his coffee table while I said that the only time I used mine was for the review. Anyway, the 2L wanted to know whether doing the review is worth it. There's some good advice on whether to do law review here:  urlLink Advice for the Law Lorn .  I would definitely recommend doing law review. Yeah, it is time consuming and sub-citing articles can be tiresome. And the entire process of writing a note is difficult and a lot of hard work. But, law review is prestigious and, like that article says, it will help you get a job.  A lot  of clerkships and firms give a great deal of consideration to law review membership. Some even require it. Law review is a nice plum for your resume.  Law review also helps you to become a much better writer. It sharpens your legal reasoning skills, your ability to cite just about anything under the sun, and it helps to teach you time managment. Furthermore, law review also lets you work with the best students at your school. Probably the ones who will someday be judges or policy makers.  So if you get invited to join the law review, I would do it.

						   I've been spending some time today (since it hasn't stopped raining and it was COLD -- 59!! in mid August) looking over law firms for the fall interview program (FIP). A couple observations . . .   Trying to figure out real differences in law firms from their websites is next to impossible.   Other than differences in what sorts of law the firms specialize in, the content of firm websites is remarkably alike. Granted, some are more detailed than others. A few seem a bit  too  detailed.  The websites even look the same ... same color schemes, same slick presentation, etc. Where's the love? *grin*   So I think probably what will happen is IF any law firm actually offers me an interview, then I will do some more indepth research into it. But I still got to do some research to decide how many firms I want to place bids with. So grrr.  I have come up with some generic questions to ask at interviews though. Here they are:   What's the pace of work like in your office or firm?  How many days a week do you leave the office by six o'clock?  What is the atmosphere of your office and the firm?  How does your firm give feedback to let associates know how they are doing?  Do lawyers mainly work alone or as teams on projects?  Why did you pick this law firm to work at as opposed to other firms you might have gotten offers from or considered?   And, then I am going to come up with something specific to the firm to ask to show I did some research. Since apparently all the FIP stuff says doing research is good. And I am sure I want to do what is good. Right?

						   If you're reading this blog, I guess you'd probably like to know a little about me. Well, here's "me" in a nutshell.   The Essential Info     I am 24 years old.  I am female.  I am a 3d year law student which means I am a member of the class of 2005.  I'm keeping my blog somewhat anonymous, though if you want to find out who I am, it's not that hard to do. I'm just not going to make it blantantly obvious.      Location    I live in Ohio. I was born and grew up here and did my under-grad here.  Its cold here 10 months out of the year. It snows a lot. There is no ocean. No surf. It is therefore depressing here.  No, Ohio is not all flat and farms. We have some hills and cities too.      Education    I did my under-grad at a small, Ohio liberal arts school. Take my word for it, you've never heard of it.  I double-majored in history and philosophy and double-minored in english literature and political science.  I managed to graduate magna cum laude (how I have no clue).  The law school I go to is located in Ohio.   My only law school activity is I am a member of the law review.    Jobs    I am a life-long student.  I've worked as a free-lance (for hire and volunteer) webmaster.  I worked in the art history department as an undergrad doing research and filing slides.  1L summer I interned for a month for a municipal court judge.  2L summer I worked as a research assistant to a professor.      Athletics    I still love surfing. Laird Hamilton is my favorite surfer.  I run seven miles nearly every day. I am a running addict. But I do much better in law school when I exercise.  I ran track in high school ... the 100, 200, and 4x100 relay outside, and the 55 inside. I set a school record in the 55 indoors. I got four letters.   I played soccer for many years and softball for a while too. Soccer is the reason for bad knees.  I like baseball. I follow football, tennis, and horse racing some too. Not really interested in hockey, college sports, or pro basketball. I don't like golf.      Hobbies    I am a huge Civil War buff with a 200 book library on the conflict.  I love music. Pearl Jam is my favorite band. I also play saxophone and was even a section leader as a junior and senior in marching band on alto (played tenor in symphonic band).   I raise cichlids ... I am an amateur aqauculturist and who also collects plecos.  I like to travel and visit beaches. Charleston, South Carolina is my favorite city.  I love birds and my favorite type is the brown pelican.   So anyway, there's the essential about me information ... Guaranteed to cure insomnia!

						      Confessions of a “Practical” Student     The reason I went to law school was simply because I could not find a job with my degree. The economy in 2002 was in shambles. I urge you not to go to law school for that reason.  If you go to law school, you should go because you have thought it over carefully and you love the law. When you go to law school, you enter into a marriage with the law. If you go with your eyes open and with a passion and love for the law in your heart, then you should do ok. It will not be easy – law school is not an easy path to take – but you should be able to weather the tough times and become stronger for it. My marriage with the law began on the wrong foot … and because of that, I ended up staring into an abyss and having the abyss stare right back and through – almost consuming -- me.  I had always sort of entertained the idea of law school – after all, I did like government and history and political science and all of those things were related at least tangentially to law – but, I never felt a deep passion for studying law or for becoming a lawyer. To me, it was just a vocation, like being a firefighter or a factory worker or a pharmacist. Something to do, something that paid well. But it was history and the Civil War excited me. Law … was boring, dry. My college professors urged me not to go, to go to graduate school instead. But I was consumed with being practical. The job outlook was far better for lawyers than for history majors. At least if I took out loans to pay for law school, I could someday pay them back … I wasn’t so sure about grad school in history.  So, I didn’t really want to go to law school for any reason other than I needed something to do and it seemed practical. But, I dreaded it. I had heard bad things about law school. The Socratic method. The work load of dry materials. The hours it would consume. (And, I had never even read 1L or seen the Paper Chase!) Because I didn’t really want to go, I spent the summer between college and law school browsing the classified ads in the paper, secretly hoping something better would pop up and give me an excuse not to go. Of course, the paper gave birth to no great job for a history major and Civil War buff. I resigned myself to try law school, comforting myself with the idea that maybe I could make good money as a lawyer and then, someday, I could pursue my passion for history.  So the law and I definitely got off on the wrong foot. I dutifully went off to law school when orientation came. The material was dry and boring, but I seemed to do ok with it. Still, law school seemed foreign and I was certain everyone was much smarter than me. I felt inadequate, tormented, and dumb. I resented some of my classmates for seeming so smart … particularly the ones who were so smug. Even making friends among my classmates didn’t relieve the terrible feelings of self-doubt. I never raised my hand. Although I felt inadequater, I usually did the bare minimum as far as reading, briefing, and assigments, resenting the time commitment demanded by the law. I perpetually rode a wave of liking the law at times and being interested in the material to being wiped out and feeling intellectually unstimulated, bored, and terribly apathetic. In the back of my mind, I was always planning my escape, what I would do when – not if -- I flunked out.  Fall exams came. My grades were surprisingly quite good, with one exception. Considering my apathy, you would not think I would care. But I did. What was wrong with me? Did I actually want to excel here? If so, why? Self-doubt began to torment me again. Grading seemed so … random. And, I had worked so hard actually studying for finals … and this was all there was to show for it? I hated my school … hated it for its curve, for its odd class schedule, for being a windowless, ugly tomb. Most of the second semester I was completely apathetic and by turns glum and ludicrious. Mostly, I neglected the law. Although I would do the bare minium – if for no other reason than pride and not wanting to look like an idiot if I got called on in class – I spent most of my time goofing off with my website or buying stuff online and surfing ebay. I didn’t try to find a summer job. I tried to calculate how I could escape from law school … how I could still find a job and escape from the snares of student loans.  I could not forumlate a good plan. I didn’t flunk out as a 2L. My grades were good enough to put me in the top 1/3 of the class – not bad. But, I still didn’t feel any love for the law. The marriage between me and the law had a very rocky first year.  My 1L year was the worst year of my life.  I couldn’t deal with another year like that. I couldn’t even look myself in the mirror. I felt tired, glum, apathetic, and disgusted with both myself and the law. It was time to think. A lot of self-reflection left me concluding that I didn’t want to be defeated by law school. I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and determined that, having picked this course, I needed to do my best or not be able to look at myself in the eye in the mirror.  So I decided I would need to become friends with the law. Even if it killed us both.  I started to run again, something I had given up before my 1L year, and I felt better. I observed in a judge’s chambers in municipal court for a month. I mostly enjoyed a break from the law. I think the separation helped heal some of the bad feelings. Slowly over the long course of the summer, I started to get interested in law.  Goaded by self-doubt and my new “interest” in law, I decided to try the summer writing competition for law review. The law review at my school is the top 10% of the class and a few write-on members. I’ve been told I’m a decent writer. And I was not THAT far off the top 10% (it wasn’t like I was last in my class or anything). And, scholarly work interested me. So why not try? If nothing else, law review would give a little bit of presitige to my resume and maybe open some doors. I plunked down the money and purachsed the huge packet – it was to be a closed universe assigment so there was no outside research involved. The assigment was to write a case comment on Newdow – that’s the case that came out of the 9th circuit challenging the consitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance. It was actually interesting. I waded right in and managed to write what I thought was a decent case comment. I turned it in and hoped for the best, mostly expecting to be turned down. But, lo and behold, the law review chose me.  I went back to school still with some self-doubt, but it has gradually faded. I liked my 2L courses much better than my 1L courses. I don’t dread going to school like I did when I was a 1L. I even occasionally raise my hand in class. I feel a little more confident in my abilities and more comfortable. Most importantly, I can look myself in the eye.  The law and me … we’re now good friends. There’s still no love there – I’m sure that’s partly because of sore feelings from 1L year – but it’s possible some day there may be a little love between the law and me.
