      Holy shit driving is scary. I just picked up my government car and I'm driving like an old grandma. Maybe it's the rain, or the fact that I do not know my way around this city AT ALL. It's been a good year and a half since I've been behind the wheel. But sheesh. I used to be the queen of the road.  Now I'm just riding the brakes.  I know I'll get back on track.

      I think I might have stumbled upon a super awesome job.  Today I was in the oldest building in Alberta. It was the Father Lacombe Chapel in St. Albert. It's 146 years old, built entirely without nails, and haunted (oohhhhh). Behind the chapel is the crypt, which unfortunately, not as cool as it sounds. Father Lacombe and two other Catholic priests are kept in there, but the eighties has taken it's cruel, cruel toll on the tombs. It seems like the crypt atmosphere scared off potential tourists - so they covered the stone with stucco and wood panelling. For real.  Behind the crypt is the grotto, constructed stone by stone by the church parishoners, who each brought a huge rock with them to church every week until the structure was complete. (it's kind of an outside/inside prayer area with statues of Mary and Jesus) Apparently when school children come to tour the facility, they are not allowed near the grotto - due to the fear of teaching Christianity in public schools. This is interesting to me. On one hand, I agree, because religion is a personal choice. But unfortunately our history is steeped in Christianity and we can't erase that....besides, it's a pretty cool structure.  No haunted chapel would be complete without a cemetary. Not only does the cemetary have a section for babies and young children, there is also a mysterious mass grave site (with no markings) as well as the grave of a woman who was nearly buried alive. The story is true. The woman - Sara - came down with some mysterious illness and was unable to move or speak. She recalls listening in at her own funeral and saved herself by wiggling her fingers while someone was paying their last respects. She lived for 40 more years and is buried in the very plot that she was almost trapped in.  I learned all of this today as part of my job. I guess I'm getting paid by the government of Alberta to visit all of these historical sites - from the oil sands in Fort MacMurray to the dinosaur bones in Drumheller. They also give me a car to get there, a cell phone to "stay in touch", as well as pay for all my meals and hotel bills (if necessary). That means I can drink as many soy latte's as I can get my lucky little hands on.....

      My aunt told me today that friends aren't everything, and, one day when I'm more professional I will say "piss on the way I used to live".  She basically said that the way I live is bullshit, and that, "mark her words", I'll grow out of it.  God, it's like the twilight zone here. Families are so, so fucked up. Sometimes I wake up, and I just want to run away screaming.  Do you ever feel like you're just constantly starting over?

      Man. I am just so tired of other people's inability to accept the fact that I don't like eating certain foods. I've been struggling with this for years and years and I just don't understand why people just don't mind their own business.  My dad is making me feel super guilty because he wants to order pizza and I don't want to eat any. What, it's lame to eat pizza by yourself? If I wanted some food I would just order it. I eat sushi, and brocolli, and chocolate bars by myself every day. I don't guilt people about not eating those things with me or try to make them eat it too, or ask them a million different questions about why they won't eat it, only to call a few people and talk loudly on the phone, inviting them over to eat the said foods with me.  God, I feel so bad that I'm getting so frustrated here because I really like my dad, but he doesn't listen to a god damn word I say. He'll talk all day about whatever and I listen, but as soon as I point out something that I like, or try and talk about a movie, or about anything for that matter - he instantly changes the subject. Instantly. Like, after I say two words.   Oh yeah. I yelled at a little kid today outside my house. Ha ha.

      It's funny how smells come back at you from deep in your past and remind you of things.  I just washed my hands with a bar of Irish Springs soap and when I smelled them (my hands, not the springs) I was instantly reminded of my first boyfriend - Ben. I didn't know it then, but I pretty sure he used this very soap.  Ahhhhh.....soapy memories.

      I went to West Edmonton Mall today for something to do and found myself at the door of the "haunted castle" in Fantasyland. I really dig that kind of stuff so I finished my coffee and went inside.  I made it to the werewolf....and then I was too scared to go on. For real. I'm not ashamed but I still really want to go because it's super fun.   I guess I'll just have to find a date...

      I awoke early this morning to the sound of a woman screaming. I really don't know if it was a dream or if it was real. Maybe it was my scream.  I fell back asleep and dreamt that I was in Ikea, only it wasn't Ikea, it was some kind of junky store. I was trying to steal a cover for my thermos because I lost mine somehow. I got totally busted and ended up telling the girl that worked in the store that I was looking for birthday supplies. She brought back all of this stationary, pink pencils, and shitty grab bag type toys. I ditched everything and eyed some bubble gum  that had asian pin up girl stickers in every piece.  I left without buying anything. That's all I remember.

      Edmonton is a crazy town. I just spent the last few hours of my life at West Edmonton Mall, purportedly the biggest mall in the world. And I believe it because I got so, so lost there.  I went to see Van Helsing and the jerks wouldn't let me in with my stupid coffee. It was probably for the best because it allowed me time to smoke some weed first, which ended up being a god send. Man was that a disappointing movie. The only part I really liked was the opening sequence in black and white. The story was unlikable and the CGI was just too over the top. I think that someone like F.F. Copolla should have directed it. The low key style of Dracula is what made it so stunning.  Furthering on the topic of Count Dracula, I saw a movie called "Shadow of the Vampire" today and it was absolutely incredible. It stars John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe and is about the making of the movie Nosferatu. It was actually brilliant.   So yeah. After the movie (and getting lost once more) I ended up in the WEM bus transfer station with about 15 super high young teenagers who were screaming about how great they were for being "brown" (native), calling everyone whitey, and picking fights with each other. Here I am, no jacket, skin tight jeans and a studded belt, reading "the Idiot" by Dostoyevsky. But for some reason, and I notice this in MTL too, I have some kind of unspoken agreement with the thugs. Those kind of kids never ever bother me. It think it's because I don't give them dirty looks. I'm so guilty of acting crazy in public places, especially as a punk-rocker teenager.  Since I got so lost in the mall, I missed my bus and had to wait an hour for the next one. During that time it started to snow. Man this place is weirder than I remember.   urlLink    the white stuff is snow...&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    see?&nbsp; urlLink

      So I woke up this morning and I didn't know where I was. I closed my eyes and was immediately returned to the Interzone - my dream space. I was about to crawl into this super scary amusment park ride that operated by condensing the molucules in the body somehow and cramming them into this cylindrical tube. Once in tube form the ride would throw the tube/body up into the air over and over and over again, catching it in this see through receptacle each time. Peoples bodies were unrecognizable but I somehow knew inherently that the matter was human - someone I knew even. I really didn't want to go on the ride but for some reason I had no options and I didn't even really struggle. But I did know that the experience was going to be really really bad for some reason. I woke up again just as I was climbing into the machine....  I was in my Aunt's house across town, sleeping on the futon. I was wearing white cotton winnie the pooh pajamas (really) and it was 8 a.m. (ahhh). I guess I just stayed there last night after helping my cousin do some really mindless paper sorting and filing. Ok. I wasn't just helping, I was just doing it all. My cousin lured me in with $20 and free food. Let's just say I've been kind of slumming it for the past few days. I haven't even been wearing clothes because I don't leave the house anymore (except to go to the "Happy Mart" across the street to buy a chocolate bar every single day.) It's funny because it takes me an hour to get ready to go into that store. I figure that since it's the only place I really go, I'd better look my best.   urlLink    .&nbsp; urlLink     **I hate to say that I'm being dead serious here**  My horoscope says that I should try new things though - so I think tonight I am going to go see "the Corporation" at the Princess Theatre on Whyte Ave. I'm actually scared because I think that I've forgotten how to talk to people. But I really want to make some friends here and being an awkward loner has gotten me nothing but paranoia lately.  It sucks because I went on this crazy bike ride the other day and actually saw someone I knew from when I lived in Calgary. But I was so sweaty (and he's so cute) that I didn't want to stop and scare him by acting weird and smelly. So I just rode on by and now I wish that I would have actually just stopped. Maybe he'll be at NOMEANSNO tomorrow......*sigh*

      Ha. I have this new found intense respect for Justin Timberlake. I’m watching this special on him on MTV and it’s pretty fucked up. I took a picture of myself watching the program and I made it kind of look like I’m a zombie (by accident).  urlLink    justify it&nbsp; urlLink      but Justin is cool shit anyway.  Yeah, pretty much all I’ve been doing is taking pictures of myself over the past few days. And watching tv. Fuck. I saw Peaches on SexTv today and she was talking about recording her first album in her bedroom. She said all that she did during that time was smoke weed, sleep, masturbate, and watch tv. Which is precisely what I am doing with my life right now. I wish I was recording an album of some sort.  I had this super fucked up idea in the shower this morning about how maybe I died on the plane ride coming over to Edmonton and now I’m stuck in some sort of weird limbo. Cut off from the world but still in the world. Like in that movie The Others. It started freaking me out because I am really afraid of ghosts and last night I became super paranoid about my house being haunted and couldn’t sleep. So this morning I got to thinking, what if I’m the one that’s dead. What if I’m just going to be stuck here in this house forever and ever. I went downtown yesterday and felt absolutely invisible. Fuck, I hope I’m not becoming invisible.  Oh. Typing is making my arms tired. I’ve started lifting weights almost constantly while I watch tv. But it’s tiring me out.

      Holy shit. Insane 18 km bike ride today. I went all the way to Whyte Ave. just for a fucking coffee. I was so cracked by the time I got there I think the girl in Second Cup must’ve thought I was on acid. I kept on telling her that I was really confused and I was walking all funny because my legs were all jello-y.   I forgot how many cute boys there are in Alberta. Really. It’s insane. Man, I kind of do feel like I’m on acid or mushrooms or something right now. I feel completely disembodied. Like my arms aren’t attached to my brain at all. Shit.  I’m going to have to finish this later.   urlLink    cleanliness is next to (un)godliness&nbsp; urlLink

      I swallowed a bug yesterday. Or was it the day before? My days are blending into one long string of events, fuelled by coffee.  I can’t seem to do anything without drinking a perpetually lukewarm coffee first. Including taking a shit. Fuck.  So I guess this is my weblog. I’m not even hooked up to the internet yet but I am so fucking bored right now I thought I start it sooner. Right now I’m sitting in my new house (well, my dad’s new house, where he is traditionally absent) watching satellite all day and trying to make as big a mess as possible, just so I’ll have something to do later. I’m actually waiting for my aunt to stop by and deliver me some weed that my dad bought for me from my native cousin’s girlfriend because I’m so fucking bored.  The Pet Shop Boys say only boring people are bored and I used to believe that but now I definitely don’t. I’m somewhere in the city of Edmonton. I don’t have any friends here and my family is super weird (see above) and it snowed yesterday. My borrowed bike has shit for brakes and I was not about to go out riding around and getting lost in the snow. Let’s just say I have absolutely no idea really where I am or what I am doing here. And it looks like I’ll be doing this until the 17th. I think it’s the 5th or 6th today. I kind of don’t want to know.   I just keep listening to Dracula’s Wedding over and over and over again and watching SexTv. I just can’t believe what they are allowed to show on tv these days. I saw some serious softcore threesome action the other night and actually got turned on by it. I’m not sure if I’m ever going to have sex ever ever again, especially since I haven’t even spoken one word to anyone in three days. I might as well be in Siberia right now. And if it is actually possible (and it is) my chances for sex are actually going to go down once I start working. Not only will I be living in segregated dorms, but both my brother and dad are going to be on the same jobsite as me and I don’t want them to know how easy I am.   It’s bad enough that my dad is buying me drugs.  I feel like a terrible daughter.     words: Less Than Zero Bret Easton Ellis sounds: Satisfaction (I Can’t Get No) Devo

      I saw the sun rise this morning. I was driving my dad's HUGE truck down the number 2, coming back from the airport in the dense, coolwhip fog.  I don't really understand now how people find sunrise/sets so romantic. I could barely even look, it was so orange and bright. The feeling of calm, or beauty I was expecting was definetely stunted by the piercing, eye scorching pain I get from staring at the sun. Maybe it's just me.....

      i had a memory today of the way i used to think of things when i was a small girl.  i grew up on the prairies, but they weren't as you would think. there were a lot of hilly areas, dense forests, and sloughs that had a layer of scum on them that was so thick and green it looked like you could walk right across it. i spent most of my childhood summers falling trees for teepees, collecting dried up coyote skulls, eating saskatoon berries, and climbing through barbed wire fences. i remember driving through the woods at night, with no light but the moon and the car headlights illuminating the gravel road ahead. i was mesmerized by the headlights sweeping past the forest on the sides of the road, leaving nothing but blackness and the stars behind them. i used to think that i was putting the forest to bed, saying goodnight to the trees and animals within. like a silent midnight watcher.  my brother always fell asleep, but i was electrified, peering out the window, shutting my eyes tight if a car was to pass by. i liked to feel the burning light streak through my eyelids, weaving a path across my face and disappearing into the night beyond.   it wasn't just magic to me. even now i feel uneasy in the forest at night. not because of fear, but from the feeling that i'm keeping something special from taking place.....

      friendship sure is a tricky business. i feel right now like i've thrown everything away. i'm in hot pursuit of something and i don't even know what it is. this summer is like a roller coaster for me. i've never actually been away from something that i miss so much. i miss my metropolitan life, my midnight wanders, all night breakfasts, kids laughing in a language i don't understand, i miss having someone to watch a movie with, or an argument... right now i feel like i'm in hiding. i'm constructing a whole universe inside my head and it's starting to crumble. i feel like i've alienated people i don't even know. i've always been convinced that other people find me strange, but things are getting out of hand now. i just want to press the "off" button and make everything go back to normal. but there is nothing to go back to. i've been covering my tracks and i didn't even know it. i want to leave the forest but i don't know how i got here. instead of leaving a trail of breadcrumbs, i fed them to the birds instead. my feet are soaked now and i'm getting cold. the summer is just another square of room now, like tv or computer. i'm just a spectator, not one of the screaming voices, growl of engine, or morning conversation that penetrates the glass. i hear the rustling sound, feel the reflective green, but i cannot see the leaves one by one by one....

      wow. i get the crown for being the biggest piece of shit ever today.   my dad gave me money to put on my credit card so he could book a plane ticket. immediately after the money went through, i found out that my card was cancelled. there's nothing like the feeling of being a huge disappointment to your dad.  add that to the fact that i just realized i think i'm being obsessive about certain aspects of my life, and completely irresponsible about others and i have a pretty little shit sceptre to wave around too.  errrrggg.

      i saw an accident on the highway this morning. it must have happened less than 2 minutes before i drove by. a silver car had flipped over a guard rail and down an embankment. i was stopped behind a dump truck that had stopped to survey the scene. as i waited i saw a woman crawling out of the drivers seat, only to slouch on the down on the bank beside her overturned car, head in hands. people were rushing down to help her, others were standing by with cell phones. a woman in a white minivan ran across the road, hands cupped over her mouth. she must have seen the accident happen. i was on my way to work and i couldn't stop. there were so many other people there, frantic. i didn't want to be part of a crowd.

      wow. this is turning into sandra/s dream time post. but since i feel that i am publishing this blog exclusively for janice, i don't see that it matters that much. considering the fact that usually the weirdest or most exciting things that happen to me in any given day are while i am sleeping.   there's nothing self depreciating about the truth.  when i woke up this morning i had the distinct impression that i had spent the night next to someone. in their arms, in my arms, i feel as though i dreamt of being asleep. it was so real of a feeling i had to open my eyes to see that no one was there. it felt great though, because last night i went to bed longing for that very experience. i can't remember the last time i actually "slept" with someone, not just had sex with them, or woken up hungover beside them. and right now i really really want that in my life. it's a different kind of loneliness, the yearning for acutal human contact. talking to people is not as fufilling as being touched by them, and just anyone is not good enough. i want "the" one. by the one i mean the one right now, not the one forever. i want to be excited again...

      Last night I dreamt that I stir-fried my clothes in BBQ sauce. The first thing I ate was a Harley Davidson shirt. I moved on to an argyle sock that my friend Patrick left in my room and it was really hard to eat. I distinctly remember trying to swallow it because I was in a hurry to meet someone (it was Ali....) but she ended up leaving anyway.  I think maybe I chewed on my blanket a little.

      Although my night was not as fucked up as I hoped it would be, it was still unexpectedly strange.  My cousin (a source of unending grief for me) called me this evening because she wanted a favour of sorts. She told me the other day that she had been talking with this guy on the phone who she had never met. When I asked her how she met him, she said that she dialed the wrong number one time and just ended up talking to this guy. I figured that it was an unlikely story, but let it slide. So tonight she calls me and says that he's asked her to meet him and some of his friends at the bar where he works, so they can finally talk in person. Now, in most normal circumstances, this would be kind of a fun situation. The only thing is, my cousin is fat. Ok, obese. Which is fine. I could really care less, except for the fact that she's a bitch. I am absolutely positive that she hasn't told this guy either of these things, but I figured that this scene would at least amuse me. We show up to the bar, and I spot him immediately. Honestly. He's kind of a loser. Well, by my standards. Bad sideburns, bad style, and his friend was wearing a trench coat. I pointed the guy out to her but she didn't want to talk to him, she wanted to wait, make sure he was really the guy..or whatever. I finally asked her how she actually met this dude and she told me that they had been leaving messages for each other on one of those adult chat lines. I actually didn't know that people really called those things. It kind of made me sad because I grew up with my cousin, and I didn't know that she was lonely that way. As we were sitting at our table, all of these army guys started to filter in, and eventually I was so distracted by looking at them that I could barely even hold a conversation with my cousin. I kept on looking all around and stopping in the middle of sentences, or words. **my cousin wasn't the only desperate loser out tonight.** After awhile I started to get bored. I talked my cousin into saying hi to this guy at least. We approached his table and she didn't even introduce herself. She just bitchly said hello and stared at him. It was excruciating. He had no idea who she was. Finally I introduced them and we sat down. The guy talked to me the entire time. I kind of feel bad now. At least I wasn't interested in him. In fact, I kept on looking away, really obviously just to force my cousin to talk to him. But she couldn't. It was awful....and I loved it.

      i just have to say that as frustrated as i am with my current situation, i have never in my life been more excited about my life than i am&nbsp;now. i guess this has been a personal journey for me in the way that i've gotten a clearer perception of what's really important in my life, what i can look forward too, and what i can finally say farewell to... i lay in bed at night, dreaming about all the things that i'm going to do, now with the realization that i actually can&nbsp;live those ambitions. that nothing can really hold me back anymore.  and besides....i have less than one month to go....

      wow. it's funny how redemption song fills me with feelings of regret and sadness. whenever i hear the song i thing of my long-lost friend jordan.  i've been thinking a lot lately about relationships and what kinds of them i want in my life. since i've&nbsp;been in alberta i've had a lot of memories of my days in calgary. i had a lot of love interests back then and i didn't want any of them. whenever anyone tried to get close to me i would just hurt them really really bad and walk away....slowly.  &nbsp;  jordan used to sing bob marley as loud as he could every night over several pitchers of beer at the castle pub. he's the only guy i've ever had sex with in a car. he spent&nbsp;the night once in the bed i shared with my boyfriend and i kicked him out before my boyfriend came back. i didn't even feel like i was doing anything wrong. i had just built this world up in my head and i was living in it. i'm pretty sure i thought that no one had a clue what i was doing.  &nbsp;  i fucked with jordan really really bad. i eventually got bored of him and just stopped calling.  &nbsp;  i just feel like i must have been so blind to everything back then. i was dumped for the first time in my life about&nbsp;a year later and i remember being absolutely floored by the whole experience. i just really wanted everyone to love me, with no strings attached and no commitment. i think i still want that, only they've all stopped calling.....  &nbsp;

      just a peak at my horoscope for the next couple weeks. i didn't know i felt like this until i read it. fuck: &nbsp;    This may be a very discouraging time. Your vital energies are at a twenty-nine-year low, and you may feel quite incapable of dealing with the adversities that often accompany this influence. You may feel physically tired, as if the burdens of your life are too much for you. Quite commonly during this time people feel old, even if they are in fact young, and there is a profound sense of world-weariness. This period is best dealt with by understanding that it is part of a natural cycle in your life. Nothing is gained by fighting it; instead you must learn to flow with it. This influence represents a period of endings, which will be followed by new beginnings. The problem is to avoid being discouraged and frustrated by the endings. Soon you will have the opportunity to begin new projects that will build up to new peaks of achievement in about fourteen years.  ( urlLink www.astro.com )

      last night i was marooned in the second oldest building in alberta; a methodist church, built in the 1890's. i was stranded by one of the worst storms in my memory in the old Husdons Bay trading post known as Victoria Settlement.  the assistant fire marshall called to warn us there were tornados brewing nearby. we already knew; funnel clouds are easy to spot in the praries, and we were surrounded. we were lucky though, the clerks quarters had a 12 foot deep earthen cellar - the safest place for us on site. earlier in the day i spent some time in the cellar, and as footsteps echoed overhead, i tried to imagine what it must have been like to hide down there. it was the type of cold and silent only found deep underground.  i spent the most vicious part of the storm sitting cross legged in a large traditional Cree teepee. the smoke flap and front door were partially open, allowing for gumball sized hail and flashes from the sky above to enter. the air was constantly rumbling with the sound of thunder, and the rhythmic noise of hail hitting the wood and buckskin. i laid my head down on a bison skull and listened to local ghost stories, my jeans soaking in the dampness from the flatteed grass, my hair and glasses wet from the mad dash for cover.  my guide told me about a Metis girl who appears every spring, dressed in buckskin, hair in braids. she runs playfully through the settlement, and after a second glance she's gone; until the spring comes again.   sometimes at dusk, a Cree chief walks the plains at the crest of the hill, near his gravesite, searching for his long lost tribe.  they may have been ambushed by an ancient Blackfoot tribe, who also took the lives of the settlers, including the cleric. we felt their ominous presence on a midnight trip to the graveyard where the victims were buried, causing us to stop dead in our tracks and supress the urge to run back to the camp in the unpenetrable blackness of the prarie night.  the clouds obscured everything but the only two constellations i know, the big dipper and cassiopia. as i walked i wondered how many girls my age had walked that muddy path, searching for the stars as i did that night.

      i'm think that i'm becoming socially retarded. no really... its just that i rarely talk to people my own age, and even rarer that they're into the same kind of things that i'm into.  i had a hair appointment today with someone totally cool. normally this would be no big deal, but lately when i get the opportunity to converse, i kind of just talk and talk and talk. like a little kid. i'm the kind of person who likes to talk to people but it's just getting all pent up inside.  i walk away feeling like some kind of weirdo who talks too much. i don't know how i can change this right now, but i'm sick of telling myself to shut up.... i hate realizing new things about myself that i don't like.

      i've been working out a bit lately. ok, a lot. i noticed something kind of weird today. my body is starting to change. like, physically change. i know that that's what happens when you exercise but i wasn't really prepared for it. this body that i've grown so used to is eventually going to be pretty different. it's already started.  it reminds me of how i felt when i got my braces taken off. i knew it was inevitable, and i knew that i would look better because of it, but i still felt this weird sense of loss.  and now i'm not sure anymore if i'm still the underdog, if i ever was, or if i just want to be like everyone else...

      i'm lying awake again. completely still, every bone, every fibre. i feel each individual cilia, straining, aching for a sound. a vibratory mix of ecstasy and fear. i pile things at my door before so it can't be opened, only to move them and peek out one last time. this house is either settling, or restless. i know the feeing.

      there were fireworks last night. i lay awake, pretending the city was under attack and i was hiding away in a closet. it was still light outside, like the glow of afterburn. i tried to imagine everyone's faces, blue and yellow, joyful. their absurd drop jawed smiles, watching the city burn.  my mind was absolutely racing. i couldn't even remember what i was thinking from one moment to the next.   i woke up, and opened all the windows in the house. like a sleepwalker i went downstairs and drank all the orange juice, throwing the container down on the carpet.  now i'm dizzy and i can't remember the last time i went for coffee with someone....
