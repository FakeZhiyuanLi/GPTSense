      Today is a nice day. Although I got up at 8.45 am. I went for a 1 hour run with Erik which was a ton of fun. Now it's 10.50 and normally I'd still be in bed, dreaming...but now I'm already don exercising and I just have so much more time to get things done. The only thing is that all my friends are probably still sleeping, so I better not call you guys lol Man such a great day. This is gonna be the best weekend ever. Family gone, just Erik staying home but he doesn't care about stuff haha *yay*  Last night was fun just lying in that park and watching stars. The only bad thing about stars is that they make me think. Too much. And when I think too much I start worrying about things. Yesterday was just a night that made me realize -again- that I don't want to go home. Back to Germany. I wanted this night to never end because it was just such a good feeling to lie there with you guys and having pointless but entertaining conversations, and just enjoy spending the time with you guys.  What is life gonna be like in 6 months? That's what I was thinking about yesterday. We all know that I worry too much about not being able to keep in touch with all of you for whatever reason. But I hope that once I come back to visit you, we'll be lying in that park again, like yesterday, watching the stars, and having pointless but entertaining conversations and play "Who wants to be a millionaire" (SP lol) with Drew's phone.

      I hate people who don't plan in advance or change plans the last second and then don't even let me know. God this day was weird. Sorry Kati, I know it's your birthday so- Happy birthday again but hey it just sucks if you think you have a plan for a really good day figured out and then suddenly everything changes and it turns out to be one of these days that's not great but not awful either. One of these days you think too much about stuff, you get worried about stuff too easily and the result - headache. Oh well what are you gonna do but I must say, i just HATE when that happens.  You don't know what people think about you. Are they mad, are they cool with what you're doing or do they just not really care? Makes me feel so bad. I don't know what to hink. I hate when I don't know what people think about me. But I definetely feel bad. Ditched the same person two freaking days in a row. And I can't even do anything about it because it just happened...so I just feel bad....and think. Think too much and get worried about things that I actually know I don't have to worry about because the person I worry about isn't like other persons in my past. Why do I keep forgetting that there are people that actually love me because I'm me? Because of weirdos in my past. Why do I keep forgetting that people don't want to change me? Because of weirdos in my past. Why do I keep forgetting that there are people out there who actually really don't give a shit about what I look like? Because of weirdos in my past. Holy shit, you guys must think I had a terrible past but that's not what it is....just a few persons who influenced me too much. I try to not forget what the people are like that I know now. I just can't help it. Lol the funny part about this blog is that probably no one will understand what the hell I'm talking about. Haha kinda funny. Anyway, gotta go now, see you guys later hopefully because you make me feel better =)

      Lol Kate well wasn't that fun? Haha most random night ever...going to Cub Foods with a fake snake in my purse and buying the weirdest stuff we could find...oh man we got the creepiest looks from everyone because of my snake and then we bought things like Marshmellow Pies (very American haha) which were just absolutely awful but well I ate it anyway because it's like one of those kinds of food where you can't wuite decide if you like it at first but then after a while you're like "OMG I can't believe I just ate that!" Very funny. And we were followed by Josh who was smelling like pot and he didn't leave us alone until we just went off into another isle and acted like he wasn't there. Man he was strange. Talking about his pole stick (lol) for $150...what a weird kid! Anyway we had fun looking for weird stuff with the snake in my purse. The lady at the checkout tried really hard not to laugh and I did too but the people who know me know that this usually doesn't work haha. Yeah we were cracking up. But Kate could at least hide it a little better. Anyway, then we got home and microwaved this tight soup at my house, ate a weird cherry pies which was basically disgusting and then...the highlight of the night: Of course, it was alreade 11.10pm. So my Dad comes downstairs and just kicks Kate out of my house. "Kate I have to ask you to leave now I have to get up at 6 tomorrow" Great weirdo like I would care! Well yeah she had to leave but luckily Drew arrived just as she was leaving the house so I didn't feel too bad because you had someone to hang out with for the rest of the night. Oh man that was embarassing though. So sorry again Kate. We all know about my Dad by now so it acutally wasn't that big of a surprise. Oh and I think we should write to Nesquick and complain about your sour chocolate mElk =) They can't do that, just print "best before Aug 26" on the label and then sell it to innocent customers who are looking forward to drinking that nice chocolate milk....evil people! So yeah maybe that's what we should do tomorrow. And while we're at it, let's write to Little Debbie and complain about how disgusting the Marshmellow Pies are. Oh and let's write to Cub too because they don't have good scones. Man, so many evil people in this world!  OK so this was my great Father's Day's night. Not talking about the morning. Very annoying. Brittany's party was cool though. Dairy Queen *yum* and other cool stuff. Oh and thumbs down to the band that was supposed to play at Wolfe Park again. You guys suck! At first you pack up at 11 on Friday, then your little kid tells DH he needs a haricut and the sister is all evil anyway...and then when we are nice enough to be willing to check you guys playing out again tonight, you are packing all your stuff up again, this time at 9.30! More evil people! Damn it, maybe I'm living in the wrong world...to many evil people here...but on the other hand...nopt, too many nice people too so ok I'm gonna stay.  The word of the night lol See you tomorrow

      Except for those freakin mosquitos! God I hate them! My right knee is about 4/3 the size it should be lol and everything is itching..not good not good.  But hey camping with you guys was so much fun and I learned a lot about everyone's life (especially one category lol) which was pretty interesting.  My personal highlight: Taking a shower in the rain after a sweaty hike and swimming in stinky water. Man that was great. PLaying Twister in the rain was also a lot of fun. Actually everything we did in the rain was fun. Except for when it didn't stop raining for 3 entire hours and we had to sit in our tent, play truth (dare didn't really work since it was in a tent lol) and I annoyed Pepsi and Chilchz with my cool rabbit story that I am gonna post here some time when I'm really bored. Oh Chelsea I hope you're not mad at us any more because we woke you up with the Joe-game. Lol that's kind of embarassing but what are you gonna do we were just bored ^^ We totally THUGGED the first day though. Yeah we THUGGED it Chelsea. Lol that was funny when you tried to talk like Annydizzel. Anyway, Kate and I are definetely the pros. We put that tent up in about 20 minutes without even knwing what it should look like in the end. *yay* Yeah we pimped that. German and American teamwork. Oh no wait I'm not even German any more, I just got my greencard today from Donnie. Thx Donnie =) Acutally it was because I tripped him when we were trying to play soccer...at least I was trying he actually did it but anyway since we didn't have anything yellow I just got a grrencard and now I can stay here forever hahaha. Good story isn't it? Anyway what else was there when we were camping...nothing that I should write here I guess. So over all it was a blast.  And now I'm home again at 11.28 on a Thursday night during break like a loser. MMMhh maybe I should listen to Scott ->REVOLUTION I'm gonna write again tomorrow enough for now see ya'll

      11.00 on a Monday night DURING break. Most of the people I know are still out somewhere, enjoying themselves, enjoying the free time without any school, and just having a ton of fun. Not me though. No why would I be out there with my friends right now, cruising around in the car, yelling at random people out of the window??  Most ridiculous thing ever. First my Dad and I fight the whole way from Park to Lone Lake in Hopkins about how I "pushed my curfew" (oh yeah I really pushed it, I mean, yeah I was about 15 minutes late yesterday and the day before holy shit I shall be in hell forever) and then when I get out of the car my Dad appaerently doesn't want me to leave all pissed so he's like:"But keep in mind, I still love you." Yeah right how much more ironic can this get? So of course that made me even more pissed...his whole "oh I'm such a good Dad and I love Kathrin so much blah blah" thing just pisses me off so much and he doesn't even notice that I'm sick of this outward appearence -I'm-so-nice-bullshit.  Well yeah then I went to Donnie's soccer game and was talking to his Dad and that made me realize that there are actually nice parents out there. After the game we picked up Kate, Scott, and Drew and I was having so much fun with my friends and I could just forget all the stress my Dad made me. It was just great. I mean, whenever I'm with my friends, I can't be in a bad mood. That's just so awesome. We went to Whitecastle and I ate one of those nasty "grease-patty-sandwiches" lol just because it can be so much fun to just eat junk sometimes.  Well but after all I still had to be home by 11 so my Dad can sleep *LOL* So as I get in my room, there is a letter sitting on my bed...check this out it's really funny:  Kathrin, I wasn't very clear about something. An 11:00 curfew on weekday nights is not a punishment. It is the same time we have for Evan this year and we had for Erik last year. With all of the happenings last week we didn't get a chance to talk with you about it. You haven't done anything wrong. I just don't like to have the limits start to be pushed and thus my request to stick to the curfew. (I get enough of "pushing the limits" from Paul.) PLease hang in there with us. I love you! Dad  Lol is the only thing I'm thinking right now. What the fuck does he think? Shit i'm so mad at him! I don't think I've ever been that mad since I got here. All the shit he thinks he can do with me over the past 2 weeks all just because I have a boyfriend now is just bullshit and he doesn't realize that he destroys our relationship that we built up over the past few months with it. I just want to scream and don't stop screaming. I AM SO PISSED! I can't stand it. I mean what the hell does that have to do with his problems with my hostbrother? Oh man I really feel home, hey Gerrit don't we know that from somewhere....Mom has problems with brother and yells and me? Yeah exactly nothing new, sorry Dad, I am already used to this, nice try. Lived through that for about 12 years...ever since my brother started school. Only this time it's the Dad that yells. And what is this crap about Evan's and Erik's curfew? He doesn't give a shit about when Erik is home and the funny part is that he even told me that today in the car that he doens't care what Erik does. Evan...lol again, he just turned 15 and has the mind of a 13-year-old (no offense Evan ^^). Oh and I didn't do anything wrong? So what's that shit all about then? Why does he make such a fuss about "nothing"??? I wonder why he didn't mention that he has to sleep and that's why I have to be home early. That's what he was trying to make me think in the car. Should I buy it now or not? I don't think I'm gonna believe anything he ever said to me. What's all that crap about "oh yeah I'm so happy for you, Donnie is such a great guy bla bla bla..." WHY THE FUCK DON'T YOU LET ME HANG OUT WITH HIM THEN???? At first he tells me to spend as much time with him as I want to...yay I'm all happy and stuff lalala life is great. Then all the sudden it's like, no Kathrin don't spend to much time with him, and those expectations come up (->Donnie's and Kate's blogs) so I limit my time with Donnie, don't spend as much time with him after school, try to be home for dinner on weekdays, all just to make HIM happy. Oh but wait, actually, if you think about it, I'm still spending too much time with him...so what to do...oh yeah let's just cut the curfew by an hour and make up stuff about my Dad's lack of sleep that is caused by me coming home late. Is that what he's thinking? You know what..I don't give a shit about what he's thinking any more. I don't care. I won't even try to be home for dinner or shit like that jsut to please him. Picking up my room because he might not appprove it this way? No way. Emptying the dish washer? Doing the dishes? Vacuuming? Laundry? Forget about it. Who the hell does he think he is?  Mmmhh...don't wanna go home...don't wanna stay in this house...maybe I'm just gonna run away and live in the woods, eat some bugs and wait there until someone finds me or I die. Don't take that serious. I'm not all about "what's the reason of living" and stuff like that I'm just really down right now. I just don't know what to do. I'm really glad that I'm going camping for 3 days tomorrow. I gotta get out of here for a little bit. I have to think about stuff. I wish I could just do whatever I want. Like get all the people I love from Germany and all the people I love from here to live in one town somewhere by the ocean. With no other people around us who bother us. No parents. No rules. Just me and the people I love. The people that I'll always love.

      mwah...or meh...*lol* Great day at the lake, Donnie & Kate =) Oh man yesterday was awesome. First I went to 2 gradutaion parties, then I went to a Sushi bar which was funny because we had no clue how we were supposed to eat it and what were those weird towels for?? Anyway it was fun and I kept dropping my cucumber roll in the soy sauce and the waiter lokked at us funny but yeah it was great =) ANd then wen went to see Shrek 2 and as we were waiting in line to get our tickets some random guy started talking to Donnie and asking him all those questions like what movie we were gonna see and if we were on a date and blah blah. Really funny though so we decided to be this open to all people too and tried it at the next gas station where DH just talked to some random kids but somehow I don't think they thought it was very funny so they were following us when we left the gas station which was pretty scary lol. Anyway, Shrek 2: Bets movie ever! Almost as good as finding Neme (which a few people still haven't seen yet OMG! ^^) After the movie we met with Drew and then our illegal actions for the night began..lol soaping that guy (I won't say any names...mhhh actually I forgot the name anyhow lol) then trying to get that sign but it just wouldn't work-crap ^^ And then I drove in a car whose owner's name I won't write either lol you guys know it already hehe.  Yeah that was a fun night...except for I think my Mom is mad because I was 15 minutes late again. She asked me to be in by 11 today lol. Guess I'll have to then.  Tomorrow our camping trip is gonna start oh boy so much fun I just hope we can put that huge tent of mine up but hey we have Pepsi with us, the camping-pro lol. Hey Kate isn't that mean that Chelsea wants to get a fake snake and put it under Kati's pillow?? SO mean haha Oh and I forgot to tell you the highlight of the day so far. But maybe I should't since a wrong person could read that. It's got to do with a car that we put some stuff on...but then we realized that that person's sister was driving the car, not the person we actually wanted to prank. Oh well, what are you gonna do, it was fun anyway. Alright gotta go pack now Good luck at soccer tonight, DH =)

      ...or not lol that's just what my coach said every single day but today it's really a glorious day. ~random~ Just got back from Pat's graduation party. Was ok not a whole lot of stuff to do since most the people just came when Kate nad I left. Now I'm waiting for David to give me a ride to Charly's party.  Showed Kate THE list *lol* She laughed pretty hard lol. She thinks I should post it in my blog. Maybe I'm going to. Just to entertain everybody and to show my Germans how weird Americans can be (or only my Dad, idk *lol) So everyone who thinks I should post it, write me a comment =) The only thing is that you just have to laugh about it instead of thinking I would really follow those rules *lol* Breaking every single one, right Donnie? hehe MMhh I'm bored right now. Maybe I should go back to Pat's and get David out of there. Oh wait he's here *yay* See you later guys looking forward to seeing you tongiht

      Just came home from partying with Donnie and Scott. Lol that guy at Taco Bell was so pissed haha that was really funny but hey after all he gave us a free taco and the best thing: He didn't even know he gave us one for free...lol no comprendo "You ordered 4 soft tacos" =) haha that was great. Yeah as you can see I love making fun of dumb people. Hey Donnie and Scott if that guy comes to your work again tomorrow...the one with the bad smell...gimme a call I wanna yell at him in German lol  Today was a nice day. Went shopping with my Kate, almost died eating that yummy candy, watched "The Wedding Planner", made plans for camping (it's gonna be so tight) and then got free ice cream from 2 very nice guys ^^ Then a little bit later we went to Perkins which was a lot of fun because this was the first time the waitress had seen Scott in a certain way (because of security reasons, I'm not gonna name this way lol) Fun fun fun. ANd then when Scott pretended to jack all those things from the table...hahahaa the guy with the mustache was so scary! His look was exactly like this "If you're gonna take this with you boy I'm gonna kill you because I have connections to the French mafia and I'm gonna find you in your house and slice up your stomach, eat your bowels and cook your brain for dinner!" Yeah that was tight =)  Yesterday's party was pimpin' too =) Thank you all those guys who showed up and made it a very special night to me. I hope you had fun. And to those guys who prefered not to show up: YOU SUCK!!! ^^ Man event of yesterday's night: 4 (!!!) cop cars pulling up in front of my house because one of my neighbors thought there was a fight going on. Lol. So funny. Déja-vu. (thanks Donnie for showing me how to make those accents). Fun fun fun. For all of you who don't know yet: My neighbor came over today and apologized. She thought it was a fight because she just heard loud voices and saw a bunch of guys from her window. And her husband wasn't there and her 2 babies woke up. Anyway, she made the event of the night possible so thanks at my neighbor I don't even know the name of. Kinda sad. Oh well what are you gonna do.  A lot of people there yesterday. Made me feel good because it showed me that people care about me. Good feeling I gotta tell you. But there were a lot of questions about Germany. Made me sad. But fortunateley I didn't have a lot of time to be sad. And I don't really want to think about it right now either because my night was too much fun to worry about things that just give me a headache and I can't change it anyhow.   Mmmhh let's see what else was there in the past few days? Oh man Senior all night party was AWESOME! The night of my life. Seriously. Got to graduate with all those great people that I got to know...got to ride in a limo to the Rec Center...got to walk over a red carpet with tons of people at the sides taking pictures...got a ton of stuff for free...holy cow it was just great. Can't describe it. You guys check it out next year. I just can't think of words to describe what an awesome feeling that was...the whole night starting with putting on my cap and gown. Yeah I'm not gonna try to describe it further but you guys will see what it's like in only 12 months.    Yay Seniors 2005! I love you!     I'm gonna head to bed now. Yay I get to sleep in tomorrow. No stupid workers next door. I hope you guys do well on your ACTs.   Oh and this is for my best friend back in good old Germany,  Gerrit , because I know you will read this but you won't post a comment because you think it's weird: Post a comment! Schreib einen Kommentar! Those guys here speak German also schreib auf Deutsch! =) *motivation* hey that's spelled the same way in English and in German! Amazing ^^  Ok and this is to all of you guys...I just wanna thank you for being who you are. I want you to know that every single one of you is a great person and all of you have a very special place in my heart. And since I can't change my heart I will never ever change the people who are in it. Just wanted you to know this.   Good night guys

      I just came back from this rehearsal that we thought would take about 4 hours 'til 7.30 when I graduate...lol. It wasn't even an hour long and we just "practiced" walking and the order and all that crap. Very efficient use of time lol Yeah now I'm home and bored...SO glad the weather finally turned out good so it won't be in the gym.   Do you realize that school is done for this year? And that American High School is done for me forever? It's such a weird feeling. On the one hand I'm glad that I have more time to spend with you guys now but on the other hand...I really loved this school. And I still do. It was awesome. And another thing is that the end of school means that D-Day isn't far away any more now...but ok guess I talked about that enought yesterday. Thanks you for your comment Donnie...that really helped me and cheered me up. I was just sad that I have to leave. Guess that feeling won't go away that quickly either. But thanks, really, that comment was just what I needed yesterday. Yay the sun is shining! Oh man I'm getting pretty excited for tonight! It's gonna be fun I think. Erik just told me about his graduation last year and how they all just randomly started blowing up balloons during the ceremony. I think I should do that ^^ Ok guys I'll see you there tonight and don't forget to cheer for me =) Love ya all!

      Isn't it ironic that I want to be a big part of someone's life but at the same time I don't? I mean, it's a great feeling to know that there is somebody out there that I mean a lot to. It's just good to know that I am a part in someone's life and that there actually are people who love me the way I am. I am a big part of someone's life. Aweseome feeling. But at the same time...not good. All just because of me. Because I have to leave. Too soon. I don't want to. I hope you all know that. I just want to stay here forever with the people I love and the people who love me. Just like that. But hey who said life would be that easy? No that would just be too perfect and too easy for me to stay here forever and never go back. And that's where I don't want to be such a big part in people's lives. I'm gonna hurt them. Just like it's gonna hurt mee too. Except for it's gonna hurt them more. Why? I don't know. But I don't want to hurt the people I love. I don't want them to be sad for the rest of thir live all because of me. I never thought that I could do that....that I could actually be able to make people love me so much that I'm messing up their lives because I have to leave. I'm really sorry guys. But I can't do anything about it. I just can't. Sorry.

      Ok Kate I really should've listened to you and went to the library with you because there is no way I can study in this house. It's not just that my brother thinks it's necessary to turn up his music even thouh I already went up there twice and told him to turn this crap down...nope now the phone doesn't stop ringing. Let me check...yepp definetely 12 phone calls in the past 10 minutes. And there comes another one. I can't stand it right now. And it's too hot to study too. Damn those freaking finals. Ok now my Dad is home and pretty soon he's gonna come in my room and wants to know how my day was. And thenm I'm gonna be all beasty because everything is annoying me right now....argh! I wish I had a car right now. Or maybe I wanna be a bird. Like in Forrest Gump. When Jenny wanted to be a bird. Lol that was random. Anyway sometimes I really wish I was a bird. Damn it this is not a very good day. Yepp and there my Dad comes and tells me to com eat. Aaaaaahhh I don't want food right now. God why is it so hard to study. Tomorrow I'm gonna laugh about this post. I swear.  Anyway just needed a break from this chaos for a little bit. That helped. Now I have to go eat. Don't you hate when people make you eat when you don't want to? Well I do. I'll probably delete this post tomorrow because I'm gonna be embarassed. Haha. Have fun studiyng everyone lol

      Isn't it awkward that sometimes mosquitos don't bte you but only the person who is with you? And then all the sudden they attack you as well. Weird. Ok that was random but I have to say, I hate when that happens ^^  Yeah today...good day, good day. Not comparable at all with yesterday. Except for I forgot to call Kate...sorry Suesse I just remembered that. But now it's too late. Sorry. Ok what else is there to write about...weather was great haha but even if it stays that great I'm gonna have to study for the finals instead of hangin out at the lakes or something fun. Argh. Anyway...anything else I could write about?? Oh yeah sooo much stuff but I always have to consider that there will be a lot of people who are gonna read this so maybe I'm not gonna write about everything that is in my head right now...people who want to know can come and ask me about it =) Alright I'm gonna go and have a less confusing dream (hopefully) now....have a good night everyone N8 (hah figure out what that means *lol*)

      Don't you hate that when you wake up and you are even more confused than when you went to bed? Don't you hate when you dream all kinds of crap about people you like? OMG I hate that so much!  Dreaming about people that you care about turning into persons you hate the most sucks. Lol I think I shouldn't take my dreams that serious...maybe I'm just a very confused person =) Anyway, happy new day, guys ^^

      Ok this was definetely a very interesting night...I mean, first feeling bad about all kinds of stuff I was doing...then a tight crash...and now everything is just a blurr. I mean, what happened today. Now I am at home and almost half asleep although I've just been up for like 13 hours. Weird. Just as weird as all the other stuff that happened today. I think everyone was confused today. Why? Not a clue. It just seemed like it. Started out at Ridgedale and didn't stop until I got home about an hour ago. There were the people at parties...ice cream all over my shirt...other people who mean a lot to me...bowling *lol*...cars...but guess what now this day is almost over...to be exact in 7 seconds......NOW! Yay new day new luck (old German thing to say haha). Hope this one is not gonna be as strange as yesterday. Except for I already have no clue what's gonna be going on. So many people I should hang out with. Hah like I'm that popular *lol* Anyway I'm gonna go dream a little now...because dreaming is awesome. Makes you feel closer to persons you want to be close to.  Thanks at Kate for making me create this blog it's good to write stuff down.  N8 =)

      Ok as I was waiting with Kate at Ridgedale today to get some free ice cream (thx DH) she told me to create a blog so I did. And know what, that's really an awesome idea 'cuz then you people will always know what I'm doing...even if I'm not here any more. But since I try not to think about this I'm not gonna get into that now. It's gonna give me a headache if I do. So yeah guess I'm supposed to write about my day...let's see...went to 2 Grad Parties was pretty awesome I've been eating free food all day long ^^ No I'm just waiting for phone calls to see what's going on tonight. So nothing too exciting today. Haha how come people don't know my real age? 2 People today who were freaking out because they didn't know. So funny. Just because I'm a senior?? A REAL senior?? Doesn't mean I'm 18 =) I'm just enjoying my privileges of being German.  Ok I really don't know what to write now so I'm just gonna stop before I start rambling on about stuff...

      Kate, this is just for you. Because I love you! I miss you so much! I hope you know that you are truly the best. Don't let anyone tell you something else. I wish I could be there in SLP with you right now, stand by your side, and help you fight the evil people. The bitches and sons of muggles that think they're something better than you and can give you so much crap. Man I really wish I could be there with you. Listen to you and try to help you. But those people just don't deserve to be your friends. Don't let people like that pull you down so much. You really don't need that shit. You are strong and have to take all this and the people don't even realize how much they hurt you. That makes me so mad! I don't want my little Kate to get hurt by anyone and I just wanna come over there and yell at people and tell them how stupid they are to do things that risk something great. One of the best things that ever happened to me. Your friendship! It just makes me furious to see all the shit that's been going on over there in the past few weeks and how you have to just take it because there isn't that much you can do to make things better. And I'm sitting here in Germany, 4000 miles away, reading how you're getting hurt over and over again and I can't do anything to prevent that! I'm really sorry for that! I just want to go buy a ticket and come over. C'est la vie I guess lol. So ist das Leben.  Kate, you are great. That's why your nickname is Kate the Great. I hope you know that you really are great. The greatest girl in this whole wide world. And I've seen quite a bit of it already. But you are still the greatest. Don't let anyone make you think you aren't. I love you for what you are and I hope other people can't change you just because they've changes tremendously. Soon you're gonna come to Germany and we're gonna party big time and show all those losers that there's nobody as great as you in this world. Remember...the German girl 4000 miles away from you is sitting in her basement and thinking about you all the time and she misses you a ton and loves you even more! Love you! Mwah! xoxoxo

      I found out that I really don't like German people any more. Well, some of them. Some of their opinions. Some of their behavior. Germans are weird. Oh shit, I forgot, I'm one of them. Damn it. Lol I hate that German people only think about what's best for themselves. Example: Shopping. I hate shopping here. People go wherever they want, however it pleases them, not looking at other people, just not caring about where other people are standing or walking. Why should they? I mean, they are the importan ones out there, who cares about other people? Let's just run over them. Apologize? What's that?? Never even heard of the word "sorry". "Entschuldigung". Meh. I hate when people are so damn selfish.  I hate that German people don't even say hi to each other. Example: In the forest. Going for a walk with my doggy. I met 2 people. Said "Guten Tag" to both of them. One of them didn't even respond at all. So I'm like..meh, whatever. The other one looked at me like I was from Mars and was just like "Tag" but it was so quiet that I only knew she said it because her lips moved. So from now on...no more "GUten Tag" to strangers I guess. Lol how ridiculous is that? But ok I can live with that.  I hate that German people look at me weird when I want to go for a walk with&nbsp;my dog in sweat pants. What the hell??? Am I supposed to walk through the woods with my Prom dress or what? Damn it, what's the big deal about that "That's the American style she has now" was my Mom's comment. Man, what the hell is wrong with sweat pants? In the forest? SO annoying. Flip Flops? NOT socially acceptable according to my family. Duh, I LOVE flip flops. Damn that German weirdo style. How come German people are just so locked up against new things? Hate that. Cracking my back. Brother's comment"Oh man, just because you lived in America for a year doesn't mean you have to crack your back now!" BUT I FEEL LIKE CRACKING MY BACK! I feel like wearing flip flops. I feel like NOT dressing up to go through the forest. I feel like being nice to other people. But people don't care about what I feel like doing. Man, I hate that. SO much.  The word of the day lol. It's not as bad as it sounds. I still love Germany. =) Have a nice weekend everyone and don't party too hard lol

      Do you think I should take it personally that it hasn't stopped raining ever since I got here on Thursday morning?? Damn, I hate this weather. Makes me depressed. Time to go to Greece with my parents for 10 days..oh wait no, I have to wait until 1 day before my birthday. THEN we leave. Lol. But it's gonna be fun anyway. Finally I'm gonna know what summer is like. Oh well I already had some summer in Minnesota. So that's ok. People tell me I'm tan haha since they haven's seen the sun for a long time =) Well, it's 3.45 pm here now. You guys are probably still asleep. I slept until 11 this morning, got up, took a shower, went grocery shopping, cooked lunch, and now I'm at the computer. Since about an hour. Wrote some mails, got some stuff done.  The rest of the day is probably gonna be boring. Maybe I'm gonna make it a TV day like Kate did the other day =) Speaking of Kate, here you are, I blogged =) Now you just have to get DH to blog =) I wonder what you guys are up to. Probably the same old question "What should we do now?" But nobody knows the answer. Know what we forgot to do? We forgot to stock Herr Holmbeck. I just remembered that. But now you guys don't know where he lives. That sucks. So I'm gonna have to come back soon and show you =) Haha I'm in my brother's room right now and guess what I found on his desk....TWIZZLERS! Real American Twizzlers! I'm gonna have to steal them and eat them in my basement room when nobody is home. I had your Luna Bar for breakfast yesterday, Kate! And my friends ate all the Clownfish. I'm hiding the Starbursts.   I've been trying to keep myself busy so I don't get sad while thinking about how much I miss you guys. I've been successful =) Yesterday I hung out with Gerrit and the day before I slept until 3 and then had some friends over. Only today sucks. Can't really motivate myself to call someone. Maybe I'm gonna go over to my neighbor's and ask him when I can start working for him. Meh, tomorrow maybe =) I miss saying meh and yay. For some odd reason the weird Germans don't know those cool words. And I had to explain why my nickname K dog is too. Man, so much work =) Ok I'm gonna go watch some TV now. Have a nice day you guys!

      I'm sad because I miss St. Louis Park. I miss my friends...I miss how we never know what to do...I miss the Minnesotan weather...I miss my hostfamily...but most of all I MISS MY FRIENDS!!! Oh man I think I'm going crazy. I just went for a walk with my dog and I talked to my dog in English lol what the hell is happening?? I'm such a dork. But know what, my dog understood it because I told her to sit and she did it *yay* American dog.  And I really don't like German people any more. I met 2 people in the forest and to both of them I said "Guten Tag" since I'm a nice American girl but one of them didn't response at all and the other one mumbled a "hallo" that I just could tell it was a hallo because of the lip movement. I hate German people. I want to be in America again. With you. My friends. Maybe we can ship some of my friends over too...lol and my family and my dog haha  Ok enough talking about how much I miss you I guess you know that anyways. Today I slept until 3pm. It was great. Now I'm trying to get a hold of some of my friends but somehow no one is home.  Ok I'm gonna go now, hope you guys have a great day...love ya!

      Wow I can't believe that it's just been 3 days since I saw you guys...since I walked through the security at the airport, heard you guys yell "We love you Kathrin" which made me smile although I was more sad than I've ever been my entire life. Since I walked out of your sight, sat down in the airplane and couldn't stop crying for 50 minutes, until I was in Chicago. God I always knew that it was gonna be tough but you guys know that I'm not a person who likes to cry in front of people but I couldn't help it. All the way to Chicago. The people next to me probably thought I was insane lol.   Well, now I'm here. Way too far away from you guys. I'm trying to keep myself busy so I don't have to think about you all the time. Did some stuff with my friends, and Gerrit organized a surprise party for me at his house, that was really sweet.   I'm finally all unpacked now too. Put up all the pictures in my room. Was kinda sad. I just miss you guys so much. But then I thought "Hey, just remember all the memories we have...that's nothing to cry about, it's just awesome." So I was ok. But that doesn't change the fact that I miss you. Seems like an eternity since we last saw each other. Weird.   Tomorrow I'm gonna meet more of my friends and on Monday I'm gonna go to my school and make fun of them because they have to go to school. Yeah that's what I do here lol. Kinda nice seeing all my friends again. But it's still bittersweet. Hey know what, they're gonna build a Subway in the town right next to me. Saw the sign today. Subway-eat fresh. Lol that made me happy, a little piece of America right by me haha.  I don't really know what to write about my days in Germany. It's not all that exciting somehow. I just want to thank all of you guys. Thank you for making this year as awesome as it was for me. I love you so much! Thank you for being there for me, for being my friends, for meeting me, for accepting me the way I am, just for being my great friends over the entire year! All of you made this year so special to me. The best year of my life. Forever. And all just because of you.   I LOVE YOU GUYS!!

      I hate that I have to go to the cabin for almost 5 entire days. I hate that they make me do that although they know that I'd rather spend at least 2 of the 3 days with my friends. I hate that they won't let me go back with Ryan on Monday night. I hate that they make me do that.  I'm getting scared right now. So scared. In one week from today I'll be sitting in Germany wondering how my friends in America are doing. In one week from today I'll have said Goodbye to the people I love not knowing when I'll see them again. In a week from today I won't be sitting in front of this crappy computer and typing. In one week from today I won't live in St. Louis Park any more. In one week from today I won't be able to hang out with you guys any more. In one week from today everything will be so different. Too different from me. It's so weird. I saw it coming, of course, I always knew that one day I'm gonna have to go back and leave the people that mean so much to me behind in a country I can only come to to visit. But yet it always seemed so far away...this day when I have to say Goodbye. D-Day. The worst day of my life. The day when everyting changes. But now all of the sudden...it's almost there and it wasn't until a few days ago that I actually realized it.  I hate being at home right now. Everything reminds me of the 7th. My Mom keeps telling me all the things I have to do before I leave. She already brought both my suitcases upstairs and put them into my room. She confirmed my ticket. She is planning on what color my room is gonna be when Evan lives in here. She is planning on what to do on the 8th. She keeps telling me that I have to start packing. She can't talk about anything else but me leaving. Makes me crazy.  Fortunately I'm gonna get out of here pretty soon. I'm gonna rollerblade arounf the lakes with BZ. It's really hot out though. Hope I don't die lol. Oh and another thing guys, DON'T worry about me, ok? I mean, all the stuff I write in here is just what's in my head right now. I'm fine otherwise. Really. You know me, I always think too much. So please, don't let that pull you down, because the last thing I want is you to worry about me worrying too much. It'd just how I am. I'm fine, really.

      Greece...I wasn't sure at first if I really wanted to go there for 10 entire days with only my parents but I'll tell ya what , I'm looking forward to it SO much!! I need vacation so badly...need it to have time to think about certain things...things that have been bothering me more and more...my feelings are all mixed up. What to do? I don't know. And nobody can help me on that one. I have to make certain decisions in my life by myself but you guys know how much I even hate the smallest decisions, so I don't even wanna start talking about how much I hate this one I'm gonna have to make some time really soon. Before Greece? After Greece...? I don't know. I have to make up my mind. That is, I actually already kind of did. But well. This is bs. Everything seems so ridiculous. I can't manage this situation any more. I just can't stand it. But how can I make this end? Shit.   By the way, thanks for all your comments on my last blog. It helped me a lot. And anonymous, I doN't know you but ya it's good to know that even people who don't really know me that well don't think I'm a bitch. Thanks.

      Friends….how do I know who my friends are?? How do you define the word “friend”?? Are those people my friends that I’ve been knowing for a damn long time....or people I just got to know a couple of weeks ago?? People that tell me what they think...people that are just like the nicest people and wouldn’t ever say something that hurts me?? People who make fun of me when I do stuff that’s wrong so I realize when it’s wrong what I’m doing...or people who just tell me what I want to hear?? People that don’t stop making fun of me even if they notice that it really bothers me that they’re doing that...or people that wouldn’t ever make fun of me (at least not in front of me)?? People who can make up their minds about stuff really fast, sometimes too fast...or people who listen to what I have to say about things first before they make up their mind about it?? People who can say really really hurtful things to me....or people who wouldn’t ever hurt me?? People who don’t even realize that I’m hurt by what they say...or people that realize things like that right away?? People who call me a bitch and think I’m cool with that....or people who would wanna beat people up that call me a bitch??  WHO THE HELL ARE MY REAL FRIENDS???? Why the fuck do they think I don’t mind them calling me a bitch...my FRIENDS calling me a bitch??? Why the hell do they think I won’t think about it if they do that??? Now, do they really think I’m a bitch just because I know a lot of guys and I like a lot of guys because they are my FRIENDS (at least that’s what I thought) ???? Or do they really get the impression that I’m flirting with them just because I’d sit there and talk to them for a while when nobody else is around just to find out what’s going on with them?? Are they really thinking I’m like that?? Or is it just one of their “let’s-make-fun-of-kathrin-things”??? Well I always knew that they are mean and rude to other people but were they always rude and disrespectful to me as well??? Or do they just hink “Uh, that girl just came back from America, and she has a boyfriend living there, how stupid is that, let’s make fun of her because we didn’t get a chance to the last 11 months”?????  I don’t know what to think...I just know that I can hardly stand it any more. I wanna go back to the Park where I know who my friends are...where people know who I am...yeah, I changed, duh, of course I did. I’m more confident in myself, yes, and I have more boy than girlfriends. Woohoo big deal. That just doesn’t mean I’m a bitch. Or does it? Am I really a bitch? See, I don’t even know. Maybe that’s what a bitch is. Sitting there and talking to her friends who just happen to be guys. Making new friends, meeting new people on parties. Maybe I should just stay down here in my basement and try to figure out what the word “friend” means and then, when i got it figured out, in about 25 years, I’m gonna go outside and make new friends. Leave the past behind, break up with all my friendships and meet new people.  Or I just come back to the Park =)
