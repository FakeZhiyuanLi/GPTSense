          Where to start...lets see, i have alot of freedom this is true, im practically allowed to do anything i want, because i hate my mom so much she feels the need to kiss my ass, i always prayed that she would just be gone, leave some how. guess what!! my prayers were answered...my mom is temporarilly being held up, like a prisoner hahaha. omg...i should not be laughing, but what else is there to do when u have cried so much, that theres nothing else to cry? u laugh....thats not coming easy either. guess who has fulfilled my mothers role....ME! so that "freedom" i had, is gone. i can have people over, but as of now, theres no point to anything.

      Ok after school I saw Lauren and we talked (not long) and i wanted to talk to her longer but she was leaving...i met up wit De De and asked her to talk to her fo me bcuz they real tite. i guess...hopefully all goes well...the reason why i want to talk to her is bcuz summer is up and i want to have someone and not worry about next year and go thru all the mess i went thru this year...like da baw tones ^_^ iight pce!!!

      Hey tuesday...i chilled (last day of punishment) and had detention. It fuckin sucked...god it was boring...I upgraded my computer to Windows XP Pro. So sexy...uhh and now I am in school and its Wednesday and I am a free man. It's time to party it up ^_^. Talked to Lauren yesterday...she grounded. I am going to give up talking to her because she goes to centrevill too much and she prolly gots someone down thurr so imma just keep it pimpin. (I decided this last nite). I missed the bus this morning and im so fuckin hungry but that spanish bitch in the lunch line keeps fuckin up my money and I am super pissed. O well...pce!!!
