      Ok heres the deal, im an agry young man, I'v got alot going on in my life at the moment. But every single teenager in the world does, so I cant complain about this, coz my situation isn't bad.  GIRL troubles- Every 17 year old guy knows what I'm talking about! You chicks are crazy! Feelings changing more often than a baby's nappy... I still love you, but not as a GF! Hoping that you realise how much you mean to me as a friends some day soon, then maybe we can spend time together.  FRIEND troubles- Now this is messed up! Wouldnt you think that the boys you hang out with for 3 years are ya best mates! Well obviously not, as I'v found out recently! Teenage guys can be worse than chicks, they love backstabbing each other, the problem is when you start to do it to you're own group of friends.  DEATH issues- I really dont wanna accept this whole death thing, everybody dies... but this is my greatest fear in life! Losing the people that i care for the most, its like all of you'r love has gone to waste or somthing... Once i can accept this I will be there for my friend who needs me.  SCHOOL problems- School has to be the most boring place on earth! Everyday i go there do my lessons, then at recess and lunch times i just walk around from group to group talkin to random people, some ppl who i really like i avoid, I cant hack that either.  MAKING the RIGHT decision- Thers another problem i'm gonna be facing soon, thats what to do when i leave school, which i really wanna drop out of! I need to decide where i want my life to go, I love art... But im lazy, to be successful in the art world it takes motivation.  {A CONFLICT INSIDE ME} Thers all of these emotions inside me at the moment, anger, love, hate, lust ect... Its pretty hard for me to act happy while i dont know how i'm feeling, its so strange... theres only one person that makes me truely happy, but there alot of great friends that can cheer me up... I guess I'v been down these holidays because I dont have a GF and my mates seem to be busy every day.  BORED AS A MF!!! Need a CHANGE of scenery. well not as a mf, coz at least then i'd be doin somthing lol... All this time alone, makes me think about times that were better, places i wish i could go back to, ppl i wish i could be with again, i wanna go back to europe live there for like a couple of years. Anyone wanna come with me??? It'l be mad fun.

      In a world so full of hate and violence, our youth is subject to media propaganda... We as a society are teaching young people to hate for no reason, this has to stop! If the media didnt expose us to so much descrimination, war, hate and death we might be able to see the effects of it.

      Well as of yesterday i decided to forget all my troubles and move on with my life... easier said than done! Yesterday was the most exhausting day of my life, i went to the city with cam and bartles... was there a shop in the city that we didnt look at? NO!!! When we finally left cam was trying to convince the two of us to come to some Hunters dance party? bartles was smart and quickly went home, but being the sucker that i am i went back to cam's house. there duane soon showed up and they convinced me that it would be worth coming to, lies! We picked up some drinks and left for sutherland. When we got there to buy tickets some stoners where talking to duane so we couldnt get tickets! Woohoo, well thats what i thought till cam went back and got some... at this stage it was about 7pm, the stupid party didnt start till 7.30 and we had a bag full of alcohole, so we had to drink it down fast!  We stumbled into this over crowded hall thingy full of like year 9 and 10 kids! Im like, you guys came here to pick up??? desperate kids!!! as it turned out most of the night i spent sitting at the bar, while those two tried to get close to little girls, HAHAHA. I guess im the only one of us who didnt go to pick up... just not ready and it seems a lil sleezy, rather get to know chicks first... but thats just me lol.  By 10.30 i was wishing for a quick and painless death!!! it was so hot in there, and all these shire kids were prancing around :s... NOT MY SCENE, at 11.30 we made a group decision to get the hell outta there, the two boys didnt get close to picking up and i needed some tucker!   Caught the train to oatley and walked down to the bp in mortdale, where those two clowns were joking about being starving! when i was, so i boaght a whole bbq chicken at 12am and ate half on the way back to cam's house...  *reminder to self... never buy chicken from bp! then i msg'd about 5 ppl when i was at cams house lol, yeh ppl are gonna reply at 12.30??? well actually a few did, so i was like... woohoo!!!  Now im pretty down, coz i spent all my money yesterday on stupid shit! like a $10 chicken which i ended up throwing at a car and drinks which i didnt drink!!! Meant to go back to the city on thursday and drinking thursday night at olds or sumthin... sounds pretty stupid, but if people come it will be ok, then meant to be goin footy fri night... but this isnt gonna happen without funding!   Now im gonna go get some excercise to work off that chicken from last night lol, hope this has been an interesting experience for you all... reading the boring truth about my life...
