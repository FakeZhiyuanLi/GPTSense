      &nbsp; So here I am sitting at home on a day im supposed to be at work, nursing a migraine with a galon of water and a semi dark room, wondering why people are such nitwits at times.&nbsp; I woke up today and when i opened my eyes it felt like my brain was coming out every hole in my head all at once.&nbsp; So, me being broke again i didn't have money for any headache medicine, and not being able to get out of bed i called in sick to work.&nbsp; The manager who i talked to was like "so let me get this straight, your not coming in because your head hurts a little, right?" I felt like saying to her 'no you stupid moron, im calling in sick cuz i have trouble standing because of my migraine' but i didnt, i just said yes, to which she just said "ah,ok. I'll mark that down." Sooo needless to say i will have "a talk" waiting for me when i get to work tomorrow.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Just to give you an idea of the type of person she is I'm going to explain another encounter i have had with her.&nbsp; There was a night when we were closing up the store and she told me to recover a sectiopn of books (recover being the term used to mean tidy up).&nbsp; So i go over there and its not too terribly bad. I tidy it up and I'm off to do more disastrous sections of the store.&nbsp; Five minutes later she walks up to me and tells me it still looks terrible and i need to go over there and fix it.&nbsp; So me being in a retail store i figured that 'ok maybe someone messed it up' and i head back to take a look.&nbsp; It's fine.&nbsp; Nothing wrong, everything in its place.&nbsp; So i figure ok she probably didnt look at it.&nbsp; Another 5 minutes later she walks up to me and goes "look i asked tou to fixed the section. come with me and ill show you what i mean."&nbsp; Now to give you an idea at the time i had worked there for over 4 years and i knew how to do my job.&nbsp; She walks over there&nbsp; and finds a little 2inch by 3 inch book that had fallen over on the shelf because there wasnt anything on the other side of it to hold it up, and leans back up against the other books.&nbsp; At which point i tell her "look, the section is fine, whatever it is you see out of place is in your head."  Now i half expected to have gotten in trouble, but i didnt, she just gave her blond nitwit laugh and walked off.&nbsp; And that went on a couple more times that night.&nbsp; She also accused another coworker of yelling at her, which was a lie too, i gave witness to that.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; See? this is the quality of people i get to work with.&nbsp; If anyone else out there has management like this i am truely sorry for you.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyways, my parents are on their way over to loan me 20 dollars so i can get some advil, so hopefully i can get better soon.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Thats it for now. Till next time.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        Hey there folks!  A friend of mine did one of these and told me bout it,so i checked his out.  I thought is was kinda cool so i figured i would try one also.  I dont know if my thoughts and comments will be all that great or informative, however i hope they will be amusing enough to read.    Now, where to start?  Ah, yes!  My job.  I work in a book store here in Oregon, and its a decent job no matter what my co-workers may say (and believe me i have had some pretty lousy jobs).  My job in the store is to unpack and stock the books we get in that are predetermined as bargain books.  Seeing as how I have been working there at around ......wow 5 years already?.....i have seen many people come and go, along with different managment "afflictions".  Now anyone who works for any comoany knows that given time there will eventually be some kind of shift in who does what when.  It is inevitable. Dont fight it, just let it go. And yet, no matter how it changed, my little corner has remained relatively untouched. I dont know who i have to thank for that one, but it has made my life a teensy bit easier.    Anyways! Enough about work!      Yesturday i sent off my application for financial aid! i am soooo excited, i am soo looking forward to going back to school.  I have kinda been planning on it for a couple years already but somehow i always kept putting it off, I'm not sure what it was that kicked me in the ass and made me do it.  Perhaps it was the influence of one of my friends that did it, whatever it was i needed it.  School never sounded fun to me as a kid, i always dreaded going.  Kids always picked on me, and i rarely liked the teachers.  But now, i am excited about it.  The idea that this time its my choice to do it instead of some forced thing makes it so much more appealing to me now.    Well that's it for now.  I think later I'll post some of my own short stories or a chapter or two of one of my longer ones, maybe a post about something funny and stuff like that.  For now ill just think about it and post more later.    In the mean time, toodles!
