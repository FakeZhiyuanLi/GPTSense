      I have been thinking of creating this Celtic Blog for a long time.  Finally I have taken the plunge!  Hopefully by the time the new season starts I will be up to speed on Blogs

      As yet, there is no word on any new Signings.  Plenty of Newspaper speculation and guessing but nothing concrete.  I hope we make 2 or 3 significant Signings. What we need are players who will be First Team regulars, not just additions to the Squad.  We have enough of them already.  There are some who do not seem to have the character to force the Management Team to consider them as regular picks.  Under O’Neill the favoured 11 has been consistent and this, I believe, has been a fundamental reason for our success in the last 4 years.  Some Signings have suggested much promise but subsequently failed to deliver – so far.  Some might walk into a few home truths when they meet up with the Management Team this pre-season.  I want every player in the Hoops to prove his worth and improve as his Celtic career progresses.  I take no pleasure in any Signing not working out.  Of course, everyone is concerning himself or herself with who will replace the Magnificent 7.  The answer is no one will.  Henrik and Celtic were a unique combination of circumstances that happen to Celtic every so often, and will again.  What needs to be replaced are his goals, team ethic and contribution to our success.  1 man may not be the answer.  It will probably require 2, who get into the team, game in, game out, and make an impact.  Over the last 4 years I believe Martin O’Neill, his Management Team and the players who have delivered big for us, have earned the Right to have some fresh faces willing to take their share of the load.

      The SPL Decision makers got it wrong when they told Sky where to go a few years back.  They got a very good offer yet knocked it back because the SPL Chairmen thought they knew the market better than Sky TV.  Sky set new standards in covering football, standards that BBC & ITV appear not to have even tried to match.  If you have any doubt about that compare the coverage of the Champions League this season.  What Sky offered was the way it should be.  So now we have moved on to Setanta and, as I write, I am still undecided whether go subscribe or not.  They are promising a better package then they have delivered in previous seasons.  Hopefully they will be true to their word.  The TV Deal in Scotland is allowing the Old Firm fans to see their team playing away from home in the comfort of their living room, or if we have any sense the Pub.  Right away Setanta have moved Celtic's Flag unfurling to Sunday.  I hate Sunday games at home and this one, more than most should have been Saturday at 3pm.  So Setanta will have to wait for me to make my mind up...
