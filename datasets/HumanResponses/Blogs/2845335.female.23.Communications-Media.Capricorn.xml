      I hate hugs.  I have this running joke with Baron and Andrea that they shouldn't hug me no matter how forlorn I look because if they hug me it will only make matters worse. When Baron tires to hug me I cringe.  This makes me think of this one police detective whom I had a strong connection to.  I would see him when I went to check the logs and we would talk story and I could tell he liked me because he was always throwng sincere compliments my way, about how smart I was and more importantly how I seemed to have empathy and understanding.  One evening he called me out of the blue and asked if I'd go on a walk with him.  How weird, I thought. If he's a detective he must be old already. Like at least 30. (Turns out he was 32).  But he was local so he looked young.  Anyway, I went ahead and met him and off we walked. He was nice, and mostly talked about police things, so that I would understand things from a police officer's point of view and not just any police officer but a police officer that genuinely cared about his job.  All of this was sincere on his part I felt. I thought he was a little naive. But it disarming to have someone that wholeheartedly naive about something he really cares about.  I found out he has a girlfriend and two kids. He told me when his daughter was a baby she would let him carry her anywhere. If he put her down she cried. They were so close. He said it got so that he could hold her in one arm while he was doing the dishes. Sometimes her foot would dip into the suds-filled sink.  His son, the younger one, wasn't like that at all. But now he's five and some kind of genius. The detective told me he and his girlfriend got his latest test scores and were blown away by the brilliance. He said he looked at the test score, then at his son, and felt awed. His son likes to draw. He can look at something and then just sketch it out.  The detective also told me he and his girlfriend don't really get along. They concentrate all their energy on their children.  Some people would say he was just hitting on me.  I guess, in a way, he was.  But he wasn't. He hinted that he would like to go out with me if he didn't already have the girlfriend and the kids. He liked me but he wasn't going to do anything about it.  I suppose I felt the same way.  Whenever I think of him now, though, I imagine his baby daughter's feet in the soap suds.

      The new people have begun arriving. Joe the new sports editor, seems like a nice guy, good sense of humor, still relatively quiet. He's a friend of Brian, our old sports guy who's been promoted.   And Carly, the new page designer. Petite girl with long brown hair and blue eyes. She's from North Carolina and has a military boyfriend who's in Iraq. She smokes a lot but seems like a smart girl, nice.  Abby, the new editor of our weekly and Carolyn the other reporter are due to arrive within the next week.  And here I confess.  I feel so threatened by these new people, that they will render me obsolete.  Carly is only 22 as is Carolyn.  To be totally honest I am also afraid, I can't explain why, that Carolyn will be prettier than me that her beauty will make me invisible.   This is stupid, girly insecurity.

      Have you ever been so overwhelmed by the things you have to do that your mind shuts down and you end up forgetting? This happens to me all the time. I wonder if some fancy-schmancy drug company has already come up with a name for it. Like Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I refuse to pop a pill for my freak-outs.  I don't understand how you can enjoy being high strung, my friends tell me.  But I do kind of. It's weird. I see high-strung people and they can be so annoying. And yet I continue to hold on to the (perhaps misguided) belief that I am charming in my panic.

      Walking to the check-out counter at the local Wal-Mart when a local guy walks by yelling over his shoulder at a friend,  "Let me know if you know somebody that like my truck! The safety check stay good for another 10 months!"  "OK. Shoots."

      Today it rained. It rained like I remembered it raining in Hilo. It rained so that I wished I was at home, under a blanket, asleep with a book on my chest.

      Me: Hi. I'm a reporter calling from.... I'm just reading your press release about the student that brought the Napalm to school. It says "initial investigations showed there were no injuries." Was anyone injured?  Desk Sgt: Uhhhh.....I don't.....Hold on.  (Muffled mumbling)  Desk Sgt: Nope. As far as we know no one was injured.  Me: It says one of the students brought the Napalm and another ignited it. Which one was arrested?  Desk Sgt: Uhhhhh....hold on.  (More mumbling)  Desk Sgt: I'm not sure.  Me: Well, did anyone have to be evacuated?  Desk Sgt: Hold on.  (Mumble, mumble, mumble)  Desk Sgt: Nah. No one had to be evacuated.  Me: OK. Thanks.  Then I called the Fire Department and they filled me in. Some kid brought a styrophone cup full of Napalm and his friend set it on fire. It was a really small fire and fire fighters disposed of the cup and Napalm.  "These kids now days!" the fire fighter I spoke to said in exasperation.  "I was about to say that," I replied. "Then I realized how old that would make me sound."  Fire fighter laughs. "Yeah, me too. Ha ha ha. So we don't need to print that part."

      Me: Brian, I am such a failure. I couldn't even get in touch with the mother. I'm an awful investigative reporter.  Brian: There you go reading my mind again. You better knock that off.  Me: Mind reading! Well I knew I was good for  something . You always cheer me up.  Brian: Well, that's my job.  ****  Travis: You are the new hardest working person in the office.  Me: Huh?  Travis: You're a work horse. You're a machine.  Me: What makes you say that?  Travis: Look at you. You're still here working. You're a machine.  Me: Well, I'm fueled by my insecurities.

      I spent today following up on a father and son who'd been hit by a drunk driver on Sunday. I tried various means to get in touch with the boy's mother to get the human interest side of the story.  She never contacted me and at one point I learned she may have made a deal to tell her story to another news organization. I almost cried, I was so frustrated when I heard this. I could see the story slipping away.  Now that I've calmed down, I wonder if it was worth being so worked up over. Is the story really more important than concern for the father and son's well being? Is it really more important than the distress the family is going through?  I tried to convince myself that the reason I wanted to interview the mother was because having her story in the newspaper would help her. It would drum up community sympathy and support. Good things would come of it. And undoubtably this is true.  But my main concern was the story. Just getting the story. And this makes me feel like some kind of mercenary.  Perhaps I am thinking about this too much.  I have to believe my sources can see through me. They'll know whether I am really concerned or simply out to exploit them.

      Lt. B. and I agreed that Sgt. M is a smart man. He has a a wry sense of humor, rich with wit--the kind of humor that only comes with having brains.  "He has a master's degree too, you know," Lt. B. tells me.  "Oh yeah? In what?"  "I can't remember."  "Not criminal science?"  "No."  "Sociology? Psychology?"  "No. No, it's something weird. Something funny. I can't remember. What was it he said?"  "Anthropology?"  "No."  "English?"  "No. It's something funny. Something you wouldn't think of. Like clown school, something like that."   "Clown  school?"  "Oh yeah. Safety engineer, that's what it was. He was a safety engineer."  Yes, Lt. Exactly like clown school.

      The best part about  urlLink Troy  was when Paris (Orlando Bloom) passed the sword of Troy to a young man limping along with his father.  "What's your name?" Paris asked the man.  "Aeneas," the man replied.  Aeneas goes on to wander at sea for years; his descendants eventually found the Roman Empire.   I felt smug about noticing this detail, especially when, while waiting outside the bathrooms after the movie I overheard this conversation:  Woman: I can't believe they killed Brad Pitt. He's such a hottie.  Man: Uh.  Woman: I can't believe they used the horse like that!  Man: Well you've heard of the Trojan Horse, right?  Woman: Yeah. But I didn't know they used it like that!  Man: Well what did you think they did?  Woman: I thought they used it to sail back to Greece!

      The girl is pissy today.   She is still licking her wounds and the smell of blood is tempting her back into attack mode.  Her eyelids are itching and when she rubs her eyelashes they fall out and smear mascara into her eyes. Her eyes sting and tear up.  Aaargh!

      The police use words like "Tango", "Hotel", and "Juliet" to avoid confusion when calling in letters on license plates.   Sometimes, one of the sergeants told me, the officer can't readily remember the word that corresponds to the letter, especially letters like "U" and "Z."  Then he burst out laughing. "I remember this one officer who was trying to remember the word for 'z' and he couldn't think of it. So finally he said 'Xerox.'"

      The panic hit and I was rambling.  "What if it  was  stupid? You know? Do you think it was? Why do I always have to worry about stupid shit like this? What's wrong with me? Do other people go through this kind of shit or what?"  I thought Baron, the photographer, was listening. But when I turned to face him, I found he him slouched in the sports writer's chair. He was rubbing an orange baseball against the top of his head with a blank expression.  "Baron! Are you even  listening  to me? Well it's obvious you don't think my problems are important."  Baron blinked twice and looked at me, still rubbing the ball against the top of his head. "Huh? What?"   "What are you doing with that ball? Don't you  care  about my problems?"  "Oh. I don't know. Problems? What problems?"  I dropped my face into my hands and burst out laughing.  Funny thing. I forget what I was worrying about.

      Ahhh...11:30 a.m. on a sparkling Saturday in Hilo. A breeze flutters through my window, birds chirp in the background.   This day is like a blank, sunny canvas and there is so much I could be doing.   But instead I have found an excuse for not doing anything.   I am waiting for my laundry to finish.  As lame excuses go, this is pretty much the apex since I'm doing my laundry at home, not a laundromat and therefore am not obligated to sit around waiting for it to finish.  I've been petering in and out of moodiness all weekend; I can't decide which side of the fence I want to be on.  As far as moodiness goes though, there is no better place to be moody than at home with my parents.  When you are moody, you need to be alone, basically. If you are around most people when you are really moody they will:  1) Try to cheer you up and   2) Grow annoyed or disgusted when the effort fails  This is NOT conducive to moodiness because once the other person grows annoyed or disgusted you may begin to feel guilty. You may put on a false face of cheerfulness in the hopes of alleviating the annoyance and thus, the guilt. Beware. This is bad. BAD. Because forcing yourself to be cheerful could lead to feelings of resentment towards the other person. The situation could esculate and get ugly.  This leads me back to my point of why it's great to be moody at my parents' house. Nine times out of 10 they are moody too. And like most moody people they are self-absorbed. So if you happen to be moody too, you can get away with it so long as you don't fall into steps 1 and 2 as mentioned above.  Basically I can hang around here and be moody and I won't be completely alone but the people who are around will just leave me alone. Moodiness is expected here. You needn't feel self-concious about it.  Anyway, back to my petering position on the fence. I am wondering if it may be worth it to drag myself out of this grumpy funk.   Chris called last night when I was REALLY grumpy, and he was just frickin' exuberant. As a compromise, instead of being grumpy I opted for neutral but even through the exuberance he could tell I wasn't being as humorous as usual.   Anyway, he said he wanted to do something really fun when he got back on Tuesday.  "Oh no," I replied, ditching neutral for good and embracing the grumpiness. "Fun? Like what?"  "You don't like fun?" he said. "Fun makes you grumpy?"  (This was actually an alarmingly succinct summarization. People who know me for years haven't been able to sum up my attitude that readily).  Anyway, he pointed out that it's boring to sit around the house all day all the time -- a point that in my current moat of moodiness, I could have argued but (probably wisely) chose not to.   But hearing him say all this made me think of my co-workers and the long litany of other acquaintances throughout the years who have constantly been bugging me to go out and have "fun."  In many ways I am still where I was all those years ago. Wondering if maybe there IS something wrong with me because I don't like to go out and socialize, etc. OR if I should just accept myself as I am and stop working to improve myself.  Maybe I should see a shrink?

      I say "I know" a lot.  It conveys empathy, it conveys understanding, it can even convey regret.  I think it's overused, though, and I have been trying to eradicate it. I was already trying when I had this conversation with some cops about a fellow officer who had hit a pedestrian while on patrol:  "Well, I was driving down that same street and it was really, really crowded," I said. "There was just so much activity going on. And then as I was driving this huge group of tourists just walked out right in front of me. I mean, I could have hit them. That gave me quite a scare. So I know how scary it must be to hit someone like that. I understand how you could probably panic."  The cop looked uncomfortable and said, "Yeah."  Then I thought about what I had just said and added, "Well actually, maybe I  don't  know. Maybe almost hitting someone and actually hitting someone are two totally different things. Maybe I have no idea what it's like. I think I say 'I know' too much."  The cop kind of chuckled, but no longer looked as uncomfortable.

      I am so easily stressed out sometimes (a lot of times) I wonder how it is I haven't taken up smoking or drinking.   My dad smokes like a chimmney. Has since he was 13 or 14. It seems that smoking would be relaxing what with all the deep breathing, especially exhaling, that is involved.   As it is, I don't even drink coffee.  I tried drinking those frou-frou alcoholic drinks but the combination of sugar and alcohol makes me throw up. All the time. Without fail. I can drink a beer or two but I don't like the taste of beer.  I should take yoga or an aerobics class. Maybe kick-boxing.  It's a good thing I have this writing thing as an outlet.

      I ran into a woman I recognized but couldn't place while in line at the local Subway. She looked at me as though she recognized but couldn't place me either.  "Do you work at the police station?" I asked at last.  "Yeah. Are you Steve's daughter?"  "Yeah, yeah. How do you know my dad?"  "Oh, I used to work in dispatch and he would come by sometimes. Funny you don't look anything like him."  Yeah funny. Everyone tells me this, but I can feel my father living in me, right under my skin.

      I am thinking of  urlLink Jo , or more specifically about one of her more recent posts. I've never met Jo before but so far she is the only one to bother to comment on this site of mine. OK. That's not true. Chris commented under an alias, but he knows me, even claims to genuinely like me. Therefore he's disqualified.    Anyway Jo was talking about how she spaces out and procrastinates when it comes time to doing things she dislikes. At first she seemed really concerned about this characteristic of hers, then she decided she was just a pleasure junkie and went to get a snack.    I think I suffer from a related illness, Jo. I call mine avoidance.   For instance, I hate my job. The intensity of my hatred varies somewhere between barely noticeable/somewhat rewarding to I-have-to-quit-now- now- now  .    But alas, I have not quit. Mostly because I have my father's voice in my head and when I get close to doing something reckless it screams, What's the mattah with you? You  stupid  or what? I really think you're stupid.    I think of telling my friends about my latest dilemna but I already know what they will say: Did you send out your resume? Why don't you send out your resume? You never know unless you try, you know.    I have also avoided booking a trip for me and Grandma M. to Cousin Erin's wedding in Chicago until almost the last possible moment. I avoided calling Uncle Alan, who's coming along, to tell him whether I bought the ticket or not.     I am avoiding talking to B, the photographer, ever since he called to chew me out for behaving "selfishly" and taking his friendship for granted. And I have avoided hanging out with Maile because she hangs out with B and there is a remote, distant, but possible chance of drama and picking of subjects that will make me uncomfortable.    In fact, I've been avoiding almost all social engagements. Sitting around at a noisy bar while everyone else gets drunk and tries to make me talk is terrifying and draining and overwhelming and I will not enjoy myself. In fact, I will go home and feel like a loser for exactly those reasons.    The voices are telling me it's stupid, I really am behaving stupidly. Some other voices are telling that voice to shut up. I have my father's voice growing frantic, "What for you need go out? You really go out to that kind place?" I have the voices of my co-workers teasing and bugging and calling me lame for not going out.     The list of things I am avoiding or not adequately addressing goes on and on and on. But this is overwhelming. I want to avoid getting into it.    What I need is an exorcism, something to drain all these different people who have somehow weaseled in my mind and taken over. As soon as I wrote that line one of them popped in with this snide remark: Well  somebody  has to be in control here, since obviously  you  can't handle the responsibility.    I started this post talking about Jo. Now I realize it was misleading. Like I said, I've never met her but she is likely to be far saner than I am. She makes handmade soap, which I think is really, really cool. If you are reading this, Jo, please send me info. on handmade soap. I swear I'm not as loopy as this post makes me seem.

      What follows is an actual conversation among my co-workers (all of whom have been hired from the mainland) about using the okina in articles. The okina is a punctuation mark, shaped like a backwards apostrophe, used to signal the halting of breath between vowels of certain Hawaiian words. Currently, our policy is to exclude all okinas and kahakos unless exclusion would change the meaning of the word (i.e. ka'u instead of kau).    A: What is the name of that place again?    C: I don't know. It started with a 'K'. 'K', 'E', something...oh I don't remember.    A: Yeah it was really weird spelling. There was a space between the K and the E or something.    C: Yeah, all these places have really long names with the space thing in between. And I always put the thing in the words like they're supposed to be but R takes them out all the time. I don't know why he does that. Like this word looks weird spelled 'P', 'U', 'U', without a space between the two U's."    A: No shit.    T: I think we should include that thing between the letters like they're supposed to be. I think it makes us look ignorant and culturally insensitive that we don't include it.    C: Yeah. This is just making us look more stupid.    Me: What are you guys talking about? The okinas?    T: Is that what they're called? I guess we would look less ignorant if we actually learned what the thing is called, huh?    C: Better than me. I don't even say 'the thing' I just go like this. (She paws the air with her hand, roughly drawing an apostrophe in the air).

      Aaron has been here less than a month.     He is a very bright guy. He's already been to India, Thailand and a bunch of other places to take pictures for publications. He's graduating from a prestigious mainland photography school at the end of the year. He might take a trip to Greece to photograph the Olympics in Athens. He has state-of-the-art laptop and fancy camera with all kinds of expensive accessories.     At dinner the other day he turned to me and said, "Andrea says I should go up to a Hawaiian girl and say, 'Hey, I want to fuck you.' What do you think my chances are? Close to none or none?"    Andrea, sitting across from Aaron, giggles. "Hey it never hurts to try."    "Well it might, depending on where the girl's boyfriend is standing," I quipped.    Aaron turns to the local guy Andrea is currently seeing and repeats his querry.     The guy offers a half smile and this witty comeback: "Well it depends on a lot of factors. Like how much the girl weighs, how much kids she get, whether her boyfriend is still in jail. Actually, I think you got a pretty good chance my friend."    Andrea laughs. "I just want to see you try and fail, Aaron."    A bunch of kids at the next table over start making noise and Aaron says, "So I hear a lot of the girls pop 'em out young here."    "Doesn't that happen in California?" I reply.    "No, not really," he says. Then to the local guy, "Is it true that the girls here have a lot of kids when they're really young? That's the word I hear anyway."    The guy gives that half smile. "Well, I had my first kid when I was 17. She's 14 now I think."    Aaron stares.    The guy nudges Andrea and bursts out laughing.    Aaron looks sheepish. "Ah, ha ha. Yeah, I'm gullible and you know it too."    Pause.    "Hey man," Aaron tells the guy. "You know where I can get some weed?"    The guy takes a sip of Andrea's soup and looks at Aaron.    "I'm just going to be really blunt here, man, and ask."    The guy tells Aaron he'll talk to a co-worker.    We wrap up dinner. I feel like throwing up. Aaron is the type of guy that is going to be in charge of things in a few years: Smart, well traveled, fluent in several languages, personable and completely and totally ignorant and insensitive.

      I remember the day Grandma M baked homemade doggie biscuits for Li Po.  Li Po lived with Grandma and Grandpa M from puppy time until the age of 7 or 8. He was a father's day gift for Grandpa, but it was Grandma who took an interest in his upbringing.  Grandma made enough doggie biscuits to fill at least three large tupperware containers with the bone-shaped treats. All natural ingredients.   Grandma was on a mission to have Li Po shed 5lbs.  "Boy, you're such a fat doggie, boy," she'd tell him.  She had him on a strict regimin: He could be no more than 15 lbs. According to a doggie book, this is how much a Lhasa Apso-mix like Li Po is supposed to weigh at most.  As I recall, Li Po was not too impressed by the snacks, the diet or, to be frank, Grandma in general.  Grandma's way of showing affection is to fuss over you until you think your eyes will pop or steam will shoot from your ears.  My brother, in a fit of insubordinate frustration, once swore at her. She dragged him upstairs by the ear and washed his mouth out with soap and water while he screamed.  So Grandma had ideas for Li Po. One of them was that he would look like a show dog. She knew he could never BE a show dog.  "You no can be show dog, you. You not a purebred," she would tell Li Po, at least once a week.  Li Po, by all appearnces, was unoved.  To make him LOOK like a show dog, she patently refused to cut his hair. When it got matted and tangly, she'd haul him into the bathroom, place him on the counter and go at it with the doggie comb and brush.  I think this is how Li Po learned to snarl and bark.  When it was time for a bath, she insisted on following the shampoo directions to the T. If it said soak for 15 minutes, Li Po would shiver in the sink for 15 minutes.  I think this is how he learned to yelp and whine.  Grandma never learned to pet Li Po properly either. If he happened to be near by, she'd pull him--growling--next to her and start slapping at his head. His growl would deepen.  "Grandma, you're HITTING him," I'd say.  But she was oblivious.   "Oh Li Po, why you growl?" she'd ask. "You not a good lap dog, eh, Li Po?"  This is my Grandma.

      The other day I was complaining to Chris about how fat I was getting (I know, I know, gross girly attitude) and his mother joked that he was trying to fatten me up so the family could eat me.    Ha, ha people.    Fine. If you're going to eat me, you should at least prepare me properly. I'd suggest broiling me with ginger and soy sauce. Or perhaps frying me and serving me with rice. Something simple like that. I really wouldn't appreciate being smeared in butter or breaded. I think finishing me off with a light dessert like angel cake or sherbert would work best. No chocolate ice cream please. And keep my bones; you could use them to make soup the next day.

      I love to eat but never learned to cook. In my family, a home cooked meal was a loco moco from Cafe 100.    Awhile back I had an urge to learn to cook, and start a blog about the experience. (I had it all mapped out in my mind--I'd start by presenting the recipe of the dish I wanted to prepare, followed by a description of what happened while I cooked and how the dish turned out).   Well, I never got around to cooking so there wasn't much point in starting the blog.   But yesterday I cooked. I made miso soup and lasagna. Both recipes came straight off the food packaging. Regardless they turned out remarkably well. Chris' mom even had seconds of the lasagna.   The next thing I want to try and make is this miso-based salad dressing/dipping sauce (recipe also found on the packaging).

      Meet Pooler. I don't know if it's his first name or last name. He didn't tell me and I didn't ask.  Pooler repairs shoes and builds custom shoes in a tiny shack somewhere between Captain Cook and Ka'u. I've driven by his "Shoe Repairs" sign many times without stopping.  Today, Chris and I stopped. That's how we met Pooler, a short man in a black leather vest, jeans, and tatoos. He's missing a lot of teeth (I spotted a bunch of them piled in an astray on his work table) and greeted us barefooted. He looks to be somewhere between 50 and 60 years old.  Pooler charges about $150 for a pair of personalized sandals and $700 for a pair of personalized boots. He said he's swamped with work.  "I'm here at 6 a.m. and I'm still working at midnight," he said.  He let me and Chris wander around his workshop, which is no bigger than the size of a toolshed, and showed us a boot he was working on. Part of it was made out of elephant ear.  "Elephant ear?" Chris said. "How do you get an elephant ear?"  "Well you just jump up on the elephant and cut it off," Pooler replied.  He said he gets many visitors like me and Chris -- folks that have driven by before and stop on a whim to find out what his place is all about.  The doors to his shack are lined with pictures of boots he's made. Being the only guy on the island that does this, I guess he's generated a small amount of fame. Posing in a pair of black boots with the logo of the U.S. Congress was Rep. Neil Ambercrombie. (I remember his successful re-election campaign some years back; everyone seemed to have a bumper sticker that read: ABC, Ambercrombie Back to Congress).  According to his business card, Pooler will duplicate or fix any type of shoe. But he admitted to us that he's been forced to be more selective because of the heavy workload.  "It's hard to start charging people more. Some of these people who want their shoes repaired hardly have any money anyway," he said.

      Aaron is our new photo intern. I had my first assignment with him on Sunday to interview a couple living "off the power grid."    Aaron drives a green Kia Rio rental car that makes him feel like "one of those elephants on a tricycle in the circus."    To get to the couple we had to go down a long, windy, gravely road with many dips and pot holes. Technically you didn't need a 4-wheel-drive vehicle. Technically.    "Wow, this is awesome, this is what it's all about, you know what I mean?" Aaron was exuberant as we bounced down the road. "Uh-oh, pot hole up ahead, that's not going to be good. OK, OK. It's all good. That was fun don't you think? This is fun. It's going to be all good."    Aaron and I were late because Aaron forgot to bring a memory card for his digital camera so he had to make a last minute stop at the local Radio Shack.    Andrea describes Aaron as "a real kick in the pants, isn't he?"    I found it nearly impossible to believe anyone could be as genuinely happy as he seemed.    I'm still not sure it was genuine, to tell you the truth, but I let myself get sucked in anyway.    The highlight of the assignment: After a quick stop to take pictures, Aaron got back into the car without bothering to remove the two bulky cameras hanging from thick straps around his neck. He drove the rest of the way like that, hunched over the steering wheel, cameras swinging at every pothole, non-stop jabber.    This image of him, so absurd, is what inspired this entire post.    "This is what I love about my job, you know?" he enthused, thinking nothing of pushing 30 in a car meant only for paved roads. "Every day is an adventure. I get to come out here hang out with people and look at this scenery...This is paradise. THIS is paradise."    Finally I put a hand on his shoulder and said, "Aaron this is hilarious. I am going to write a New Yorker style profile about you, about driving down some random back road with you. I write that kind of stuff you know, but just haven't sold it yet. So your job is to get famous so I can sell it."    This caused a momentary pause. Then,    "OK. OK. Sure. I can do that. I'll work on it. It's a deal..."

      Last weekend, I watched my grandmother make her way across the street, stumbling over exposed tree roots. Grandpa walked ahead of her, her purse tucked under his arm.    "Eh, your grandfather better help Grandma before she falls down again," Auntie said.    "They look so cute though," Kayrn said, moving closer to her boyfriend Kenny. "He's carrying her purse for her. Look."    I doubled back and looped my arm through Grandma's and we walked together through the dark parking lot. Grandpa was already at the truck, climbing in, ready to go.    We had just finished having a family dinner to celebrate Grandma and Grandpa's 50th wedding anniversary.    During the dinner I looked at Auntie and said, "It's a miracle anybody in this family managed to stay married to another person in this family for 50 years."    I've only known Grandma for 23 of those 50 years. Less than 20 if you only count the years I can remember.    She and Grandpa went through some rough times. There were moments when the marriage could have collapsed.     I remember her shaking sometimes, she was so angry at him, so frustrated. Last year she left him for about a week, went to live with Auntie. He begged her to come back and when she refused he bought her a new washing machine and dryer to woo her back.    Grandma was never the type to really leave.    If she left, she used to say, her kids would never know their father. The family is the most important thing.    This is a belief she passed on to my father.    When my parents would argue, Dad would always give in. He couldn't leave his family.     I remember when I was a kid I feared his temper and I wished he WOULD leave. Make my life easier. I thought I would never be like my dad. I would go to a mainland college and get a job and never come home.     But it hasn't been that way at all.    I can never really leave my family either. I always find myself thinking about them, about what they would think about what I'm doing, about what kind of advice they would give me in any given situation.    I guess what I am trying to get at is a question I posed to some of my friends awhile back: Whether they thought the stories of their lives began with their birth or years before, with the births of their grandparents or great-grandparents.    I think in America there's a tendency to see ourselves as the great Individual.    The 50 years of our grandparents' marriage don't matter that much.    I thought of that last weekend, when I found myself arm and arm with my grandmother walking through a dark parking lot. About all the things in her life that I don't even know about, that led to my being there with her, the two of us making fun of Grandpa and picking our way over tree roots.    I think I'll know my story when I know my family's.

            I was at loss as to what to post so I looked over at Chris, sprawled across my couch with a Arizona iced-tea tucked against his side. I was about to ask him for a topic, but  before I could say a word he shrugged and said,     "I like Nelly."    I looked the other way at the TV, to find scantily clad women shaking it in Nelly's latest video.    I looked back at Chris, who until this moment has always expressed contempt for rap. As far as I could gather he likes Tom Petty and John Mellencamp and stuff like that.    "I don't know," he continued. "I just like his voice. Didn't he do that song--"    "It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes?" I said.    "No. No. That song....it goes....'must be the money'?"    "Oh yeah, yeah. I think he did."    "That song. I remember it came on the radio and I thought, 'Wow I like that rap song.'"     Uh-huh.    "He's got flow, you know?"    "All his songs sound the same."    "I know. He definitely has a formula."    And at least he's not wearing that band-aid on his face anymore.    Actually, I think Chris is trying to be nice by watching MTV because I jokingly accused him of only watching CNN. Now that the Nelly video is over he has flipped it over to the Style Network.     Now the Food Network.    The Food Network had the best dating show I've ever seen: Date Plate. It goes like this: two guys are selected to cook a meal (main course and dessert) for a girl. She tastes each guy's cooking and goes on a date with whichever guy's cooking she prefers. The guys each get a professional chef to help them prepare their menus.

      I spent an hour and a half at the court house watching the preliminary hearing for the first of seven suspects arrested in connection with a big fight at a secluded beach, unfold.  The last time I saw the suspect, he had a wild 'fro and wore an orange jumpsuit and slippers. He has since bailed out and shaved his head so I didn't recognize him until he shuffled over to the defense table.  Sometimes the defendents mutter under their breaths or write notes to their lawyers or swear at the cops on the stand (this gets an immediate contempt from the judge) but for the most part they just sit there with their head down or stare straight ahead blankly. If they're not in the orange jumpsuit, it would be hard to imagine some of them doing whatever it was they were arrested for. (But unfortunately for them, they're usually in the orange jumpsuit).  Such was the case for this particular suspect, who according to testimony from a cop, had been shouting racial slurs and threatening cops at the time of his arrest.  The attorneys can be equally entertaining to watch, even though you only get to see their backs.  The defense attorney is good, albeit flamboyant. During the cross-examination he asked the judge to "tell the deputy prosecuting attorney to please sit down. She's distracting me."  The deputy prosecuting attorney managed to eek out, "I will certainly sit" without giving the defense attorney the evil eye. (She avoided eye contact completely).  These two attorneys spent the entire hour and a half objecting to each other's questions.  The poor witness, a cop still new to the department, looked bewildered by the end of it. He must have asked them to repeat questions half a dozen times.   I felt bad for him.  Also part of today's cast of characters was a reporter for one of the Honolulu papers. He is very experienced, I could tell.  Whereas I was wondering whether to describe the defendent's polo shirt as "heather gray" or "white" he had such informed questions as, "What are the list of charges? Is there a possibility that he will serve time in prison consecutively if convicted?"  And whereas I was internally chuckling at how it would be so in character for the defense attorney to clean his client up for this hearing, he got on the phone and called his editors to let them know what he would be turning in.

      Yes I have returned to Hilo. (And yes, Dad has a new method of torturing Li Po).    My grandparents are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary and the whole family is set to gather at a fancy hotel buffet. The fact that anyone in my family has successfully survived 50 years with another person in my family is a miracle.     Not much has changed here:    Mom and Dad still pay more attention to the TV or the computer than each other.    There is take-out in the refrigerator because no one cooks.    My brother is nowhere to be found.    Li Po still chases his ball, but it's harder now because he is blinder.    Speaking of Li Po, I think he's given up on me. I haven't been home in so long (well, three weeks but that's really long) that I doubt he considers me part of the family. He gave me exactly 15 seconds of attention when I walked through the door -- long enough to follow me up the hall to my room -- then he ditched me for Mom.

      Management in all its wisdom has decided to expand the office space by knocking down the wall separating us from the dark room. Dark rooms are a thing of the past anyway. The photogs all use digital now.  A week ago the guy contracted to knock the wall down took the clock off the wall. Three days past and nothing more happened.  I told Andrea I was convinced management was paying the contractor by the hour, starting from the moment the clock was removed.  The wall has finally come down though.   Yesterday I watched Ken the computer guy sawing  a hole to create an additional electrical outlet for the new expanded area. I found it endlessly amusing because Ken is such a small, bouncy, good natured guy. It was like watching Snoopy saw.  Everyone else was giving him death stares though because the sawing sounded like "fingernails scraping a chalkboard," as Ken cheerfully described it.  Anyway, one of my co-workers caught my eye as we watched the sawing. "You know," he said. "Someone should tell Ken the ladies bathroom is on the other side of that wall."  Fortunately, it wasn't RIGHT on the other side. There was some space in between.  Nonetheless a couple of secretaries came out of the bathroom and saw Ken. "Oh so that was YOU making all that noise!" they exclaimed.

      I spend a lot of time worrying about other people think and how they will react.  My boss for instance, barely says two words to me all day and when he does it is usaully something like, "Good job. I really appreciate your doing that."   Yet I am convinced he is secretly resentful of me and finds my work to be sub-standard. He just doesn't have the balls to say it to my face and fire me.  I feel bad when I don't go out drinking with my co-workers because I'm afraid they'll think I'm a loser and stop talking to me during work hours. (Who will I share my lunch break with?) But  when I don't go out, they just shrug when they see me the next morning and say, "We didn't really expect you to show up anyway."  Then they ask me if I'm hungry and want to join them on their dinner break and I say yes because I AM hungry and because I SHOULD do some socializing even though it costs money.  I think the moral of the thing, which I'm not doing a good job of illustrating, is that by worrying so much about other people's crazy reactions I am ignoring my own crazy thought patterns.  Over analyzation sucks though, because I always come to the conclusion that I shouldn't give a shit, should just mind my own business and do my own thing. I am happily on this track when someone in my life (friend, crazy father, etc.) will give me a reality check in the form of a "you're a really spoiled, selfish, ingrate" speech that will throw me off-kilter.  I'll feel bad about myself, feel resentful towards them, convince myself they are nuts and its psychologically damaging for me to be around them, feel guilt, convince myself that I am crazy for spending so much time thinking about it....  Start again at top.

       On the local newspaper's redesign   "So I was shocked when I saw the new newspaper!" Maile exclaimed as she climbed into my car. "I mean it was huge! So big! I wasn't used to seeing it that big! But you know what? There were only one or two local stories in the whole thing."  "Well, it's bigger alright," Baron agreed. "It's a great size for making paper hats."  Maile laughed. "Oh yeah?"  "Yeah. And also boats."  "I imagine it's also good for lining bird cages," Maile added.  "Nah," I said. "Too big. I bet the old paper was the perfect size for bird cages."  "But it's good for dogs," Baron interjected.   On the Middle East conflict   We arrive at the Kona Brewing Co. and Maile is still chanting the cheer she learned from a British friend in China:  "Who ate the pie? Who ate the pie? You fat bastard! You fat bastard! You ate the pie!"  Occasionally she even strikes a cheerleader pose.  The cheer refers to Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister who, I guess, the British consider a "fat bastard."   On the state of toilets   Waiting for our meal to arrive at the Kona Brewing Co., Maile strikes up a conversation with fellow world-trotter Jim, about the international state of toilets.  "Literally, in China, there are people peeing on troughs!" Maile exclaimed. "They have these stalls, without doors and you have to stick your elbows out like this---" She pauses to demonstrate, sticking her elbows out like a chicken. "--to balance while you're peeing. Everytime I go out there are always these little Chinese women squatting over these troughs."  Sometimes, there isn't even a trough. Just a hole in the ground and you have to squat over that.  "These people think they're going to take over the world!" Maile exclaimed. "They can't even make a seat for their toilet. I mean, how do these people enjoy their newspaper while taking a crap? You can't! You're too busy concentrating on squatting!"  "Well maybe they use their toilet time to do other things," I suggested. "Maybe they're contemplating larger world issues as they squat."  "Like what?" Maile exclaimed. "They're not reading the paper!"  "Although it is rather amazing given all the contemplation time that they haven't contemplated inventing a toilet seat," I added.  "But I was thinking about this," she continued. "And I think that there is a great business opportunity for me. I already discussed it with one of my friends at the University and he agreed with me. I want to contact someone in the government and have them hire me as a toilet consultant."  "A what?!"  "A toilet consultant. That way when Westerners come to China for these conferences I can go in and test all the toilets and see how they rate. I can tell them how they could make things better, like if the toilet paper dispenser is too low, for instance."  "Sounds like the toilet paper dispenser is the least of their problems."  "Oh, it is."  "But it'll be great," I said. "You could print up business cards: Maile....she's full of shit."  "Ha ha ha ha. Or how about this? Maile...she's a royal flush!"

      My friend Maile is back from teaching English in China. She'll be returning to Beijing at the end of the month.   I asked her what she wanted to do while back at home.   "Eat burritos. Eat pizza. Eat a tofu sandwich from BaLe. Eat chocolate," she said.  "Ah. So you want to eat."  We started with burritos.  The burritos from Tacos El Unico fell short of what she'd remembered.   "What did you think it was going to taste like?"  "Like heaven in a tortilla. But this is not heaven in a tortilla. This is like...the Hyatt in a tortilla."  (Mental note: Too bad Maile's going back to China. I would tell her to apply for the Honolulu Advertiser's restaurant reviewer position).  The tofu sandwich from BaLe met better reviews. Maile had especially missed the crisp, crunchy French bread they use there. It was everything she remembered. Plus, Max, the owner comped our meal and gave us free coconut flavored ice cream.  This is the real magic of eating your way through town with Maile. You are bound to run into someone she knows, and they are bound to be so delighted to see her that you leave with free stuff or invitations to do stuff.  "You're like a fucking celebrity here," I told her between spoonfuls of ice cream.  She laughed. "Not really."  "Whatever. Everybody remembers you and wants to you come home."  "Fuck that. Although the girl at Tacos El Unico remembered me. When I walked in she said, 'Maile! You're back from teaching English in China!' I didn't think she even knew my name."  "What?! That girl barely says two words in English to me."  "Well I used to eat there a lot."  "Whatever. Andrea ALWAYS eats there. She has a thing for Mexican guys and all the Mexican guys hang out there. But the girl hardly talks to her either. But then again, Andrea didn't once suggest that the girl rig a pulley to deliver burritos to her apartment window."  "Hey, that was a good idea."

      Here is where I'd like to be now:  On a beach, but maybe a man made beach that is indoors. Or maybe in a house with glass walls with the beach right outside. An empty beach just rocks and sand and ocean. And I would be curled in bed, like a cat, with a mug of tea and a book. I could look up through the glass ceiling and see the trees dropping their leaves onto the roof.  Yes, I think I need a vacation, or at least more time to read.  But speaking of reading, I went to an eye doctor the other day and she told me that staring at a computer screen and reading has caused my eyesight to worsen.  She suggested I look at a point 20 feet away from my computer screen every few minutes for 20 seconds to let my eyes focus on something else.  This I can do. Stare off into distance and find that blank space to paint with my mind. That is a kind of reading too, isn't it?

      This I remember about Hilo. There is always rain. Shari, Ashley and I hunch in front of my house in bathing suits and shorts, plastic buckets stacked at our feet. We are chanting, “Stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain.” We feel like Indians invoking an ancient ritual. It rains in sheets, a low, steady roar and you can smell it on the asphalt. The weeds in my yard thrive on the constant showers. The rain flushes out the poison my dad had sprayed the day before and the weeds grow taller, stronger, more resiliant. Eventually, the rain slows to a drizzle. The three of us stand up, hopeful and excited. My dad is settled on the couch, watching TV, chowing down on cold scrambled eggs, rice and bacon. “It stopped raining,” I tell him. “It’s going to start again,” he replies without looking up. “Yeah but...” “We can go another day,” he says. “But we’re going to get wet anyway --” “No.” He stops eating to fix his gaze on me. The meaning is unmistakable. I stomp out of the room but he calls me back, his voice sharp. “What?” I snap. “Watch yourself,” he says, gaze still unshakable. I swallow my rage and leave quietly this time. Ashley and Shari are waiting by the screen door with expectant faces. “He said no,” I say. “How come?” I shrug. “Is he mad?” Again, I shrug. “Your dad is a grouch,” Shari says. “No shit. Will your parents take us?” Ashley snorts. “No way. They won’t want to get off their lazy asses.” “I don’t want to talk to my dad anyway,” Shari adds. “He’s getting on my nerves.” We wander back to our buckets and sit there in sulky silence, watching the rain drip from the roof.   This is from a series of short pieces I wrote about Hilo rain

         Now that Jake is used to riding in the truck he was excited when Chris and Karen said they would take him to a beach.     Jake is not a water dog. He grew up in Ka'u, surrounded by lava rock.     So when he got to the beach he immediately went exploring.     He found a tidepool with little hermit crabs.     He found a place where water gushed right out of the earth. It was more water than he had ever seen.     And since it was getting hot, he decided,  what better way to cool down then to take a sip?         "I wouldn't do that if I were you," Chris said.     But Jake ignored him. He kept on drinking until suddenly....he didn't feel so good and began throwing up.     So Chris and Karen took him home and gave him fresh water. Then he went to sleep and dreamed of a beach where all the water was fresh.

      Sometimes when I'm out on assignment I get to meet genuinely neat people.  Such was the case with Alan and Daren, taiko instructors for the Kona Hongwanji Mission. Daren and Alan seem to have a genuine enthusiasm for taiko. It's charming.  I met them on Wednesday. They said they would show me their o-daiko drum, a drum the Hongwanji has had for more than 50 years, so that I could take a picture for the paper. I figured this would take about five to ten minutes.  But Alan and Daren dragged out six shimi-daiko drums  and  the o-daiko drum. Then Mel, the president of the Kona Hongwanji Taiko Group arrived with his 6-year-old son. Then Emma, a haole girl and the group's best drummer, showed up.  They ended up putting on a little show for me, with recorded music in the background and all.  Then, against my better judgement, I allowed them to convince me to try my hand at the shimi-daiko.  I didn't do so well. When the song ended, I was charigned.  "I'm sorry," I told Daren. "I think I kind of suck at this."  "No, no, you did pretty good especially for a first try," Daren said.  I looked at him skeptically.  "I'll tell you what you did that was really good. Several times you noticed you were off rhythm and you stopped."  I burst out laughing. "So stopping is good?"  "Yeah, yeah. Stopping  is  good. A lot of people, they don't even know they're off rhythm they just keep going and going."  When I got home I told Chris this story and he laughed and laughed.  Yeah, stopping is good.

I don't know what the deal is.  And I noticed you now have to be a blogspot member to comment. This wasn't always so. That's too bad...  Anyway, I'm working on a sequel to "Jake's Adventure." Until then I'll try to post something entertaining.

        The Middle Earth Book Shoppe has been here for more than 30 years. The owner has 60 days to get out. The new landlord has doubled the rent and he can't afford to stay.  My friend Maile introduced me to the Middle Earth Book Shoppe when she got a job there last year.  It's no Border's and that's why I liked it. Borders is brightly lit with big signs marking each section but it never fails to overwhelm and confuse me.  Middle Earth is dimly lit and the carpet inside is old and flattened by thousands of feet wandering across it. The lighting is horrible and the shelves form mazes you could get lost in for hours. The books are in no particular order. I can't tell you how many times I've watched Maile, finger on lip, try to remember where it was she'd seen that book the customer was now asking for.  Every evening, before closing, Maile would vacuum the floor and shout, "We're closing now! Everybody out if you don't want to be locked in!" Every now and then a charigned customer would scramble out clutching a cache of books they want to purchase.  Customers have spent hundreds of dollars in a single visit at the Middle Earth Book Shoppe.  Chris said he bought a dictionary there that cost more than a $100. His mom has frequented the store since it opened more than 30 years ago.  Back then, she said, it was nothing but a tourist shop. She told Bob, the owner, that he should concentrate more on the local clientele and expand his offerings. Then she bought a Roget's Thesaurus from him.  "You know what this is for?" he sassed.  "Yes, I know what it's for," she retored. "I can even pronounce it."  That's how Bob is with his customers.  When I stopped by after a two month hiatus, the first thing he said to me was, "Maile was right. You  have  gained weight."  Bob and I had only met once before, and very briefly.  "I can't believe he told you that," Maile said. "I told him to be nice to you. I told him, that if he'd gotten you to stay at least 15 minutes longer you would have bought something. You can always be convinced to buy something."  Maile called me the first day of the closing sale and told me to come right away.  "I can't come now," I said. "I'm at work."  Maile said she had a bunch of books set aside for me, books that would otherwise be tossed.  "You know that's tantamount to blackmail," I told her. "You know I can't let you toss those books."  So me and Andrea went. The free books were piled in two grocery carts. The top layer contained dictionaries and thesauruses, the middle layer erotica and romance and the bottom layer Shakespeare.  Maile says I should write a story about the closing. It's the end of an era, she said, and speaks of the social and economic changes going on in Kona.  It's also a story about Bob, who's losing his life's work.  When I visited Bob tonight, I asked him if he would let someone from the paper interview him if we did decide to do a story.  "Only if it's you," he said.  Now I'll have to find out if he was serious.

      I don't know exactly how it happened but my parents have become monsters in my mind. This will sound strange because it's not like they're bad people really, and all of us are on speaking terms.  My dad once aspired to be an accountant but dropped out of community college when he realized his classmates weren't getting jobs. He became a fire fighter and worked his way up the rank (he got pretty high up) then retired at 47 and now sells equipment to the local fire and police stations.  My mom works for the utility company. She was a cashier at a grocery store when she met my dad. In her free time she plays Yahoo Games and does needlepoint.  My parents raised me well, I think. They raised me in a stable home, a home they own. They sent me to a fairly good public school and funded my college education. When I turned 12 or 13 they bought me an electronic word processor because they knew I liked to write. When I got to college, they bought me a laptop computer.  Now here I am. I have a job. A writing job. I haven't asked them, but I suspect my parents are satisfied by the outcome of my life thus far. College graduate with a professional job.  But I hate my job. I hate that I am still living in the place I was born and haven't really gotten to see or do much with my life. I hate that I have already reached the learning threshold at my job and peaked in less than five years.  Last night, Chris looked up from where he was mixing canned chicken and olives in a concoctioin he called "dinner" and said, "So you've never really rebelled against your parents, huh? How funny. We're so different like that. I never did anything my mom wanted me to do."  Chris, though, has his own motives for encouraging a rebellion. He thinks I should just move with him to the mainland where we can both find better jobs.  I on the other hand have avoided doing anything that would piss off my parents. That's not true. I've avoided doing things that would REALLY piss off my parents and neglected to tell them about the little fuck-ups along the way if I could get away with it. Not that there have been many really, all things considered.  Anyway, people who I have shared this internal struggle with all say the same thing: It's YOUR life, you might as well do what YOU want.  Which is difficult for me to swallow because I really think that so much of who I am has to do with family and history.  Then again, I had to cover a hearing on drug abuse yesterday and one of the treatment providers said the biggest problem he faces is convincing kids who grew up in families where drug use was the norm that they don't have to be like their relatives.

        This is Jake.    Jake doesn't like getting into the truck. Chris and Karen dragged him in anyway.    They went to Lapakahi State Park in North Kohala.    But Lapakahi State Park is a historical park and dogs aren't allowed on the beach. Poor Jake. He had to stay in the truck.    Then Chris, Karen and Jake went to Hawi Town in North Kohala. Poor Jake had to stay in the truck again, because Karen wanted to shop.  This time, though, Jake jumped out of the truck and ran up the road after Chris. Chris had to catch him and put him back in the truck. Again.    Finally, Chris, Karen and Jake went home. It was about time. Jake was tired.   The end
