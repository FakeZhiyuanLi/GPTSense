        I know how sanctimonious this must sound, but it's hard not to mull over how we've evolved into such self-indulgent creatures [not necessarily excluding oneself]. The sense of duty and regard for the common good both appear absent in the collective awareness.  It's useless to deny possession of a self-indulgent streak*, one that I rarely get to put into practice, but I've come across the occasional self-proclaimed epicurean now and again, whose regard for the fellow man seems somewhat absent, and whose contempt for the objects of their own condemnation even seems frighteningly missing - simply because they couldn't be bothered with matters unrelated to their own good selves.    A trace of sadism  According to philosophical theory, Epicureanism differs from hedonism insofar that the postulate of the latter is that  whatever causes pleasure is right , whereas Epicurus held that desires should be reduced, and that pleasure was obtained through knowledge, friendship and a virtuous and temperate life. Today's perception of Epicureanism is severely distorted into a modern type of hedonism, leaving us little else than the pursuit of personal pleasures. It is in effect quite similar to hedonism in its original form, and quite possibly a philosophy that a certain Donatien-Alphonse-François de Sade would approve of most heartily, I'm sure. I needn't go into the dreary details of the consequences for the alleged epicureans' surroundings. Suffice it to say, they're likely to be grave.   Entertained to death  To a certain extent we're all inclined to take up an epicurean [i.e. hedonistic] lifestyle, although it usually takes a very modest, however alarming, form. We must be entertained at all costs. Take journalism and the general coverage of news as an example. The angles are decided on in accordance with their effect on rating figures, leaving us with a type of journalism which chief objective is to entertain, rather than to inform. That is to say, the information side to the matter is a mere [and less interesting] side effect. Perhaps we're all suffering from Rimbaud's disease.  Much as I hate to admit it, I would appear to be more than just a little moralising, but I can assure you there's nothing more to these reflections than mere observations. I'll leave the condemning attitude to those who lack guilt in any respect.  *) For some reason I initially wrote "strike". God only knows what came over me.

       Originally I planned to spend the night at the Ullevål Stadium (the country's premier football arena), to see the Norway - Wales match with my two sons and a friend of theirs. I of all, who loathe everything even remotely connected with football. The thing is, I have this business associate, whose offices are situated in the very stadium itself, with windows overlooking the entire sports ground. Now and again, they invite clients to important matches, only this time no more than seven individuals were registered to attend, so they called the whole thing off, to the boys' disappointment - and mine [on their behalf, that is].  I suppose I'll have to make it up to the boys, one way or the other, but I really don't know where they've got it from, this keen interest in 22 Neanderthals and a leather ball. If it's in their genes, they'll have to come from their mother's side, unless I'm a ticking hooligan in disguise myself, just waiting to explode. Now there's an interesting thought. Please stop me, or I'll go on rambling.

      I have regarded framesets quite an anachronism for at least six or seven years by now and frankly, I still find them to be a relic of times long gone, but this one had me convinced that there truly are exceptions from the rule.  Go ahead and have a looksee.  urlLink {{{ black is good }}} { an inspirational corner }  is the name. Pretentious, I know. The main thing is; frames  do  work, when properly used.

      The spring of 2004 has been a really interesting one, in terms of working life and general business conditions, as one strike has followed the other in rapid succession. The latest development involves a new strike looming in the maritime sector, possibly resulting in Norwegian ferry crews going on strike this upcoming Friday.  Three days ago transport workers, who had been paralysing the entire grocery trade with denial of supplies, called off their nearly five week long strike. The newspaper journalists were on strike for about a week, whereas civil servants seem to have reached some sort of agreement with the employer side. Which is a crying shame, when you think about it, since parking attendants were among the potential strikers.  Be that as it may. The bottom line seems to be that strikes appear to have little effect on society at large. What point in a journalist strike when most Internet editions are maintained continuously, and several print editions still make it to the streets? Same thing goes for the grocery trade, really. No matter how much the organised workforce strikes, there will always be solutions for the employers, as well as for the consumers.  Seems to me they harm nobody but themselves, seeing as the inevitable result in many cases is flagging-out or shutting down the operations they try to harm, in order to increase wages, or whatever it is they try to achieve. The brewery workers were on strike for a day or two, until it became clear that the scenario was about to come true.  Strikers may not see this, but there's always the possibility that the target of their actions, namely the employers, are inflicted by strikes. What I don't understand, is why they fail to see how that compromises their very existence as employees. In other words, the question certain people ought to ask themselves, is "whom do the strikes actually strike?". But I sincerely doubt they ever will.  Good work, trade-union careerists! As usual.

        I've been tempted, more than once, to put neat little post-it notes on a variety of household appliances, informing whomever may stumble upon them that they're equally fit for use by the mistress of the house as they are by its master - if indeed that is a suitable term. The notes would probably go something like this:     Dishwasher:  Works, even in the absence of men    Washing machine:  Accepts female users too    Coffee machine:  Not likely to catch fire during use    Stove:  Ideal for cooking all sorts of meals - you really should try    Kitchen sink:  Has purposes other than storage facility for used cutlery and pans too    Bathinette & diaper dispenser:  Not necessarily off limits for moms when dads are at home   Also, it shouldn't surprise me if the supermarket cashiers even accept female punters, although we haven't put that to the test yet, so it's a bit of a shot in the dark.  One would intuitively surmise, from the imaginary post-it notes, that said mistress spends her days at work, whereas the husband tends to the house during office hours, albeit there's a distinct possibility that it would be a slightly misinformed assumption.  Tempted as I may be, I've limited myself to play with the  idea  of posting notes all over the place, but I guess this is as good a place as any. Note that any use of the word "paralysis" is purely coincidental.

      As I mentioned in a  urlLink posting  here earlier this month, I was surprised recently to find that top executives' knowledge of basic and widely known Shakespeare quotations often seems to be quite absent. But it won't stop there.  I'm just done editing a  urlLink magazine  (be warned: in Norwegian) aimed at senior executives. One of the articles contains the list of a major finance institution's history of mergers, and I just couldn't help myself, resulting in the following headline:  Per mergere ad astra , based on the well-known  Ad ardua ad astra  (through struggle to the stars) - only to find that it's not so well-known after all, judging by same top executives' reactions. Hard as it may be, I try not to be prejudiced, but how widely spread can we expect the problem to be? Does it qualify for the description at all [i.e. "problem"]? Is it fair to ask that much of the technically or commercially trained?  I have to admit that I'm biased enough to do just that, and really, I don't think I'm asking much.  By the way, I'm not entirely convinced that "mergere" is the correct inflection. My Latin really stinks. Honestly. But hey, given that I'm not a top executive, I consider myself excused.

      I'll have to make an exception from the rule here, as the matter at hand is of little interest to non-Norwegians. My apologies for that.  Ja vel, så er jeg en språk-freak (hvis du stusser over "freak", har jeg også visse problemer med norvagisering av lånord - enda jeg både skriver "sjåfør" og "etasje"), men man skal ikke være stort mer enn middels språkinteressert for å stusse over språkstandarden hist og her.  900.000 nordmenn leser og skriver så dårlig at de har problemer i jobben og på fritiden, hevder Dagbladet i en  urlLink artikkel i dag .  I samme utgave vil avisen ha det til at Liverpool-manager Gerard Houllier sier følgende til ryktene om sin avgang:   - Bare søppel.  Og det i  urlLink overskriften , sågar.  Nå er jeg ikke den som bryr seg for mye om fotballen, ut over å fastslå at den altså er rund, men her mer enn ante man hvilket ord man prøvde å formidle på norsk. Og riktig nok. Skal man tro  urlLink The Irish Times  (og det syns jeg), lød uttalelsen:   "I can't prevent or stop the rumours, but the speculation is a load of  rubbish . I am currently having meetings with the chief executive preparing for next season" (min uthevelse).   Til Dagbladets forsvar skal det dog tilføyes at artikkelen er skrevet av en sportsjournalist. Trolig blant de alt nevnte 900.000.

      We deal a lot with  Business Process Outsourcing  where I work, and I'm full aware that some people would argue that  urlLink outsourcing  is nothing but a postponement of regular staff cuts, and honestly, that may well be. But consider the alternative: immediate downsizing, affecting numerous employees with no secure options of retreat.  Even if the affected employees [being outsourced to a BPO provider, for instance] are in for an inevitable dismissal, chances are they'll keep their jobs for yet another few years, even though it's in a different company's service - serving their old employee, and then some, probably.  I'm not entirely convinced that workforce reductions and redundancies are the sole answers to whatever problems major corporations may have, but looking at the general development of things, it would appear so. So far, it has worked wonders for the overall rate of employment. If keeping it as low as possible is a matter of importance, that is.

      Having the opportunity of communicating absolutely anonymously in somebody else's name is a luxury I frequently make the most of, as my job is to make other people look their best in press releases, printed matter, presentations and such. I'm full aware of the disadvantages involved in cloaking one's person. For instance, the beneficiaries of your work take the credit for it. Or do they? Keep in mind that a skilled communicator has the liberty of putting loads of  urlLink corporate bullshit  into the mouths of those whom he serves. Now that's a thought, isn't it? Then again, said bullshit is exactly what they want, and after all we have to observe a certain level of customer satisfaction. So there you are.  Even if the work of a corporate  urlLink Cyrano de Bergerac  is rarely really appreciated, it still has a couple of perks - although I doubt that Roxanne fits into the equation.

      It is  urlLink Constitution Day  in this funny little place called Norway. On this day we put on our strange and obviously gipsy-inspired costumes in celebration of our country's splendour and our prominent position in world society, at least according to our self-conception (Norway, home of the giants, maker of peace, origin of goodness and general virtue and all that).  Amid the chauvinism and patriotism we like to make the day out to be the children's day, first and foremost, albeit I suspect most grown-ups celebrate it on their own behalf. On this single day we like to forget our own insignificance. Well, to tell the truth, some tend to forget it all the time. Other than that, it's been a fine day thus far.

      It would appear that not only was U.S. defence minister (or 'secretary', as they prefer to put it) Donald Rumsfeld informed of the atrocities committed in the Abu Grahib prison. If the award-winning  urlLink  New Yorker   journalist Seymour M. Hersh's  urlLink report today  holds any truth at all, he even  instructed  U.S. military personnel to carry them out. Naturally, this puts the whole story into an entirely different light. It is quite inconceivable that the Pentagon - and the minister of defence himself - kept information on the crimes committed in Abu Grahib to themselves, and that U.S. president George W. Bush was unaware of the Pentagon policy-making.  I would be lying if I claimed to be shocked by these news, but I can say this: following the further proceedings in Washington D.C. is going to be most interesting.

       urlLink   Business and culture don't always go together well, or at least; you don't have to be a scholar to be a good businessman, which I believe to be proven true in several cases. I suspect on the contrary. Besides, combining the two  would  be slightly incongruous. For instance, I recently overheard a couple of colleagues discussing minor problems in the Danish market, to which I simply enquired if something was rotten in the state of Denmark. The response, a number of dumbfounded faces, had me slightly flabbergasted. Obviously, my otherwise proficient friends possess a number of holes in their respective Shakespearean departments. As usual, exchanged glances more than indicated that Mr. Petterson was at it with his confused ramblings again. Well, I can live with that, and clearly, they weren't altogether uncomfortable with it either.  All the same, the already mentioned suspicion was confirmed. There's no connection whatsoever between enhanced literacy (if indeed basic knowledge of Shakespeare's work qualifies for the term) and commercial aptitude. At the very least, such a connection is not required. Still, I must say it had me taken aback a bit. We're talking upper level executives, here. Nevertheless, we all have our individual qualities, and they're equally admirable, in their own ways. There is comfort in that.  The point is that the entire episode only goes to prove that I am a first rate rambler, as the incident merely sprung to mind with respect to a completely different Danish prince (other than Hamlet, that is), who's  urlLink marrying  on this very day. Happy returns to friends and colleagues in Denmark, who are celebrating the joyous occasion as we speak - if that is what we do.

      During these two last days, another 23 Palestinians were killed, whereas 11 Israeli soldiers suffered the same fate, and there's really no end to the cruelties taking place in the Middle East.  I know this isn't exactly the PC thing to say, but really; he who expects the world community to find a solution to the regional crisis, is both badly misinformed and mistaken. The Temple mount is just as important to the Palestinians as it is to the Israelis. It is in other words imperative that both parties give up their religions in order to bring about peace to the Middle East - and we all know how realistic that is, don't we.  I'm not saying that the world leaders' efforts for peace aren't commendable, but they're hopelessly futile all the same. There's little else for the rest of us to do than to watch the Moslems and the Jews exterminate one-another day by day. With a little luck, statistics will show that more Palestinians and Israelis are born than killed, which of course is only good for prolonging the conflict considerably.  Of course this is my personal view on the matter, which is not to say that I'm dead against peace on earth and all that. But sometimes it helps to be realistic. I find that to be a most effective cure against the inevitable disappointments following (too) high expectations.

      Originally I intended "Say What?" (which is the blog's current title) primarily to be a Norwegian spoken - or at least written - blog. But seeing as Blogger is something of a global community, and since the world wide web after all is just that (world-wide, that is), one can hardly expect to reach an audience at all by means of a narrow language, such as my own. Hence the above mentioned change of heart. Future postings are therefore likely to appear in English. I'm sorry for the apparent lingual indecision, but then again; it's not as if the blog is read by anyone but the author himself.

       We didn't get to see BBC reporter David Dimbleby's Bill Clinton exclusive until a couple of days ago in these parts and really, it wasn't hard to agree with the ex-president's accusations directed at the collective press corps, Dimbleby included, criticising the excessive focus on the Lewinsky affair, even today, and rightfully so. More than half of Dimbleby's interview orbited around the subject, which really isn't fair, considering Clinton's book summed up the entire two-period presidency.  One of  numerous  things separating Willian Jefferson Clinton from the U.S. president of today, I think, is his regret over the lack of response related to the Rwandan genocide. He in fact declared that to be his greatest regret altogether. Which is something I believe George W. Bush jr. would've prioritised quite differently.  It's irritating though, to see how we all blame America for not fixing everything going wrong in this world. The responsibility is after all the global society's collectively. Then again, when a nation assumes the role of world police, criticism is inevitable. That, and with what right can a nation take on such a role? Sorry about the digression.  The overall impression of Bill Clinton A.D. 2004, is that of a repenting man, distinguished by regrets galore, but there's no getting away from the simple fact that he contributed to stability in the world at large, as opposed to his successor. The domestic achievements too stand out, especially with regards to social reforms, of course. If you ask me; Lewinsky or no Lewinsky, Bill Clinton remains one of America's best presidents ever.  As for regrets, we all have them. At least I know I do.  View the BBC programme in its entirety, or its transcript, on  urlLink this page .

      A Hungarian medical study made public yesterday, and formally presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference in Berlin today, has concluded that heavy users of mobile phones have sperm counts that are up to 30 percent lower than that of those who do not have or use mobiles at all. Their findings show that not only does using the phone affect a man's sperm and the motility of the sperm, but simply having it switched on in a pocket is enough to do damage, The Guardian reported yesterday.  Generally I trust no medical findings, however scientifically founded, unless corroborated by more serious documentation in  urlLink Clinical Evidence  or  urlLink The Cochrane Library . Having said that, I'm not entirely sure if such corroboration would make me stop carrying the mobile in the pocket. After all, I have already begot three mini Pettersons [of whom two are no longer so mini]. In case my mobile hasn't yet done its job, reproduction still requires a minimum of intercourse. How's that for safeguarding?  That aside, it would appear that my scepticism towards the Hungarian study is shared by scientists, who object that the study is small, and that its findings do not sit well with the bulk evidence so far on the health hazards of mobile phones.  urlLink Evidence Based Medicine  rules big time, baby [the child with acute otitis media finding behind latter link, was originally mine, by the way. The finding that is, not the child.].  Whatever the case, my mobile stays put.   More on  urlLink EBM

       As most people must've noticed by now, the American occupation forces "handed back" power to the marionette government today, rendering Mister Iyad Allawi interim PM, two days ahead of schedule.  According to the BBC's world affair editor John Simpson, the hastened handover was "[...] a clever tactical move that wrong-footed the Iraqi resistance," but he swiftly added that it actually underlines the occupation force's big failure - its inability to stop the violence.  It'll be interesting to see how the marionette cabinet is received by the Iraqi people. I expect most Norwegians will understand reluctance on behalf of the Iraqis. We too had such a government some 60 years ago, headed by a certain  urlLink Mister Quisling  [U.S. administrator Paul Bremer would play the role of  urlLink Reichskommisar Joseph Terboven ]. Will the Iraqis hold mister Allawi in a different regard?  The ongoing insurgence is likely to continue until the Iraqis are granted  really  free elections, with no foreign interference whatsoever, even if the Baath Party [or their successors] end up winning. A U.S. approval of such an outcome, is highly unlikely. I look forward to see how anti-democratic measures in the name of democracy are explained. Should it come to that.

       I've touched on the subject of  urlLink language  already, and gone into the tedious details of my fascination for it. How can you not be fascinated by language and its intricacy? Words are a key factor in all communication, and in order to fully understand their meaning, you'll need firsthand knowledge of some etymological basics. Take "beguile" as an example. According to  urlLink Merriam-Webster , the word has these four relatively different meanings:   1 : to lead by deception 2 :  HOODWINK  3 : to while away especially by some agreeable occupation;  also  :  DIVERT  2 4 : to engage the interest of by or as if by guile  intransitive senses  : to deceive by wiles Mainly supported by  urlLink Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary , which offers these interpretations:    1 ~ sb (into doing sth)  to trick sb into doing sth, especially by being nice to them:  She beguiled them into believing her version of events.   2  to attract or interest sb:  He was beguiled by her beauty. The tapestries continue to beguile all those who visit the cathedral.   3  to make time pass pleasantly by doing sth enjoyable:  They sang songs to beguile the long winter evenings  Anyone could call him- or herself a beguiler, intending to deceive or seduce, while officially claiming to do nothing but passing time in a pleasant manner, and in neither case being entirely untrue to the etymology. You won't pass for any of the afore mentioned, only because they're synonyms. There's the matter of conduct too. In this context a case of lingual misconduct.

      You thought you'd seen it all, didn't you, of man's ability to commit cruelty to one-another. I fear that you ain't seen nuffin' yet, and that gradually we deteriorate into a breed so used to our own atrocities, that beheadings end up as compulsory items on the daily agenda.  La decapitation du jour , so to speak. At least I think it's fair to say that we're no longer shocked by the monstrosities surrounding us on a more or less daily basis.  I'm sorry, but I see little cause for optimism on behalf of the collective humanity. Alas, the word "humane", in a contemporary context, is synonymous with "cruel". What's more, I don't think we've really noticed. A couple of Americans recently lost their heads [not trying to pull puns here], a South Korean this week and who knows; a couple of Turks in a day or two. So what?  Of course you could argue that our moral standards haven't deteriorated at all. On the contrary, we've regained the moral code of ancient times, asserting our right to claim an eye for an eye and so forth. The only deterioration taking place, is the decreasing support of the misguided[?] 20th century belief in humane ways. Be that as it may. Indisputably, most of us are products of just that century, and thus coloured by the era's standards.  It isn't easy to put into words what it is that I'm really getting at here, but I suppose this isn't too far off:  In order to stay sane we have to observe a certain callousness, which in its turn is bordering on insanity by 20th century standards. In other words, we need to go a little crazy for the sake of our sanity, meaning our sanity equals yesterday's  in sanity. Being a 20th century guy, marked by the standards of that time, I'm destined to deem us collectively stark raving mad, which is exactly what I do, I suppose.  In the middle of it all, I'm slightly confused by my own duality in these matters. On one hand I'm engaged in  urlLink hand-to-hand combat  and other, more traditional military disciplines, whereas I on the other despise the eventual outcome of many an armed operation. Of course I want to defend my country and the western way of life! After all, we  are  the good guys, right? Well, that's just where I seem to falter, as I am not altogether convinced that we are.  Could it just be that we're all entirely depraved? I'd say chances are good we are. And we've only just begun.

       If you consider going to Scandinavia for the summer, I'd recommend you steer clear of Norwegian shores. It's been pouring cats and dogs for quite some time, even though the calendar reads late June. Curiously enough, weather conditions have been fairly decent in my hometown,  urlLink Bergen , infamous for its heavy rains, whereas  urlLink Oslo 's been like mid-October. Having one's umbrella assaulted by chestnuts and rain rouse fond recollections, mind you, except it isn't what you'd expect of June. Not that we're experiencing chestnut bombardment, exactly.  Should you however find the weather to be of little or no relevance, I wouldn't hesitate to advocate a visit to our somewhat savage and dramatic sceneries, but I'd leave the swimwear at home if I were you. Which is a crying shame, of course. I was rather looking forward to introduce our 15 months old daughter to the pleasures of outdoor bathing, but chances are slim, in the foreseeable future, at least.  It's tempting to turn to quotes again. Ralph Waldo Emerson this time:    Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air...   If you really must know, I believe we're in for a lot of drinking.

        I'm afraid I am something of a sucker for language, even if it doesn't exactly show here, but I  do  write and speak my native tongue fairly fluently, which can be quite a challenge, as we actually have two official languages - albeit with a plethora of similarities.  That aside, my fascination for language is immense, which explains my affiliation with the  urlLink Grammar Avengers  [I'll leave the knitting to them]. According to  urlLink Laurie Anderson , of whom I used to be a great fan in ancient times [back in the 80s],  urlLink language is a virus . I may just be infected, but I really don't remember much of the German or the French and the Spanish I took a quarter of a century ago. It is amazing though, how quickly and with what ease you regain command of a second, a third or even a fourth foreign language, if given a few days' intensive practise. It's also funny how certain phrases linger, for various reasons. For instance I can't seem to forget Antoine de Saint-Exupery's  "C'est tout à fait comme ça que je le voulais!"  from  urlLink Le petit prince , ringing in my head in an almost childlike voice. From what I gather, I'm not the only one stuck with the phrase, but I suspect for different reasons, if any.  What really fascinates me about language though, is the intricacy with which it can be adorned - allowing for subtleties beyond range of people whose lack of comprehension is for the best. We wouldn't want to spread the virus, would we? We're far too considerate for that. After all, the important thing about language is to make oneself understood, which is my only ambition, but it wouldn't hurt if we stuck to standards, as our surroundings' conception very much relies on just that. That said, I'm beginning to wonder what prompted me to post this in the first place.

      It took a good couple of days to recover from last weekend's exercise. Well, I'm not entirely up to snuff, but I'm getting there. The Home Guard of today isn't what it used to be. In the olden days we used to practise good old infantry disciplines, but it seems that nowadays counter terrorism and supporting the police in major emergencies, are our main objectives. That being the case, the need to exercise hand-to-hand combat has arisen, as use of weapons is an improbable alternative connected with the handling of civilians.  Luckily my opponent was, and still is, Norway's number three wrestler [and no, not the WWF kind], leaving yours truly severely bruised and with a sprained hand. Well, the latter as a result of dragging six fellow soldiers with me in a two metre's plunge, all landing on top of me, whereof two on my face, would you believe it.  We did however get to experience some high tech infantry warfare, with sensor-equipped vests and helmets and built-in GPS, allowing the local warlords to monitor our positions and life support from a nearby mobile theatre. I got killed more times than I care to remember, though. Which was a bit of a revelation, to be honest.  If nothing else, at least you know what kept me from blogging since my return on Sunday night. I've been more than busy licking my wounds. Tough guy, huh?

        I'm off for a brief military exercise this weekend, which means I'm not very likely to be blogging, or tending to other private affairs, for that matter.  It's a three-day exercise only, with the Home Guard [National Guard, to those more familiar with that term]. "Let the Swedes come - if they want a piece of this," he said, referring to above picture. My great-great-grandfather was a Swede, by the way [hence the Swedish sounding last name]. How's that for high treason? Not that it really matters.  In saying that I won't be able to blog while in the woods fighting fictitious enemies, I'm less than 100 percent honest. If anything happens worth mentioning, there's always mobile email, which could come in handy, should I feel the urge to post a little something amid the martial hullabaloo. Fascinating, isn't it?

       According to U.S. president George W. Bush junior, the United States of America is a  urlLink safer place , thanks to the Iraqi ex-president Saddam Hussein's incarceration. That is an interesting declaration, practically coinciding with the commission investigating the 11 September attack's conclusion yesterday, that there's  urlLink no evidence  of an al Qaeda/Iraq cooperation.  For how long are the Americans going to allow this man to carry on? You have to admire the American loyalty though. The president is the president, whether you approve of his politics or not. If he's re-elected however, there's plenty of cause for concern. I have to add though, that fairly recent comments from American visitors to this blog, inspire a certain hope for the future:    urlLink No arguments

        I've been meaning to take up bicycle-riding again, to and fro work, that is. At least I could really use the exercise. Meanwhile I take the underground, which means I'm in the office no more than ten to fifteen minutes after leaving home.  Usually the ride is an unadventurous affair, but today was a little different, as the female driver took care of the entertainment, albeit I doubt it was on purpose. She announced the stations in the sexiest conceivable manner, or so she must've thought. I'm convinced now that she was having a fairly intense sexual experience. There was actually a moment there, when I feared for our overall safety, and in honesty I wondered if maybe the poor woman happened to be stark nikkid too. She most certainly sounded it.  Well maybe that's just what driving the underground must be like. God only knows what all that in and out of tunnels does to an imaginative mind. Must be the summer. Anyway, it makes you wonder if maybe a change of career is in place, doesn't it?  I think I'd better reconsider taking up biking.

      I was suddenly aware of the fact that I haven't offered an explanation for calling the web log "Say what?", neither for the scarce visitors nor for myself. Which is quite understandable, when I think about it. Mostly due to the absolute lack of reasonable explanations, except for the fact that a blog name was a prerequisite, which is something I wasn't entirely prepared for. My solution was to pick the first name or phrase that sprung to mind. On an unconscious level I must've assumed [if you do that on that level] that most visitors, insofar that they indeed exist, would ask themselves what on earth it is that I'm going on about. Which in my own opinion is a more than reasonable question.  Seeing as the blog in my view ought to be devoid of a name altogether, "Say what?" isn't at all such a terrible alternative. Chances are you will find its content full of self-contradictions, which shouldn't come as a surprise, as I'm inclined to refuse letting what depressions I may or may not have ruin my cheerfulness - and quite predisposed to spend time undoing the undone, Justin Case.  In other words, there's really no reason why the blog should be called what it's actually called. Then again, I suppose that goes for a lot of things in life at large.  *)  Attributed to  urlLink Friedrich Nietzsche     Subsequent addition:  How could I possibly fall for that old mistake? Quoting Nietzsche, Proust and Kant is a quality I normally ascribe to pretentious pre-graduate students and pseudo-intellectuals [alternatively intellectuals with a pompous ego] - and the likes of them. As for me, I'm just a simple guy who really doesn't know what posessed him.

        Thank heaven for the early morning kiddyshow. Here we go again. Ten to 15 years ago I used to praise the existence of the TV channels' timely cartoons on early weekend mornings. I ended up quite an expert on a host of series aimed at children in my time, and now we're at it again.  Our precious little princess wakes up in the early hours. Since  urlLink domestic chores  fall under my jurisdiction, I don't get to sleep in during weekends. The upside of that of course, is that I get to see a lot of cartoons. If I happened to be a cartoon buff, that is, which I'm not. Just now the Teletubbies were on, which suites our 14 months old daughter just fine. But wasn't there a lot of controversy related to the series some time ago? Something to do with homosexuality, I seem to remember. So I did a little googling, and presto. It would appear that the series stirred  urlLink a lot of fuss  around  le fin de siècle , especially in America, of course.  Allegedly, Tinky Winky's sexual preferences were subject to an endless discussion over TV role models for children. As I recall, my two sons used to watch it back in the nineties. I'll await the series' impact on them with great expectation.

      I always feel bad about skipping blog entries for a day or two, but I feel there hasn't been much going on in the world worthy of my attention. This isn't one of them overly personal blogs, you see: Sharing one's innermost thoughts and considerations isn't for me, which is also why I restrict all postings to the superficial aspects of life.  In claiming that there's not much interesting going on, I don't mean to imply that to be the objective truth [as if truths could ever be objective], but I belong to those who aren't easily impressed or impassioned. In truth, my eyebrows simply don't get an awful lot of exercise. I suppose it's very much due to the fact that I believe everything, and I do mean  everything , to be possible - which is why I'm never surprised to find that it actually is, if that makes any sense at all.  Insofar that I offer a rare glimpse of the most personal thoughts, they're on a very general and universal level. In other words; please do not expect remarks on subjects other than the utmost quick and casual.  Apart from that, the current lives of a couple of reality series contestants, seem to occupy the tabloid front pages hereabouts today. Which may explain this blog's mode of present idleness.

        There's an utterly boring debate going on in Norway today, even on primetime TV. It would appear that our prime minister [who is, by the way, a man of the cloth] is invited to participate in a multibillionaire couple's wedding this weekend, to most people's complete astonishment, it would seem.  The chief objection seems to be the mixing of financial and political powers and, obviously, the influence the former imposes on the latter.  One should think that I wouldn't find the subject worth blogging over if I didn't give it a thought, and honestly, I don't. What worries me though, is the overwhelming attention drawn to the matter. Should you however want my two pennies worth, I think it's only natural that our PM attends the wedding of two of those whose positions influence on most people's everyday lives. Then again, what do I know?  Norway's leading broadsheet, Aftenposten, has a section called   urlLink Only in Norway  , with no references to the case. Earth to Aftenposten, do you read me?

       Faulty punctuations are widely spread, and I'm no exception to that rule, but there are erroneous punctuations and then there are erroneous punctuations. One would expect people to run a more thorough proofreading when there's a lot of money at risk.  For instance, I came across this car today. The picture's taken with my  urlLink mobile phone camera , which is really a sorry excuse for a camera, as you will see from the result. That aside, the inscription along the side of the VW Beetle read:    Sorry cash There's a new king in town   My initial reaction was "what in the world is sorry cash," although I almost instantly realised there's a comma missing. Obviously, the car is part of an advertising campaign for a credit card of sorts. Of course, we're used to that kind of mistakes, but there's no denying that the misinterpretations are numerous. A handful of sorry cash, anyone?

       Anders, my oldest son just called to say that he received a straight A on his oral social science exam this morning. You can imagine the pride that I feel at this moment. Practically about to burst, actually. Which is probably why I irrationally enough go on boasting about it on the very worldwide web, too.  You could say that there's really nothing special about straight As. What triggered my exaltation, I take it, is that social science is a subject very close to my own heart, one that I used to excel in myself at his age, if I may humbly say so. And honestly, ascertaining that your own kids seem to value your favourite subjects, really is something special. He has even applied for a media and communications education. How's that for falling in the immediate apple tree surroundings?  Be that as it may. This calls for a minor celebration.

         Seeing oneself from untraditional angles may come as a shock to the unprepared. I was aware of the increasingly decreasing hair growth, but honestly had no idea it was this bad. I am the only coloured guy, as it were, in the picture. In case you wondered.   I used to look forward to growing older, and have always anticipated the coming of age with the greatest of expectations, but to be perfectly honest, I can't say that I care much for it anymore - as for anything else, for that matter. Nowadays, the only reaction I seem able to mobilise in response to the all the more visible signs of old age, is shock and utter disbelief, such as is the case with respect to the above photograph.  Of course I was aware of the increasingly visible crown, but I truthfully had no idea that it was this advanced. I wear it with pride, though.  Quod erat demonstrandum.

       The news of ex-president Ronald Reagan's death yesterday didn't come as a surprise. As we all know, it had been expected for several weeks, since Nancy Reagan's announcement on the former president's deteriorated health condition. There's a lot to be said about electing an actor and cowboy for president of one of the most powerful nations of the world, but that aside, Ronald Reagan managed to leave a lasting impression, leading the cold war on the  evil empire , and responsible for the implementation of Reaganomics [although I suspect former OMB** chief economist Arthur Laffer was the real culprit].  He will also be remembered as one of the presidential club's true cowboys, and how becoming a cowboy to ride into the sunset, or in his own words,  'I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life,'  as he put it in a press release on 5 November 1994. It would be a lie to say that I'll miss him, but in many ways I truly miss the days of the cold war, when our adversaries were few and clearly identified. There was but one evil empire.   15 years after president Reagan's resignation, the Americans can once again take pride in a true Texan cowboy [for those of us who still remember LBJ]. If you think Ronald Reagan did and said the darnedest things, this one places him completely in the shade. President George W. Bush jr. is likely to go into history as one of the times' most interesting leaders. Although chances are he won't be unique in that respect:   As we know, president Reagan was governor of California for ages before taking on the presidency. So is governator Schwarzenegger, who most certainly aspires for higher tasks, but who is unfortunately inhibited by not being American by birth, which is a prerequisite for presidential status in the colonies. The mere fact that the Californians elected him for the highest office in the state however, more than indicates that the United States has made a turn - away from political and diplomatic skills, towards general popularity, based on altogether different values.   But who am I to criticise? We even have our own cowboy acting as PM, no less. Kjell Magne Bondevik, who loves showing off his historically rural attire on festive occasions, wears a knife to go with the outfit. We simply call him Mag the Knife. Beat that, if you can.  *) I believe the  urlLink ELO  (The Electric Light Orchestra) used the word 'was', though. **)  urlLink The Office of Management and Budget ,  not  the Orchestral Manoeuvers in the Black [which is easily confused with the  urlLink OMD ]   Further details:   urlLink CNN's Reagan Special

        It's anniversary time again. 60 years ago today 23,500 paratroopers, 7000 naval vessels, 156,000 infantry soldiers, 5400 fighter planes and 3000 bombers invaded the shores of Normandy, in what was referred to as Operation Overlord, or D-Day, if you will. Thus creating a turning point of WWII, which eventually lead to the allied victory almost a year later.  Apart from the final outcome, the day itself is the cause of great grief and lamentations, as the agonies and sufferings of 6 June were substantial, I suspect on both sides. Let's not forget about that amid the anniversary celebrations [approximately 637,000 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured during the battle].  Originally general Eisenhower planned to carry out the plans on 5 June already. Hadn't it been for Norwegian meteorologist Sverre Petterssen, who  urlLink gave advice to the contrary , the invasion may well have ended in total disaster. Some would maintain that 6 June and the following days were just that, all the same.  What  is  unquestionable, is that victory was a fact on 8 May the year after. Hereabouts we call it Liberation Day, as Norway was in fact occupied for the duration of the entire war, more or less. Well,  some  liberation day, I say. Am I making any sense at all? Thought not. Wether I do or not, I suppose congratulations are in place.   Further details:   urlLink CNN's D-Day Special

        For the last 30 years or so, or at least since my thirteenth birthday, at which point I received a book that left a lasting impression, I've been an avid admirer of Bauhaus, art deco, de Stijl and similar directions within the fields of architecture, photography and design [both graphically and in products], well actually even in the arts of theatre and film [hence my almost infinite admiration for German director Fritz Lang]. Of course one might ask what in heaven's name it has got to do in a blog, but in truth I could return to the subject over and over, and never ever let it wear me out.   What I suppose really fascinates me about Bauhaus, to stick to one of the above mentioned directions, is the simple fact that artists of the very earliest 20th century created works which easily could pass for creations of our most recent time. Not only that, but actually be mistaken for something quite avant-garde, even by today's standards. I don't know what it is, but maybe the more or less secret knowledge of the opposite is source of the many pleasures gained from revelling in the remnants of the long gone Bauhaus movement.  Just think about it, the Gill Sans and Futura typefaces both surfaced in the twenties, just like the movies Metropolis and the series of Doctor Mabuse. Bruno Matsson designed his timeless chairs in those days, as well as a host of other artists, who have left their mark on today's surroundings. Also, you have to appreciate Bang & Olufsen's efforts in order to preserve the Bauhaus legacy.  In sum, I think, it all adds up to the essence of recent European culture, which suits me just fine, seeing as I am such an incorrigible European [rather than a Norwegian - if even that]. We live in a late Bauhaus apartment building [built in 1938], which is situated in an authentic Bauhaus colony in the outskirts of central Oslo. The façade is a sad story, I'm sorry to say, but oh, the curves of the interior walls, the spacious rooms - and the unmistaken tubes running from ceiling to floor in the kitchen! You've just got to love it, albeit maintaining a bona fide functionalistic style with a year old daughter in the house, is an unachievable goal, I'm afraid. Once again I'm beginning to get incoherent. The quintessential thing being: go have a daydream in the  urlLink Bauhaus Archiv .

        Remember Nena? Yes,  that  Nena, mit ihre neun und neunzig Luftballons. I don't know, but back in the early eighties, I was a great fan of almost anything German, from  urlLink Spliff  (originally the Nina Hagen Band), through  urlLink Kraftwerk ,  urlLink Einstürzende Neubauten ,  urlLink Propaganda ,  urlLink DAF  (Deutsch-Amerikanische Freundschaft),  urlLink Kurt Weill  and even  urlLink Nena Kerner . I stumbled upon  urlLink  this site   by mere accidence just now. Make sure to check out the video. Charming, in its own way. Obviously a remix of sorts, or sampled, at the very least, by somebody called clan.drei and Bringmann & Kopetzki, who ever they may be. Clearly, I'm no longer updated on the German music scene.

       I couldn't possibly take up newspaper journalism again. Well, of course there's always a chance. You never know before you know and so on and so forth. It's all a paradox, naturally, since after all I love journalism as a craft, along with the feeling of staying on top of things that it undoubtedly provides, and the opportunity to actually make a difference is quite alluring, but... And that's just it; there are too many  buts  (you could add an extra t to that, and that too would hold a certain truth).  For one, should you ever contemplate entering a career in journalism, be prepared to mingle with society's absolute riff raff, not only among the occasional villains you may have to encounter, but in the very midst of your colleagues as well. Which shouldn't come as such a huge surprise, since it's more than reasonable to assume that those who seek the company of society's rabble, will have to possess a certain amount of riff-raffish qualities. In order to succeed, that is. Should you however feel that the description fits you to a tee, you really shouldn't hesitate considering journalism as a livelihood. As for me, there was just too much of just that. Of that, and a few other things, such as sensationalism and entertainment.  For there's no use concealing the fact that journalism today is all about single-copy sale and ratings. One could argue that the press does nothing but catering for its punters' needs, which is indisputably of vital importance for those who wish to maintain a certain level of circulation. Newspapers with any pride left however, will have to face the fate of the niche media. The rest of us are demoted to a life in newspapers that increasingly resemble the  urlLink News of the World  and  urlLink The National Enquirer . Or...  There's always the possibility of going into information, PR and corporate communications, which turned out to be my way out. Bear in mind though, that if you feel like a prostitute, whoring for the increasingly simpler crowds, you'll soon enough come to terms with the fact that corporate communications represents yet another step on the harlotry ladder. Even if it represents a way out of the media's populist vulgarisms, that is a factor you'll need to address. But mostly, we're all reasonably happy hookers.

        A group of  'concerned Norwegian citizens and organizations'  plan to put  urlLink an ad  in the Washington Post, expressing their 'views of the Norwegian people on the foreign policy of the present [American] administration' [use of quotation marks is no indicator of irony].   According to the concerned group, four out of five Norwegians are opposed to the war in Iraq, which I believe to be a fairly accurate estimate. Still, much as I agree, I fail to see how they can succeed in their effort to stop U.S. military operations in Iraq. If the American public only  barely  resembles the Norwegian, they're likely to join forces against foreign criticism. Same thing happened here, when the rest of the world opposed to Norwegian whaling, which inevitably lead to a massive national defence of the whaling industry - even among its previous opponents.

      I must be a terrible person and an appalling bigot. You may ask yourself why it took me so long to reach that conclusion, and I really don't know. But here it is:  On my way to work today, I strolled along the pavement, with a couple in front of me who were holding hands. I sincerely do not know how it came to be, but without forewarning of any kind  urlLink Mad TV 's  'Lowered expectations'  theme played back in my head. Surely, the couple in question were both slightly chubbier than your average overweight person, but all in all I think they made a perfect match, which probably goes for the Lowered expectations intro-couple too. I suppose there's a link there, somewhere, because honestly, I don't disapprove of said couple in any way. It's just... Well, that song kept playing in my head.  Apart from that, one of the Norwegian state channels does a rerun of old Mad TV episodes. I may be pubertal, but I try to catch up on them, whenever I can.

       As of today it is illegal to smoke in all Norwegian pubs, bars, restaurants and nightclubs, or anyplace serving food and beverages, for that matter. In a recent poll as many as 60 percent of the Norwegians were in favour of the ban, with no more than 20 percent opposing it, leaving the remaining 20 percents undecided.  Norway is, to the best of my knowledge, the second country to introduce a full ban like this on a global basis, following Ireland, who imposed the same kind on legislation a few months ago.  Elongated meals in a relaxed and inspired atmosphere, enhanced by inlaid cigarette breaks, are about to become distant, but nonetheless treasured memories. Oh well, smoke ban or not, they already were just that, I'm afraid.  Either way, It'll be interesting to observe the already hot-tempered manage the abstinence after a couple of jars. I suspect we're in for some lively action.

         For months on end there's been an awful lot of fuss about Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, but I have to tell you, I just don't understand what it's all about. Granted, the movie earned Moore a Palme d'Or in Cannes, which undoubtedly blew a few fuses among American Republicans, but surely, the Cannes Film Festival's jurors couldn't possibly be confused with popular opinion?  Be that as it may. In my own humble opinion, Michael Moore is little moore than a discredited agitator. Of course I share his views on several points, but anyone as biased as Michael Moore will have to accept being stripped of credibility, which is quite a shame, seeing as he certainly has a point or two. It's just that his sarcasm is a tad too obvious, I'd say downright embarrassingly so.   You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that Mister Moore would've profited on attacking the Democrats once in a while, too. If nothing else, he'd be perceived as balanced, which, I'm sorry to say, he's not.

       I'm a little embarrassed admitting to have read Michel Faber's   urlLink Under the Skin  , but as  urlLink already mentioned , the author was unknown territory up until just now, which is something, quite honestly, I wish he'd remain. But I suppose that's part of taking your chances with unknown [at least to me] writers. If you're an avid  urlLink PeTA  follower on the other hand, or a  urlLink vampire chronicle  devotee [or a regular reader of lady novels in general], there's a fair chance you might find  Under the Skin  to your liking.   &nbsp;  It's not like I'm ashamed to have read books obviously targeted at a predominantly female audience, far from it. To the contrary, I find that to give an interesting peep into the world of women, which can come in handy some times. Hadn't it been for the fact that novels approved by Oprah [not that I suspect this one ever was] tend to be embarrassingly predictable, plot-wise. On top of that, Michel Faber offends his readers' intellect severely while trying to open eyes by means of role-reversal. In  Under the Skin , Faber attempts to convince the reader of man's cruelty towards our four-legged friends, by putting unknown beasts in place of the humans, quite like in the Orwellian   urlLink Animal Farm  , only embroidered ad nauseam.

          My youngest son and I went to see   urlLink King Arthur   last night. A word of advise, if you haven't seen it yet: If you expect Camelot, ladies of Shalot and a lot of other lots [except for Sir Lancelot, who actually appeared as one of the main characters], I'm afraid you're in for a huge disappointment. There were few signs of the Excalibur, too, or of the lady of the lake, for that matter, and Merlin, poor man, is reduced to a peripheral extra.    The film will have it that King Arthur originally was a Roman centurion of sorts, who won the hearts of the Brits. All that aside, as movies go, this was a poor attempt at creating action and suspense. Elongated battle scenes don't do it for me, but went right home with my son, who quite liked the film&nbsp;[and who turned 13 last week, by the way]. Well he would, wouldn't he, being the LOTR fan that he is. He told me that Guinevere [ urlLink Keira Knightley ] bore a strong resemblance to  urlLink his stepmother  [my wife, that is], though. I hadn't paid much attention to the resemblance myself, but now that he's mentioned it, I have to admit that, apart from the age difference, there's more than just a little likeness, not only when it comes to looks. After all, my  significant other  [what  is  it with people's urge to use that description anyway?] is something of an amazon herself, if she puts her heart in it.     Apart from that, the moviemakers' respect for historical facts, is quite non-existent, Hollywood-style, but intentional or not, British Pict tribes of that time actually were matriarchal, with female warriors and all. I'd go for   urlLink Monty Python and the Holy Grail   any day, or the early 1980s   urlLink Excalibur  . Or how about   urlLink Arthur   [coincidentally made same year]?

          I've received a comment on my last post, which deserves more than just a brief answer. I'm afraid I made use of exaggeration, for argument's sake, so to speak. Having said that, where there's smoke, there usually is a fire - however hidden. A U.N. withdrawal of its original support of Israeli sovereignty, is of course neither desirable nor particularly realistic, but I have to admit that I frequently wish it wasn't so.    Please don't get me wrong. I'm not especially in favour of either party. In my opinion the Palestinians deserve the extreme terrorists among them just as little as the Israelis deserve their militant authorities, but if you give that a little thought, what I just wrote entails a significant difference. However undeserving, the people of Israel  elected  their warmongering government as an act of free will, whereas most Palestinians after all never asked for the terrorists in their midst. Which again is a bit of an overstatement. I covered the Israeli 2001 election from afar, and seem to remember that Ariel Sharon's victory was an extremely scant one. Still, I was quite taken aback and appalled as it became clear that general Sharon, commonly held responsible for the 1982  urlLink Sabra and Shatilla massacres , was to hold the highest office -&nbsp;if not constitutionally, then at least effectively -&nbsp;in the state of Israel. My personal astonishment, however, did not reflect on my news coverage. All the same, it would be fair to assume that approximately half of Israel's population is against the West Bank barrier, against the Israeli occupation altogether, for that matter.     I know that I'm over-simplifying a complex of a huge magnitude here. Then again, I'm a layman good as any, hence at liberty to do so. An innate consequence thereof, would also be to assume that the Mid-East conflict is unsolvable. We're talking religion here, basically two different ones, with worshippers who in neither case are likely to surrender their faith in order to bring about peace. In our zealous attempts at mediating between Palestinians and Israelis, we tend to forget just that. If peace is ever to be obtained, both parties will have to acknowledge each other's unlimited access to holy sites, such as Jerusalem's  urlLink Temple Mount . As both parties demand full possession of that and other sites of equal religious importance, the conflict remains infinitely unsolvable. Besides,&nbsp;both parties [and especially the Israelis] resent foreign interference. In sum, I'd say this is a perpetual conflict, which solution seems absolutely inexistent. Sadly. Which is why I'm afraid that world society is fighting windmills. At least in this case.

           A personal decree:  I'll bet that'll make 'em think twice. Photo:  urlLink LetterJames.de         According to a Reuters report, The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to demand that Israel obey a World Court ruling and tear down its West Bank barrier. The vote in the 191-nation assembly was 150-6, with ten abstentions.     As the United Nations acted as chief instrument in the creation of the Israeli state in 1948, I'd say it's only fair that the U.N. recalls its original resolution.

       Several attempts at developing artificial intelligence have been made over the years. My first experience with the phenomenon dates some seven years back, when I first got to know  urlLink A.L.I.C.E. , a robot with which you could [and still can] maintain a fairly&nbsp;coherent conversation.  &nbsp;  Among the latest additions to the online AI features, we find 20Q, a robot that has a go at what you're thinking of, which in my case was a rocking horse. I know, that wasn't very fair, but I really wanted to put that little fellow to the test. Here's how it went:  &nbsp;     Q: Is it Animal, Vegetable, Mineral, Other, or Unknown?  A: Vegetable  Q: Can it fit in an envelope?  A: No  Q: Is it usually green?  A: No  Q: Does it come from something larger?  A: Yes  Q: Is it small?  A: Partly  Q: Does it roll?  A: No  Q: Is it a common household object?  A: Sometimes  Q: Would you use it daily?  A: Sometimes  Q: Does it come from trees?  A: Usually  Q: Is it man made?  A: Yes  Q: Does it bring joy to people?  A: Sometimes  Q: Was it invented?  A: Probably  Q: Is it used during meals?  A: No  Q: Do most people use this daily?  A: No  Q: Do you use it in your home?  A: No  Q: Is it pleasurable?  A: Depends  Q: Is it tall?  A: No  Q: Does it come in different colours?  A: Sometimes  Q: Is it straight?  A: No  Q: I am guessing that it is a boomerang?  A: No  Q: Can it be painted?  A: Sometimes  Q: Is it larger than a microwave oven (or a bread box) ?  A: Yes  Q: Is it something you bring along?  A: Doubtful  Q: Is it considered valuable?  A: Depends  Q: Does it require specific knowledge to use it?  A: No  Q: Can it cheer you up?  A: Maybe  Q: Is it usually colourful?  A: Sometimes  Q: Is it heavy?  A: Doubtful  Q: I am guessing it is a piñata?  A: No  Q: I am guessing it is a picnic basket?  A: No   At this point the programme resigned, offering a number of alternative solutions, such as:    a bird house  a walking stick (stick for  walking)  a sand box  a railroad tie  a costume  a jigsaw puzzle  an igloo  tree bark  a crate  a tree stump  a bow (archery)  a traffic cone  a hole  a bird feeder  sawdust  a cape  garbage  a banner  a garden hose  a rucksack  a gumball machine  a wedding dress  a stadium  a parade  a cardboard box  a hammock  kindergarten  a monkey  driftwood  a carnival  a wigwam  a sun dial  a merry-go-round  manure  a lei (Hawaiian flower  necklace)  wallpaper  a kite          On some counts I'd have to say close, but no cigar. You have to give it credit for persistence, though. Plus I really mislead the poor bugger, by informing it that I'm 42 years of age, which is true, but the robot would be correct in assuming that a rocking horse is an irrelevant object in a 42-year old man's everyday life, at least as it was unaware of same man's family relations. Still, I've heard that it handles somewhat easier challenges quite nicely. Why don't you  urlLink give it a try ?

       I took a  urlLink personality disorder test  on the net today, resulting in a disappointingly low score, in fact no disorders whatsoever. I usually don't give in to online tests and quizzes, but this is one that I simply couldn't resist, for the mere hell of it, of course. It's not as if I consider the test scientifically justifiable, or its methodology valid, but I suppose it works as entertainment of sorts.     Having said that, I really  am  disappointed by the outcome. After all, I did submit the character weaknesses that I'm aware of, truly expecting them to render me slightly wacko, at the very least. With the lowest score on all counts, I'm tempted to give it a second try, exaggerating every feature in my disfavour, except that wouldn't be exactly fair either. I once had an extremely manipulative person labelling me manipulating, which is of course quite interesting, but hardly valid as input for a test. So what is a guy to do?     Being classified as a tad bananas, would in many ways suit the prospective bohemian in me just fine. In other words, I really didn't need this. One thing is to share information on one's mental condition, sharing tidings of&nbsp;one's intelligence quotient however, is quite absurd. Not that it's staggering, mind you. Although if it had been; all the more reason to keep quiet about it, of course.     I suppose I'll just have to accept that I possess a downright boring personality, and rest assured; I'm not trying to be ironic about this. An existence devoid of personal disorders seems way too ordinary to accept as representative of my own qualities. But there you are; all work and no play... Who knows what eventually comes out of it. We can only hope.   &nbsp;   Addendum:   The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced of the test's shortcomings. For one, keeping a personal blog for all to read, most certainly has to be a sign of severe narcissism. Even after a few days' appeasement, I have found it quite impossible to accept the outcome.

       I'm not about to take sides, I think I've done that on numerous occasions already, but I can't help wondering where U.S. politics and democracy, as it were, are heading. Don't most Americans' attitude towards the two candidates more than inspire cause for concern?    Here's what I'm getting at: From what I understand, those in favour of president Bush, are so for reasons I will never understand, but what worries me even more, is that a lot of those in favour of the Kerry/Edwards campaign, are so because they find John Kerry's candidacy inadequate, but at least, he's not George W. Bush junior. Now what can we deduce based on that?     I'd say it's fairly reasonable to&nbsp;assume that American democracy has reached a level of deep and profound crisis, finding itself quite&nbsp;incapable of&nbsp;mustering&nbsp;able candidates for the country's leading office. Yes, I do agree that just about any candidate would be better than Bush, but I'm not altogether convinced that Kerry constitutes that much of an improvement.     Then again, it's early days yet. What, me worry?

              Weather report:  Here's what things look like in these parts at present. Uplifting, innit?      In saying it's been pouring cats and dogs, I'm afraid I've exaggerated just a little. If I were to be completely honest, summer so far has been one distinguished by continuous showers, interrupted by the occasional glimpse of sun, or at least a rift in the clouds now and then. Today, on the other hand, we're having the proverbial deluge.   If I had any say at all, we'd be lounging idly in the Mediterranean somewhere [preferably Italy], and actually put the swimsuit we so optimistically bought for our little one to good use, but chances of that are really, really slim. Instead we're going to the in-laws for a week, after having the boys over for yet one.   Alright, so I've been&nbsp;a little embellishing in describing weather conditions of late, but to claim it's been the worst summer in ages, would be a fairly accurate assertion. For what it's worth, at least I'm not going back to work for a couple of weeks, although I really shouldn't take a vacation at all this summer, as I've imposed a magazine deadline on myself by the end of August, for which I could really use the two weeks I'm taking off.   But you know what they say about eating cakes and having them, too. Or whatever.

        That's just the way it is, kids. According to the airline  urlLink Norwegian , traffic figures increased by 84 percent compared to same month last year. Now listen to this:   The reason is more aircrafts, new destinations and an  increase in passenger figures  [sic!].   Well, waddayaknow... Traffic increase due to an increase in traffic. I take it Norwegian is reluctant to share the secret with their fellow commercial airlines. Also, I suspect this isn't Norwegian's own doing. As indicated in a previous post, it  is  summer, which normally means news desks across the country are crowded with interns and substitutes.

       Things were a lot easier before  urlLink the fall of the Berlin wall  on 9 November 1989. There were bad guys and then there were the good ones, and we all knew which were which. Rogue states? They may have been rogue, but they were either theirs or they were ours. Quite manageable, really.  For want of an  urlLink evil empire , we take solace in  urlLink the axis of evil . For let's face it; the human race is at a complete loss without any kind of outer threat. Our need of enemies seems innate. Shortly after World War II, and before we had quite come to terms with the existence of a cold war, the threat from outer space, from Mars, to be more specific, emerged. It's in us, simply. Seeing as the communist plot for world supremacy disintegrated in the aftermath of said wall's collapse, the need for a substitute was urgent. We didn't have to wait for long either. The dismantling of the Soviet Union inevitably made ground for the rogue states. I'm quite dumbfounded by the fact that we didn't see that coming. It was so obvious. In a polarised world both parties would have to close ranks, as a virtue of necessity.  There's been a lot of talk about globalisation over the last 15 years or so. One would expect that to call for a severe centralisation of global politics. Undoubtedly, attempts to that effect have been made, but in reality with quite the opposite result. First and foremost, what distinguishes the post cold war era, is an over-complex system of beliefs, causing myriads of regional and global adversaries to wage war on each other and, in some cases, on the world society as such.  I'm sorry to say that I find both the remnants of former Soviet Union and other parties answer to the rogue state description. Exactly what is Russia's president Putin up to? You have to admit that his  urlLink intervention  in Russia's leading oil company Yukos appears to be more than just a tad politically motivated.  Yukos' former CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky's imprisonment, since last November, and Russian authorities' takeover attempt seem provoked by his support of the political opposition. I'd like to think that it isn't so, but have a hard time accepting it.  What I'd like to know is this: Is the world at large willing to accept limitations on democracy and freedom of enterprise 15 years after the liberation[?] of Eastern Europe? Our intolerance of such limitations in third world countries, and willingness to use weapons as a solution, is quite moving. In the case of Russia however, there's little need of weaponry. Financial sanctions will do the trick. Except, we seem quite prepared to accept loss of freedom in the former Soviet Union. A remainder of the old balance of powers, perhaps?  If western leaders want a means to rectify their mistakes of late, they need not look any further. As for me, I was quite happy to accept that Russian everyday life was defined by the Central Committee and the Polit Bureau's five-year plans.  So am I utterly and profoundly schizophrenic, or slightly confused, at the best? I have to admit one might say so. If there's a name for my peers and myself, insofar that there are like-minded individuals out there, it would have to be  right-winged leftists . Which leaves myself my fiercest opponent. Go figure.

      What is it with bloggers and the repetitive use of certain phrases and words? I put it to you that a Google search for words such as "musings", "rants" and "ramblings" predominantly will result in web logs. A few examples:   urlLink Rants  [disregard the 10 - 20 first results, as they're presumably somewhat more professional]  urlLink Musings  [same thing here]  urlLink Ramblings  [again...]  I don't know what it is, even though I have to answer for my share of the above activities, albeit I tend to avoid using the words. Trailing as I may be, my sole ambition is to reach my sparse audience, whether it's found in Norway or in Spain, even if we know  urlLink where the rain in Spain stays  [oh yes, it's still pouring cats and dogs]. People are apt to flea the country these days, taking shelter from frequent homely showers under the Spanish sun.  I'm afraid that we're all slightly spoilt in that department, among others. We expect summers to be perfect, to be granted the utopian idea so eloquently put on display in Depeche Mode's ancient  Somebody , and to make a little fortune or two. Alas, we usually wake up to an altogether different reality.  In other words, I don't blame any of us for going off the hinges now and again, pouring our usual rants at any poor bastard crossing our paths. To those of you who just happened to cross mine; I beg your forgiveness.

      I believe I touched on how the press exulted following a young couple's  urlLink nude performance  during  The Cumshots'  concert in Kristiansand the other day.  According to a vacation substitute [I take it] in one of our leading business and finance newspapers,  the band up until recently lead a fairly anonymous existence, but all of a sudden Cumshots are on everybody's lips,  or something to that effect.  Apart from the fact that the band lead everything but an anonymous existence, the vacation substitute does have a point: The Cumshots have indeed been on everybody's lips for a couple of days. In order to justify the pun however, twisting the truth a little was imperative.  I don't know about you, but I personally feel that the subject calls for quite a graphic picture:     The Cumshots in concert, shot shortly before said couple's appearance.

      A young couple crashed the stage, undressed and copulated in front of a partly shocked, partly amused audience during a  urlLink Quart music festival  concert earlier tonight. Public reactions vary from profound disgust to mild delight.  Well, what did they expect from a band named  The Cumshots  [which by the way is a fairly popular band in these parts]? The cause is honourable enough though. The  urlLink couple in question  is shocked and appalled by world society's general indifference to the rainforest issue, and wanted to repay with something equally shocking. Apparently a successful enterprise.  It would appear that  urlLink sex is about to supersede music  as the festival's main theme. To quite a few people's enjoyment, no doubt.  Needless to say, the press is having a  urlLink field day .

       In reference to Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction, British prime minister Tony Blair today told a committee of senior MPs that he has " urlLink to accept we haven't found them and we may never find them ".  Now there's a huge surprise. I mean, why on earth should we believe the findings made by the Unmovic [UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission], headed by the respected Swedish diplomat  urlLink Hans Blix ?  Mister Blair's sole consolation regarding the WMD, is that "They could have been removed. They could have been hidden. They could have been destroyed." I'm afraid chances are they already were, prior to the British-American invasion, if ever in existence.  And what of the Iraqi children,  urlLink allegedly abused  at Abu Grahib and in Umm Qassr? According to the TV programme "Report Mainz" on German TV station ARD and  urlLink Der Spiegel  [ urlLink translated into English ], as many as 100 children, all the way down to the age of 12, have been subject to abusive treatment in American controlled detention facilities.  I'm a little reluctant to accept these allegations as true, based on the German documentary alone, but they're ostensibly supported by both the International Red Cross and UNICEF. If there's any truth to this at all, mister Blair's and mister Bush' resignations are welcomed, pending trials quite similar to the one mister Slobodan Milosevic is currently subjected to. Sorry, guys, but there's no getting away from that.   Late addition:     urlLink Norway protests child abuse in Iraq  [Aftenposten.no 6 July 2004]

      On second thought, I'm quite convinced that my last post wasn't entirely fair to the fair sex [it'll earn me quite a few hits from search engines, that one]. Then again, blurting out what's on your mind, preferably in the spur of the moment, is what blogging is all about, isn't it? This is by no means to say that I disavow last post's reasoning, far from it. But I owe it to my scarce readers and to myself to balance the conclusions I so hastily drew.  There can be no doubt as to the growing malice found in the female half of world's population, whereas men, the traditional bearers of malignant qualities, "improve" as a consequence of their approach towards female virtues. There's no denying it: according to ancient tradition, female virtues are generally considered good, whilst that of the men have been deemed violent and everything but benevolent. It's easy, in the light of the ongoing reversal of roles, to find women's development to be deteriorating, even as men seem to evolve in quite the opposite direction. According to traditional virtues, that is. But then, traditions aren't necessarily right, usually quite the reverse.  The interesting thing about the reversal of roles however, is that the phenomenon's not at all limited to the sexes. On the contrary, we see this taking place in all layers of genders, ethnicities and social levels:    Women position themselves in corporate life, turning against their former oppressors   Third world countries turn on the industrialised world, ranging from terrorism through to India's IT boom, making its contribution to western unemployment, by way of massive outsourcing   Les nouveau riches take a long awaited revenge on the old money, squeezing the good old guys out of boardrooms all over the place   Over the last decade or so, I've grown accustomed to throwing acid remarks at more or less any conceivable subject, but this I think beats everything, touching on a subject I normally wouldn't go into until after the night's 38th tequila shot or so. I used to look at things in a somewhat less sombre manner, but everything, like the reversal of roles, goes in cycles, I suppose. Over the same period of time, I've become used to regard humanity at large with a certain amount of contempt, including one's own good self, mind you.  Not unlike my homosexual conviction, I consider myself something of a full-fledged misanthrope, regarding the human race on a whole a noxious vermin. Saving the world and humanity is a bit like having your cake and eat it too, or rather, saving both the patient and the disease. Then again, like any culture of bacteria, we have means of protecting ourselves against medication.  Who to blame? I'd round up the usual suspects, principally lead by western capitalism, spreading like a plague, even to the darkest corners of the former Soviet Union. Again I'm theorising. To tell the truth, I think it's time I got back to real issues. Ramblings like these lead nowhere.

        Although I'm not attracted by or to men, never have been, I suppose it's only fair that I define myself as a homosexual by conviction, even if that sounds weird, coming from a non-practicing heterosexual, by definition.  For one, I sincerely consider the propagation of homosexuality an invaluable remedy against further growth of global over-population, which is after all an increasingly serious problem. I really mean that, despite the irrevocable fact that I won't ever be able to undergo the transition required in order to live up to that conviction. I really couldn't, even if I wanted to [which I do, though only by reason]. In spite of that limitation, homosexuals have my wholehearted support, and I'm not being sarcastic. I feel I had to add that, as afore argumentation would suit the homophobic to a tee.  Secondly, I've seen too many incompetent bitches come into existence in the aftermath of the promotion of women. I'll be careful not to generalise, since exceptions to that rule definitely exist, how few they may be. The overall impression though, is that a lot of women tend to believe that success in the corporate world provides a certain toughness, as that is what they think is the case among men. Also, I'm quite convinced that some women executives consider it necessary to discriminate men in order to counteract the historic discrimination of women. While claiming to oppose discrimination, modern days suffragettes in effect oppose discrimination against women alone, as women's liberation in their view equals suppression of men.  This may sound strange, coming from a man who officially [i.e. on behalf of his employers] has championed dissemination of female top executives and members of boards of directors. Well, what is a man to do? It is the flavour of the decade, and as such something I'm compelled to follow up in article after article printed in the human resources management magazine I edit on a regular basis, rendering me an accomplice to the militant feminists' quest for the suppression of the male species. Get this right though: I'm as little supportive of the discrimination of women as that of men, but I think I've made that clear, haven't I?  Finally, I've come to despise women's general opportunism and disloyal nature. I'm beginning to think that generated experiences have left me an approver of  urlLink August Strindberg 's heartfelt misogyny. One is almost tempted to support   urlLink Men for justice  , but just  almost . I suspect that the organisation harbours a wife batterer and a rapist or two [not that it intends to]. You have to give  urlLink these fine ladies  some credit though, for proving that there are exceptions to the afore mentioned rule. Although it  may  just be overdoing it a little.  So you see, in claiming that I wish I was able to convert to homosexuality, I'm everything but entirely dishonest. That's how I define  homosexual by conviction . Unfortunately, convictions are based on pure reason, whereas emotions are an altogether different matter. In that department I'm afraid I'm still incorrigibly heterosexual, although I keep asking myself why.

      I accidentally ran into a colleague the other day, a subsidiary CEO waiting for a luncheon appointment. No more than 30 seconds into the conversation, we were interrupted by this fellow asking for some small change. Both of us regretfully informed him that we were fresh out of cash, chiefly due to the simple fact that we use credit cards. He pointed to a nearby ATM, in the mutual understanding that he wasn't entirely serious about it, and then left on a friendly note. Only, he turned after a couple of yards and came back.  "Say, you're in the IT business, aren't you? Management or something," he asked, apparently referring to our executive-style appearances. There wasn't much use in denying it. It turns out that our newfound friend had been down and out, and on drugs, for the last decade or so, and wanted to know if we thought he had any chances at all, should he apply for a job, operating a switchboard or something along that line. We courteously told him that chances would be slim, based on those facts alone. I also mentioned something about the widespread prejudice in working life, but made sure to add that employers who see beyond a candidate's previous problems do exist. Which may have given the poor bastard false expectations. He'd been working for 15 years prior to the personal downfall, and truly seemed raring to go. Again we took leave, wishing the man the best of luck.  The colleague and I agreed that the poor guy didn't stand much chance of getting a job, and that every individual has its breaking point, which is a conclusion I once had good opportunity to draw from firsthand experience. That aside, Norway is something of a paradox in that respect. We're among the richest countries in the world, famous for our welfare system, and yet the number of beggars populating the capital's streets increases rapidly. To be completely honest, I can't remember having seen such amounts of drifters anywhere else in Europe. It is our nation's undisputed disgrace, and a matter our politicians should be utterly ashamed of still having on their hands. Instead they treat the most deprived among us like a breed of lepers, whose fate is to be shunned and driven from one block of the city to the other. A complete disgrace, as just mentioned. I put it to you that if the politicians in a small country like ours, with its immense recovery of oil generating vast amounts of money [we're wading in it], aren't even able to put a basic need like that right, then they're really not capable of fixing anything at all. Which is an opinion that I stand by 100 percent.  Our politicians would be well advised to observe [or remember] how even a prime minister is the potential abuser of alcohol or medical substances in the aftermath of a personal crisis. Personal tragedy isn't exclusively reserved the already down and out casts, if that's the cause of their total negligence. A better understanding of our collective vulnerability is in place, but I honestly have limited confidence in our politicians' intellectual capacity, even in that respect.  I'm deeply and profoundly ashamed of admitting my nationality.

      As we're not part of the world as such, crimes do not occur on Norwegian soil. We are of an altogether different breed, taking care of world peace and general goodness. In spite of the daily proof of the self-conception's deficiencies, we're just as astounded every time, likely to blame it on external forces, such as third world immigrants.  Three days ago, a Somali-Norwegian man  urlLink went off his rocker  on a tram in central Oslo, swinging his Rambo-knife at anyone within reach, resulting in one permanently down and four casualties - in the middle of the afternoon rush. Two days later, a young man was attacked by knife, too, but survived to describe the assailant as  urlLink Somali looking  [Sic!]. Now, I have to admit that I have a hard time discerning a Somalian from a Sudanese or an Ethiopian. Maybe it's just me.  One incident, and the Somalians [which is to say any African, as they do look quite alike, at least judging by the colour of their skin] are prone to commit fairly regular genocides within the borders of our impeccable kingdom. I noticed yesterday, as I rode the underground to work, how people cast suspicious glances at passengers of African descending. This is all very strange.  You have to remember that our country strongly opposed South African apartheid, only to find ourselves scowling suspiciously at potentially wild Zulu warriors in our immediate vicinity. I think it's fair to say  that  is as far as we've come. So who are we to ridicule a president who, in response to an attack by  Afghanistan  terrorists, decides to invade  Iraq ?  This is however just as far as I'm able to stay on topic. Please forgive me for straying. Do you know what they call a woman under the influence of both PMS and ESP? I'm not going to dignify you with an answer to that, as you already know it.  Bwahh... Oh well. I didn't realise the implications of that until after I'd finished the thought. The original answer, which, as already suggested, you already know, is:  A bitch who thinks she knows everything  [for those of you who do not fit the description].  And yes; I know there's quite a distance between  urlLink Somalia  and  urlLink Zululand . But it sounded ok, didn't it?

        One should think by now it's been established, way beyond doubt, that USA's president George W. Bush junior says the  urlLink damnedest things . On the other hand, a president doesn't have to be a bad one, simply because he goofs up practically every attempt to put messages across.  Have to  being the key phrase.  Still, one can hardly blame the president's unfortunate intercourse with words for his unpopularity throughout the world, which is something he earned by plain action.  What I don't get though, is the widespread support he enjoys from a vast amount of American voters. I've always known the Americans to be a proud and high-spirited nation, which makes it all the more baffling that they accept having the world's number one laughing stock as head of state. Unpopularity based on actions, is an altogether different thing, which probably explains the defiance. Or... Could it really be that most Americans simply don't see what's going on, a divine comedy, if ever there was one? Although I doubt Dante had something like this in mind.

       With one son headed for comprehensive school by the end of summer, and  urlLink another  for sixth form, a fairly educated guess would be that I'm mentally prepared for the granddad part, awaiting some 12 to 15 years down the line, which is very true. Although, by that time, my youngest one, the lovely Alida [see photograph] will have entered comprehensive school level, too, hopefully providing me with another set of grandchildren, in nearly 30 years from now. At which point I'll be 70 something,  imshallah , parenting since the age of 26. That's what remarrying is all about, isn't it? Well, it's a mental detour, something I just took in, contemplating where to begin, which should be here:  Our princess, born a mere 16 months ago, has already grown to a towering 83 centimetres, demonstrating an overwhelming vocabulary [well, I'd claim so in any event, wouldn't I?], staggering along at escalating speed and sturdiness. Needless to say, she's the apple of her father's eye. It's not like I'm such a firm believer in children's ability to re-invigorate mature parents, or rekindle the youthful spark, as it were, but they most certainly bring about new perspectives, and an adequate reason to keep planning ahead.  Having said that, I don't think continuing along this line of thoughts will do me any good, lest it'll render myself a babbling and sentimental  coocheecooer . But boy, is she sweet.

       Well aware of the soothing effect a week in the countryside can have on some people, I find the tribulations of such a life thoroughly stifling. Anything in excess of three days' absence of bright lights, big city, is bound to bring yours truly to his knees, gasping for air, screaming for mercy with every fibre of his being. In other words, I'm quite incapable of expressing how utterly relieved I am to breathe polluted air again. I really don't think I could live without endless torrents of anonymous strangers passing by. The mere thought of familiarity, as we usually see it in rural areas, is claustrophobic, no less.  So now you know. I'm one of those shallow types, who find proximity to nature's quietude, the petty-minded ways, local gossip, farming, fishing and craftsmanship so suffocating, I'm convinced that my lungs, or my brains, as it were, would've burst into microscopic fractals, hadn't it been for our safe return last night.  I suppose I'm much like the wild animals, whom even the most seasoned animal behaviourists find impossible to condition for urban life, only the other way around, of course. Which is not to say that I'm completely bereft of beastly qualities. For instance, I've found that howling at the moon is quite feasible, even in the midst of a movie-going crowd. By way of observation, that is.
