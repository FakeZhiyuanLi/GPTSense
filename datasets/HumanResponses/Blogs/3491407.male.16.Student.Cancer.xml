       Well I wasn't have a very good day with my mom, so i decided to go on msn.... however that was boaring. I was getting tired of my old design (blog) and richard kept telling me to switch, so i looked at his and to my surprise it was much nicer! So for now im using this black background but that could change in minutets! haha Other than that i hope the rest of the day goes a bit better!

       Well lately it seems as my weekends are more for relaxing than doing the things I can't normally do in the week. Oh well its not too bad, today I just cleaned a bit well alot acually, I feel like being nice the last few days, which is a good thing.  I talked to Richard last night for the first time in I think is almost a week. It was only for about 15seconds or so becuase I was on the other line. I'm not sure where he is or anything but he wanted my postle code?! haha he said something about his cell phone or something he was getting a new one or a new plan. lol oh well he'll prolly send me the bill it would be just like him! haha I know he was getting a cabin for himself for a week becuase he wanted a break from his grandma's husband. He says he gets very annouying but then again everyone seems annouying to richard!  Ok well I guess I'll just go enjoy the rest of the day, its going by fairly Quickly!

Well I'm not too sure on what i am going to do for the next two days, but seeing as I'm soo very tired tonight I think I'll just relax and not worry about ANYTHING!!   However I've just been very busy/lazy lately that would be why I havn't done anything with my website or anything but ya, I put a new song on so that always helps... and yah.

But since I'm done my work I'm just doing w/e.   I've also decided that I'm gonna apply for another job today! haha this is kinda funny acually. But I supose if I can make money then its worth it right...? (well more money than i already can get/find/have) lol   Incase you have noticed that my new blog page is missing a few things like my picture and so on. I am working on it I've just been a bit busy lately. Well acually no I havn't just lazy so I am planning on getting that on soon the only thing was I have to make it small so they will host it for me! EVEN tho I was already hosting it myself for them they just HAVE to make it soo stupidly confusing dont they! I gave them the URL for the pic from my website and suposidly its too big for them to store, which makes noo sence! oh well I should get around to that in a day or two!

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well yesterday was O.K. I mean it was REALLY good one out little "tour" with my grandma thats visiting, until of course my mom totaly went insane for no reason but ONLY something she brough on herself. She really isn't leaving a good impression.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I can settle this on my own but then again it might take a while the longest we've been very mad is 2 weeks then everything was settled to normal but it took about 6 months to "repair" HOWEVER this isnt even HALF as bad. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in GOOD news, I'm going to see Richards new house in Qualicum Beach today HA took them long enough. Oh well.
