      Hey, I just wanna be the first to hop on here and congratulate the cast and crew of  L.E.A.R.  on a boffo opening night show. We'll have to have someone come out with a digital camera and get some pics up here soon. Right from the opening "dance routine" to the heart-wrenching denouement, I felt like the bitch-goddess of punk herself had grabbed me by the back of the head and rubbed my face in her love-sweat. Congrats to Stu and Jesse and everyone involved.   Also: if you hurry to come check out the show, you can still get one of the unique, commemorative T's that were made, with all your favorite  L.E.A.R.  characters represented.  DH

      Since that initial press release I sent to David, so handsomely published below, there have been some additions I would just like to make sure aren't left out, because they are awesome people and the shouldn't would be the same-and wouldn't be happening- without them. Gina Seghi will be playing Naomi, and the Burger Kings will be Aaron Begg (Dimitri), Alejandro Rios (Julian), Chris Struett (Kevin) and Jarrad Webster (Gabe).

      OK, so apparently everyone's wondering what the hell I was talking about with my post yesterday. oops! just a little joke courtesy of the  urlLink Bachelor .  Hi, I'm David, in charge of publicity and such for this production of LEAR. I first met Stuart Bousel when he starred in a show that I did in last year's  urlLink Fringe Fest . Soon after that, he produced one of his own plays,  Speak To Me , at Spanganga Gallery, and I helped with publicity and stage managing. I have to say it was a wonderful experience, and I learned many things about how to produce a show, from preparing the script to running rehearsals to directing a cast and keeping everyone's spirits up and involved all through the run.  I am a  urlLink poet , so everything having to do with theater is new and wonderful and strange to me, but I am fascinated with all the hard work that goes into every last detail and the magic of how that unfolds on stage.  LEAR has been no different, except that this time, Jesse Baldwin has brought his own energy and enthusiasm to the exuberance and irreverent humor of Stuart's script. Although I haven't been to any of the rehearsals so far, the initial read-through, at which I chipped in by reading for an absent  urlLink Burger King , had us all in stitches. It's hard to believe there's only a week to go before opening night.  So maybe I'll post something more later, but for now, I'm going to do the job I'm getting paid big bucks to do and post a little something about the play -- ticket information and show details far, far below, with a cute picture of the Cunning Stunts.  LOVE, EGOS, ALTERNATIVE ROCK (L.E.A.R.)  directed by Jesse Baldwin written by Stuart Bousel based on the short story “The Cunning Stunts” by Melissa Klepetar  Sometime in the mid to late nineties, Simone (Lisa Swanson) and Tim (Wylie Herman) are two young American kids in love, but sadly finding that lives lived in retail and rent control are sapping the fire out of their romance and eating up their potential as human beings. Simone decides to start a garage band with her friends, the ambitious and unscrupulous Naomi, the blithely apathetic Charlotte (Stephanie Young), and the sadly unmarketable Britney (Ellie Davis), and by some freak accident they are picked up and become overnight alternative rock sensations. If this all sounds too good to be true it’s because it is, and Simone soon discovers that she and her music are now at the mercy of the squabbling gay power couple who run the record label (Chris Kelly and Ryan Hayes), a maniacal nymphomaniac pop princess named Robin Swords (Amy Seimetz), a well-dressed but fairly talentless boy band more interested in scoring drugs and record contracts than making music. In the end Simone must decide not so much between success and integrity, but how she plans to cope with a world and an industry where that choice is never even given to her and her dreams might only really mean something to the boy she left behind to pursue them. Narrated by an ageing punk rock icon (B. Warden Lawlor) and a rabid fan (Margery Fairchild), the whole thing is done up VH1 “Behind the Music” style, with a mixture of dramatic scenes and interviews, but not one second of live music performance because hey, it’s never really about the music any more, right?   Brought to you by the creative team behind  Edward II ,  Speak To Me   and  Troijka , the show also features a soundtrack stitched together from the CDs of a myriad of local bands and performers, varying in sound and style from Jazz Quartets to one woman folk acts and Berkeley basement bands.

      Hello LEAR bloggers...  Chris Egli here....  "Tightrope Tango" and "Rock Star Parking" are the two songs I have in the LEAR soundtrack and I wrote both of these tunes within the past year or so.  Here is a little background on each...  I am a big fan of the noir genre and "Tightrope Tango" was, for the most part, inspired by my interest in old movies.  Story-wise the tune is about a classic femme fatale type and an obsessed Joe Nobody who really meets his match.  He would like to take some lessons but may soon discover that her dance card is full.  Watch that first step, Mac, it's a doozie...  "Rock Star Parking", however, was born out of far less cinematic circumstances.  A long time ago I went out to lunch with several coworkers and the person who was driving scored the best parking spot possible, right in front.  My friend Doug said, "Wow, rock star parking!"  Ever since then, whenever a high quality parking place is secured, I almost always at least think of the phrase the few times I don't happen to repeat it aloud. (it should be noted here that the band Sleater-Kinney, which has already been posted once on this blog, is on the record label, Kill Rock Stars)  One day I finally decided to use the phrase as the hook for a tune.  So, I wrote a song I thought a real, bona fide rock star could have written, circa 1987, and put a bit of a twist on it.  With what I can gather from the postings here, I think it will suit the tone of LEAR very well...  I consider myself more of a songwriter than a performer.  If you would like to find out more about my music just check out my site under the Music and Performance links on this page.  My wife and I will be at the performance on May 29th and on closing night.  Should be a great time....

      We're a  jazz band based in SF . Our song "Cal's Pals" is in the L.E.A.R. soundtrack. I wrote this tune in the mid-'90s, inspired by the music of Bay Area vibraphone player, the late Cal Tjader. I put in a favorite lick from Cal's tune  Mambo Mindoro  into my tune. In our tune it's the guitar/marimba lick at the end of the guitar solo section of the tune. Echo Beach has performed this tune dozens of times in the past 10 years and just last Sunday I was told at a gig that it's the favorite tune of some people who  buy our CD . This month (May 2004) has been the most surprising and amazing month in our band's 13-year history. Our music was used in a documentary, we are proud to be included in the L.E.A.R. soundtrack, and KGO Radio played our recording of A.C. Jobim's "Wave" last week. I will be attending L.E.A.R. with my wife Sharon on Friday 5/28. Shouts out to Bay Area musicians who are carrying on the great musical tradition here. - Blair Helsing, bandleader, Echo Beach

      So, what is the deal with L.E.A.R. and why is it more than just another hip one act play about chick bands, record producers, boy bands gone wild and teen super stars with not-so-secret secret lives?   Actually, I'm not sure that it is more than that, but I'd like to believe that beneath and between all the funny lines and satirical characters, outrageous situations and blithe social commentary, there is a bit of heart and truth, even if it doesn't add up to full fledged profundity. Call me sentimental but I've always believed that without a little meaning, entertainment is not only sort of worthless, but less entertaining too. For better or worse, I like to go to a movie or a play, or listen to music and see art, and have it transform me or teach me something or just give me a soundbite to mull over. I don't like to just consume art, I like to be affected by it; I want to be a better, wiser, more understanding person after the experience.  That said, there's no reason why we can't laugh while we learn, and I think the best way to engange someone's head and heart is through their sense of humor or their sense of empathy, and I think L.E.A.R. is full of opportunities for both. At the center of the mess of monologues and vignettes there is the story of Simone and Tim, which is the real relationship around which all the silliness of the music industry is woven, an absurd context for something ordinary but heartbreaking which is happening to these two young people who love each other but need to still prove themselves as individuals and discover who they are. It was important to me, draft after draft, that they not only really care for one another but that Simone, as the woman in the relationship, was the stronger and more proactive of the two, forcing Tim to rise to her level as opposed to in most plays and movies, where it seems to always be the opposite, and the woman either stays home and supports her man while he goes out hunting for fame and fortune, or only embarks on her own quest because she's supposed to raise herself to his standard. Which is not to say that I don't think Tim is a nice guy, because I think he is and I wrote him as sympathetic; as male leads go in my canon of works, Tim's actually among the more likeable, though he's also decidedly more simple. Essentially, he's a really nice guy who, like most nice and simple guys, doesn't know how to live up to his potential, both as an individual and as one half of a couple. The best thing about Tim is that he's willing to let Simone, in the end, draw out of him the best he has to offer, and conversely the best thing about Simone is that she does this for Tim, thus making it so that he has more or less done the same for. They give each other a reason to be good people, honest artists, and ultimately good halves of a pair, but the way they get there isn't an easy one, and it has to come through, in the beginning, going seperate ways and letting go of each other for a while. I think this is something a lot of people can relate to, myself included (especially these days, it seems), and I'd like to believe (despite the cynical elements of my nature), that the happy ending Tim and Simone get is something we all get, though the road there may be long and hard. I don't think it's impossible though, given a good foundation, enough time, and hearts that never give up.  In contrast, I think the relationship between Nikolai and Francisco is a potentially interesting exploration of an absurd relationship in the context of a real world- think of how much they effect all the other characters in the play, and yet are always much more stuck on their own drama than any of the artistic and business matters at hand. Simone, despite the angst over Tim, is still focused first and foremost on the band, where as once their relationship falls apart, Nikolai drops all pretense of being a legit record producer in order to get back at Francisco, and in the process not only helps bring about the destruction of the Cunning Stunts, but the Burger Kings as well, even as Francisco's personal motivations helps to launch the career of the even more selfishly motivated Naomi. The problem is, neither of these men have art at the top of their priority list, but they have the power to make or break artsist; and I'd like to say that wasn't pretty much how the real world works but most of us who have spent any amount of time trying to "make it" in pretty much any field of art know that there are all too many Nikolai's and Francisco's out there. If anything, I've been polite and affectionate in the creation of their characters, but despite giving them a happy ending it should be noted they don't give anyone else a happy ending: Tim and Simone have to strike out on their own at the end, and make it on their own terms. They get a happy ending not because they learn to succeed in the Nikolai and Francisco world, but because they recognize it for what it is, and realize they will be happier working outside it, even though that means sacrificing whatever it has to offer.  What it has to offer is the monumental but artistically empty success stories of Robin Swords and Naomi Finn, both of whom ostensibly represent the "wrong" in the play, but honestly, despite the "bitch" qualities to both, they aren't the villains. After all, as Robin freely admits, they wouldn't exist without the networks that create and support them, and they wouldn't act and climb the ladder as they do if they weren't being rewarded for it. Though its easy to see why we're not supposed to like Naomi, and why Robin is a laughable character at best and a kind of sinsiter one on another level, the fact is the much more lovable Francisco and Nikolai are really to blame for their existence, and it's important to recognize that beneath the charming gay boy veneer, these men are really in the business of making people over into monsters, and monsters they must become because that's the only way one can hope to survive in that world of constant exploitation and artistic compromise. When Francisco says to Naomi, "First I'm gonna fuck you, then I'm gonna cut you, then I'm gonna leave you for dead," it's funny because it's ridiculous; but when you recognize that he really does get off on this idea, it's also kind of scary. Likewise, there's something tragic about Nikolai propositioning Dimitri as a way to get back at Francisco's infidelity, but it's also kind of repulsive in the calculated way he does it, the ease with which he expects Dimitri to accept his advances, and the even more calculated manner in which Dimitri responds. That said, it's also plainly evident from the list of sexual acts they outline that Nikolai will be experiencing very little pleasure in this liason, but I'll readily admit I've always seen him as the more sympathetic of the pair.   The other characters just get farther and farther from that reality core of Tim and Simone. Phyllis and Malcolm are nice, but obviously she is mentally and emotionally unstable and he is too much of a deus ex machina to be taken seriously as anything more than a ludicrous allegorical figure (though people like him do exist in the art world as philanthropists and patrons, they are few and far between). What both represent is extreme ends of the music world that is the setting of the play- she the rabid fan, he the embittered star, she perpetually optomistic but needy, he constantly cynical but generous, she wrapped up in dreams and fantasies, he the manufacturer of celebrity myths and hooplah. Contrasted with this pair are Britney and Charlotte, so frighteningly normal and uninspired that it's absurd to suggest they make it through the two to three years of the Stunt's rise and fall- and yet the art world is full of people like these, there to do a job and collect a paycheck, somehow totally oblivious and/or apathetic to the passion plays and struggles of the Simones and Naomis that surround them. Even Britney's sympathy for Simone is the kind co-workers have for one another, which is not to say it's ingenuine though so much as it does seem to be relatively oblivious to who Simone is as a person let alone as an artist, and once Britney has passed on the problem for Malcolm to handle we never hear from her on the subject again. I don't think there is any better example of "casual aquaintance" than that. The other boys in the Burger Kings are equally as absurd- again, more involved in the very narrow world of their personal problems and gratification than in the larger world of art, personal integrity and spiritual fullfillment that Simone and Tim are dealing with.  The intellectually interesting thing about L.E.A.R. is how those abstract virtues are held up as the representatives of the real, as opposed to the absurd things in the play- the insatiable greed for money, fame, drugs, sex, etc. But that's because Simone's perspective dominates the story, even though she speaks to the audience less than any other character in the play. Still, it is her journey we are following, and since her values are more abstract, the more earthly, material greeds of the other characters are by nature absurd, and she reacts and cognates them as such. Ironically, and kind of sadly when you think about it, this also means that in the end she is the outsider, for while she may be, as Tim puts it, "the honest one," she is vastly outnumbered, and while Simone is our heroine she's not kidding when she says "I'm the foolish one," implying that to have something like artistic integrity and still desire achievement is akin to being a fool or idiot. When you are the only sane person amongst lunatics, it doesn't take long to begin to doubt that, but on the plus side Simone comes to realize that the reason why she needs Tim is because he can provide validation for who she is. On her own, she always has her integrity and the music she makes, but with Tim in her life she also has his love (and her love for him) to show for it- the integrity and music become more meaningful when he is there to share it and for all his failings and human fallibility (of which she is hardly bereft) he is the best compliment to who she is, more so once he realizes it is both his duty and a source of great  personal happiness for him to be so.   It is this descent into an absurd world, and passage back to the sane through the recognition of the need for virtues such as loyalty, honesty, love and tolerance, that give L.E.A.R. both it's undertones of "King Lear" esq tragedy, and also any emotional bite it might have. The happy ending has teeth because the best happy endings always do- because they come at the end of a journey that didn't always look like it was heading towards reconcilliations, understandings and new beginnings. The fact is, of course, most people sitting through L.E.A.R. are probably much more likely to just pay attention to the wacky antics and danceing boy band kids, with maybe a wistful sigh or two for Simone and Tim, but not much more thought than that. But as I wrote above, I always like to look for more in something, even the most frivilous entertainment, and since I'm sure I won't be the only guy who wants to find something to cure heartache in even the most unlikely of places, I thought it couldn't hurt to bury some treasure for anyone interested in looking for it. And that, more than anything, is what I'm all about in the end, because my heart is in this play and the complications of my life resonate with this story in even its most absurd and outlandish moments. Beneath the thoughts and the jokes there is something genuine here that I wrote years ago and set aside for later and now I'm here and have been discovering it all over again, just in time. So I'll take the hint and keep digging deeper, and maybe I'll get lucky and maybe "One Day I Will See Everything" too.

      L.E.A.R. began as a side project, which is a polite way of saying "joke." My college buddy, Melissa Klepetar, had come to visit me one New Year's while I was living in Tucson, Arizona and one night, just before the turn of the year (2000 into 2001, for those of you who want to know), when we were drunk and talking about the good old days of school, mixing it up with some run of the mill relationship gossip and twenty-something angst and ennui, I found myself launching the idea to turn a short story she had written, "The Cunning Stunts" into a stage play, and before I knew it we were sitting at my incredibley ancient IBM coming up with dialogue and characters and something resembling a story (the original work having been more of a list of funny song and album titles interwoved with third person narrative that detailed the a-typical rise and fall of a rock band composed of real life people we knew from school- Missy herself was the lead singer).   Well, before we got more than a few pages in, New Year's was upon us, more drinking to do and now cooking on top of that (I'm big into dinner parties, and whip up a mean bacon quiche) and then it was all about recovering from the festivities and moving on with life and work and so forth and for a month L.E.A.R. went unfinished while I was directing a production of Marlowe's EDWARD II (what turned out to be a pivitol production in my growth as an artist, no less). Shortly thereafter I moved into a new apartment, got cast in a production of PSYCHO BEACH PARTY that played for the entire spring, and had a summer theater season to plan, but somewhere in there I managed to finish off L.E.A.R., or at the very least, give it an ending, and having sent the first rough to Missy (who loved it) promptly forgot about it until one night when I decided to have a bunch of my friends come over and read the play, again just as a joke, which is a nice way to say I never thought I'd ever want to actually produce the piece.   But sometimes your work takes a turn you don't expect it to, and what you think is great no one gets and what you think is funny and cute suddenly bowls people over and while L.E.A.R. didn't actually bowl anyone over it did capture the imaginations and tickle the humor of several people, not the least of which was a talented, pretty Arizona actress named Cristina Ulloa, who read the role of Simone, loved her, and proceeded to never let me forget the play was worthy of more than dust collection in the bottom drawer of my desk. She did something even more important: she saved a copy of the play, and years later, when I found myself suddenly itching to read it again, she sent it to me, her only regret that it would be done in San Francisco, not Tucson, and she wouldn't be able to be in it (though interestingly enough, my friend Wylie Herman read the role of Tim at the original reading, and will be playing the part here in San Francisco). Jesse Baldwin and I were looking for a play to collaborate on here in the Bay Area and specifically something lighter than my three previous Bay Area productions, and with a relatively large cast since we had managed to get a hold of New Langton Arts, a fairly large performance space we wanted to be sure we could take the utmost advantage of- and fill. L.E.A.R. more or less fit the bill. Jesse liked the play and thought he could do something interesting with it, Chris Rader and Amy Seimetz, my collaborators from TROIJKA agreed (at the drop of a hat, I might add) to come add their magic, contracts were signed with the space and L.E.A.R. was on its way.   Next, I sat down to do revisions, taking the play from eighteen characters down to fourteen, (Ginger, the lesbian techie was axed, as was Elsa the music critic and two super models named Rachel and Inga), focusing the narrative and making it more of a love story and less of a VH1 Behind the Music documentary, though that is, essentially, what it is meant to be a satire of. The drummer, originally a guy named Bradley, became a woman named Britney, and though I love all of Missy's wacky song and album titles, I ended up cutting half of them as well because parts of the play still read too much like liner notes come to life. The central story of Tim and Simone, however, comes to the stage almost completely in tact from the first draft, which is good because it's the only thing the play has remotely resembling profundity, and it's also the part that is most my own- though Tim was named for the guy Missy was seeing when this all began back in December of 2000. But that central conflict of loveing someone and losing them because they or you (or both of you) are destined for something greater than an unqualified happy ending... well, that's the running theme of a lot of my work (what changes is my take on it), and I'll be damned if it's not basically one of the central issues of art in general, music in particular, and life as a whole. That said, I do believe that even the most impossible stories can sometimes have well-earned happy endings, and L.E.A.R. in particular has always been a fairy tale (as all stories about fame and fortune and rock stars have to be) and I think it remains thus, perhaps even more so in the draft that will finally make it to the stage.  So anyway, that's the story of L.E.A.R., for the most part. One girl's funny story (which really began because of a photograph of some of our friends that looked so much like the back of CD it was impossible not to come up with a fake band for them to be) which got turned into what we hope is one man's decently funny play. And no, no one sings, but then it was never really about the music anyway, right?
