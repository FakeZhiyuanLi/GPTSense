       I've realized that I have nothing witty to put in this entry or to complain about, so, since I am bored out of my mind, I will just be writing random things that either pop up in my head (scary thought, isn't it?) or that are happening irl.....                  ...   See how I'm not putting anything up??  It's all just kind of blank.  Wanna know why?  Because...nothing is happening, no one is on, and I'm just kind of ...brain-dead at the moment.  My fingers are typing all by themselves.  They could be typing something like "I'm a big buttmunch who loves to eat tissues and roll in pools of dirty slimy worms and things of the like," and I won't even know it.         O.O;         oh le sigh....I have nothing to do... damn...I even cleaned my room(s)....  Do you have any idea what that means??? IT MEANS I'M BORED!...  Steven's at camp.  No one other than one of the coffee addicts I met at camp and one of my former classmates is on... GR!      This just might be the stupidest Blog I've written for a long time.  I don't care though...because I'm in a stupid mood...   Remember??? Brain-dead for the moment...                     That's what's in my head...blank.

        "For the life of me I cannot remember   What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise   For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins   We were merely freshmen"   *sits tall and arrogantly* *sniffs with dignity*  Well, fine. See if I care. (It really is a good song, though....)         Why would someone be taking geometry and physics at the same time? I wonder.     You sound old...are you old?  I would love to be old...

      Mood=Very tired, and sore...  Okay, so, Dark definitely wasn't lying when she told me that she's very hyper at night. Not that I don't mind. Normally I am as well, but lately I haven't had much energy to do anything. I know why, it's just that I don't really want to think about it.  Anyway, she's still asleep. I'm going to go wake her up in about 15 minutes...That way we'll be able to do something before Dad comes and takes her to the Bookworm. I haven't decided what, though. I think we should watch Angel's Sanctuary... Just because it's here and it's a kick arse movie.  Last night in the car, on the ride home, we were listening to the Peek (spelling?)..and Pink's "Don't Let Me Get Me" came on. Now, most of the song is made to fit her, obviously. But I thought the chorus was fairly interesting, to say the least.  I'm a hazard to myself Don't let me get me I'm my own worst enemy It's bad when you annoy yourself So irritating Don't wanna be my friend no more I wanna be somebody else  Other than the double negative...those are some pretty deep seven lines, I think. I'm doing it again, though...I'm making everything about music. Not even music that I make a habit of listening to. Someday I'll write about something else...but at the moment, everything seems to be centered around music.  I have to clean my room when Dark leaves. If I had cleaned it earlier, I would have been able to go to the store with her today, but noooooo.  Anyway, I'm going to go wake her up in about five minutes, and it will take me that long to publish this and get to her room and blah blah blah, so I'll write more later...  Toodles.

       Mood=Tired  I don't know why I'm so tired. We got back from the mall about an hour ago...  Dark is very...very...very hyper... and it's nice to finally be around someone, especially someone that I can relate to.  Sooo, at the mall...  Well, I got the coolest new pair of shoes.  They're so pretty!  ^_^  And...well, I got Briar a her birthday present...        Dark's going around in random chat rooms and asking "Any gay males wanna chat?" ... *ahem*  Interesting...  She hasn't got any replies yet.  I'm beginning to wonder if that's because she's in a room called "Butches Unite" ...yes, that's what I want to talk to.  A butch homosexual man...*ponders*  Well, actually....      ANNNYway...      Lol, I like the "any" words...   Anyway   Anything   Anyone   Anybody   Anywhere (hehehehe...)      My arm itches.

       Mood=meh-ish..   Listening to: "Toxic" by that Britney girl... (don't ask why, I don't know)      It's times like these when I think I present the most danger to myself... I'm alone all day, craving for contact with people, but those who I talk with are never on this early...  they're lazy.  I try to tell them that they need to get off those horrible sleeping schedules for school...but they don't listen.  I'm in one of those moods where I really just want to be around someone, you know?  I don't really want to talk, or touch, or anything like that.  But I'm used to being around people at school...I think that's why.  I miss school a lot.      High school will be different though..most likely...  I don't want change.  Well, that's a lie.  That's one of the biggest lies I've ever told in my life.  I depend on change, everyone does in a way.  Triangles mean change.  I have one on my arm.  I can't remember, though, if the Hershey chocolate adds said if change was bad or good.  It would makes sense either way, I imagine.  So I guess I'm ready for high school.        I really don't want to be in the youngest grade, though.  I don't like being young.  I don't like being looked down on.  I don't like being blown off because apparently since I'm young, my ideas and problems have no significance to those who are all high and mighty...  I'm sorry...shouldn't have said that.  Oh well.  I don't really care.      I still hate my mood swings though.  I wish I could be like this, apathetic, all day, but I know that there's not a snowball's chance in Hell for that one.  I'm going to the "mall" today with Dark.  Hehe, that's what I call her.  I don't think she likes it...oh well.  Anyway, normally I hate shopping, but we're going to  be on our own!  Granted, we'll probably just spend the whole time in the bookstore...but hey...it's worth it.  Besides, I have to get new shoes for school.  I'm still debating, though...I don't know if I want the orange converse that I absolutely adore or a real type of tennyshoe (that's what I call them....I don't know of anyone else who pronounces that the way I do, so I decided to make my own spelling)...dear...look what the solitude has done to me!!  I'm talking about SHOES! ...What is the world coming to?      We might bump ends with Sam and Cori there too.  I haven't seen Cori since school let out...but I saw Sam at marching camp.  All the same, it's been a while, but they don't really get along with Dark, so I doubt we'll spend much time together if we do end up meeting.      Last night was very awkward.  I didn't really get to explain some of the things that I wanted to the way I wanted to and ...oh nevermind.  I'm tired, though.  I didn't get as much sleep as I'm used to...  I must have stayed up until at least five, reading.  Of course, I get up at six every morning.  You do the math.  I don't want to sleep away my life.  Mom says that I have to get my chores done before I have any free time.  She gave me  chores ....  So, in order to keep up with my regular reading schedule, I knocked a couple more hours off of my already short sleep, and everything's good.        I still can't wait to go to the mall with Dark.  We haven't really done anything together before, other than organizing books.  That doesn't count, because I wasn't really looking to help, I just wanted to talk to her grandfater.  Well, anyway, I'm still really excited about going, though I'm not showing it very well.      ...   My dog just broke something in my room.  I'm downstairs...and I hear this huge crash up above where my room is.  ...He was already in enough trouble...though I suppose it's my fault for leaving the door open.  Damn...      LAUNCHcast must hate me.  They're playing all of my least favorite songs... and that wouldn't be so bad if the stupid songs weren't actually speaking to me in some way, shape, or form...  What is  wrong  with me???      Oh dear....Korn....I have this CD...  I only listen to it when I'm really mad, though.  "Got The Life"  --the best song on the whole CD and it's playing right now...too bad I have to get rid of it.  I'm not mad.      Anyway.  I'm tired.  I think I'm going to go try and take a nap...after I go clean up whatever Atlas did to my room.  Le sigh.

        I've been using that word a lot lately.  Normally I try my hardest (and then a little harder) to avoid it... because more than half the time I'm just throwing a stupid little temper tantrum and taking it for granted...          No.  But I'm in a weird mood.  That tends to happen a lot.          Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  How can one person be so stupid??  I'm just so...dumb.  *bangs head repeatedly on counter-top*          I still can't help the way I feel, and I'm sorry for that.  If I could control my emotions...well, actually I'd probably feel the same way.  I don't want to lose anything...  So I guess, if I would choose for me to feel this way anyway, I have nothing to complain about...except for my stupidity.  I hate being stupid.           There I go again, with the hate word.  What is wrong with me?          I don't like being young, either.  In fact, it kind of sucks.  But...I don't want to lose my youth.  Maybe if I just grow up all energetic I can keep my youth but be respected by adults at the same time.  I hope that works.  But, I'm not there yet.  What am I supposed to do in the meantime?          I'm tired.  All of this thinking hurts my head.  I blame it on the Tylenol.  Of course, I wouldn't have to take the Tylenol if I hadn't have....great.  See where blabbering about leads me?  No, we're not getting into that.  Class Presidents, Valedictorians...people of the like shouldn't be like that...

        Mood=Very angry          I'm sick of this. I'm sick of him. I'm sick of my damned emotions and mood swings. I'm sick of my life. And that bites. Because I'm stuck with it for a very long time.          It's not my fault that something happened. You know what? I just don't care anymore. He still has every stupid terrible emotion of mine, that I hate having, wrapped around his finger, and I can't do anything about it. He's probably annoyed with me. Who isn't? Oh I don't CARE!          There's so much going on...I just want to go away...leave. But I  can't , and I  won't,  and I am just so...tired. Mentally, I'm exhausted. I've been thinking about * that*  too much!           ARGH! Nevermind... no one will fully understand this, I suppose...other than myself, and I have yet to decide whether or not that's a good thing.          Screw him. Screw the world. It could blow up any time now. I wouldn't miss anything...but that may be because I'd be dead. Hey, two for one special...

       Mood= :(      I've come to the decision that nostalgia and mood swings do not mix very well. But let me explain my whole day to get to my point.      Maia, my mother, my father, and I all decided to skip golfing and go to the cabin and have dinner together outside on the deck. Well, before dinner, I found my copies of the first two  Harry Potter  books. My father had borrowed them (as if he'd read them...), and I've been missing them something terrible for the past few weeks. Anyway, I just plopped down on one of the two couches and opened the first of the series, and just read my heart away.      The first wave of nostalgia hit me when we were at dinner. I realized that things were back to how we, our/my family, used to be. All four of us were together, eating as a whole, and talking. I guess that that experience would have been much more heartwarming than it sounds if we hadn't have talked at all. We used to have dinner together all of the time, and I would always be the "target" of most accusations or things of the like. Everyone, especially Maia, seems to take a great pleasure in pushing me up against the wall and questioning me about my interests until I have to just give in and tell them that I don't know, because often the questions they ask are so deep that there would be very little ways for me to know. Yes, they do seem to like that. And it hurts... a lot. As much as I state that I don't like my family, I still need their support. They're still family, but Maia obviously refuses to realize that. She doesn't realize how much it hurts whenever she throws an insult at me. She doesn't realize that she's the reason for why I was driven to craving solitude and books instead of quality time with the family and make-up or barbies, like any "normal" little girl. It really does hurt, but she doesn't care.      After dinner, I collected all of the dishes (we don't have a dish-washer out there, unless you count whoever washes the dishes by hand...) and took them to the kitchen. That was when another burst of memories came to me. This time, though, it wasn't so bad. I would sing to the songs on the radio while dancing and rinsing off the soapy silverware. I was having fun. I guess the only times I'm really having fun anymore are when I am alone. My family and I tend to get along better with each other when I'm in the next room, observing everything instead of being a part of it, as well. I remembered the times when I'd be doing the exact same thing countless times in the past two years, when we moved back and fourth between the house I'm at now and the little cottage I was at then.      I decided, on the way home, that I wanted to be in the passenger's seat, so I rode home with Dad, instead of Mom and Maia. This was probably one of the better decisions I've made throughout my life. Dad did have to stop at the storage unit, but I didn't mind. It was there, at the storage unit, that more memories came yet again. "These Eyes" started to play on the oldies station Dad always listens to. I hate to sound like an old geezer, but that took me back quite a bit to where Maia had her first truck. We were speeding down our road (of course...) going at least 45 over the limit, and screaming this song at the top of our lungs. That's a good memory. Four police-people (have to be politically correct these days) live down our road, two of which are retired, so they don't count...but, two is more than enough.      When I finally grew sick of doing absolutely nothing other than ruining my already ruined vision in front of the computer screen, I called it an early night and headed up to my room. Of course, I had no intention of sleeping for quite a while, but going to my room before 11 pm is a very rare occurrence, especially during the summertime. Right before I went to bed I hit the "random member" button on my Elftown account just one last time to see if anyone exciting or life-altering chanced to come across my screen. Not anyone extremely fancy, though in their description was the lyrics to Linkin Park's "My December." I decided, that being my favorite LP song, to go find the MP3 mini-disc mix that I have that particular song on and listen to it, since it's been ages.      Well, I figured I'd read a couple more chapters out of my  Harry Potter  first, and then listen. So I read up to the fifteenth chapter and took out my CD player.      Now, this mix has 48 different, very contrasting, songs on it. "My December" is the 45th. I just listened through the whole CCD (compact-compact disc, as I've come to call them), and see what happens. Yet another good choice on my part, that was.      I found myself repeating "Oh, I love that song!" at least forty-seven times...why I put Outkast's "Hey Yah" on there, we may never know. Anyway...      About twelve or thirteen of the songs are by a J-pop band called The Pillows. They are basically the "soundtrack band" to the anime series FLCL (Fooly Cooly, Furi Kuri...etc.), which happens to be the most kick-ass anime in the world, also my favorite. :) As if you couldn't tell. Anyway, I almost drove myself mad listening to "Our Love and Peace." There was a memory attached to the songs, and I was so close to being able to describe it. It was as if the memory was three millimeters out of my grasp. I could see it, feel it, I could even smell it, but I couldn't have it. (This has happened to me before, actually, but it...wasn't with a memory.) I came close to being able to describe it to myself, hoping I could remember the way everything was, but then I made a huge mistake by closing my eyes, thinking that would help. It wouldn't and didn't. Everything I had left me in an instant. Apparently, the dark isn't as welcoming as many make it out to be.      So I listened to the rest of the CCD, dozing in between tracks, therefore missing "My December," but not really caring. I needed to listen to it. It helped a lot. Not to sound cheesy or anything, but listening to it helped me realize how I've changed over the past months. Not that that doesn't happen often. I actually try to avoid a certain collection of songs for a while, just to bring them up at unexpected times and have the memories that they have attached to them wash over me. That's what music is for me; just a whole load of memories. I was asked, sometime between the 25th and 31st of July, if I loved music. I still stick with my original answer, but I have a better reason for it now than I had then, and I hope the questioner is reading this now, because he's mentioned in this entry as well, and he should probably read  that . Anyway, I still stick with "no" as my answer. I don't love music. I barely know what it is. But I have grown dependent on it. I use music to vent off swallowed emotions. And though reading helps calm me down, playing or listening to some sort of music helps me get rid of everything. No, I don't love it, it's more that I need it.      I also just realized that this is a very personal entry, more personal than any that I've written before. I'm contemplating whether publishing it or not, but I probably will anyway. There's lots in this particular entry that needs to be said...and everything is, just, it's though hints.      Well, now, at 4.06 in the morning, I'm heading off to go read some more and love on my kitty, who's probably not very happy with me. After all, she does sleep during the night...it's not my fault she chooses to sleep on my face!!!

       Mood=Meh...      I'm sorry...I'm addicted to these things. I really am.      Random questions {x} Fallen for your best friend? Yes, no...well, sort of. {x} Made out with JUST a friend? *ahem* Yes. *hangs head rather low* {x} Been rejected? Yes, but in a friendly way. Does that make sense? Maybe it wouldn't to you. You weren't there. Unless, you were...in that case... hi! *waves* {x} Been in love? Uhm... {x} Used someone? No. {x} Been used? Unfortunately, yes, and it hurt... {x} Cheated on someone?: {x} Been cheated on?: Well, not in the relationship that I'm in now, I hope. I severely doubt  that  happening. But in the one before it, the chances are more than likely. My one piece of advice that I try to follow is to never become addicted to something that slowly kills you. {x}Done something you regret? Not really. I can't help but think that if I did something different with anything, I wouldn't be the way I am today. True, I could be "better," but I'm happy with me now. {x} Considered a life of crime? Not that I ...know of... o.O {x} Considered being a hooker? No {x} Are you psycho? Isn't that for my doctor to decide? {x} Split personalities? No..well...no, mood swings don't count. {x} Schizophrenic? No {x} Obsessive? Yes... ^_^ {x} Obsessive compulsive? No {x} Dream of dead bodies, blood, death, and gore? Oh dear, no. {x} Dream of doing those things instead of just seeing them? *blush* Once or twice...but I would NEVER act on it!!! Humans, without their morals, are truly brutal creatures. {x} Understanding: I try. {x} Open-minded: Again, I try...unless you seriously piss me off, which doesn't happen very often. {x} Insecure: Very. {x} Interesting: This is a matter of opinion. Since I am me, I find nothing interesting about myself because I already know it. {x} Friendly: I can be. {x} Smart: I hope. {x} Moody: HA! Very much so... {x} Childish: I can be. {x} Independent: In some ways, yes. I can't pay my own bills or keep food on the table without the finacial aid of my parents. I can stay in a room for hours and hours without anyone around, as long as I have something to occupy myself with (books, music...). I don't need to be around those who I care about constantly. {x} Hard working: Yes. Well, I like to think so, but I'm a terrible procrastinator.   {x} Organized: In my...own little way... {x} Healthy: Unfortunately, no. {x} Emotionally stable: Very rarely. {x} Difficult: I imagine, yes, very much so. {x} Attractive: Psha. No. {x} Bored easily: No {x} Thirsty: Always. Though it isn't always quenched by a drink. {x} Responsible: I hope. {x} Sad: Of course. {x} Happy: Very. {x} Trusting: No. {x} Talkative: Around those who I am comfortable with, yes. {x} Original: Oh yes. {x} Different: Yes. {x} Unique: How many different ways can you ask the same damned question?? {x} Lonely: *sigh* Yes, but I can cope. As I said, I am fine on my own, as long as I have something to do. {x} Have a boyfriend?: Yes, actually, I do. And as of today, we've been "dating" for 8 months and 16 days. {x} Have a girlfriend?: No. {x} Current Annoyance: My life. {x} Current Favorite Group: I don't really know. {x} Current DVD In Player: My MP3 mix. {x} Current Worry: If Maia's apartment in Florida will be alright, including her two cats and all of her electronics, but mostly the cats... O.O; {x} Current Crush: {x} Current Favorite Celebrity: Heath Ledger, Ralph Fiennes, Graham Norton, Alan Cumming (oh he's so pretty).... ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Your date {x} Long or short hair? Whatever they like. {x} Dark or blond hair? Again, whatever they like. {x} Tall or short? Tall, but that's not exactly prefered. Neither is short. Physical appearance means close to nothing for me. {x} Good or bad? Good at heart with a few glitches. Perfection would drive me insane, and it's already a short enough trip! {x} Dark or light eyes?: Oh, this I can answer. I love dark eyes...well, crud, we'll just leave it at dark.      WHO DO YOU WANT TO Kill: No one. I do dislike many people, but to take someone's life...no.   Hear from: Certain others. Get really wasted with: No one. It won't happen. Look like: Me. I'm doing fairly well at it, too. Don't you think? Be like: Me. Avoid: my family.      Have you ever? Broke the law: Yes. Cheated on a test: I was seven, damnit! Played Truth or Dare: Hehehe...Mike had to hump the wall!! But yes, I have. Come close to dying: Once. Cheated on your boy/girlfriend: Stayed up till four on the phone: Oh yes. Ashley and I used to do that every night/morning when summer started. Then I changed. Fell asleep while eating: I was probably very little if I ever did. Met someone famous: Oh yes. Been in a school play: Not school, it was just for the class I was in. Cried in public: Yes. Seen someone die: In my arms, actually. It was a fairly traumatic experience that I don't really care to talk about. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ ARE YOU... A vegetarian?: No, but I don't like to live off of meat. I eat more vegetables and fruits than meat. Good grades?: Oh yes.   A good student?: I get good reports from my teachers. I don't believe in cheating...but I'm also a very very very sneeky little thing when it comes to using my teacher's trust. Good at sports?: No. I am most certainly  not  an athlete. A good singer?: My choir director likes it enough. A good actor/actress?: I haven't acted for five years, but I was good then. A deep sleeper?: No. A good dancer?: Oh how I would love to learn how to swing dance...or ballroom dance... Man I love ballroom dancing. Shy?: More so than I should be. Outgoing?: When I'm in a ticked-off mood, very. A good storyteller?: Yes, I like to think so.      --   I NEVER (oh dear...most of these should be I've never...shouldn't they???

       Mood=Passive...happy (very)      Today, my father wanted me, my sister, and Mom to go meet him at a little restaurant in town to have lunch together, since it is supposed to be the last day that Maia is with us. So, when we were done eating, I asked my parents if I could walk to, my favorite store in the world, The Bookworm, and see if my math tutor (who is also a very good friend, and owns the store) was there. Well, when I got to the store, there was a sign saying that the Bookworm is moving to the adjacent building next door. Alright then.       Walking into the new store, I was welcomed by the daughter of my tutor, who is...I think around 37...something like that. She hugged me for a welcoming...that was, weird. Not in a bad way, just unexpected. I'm not used to very much physical contact, and I don't really like being, well... touched. Anyway, she informed me that her daughter, one of the people I sit with at lunch every day when in school, was here helping the move. (there are thousands upon thousands of used books. It's beautiful, you can't even begin to imagine.) So, I went to go see her, asked if she wanted any help transporting and re-organizing the books, and found myself surrounded by piles among piles or fantasy and sci-fi books. Not that I minded. ;)      Anyway, Mom and Maia came in about fifteen minutes later. They let me stay and help Kaitlin while they went shopping and do other stuff.      Meanwhile, Kaitlin and I were keeping ourselves busy by alphabetizing at least 1,500 books, and stacking them on the shelves. Of course, there were a few domino moments in which the stack of organized books tumbled over. Lol, I mean, it was scary. We spent hours organizing and placing the books everywhere.       But it wasn't too long before I stumbled across a book that I wanted. Kaitlin told me that, instead of pay, I get free books for working. That surprised me. I didn't expect anything. I would sort books all day for free during the summer, probably even during the school year, if all of my work is finished. It's fun and stress-relieving work. I get to go back tomorrow as well and work, but Kaitlin won't be there. My tutor will, but she won't.   :( That's quite depressing. We had an absolute   blast  !!!!      Anyway, I'm trying to get at two points.      1) I came home with nine new books (four or five of which were by Ursula K. LeGuin, one of my absolute favorite authors) for doing nothing but having pure fun. Mom wasn't too pleased with this.      2 ) I judged Kaitlin way too quickly, and I started to realize this over my eighth grade year, but paid it no attention. Now I know that I've found someone in my (very small) home town that I can  have  hour long conversations about everything. She may not know of all the theories and such, but she is so much fun to be around. I absolutely adore her.  SO!!!  This brings my total friend count up to....*bumbumbummmmmm* THREE!!! Woot! *does a little happy dance*      So, when I left, I promised I'd call her and told her that we'd just  have  to get together before school started. Because we do. She is just thrilling to be around and with, and I adore her.

      I just freaked my 'friend' out by telling her that I've had (sexual) fantasies that include her... I mean, it's not  true , but it was SO worth it!  Anyway, I just got done talking to my cousin (the one who lives in China)... man I missed talking to her.  She's very...opionated...though, thankfully, not completely blinded by the sides she takes, unlike most of the Americans we associate with daily.  But it was still fun freaking Ashley out.

       Mood=Rather upset      1) Do you believe in love: in a very complicated way, sort of...   2) Do you believe in love at first sight? no   3) Are you too shy to ask someone out: no   4) Who do you want to spend the rest of your life with? my cat   5) Have you ever actually truely honestly been in love before? twice...maybe   6) Do you regret loving them? I regret being naive enough to think I was wise enough to know what "love" is. I 'm beginning to think it childish of myself to even believe in "love." I have yet to meet or be informed of a couple that does not have trust issues or a prenup. But, as with all things, this truly depends on my mood and condition.  Sometimes I've convinced myself that there is no such thing as love.  My feelings for this subject change frequently.      "Panphobia" (That little c thing, Adriane Ware)      What am I afraid of   I do not know   Is there any fancy word   That describes my fear?   I suppose panphobia   Is best for the way I feel      And yet, it does my emotions   No justice   I have explanations   --All that are relative--   For the way I feel   And what I fear      But I suppose I fear   Above all   Love      Love makes the world go   It can change the reasons   Why we live   Love can power another   To such extremes   Love is power      And love, though non-existent   Is everything   And I fear such a monopoly   I fear love, love that is everything   Does that make me   Afraid of everything?   -----      Pretty nifty poem I found that I felt described the way I feel accurately...

       Mood=(much to my disgust) Very girlie...      Okay, well, I have some explaining to do. I have (in two entries) stated that I only have one friend. *holds up one finger for clarity* Well, I'm going to now slap myself across the face, and explain  why  I said only ONE...instead of the rightful number, two...       Well, no, I'm not going to explain. I don't  feel  like explaining. Anyway, the person I was referring to in my first few entries I met when I went to Green Bay.       The second, I met when I was in seventh grade. He's much closer (distance wise) than the former, but also very different. Now, it's not like I forgot about him, it's just that I was in a  very  pissy mood, and I was narrowing my, already very narrow, definition of a "friend." It was wrong of me, yes yes yes, I know. Everyone is different, and I clearly forgot about that.       It's just that I can't have an hour-long conversation about forks, theories and just about everything (including mosquitoes) with the latter. But that's okay. Because I love them both very much... *awwwww*      O.O; Sorry about that....kind of lost track of who I am. Anyway, just wanted to clear that up a bit...

       Mood=Tired      Well I just got back from my Saginaw-Flint trip...And I figured there were a few events that were worth my time taking notes and writing in this place...      Maia decided that she needed a new pair of jeans, so she woke  me  up at eight in the morning yesterday and asked if there was a GAP in the T.C. mall. Well, no, there isn't. So she wanted to go to Saginaw, where there  is  a GAP... (she only buys her jeans from that store...)      And we're off on the road.       Now, I love my sister more than any other immediate family member that I know of (sorry for those who are related and reading this, it's true), but there are some things about her that frighten me. For example... Maia's driving is made for the Autobahn. The only reason why she doesn't go 120 mph on the highway is because the car simply can't  go  that fast. Anyway, it took us about 80 minutes to go roughly 130-135 miles.  You  do the math. Though, it is fun, and I have some stats for you about my lovely sister...      # of times she said the F-word (directed at another vehicle): 84   # of times she flipped another vehicle off: 32   # of time she honked the horn at another vehicle: 12      And, what's really funny is that, she is one of the biggest hypocrites I have ever met, excluding myself, that is. And it's useless to point out to her that it's not fair to yell at the car that just cut her off when  she  just did the EXACT same thing five times in a row to various vehicles.      Anyway, we didn't know what exit to get off at to go to Saginaw, so, to put it short, we ended up going to Flint to visit Mom and go to lunch with her. After lunch, Maia and I decided that we would go to the Flint mall and spend the night with Mom in the hotel she was staying at.      Well, it turns out that the Flint mall doesn't have a GAP either (though I tried telling my sister that many times, she still didn't listen...). So we finally did end up going to Saginaw, where she bought two pairs of jeans and a new zip-up sweatshirt. I found this rather comical, considering she lives in FLORIDA!!! The only real time you need a sweatshirt in Florida is when you visit your family in Michigan... Lol.... Anyway...      At the mall, Maia dragged (is that a word, dragged?) me through Aeropostale, Abercrombie and Fitch, GAP, PAC SUN, and another store of the like. Please excuse the spelling if I didn't get the names correct, I don't visit them often. So here I am, in my very plain navy-ish blue jeans and a hoody with my sister who is wearing "fashionable" clothes, walking into those particular stores. Now, I don't really mind the style of clothing that much, in fact, some of the latest "styles" are rather interesting, considering I used to dress like that years before it was "in." Anyway, like I said, I don't mind (some) of the clothes they sell, it's just that I don't exactly fit in. I don't wear name brand clothing unless it's on sale or extremely tempting to the point that I'd rather buy a shirt instead of a new book (this rarely happens, as I'm sure you can imagine). I'm also not the skinniest of people. Very few articles of clothing in Aero or Abercrombie or the like fit me...not that I let that bother me  too  much.      But, I something valuable may come out of this trip yet. At Abercrombie, I think it was...there was the store manager in the middle of the store, bitching out one of her employers. Quoting Maia, or close to it, "Don't  ever  bitch out an employer in the middle of the runway, it's bad business."      Granted, she did say this with her serious/mock-playful tone (you'd understand this more if you knew my sister...), but I don't think she realized that what she said actually did go through one ear, but didn't go out the other.... It's true, ...business and money (or lack thereof) go hand in hand...And they both pretty much run the world. So in my philosophical state, I started to think (this time it didn't even give me a headache...). Anyway, I came to quite a few conclusions, though I don't really care to post them up here. They're mine alone...you'd think I'd gone crazy if I put  all  of my thoughts up here.      Anyway, I have come to the decision that I am going to isolate myself from the rest of my family when I grow older. I really really really dislike all of my immediate family very much. The only family I truly can stand to be around for more than three days at a time either lives in Texas or China, with the more favorable in China, only because she's so much like me!!! Or..I'm like her...either way...we're alike.      So, plan one:   Move to China, live near my cousin and her family, but not too close. Start a life that is worth living (a.k.a. out of the USA...).      Plan two:   Move to France with Alex when I am old enough. Yes, we would probably kill ourselves in the making, but it would be fun.      Plan three:   Move to either the UK or Germany. Continue my studies...And...be "happy" ...      Are you sensing a pattern here? No? Well, here's a clue. Look at the first word of all three plans...

       Mood=Tired  "Waited on the line of greens and blues Just to be the next to be with you."  I don't know what's going on, but I've been in a rather musical mood lately, and not my normal musical state. I normally only have classical music stuck in my head... Somehow those two lines are speaking to me right now. I have a headache...I blame every stupid and nonsensical comment (in this entry) on the headache. ;)  My sister wants to go to the mall in Saginaw. ... Ummm....Well, not counting the little collection of stores in Traverse, I've only been to a real mall once... I was going to say no, when she offered, but she just told me we could go into the (very large, might I add) Borders that is right next to the mall. Well, HELL YES!!! Problem is, Borders is rather expensive, and I don't have any money...but I can start making my Christmas list early, can't I?  Hah, that brings up another ordeal. Christmas. *shivers* No, nevermind, I'm not in the mood to get into  that  particular conversation...  "Where can I find a girl like that??? ...Jesse's girl..." Yet another good song from way before my time *sigh*...I'm weird(er).  I spoke to my friend last night. Remember the one friend that I have??? Well, that's him, and it's really funny because I have a thousand things to talk to him about or ask him, and whenever we actually  talk  I either forget them or am waaayyy too shy to ask... I wish I knew what was wrong with me. But I doubt that will ever happen.

       Mood=Passive/Apathetic      I've come to the decision that I am not as depressed as everyone makes me out to be.  I used to be all hyper and giddy, but I like being laid back and just...well, the way I am now.  *points to her mood*        But,  man,  I love this song.      "Come all you coalminers   Wherever you may be.   And listen to the story   That I relate to thee."   ...   "Coalminers, won't you wake up   And open your eyes and see   What this dirty capitalist system   Has done to you and me."      It's a very good song.  I don't know the name of it, though I know that it's by Uncle Tulepo...or something like that.  It's still a good song.  You should go listen to it...find it on LaunchCast or something.  Just go find it!  Make a weirdo happy...      *sigh* I'm tired.  I'm very confused about a lot of things, and I just want to go to bed.  But I can't sleep.  It's almost impossible for me...  I've been very...different ...lately.        Blue-eyed-son is playing right now.  "Cafe Des Amis"  ...what an awesome song.  I should go find the CD.  But I can't find the lyrics anywhere.  Oh well...      Oh and you know what else???  "Fast Car" was on the radio today.  I love that song.  You should too...though it is a bit...sad...but I love it...  Anyway, that's it for my song entry...

       Mood=Passive      Mom thinks I'm weird.   Reasons for Mom to think her daughter (HER ONE PRIDE AND JOY!!!) is weird:      "Unkown."   "To Be Determined."       Those are exact quotes from the woman herself...   I keep trying to remind her that I could be one of those mock-goths (or real goths, for all I know) running around in the major public with liquid white paper and black clothing with piercings who KNOWS where.... but she has a sufficient come-back.  "Nooo you couldn't."      That statement is usually followed by the oh so cliche, but effective, death threat; "I brought you into this world, I can take you out of it."  Of course, when she's in a really...interesting....mood, she'll color that up with a few... decorative...words....   *sigh*   I love my mom......      --Mom is walking out door to go get pizza (much to my disgust.......)   "BYE!!! We'll be back!!"   --I reply.   "BYE!!! Don't die!!!"   --Mom...   "Oh thanks, I'll try not too...."   .....   *cough*

       Mood=Lazy  Well, here I am, starting yet ANOTHER 'blog ...Because my first one didn't work out too well... *sigh*  Today has been fairly interesting for me. I  was  going to go tryout for basketball, but when I got to the gym, I realized I didn't have a physical. Cripe. Oh well. It wasn't that big of a deal, it's just that I made a fool out of myself (yet again), and I really wanted to be on the team. So, Mom picked me up and I went and got my physical. But, the thing is, I'm too embarrassed to go back. *sigh*  Since my wonderful sister is up from college in Florida for the week, we were going to go fishing (why, I don't  know... I severely dislike fishing), but it was rainy, and I don't like going fishing *coughatallcough* in the rain. So to make up for our loss, we went to the video store and rented six or seven movies. See? Everything balances out.  I don't really know what to say. I think I'm just going to go find one of those survey things that I have on Elftown and fill that out. Yeah, that'd work... It's just that I have to find one that is relatively appropriate or grammatically correct (remember I said relatively), because I'm too lazy to change it...  AHA! I like this one...

What would they hold most important : Life  A celebrity that best portrays their looks : No one...I suppose the closest would be Remus Lupin in   Harry Potter and the PoA  , played by David Thewlis, but that is still a long way off. Oh no! I completely forgot. Dr. Henry Jekyll in   Mary Riley   looks somewhat like I would have imagined as well. A character that best portrays their personality: Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward Hyde in  Mary Riley . (I like that movie.)  Or Remus Lupin in any of the   Harry Potter   books.  Loud and bubbly or silent and reserved : Either all or none.  They would be the King/Queen, Jester, Warlord/Lady, Traveling Minstril, Clumsy Magician, or Silent Black Knight : Hmm, the whole Minstril bit is a nice thought...  They would catch your eye by : Coming up to me and introducing themselves other than trying some stupid stunt or some (terrible) pick-up line... Because I have neither a dick nor microphone... *wonders how many understood that joke*  Cute thing they do to get your attention : Speak.  They would capture your heart by : Offering options.    THE ABODE  Have your own pad : I hope.  What's in it : Books. Books. A fish tank that will, sooner or later, have three fish in it. More books. Um... all of the necessary objects like food, a fridge, a bathtub, all of that stuff... and... just one huge library... I could stand for that.  Live with anyone : My fish.  Color of your walls : You can't really tell... they're covered by bookshelves (not to be repetitive or anything...).  The most immediate object to your left : My shoes.  What would look good on the wall : Bookshelves.  Have any pets : Sure. I have Lionardo, Albert, and Cynthia.    FAVES    Favorite holiday : My birthday.  Favorite cd : Undecideable.  Favorite song : ...  Favorite game : Chess. I've also grown fairly attatched to Hearts.  Favorite show : The Graham Norton Effect.  Favorite movie : Mary Riley (BIG surprise there...)  Favorite band/singer : This is just way too hard.  Favorite toy : Excuse Me?  Favorite past-time : Reading. Learning.    IN THE BEDROOM    (*blush*)   How would you describe your performance : Um... non-existent!!!  Ideal partner : *sputter*  Like a gentle feel or some adventurous fun : O.O;  What would set the mood : Lol, the  mood  is not to be set...  What would you find irresistable : HA!! You think you can lure me into bed with a book!!!!    CURRENTLY    Watching t.v. or listening to music : Neither.  What's on : Nothing.  Websites you're at : United.com (I don't know why.) And Elftown....of course.  Conversing with anyone : Steven, but he's pretty quiet.  Aside from this survey, what are you doing : Existing.  What do you wish you were doing : Reading.  What are you thinking : That would be none of your business.  Date and Time : August ninth, 3.03 pm...       Well, that's it for now....   --   Astra   --
