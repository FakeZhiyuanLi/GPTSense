      im trying to think of a story to say to make this whole thing more interesting...i have always wandered why i cant remember stuff from when i was younger like i used to have a friend who could remember times all the way back from when she was in a stroller and unless she was a retard adn was in a stroller till she was 9 thats pretty amazing. one of the longest ago memories i have is when my parents came back from santa fe and brought me this totally awsome blue hat i was like wtf and i was in the office just layin on the bed and i was like yep that my blue hat... this was 2 weeks ago haha no j-k more like when i was 5 which is still way way to late i only have one strong strong memory of elementry school ok scratch that 2 memories.. i remember taking showers before school trying to convince myself i wasnt gay and how could i do this like how coudl i even think i was gay i hadent even masturbated like ever so how would i know i liked boys i guess this does mean its in the geans.. ok yeah that was the first movie and then the second one was of me sitting on the bench in the playground in the sun with my fat little legs in shorts wandering if i was gay wow that really seemed to rule my life when i was in elementry school didnt it.. the reason this was my only memories from elementry school is because this was elemntry school for me hahaha.. hmm well this was an intereting story i will talk about my&nbsp; most embaracing moment i was like i donno how old but i went to this BBQ place with my fam and i had to pee with my little boy penis and the bathroom was one of those ghetto out door ones. ok so i gotta pee and mom is like DANNY take him to pee so he does and guess what soon as i get in the bathroom the door closes and stays closed its like frigin locked i started immeadatly crying. it ended up with daddy having to kick down the door and by then the whole restraunt had pilled out to stare at the situation i was just like  shit on a stick  but of corse at that age i did not know these words i learned all my stuff in 4th grade about sex and stuff ..............................................im just full of randomness tonight and now i need to get offline so i can sleep i want to start goin to sleep early so i can wake up early to go get skinny yay bahhhhh

      so hear i am thinking about my life and the good aspects of it and the bad and of corse i know the good outweigh the bad 100 to 1 but yet that 1 that 1 bad thing is always cauzed by none other then ME.. i used to think it was not but i did somethign today stupid and it was MY fault.. if we have 1% bad in our life and we are the ones that make it then why even 1% why now 0 none nothing bad at all............my mom was like i will be ready in 10 minutes so i was like ok i will be in teh car so what i did was went in the car backed it out and said hmm i will drive it in the neighborhood for like 5 minutes and then mom will never know well what i did was get to the stopsign look around and there were no cars of any kind so i was like hey lets see how fast this car can go so i flored it for like 5 seconds and then i came back turned around and did it once more it was fun i knew i wouldnt hurt anyone it was empty i was being a teenager but on the way back the second time some lady came running out of her house yelling at me SLOW DOWN STOP STOP STOP needless to say i kept going as she ran behind the car yelling still i was scared to death so of corse i coudlnt park the car back in teh drive way she would see which house and come over and talk to my parents so i had to keep going for 5 minutes and yeah when i got back she was gona but guess who was outside now looking for me MY MOM yeah she she was pissed why did u take the car bla bla bla so i mean what if this lady sees my dad driving that car and stops him and says hey ur kid was speedin and then he will be pissed at me bla bla bla i know its not anythign that will get me in major trouble but i could have prevented all this time of me thinking about what could happen to me ...................after i got home from my errend with mom i watched this movie on indemand tv "along came polly" yeah it is cute and funny but in the end there is this part where the dad is yelling at sandy telling him that all he ever does is think in the past and that he is in this thing called life and what you have to do is play the game go along with it cz if you dont ur gonna get to the end and realize you wasted it. this hit me like a bat in the head that i know i am a teenager and i am not supposed to be perfect to any extent this is the time in your life when you mess up the most but i also know that i am the one that makes myself mess up so i want to try to THINK before i act i know i cant stop from being me and being me is being risky i cant change that its me but i do feel bad abotu a lot of the things i have done i just want to get on my canoe and rid this river of life and ride it right. i want to get out of this town i want to skip highschool  and go travel hitchhiking doing odd jobs along the way meeting new people eating new food being happy i think thats a real life not going through education your never going to use and then geting a job in buisness to add the the hype of the thing we call WORLD . i want to go back to the way things were and be free to do what i want and stuff. i know this cant happen but i still want it i want it more then anything  i just i love my life but as teenagers always do they want more as humans do they want more more to life for more just more  hey kids its the word of the day   MORE

      soooooo i am sorry for the wait i just i didnt think that i was going to get into the whole blog thing but i will try and i am pretty sure after a few weeks it will just become habit and not something i have to tell myself to do.... well my life has changed so much since my last post...it seems as if sasha wasnt meant to be. when we went on our fist date there was a shirt that we passed that said ditch him so maybe her and i shoulda split it up there right then instead of waiting for this train wreck to happen. ok so she gets back from camp and is all bitch likt i did something wrong and i have idea and so she wont talk to me and so appearantly she hears from someone that i cheat on my g-f's and i soo dont i did once back like a year ago but that was it and so now she has that impression and then she reads this persons xanga that just happppens to be rachels hmm how ironic lol and it says i had a great time last night it was amazing thanks for the cd so that confirms her thoughts about me cheating but how do you think she got the xanga adress well she got it from a friend of a friend of a friend i donno but for some reason she decided to read it and i mean it just has to be like fate for her to read that and to start hating me and so i feel like i am meant to be with rachel and its so true shes just amazing theres nothign wrong with her i dont know why i didnt see this before but yet i still have that thougt in my head lik ei should mess around with other girls and i plan to but i mean i like rachel so much maybe i should just amke it a final thing and never do it again but you have to realize that so much of my life is talkin to girls about messing around i mean gah if i took that out i might have to relie (is that a word) on rachel so much that it might scare her away so i think that i dont know its like a lose lose situation and i need to pick one that will make me happier in the long run. if i stay with rachel then i will have a long fun relationship that could last years but then when it ends so does the friendhship and omg its a great one but if i keep on with the slut girls that will jsut give me happiness for that short while not in the long run i know that it will be hard to not makeout with other girls but i am going to makemyself stay with rachel cz this is what i figure... if i died who would miss me more the sluts or rachel..........rahcel so there ya go wahoo i love her hahah what does that word mean!! i dont think its aloud to have a meaning when you are a teenager it gets thrown around so much like even if you are the most mature teenager in your school you cant be in love because all the other shitheads around you that go out for 2 days and are like i love you use it way to much... i think you know when your in love when you cant describe it maybe like when you talk to someone and they are like i am in love the person always asks well how do you know and the person is like well i just get so happy around them bla bla bla but i t hink if you are inlove for real you just say its just is its not something that words can describe you know and another thing about love today i heard doctor phil say that  the long lasting couples lasted so long because they didnt fall out of love with eachother at the same time i mean think about it its so true if you have a man that has been married for 14 years and then realizes hes wasting his life in a job he dosent like and on a woman that only has sex every 4 weeks and he dosent love well hes gonna be pretty bumed but if he knows his wife loves him more then anything then what the hell hes gonna stay with her but if he senses the wiff getting irratable too that relationship is soo over. i have no idea if any of this makes any sence and i could go on about this for hours but i will leave more of my mind for other blogs.. my friends!! please yell at me if i dont post lol haha alright you guys have a great day and i want you to know that i LOVE (gets thrown aroudn to much) you guys so much i know i feel deeply because when i think about life without you i want to go crawl in a hole and jj in a hole = no fun so you are what keeps me goin what keeps me happy what keeps me in a good mood as long as you know that then our happiness togehter will never stop ever ....i love you
