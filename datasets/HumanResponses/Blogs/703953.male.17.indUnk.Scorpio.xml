      Simone, I've added your live journal to the blog roll.  If this is not cool, you can log in and delete it or let me know and I'll delete it.  Lainie, where's your blog?  Carleton, you said you've got a few on the go...add'em in.  Who else has a blog or a livejournal?

      C101's friend Dominic Gabello reports good news for the Kerry-Edwards ticket in Virginia on the Virignia Young Democrats blog:  Virginia voters 18 to 34 support Kerry at 52 beautiful percent!  Read the whole post  urlLink here .  If we can turn out the Youth Vote and the vote of people of color, we can carry this state and take the White House.

      I strongly believe that GLBT (Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender)Rights will be the political issue for our generation that the Civil Rights movement was to our parent and grandparents. I also believe down the road it will be the litmus test for politicians: were you on the right side of the issue from the start, or did you pander to your anti-civil rights voters and them jump on the bandwagon once the issue started gaining in popularity?  I've been thinking about this because of what Carlton wrote in his  urlLink "values"  post earlier this week:  Many blacks maintain conservative views on social issues due to their strong connection to the Church. Let's look at the powder keg behind that one little sentence.  Regardless of what the Democrats actually *do* for African Americans (which is a whole other worthwhile discussion, and one I'm looking forward to Kara and others posting on), African Americans are a key constituency in the Democratic base vote.  Conventional wisdom dictates that a Democrat in a contested election needs to carry their precincts with high African American populations in order to carry the vote.  Conventional wisdom likewise dictates that African Americans are social conservatives, and will not support GLBT issues.  Which means that Democrats with a large number of African American constituents *believe,* rightly or wrongly, that if they support GLBT civil rights, they will lose the African American vote...and lose their election.  In other words, we have a problem.  1.  Where else can the GLBT community turn?   We've already written off the Log Cabin Republicans, so all that leaves are the Greens. Could GLBT civil rights be the issue that galvanizes the Green Party and pushes them onto the national political scene as a viable third party? Even my crystal ball can't get a good read on this, but my guess is that while this is a long shot, the issues at play are so important and so powerful, that it is at least a remote possibility. And a scary possibility, because we really want all of the Greens as well as the GLBT community to come home to the Democrats and help us re-invent the party from the inside.  2.  If the Democrats support GLBT issues, where will our African American voters turn?   The Republicans have been courting them for years--courting them in the same lip-service way, mind you, that they court women and Arab Americans. Will they fall for it? Or will they just stay home? Keep in mind that the Republicans have at the same time been *actively* campaigning to suppress the African American vote, and we're not just talking about Florida. Hit a man or woman with a stick enough times...and eventually they will stop doing whatever it was they think brought on the stick. Behavior modification 101.   3. How do we reframe the debate?  The solution to me, for the Democrats, the GLBT community, and for African Americans, is to start a dialogue towards demonstrating that this really is the civil rights movement revisited. Part of how Republicans succeed is their divide and conquer strategy of driving wedge issues to fracture the country and alienate natural allies--there is a belief here that there are only so many civil rights and only so much success to go around, and every new group needs to hold onto their own little piece before someone else takes it away. This view obviously ignores the fundamental truth that we sink or swim together, and that so long as one of us is not free, none of us are free.  One of my favorite definitions of feminism has always been that feminists don't want a bigger piece of the pie, we want to make a better pie for everyone. How can we reframe the newest civil rights battle in this way?  And folks, I'm not asking rhetorically:  I want to know, and I want to know what you think.    How aware are your peers of GLBT issues?     Is anyone you know talking about Virginiai's House Bill 751?     How do we get support for GLBT struggles from African American Community?     And how do we make it "politically safe" for Democrats to give the GLBT community the support they deserve?   The burden for change and the moral responsibility will weigh most heavily on the shoulders of our generation.  Let's get talking and brainstorming.

       (I am posting this for Jeff, from his vista in the Cloakroom.  ~Shaula)   ...a little bit about whats going on on capital hill in case you havent been watching C-SPAN 24/7....    Today there was a suspension bill called H.Res 728 on the floor of the House of Representatives.  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the actions of terrorists will never cause the date of any presidential election to be postponed and that no individual or agency should be given the authority to postpone the date of a presidential election.  It was introduced by Rep. Ney, a REPUBLICAN on House Administration.  How did the vote turn out?  YEA- 419    NAY-2    Not exactly a partisan contention... it was close to unanimous consent.   Jeff added in his email to me that Republicans who support postponing the election  are clearly way out of the mainstream of their own party.   I haven't seen much about this in the news yet but I am interested to see how both parties spin the story. ~Shaula

      This came down the pipeline from the International Coalition of Academics Against Ocupation:    Overlooked by the U.S. Press is the escalating assassination of Iraqi academics, intellectuals, and lecturers. More than 250 college professors since April 30, 2003, according to the Iraqi Union of University Lecturers, have been the targets of assassination.   You can view the entire article  urlLink here.  This is troubling. REAL troubling. Often times, social and cultural progress begins in the academics of a nation. Now this isn't to say that there haven't been many other innocent Iraqis dying due to the occupation (check out some of the more tear jerking moments of  urlLink Moore's flic ), but the death toll among proffessors and other intellectuals is evidence that this war will leave a lasting social effect on the nation. The United States has an obligation under the Geneva Conventions to care for the welfare of those citizens who live under&nbsp;its occupation. I'd like to remind the policy makers about that, but  urlLink I imagine they're already informed.    And who can post an entry without talking about the  urlLink 9/11 commission ? I hate to tell you I told you so, but:    On the alleged connection between Iraq and al Qaeda, panel members said that while there had been contacts between the regime and the terrorist group, no concrete evidence emerged of a strategic partnership.   "There was no question in our minds that there was a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda," Kean said. "We have found no relationship whatever between Iraq and 9/11."   "Conversations, yes," Hamilton added, "but nothing concrete."

       urlLink Senator Tom Daschle's floor speech today  redefines the terms of the debate:   Doing Right By America   In just over 100 days, the American people will make an historic and fateful decision.  They will decide whether we stay the course we’re on, or move our country in a new and better direction.  As I’ve traveled around South Dakota and the nation, I’ve heard a lot about the hopes and dreams Americans have for their families. I’ve listened to ranchers and farmers, teachers and mothers, police officers and firefighters.  I am always humbled by the honesty of their message. Families in South Dakota and across our nation aren’t asking for special deals or special advantage. All they want is a fair opportunity on a level playing field. They want to know that there’s only one set of rules, and that the game isn’t rigged against them.  Most of all, they want to know that as we make decisions affecting the future of our country, our first priority is Doing Right by America.    urlLink Read More of this amazing speech...   Senator Daschle does everything in this speach that Democrats need to do to win:   (Re-)Define the terms of the public debate  (Re-)Claim the moral high ground  Champion the issues of working class Americans  Offer real policy solutions  Speak everyday language  Hold the Republicans publically accountable for their betrayals of the American people   Reading this has made my day.    My only question is, why is this speach coming from Tom Daschle and not John Kerry?

      I'm sure we've all been following the 'Values' debate between Bush and Kerry. What are the important values? Restricting a woman's right to choose (aka upholding the ideals of sexual morality) or telling the truth to the nation you lead before committing it to a war  urlLink with dire consequences? &nbsp;  Or perhaps true values are found in being insensitive towards the GLBT community! Hey, what better way is there to&nbsp;secure the votes of patriotic 35-65 year old white males than by institutionalizing hatred towards homosexuals? Well it's nice to know that Pres. Bush can't do this without upsetting the proverbial waters, and this time in the GOP itself.  Here's an excerpt from an article found on  urlLink The Advocate :  Patrick Guerriero, executive director of conservative gay rights group Log Cabin Republicans, has been getting asked one particularly humorous question a lot these days: "So who are you going to vote for? John Kerry or Ralph Nader?" After all, he and his group of gay Republicans have seemingly been hung out to dry by the Bush administration and its backers in Congress. This week Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate pushed for but failed to pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. A procedural vote on the proposal needed 60 votes to pass but went down on Wednesday by a vote of 48 votes backing the amendment to 50 against. Still, Guerriero and his fellow gay conservatives have been left feeling beleaguered by all the antigay rhetoric that surrounded the Senate debate. "I do a lot of soul-searching," Guerriero admitted. "Our membership is ticked off." Feel free to  urlLink peruse the entire article.  It's a good read.  As it stands now Bush's anti-GLBT position is a selling point to maintain his far-right constituency. On the other hand, gay rights often ends up antagonizing some parts of Kerry's support base. Many blacks maintain conservative views on social issues due to their strong connection to the Church. It's nice to know that the Log Cabin cats will speak out against injustice even if they have an -R behind their name.

      The concept of a victory for Bush this year is a rather frightening thought. I often fall into the trap of assuming that most people feel the same way. Unfortunately, that's not true. Just look at his foreign policy. The evidence is right there, and yet many still choose to defend  urlLink it .  &nbsp;  The fact of the matter is that Pres. Bush is displaying one of the shoddiest foreign policies in recent history. If you read Brzezinski's new book,  The Choice,  you'll see that he points to international cooperation as the key to future success. That's not only the case in the Middle East, it's the case in Europe and the Far East and EVERYWHERE. But it doesn't take a man with Brzezinski's reputation to tell us that. Isn't it obvious? Can you really continue to act unilaterally in a world where new and powerful weapons are dispersing so rapidly? Sure, war is an option when you're fighting a nation that poses no real threat, but what if this were a war with Iran? What if it were a war with North Korea? Frankly, in my opinion, war has become obsolete.&nbsp;The guns have&nbsp;become so big, and the bombs so dreadful, and the chemical warfare so icky that given an even fight, both sides will witness massive loss of life, and both sides will lose.  &nbsp;  So why the unilateralism? Why the our way or the highway? Maybe because the higher-ups are too concerned with losing our place as global hegemon? Maybe it's just liberal optimism talking, but I trust the global community a lot more than the neoconservatives do who are influencing the White House's policies. Bah. Calling them neoconservatives gives them too much credit. Neoconservatives at least have a heart.  &nbsp;  I'm not even playing the whole 'oil-driven/corruption'  urlLink card . Regime change is needed. But not in the middle east. It's needed right here at home. Polls show that a large group of foreigners see the US as the greatest threat to international security. Put that in your 'global leader of democracy and the free-world'&nbsp;pipe and smoke it. Does anybody remember Woodrow Wilson? He was the man who ended World War I (or at least that's who the global community gave the credit to). Now that was a brilliant man. Following the War, he was absolutely the most popular man on the face of the planet. And through the course of a few years (and&nbsp;many many frustrating nights of Congressional debate)&nbsp;he lost it all. Fast forward to 2004. After September 11th, Bush had an enormous international mandate. He could have harnessed that power in order to take steps forward in creating a safer and more stable international system. Instead he burnt the reputation of the US to shambles.  &nbsp;  Prime Minister Tony Blair took full responsibility for taking his nation into war under false pretenses, but in the end, the Bush administration still finds ways to  urlLink avoid  such a statement. It's about time the president got himself some balls.

      The Chicageo Tribune has a story today on  urlLink the political power of blogs:       Blogs--short for Web logs, which are online journals that usually feature commentaries on daily events and provide links to other Web sites--are emerging as potentially powerful tools for building grass-roots political support.    "Blogs are the new face of politics," Seemann, of Canton, Ohio, said. "We are on the ground level of what will be shaping up as the future of political campaigning."     While scores of political blogs don't go beyond gossip and bickering, many are quite influential, analysts say...          urlLink Read More...

      ...check out this  urlLink flash animation  about what happened with the voter purge list in 2000.   Via Ian at  urlLink BOPnews .    Jay Myerson is General Counsel to the Democratic Party of Virginia.  He swung by Campaign 101 late in the afternoon of Sunday, July 11.  Most of you had left to face the long drives home, but Jay spent about half an hour talking with those of us were left about the 2000 Florida Recount, which he and Jack Young led for the Gore campaign.  Prevailing wisdom says that if the Gore team had listened to Jay and Jack..we'd be  re-electing  Gore right now.  I highly recommend Jeffrey Toobin's book  urlLink Too Close to Call ,which gives a play by play of what happened with the recount--for those of you who missed hearing it first-hand from Jay.

      I've been wanting to talk with everyone about is the power of voting with your wallet.  When I grew up, the mantra was "the personal is political." I'm curious if this is a concept that you're even familiar with--the idea that your consumer decisions (including not buying, or choosing to recycle or buy second-hand) are a logical extension of your personal politics.    Making political decisions as a consumer is a radical concept in such a consumption-oriented society.  It is also an easy practice to adopt that adds mindfulness and moral awareness to our everyday actions.  For me, this means not shopping at Walmart (do you know about Walmart's labor practices or the Walmart class action suit that is pending right now), it means supporting local businesses, it means buying organic and fair trade products when they are available.  And, it means I don't support corporations that contribute to the Republicans.  It also means, and this is the radical part in our culture...choosing to do without or make do with less so that I can afford to sometimes pay more for goods and services that are consistent with my personal beliefs.  And it means I take responsibility for my own ignorance, and try to educate myself so I can make informed decisions.    I have two specific examples for you.  Ian Welsh, on  urlLink The Blogging of the President  has a well-researched and well-written post up about the  urlLink differences between Wal-Mart and Costco : Be clear, both provide cheap goods for consumers and good profits for investors, so the only question is this: do you want citizens who are workers to be well treated, well paid employees who have healthcare or not?  Choose your model for America. I know which model I prefer.  The article is excellent, and so are the comments beneath it.  Read the whole thing  urlLink here .  In a similar vein, I've been posting  urlLink on my own blog  lately about the problems with Amazon.com and  urlLink the many great reasons I prefer Powell's Books:   It's all about voting with my wallet (the only way I can vote here) and putting my money where my mouth is...instead of putting my money where their jackboots are.  I hope you'll read the whole post  urlLink here , and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject.

      Anybody catch Rev. James A. Forbes, Jr. speak tonight at the DNC? Look familiar? That's my uncle, and a great man. He's a shining example that being religious does not necessarily mean you have to be conservative. The Boston Globe interviewed him recently:    Q. Regular churchgoers overwhelmingly vote Republican. What does that suggest about the two political parties?  A. In my sermon, I may call people to read  urlLink Isaiah 58 . In it, we get evidence that religion can express itself in two directions. One is personal piety, reflected in church attendance and public display of one's religious identification. Another aspect is the prophetic critique. In [Isaiah], it's almost as if God would say, forget about how often you go to church, forget about how many times you pray; what I want you to do is feed the hungry, take the homeless into your homes, care for those who are incarcerated. In  urlLink Matthew 25 , the issue is, when I was hungry, you didn't feed me, when I was poor and naked, you didn't clothe me.  The polls will give the impression that folks are more religious on the basis of how much they go to church. I'm a pastor; I want folks to come. But the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights are rooted in a call for justice. Otherwise, people will punch their cards — "See, I went [to church] 12 times." But you did not provide resources for [the needy].  &nbsp; Check out the full interview  urlLink here.    p.s.- I actually got the material for this entry from  urlLink Philocrites , an excellent blog commenting on liberal religion and politics.

      Is it really important what Mrs. Kerry says to a right-wing reporter when there's all kinds of other nonsense occurring in the world? Here's some quick tid bits on the international scene that I'll try to throw together before the DNC is called to order.  It seems Bush is finally trying to do something with North Korea. He's offered "concessions" but North Korea seems to believe (as would any rational international actor) that it is  urlLink too little too late. &nbsp;In order to make any sort of headway with North Korea Bush, I feel it will take a real non-aggression agreement. That's a shame, because it's contrary to the US's national interests to bind our hands with a volatile country like N. Korea, but that's what Bush's cowboy diplomacy has done to our credibility.  Not that the Bush administration is really concerned with North Korea at all.  urlLink Many point to Iran &nbsp;as the next focus of Bush's pushy foreign policy. The problem is that Iran has plenty more staying power than Iraq. Trouble in&nbsp;Baghdad will be nothing compared to the bombshell they would unleash if they went&nbsp;after Tehran.  And while all of this is going on, the administration&nbsp;continues to turn a blind eye&nbsp;when it comes to our&nbsp;brothers in Africa. There's a  urlLink horrible genocide going on in Sudan &nbsp;at this very moment. Many people are aware of it, but the Bush administration sits on its hands and does nothing to help as that  urlLink poor nation starves.  Sure the state department says we're  urlLink doing things to help,  and Powell assures us that we're sending plenty of aide, but as I've said before Powell's opinion is all but moot in the current administration. I feel that he actually cares about the turmoil in Sudan, but just like his efforts with AIDs, I fear his lamentations will fall on deaf ears.  But hey, who are we to frown upon crimes against humanity, when the Republican controlled House still chooses to fund  urlLink training in torture?   That's all for now. I've got to get ready for work and set up the VCR to tape the primetime speeches tonight. DNC = Hurray!

      Are you familiar with the  urlLink Cost of War  counter?           (I've just added one to  urlLink Tsuredzuregusa .)  As I write this, the money that Bush has looted from American taxpayers to squander on his illegal invasion of Iraq has just topped $127,554 MILLION dollars.    To put that number in perspective, it could have hired 2,372,522 additional public school teachers across the country.  So far, Virginia's share of the cost has surpassed $3 BILLION dollars.  With that money, we could have hired 59,222 new teachers in Virginia -- or 1,017 teachers in Richmond alone.  We could have likewise used that money to provide full, 4-year university scholarships to 78,863 Virginia students.  The US could have  fully funded  the global anti-hunger program for  5 years .  Stop and think about that.  Not a single man, woman or child would have to go hungry  anywhere  on this planet for a full five years.    But instead, we are killing Iraqi civilians and American service people so that Bush, Cheney, Halliburton and the Carlyle Group can make a quick buck.  Check out the  urlLink Cost of War website --by the time you look, the figures I have quoted above will be obsolete.  How would you feel about adding a cost of war counter to C101 as well?  Update: Here is another way to put those  urlLink big finance numbers in perspective .

      Anybody catch  urlLink Bush's speech to the Urban League?  Not only was the body of his speech unconvincing, but he led it off with a lengthy informal period of what I like to refer to as "shout outs." The President must have been advised that it's customary among "black folks" to give props to your close associates. Now anyone could tell the President was just trying to lead into his speech with a bit of levity, but when you turn down the NAACP is it really right to begin a speech by implying that T. Willard Fair, pres. of Miami's Urban League, drank all of the president's beer? Or how about when he told Al Sharpton he appreciated him "throwing his hat in the ring." It's not that it sounded  condescending , it's just... well no. It did sound condescending. You might as well have given Sharpton a little league baseball cap and had the president patting him on the back and telling the little tyke to try&nbsp;harder next time.   REVEREND SHARPTON: It's not over.  THE PRESIDENT: There you go. It's not over. (Laughter and applause.) Just don't declare right now. (Laughter.) Welcome. Glad you're here.   *sigh of disgust* Yeah there ya go W. Give the little guy some encouragement. Bush came to the speech with the mindset that he was a big big dog and was gracing this not so big organization with his presence. OH HEY! THE PRESIDENT IS JOKING AROUND WITH US! LET'S GIVE HIM OUR VOTE!!!! (sarcasm) Does he realize the immense uphill battle he would have to fight to really get the black vote? It takes more than a one-stop shop for small businesses. When will he set up a one-stop shop for victims of racism and prejudice? When will he learn that sticking a Colin Powell in his staff and then  urlLink ignoring Powell's opinions  does not constitute a positive agenda for civil rights?    urlLink Read a transcript of Bush's speech to the Urban League  and tell me what you think.

      I'm receiving an increasing number of political spam email these days, urban legend spew that inevitably gets started by  urlLink freepers .  These whisper campaigns can be devastating, and they are difficult to stop.  But, because they are a grassroots attack, the best way to stop them is at the grassroots level.  In other words, it's not a bug, it's a feature. ;)   Freep-mail also present a GREAT opportunity to set the record straight, get the facts out to people who are clearly misinformed, show up the GOP thug tactics for what they are, and hone our own research and communications skills.   What to do when your friends send you lying email   1.  Find the lies Debunk the email with the sources listed below.  2.  Send it back Send it back to the originator, and copy his/her list.  3.  Pass it on If you have friends interested in progressive politics, send the email to them, too. Odds are high that they are receiving the same whisper campaigns, too, but they may not know where to go to debunk the lies.  4.  Blog it! Post to the blog.  For example, Neil wrote an excellent debunk on an email we got about social security this week that I'll post separately.

      Via  urlLink BOP News :  The  urlLink Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , aka the DCCC or D-Trip, is hosting an  urlLink Open House Week  through their blog,  urlLink The Stakeholder , to discuss "everything from candidate recruitment and promotions to our role as a consultant in bringing grassroots support and enthusiasm to races across the country."  Call me a geek ;) , but I'm looking forward to learning more about how the DCCC operates.  I'm adding  urlLink The Stakeholder  to the  urlLink C101  blogroll for everyone's convenience.

      I saw this poster on the weekend at the Harrison St Coffee Shop here in Richmond.  Positively brilliant.     The Facts   George W. Bush won Virginia by 8% of the popular vote in 2000.   Bush won 52% of the Virginia popular vote, Gore got 44%, and Nader 2% in 2000.   47% of eligible Virginia voters didn't vote in the 2000 election.   26% of registered Virginia voters did not go to the polls in 2000.   Virginia carries 13 electoral college votes. Bush got 5 more than Gore in 2000.   You have until October 4th, 2004 to register to vote in the presidential election in Virginia.   VA registration forms can be found HERE or at your local post office, library, and DMV.   Election day is Tuesday, November 2nd, 2004.    Download the poster, buy the poster, or get code for the ad, from the good folks at  urlLink 8percentva.com / urlLink Another Limited Rebellion Design --and spread the word.

      In  urlLink the trailer for Ray , the new biopic feature on Ray Charles with Jaimie Foxx, here is a great scene where Ray is getting harassed in a dance hall for mixing up gospel and blues music:  Man:  You're turning God's music into sin.  Woman:  All y'all are goin straight to hell.  Ray:  If all y'all want me to keep playin, let me hear you say Amen.  Dancehall crowd:  AMEN. We saw the trailer at the theatre this weekend.  Neil leaned over and said, "We need to teach the Democrats to say AMEN."    And he was dead right.    Unless there's a revolution (god bless Joe Trippi), it may take a lot of time and work and a lot more money before the mainstream media in this country are anything other than rent boys for the GOP.  And we can't wait for the magic day to get our message across.  When the media, or the GOP attack dog surrogates, make outrageous claims, twist the questions, cut off the answers, throw reality to the wind and spout their made-up numbers and their bogus bought-and-paid-for PR firm generated science--we need to get the people to say AMEN.    What Ray Charles did in that scene was brilliant.  And it's what Pierre Trudeau did.  And it's what Winston Churchill did.  And Mae West.  And Oscar Wilde.  And undoubtedly American politicans of previous generations -- I'm just too new here to know who there were, and I don't see them around us today.  Ray Charles shifted the paradigm; he was quick and witty; he didn't fall into guilt and apologies; he was hampered by crippling "niceness"; if he turned the other cheek it was his butt cheek.    He didn't engage, he didn't debate, he took no prisoners.  He controlled the situation and he made the absurdity of the attackers a laughing stock.  And he let the people be his supporters and defenders by letting them in, by being with them, by knowing the answer before he asked the question, by making it clear who the cool kids were.    How do we teach the Democrats to say Amen?

      There was a great article in Harper's recently entitled "Liberalism regained: Building the Next Progressive Majority." I couldn't find this article online, but it was a great read. My favorite quote of the feature came from Ralph Nader:  Nader: But [the liberal community's] message is also missing somehting else: the emotional content, in the best sense of the phrase. One of the reasons is that liberals aren't good haters. Wheareas the agents and apostles of the right, they really are haters.  My immediate reaction was internally uproarious laughter. Did Nader just call the Republicans haters? Thank God. Somebody needs to inform those suckas that they bout to get served, and Nader seems like a worthy candidate.  Which is not to say that I prefer him over Kerry, but despite the fact that he's siphoning away votes, you've got to respect the man for what he represents. Nader is not afraid to wear his liberalism on his sleeve. He and many others are trying to do what I think Shaula means when she says  urlLink "redefining the terms of the public debate."   One term the liberals in this article relied heavily on was the "reactionary right." I think this is most telling, and at the same time most disheartening. Many people support the Republican party because they have a clearly defined and vehemently upheld message and focus and purpose. However that focus fundamentally boils down to fighting off liberals and there attempts to change the government. Slashing taxes actually means cutting down on liberal government programs. Anti-gay legislation actually means attacking the social movements that surround the progressives in this country. The political right as it is defined today is fundamentally a reaction to the political left's desire for progress. However they are able to pretend to have tangible goals and messages and they flood the American public with these goals and messages using their influence in corporate media and political organizations.  On the other hand, liberals actually do have very credible and outstanding goals. True freedom and equality for all. Fair wages. Social justice. A cooperative and enlightened foreign policy. The problem is that liberals have been spending the past three decades running away from the label of "liberal" rather than projecting our message into the minds and consciousness of Americans. Polls show that the majority of citizens actually support progressive measures such as a living wage, yet for some reason the political climate always seems to be at an equilibrium somewhere to the right.  What does that all mean? It means that Liberals actually have a righteous policy focus. It means that Conservatives policy focus fundamentally relies on destroying liberal gains and blocking progress. If the Republicans didn't have the Democrats, their party would fall apart (or turn this country into a military state). Democrats truly have the better argument. Philosophically they should have an easier time arguing their rhetoric, yet we've seen the past three decades more or less dominated by a Republican executive branch.  I can't remember exactly who it was (I think maybe it was Chris Miller?) but someone at Campaign 101 urged us not to think of the Green Party as a group we had to work to steal votes from. Instead he described them as the far left wing of the Democratic party that we abandoned when we lost power to the reactionary right and told us it was our duty to bring those true liberals back into the Democratic party. I'm beginning to take that call much more seriously. In the 7th House district Eric Cantor is being contested by an Independent Green Party Candidate.  urlLink Dr. Brad Blanton  will have a ridiculous battle to fight to win over the 7th district, but the fact that he's fighting in areas that Democrats have long abandoned as hopeless is an inspiring sign.  It's a discussion worth having. Too often Democrats tend to disappear after elections. This gives me something to focus on whether Kerry's in the White House or not. Redefining the terms of the public political debate can't be won unless we progressives organize. In the time since LBJ, there has never been a greater opportunity for us to take back the political climate in America than this very moment. I'm so excited.  TheCarltone

      So I hear Alan Keyes, former GOP presidential hopeful, will be running for a Senate seat from Illinois against everyone's favorite rising star, Barack Obama. Now don't get me wrong, this nearly guarantees that Illinois will produce only the fifth black senator in US history, and that's good.  But I mean, come on! Alan Keyes!? Keyes criticized Hillary for running for Senate in New York and now he's doing the exact same thing in Illinois. However Hillary went to New York so that she could make a positive impact on that state and this nation. Keyes is running in Illinois specifically to stop Obama from reaching the Senate (But a Keyes victory seems altogether unlikely). Thus his campaign already smells of that familiar negative GOP funk.  Read the AP article  urlLink here .
