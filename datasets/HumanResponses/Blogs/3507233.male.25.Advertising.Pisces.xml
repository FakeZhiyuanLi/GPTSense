						   Tonight, at all costs, I will find the right words.  I will transform this humble computer into a metaphysical grinding stone.   I will put my hands to this wheel and spray words like sparks from this keyboard.   At all costs, this room will rain verbal fire from the ceiling.  At all costs, I will make it rain perfect points of light in here tonight. Tonight the walls will be painted with the shadows of ancient tribal dancers.  Tonight my roommates will crouch in awe on the other side of my door, peeking through the keyhole at my madness.  No matter what, tonight they will believe me finally, they will believe this madman, this awful scientist.  Tonight they will have to wear welding masks to enter this room.  It will be a swirling mass of stars in the air above this carpet tonight. Tonight, at all costs, no matter what. I will become possessed by this art.  My eyes will roll back to glowing white bulbs, my lips will turn blue and recoil from my terrible gnashing teeth..  Tonight my arms will give off smoke from working these keys. Tonight I will find the right words.  	 But first… I need a beer.  (To warm me up) I summon the ghost of Johnny Walker.  Show yourself  Nny! (Can I call you Nny?) It’s a full moon tonight, and I’m mad because this world doesn’t howl anymore. Howl with me Nny.  I demand the fetid corpse of Captain Morgan push his way through the floorboards.  That’s right, tonight being a ghastly heap of rotting pirate bones is de rigueur, as they say in the malodorous brothels of New Orleans.  It’s ok padre.   Come forth, cancer-ridden femur of the late great Bob Marley.  Hop into this room like the frenetic pogo stick that you are.  I will imbibe your Lethean doses… I’ll drink venom from a King Cobra tonight. Tonight, I am a whirling dervish, a gasoline soaked monk, that inexplicable toaster teetering on the ledge above the bathtub that mother washes baby in.  To see me tonight, will be like watching a train wreck on the back of a spoon.  You’re all going to have to see this.  and now, again, but this time in jive:   Tonight, at all costs, I will find da damn right words.

						   There is no good reason why I know any of the following:  1. Elephants have been found swimming miles from shore in the Indian Ocean. I can't imagine what it would be like to be a shark swimmin around, lookin for a decent meal, then, you look up..and BAM! A freakin elephant!!!  2. When two words are combined to form a single word (e.g., motor+hotel = motel, breakfast + lunch = brunch) the new word is called a "portmanteau." My favorite is John Madden's 'Calf'+'Ankle'=Cankle. Or The less classy 'Gunt' (you figure the two words on that one yourself.)  3. Snakes cannot blink. I figure their eyes must sting like crazy. Over the years I have met some people that I would describe as 'snakes' and they can blink, hell, look 'em str8 in the eye and they can't not.  4. The tip of a bullwhip moves so fast that it breaks the sound  barrier, the "crack" of the whip is actually a tiny sonic  boom.   5. Bamboo plants can grow up to 36 inches in a day.  That's incredible.  6. Vincent Van Gogh comitted suicide while painting Wheat Field  with Crows.       7. Those stars and colours you see when you rub your eyes are  called phosphenes, when you stand up too fast and nearly pass out, that's called "FattyFatFatitis".  8.  Shock treatment for epilepsy was once administered by  electric catfish. Afterwards, treatment for 'FeelingLikeAnAsspresy' was treated by epileptics going drinking.  9. The snapping turtle eats carrion (that's dead and decaying flesh), So police use them to find dead bodies. I feed on chicken wings, so restaurants use me to find a source of money for their kid's dental work.  10. The adult Electric Eel has enough electrical power that could power a house of about twelve hundred square feet. Henry Rollins once said that holding onto your morals in this day and age of ethical decay is like trying to hold on an electric eel. I remember Rob Zombie talking about some sic snuff film he saw about electric eels... now it kinda dawns on me what he was talking aboot.  Note to self: don't grab electric eels.  11. Back in 1920, the Russian transplant pioneer Serge Voronoff made headlines by grafting monkey testicles onto human males. Yeeeeeahhh, cuz that's necessary.  Hey, Serge, how's the cancer treatment comin?  Serge: "Oh..not bad,, but hey check this out.. MONKEY BALLS!!".   What the fuck is wrong with people.  Not to mention the monkeys, what are they supposed to scratch now?  12. The temperature in eastern Siberia can get so cold that the  moisture in a person's breath can freeze in the air and fall  to the ground. See, the way I see it, ventriloquists in easter Siberia could practice really hard, and maybe hit someone with snowballs just by saying 'SNOWBALL!!!".  13. Check this out, The Main Library at Indiana University sinks over an inch  every year because when it was built, engineers failed to  take into account the weight of all books that would occupy  the building. That's genius.   14. Twelve babies are given to the wrong parents every day. I know, it's surprising right? Yeah, the thing is, I went ahead and did a little research, and as it turns out, I'm actually your daddy. We'll discuss this in more detail later.  15. 27% of Western male college students believe life is "a  meaningless existential hell."  Myself included.    16. Every person has a unique tongue print.   17. There are approximately 2000 thunderstorms that are active at any given time which means that at any given time there are 100 lightning flashes. Kinda makes sitting there reading this gibberish seem pretty mundane doesn't it.    18. The Ramses brand condom is named after the great phaoroh  Ramses II who fathered over 160 children and a golden razor removed from King Tut's Tomb was still sharp enough to be used.   19. A group of crows is called a murder.  20. It only takes a male horse 14 seconds to copulate. So much for the 'size that counts' argument.   21. There are mirrors on the moon. Astronauts left them so that laser beams could be bounced off of them from Earth. These beams help give us the distance to the moon give or take a few metres.    22. Annual growth of WWW traffic is 314,000%. Oh yeah, but I forgot, I am a nerd cuz I work in the internet sector.  Yeah, right. www.seeyainforbesmagazine.com bitches.  23. Everyone believed in the Middle Ages--as Aristotle had--that  the heart was the seat of intelligence.   24. The dolphins that live in the Amazon river are pink. But not after you cook and eat them.  25. Women's hearts beat faster than men's. Some moreso than others.  26. 97% of all paper money in the US contains traces of cocaine. Also, 97% of all cocaine addicts contain traces of being morons.  27. The words "assassination" and "bump" are often credited as a couple of the nearly two hundred words coined by Shakespeard, but that's not true.  "Assassin" comes from it comes from the word "hashish" and relates to a small group of Muslim fanatics back in the 13th or 14th century who plied their members with women and drugs, then sent them out from their remote mountain hideout in either Persia or Afghanistan to assassinate rulers all over the Middle East who their leader didn't think were holding to the one true faith. These 'assassins' took hash before each assassination raid they went on.  28. Babies are born without kneecaps. They do not appear until  the child reaches 2-6 years of age.    29. In Michagan, USA, a man legally owns his wife's hair believe it or not. Pretty archaic eh? I know, it's not nearly so advanced as in Utah.  30. Shannon Hoon, the now-dead lead singer of the group Blind  Melon was a back-up singer for Gun's N'Roses on their Use  Your Illusion 1 CD.   31. Alexander the Great was an epileptic.   32. Al Capone's famous scar (which earned him the nickname  "Scarface,") was from an attack. The brother of a girl he had  insulted attacked him with a knife, leaving him with three  distinctive scars.   33. Sharks are immune to cancer, so smoke it up sharky.   34. Nowadays, 50% of all people who get married get divorced and that number is increasing.  Makes sense, from what I can tell, people are also getting increasingly more desperate by the year.   35. Tobacco kills more Americans (450,000) each year than alcohol, cocaine, crack, heroin, homicide, suicide, car accidents, fire and AIDS combined.   36. Two out of five husbands tell their wife daily that they love  them. Also, 4 out of 5 wives under labouring under the delusion that their husbands are mind-readers.   37. X-ray technology has shown there are 3 different versions of  the Mona Lisa under the visible one.    38. Electrical stimulation in certain areas of the brain can  revive long lost memories.   39. Vikings used the skulls of their enemies as drinking vessels. How hardcore is that?

						   No matter what they do, they can't put the nose back on the sphynx. After Amen meets Amen-Re, neither one could be perfect anymore. No super power. Nietzsche killed God, they couldn't bring him back like Lazarus.   You can't give Cleaver back the years he spent in prison. The Chateau D'if is a tourist site now. Now is gone the second after you say it.  Language will never be classical again. Why do I know language that I shouldnt.. Why can I say that there is an X-18 Scavenger with afterburners growing angrily in the night sky? Heavy, pregnant looking jets bearing phosphorus canisters slung at the belly.. above cold deserts, intermediate-range reconaissance jet aircraft equipped for intelligence ops with two side-slung 16mm cameras, one loaded with visible spectrum, one for low-frequency radiation.. a centre-mounted Homans infrared multispex serving as the dividing mark between sonar scopes designed to detect wave-motion deformities and capable of taking a precise photo of a factory merely from the residual heat of the building 4 hours after it has shut down. Each digital frame fed through a secure sat-link feed and Data Prossex Epsilon Coded for Biological Events under specific set perimeters defined as 'Crises'.    You can't take the piss out the pool.  You can't take back those things you said. You can't go home again.  I carry a stone everyday. Just one and people ask me what I'm building. I know that just one of you knows what I am talking about when I say I carry one stone everyday.  Diligent isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind. ... I wink from my porch and the Kerouac who doesn't even know yet that he's a writer sees me suddenly like an ancient sage.   It's cool tonight in Alabama.  You look tan tonight Griffin, I say with a chuckle. The old man has a camera with him and winds it now. He says, "The infrared photo is based on heat instead of light so anything warm is white and anything cool is black. Did you know that?" Ying and Yang you and I. Two sides to the strophe.  The chorus swaying from left to right and back again, perfectly mathematical but music being art.. it is unchained.  Are you on the boat now? It's what you take from it that matters.  The bounce effect.  It's the sport. The ritual of it. Hurton says that their eyes were watching God but it really depends on which set of eyes needs what doesn't it.  Blake says that we are ten thousand eyes in a dark forest and DaVinci says that the eyes are the windows to the souls. So why can't we find peace as  ten thousand souls passing foolishly by wooden monoliths? Because we found fire hypnotic maybe? Prometheun hubris?  I think maybe i am allergic to the question mark and would rather that it were upside down, a fish hook in the depths of a lazy river.  No catalyst.  No cata at all. I would rather fall like Keats, embalmed in a Group of Seven painting... Those sure would've been some good wings kiddo, sure wish you let me try them, I had my hopes up and felt fearless and I'm having trouble gettin back. Walking the ice with a candle and can find the shore.  The Catalysts of Monte Strophesco.

						   1.  I cried for two days when my hamster died when I was like 12 or something. and now that its out that i am a pussy, i better counteract that by saying that i like to drink beer and use chainsaws and hunt for animals and such. ARGHHH (pirate style)  2.  I think that girls make no sense at all. I'm pretty sure that they realize this, and that's what really bugs me. I think that girls make things happen and then call it 'fate'.  That's really dumb.     3.  My favorite numbers are 27, 8, and 10. In that order. It is a code that no one will ever figure out unless I tell them. I bet they could get the first two, but not the third... an no.. it isn't my password for anything so don't waste your time.  Fakkin buzzards.  4.  The funniest embarassing thing that ever happened to me was in grade school, grade 6. It was awards day and I was a bit of a browner, so I was gonna get a bunch of those little seals of merit.  I wore jogging pants back in those days and just as I was going to be called to stand up (the entire school is cross-legged in the gymnasium), I realized that there was a pair of underwear static-clinging to the inside of my jogging pant leg.  It was just starting to show at the heel.  I tucked it in and left the gym just as my name was being called.  I went to my locker and quickly put it in my locker.  There was one special ed kid in the hall who saw me and she smiled but didn't laugh and I thought she was cool after that and told anyone off who made fun of the snot bubbles that came out of her nose.  5.  I believe in god.  6.  I used to think that Nicole Kidman was the hottest of all of the Hollywood actresses., but now, I think she got her face bo-toxed or something, cuz her forehead doesn't move. Plastic surgery is retarded.  7.  I used to think that The Family Guy was hilarious.  Now, whenever I see it, I get this terrible feeling in my guts like something bad is happening.  I turn the channel so fast.  8.  I try really hard to understand what it feels like to be other people but I can't ever really do it.  The few dramatic experiences I have had in my lifetime effected me so deeply... and other people have been through so much more.. If I had to live through their lives, I think it would've killed me by now.    9.  I don't think that there is a single person outside of the corporation I work for who knows what I actually do at my job.  They might ask randomly, in passing.. or even convince themselves that they care what I do.. but I don't think that they really do.  I think that if I suddenly bought a house or a fancy car or something material that suddenly they would be all, "What do you do?".  In my head I will say, "Sorry, shoulda asked 6 months ago when it would've been sincere." but what I will actually say is whatever they want to hear because that will make them comfortable and that is mostly what they want.  10.  On the vote>>>>  Monday is the vote.  I have decided that I will vote after much internal debate.  I don't like the Liberals, I don't like the Conservatives, I hate the NDP, and voting for the Green Party is useless right now (realistically).  So, I've decided that the only way to guarantee solid leadership is to find a candidate that I think would be a good leader.  This means finding someone I know, because why would I want to form an opinion on someone I've never looked in the eye. Problem is, the people I feel know their politics enough don't have the media savvy to win the race.  Hence, I will be running for mayor of a small town.  I haven't decided where yet. Simcoe is a good town.  I like how tall the trees are on Norfolk. Tall trees in a small town smack of goodness to me.  However, I have also become very fond of Niagara on the Lake down here in St. Cats.  It's much smaller, but there is water which I feel I need and it is a beautiful place.  The drawback is that it is mostly older wealthier people who wouldn't so easily fall for my P.R. and Advertising campaign.  I am thinking that taking a personal interest in some non-profits in the area would be good for me.  Maybe in Simcoe too. Work both turfs and then launch when I feel the buzz is right.  In any case, I'm confident that I can win. My goal here, ultimately is to take control of the town in question to allow my choice of leader to run the place. I will big up them during my term and let them handle the decisions, pay them enough etc, and then when I run for the second term, finance their campaign as well, thereby eliminating my own leadership by my own hand.  In result, my choice of leader takes control and I retire to a lakeside (or field-side) home to spend my time fishing and writing and cooking etc.  Now that's a plan. I would like to implement it by the time I am 35.  That gives me ten years.    11. I dream about places that I have never been sometimes which is really odd because I didn't think that that is how the human brain worked. I thought dreaming was like housekeeping for the brain.. a mish-mash of stifled desires and organizing of loose thoughts.  But I dreamt of a cliff-top monastery above blue water and then when I did some research on it on google, I found an exact picture of the place i was in my dream thats fukt up.  Meteora.  I think maybe i must have seen a picture of it back in the day when I was hanging out at the Szokes place and martin's recent death sorta kickstarted that image in my head.  sorta bible meets family meets escape.  Like I need to believe that martin is at peace with god despite his shady life and super-depressing death.  I think I have unresolved guilt issues there.  I read Freud's Psychoanalysis last week and I think that I am more of a Jungian.  I am definitely NOT a Redfieldian.   12.  All I want is someone to believe in me.  That and a steady supply of tasty food. ... and beer.

						    Deconstruction.  A Story by Jack Adams.    ... and the uniform blueness of this sky was broken only by the bare wire framework of an incomplete greenhouse. There, in the middle of endless fields, under the rising summer sun, it looked as much like the ancient bones of some dinosaur as it did a greenhouse.  The ribs of some giant creature that no human had ever laid eyes on.   You could have believed that, except for the barn beside it.  In the barn we sat on old milk-crates eating sandwiches in wax paper, drinking coffee from chipped mugs, and smoking cigarettes. No one talks much at six in the morning.   Why do you do this kid?   I don't know. I have to I guess. I can't sleep. I can't stop.  Can't you just let it go? I hate to see you like this.    I don't think that I can.  There is something I have to find.  I just can't remember what it is.   ...tired already by eleven and the shovel is heavy. The old man circles around this two acre dirt lot on his golf cart. His name is Dino Bravo.  Yes, THAT Dino Bravo; The former wrestler.  He is old now, at least 70.  His skin is wrinkled and his eyebrows are out of control.  His knees are batterd and broken from years of slamming into wrestling mats so when he gets off the golf cart to scream at me, he walks towards me with the stangest gait.  He won't admit the fact that his legs can no longer work properly so he drags them stubbornly.  He gets to me and grabs my shoulder with his right hand.  My smartass smile at his walking problems is immediately replaced by a pained wince.  His hands are not broken and are strong enough to crush my shoulders.  He leans with his weight on me as he explains to me that I have to work harder.  That I have to shovel harder or he will most certainly pile drive me.  No.. I'm not joking.  Only, he has a thick accent and what I hear is "JAAAAHK! DARE ARE DOO ACRES OF DIRT DAT NEED TO BE SHOV-ELLLLD! JAAAAHK! (in my ear) YOU HAVE TO WORLK HAAARDER.. ,  He wears a large sombrero to sheild his wrinkled face.  He shakes his fist and screams at whomever is closest as he walks back to his golf-cart, "Work harder!, Work harder!"  I tune him out and daydream about girls while I turn the earth with my shovel.  I just dig harder. There are ten of us youngsters in the field today and by 2pm there will only be me, Cam and Nathan left. This is how it is everyday.  I can taste dirt in my mouth and my eyes sting from sweat.   I can see some kids in the next row talking to each other, making jokes about the old man... but you can see sweat dripping from their brows.. I can see their water bottles, empty already.  I can see them looking at their watches. I just shovel harder.  Are you sure you even want to find what you are looking for?  What if you find it and it isn't what you want at all?   That isn't a very optimistic thing to say.   Since when are you an optimist?  You could search your whole life for something and build your hopes up sooo high,  and then, when you find it, IF YOU FIND IT, it could be nothing like what you thought it would be.  Why put yourself through all of that?   Well, what would you have me do?  Sit here, doing nothing... waiting for some crystal of enlightenment to just drop from the sky onto my head?   The second cement truck is empty now.  The other kids have gone home.  The cement worker hierarchy is such that the older and more grizzly you are the higher you are on the pecking order for cement rakes and rubber boots.  This is important because the last cement rakes left are the oldest ones.  They each have micro-layer after micro-layer of cement on them that wasn't cleaned away properly at a past job site.  This is important because they are heavier.  Also, the wood is older, and should the rake break while you are spreading cement, it wil be your fault and Dino will grab you by the neck and send you flying out of the other workers way.  And without a rake, the only job left is to help Dino.  The boots are important because if you get ones that are too big they get stuck in the cement and are pulled from your feet.. and Dino sends you flying into a pile of rebar.  If they are too small, cement creeps over the tops of the boots and the lime begins eating holes into your skin, which really hurt later when you are in the shower and the sweat and dirt is running down your legs and into the little holes.  On this day, I have the oldest rake but good rubber boots.  My hands are hurting alot and the skin working off in places leaving only sensitive pussy spots.  It is at least 40 degrees inside this green house.  We took down the clear plastic on the walls to let a breeze through.. but it only moves the hot air around. The old guyz drink pepsis, spilling it all over their grey beards.  It would make me so sick, I don't know how they do it.       We finish the last of that cement truck and as we take a moment to ourselves to sit under the shade of the barn and eat our lunches, we watch as it roars of down the road.  A new SUV turns into the gravel parking lot.  We watch, chewing and drinking, and smoking.  The two Tony's pick olives from a jar with their dirty fingers.   A man steps out from the vehicle.  He is wearing new workboots, pleated green workpants and a green farm shirt.  The sleeves are rolled up neatly. He is wearing a gold watch and I can see the younger of the Tony's eyeing it as he walks by.    I just don't understand what you expect to get from this.   ...I'm busy right now, I'll talk to you later.   Busy? What do you mean you're busy? What are you doing?  .... Hello?  ... As the SUV pulls out of the lot we pick up our shovel.  We swear and talk about girls and spit into the dirt.   The older guys throw their pepsi cans into the troughs we will soon be filling with cement from the next truck.  This is one of the small victories of the cement worker on the wealthy businessmen who comission our company.  Of the finest houses, the casinos, the restaurants... the foundations are filled with the garbage of the cement worker.       My shirt and jeans are soaked through with sweat by seven pm and my stomach aches from hunger, but the sun is going down now and the air cools the sweat against my skin.  My eyes sting from sweat and I can almost taste the beer I will have in my hand by 9pm.  I keep replaying the same song in my head to block out the constant beeping of the laser level. I daydream about girls and sports.    Hey dude, do you want to get a beer down at the Blue?   Yeah, sure.  Just one or two though, I'm tired and I have get up tomorrow at quarter to six.   Yeah, Ok.  Can I come down and see the greenhouse tomorrow? I've heard its almost finished.   Sure. Sure.

						    I think maybe my very favorite painter is Gustav Klimt.&nbsp; Loads of people like him for his trendy, famous paintings like "The Kiss", but that is just the sort of Firt Year Girls Dormitory nonsense that&nbsp;turns my stomach.&nbsp; I prefer this painting titled "Medicine".&nbsp; It seems&nbsp;powerful to me.&nbsp; I would really like to see it in person... large on a wall.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that not only did someone imagine this image, but that by some incredible feat they managed to conjure it out of coloured oils and canvas.&nbsp; And conjure is the right word.  &nbsp;

						   That's it, then? That's the secret, grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow. You spent three days lying on a beach drinking rum.     I really like poetry a lot.  Which sorta turns my male stomach at the same time as being a brave confession. Here is what Rollins had to say on the topic: "The P word is poetry, and I don't like to use that word. I think poetry is for poets... cappuccino drinking beret wearing fake ass mustache having, striped shirt wearing, Velvet Underground adoring poets. Leaking, sniveling, moist clammy handed guys who can't get any. I just go up and express myself freely - that's what we call a euphemism for talking shit. When you title yourself, you immediately lend yourself to all kinds of pretension, especially in the poetry business. "I'm a poet", if someone said to me "I'm a poet" I immediately hate him, I'd say "You're a dick."   Regardless, I like poetry. Maybe it just needs a tougher name... like "Chainsaw-o-try" or "Piratery"   Some Piratery I enjoy lately:  Michael Ondaatje The Time Around Scars   A girl whom I’ve not spoken to or shared coffee with for several years writes of an old scar. On her wrist it sleeps, smooth and white, the size of a leech. I gave it to her brandishing a new Italian penknife. Look, I said turning, and blood spat onto her shirt.  My wife has scars like spread raindrops on knees and ankles, she talks of broken greenhouse panes and yet, apart from imagining red feet, (a nymph out of Chagall) I bring little to that scene. We remember the time around scars, they freeze irrelevant emotions and divide us from present friends. I remember this girl’s face, the widening rise of surprise.  And would she moving with lover or husband conceal or flaunt it, or keep it at her wrist a mysterious watch. And this scar I then remember is medallion of no emotion.  I would meet you now and I would wish this scar to have been given with all the love that never occurred between us.  A Toronto Home for Birds and Manticores    This city with sun spreading down the street could be fashioned a delirious herb.  When snows have melted how dull to find just grass and dog shit. Why not polemic bones of centaurs —remnants of a Toronto bullet, punishment for eating gladioli.  Luring animal fashions in these beasts will nerve the city, clog sewers, and giving them this head start we can establish once more a survival of the fittest.  This Room and Everything in It by Li-Young Lee  Lie still now while I prepare for my future, certain hard days ahead, when I'll need what I know so clearly this moment. I am making use of the one thing I learned of all the things my father tried to teach me: the art of memory. I am letting this room and everything in it stand for my ideas about love and its difficulties. I'll let your love-cries, those spacious notes of a moment ago, stand for distance. Your scent, that scent of spice and a wound, I'll let stand for mystery. Your sunken belly is the daily cup of milk I drank as a boy before morning prayer.   The sun on the face of the wall is God, the face I can't see, my soul,  and so on, each thing standing for a separate idea, and those ideas forming the constellation of my greater idea. And one day, when I need to tell myself something intelligent about love,  I'll close my eyes and recall this room and everything in it: My body is estrangement. This desire, perfection. Your closed eyes my extinction. Now I've forgotten my idea. The book on the windowsill, riffled by wind... the even-numbered pages are the past, the odd- numbered pages, the future. The sun is God, your body is milk...  useless, useless... your cries are song, my body's not me... no good ... my idea has evaporated...your hair is time, your thighs are song... it had something to do with death...it had something to do with love.  The force that through the green fuse drives the flower  Dylan Thomas       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The force that through the green fuse drives the flower Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees Is my destroyer. And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.  The force that drives the water through the rocks Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams Turns mine to wax. And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.  The hand that whirls the water in the pool Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind Hauls my shroud sail. And I am dumb to tell the hanging man How of my clay is made the hangman's lime.  The lips of time leech to the fountain head; Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood Shall calm her sores. And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind How time has ticked a heaven round the stars.  And I am dumb to tell the lover's tomb How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm.

						   1. I went and saw Spiderman earlier tonight.  I really liked it.  I think that maryjane is awesome.  That's why I suggested we smoke it before watching the movie. That's the problem with smoking herb before a movie in the theatre though: Halfway through you come down. But wow, mary jane.  All those red hairs.  2.  My Mary-Jane Haiku  I would rather be  alone on the moon with you then the world I know.  3. Here is a better haiku by the master, Taniguchi Buson.  The winter river; down it come floating flowers offered to Buddha.  4. Lyrics I like from Spiderman 2 soundtrack.  Artist: Dashboard Confessional  Song: Vindicated   Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  (Chorus) I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  (Chorus)  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current and let me slip away  (Chorus)  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...  5. On the weekend I was at a party and I watched as a bug flew into a glass of red wine.  I thought it poetic at first, the frailty of life etc.  but in retrospect, I think that that bug must have been really drunk. He had patterns on his back and my sister tried to squash him but I told her not to and she only flicked him drunken into the garden.  6. Drunk bug in the garden,    Baptized liver hardens    Embalmed.     The pattern on your back     Is a sight.    Enthralled,     Drunken Trilobyte.  7. Vindicate To clear of accusation, blame, suspicion, or doubt with supporting arguments or proof: “Our society permits people to sue for libel so that they may vindicate their reputations” (Irving R. Kaufman).  To provide justification or support for: vindicate one's claim.  To justify or prove the worth of, especially in light of later developments.  To defend, maintain, or insist on the recognition of (one's rights, for example).   8.    "But there is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're fighting for."     Author: Paulo Coelho

						   Politicians have families too. They rest their heads like you. and do  the things they do. They picture perfect people and place themselves in places and break themselves in places and hide the pieces off in spaces. Now, if I could I would peace back together races, Lease morale from the traces left undiscovered in oases. but this is all a dream.  The tiger in the wild has moments quiet and mild playful moments like a child Quite certainly a wonder of this earth. Like birth. or like an hallucination. just like all creation of the feral cerebral station. If I could I would find those tigers in the valley feed those hobos in the alley and box a round with crazy Dali. but this is not much ado to do it is all a dream.  Picture perfect places Dream of distant spaces of jungle valley chases of giant cats and flapping bats and tiny gnats I see rats and snakes and cars and brakes and bars and lakes. I see scars and fire, guitars and lyres, I see hashassins for hire.  Helmets with feathers  anchors and teathers sharks and seals and bark and wheels and sparks and fields and better. this is how the gears and fears and tears and beers  on the other side of mirrors are here. but they are just a dream. Perfect and serene Perfect and Perfect and Perfect and serene  The tiger  somewhere in between the picture and the perfect.
