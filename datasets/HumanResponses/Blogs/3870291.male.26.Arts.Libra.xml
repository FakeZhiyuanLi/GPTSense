      This will be a new ongoing feature here at "The Question?", wherein I quote a source of wisdom or foolishness of note.  By the way the new posting interface is much better on the eyes.  on to the quote.   "Bewildered by false documentation and unsure of whom to trust, we'll simply believe the images we want to believe - the ones that confirm our prejudices&nbsp;and&nbsp;ennoble our cause." -Daniel H. Pink on digital photo fraud.   &nbsp;  It was suggested in this months issue of WIRED magazine that "little Brother" watching (i.e. a digital camera in the hand of every soldier) could in fact&nbsp;be the&nbsp;Orwellian "telescreens" turned inward, and now letting the controlled survey the controller. However,&nbsp;due to the fudimental simplicity of modern photo editing (read: fraud) such images can sort of&nbsp;"double backfire" when real images are accused of being sensational fakes.  Food for thinkies.   What was the Question? &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Punk rock. The big one. I must admit even I have been very afraid to tackle this question. Afraid perhaps to look at myself, and the less than punk things I do/am. My qualifications to disertate on the subject of punk? I have read numerous legnthy (not just music based) books on the subject, as well as watched many documentaries, both on the music and the culture. Seen all movies about punk, and always clip news articles on the subject. I also read maxumum rock-n-roll, punk planet, and other more underground  periodicals that I wont bother to name (apkwiab!!!!!) I just might know more than you Mr. Mohawk leather jacket, spikey shorts. And then again I may not. One thing's for sure I know a hell of a lot more than the assholes at work. That's where the inspiration for this piece comes from, an argument at work about that age old question: is punk dead?  to quote the pist "this is a warning, no this a threat...as long as I'm alive then punks not dead yet!!!"    oh wolverine how could you?  today I suffered a blow from one of my favorite comic book characters. A sweeping and ignorant generalization on the "punks"; in the back ground of a panel. At first I was so pleased to see storm and Logan strolling down St. Marks place in NYC, but then came  wolvies comment and well...I was hurt.(I would love to just post a picture of the offending panel but I cant shrink the file enough so here is a transcription written by me, what ever you read in brackets like [this] is me talking)  Ultimate X-Men issue# 48 by Brian Vaughan   page.22   panel 1: we see a street sign "St Marks pl" NYC   Panel 2: Logan And Ororo [Storm, Halle Berry y'know] are walking down the street, if you've ever been to St Marks place in NYC you know what it looks like and its a pretty accurate scene.punk type people hanging about tattoo parlors and vintage store. I[I was psyched to see it]  STORM: thanks Logan. WOLVERINE: for what kid I aint said word one to you today.  panel 3:Logan and Ororo tight shot.  STORM: exactly.Ever since Hank died the rest of the team cant stop trying to...to fix me. WOLVERINE: Hey, you lost your one and only. Who am I to judge if that makes you wanna give yourself a dumb haircut and start dressing like  street trash ? [last issues cliffhanger was storm in her room with a pair of sisscors, her trade mark white locks having been hacked by herself into a "punk" look.  shivers!!!  what a startling development! Storm changed her look, OH NOOOOOO!]   Page.23  full page advert for the American dairy ascoc. featuring an NBA star with a milk mustache.   page.24   panel 1: Storm and Wolvie in another tight shot, different camera angle.  STORM: oh. WOLVERINE: You're not the first person life ever stomped on. Take a look around. [uh oh wolvies gonna talk shit about the punks!]  panel 2: Logan/Wolverine and Ororo/Storm are standing with their backs to the camera, in the background are three "punks", male. One has a short blonde mohawk and a goatee, chains and patches adorn his leather jacket, sneakers on his feet. The second man has a large liberty spiked orange Mohawk, and a vest over a short sleeve white t-shirt. There is a picture of George Washington [?] printed on the back of his vest. Spiked bracelet hangs infront of his fatigue style pants tucked into motorcyle boots. The third man is mostly obscured by the figure of Wolverine, but can clearly be seen to be bald [pidgon holeing violent skinheads with peaceful punks again are we, such a typical stereo type, Mr. Vaughan?]he wears a "{wife beater" tank top, and shorts and jack boots.Wolvie and Storm regard the punks.  WOLVERINE: All these pups [pups?] hurt so bad, they gotta push the world away, just to make sure it don't hurt'em again. But the only thing worse than bein'in pain is bein'  ignored , so they have to find a look that says, "everybody pay attention, just don't get too close."  panel 3: Storm and wolverine tight shot.  WOLVERINE: they like to think they're all  loners , but check out those get-ups, looks more like a  uniform  than whatever fancy crap the professor makes us-- STORM: Logan you are the oldest, grumpiest young man alive. [storm goes on in the next panel to take a shot at wolvie saying "I'm not the only one around here with a stupid haircut, but that's immaterial]  So there you have it...WHERE DO I BEGIN? First of all, let me just say that all that crap came from a guy dressed Exactly ("X"-actly..Ha, Ha, I pun.) like Arthur Fonzerelli better know to TV viewers as the beloved Fonzie from Happy Days. Hey Wolverine, as long as you're gonna knock my image, Lemmy from MotorHead called...He wants his side burns back. Seriously, the ficticious (don't think that fact had escaped me)character of Wolverine is not usually written so one dimensionally. usually he is a smart and cunning super hero, judges nobody and never would due to his sorrid past. MR. Vaughan I don't blame you for voicing an opinion, but I feel more like this was a hurtful and ignorant prejudice spilling out from a writer onto the pages of one of my favorite comic books, through a favorite character no less. Before I get into how utterly irresposible that was, let me just address how wrong Mr. Vaughan is. Lets go in order. Wolvies first comment, about how "these pups been hurt so bad" ok. While it's true that the punk community may be comprised mostly of individuals who may have had a hard time fitting into other social venues, we are not all abused and abandoned. True some are, but the overwhelming majority, are well adjusted kids, who come from loving and supportive homes, and just happen to have an unusual taste in fashion and music. Most aren't "Pushing the world away" were just creating our own world. Creating as in "CREATIVITY"! Sure punks are in general an angry bunch, but what kid with half a brain wouldn't be angry in our mixed up world? For that matter what Teenager at all isn't angry about SOMETHING? Instead of gangs, or crime, punks chose to express their anger through healthy outlets like music, self published "'zines" and comics among other things. EXPRESSION...CREATIVITY!!!  which brings me to the second comment. I AM SO SICK OF THE UNIFORM ARGUMENT!!!!! Ever since the movie "SLC Punk" (in which the main character  admits  he is not a punk but a poser in the end.)I have had to have this argument with every hack music buff, co-worker, family member, and anyone who asks me about my green hair. NO IT IS NOT A FUCKIN UNIFORM. YOU ALL NEED TO LOOK UP THE FUCKING DEFINITION OF THE WORD UNIFORM!! At this point I would like to point out that the Three punks in the panel of X-Men ALL WERE DRESSED DIFFERENTLY! While it may be true that there is a look to punk (actually punks themselves can discern between many  different  punk looks that connotate interests in various sub-catergories of the genre). That has never been the main focus of the culture. What the main focus of the culture  is  is a matter for another article, but I will say that culture is the operative word here. Every culture has a look, that's part of what "Culture" is, although that's very easy to forget since America has no culture really (being such a relatively young country). African Americans may wear traditional robes to express their culture, this is NOT a uniform and if you told them such you're likely to meet with some negative response. Sieks wear turbans on their heads, this is Not a uniform. Football players from the same team all wear the SAME color pants,SAME helmet, SAME jersey. This IS a uniform. The cultural garb of certain religions or countries or even "punk rock" have so many different colors, styles, and patterns that if it was a uniform for a sports team or an army, that team would lose and those soldiers would get killed. They wouldn't know who to pass the ball to, or who to shoot at. While at first glance it is easy to identify, a tribal African, or a Hindu, or even a punk, upon closer inspection you can wee how rich the culture in question truly is. CLOSER INSPECTION, learning, not ignorance, not lumping all of one group into neat little piles. Punk fashion is extremely expressive. In the army you must wear your buttons(badges) just-so. Punks put'em wherever the hell they want. Paint this bit of leather, put spikes here, pierce this or that, Hair:pink:green:purple:WHATEVER. Try doing that to your "uniform" in the army and you'll be court martialed fast. In conclusion IT IS NOT A UNIFORM. Just because it is an identifiable fashion related to a specific minority, doesn't make it so, and calling it such is borderline hateful and certainly foolish. The punkest thing I ever saw was this: at a Conflict (punk band) concert most if not all of the audience were adorned with professionally dyed mohawks, leather jackets covered, every inch, in spikes and studs, $100 bondage pants, you know. And here's this skinny little kid with long bushy mop hair (natural color) wearing converse, striped socks, tattered shorts and a plain white T-shirt upon which he had written this in sharpie: "I have a mowhawk on the inside." THAT'S FUCKIN PUNKROCK! THAT'S the kind of culture we are. That boy, though I never got his name, will always be remembered by me as the punkest mo-fo to walk the planet. MR. Vaughan you see, we don't "all look alike" as you like to think. I(I only wonder now if you think that inner city black, or Asian people "all look alike") Punk is a beautiful and creative(I cant stress that enough) culture, created in America embraced now by the world. Your thoughtlessness and  ignorance to that fact are enough to make me stop buying your comic book, and urge my peers to do so as well. And as far as "wanting attention" goes, yeah I suppose we do. Who doesn't? Like other minority cultures and lifestyles such as Gays, Blacks, intelligent people, we have opinions, we have a voice, and we would like them to be heard. My hair isn't green because I want you to stare at me, my hair is green because  I like it that way.  You have a resposibility, since there is no disclaimer on the cover of your book stating otherwise I assume it is marketed to comics main demographic...KIDS! I would warn that you be careful what you put into impressionable minds sir, America has enough hate and ignorance without you and Marvel adding to it with such a popular soapbox as "Ultimate X-men". Shameonyou. AND  up the punks!!! What was the question?

      Well its finally happened, the UNTHINKABLE!!! I broke my ps2. While trying to fix a problem that developed I accidentally pierced the control port ribbon, and BINGO...My ps2 pooped the bed. Sucks too, because I just bought Spider-Man 2 and was only just starting to get into it. If anyone has a control port ribbon to spare (or for sale) let me know. Speaking of Spider-Man 2, I saw the movie, and Damn it kicked ass. That's pretty much the universal feeling from most reviews, and people I've talked to. However, there is a small percentage of people that did not like this movie. I know, I know...Why? For me the flick would have stood up just as much even without the super heroics, the Story was THAT good, Christ I almost cried for poor Peter Parker (my girlfriend DID cry, and she doesn't even LIKE comics!)it was touching well written and a blast in the action department. Well exceeded my expectations for Spidey2 and summer blockbusters in general. don't know why anyone wouldn't love this movie, except perhaps...No, nope, no clue. so here I sit writing in my blog instead of doing my chores around the house (anything to avoid housework). When Heather (my girlfriend and bestfriend, and roommate) gets home its "go" time. Laundry (our combined complete wardrobes)and dishes and cleaning...We're slobs, oh well. I'm rambling. SO that's it for now. I promise to write an article soon about recent "Bleakest2" developments. Oh and check out my friend blog  urlLink here  and choke on it.  POST A COMMENT DAMN IT!!!!!

      I am a DJ...Which means "D.isk J.ockey" which means I press play, or put a needle in the right grove. And its time for me to say that a monkey could do my job. Ok there, I've admitted it. Its actually a very fun and well paying job. I meet all kinds off cool and uncool yet interesting People, network and social climb, but just like anything else it has its drawbacks.   Know what I hate? The guy who begs and begs you to play "zoot suit riot" so he can show off his $19.95 per lesson swing dance skills to some dumb sorority girl that he just met. And when you do play it he dances; trying awkwardly to swing this chick through his legs and you know she's too drunk to do the freakin macarena, but on they cavort making fools of themselves. A circle forms around these idiots, a circle of other idiots cheering them on. It never fails, Whenever I play "Rappers Delight" some moron will ( with varying degrees of success) try to do the worm on the filthy beer soaked floor and the other drunken fools will hoop and holler and form that retarded circle of shame. Stop asking DJs to play "pour some sugar on me" we HATE it, and NO you're not the first person to ask for "kiss me deadly" (another song that I   used   to love.) When I play five rock songs then switch to rap, don't come up and ask for another rock song...You missed your window. here's how it works. If you want to here your song, provided that it fits somewhat into my night and isn't completely wack (like say Johnny cash's cover of hurt at 2am on Saturday night) have dollar in hand. If you want the song   next   five bucks'll do it. Lets say you REALLY want to here Johnny sing "hurt" or some other song that just doesn't fit into the format of a club at prime time on the weekend (like foo fighters or something) twenty bucks'll pretty much get anything you want to hear played. I'm a whore, I can admit it, for a 20 spot I'll play the freakin hokey pokey, and YES I do have it. When a DJ tells you he doesn't have a song, he or she is probably lying because he doesn't want to play it. Go to the club armed with this knowledge and your wallet and a healthy respect for the monkey pushing play that we call the DJ...And all will be right in your world. What was the Question?

      So here it is, too cheap (read:poor) to spring for a real website, so I got me a crummy blog. (like my grammar?) "Blog"...Even the name is crummy. Why couldn't they call'em Blinks, or Blips, or even Blots for christs sake? No "BLOG". Sounds like a bodily function one executes after a night of drinking. "Yeah I woke up after Jimmy's party a bit hungover." "OH yeah? Did you have to BLOG?" originally I was going to take my zine online and call this space "F-Minus" but that name was taken, and I'm sick of it anyway. I'll still write my little zine, and I'll try to republish parts of it here for my friends, contacts, potential employers, whoever actually might read these things..."Blogs"...Why not just call them cyberspew? That's what they are after all, in a fashion. MY NAME IS MATT KUBINSKI. I write comic books, and screenplays, and make my living working for a company called the lodge management group, DJ-ing and working the door and as a barback in one of the many clubs they own here in Chicago. To date I have one finished (professional)project that I am very proud of. "The Bleakest" is a film that I wrote, produced, and stared in with the help of my good friend Charles Klien the director of said project. It is 10 minutes long, and available to watch at WWW.ifvchicago.com where it won second place in their film festival(look under short films, the Bleakest). I am currently shooting the second chapter, and its all going quite well thank you. That isn't to say that there haven't been some bumps in the road; booms in shots (that's when you can see the microphone for all you laypeople out there) general fatigue in actors (Get some sleep guys) and bad sound guys, it happens. (Marty you're fired!!! No I kid.) But all things considered its all to be expected on a film shoot, and part of the challenge. One of the actresses in part two of my little story can be seen in  Spider-Man 2!!!!!  For exactly 2  count'em 2  seconds. But she's in there...Cool huh? I am also working on a comic now called "Superbia" (copyright '03 Kubinski. All rights reserved! So don't even think it bucko'!!) Which is basically about a small town inhabited mainly by super heroes and their families. Think JLA meets Married With Children meets Copland meets American Beauty meets As The World Turns meets my keyboard, and you pretty much got it. Superbia is a dark situation comedy as serious as it is silly. Once you read it you'll agree. HOW CAN I READ IT MATT? OH HOW EVER CAN I? You cant. not yet. Currently Superbia is being looked at for publication by GeekPunk comics (the guys who gave you "Super Hero Happy Hour). I'll keep you posted...Literally. well I think that's long enough for the first entry. Keep focus, DO what you do, and what was the question?
