      I have been playing around with this site  all morning . I worked on a new template I really like, but of corse the blogger banner at the top shows through it! Looked like shit!  Maybe I should just buy the name witchymom? It is open if I use .net? I don't know?  Why am I never happy with what I have?  Maybe that would make me happy? $25.00 is not that much money, if it makes me happy. I was happy with my lazydaze.net but I had to tell people about it! I'll never do that again. I don't know????  I am 85% sure I will purchase the name!  so if you have me linked I am sorry! What a pain in the ass I am!! This will be my last move, I promise!!!!!!!!!! Okay, so that sounds like I know what I am doing, huh?  K, I am getting out the credit card and being done with it! I'll post a link here in a couple of days when I have it all set up.

      Well the party is over, and I am still alive. Its is 8:30 in the morning and there are only 3 girls left in the living room. My husband is out with his brother fishing and I am a happy computing girl!  My daughters party went good.  There was lots of food, dancing,yelling, singing and laughing.  The living room was rocking till midnight.  I will have pictures up of both weekends on Tuesday.  This is such a reminder that I  need  a digital camera!  Now!

      My daughter Bethany is sixteen today! I can't believe she is sixteen! How did that happen? I am I that old?  Na   Well we had our family party last weekend for both girls. This weekend I let Bethany plan a party with her friends.  We planed an all night outside bash. Boys to leave at 11:00pm and girls can sleep over. With BBQ, teiki torches, music and a screen tent.  Ofcorse we have rain and storms for tonight!!! So, last minute we decorated the living room and kitchen, it looks so cool. She picked out star shaped colored lights and a disco ball to go with her friends karioki machine( iam sure my spelling is wrong). So my house right now is filled with teenagers and loud music and tons of food.  I am such a cool mom.( pats self on back)  My parents never let me have a party like this,  I had to sneak when they were out of town.

      My daughter and her boyfriend have broken up twice now. Once a couple of weeks ago, which totaly broke her heart! She took it so hard, after spending that weekend crying, shopping, eating ice cream, and lots of girl talk, they got back together. This time just a few days ago, he broke up with her again, she seemed sad but said " I am not doing this again mother"  Well, last night the poor girl called me to come pick her up from her best friends house, she was crying so hard she couldnt breath. Steve has a new girlfriend already!! I thought he loved me, how can someone say all those things and not mean them???? Wow, I am so not prepared to be the mother of a 16 year old girl!!!!!!  Than see let out,and after I had sex with him! I love him. Wow, I am sooo not prepared for that ! I think Isaw stars? Not that I am stupid .  I am still pretty young, it hasnt been that long sence I was a teenager.  The little rat didnt even break up face to face, or tell her about the other girl himself. This is how she found out on instant messenger: Bethany: logs on The Rats Best Friend is on and says: Hi Bethany: Hi, ( knowing he has only I.M.s her when Steve is there with him)  Bethany: is Steve there ? The Rats Best Friend: No, he's out on his bike with his new girlfriend. Bethany: What? The Rats Best Friend: Ya, shes cool like that. The Rats Best Friend: Shes from Taylor. ( a hick town near us) Bethany: I gotta go The Rats Best Friend: Why? Are you going to cry? Bethany: Why would you tell me stuff like that , that makes me feel like shit?  The Rats Best Friend: You are shit. The Rats Best Friend: Bye Shit  She can't understand how someone she thought was a friend could be so mean!  I feel so bad for her, being the mom it's so hard to see your daughter learn that the world can be so hard!  I better not catch either of those little shits crossing the street in front of my SUV !

      My office is like a ghost town today. Three out of five are not in. So when I am not busy what do I do? What you do? Compute? YEP! I started a new blog, not just another blog about my boring life. A movie blog! I have been thinking about this for a while and not had the time. I named the site  "Sofa Reviews " I still have a lot to work on it, but I plan on writing a little review on movies as I watch them from my living room. I added comments so that anyone reading can agree or disagree. Sounds fun huh?  urlLink Check it out!

      Thats all I have been doing for the past week is getting ready for our girls birthday BBQ. Well it's over, maybe I'll have a little extra time to spend computing ??? Huh..we'll see. The party went great! The sun was a little hot, but we had NO rain, here in Michigan thats getting lucky lately. Everyone showed up and our house and yard was full of good food, laughs and lots of family!  It was so nice to spend the day with all my parents, and my sister came who I have really been missing lately. I have the best family!  My dad's birthday is Monday so I included him on the girls cake, it read : Happy Birthday Allison 4 Bethany 16 and Grandpa 60 It was too cute, and gave him a smile!  I should have a few picturs up my Tuesday.

      Allison had her first Cheerleading class last night. It was one of the cutest things I have ever seen! She is the smallest one in the class, the thinest, and one of the loudest!  Her arms and legs look so long while they streched, jumped, and cheered. It was so funny. But I was a little bummed that they didnt have a uniform small enough for her, so I have to find a sports store that can order one. My little string bean had a great time and can't wait till next week!

Well Saturday is our family BBQ for both of them, one turning 4 and one sweet 16.  Wow do I feel old saying that !  I can't believe how fast the time is going by, we still have alot of work to do around here inside and out in the yard before the party. I am so not prepared!  and of corse my husband is working lots of over time and is like a walking zombie, poor guy. I feel so bad for him.  This will be our first BBQ sence putting up our fence, I am so excited. oh, the little things in life...

It was not an easy thing for me to do, hitting the "YES I WANT TO DELETE" button! I spent a lot of time building urlLink  that site , and turned out great! but I really don't have the time to update it anymore and why spend the money every month? Time to let go and move on.

      Don't ya just love that feeling when you run into an old friend that you think about often but not seen in a long time? Thats what happened to me this morning. I was standing in line at the gas station waiting to buy my healthy Hostess breakfast when I heard him call me.  We were great friends for over 7 years, which is about how long it's been since we saw each other. What a great way to start off a Monday morning! I can't wait to get together and do some catching up on each other.

      Welcome to my world.  I started blogging about a year ago. I love it! But I did what a lot of other people have done, I told a few friends and family about my site and now here I am starting another blog so I can feel free to write about anything and not worry about who is reading it. That is why we start these things isnt it? Live and learn I guess.

      I don't understand, but my entry on being pregnant is gone! I am glad I got to read the comments before it went!  I read I think 5 really nice comments. Strange?  Well for those of you who stop by here once in a while,  this Witchymom is adding one more to the coven! Yep, I am pregnant!  I am starting to get use to the idea, besides the fact that we gave away ALL our baby stuff and have to start over. Those of you who have children know how much stuff we will be buying over the next 6 months.  Those who don't have any yet, let me tell you. Its a LOT of stuff!!!!

Speaking of this weekend...I am taking my daughter to  urlLink Cedar Pointe.  My husband is going with us this time for his first visit,  he's never even been on a coaster!

I also want to thank everyone for all the comments and emails full of support after my "Last Evening" entry!!! I am so lucky to have so many wonderful friends here on the net!

      I can only try to tell you how I felt taking my daughter to the doctors office for birthcontrol. Does this visit to the doctor make me a good mom or a really bad mom? Is what I kept asking myself. I am not ready to be a grandma before I am even 40 was my answer, and more importantly her a mother! The girl is in no way ready for a sexual relationship! She cant even take care of her cat, for crying out loud!!  I wish I could shout "just dont do it" and she would listen, but I know thats not reality.  I am glad that she was open enough with me to tell me her and her boyfriend had sex for the first time, and I am very glad the her first Gyno visit was with our family doctor that she has seen before. But sitting there while the docotor asked her questions and told her everything she was doing made feel like crying. When she told me all the STD's she is testing for, I truley thought I would pass out! We did end up with a perscription for the shot. That way there is no forgetting to take a pill or change a patch.  The whole thing has broken my heart in a way I cant explain.  It's not that I thought my daughter was any kind of angel,  far from it, but reality can just hit so heavy.  I dont think I have ever been so tired as I was last night when I got home.

      Are we sure it's Monday already? I don't feel like I had a weekend yet! I cant believe how crappy my weekend was. I thought I would have all this time Saturday while my hubby was out fishing, but things just didnt go my way. I hate that! I planned a lot of computer time. I did get a little, but a little is just never enough!  Today I am taking my 16 year old daughter to the doctor to put her on the birth control shot.  I just want to go back to bed and pretend that it's not happening.  I can't believe she is old enough for such things! I want to say she's not, she's just a kid!  BUT, I am not one of those parents who thinks "just say no or dont do it" is the answer.  I was 16 not that long ago and know the kinds of things that were going on.  She has had the same boyfriend for a full year now. They were in love, broken up and now in love again.   Oh....my goddess, I think I need a drink?  I will most likely cry all the way home from the doctors office.

      I think I fell in love with my husband all over again last night! He finaly said those seven little words I have been waiting to hear for years. "Okay, honey we can get a dog"  My heart did flip flops. I am sooo excited.  Because the  urlLink puppy I want  is so expensive, our plan is to try for X-mass. That gives me enough time to save some money and maybe make a few extra bucks somewhere. What a Christmas our daughter will have if it works out that we can hide him from her until morning! I have spoke to three breeders over the past week who are trying to have a new littler ready by the end of the year. I am sooo excited, its like being pregnant again !  I am finaly going to have my little boy pup!

      We had such a great weekend, we went boating,  urlLink fishing , swimming, beaching, and saw  urlLink fire works on Lake Huron.  It really was a nice three days. Allison was so well behaved the whole time. The last few times she has gone with us, she did a lot of crying and didnt sleep much, this time she slept till after 10:00am everyday, it was great!  I have to say she didnt care for the  urlLink 7 & 1/2 hour car ride  on the way up there, but neither did my and dad.  Happy Hump Day !

Grow your own produce or buy from supermarket/greengrocer/farm stand?  Farmstand if I can, but I live in the city, so it's the supermarket for me.  9. Drive with car windows/top down, or with air-conditioning on? AIR CONDITIONING!   10. Go away for vacation, or stay at home?  A little of both.

      I hate it that my daughter is so much like me! Selfish, moody, mouthy, boy crazy, and such a drama queen. ( until I was about 21 )  The girl is just plan nuts at times!  Sometimes I don't know how my parents got through it? She and her boyfriend have spit up, got back together, and split up again. Last weekend he had another girl friend and they would  never  be back together, this weekend she is missing our family getaway for the fourth to spend time with him!  I can't keep up!!!! Ofcorse when I mention making her go,  Her head spins around and she spits what looks to be pea soup at me!  Did I go on any up north trips with my parents when I was 14, 15 or 16 ?  No, but that's not really the point.  right?   Someone, please give me something to get through these next couple of years before the girl kills me!!!!!!

      My four year old daughter has been talking a lot about magic lately. Mom I can do magic, I really can, I can do magic ...and so on... Finaly after hearing this for  hours  yesterday,  I ask "okay Allison what magic can you do?" She answered me with a  huge  smile on her face..  "see this cookie" she says,  "I am going to eat it and  wala  it will turn to poop".  "Thats magic right? right mom? real magic" She was so proud of herself.  I was speachless!

      I have been so busy lately with all this house and moving stuff that I havent been on the computer much. This morning I got the chance to read all my links. I just love the new layout over at  urlLink Just Rilana !  Simple and very nice!  I love the template I am using when I am on  my  computer, but at work it's just too dark.  When ever  I have the time I think I need to work on my own simple but personal look.  I miss doing my own layouts, being creative. Who knows when I'll have the time, not for a while.

      Wow, is it really Saturday? Well our house is going on the market in  two  weeks. I am supose to be cleaning out the kitchen today, getting it ready for showing, but I think I need a day off before I work that hard. Then I have two whole days to scrub things down and fit in some outside play with Allison.  I cant believe all the work around here my hubby is going to try to fit in two weeks, also working 12 to 14 hour days at work for the next month. I am feelling stressed just thinking about it! I cant wait for this whole thing to just be over with, and we are in our nice new house!  House? Thats going to be hard, do we want a much bigger and much nicer house in the same area? or a little bigger than we have in a much better city??? I think we'll end up in the better city? but its a hard one.  I don't hate the city we live in, I grew up here. But I think the next city over would be the better investment.   We know it would!  I don't know, the whole thing just makes me stress.  Maybe I should hit the couch for a while with chips and Pepsi, that might help?

      We have been so busy with realtor stuff, I havent had time for much else. So far we like the house we looked at, but don't want to count others out just yet. I just don't want to regret the one we pick because we didnt look around any.  Our realtor believes we will get an amount we are very happy with for our house, after one thing, we have to replace the furnace! What a job that will be for my hubby.  Thanks for all the comments on this layout,  I am going to try to tweek it a bit when I have the time.  Lets see... what else over the past three days, I am finaly starting to feel a little better, less sick. This morning I felt the new whitchybaby wiggle a little bit for the first time! That was cool ! Not  much more has been happening but, houses, houses and houses. so I am off to read up on my blogging buds before my luch time is over.

      I am getting some nice emails and comments on this new layout. Thanks! But I am wondering, if it looks too dark? The type? When checking it out at work today, I had a little trouble reading it? Let me know how it looks on your end please? Maybe I'll make a couple of changes as soon as I get a chance?  Speaking of changes, we have our appointment set for tomorrow evening about the new house! I can't wait! I really want this to work out!  Hope everyone is having a Happy Monday !

      It has been some weekend so far ! Of corse everyone knows of the huge  urlLink black out  that included us here in Michigan. It was so hot I felt ill most of the day yesterday. I feel so bad for all the people who had it  much  worse than me!  The elderly, sick and people who were stuck in elevators, and subways.  But I still managed to do my share of bitching in the afternoon high heat.  Today we found out we just may be moving after all  and soon .  A house we were once very interested in is back on the market, so we called did some talking and are going to check it out and all the details Monday or Tuesday evening. The realtor thinks it's very doable. It would be so great if we are in it right away and have lots of time to get ready for the new baby!!! Cross your fingers for us, I really want this one! We plan on doing a little work to the house we are in, but not a lot so it will maybe sell faster at a lower price? I know if it is ment to be, it will be. I hope it's what the Gods and Goddesses have planed for us :) Did I mention the big double size yard it has for BBQ's and get togethers ?????  Or how the master bedroom has it's own bathroom???  Okay enough, I am getting my hopes way too high.

      I had my first OB appointment yesterday, and even saw an early ultasound of the new Witchybaby. Heart pumping, blood moving and everything.  Yep, it's real!  So, now that I know everything is okay....time to shop!   This Saturday morning my 16 year old daughter and I are following a map of a dozen yard sales in the area in search of some good baby deals. Should be fun.  I guess I havent had a lot to write about lately, all I want to do is sleep! I hope to back to feeling like myself soon!

      Wow, I cancled my  urlLink Charmed  site over four months ago and Yahoo still has it upand running. In fact people are still signing my guestbook and adding links everyday!  I was so proud of that site, how popular it became in such a short time. I guess I did pretty good? I really do miss working on it, being creative almost daily. It was a lot of fun! Maybe when Yahoo lets go of the name, I'll snag it up again for one more season?  I don't think the show is going to last more than that anyway? Who knows?  I really don't have the time like I used to keep it updated, will see?   I think I am just being a little hormonal. I've been a little more emotional all day. I am really missing my  urlLink sister!  We were so close, now with our busy lives we arent together or even talking a whole lot these days. I sure hope things move around again, because I really do miss her.  By the way I am starting to feel pregnant.  Today at work I had to leave to go buy some Saltines in the morning. Not fun! I want this over with already.  Ha...  I have a long way to go!!!!!

      How do you make a hungry pregnant receptionist work their fastest? Put a cheeseburger and fries on their desk, when she has work to finish before taking a lunch break.

      Well, I am dressed this morning for the first time sence being home from the hospital. Feels strange! Empty, not right. I can't help but feel wrong, like somethings missing.  Yesterday was a good day. Today is a little harder. I dont know why? Maybe its because I am seeing my doctor in about an hour? Everything feels so real, so final.  Sometimes when I think of what happened it feels like it was a dream or like it happened to someone else.  Today it feels real and I can't seem to get a way from it.  I can't wait to feel like me again!

      I am feeling a lot better today.  My cramps have finally lightened up and I feel pretty good. I even can think about the babys face and what happened with out crying.  I feel like I can think about it and say" I got to see you once" and goodbye some how?  This morning I am getting most of the baby stuff ready to donate to a local shelter.  I am keeping a newborn hat and the ultrasound pictures in our baby keepsake box with the stuff I have saved from the girls. I just cant seem to part with it.   Thank You  for all the very sweet comments and emails!!!  Everyone of you touched my heart. How lucky I am to have met such a great circle of women over the internet.  I would be lost with out you now.  Thanks!

      I feel so lost right now. I spent most of the day yesterday on the couch while my husband and daughter worked on the house. Every now and then my husband would stop and give me a kiss, I swear I didnt even feel anything, like its not even me. We are supose to being ready for showing the house tomorrow. Were not even close to where we wanted to be on the repairs. I cant believe the bad timing for all of this, ofcorse I know there really is no  good time  for something like this bad to happen.  I just dont want to lose the new house in the process. Everyday I miss of work we lose more money, my shitty job doesnt even have sick days. I guess what is ment to be will be,  if for some reason we dont get this house, we'll find another. I just can't wait to feel like me again, when the baby isnt the first thing I think about when I wake up and every few minutes in between.  I have so much to be thankful for!  My two daughters are wonderful and healthy!  My heart really goes out to the couples who go through this with out ever having children at all!!!!!  I truely feel for them!!!

      Maybe it's wrong for me to blog all of this ?  I dont know? Is there any right or wrong here? I just feel wrong right now no matter what I am doing.   The past three days have been the worst of my life. I am not a very good writer, but that is why I started this blog. Maybe writing will help?  Wednesday around 11:30am I left work to be checked out at the hospital because I was spotting. After an exam and not finding a heart beat, I insisted on an ultasound. Of corse my instinct was right, the baby didnt make it.  Even though I some how already knew, seeing the screen for myself  (because the ultasound tech isnt aloud to say anything) was to that pointe the worst feeling I have ever felt.  I had no idea the next trip to the hospital wuld be so much worse! My wonderful doctor got to the hospital about an hour after that and explained to me that they couldnt just remove the baby there.  I was to go home and call another hospital in the morning and set the appointment to have it removed and it could take up to a week. At the time the thought of that was devastating. My husband and I went home, made a few phone calls to our parents to let know what was going on, and tried to rest. Although the thought of going to work and going on with everyday life with this baby inside me that was no longer a live, really didnt give me any chance of falling asleep. Around 11:30pm my water broke and I began to bleed.  I called my mother inlaw and asked her to come over and stay with our four year old so we didnt have to wake her and freak her out. By the time she got here I was in very painful labor.  My husband took me to the ER.  I think I was there 20 minutes when I said I have to use the bathroom,  and they let me?  I passed what I thought was more blood clots, but when I stood up I felt it was attached, when I looked down I saw the little face and hands of our baby.  Lucky my husband heard me screaming from the other room and got a nurse.  I was in shock and dont remember some of what happened next. After that they helped me in a room and cleaned me up .  The next six hours I was still in painful labor before the doctor sent me to the OB floor for help. When I did get there they knew nothing and though the baby was still inside of me,  it was by far the worst hospital experience.  I have never felt so helpless! So, the OB floor sent me back to the ER for another couple of hours,  when finaly an OB surgon came to talk to us and treat me.  By the time my surgery was finished and I recovered it was after 5:00pm. Seventeen hours we were there!  Strange how much a mother can love an unborn baby so much in just four and half months,  I will NEVER forget the very fast moment I saw that little face.  I just wish I could have done something to save it.

      I am at the office a half an hour early today,  my cold is so bad I couldnt sleep so I thought I might as well get up and get moving early.  Which gives me some extra computer time before I am on the clock. Wow, I am really addicted! If I get my sick ass up and drive to work just to be on the net when my head feels like its going to explode!  Well we placed a bid on the house we both like. Our realtor feels it is a very good offer, we bid pretty much what she is asking for the house so maybe she will be nice and give us a little extra time to sell ours?  We hope! Speaking of ours, I have to feel better by tomorrow we have so much work to do over the weekend.  I cant be sick! I cant wait for this to all be over, I am such a baby.

      We are all starting to show the stress of staying with my mom.  My daughter is crying and clinging to me like crazy. She held on to my leg two mornings in a row at her school. Which is so not like her! It's so hard, she's so little and confused. My husband and I are starting to take the stress out on each other, which I really dont want to do. It really sucks that as soon as he started working on our house his work picked up like mad, the poor man has been working 12 to 14 hour days than coming home and working on putting our house back together. We will all be sooo glad when this is over!

      Once in a while Allison my four year old will ask if we can name the new baby after Elmo or something like that, but Saturday I believe she picked the name we will use if it's a girl. While we were out shopping, out of no where she told me "I know what I want to name my new baby sister!" I said you dont know if it's a girl or a boy, and she came back with " how about Bailey, thats great"    I believe we have a winner! If it's girl that is.

She was I think a Dockson? You know, a  hot dog  dog? She was only eight weeks old, and sooo tiny and sweet ! After both of my girls holding her, the woman said she was looking for her to go to a good home, and for FREE. Of corse both girls did lots of begging. We (I ) have been wanting a dog for years. I did the right thing and took down the womans phone number so I could talk to my husband first, with no help from my teenage daughter who pleaded with me just to take her now. And of corse my hubby said no even after I did some begging myself! I know it's not the best time with us getting ready to move and all, but damn was she cute and sooo sweet. I just cant stop thinking about her.   This isnt over yet.

      I used to have an online store with hundreds of books, candles, insence, oils, herbs, music and other witchy stuff. It did okay for a year before I went back to work and  let it go. Lately I have been getting the itch to start it again.  I was wondering, how many of you purchase things like this over the internet or know someone who does?  Thanks!

         Rise o' demons and spirits great,   it 'tis the night, you can't be late   To moan and groan, to spook and scare   Lots of humans everywhere.    All the world is our playground   and scribes of magick to be found,   Of goblins, ghouls and ghastly things,   Of witches, folk and faerie rings   The night when energies abound.    The night when all toll bells doth peal,   Spooks of all ages cavort with zeal.   Shadows of the world unite;   For all the world is ours tonight!  by: Aunt Tigger and found  urlLink here.

      I am sitting here at my desk in front of my bedroom window, my favorite place. It's just a beautiful morning here in Michigan it's not too cold, the sun is shinning and trees have all the fall colors.  I am so happy to be feeling better so I can enjoy it.  I am finally feeling like myself again.  I can't say I don't think about  urlLink  the baby   everyday still,  but it's getting better. I feel like loosing my job has been some kind of gift, not something bad. I can't imagine being at work everyday over the past month. I really needed this time off. I love my mornings with Allison and our evenings together when Gerry comes home. I know I am going back to work after the holidays,  but today life is good!

      It's a cloudy and rainy morning here in Michigan. I's been nice to sit here in front of my window and read up on all my blog list.  Yesterday, I spent the afternoon playing games and eatting pizza with my daughter at Major Magics.  We had a blast, by the time we left she had over 500 tickets to spend at the gift counter (which she spent on a bunch of suckers)and I was the queen of the skeeball table! FUN, FUN...  I have so much to do today around here,  we have a showing of our house tomorrow afternoon.  ( crossing fingers) But after staying up way too late last night having fun with Gerry, I don't see me getting alot done just yet. It's been a long time sence we had a night like last night, drinking, sex, no sleep. I feel so old today!    but well worth it.

         You must like to spank or be spanked, because your romance is remeniscent of Secretary. A truly modern love story, it shows that you don't need to be conventional to be normal. You're probably the type that owns a whole lot more leather than what's upholstering your car or sofa.

      Wow! Was that a great season final or what? Last nights ending of the first season of  urlLink Nip/Tuck  was just awesome! I think the best one hour of T.V. I have seen in a very long time! I only wish we didn't have to wait so long to see another new episode.      Thinking of getting a Nip or a Tuck? Check out  urlLink their website  for a free consultation.

      My daughter and I watched  urlLink Wrong Turn  the other night. It was a good movie, but it was a bit too scary for me. If your looking for a scary movie to rent for Halloween,  I would recemend this one.   Last night my husband watched  urlLink The Matrix Reloaded.  I really liked the first one, but couldnt get into this one. Maybe I'll see it again some time it could have been my mood.

      Okay I am not going anywhere,  an addiction is an addiction no matter how hormonal or phycho you are. For me my addiction is this damn computer! I just can't believe how moody and over emotional I am!  I don't remember feeling like this when Allison or Bethany were born? I am sure it's the way things happened, I am still so sad, but I am getting better. I can honestly say I am not thinking about the baby as often as I was,  I feel like taking all of his things to the Crisis Center helped me  put some kind of closier on things.  I like knowing that he made a difference to someone other than us.  Thanks for the nice comments on my entry yesterday, you guys are the best, I can't stay away!  Oh, and a big Happy Birthday to  urlLink Cookie !!! Sounds like you had a great day!!!

      So far my weekend has been pretty good. We met my Dad for a quick dinner on Friday night,  and had dinner with my Mom and step dad last night.  I love spending time with my parents, their the best! I have been staying up late everynigt to watch the Nip/Tuck marathon but fell asleep and missed an episode.  Last nights first hour was a little too trashy for me,  so I tuned out for a while, but the next episode was great!  I love that show.  My husband came home yesterday with cards and candy for Allison and me, his sweetharts for Sweetestday! Sweetestday! I forgot!  I have never done that before. I guess with everything on my mind over the past few weeks it just got past me. I do have the sweetest husband! I am a lucky girl,  he has been so suportive through all this,  it really has brought us even closer.

      I can't believe it's been a whole week sence I was let go. I don't feel like I've been home a whole week, I still feel like I need a vacation. I know I should be upset about being with out a job,  seeing we are trying to buy a new house and pay off debt. But I am not, I am such a lazy bum. I am sure in a couple of weeks if I am still out of work I'll be stressing about it,  but for now I am just going with the flow spending some extra time with my girls and Gerry. I have also been enjoying some late night T.V. sence I don't have to be up as early. I am so hooked on Nip / Tuck, it's everything I hate about T.V. theese days,  but yet I can't stop watching it.  This week is the marathon, two episodes every night at 10 until the season final on Tuesday. I have to cover my eyes for some of the surgery shots but the show is very addicting. I just wish my husband didnt have to wake up so early so he could watch it with me, I find myself talking to the empty room  "did you see that", "no fricken way" and "oh my god".  Anyway,  T.G.I.F. (still applies if your unemployed  right ?) I hope everyone has a great weekend!

      After having problems with MSN for a while we updated our Netscape account. I can't say I like Netscape but I do like their radio that comes along with it. I have never listened to music on my computer,  I have a small CD player that sits on my desk so I always pop in what I want to hear.  I know I am a little behind the times as usual. But they have a station that all Madonna!  Not just the same silly songs you hear on the radio,   all Madonna music and uncencered. So I am spending this beautiful fall afternoon at my desk in my bathrobe surfing my favorite sites and grooving in my seat to only Madonna. A much needed self indulgence couple of hours.

      I have preached to everyone in the past that I HATE trash T.V. Meaning most of the new so called reality shows and shows with a lot of skin and flash to them. Well I have to confess a little something here. Because I have been a long time fan of  urlLink Julian McMahon  I had to check out  urlLink Nip/Tuck  even though the previews look like everything I hate about T.V.  The first time I tuned in I didn't last long,yep too trashy for me. I tuned in again a week later and now I am  so  hooked! I am so happy to see Julian still on T.V. He is just so great being the guy you love to hate!! After all he was the Source Of All Evil!!     Grab the popcorn, tonights the marathon starting from the begining.

      I finaly took all the baby's stuff to the crisis center yesterday. I knew if I didn't I was never going to feel better. I have to say it was much harder to leave then I expected. I knew I would feel sad, but I cried so hard.  One of the very nice women who work there sat and talked to me for a few minutes. It is so sad to hear about some of the poor women they deal with, babies sleeping in drawers, only having one bottle.  I know I did the righ thing. My baby made a difference to some one. I decided to donate everything I had bought for this baby.  It means more to me to help someone than worry about returning things for the money.   I can't wait to feel like me again, when I am not thinking about all this so often. I know I will never forget that little face or feelling the baby move  but I know soon I will be able to make it through a day with out feelling sad.  I'm here without you baby,  but your still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time. I'm here without you baby, but your still with me in my dreams. ~3doorsdown

      Well as if what I have lost over the past two weeks isn't enough, yesterday I lost my job. What I was told was " they are making changes and will no longer need me". Even though I have  never  been let go or fired before  I am thinking thats not  really  the case. I know that it just wasn't the job for me, I was bord most of the time, I didnt fit in at all, and I know they felt the same way. Some times no matter what it's just not right.  Looking on the bright side,  I could use a little time off with my family to heal from loosing the baby. I just hope I find something I like soon.  Today is Bethany's first dance!  Homecoming.  I am so excited. My mom is coming over to take  a ton  of pictures. I am spending the day playing with Allison and making a nice dinner, not thinking of any problems and being very thankful for my two beautiful girls  and wonderful family.

      After much shopping and no luck we had a dress made for my daughter to wear to her first Homecoming dance. The woman who made it did a wonderful job! I'll be taking lots of pictures of her and her best friend before they leave for the dance on Saturday,  so you can look for them by Sunday.  I am so proud, she is so beautiful!  Picking up the dress was a nice way to end a really hard day. I felt pretty good to begin with, my day was moving by kind of fast. But a coworker who just had a baby about 5 weeks ago decided she would bring the baby to work with her this afternoon. I cant believe how bad that made me feel.  Listening to everyone fuss over the baby. I couldnt help but hide in the bathroom and cry. I guess its only been two weeks tomorrow, over all I am doing pretty good. I am sure it will get easier with time,  at least thats what everyone tells me.

      Today has been a little harder than the past few. I can't seem to think of much else. I saw on the news last night a couple of stories of child abuse, one leading to the baby's death. The baby crawled into a bucket of cleaner and died. What the hell is the matter with people? I can't help but wonder about the  big picture .  I don't get it,  how some people can have these uncared for babies and mine  who would have been so wanted and very loved and didnt make it? I am sure all this will get easier as time goes on,  but it sure does suck right now! I just want to kick and scream on the floor like a crazy person,  "I want him back".  I will most likely sit here at my desk for three more hours pretending to work, go home to my beautiful daughter and wonderful husband who will make me smile all evening and then cry myself to sleep.  I hope tomorrow is a better day!

      Lets just celebrate James Spader coming to T.V. a little bit more. My list of  urlLink Spader movies;   6. The ultimate 80's movie we all loved to hate him in  "Pretty In Pink".  5. Lets not forget the sexy bad boy he was in  "Bad Influence".  4. Can't forget him in  "Sex lies and Vidotape "? What a great movie! 3.  And whos heart did not go out to him in  "White Palace"  ? What he would give up for a woman, wow! 2. I know it didnt do well at the movies,  you may have not even heard of this one but it's on the new releases shelf now.  "The Stick up"  and I really liked it. One of my favorites. 1. Of corse who could ever forget him or some of things he does in   "The Secretary "? This one is not for the prude, WOW!

        Welcome!     The past two weeks I have tuned in and fallen in love again with The Practice. Thanks to one of my favorite actors,  urlLink James Spader . I did like the show the first few seasons, but getting rid of all the ego filled cast and adding James was such a great move! I think I finally found a show I might enjoy spending an hour with every week?

      For some reason I can't get online at home. My MSN isint working, or my Internet Explorer. After freaking out and talking on the phone to MSN and then to WOW about the cable modem. They all say everything is fine on their end.  GREAT, its not fine on my end! I can't live another day with out  the internet. After sitting here over the last hour trying again on the phone, I remembered that when they installed the cable modem they installed Netscape. Well looky looky I am online. Only one major problem, most of the pages I want to read are all scrambled! I can get MSN homepage, Netscape homepage and other comerical sites. But my blog and everyone elses are are unreadable! Does anyone know of such a thing? I have never used the Netscape before, is there a setting I need to fix? I dont get it! I think someone is really trying to test me here!!!! If you have any ideas PLEASE email me!!!!

      Yesterdays appointment with the doctor went good I guess,  no infections and everything seems to be healing.  Today I am back in the office trying to keep busy.  I am thinking this is better than being home alone all day. I cant believe its been one week today! I already miss that feeling of being pregnant.  Thank you again for all the nice and support filled emails and comments!

      Before he went to work this morning  I saw Gerry standing in the hallway outside our bedroom door.  What are you doing I asked him? he tells me, I heard something in the basement and the cat is right here. Being half asleep,  I said, maybe it was the next door neighbors gate,  and I laid back down.  No big woop. A couple of hours later when I woke up  what do you think was the first thing I thought about? He didn't even go down stairs to check! I thought I heard a noise,  where's the cat? Maybe it was her?  I was scared to death! Should I go look? Hell no! That's what all the stupid women do in the movies  before someone jumps out and butchers them. Silly! That's what I told myself,  I have too much to do I can't hide in the bed all day  and wait for Gerry to get off work so he can  come home to look in the basement. I got up  #1 because I had to pee like never before. #2 I had to shower and leave to pick up Allison by 10:30. I'll just hurry to get ready and get out of here.  I went to take my shower, and Damn!!! All the towels were down stairs. I had to go into the basement. Too bad Max is just a puppy,  if anyone was hiding down there he wouldn't care, unless they had a puppy treat. Then he would sit and give them kisses. I went (ran) down there being the adult I am, took my shower and went on with my day.   I am such a dork! I feel so silly! Does this ever happen to anyone else or should I stop watching scary movies?

      It's cold, dark and raining today. My house is still messy from yesterday. I think I'll turn on the T.V.  eat some Christmas cookies and fall asleep on the couch for a while.

      Well, I didn't leave the house until 6:30am this morning. I headed up to Toy R US first in hopes that the  urlLink desk we have picked out for Allison would be on sale. No such luck,  and the store was just nuts, so many people you couldn't even shop. I don't understand why, they really didn't have very many good prices this year. I remember when the day after Thanksgiving was the best day to save money on toys and gifts. This year I was very disappointed in the sales. So after walking what felt like forever in the pouring cold rain through the parking lot, I left Toysrus empty handed. I then went to Target and picked up a couple of things, I found  urlLink the baby doll  Allison wants,  of course it wasn't even on sale,  but I did get a good deal on the Lion Kig DVD for $11.00  and The HUlk Hands for $12.00 and few stocking stuffers. Both places were sold out of the Leappad books I was hoping to get for only$ 9.99. I guess that's what I get for over sleeping in till 6:30.

      My holiday went well, it was full of family, friends and lots of yummy food. Now I have to make my turkey stuffed self go to sleep soon, so I can be up and at Toy's R Us at 6:00am for the big sales! Yes, I am one of those women,  I love to shop the morning after Thanksgiving with all the crazy people.  The real crazy mom's who will kick, scream and fight over the last Barney DVD because they have to have it 50% off  or they are just going to die, or kill some one trying,  yeah... That could be me.

      I can't believe it's almost afternoon already! I have been on this computer for far too long this morning,  pretending that I have nothing to do,  when I have loads of house work, running around and prep to do for tomorrow. I did start a private journal page this morning. I thought I would try writing a little more personal thoughts, a place where I can feel a little more open.  If you are interested  urlLink email me  for the password.  I hope everyone has a Wonderful Turkey Day Tomorrow!

      It has been a very cold and busy couple of days here. The weather went from sunny and warm to total freezing in 24 hours. The part that really sucks is that Max is still too small to just run out the door into the yard to go potty,  I have to take him out on a leash.  He needs just about two more inches  and he'll be safe in our yard.  I am so looking forward to that!  Sunday I had a very good friend over for dinner,  we haven't seen each other for a while and I am really missing her. Of coarse my house was like a fricken zoo,  I was so embarrassed! It was a bad day from the moment I woke up.  By the afternoon I was doing laundry just for a reason  to hide in the basement for a few minutes, not that it was really working  every time I was down there all I heard up here was  "mom, mom, mom  MOOOM  where are you?" Just an example of what the evening was like when my girlfriend was here, Allison came in to the kitchen holding her hand tight,  and said it hurt. I asked her if the puppy bit her, sense she was bothering him all bloody day? She told me no, she burned it. On what I asked?  The toilet paper she told me. Oh okay, that makes a lot of sense, I told her oh your fine, that's silly. After I said that she started to cry, "I am sorry mommy,  I am sorry". So I looked in to the bathroom and the roll of toilet paper is flaming on the back of the toilet. She said it fell in to the candle that is sitting on the other side of the room. I still can't believe she did that! I have been lighting candles sense she was born,  at least she was scared enough to come and tell me. And that's just one example of the rest of the evening, there was lots of yelling,teenage drama, and puppy piles being walked through. I don't think my girlfriend will be over again soon, unless the kids are gone or asleep for the night. My life is usually so boring...

      Gerry and I had a nice night last night. Seeing we were alone in the house,  I made us a candle light dinner, fresh fish for him, stuffed shrimp for me,  some red skin potatoes backed in butter and garlic,  and mixture of fresh veggies. It was nice, and the private dessert afterwards was great! It feels so good to be happy again. I still think about  urlLink what happened , but I really am learning to deal with it.  Tonight I am making a Mexican feast for everyone. Is that the blender I hear? Can we say Margaritas?

      I can't believe it's that time of year already! Are we sure that Thursday is Thanksgiving? Really sure? I know the holidays are the same dates every year,  so why am I never ready?  I guess it's time to break out all the holiday stuff next week. The tree and decorations, and Christmas movies. I love kids Christmas movies, Disney movies and Frosty. My favorite is  urlLink Christmas Vacation.  I laugh so hard every time I see that movie. What I can't stand is black & white movies, just because their old doesn't make them good, to me! I'll take Chevy Chase over James Stewart any day!  Whats your favorite Christmas movie?

      I went  urlLink here  to see why I can't seem to stop eating lately. No such luck, I can't blame the stars, damn! I don't understand why I am doing this to myself? I was doing so good , I even lost a little weight, was feeling good. I bet I have gained that back and then some over the past couple of weeks. It's like I just can't get full? I can't stop myself. Even as I type this  I am sucking down a bag of trail mix and a Dt.CherryCoke. grrr....Maybe it's the weather turning cold? I have to get a grip on this before I am really unhappy. I belong to a spa I never go to, maybe it's time to jump back on the machines? I just know I will end up working out a bit,  and enjoying the pool and sauna the rest of the afternoon.  But you know what, maybe that okay?

      Sometimes I can't believe the stuff people look up on the internet! Worse, that they some how find me! I check my sitemeter often and where the hits come from. It's funny how search engines come up with my site. I see first gyno pictures almost daily, and ofcorse a lot of wiccan topics. Some are really funny, like coyote catching the roadrunner.  Today I saw someone found me looking for Flitstones having sex pictures? What the hell?  I wont type the really gross stuff,  but believe me there are a lot of sick people in this world!

      I have this idea. I used to make homemade candy, chocolates mostly every thing from cream fillings, cherries, peanutbutter creams. nuts and coverd pretzels, and some very detailed painting for special events and holidays. I know a lot of other people used to do this,  but I was very good and made a lot of extra money doing  it for showers and weddings and such. I am not a crafty person,  but this is one thing I have been good at in the past. So my idea is to see if I am still good at this ? I have so many new ideas, products, and a website. My only problem is that I am having trouble with a name. The .com of the name I really like is taken by a shitty domain company that wants over $600.00 for the name! ASSHOLES! and the .net is taken but thank goodness has nothing to do with candy or gifts. So I am thinking of the .org? Do people really remeber them as much as the .com's?  Should I keep trying to think of another name?  I don't know. What do you think?

      Last night being with out any kids Gerry and I went out for dinner and a drink to  urlLink Outback . The food was great,  I just finished my yummy Shrimp and Chicken Fettuccini for lunch.  Today we are going to my parents for Italian Meatballs made by Allisons and her Papa. My stepdad has been waiting for Alli to be old enough to teach this tradition to that he learned from his grandfather. I am sure dinner will be great and Allison will be so proud of herself.

      I have a cold, soar throat and a kidney infection. I havent slept in two days. My doctor is sending me for some tests on Tuesday to make sure there is nothing wrong with my kidneys, I guess the infection is pretty strong.  All I know is I have been feeling like crap for almost a week now,  I need some relief, other then my double milk chocolate hot cocoa,  and the slow working pills the doctor already gave me.  I can't breathe, swallow and it feels like someone has kicked me in my lower back. And just to bitch a little more, my computer is acting funny, moving real slow!!! HELP!  Just sharing my Thursday morning, hows yours?

      Puppy update. So far Max only had the one bad night, the rest have been good nights full of puppy dreams and sleep for us. He is just so smart! Already sitting when I get out a cookie, barking when he needs to go out. The little guy has had very few puddles and piles in the house. He listens when I say NO and some times when I say DOWN, is coming when we call him. He is even getting along with Baby our pissy fat cat. They keep wanting to eat from the same dish. Max really is the best pup for us and is working out just great!  More pictures coming soon! I am working on a photo page.

      Yesterday my husband and I welcomed a new member to our little coven.     A woman I met on the internet runs a Great Dane rescue  and she stumbled accross three little Cocker Mix pups that got left behind,  two boys and one girl, all three solid black.  Growing up with a very simular mixed Cocker, I fell in love at first sight. She being the caring person she is took care of them including all their shots,  first two vet appointments, worming, hartworm,and mico chipped them,  before giving them to a good home. Well, yesterday we went and picked up ours!  He is so sweet! I couldnt wait! I have been planning and waiting for a good time to buy a dog  for over six years. I have been back and forth over which breed to purchase.  I didnt want just any dog.  As soon as I saw that face,  I forgot about the expensive breeds I have been researching and had to have him.  So far Max has been a wonderful addition to our family! A very smart, loving and easy going puppy!

      My Holiday was nice,  it was filled with family,  laughs and lots of good food! My girls had a very Merry Christmas. Allison got into bed with us around 5:00am and slept until 7:30am  it was so nice, she is still so tiny and sweet! My parents come over for breakfast every year  and to see the girls open their gifts.  This year I made Breakfast Pizza's,  they were so good, and easy! I'll have to post the recipe later today.  Today is all about finding places in my little house  for all the new things that need to be put away. This takes all day.  A day of sorting, making room, throwing out, and cleaning out.  That's why Allison went home with her Grandma last night. At least I have some new music to play afternoon while I do all this. Bethany bought me the new Seal and Dido CD's for Christmas. I new I would love them both, their great! Bethany received a Crystal Wisdom Kit from my mother inlaw, so we are planning a Mother Daughter night Monday to watch movies and check it out. The big hits for Allison were Hulk Hands, the desk and Barbie Laptop.  Nowl, I am off to check out how some of my  favorite bloggers spent their holiday before  I head back into my living room and back to work.    urlLink      urlLink    Allison's new desk, computer, and fax machine.

       urlLink Golden Globe Nominees  were released today. Yahoo for my first choice  urlLink Nip / Tuck   for a Best Drama nod! I am very disappointed that  urlLink Julian  was not nominated! I do love Award Shows! I love watching them with Bethany, we stay up and eat popcorn. Goo over the dresses we love, make fun of the ones we don't. Clap for the winners we love, and yell at the T.V. at the ones we don't. isn't that what it's all about? What fun...

      While out yesterday my Mom and I saw  urlLink Something Gotta Give.  It was very cute, and worth seeing. What really bothers me  ( what now, your asking yourself)  Why do I have to sit through T.V. commercials at the theater? Don't we see enough of that shit at home? I mean when did they start that? I have been to the movies two times over the last six months. Both were just this month. Both times I saw commercials for Levis, Ciggular,Coke Cola,  and T.V. shows. I love the previews,  I am one of the people who must get there early  just so I don't chance missing any of them. This really pisses me off!

      I have been out the past three days in a row shopping. Today I plan on driving Allison to her grandma's house,  visiting my beautiful grandma who is in a nursing home,  and wrapping all the gifts that are  piled on top of my dresser  and at the foot of my bed.  Than maybe my husband and I can actually  get out of bed with tripping over some thing?

      I seem to be thinking a lot more about  urlLink the baby  and what happened over the past two days. Everyone knows the holidays makes us more emotional,  I guess. I often think about him when I am in the shower. I think about how big my belly would be right now if he would have lived. I don't always blame myself,  but sometimes I wonder if it was anything I did,  was I letting the stress of the house being worked on get to me too much?  Could I have been healthier? Why couldn't my body save him? I think of the little face I saw and the ten little fingers that were so tiny. I wish I could see him again, touch him and tell him I am his Mommy. That's the kind of things I have been thinking about. Is this normal? Who the hell knows! I don't feel depressed, just sad. I am not letting these feeling cloud over my life  or my time with my daughters. But they are very real and I can't pretend that they aren't there. Getting Max has helped a lot,  but I don't think anything will ever make me forget. I don't think about these things everyday,  but lately there just seems to be so many reminders.

      I have been sitting here for too long just blog reading, not wanting to do anything. My house is so quiet. My poor over worked husband is working. Allison is at my Moms, Bethany is at her Dads,  the pup and fat cat are both napping already. I think I'll hit the couch with a pillow and listen to some music for while. I should get dressed and do some Christmas shopping? Naaa, a nap and my left over salad from the restaurant last night  sound much better at this moment. I can be so lazy at times.

      The showing on our house was canceled. So if anyone out there is looking for a good Christmas gift,  I know where you can get one.  Bethany's job interview went well,  they had two more girls to talk to and told her to look for their call on Monday. Working at the movies would be such a fun after school job. I hope she gets it.  I on the other hand just got out of my second shower for the day, thanks to Max peeing on my coat. I had the damn thing dry cleaned and it still smells like piss. What the people at Farmer Jacks must of thought of me? I am trying Frabreeze now, I am on my second spraying. If anyone out there knows how to get out  the smell of puppy pee, I am all ears?

      Gerry and I final went out Saturday night,  it was so nice to get away for an evening. We saw  urlLink Mystic River  and went to TGI Friday's for dinner and a drink. We were not impressed by Friday's at all,  but I really liked the movie. It is a slow moving but very well made film. I would recommend it.  Before going to the show we went to a local computer store and bought my Mom a used computer for Christmas.   Because of the 30 day warranty we are giving it to her tonight at dinner. I am so excited to get her all hooked up and running.  We also put up our tree and decorations with the girls last night. Allison being only four was a lot of fun,  every time I would unwrap an ornament she liked  she was so excited to put it on the tree,  Bethany on the other hand being sixteen,  I had to force her off the computer and  yell at her to pretend to be happy to hang them up with her little sister.  The life of a teenage girl is so filled with drama all the time. I don't know how my parents lived through it? But I sure am grateful for them now.

      I took Max to the vet this morning,  Allison is home today from school after a full night of coughing and went with me.  Let me tell you how much fun it was...  I bet the people all the way down the hall  and into the lobby could hear me echoing from that little room: "Allison stop that, stop that I said, please sit down,  Max sit, Max NO, Allison don't touch that, Allison & Max just sit" Than the vet tells me she thinks he is going to be about 20 pounds larger then what I expected! Besides still having two kinds of worms in his stool, his check up went well. A whole $130.00 well,  when I was expecting under $80.00. grrr... Does anything ever go as planned?

      For some reason our computer can no longer read the hard drive! What a nightmare.  So my husband put back the old hard drive that was once in here. Shhhew...So glad we have it!  At least we can still get online. This hard drive is pretty messed up, but at least I am here! I can't use any kind of search, not google or any other search engine,  I can only go through links and what I have saved on my favorites. It is funny to see the old things I had saved in the Documents and on the Favorites. I am thinking Gerry will be working on this for the next couple of evenings.  The computer was running so good too! Fast! So if I am gone for a couple of days,  that's why.

      The sun is really shining in my bedroom window this morning. Too bad I know how flippin cold it is out there, or I might say its a pretty day. That sun cant fool me, I know as soon as I walk out the door I am going to let out  a couple of swear words and wish I was in another state where it not only looks sunny and nice, it really is.  We had the nicest evening last night. We drove past the new house and saw a big red SOLD sign on it. YEAH!  I am really getting excited now. I'll have to go back this afternoon and snap a picture of it.  Dinner was great with my parents, as always. I love spending time with them.  I am so lucky to have such wonderful and happy parents. So now I am taking my lucky ass out in to the cold weather to pick up Allison and do a little grocery shopping. OOOO lucky me.

Then I am picking up siding for my husband to do patch work on the side of our house this weekend. And this evening I am having dinner with my parents, something I am so looking forward to. I really have been feeling down and missing my Dad lately.  We live only ten minutes apart, I don't know why we don't spend more time together.   OH, and as of last evening no more stress over either house issue. All the papers are signed and its a locked deal. I am so excited now. We should be closing with in a couple of weeks. Soon after that we will be  movin' on up like George and Wissey.

      Well the last of our inspections are complete! This morning was the one we were most stressed over.  From the mortgage company who is buying our house.  If they don't think the house is worth what we are selling it for,  well then there's no deal and if there's no deal here than there's no deal on the new house. To make matters even more stressful, it seems there is someone new who wants to place a bid on the house we are buying.  All this confuses me, confuses me so much I don't even know how to write it all out. All I do know is that we have signed an agreement, paid an inspector, put down $1000.00, and paid $300.00 to a mortgage company that we signed with all on this new house, you would think damn it that would make it ours !  I guess their is a clause that our house has to be with out a doubt sold, and that leads us to today's inspector. He was happy with the house and was only here for a matter of three minutes, said everything looks good inside but he might have a couple of things to write up on the out side and that he will have it all written up this afternoon. If he writes an okay, then the realtors have it all locked up and no one new can bid on either house, it's a done deal.  I know if I just sit here and wait to hear something I will go mad,  so I am taking my Mom to get our hair cut after lunch.  Hopefully when I get home I'll hear that everyone is happy and that everything is just hunky dory...Please.

      Could it stop snowing already? I really don't want anymore! Snow is nice on Christmas day, it's nice to look out the window and see the pretty white stuff, but if you have to drive in it daily, and it's covering up some nasty ice, it's not so freakin pretty.  I was up with the roosters this morning. The woman that is buying our house, asked if she could bring her parents by to see the inside. They'll be here any time between 8:30 & 10:00am. So I was up an hour early to make sure the place looks nice for her. Yeah, I am nice like that.  Things are moving so fast! Her mortgage inspector will be here tomorrow morning to appraise the house, after he is happy we set a date to close.  I am starting to get excited about being in the new house, having the space to put things away and setting up the computer room, how cool is that  "a computer room"! I am so excited.

      My living room was the place to be last night for the Golden Globes! It was filled with shrimp cocktails, drinks, chips, popcorn and raisinets. And a few very silly and very loud women in P.J's.  We had a blast! 2003 was a great year for movies.  We were very happy with most of the award winners. Of course not all, but most. I can say even though I wanted to when 24 won over Nip / Tuck, there wasn't any throwing of the popcorn this time. Although I do believe my daughter tossed a few raisinets at the T.V. when Bill Murry took the award over our man  urlLink Johnny Depp.   Yay for  urlLink Sean Penn , a much deserved Best Actor award!  I would love to see him get the Oscar this year. Another big yay for the very talented  urlLink RenneeZellwger  who stole every seen she was in during Cold Mountain.  Looking very classy and just so damn cute, she was our favorite of the night! Our favorite guy? Hands down, we all agreed  urlLink Jude Law , even if he didn't go home with an award last night, he was a big winner here.  Okay, my rundown of the show: J-Lo - could you look more sad? We already know you lost your man, we read the Star. Sharon Stone - Can we say mental, she looked as if she broke out of a hospital, that must have been where she left her bra. Charlize Theron - Was she drunk or stoned? She couldn't even hold herself up on the red carpet. Scarlett Johnsson - Are you a bitch to work with or what? Three awards went to the movie you stared in and not one person said thank you. hummm.... Peter Jackson - I know this is an easy one, but your not a character from your movie, your a director, just comb your hair a bit or maybe even shave?

      The local weather is saying we are going to get lots more snow by tomorrow. I really don't want it! I think after picking up my rental car, I will head to the store and stock up on some goodies for the weekend. I have to go shopping for my Golden Globes get together anyway.  Every year my daughter and I take over the living room for a couple of award shows. The Globes are our favorite! We start with dinner on the couch during E!'S live at the red carpet show, that's when we fill out our ballots and place our bets. Then that is followed by lots of snacking, name calling, hooting and hallowing at the T.V. until the awards are all passed out. This does sometimes include some throwing of the popcorn.  This year we are happy to be including Bethany's best friend and my  urlLink sister  in our silly little night.  We do get pretty silly. I really look forward to spending this time with Bethany, we have a lot of fun! I am going to hate the day when she is all grown up and so busy that she doesn't want to hang out with her old Mom even to watch an award show.

      The woman who is buying our house was here this morning with her inspector. I believe everything went well, everyone looked and sounded happy when they left. I sure hope there are no surprises later. Her mortgage company has to do another inspection in about two weeks, then we can close. While chatting about vacations and such, we discovered that our parents are good friends. How funny is that? What a small world.  I am so glad that we are dealing with friendly people both selling and buying. I have heard some pretty scary stories from other people.  It is so cold out today, I would love to stay inside and play video games with Allison all afternoon! But I have to go pick up a rental car now that mine is in the bodyshop for a while. Thanks to some asshole who slammed into it while I was fast asleep. I would feel so bad if I hit a parked car, of course the ass didn't even leave me a note.

      Okay so yesterday when I said  urlLink this,  I never made it to the basement.  The silence was just too nice, and besides that it was too fricken cold down there.  Well, today I have to face it, like it or not. I have all the heat vents open and the heat cranked way up.  We have our first inspection tomorrow morning and there are a few things that just have to be done today.  Another fun task I have to face is Allison's closet!  It has to be cleaned out for easy access to the attic for the inspector.  This is going to be no easy task!  ((HERE)) is where I was trying to insert a picture of the messy closet,  but the batteries just went dead in my camera,  damn!  I think I'll do some blog reading for a bout 20 minutes while the basement warms up, and then I better just get it done. I am so lazy!

We found out that our first inspection is this Friday morning already. Things are moving pretty fast.  I would love to sit here and work on my  urlLink Nip Tuck site  for a while,  and forget all my selling, moving worries, but I have too much that needs to be done around the house. I do have the main layout finished and most of the index page set. I still have to come up with a good header for the top of the page,  I just stink at graphics.   Happy Hump Day !

      I have been so busy the past few days, and it's not going to end any time soon. The next seven days are going to be filled with meetings, paper work, details, house cleaning, inspections,and more paper work. We have agreed to do both closings back to back. Which is good because things are going to move pretty fast. I just can't believe if all goes well that we will actually be in our new house in just a matter of a month. We have been talking and planning on this over two years.  I am doing my usual, over thinking and worrying about all the little things and details.  Driving my husband crazy already! I will be one happy chick when all of this stuff is done and we close on both houses.

      My Horoscope:  You may still be trying to settle your energies back down after a recent upset of some sort. The fully calming day you are seeking will have to wait, for even if you get to take some down time now, you still could be a bit agitated. Talking about it may help, but it would be better if you could work off some of your anxiety through physical activity. Then again, getting started could be tough. You are tempted to think about doing something instead of actually doing it--but it's not the same thing.  This is me today!!!

      My Sunday started off so nice! My girls spent the night with my  urlLink sister,  so the house was very quiet, even the puppy slept in. We received a call from our realtor with the woman's counter offer  and we took it, so our house is  sold  as soon as we sign all the papers and she has it inspected. Then we found out that we got the house we really wanted,  whole shit, doesn't get any better than that! I am so excited! What a great morning!  Then the yang! I looked out the window and saw while I was enjoying  my long sleep, some asshole hit my SUV! Took the mirror off the drivers side and put a couple of nice looking dents above the rear tire. I wish I would have saw who did it! The deductible is $500.00! After getting over that, I went to Home depot for Gerry. Even though he gave me a little list of things he needed, it still sucked. I hate trying to shop for things I don't know anything about. So I load up all my manly things in his big manly truck and the damn thing wouldn't start! I couldn't fucking believe it!  Come the frickin on! What else?  Were we too excited about the house deal?  So after meeting up the tow truck guy,  a guy that is known by the name of Dirty Dave,  and it's not because he needs a shower.  Our F250 is now in the shop. What a day! But, I am still going to do my happy dance tomorrow evening when we sign all our papers!  I am so excited,  I think I'll do a little dancing now!

       urlLink look what I started this morning.  I just couldn't help myself, it's going to be so much fun! Some women get the hair colored or buy jewelry as a pick me up,  me I buy more net space. I think I am feeling better already?

      Bethany and I saw  urlLink Cold Mountain  last night. It was not the Hallmark kind of love story I was expecting, but it was a great movie with an amazing cast.  here's my quick rundown; Jude Law- Awesome, handsome, does a wonderful job. Nicole Kidman- Beautiful, strong and very talented. Renee Zellweger- Stole almost every scene she was in, just fantastic! Natalie Portman- Can't over look her performance, very well done. Philip Seymour Hoffman- Another scene stealer, a great part of the movie. Kathy Baker- Well done as always. James Gammen- Always a good supporting actor.  After the movie we did some late night shopping at  urlLink Meijer.  Let me tell you... You see some very strange things in a Meijer after midnight. By far my favorite night owl was the middle aged mullet guy who was playing air guitar in front of a display T.V. showing AC/DC.   We had a lot of fun!

      I know this because my  urlLink healthy lunch  went right out the window, and the chocolate covered grams down my throat. Exercise? Yeah sure,  if you call lifting a bag of trail mix above my mouth and shaking it exercise. My moods are all over the place. Somebody help me, I am nuts! My poor husband! I think good husbands are so underrated. I am not the only woman I know that has PMS like this once in a while. Would we be able to handle it,  if it were the husbands who felt and acted like this? Goddess Bless Em!

      I have the whole day to myself! Until 5:00 anyway. We have a meeting with our Realtor. Then after dinner Bethany and I are going out to a movie. My plan is to do a little shopping and get my hair cut, be here in time to eat a healthy lunch in front of the T.V. watching Judging Amy. Then maybe a little nap? Who knows. Now I am off to exercise and shower, I must get out of this funk I am in. I have been so moody and down the last few days. PMS? Maybe. Winter Blues? Maybe. I have been thinking about  urlLink the baby  a lot,  and not being able to find a job is really a  downer!  Toss in some PMS and that's where I have been all week. But I am ending it!  I am shaping up a bit, with eating better and exercise . I am going to feel better. I have too!

      I am venturing out this morning to dig out my SUV from all the snow and ice. So I can drive Allison to her Grandma's house for a two day visit. If it wasn't her Grandma's birthday tomorrow, I don't think I would be making this trip. It's a half hour or so on a good day. Who knows how long it will take today? I plan to leave nice and early, so I in no way see rush hour traffic. It's bad enough to be out in this weather.  I feel so bad for my husband and for my  urlLink sister  who have to deal with traffic in this crap daily!  This week and in this weather I really don't mind not having a job.

      Like most people I have gotten into some bad eating habits over the holidays. It's time to get back on track! Not just to loose a few pounds but to feel better. I was doing really good before Christmas and I felt so much better. So I am stocked up on Lean Cuisine lunches and other low cal food.  I am also ready to get back to exercising every morning before I shower. Of coarse Iam not starting back today, maybe tomorrow? Yeah tomorrow sounds good.  Maybe I am just PMSing?

      I am doing a bunch of nothing today. At least most of the day.  I have to fold some cloths and make a trip to my bank to roll over my 401K into an IRA before I pick up Allison, so I guess that is not really nothing, but I am taking my time doing things and not leaving the house until 3:00pm. I think I might even turn on some music and soak in the tub, in the middle of the day. Now that's something I could never do while I was working.  Tomorrow I have plans to spend the afternoon with a dozen naked ladies. ha ha... Just kidding, well kinda. I am taking my Mom and Grandma to lunch and to see  urlLink Calendar Girls.  It looks like a cute movie.       Speaking of movies, did anyone watch the  urlLink Lifetime  movie last night? Gracie's Choice. I thought it was a great movie and very well done. If you missed it, they are running it again on Sunday evening.

      I really don't have much to post here lately. My weekend was nice. On the quite side but nice. Friday night I was up till about 2:00am watching movies with Bethany  and her Best Friend. Saturday hubby and rented  urlLink S.W.A.T , it was okay.  A great cast but just not a great movie to me. Sunday I cleaned house and played card games with Allison. My  urlLink sister  and my hansom little nephew came by for a visit, who I always love spending time with.  I should hear something today from the realtor if the woman who wants our house is taking out counter offer. They did contact my realtor Saturday to say she is still very interested. So it is looking pretty good for us. Hope Hope Hope....

      We had our little meeting last evening, they presented their offer. We went into the other room with out realtor and laughed. The buyer was asking us to pay over $7000.00 for her to buy our house. Telling us that it is a gift and a tax write off. Are ya crazy?  We are not desperate to leave.  It's just our time to move in to a better house in a better neighborhood. So, our realtor wrote up a second offer for them to take to the buyer one we could live with and we should hear something either this afternoon or Monday. I hope she takes it. If not, hey there will be others, it's a nice house.  I am not worried. It would just be nice to be done with it all.

      Allison is staying with her grandparents tonight. Which means hubby and I will be alone in the house. hmmm...Wonder what we can find to do, all alone? I am sure I think up a spell or two.  I am so glad that tomorrow is Friday. Not that I have a job or anything, but I still look forward to the weekends. Normally when Allison is gone overnight I might sleep in. Not tomorrow.  Benicio Del Toro is going to be on Good Morning America, and then at 11:00am he is on The View. Sounds like a good morning to me.  I think I'll make myself some breakfast and park my butt on the couch for a couple of hours. Something I don't do very often anymore.   Still don't know who Benicio is?  I just cant believe that!  Wont except it!  If you read my blog, you must know who the man is.  So I put  urlLink this  together this morning.   urlLink

      I have decided to keep things shoved and hidden for a while. You know, enjoy the illusion of having a clean and well organized house for a couple of days. I am showing the house again this afternoon,  so it makes sense. If only I wasn't out of socks, I guess I'll have to unpack the dryer. But that's it, the rest can stay as is till the weekend. I am enjoying this.

      After driving Allison to school this morning I went for a 10 minute oil change. The oil change may only be 10 minutes but the wait was 20. Knowing that I have a list of things to clean and put away before people come to look at our house at 1:30, I just didn't have the time to just sit there. I ran in to Farmer Jacks for pop, I can't live with out Dt. Dr Pepper in the house. Which put me home around 9:00am. No biggie, that still gives me over four hours, right? Nope.  My realtor called and said we have another showing this morning at 10:30am. 10:30?  Can they at least give me until after 11:00am. How do you tell someone your house can't be shown because your on the computer all the time instead of keeping your house clean and organized? So I became a crazy woman for a couple of hours. I cleaned, wiped, scrubbed and hid everything any where I could. As long as no one looks under or in anything I am cool! I even used the dryer.  The 10:30 showing went great, they seemed to really like the house and were very friendly. I expect to hear from them, if not I will be surprised. The second couple at 1:30 were a little early. Fine, I was ready. They did not seem impressed. In fact she seemed snotty. Even though I could tell she didn't care for the house, she still looked inside everything she could. I have a bedroom closet that we keep a couple of my husbands guns in, so it is locked. Of course she wanted to see what was in there. I opened it only half way. I don't understand the attitude at all, if your so much better than this house way is it your price range?  I don't expect to hear from them. I wonder if they opened the dyer while in the basement?   Thursday afternoon I get to do this again. I just wish someone would just buy the house, it's a good house. I just want to move on. Maybe my feeling are right and we'll hear from the first couple. Who knows?

Now anyone who knows me, or has been reading here for very long knows  that anything with Benicio Del Toro is a real give in for me, a must see. But honestly, this movie was so well done. Naomi Watts and Sean Penn both were amazing.  If this movie is playing near you, it is a must to see on the big screen.

      I have been wanting a dog for over six years!  I planed on buying a  urlLink Cavalier Spaniel  but couldn't find one for under $600.00. A sweet little lap dog. When I saw Max in an email I fell in love with his Cocker face.  24 pounds full grown is what I was told, not a lap dog but still a small lovey dog.  When we brought him home he was the cutest little thing!  Our only worry was that he growled while eating his food and  if anyone walked by he would snap. Mostly at Allison. After talking to the vet I started taking his food away and giving it back after a few minutes every time I fed him. This seemed to work. For a while anyway.  Like most puppies he also liked to chew on our hands and feet,  so I bought him tons of chew toys and have used some strong discipline. He turned out to have more Lab in him then Cocker and he is now about forty pounds. He is a good dog, except we cant seem to get him to stop the snapping. This really has me worried at his size.  He bites Allison often,  since loosing his baby teeth he leaves actual puncture holes at times.  I am freaked out that he might one day really hurt her.  I cant leave them alone for very long with out worrying.  To some there may be an easy answer to this,  find the dog a new home with out small children.  At times I think that is the only answer.  If he ever did really hurt Allison,  my husband would put an end to this dog. No question, I know my husband.  This leaves me with a responsible feeling for all this. responsible for the problem, and the answer.  Even with all the crying and biting Allison of coarse at four  does not want him to go to a new home. Even though I am a grown woman I can also hear some of my family shaming me for having this dog and then giving him away.  I feel so guilty already!  The thought is breaking my heart! I really want us to have a family dog. Just not such a big and strong dog that bites! I am not making any decision just yet.  We'll see how things go after the move.

      1. How fricking old I feel after moving two truck loads of boxes yesterday. 2. That my dog wont stop biting and scratching us. 3. That the same dog has been digging to China in our yard, and I am worried he is going to trash our new one as well. 4. I have to do something about my car that wont run, I can't let it just sit here forever. 5. I really need to do some packing before I  go to my nephews Birthday Party this afternoon. 6. I think I should just go back to bed for a while.

          Yay! I am starting this entry with my happy dance man! Both closing went perfect yesterday. Very smooth without a problem.  We are now the new owners of a three bedroom brick home with a garage in Allen Park. Yay! I will be so happy to move off this busy street with no driveway, I cant even tell ya!   The woman we bought the house from could not have been any sweeter. She left the house very clean and ready for us. She liked us so much that she invited us and our girls to visit her in the Smokey Mountains where is just had a house built.  She handed us the keys at closing which was nice. We had a blast checking everything out last night and planning where to put our stuff.  Today it is going to pay off having a teenage daughter,  she and her bestfriend are helping me load and unload a ton of boxes.  I also have to visit our credit union and do a change of address  and order new checks. I can't wait to be done with all the small details now.  Of coarse my Ying Yang always has to follow me. I really wish it wouldn't. I was already to go to the closing of our house yesterday morning, had Allison all packed in the car for Nana's house and  my lovely SUV wouldn't start. I was so upset, of all days! Thankfully my very happy to do it Step Dad gave me a lift. I am not looking forward to dealing with that thing, so I drove Gerry to work today and will deal with the pissy mobile tomorrow.

       urlLink Allison  posted that she wonders if she'll still have a blog when she's 80? Funny, I can see us all in the nursing homes getting fed our dinner and  bitching because the internet is down. Blogging about our meds and  bingo night in the cafeteria. he he... just a funny thought.  I am feeling much better today then I was yesterday, no need to open a bottle of wine with breakfast. Our buyer has agreed to holding some money to make sure the  couple of things get done on the furnace.  My husband should have them ready for the city to come back Monday.  sheeesh I was freakin' So this time tomorrow, I will be signing this house away. Crazy.

      I am freaking out! The city inspector was here this morning to check out the new furnace. He first said I need another permit, the one I have doesn't even cover the furnace or duct work. WTF? How would I know, I went to city hall, told them my husband is putting in a new furnace and I signed it and wrote a check.  Geesh you would think that would be their mistake! Anyway, I can handle that part, I'll go to city hall tomorrow no problem.  He then rattled off a couple of changes my husband needs to make, and then he'll have to come back. OMG changes, we are set to close on Thursday,  we don't have time for changes. I was so worried something like this would happen. My realtor said the buyer could postpone the closing until it's done, and then we wait for another opening to close both houses. I am hoping the changes are something simple that Gerry can do after work tomorrow, but that still does not clear us for closing Thursday.  There is also a chance that the buyer will take a couple hundred dollars at closing from us until it is all cleared, this of course is what I am hoping for!  I have the movers, cable, phone company all set up.  I am going to really freak out if we have to move our closing date  by more than a day or two. I am trying not to count the minutes until Gerry gets home from work, so I can tell him all of this and he can explain what type of job this is big or small. I have already read all my blog list and am now starting to eat everything in sight. aaaacckk!

      My Monday turned out to be not so bad. Allison is feeling better, not herself yet but better. She's still home with me today.  My calls went very smooth! We are all set up. We should be all moved into the new house a week from Friday.  Also had a very nice evening,  a nice dinner, with my wonderful husband, and a very nice bottle of Lambrusco. For someone who doesn't drink very often I am turning in to such a  wine-o! I was thinking about it yesterday,  I believe I have bought four bottles over the past two weeks.  Damn, no wonder I have no money.  My goals for today: Do my usual online job search. Clean out our bedroom closet and pack it up. More packing in the basement. Sort through a pile of papers that has been  sitting on our dresser for over two months. Clean the kitchen floor. Wash Max's blanket, it sticks like dog.

      Allison is still sick. She seemed to be better and  then started throwing up again, one stubborn bug. I am giving her until this afternoon and  then taking her to the doctor if she's still sickly. I only have about  fifty  calls to make this morning. I hope I make them between puking times,  with my luck I'll be on hold with the electric company for an hour  and they'll pick up as soon as I set the phone down to help Alli.  To top it off, I am on my forth day with no sleep and not by my own doing. I can handle insomnia, in fact I do every few month's. If feels so much worse when it's other things  that keep waking you up over and over. Anyone want a cat? I really hate her today.

      Boxes, boxes everywhere! I can't tell you how many times I have bumped into them. I'll be taking most of the boxes over to the new house Friday morning. Both girls are going to spend the day with me over there cleaning  and getting the house ready. It should be fun, I am sure Bethany will have the CD's unpacked first to listen to.  Allison is getting pretty excited and can't wait to see her new room.  Poor baby has been sick over the weekend. She is just now keeping down crackers and water  for the first time since Friday night. It's so sad when little kids are sick.  She got into bed with me this morning as her Dad left for work at 4:00am and was just the cutest sweetest  little thing,  laying there on his big pillow all smiles. Reminded me of how small she really is still. What a nice way to wake up this morning.

      When Gerry is working a lot of hours, which is most of the time, I do as much of the little things I can for him, like pick up cards and gifts. At first I would only pick up things for other family members, not my self. I mean who wants to pick up their own birthday or Christmas gifts,  what fun is that? Yeah, I am over that feeling. Have been for about a year now. Now I just go shopping get something I want and  tell him, thank you, you were very generous with a kiss. With him working seven days a week right now,  I get to play Cupid today. He will have Happy Valentines Day cards for both girls  and some thing cute to give them tonight at dinner. As for me, he bought me one of my very favorite movies on DVD.     Thanks Honey, I love it! I hope everyone has a Sweet Valentines Day.

      Friday the 13th has always been good luck for me. I don't know, good things just happen to me on this day. Like the first date I had with my husband.  Today when I went to pay for insurance on the new house, a few of the women in the office and I started chatting and kidding around. I some how let out that I was looking for a job, and that I have been a stay at home mom for a while. Well it just so happened they are looking for a new receptionist. The woman I was chatting with just so happen to be the office manager and gave me an application to fill out while I was there. The office is just minutes from out new house. I have a good feeling about this one, and am really hoping to hear from them.

      OMG it's 10:30am already! I haven't done a thing, no packing, no laundry, nothing. I blame my fat loud mouth cat! The bitch woke me up four times last night.  I have never wanted throw her ass out side so bad.  No, I would never do that, its below freezing out there.  I even tried locking her in Allison's empty room last night, she banged on the door for an hour until I finally let her out,  then to get  back at me by waking up the dog.  He saw her eating the food I gave her at 2:00am to  shut her up and started to wine for food,  so after just getting back into bed again, I had to get up and feed him.  My husbands alarm goes off at 2:30am, and it takes me until 3:00am to get him up for work. I finally fell back asleep around 4:00am  and the dog needed to go out from eating in the middle of the night. It was like living on the funny farm. They are both sleeping now,  now that I have to shower and have some running around to this morning. They both better just stay away from me today!

      I have to laugh at KFC,  first they took the fried out of their name from Kentucky Fried Chicken to just KFC,  so we would forget it's bad for us. Since that didn't fool anyone, we still know its fried food.  They are calling their chicken  urlLink Kitchen Fresh Chicken .  How funny is that? Did they change the chicken?  Is it still finger licking good? It is still the same greasy fried chicken that we have had around since we were kids.

I cant believe how much junk has been stuffed in to this little house over seven years. I am even thinking of putting some stuff on eBay tomorrow.  Anyone have any tips?  I should hear by tomorrow a confirmed closing day and time, we are all betting on Tuesday or Wednesday.  What a long day that will be, we're closing on this house in the morning, and the new one in the afternoon. Long but exciting!

We got the call yesterday that we are all set to close! We should have the new keys in our hand with in a week. I still just cant believe it! As excited as I am to move into a bigger house, and a better neighborhood, I am sad to leave this one. I am really trying not to be so emotional,  but I guess that just wouldn't be me now, would it?

      Another week just flew by me.   I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, I am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from Wednesday.  I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with Bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately.  Here's my rundown; Last night we watched Thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then I expected.  Then we watched Gigli,  yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves.  Underworld - I thought it was okay, didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  There was just something too laughable about vampires with cellphones to me. I guess I am more of a traditional vampire fan.  Cabin Fever - didn't care for this either, only wasted about 40 minutes of my time.  Feddie VS Jason - I really liked it! I thought it was a lot of fun how they blended the first two movies together. If you watch this one, just don't get up and walk away until the credits are rolling or you'll miss one of the funniest endings.  Once Upon A Time In Mexico - I love it!  A fun movie with true Johnny Depp style and humor.  Open Range - I missed most of this movie, but it looked pretty good.

      My nephew is over for a visit and the kids are playing nice. Allison's bedroom floor is already covered with all her toys,  which I think means they are having a good time.  It's the pets in this house that are driving me nuts!  My fat cat did everything she could to get me out of bed this morning at 4:00am to fill her food dish.  When nothing worked she woke the dog! I was so mad, I thought for sure his barking would wake the kids and then I would have been really screwed.  She won again, I was up out of my warm bed at 4:30am. feeding them both to shut them up. So, now at 9:30am I am ready for a nap, or is it too early for a drink?

      Gerry and I had a great time last night. While Allison spent the night with her grandma,  we went out and played grown ups. It really felt great! Not a Chicken Nugget in sight. We went to Damons for dinner and drinks. Not drinking much anymore their huge Margaritas really did the trick. So I was feeling pretty good. After that we came home and drank a little more while we curled up with  urlLink Kevin . It's kinda nice having the new T.V. in the bedroom. Right now the huge thing is sitting at the end of the bed, like a drive in. Sorry I can't tell you if the movie was any good. But I can tell that we had a good time.

Things are going great with the house and moving. I really am excited about it. Maybe its because I still don't have a job?  I must have sent out 25 or 30 resumes so far. Maybe it's because I have gained a little weight,  damn chips & salsa! Pure Evil, I tell ya! Maybe it's because I miss my husband,  Gerry is working 12 hrs a day 7 days a week right now. Or maybe it's just winter blues?? Damn Groundhog, another evil! What ever it is I am sure I'll work it out,  I have too much to be happy about to let myself get depressed.

      Over the weekend Allison and I made a quick stop in a grocery store in Ecorse. Ecorse is known as a bad neighborhood.  I sometimes don't think of it as that, because years ago I lived there with my first husband.  As I pulled into the parking lot there was a red Mustang on his way out and blocking most of the driveway. After I parked and got Alli out of the car,  the same red Mustang was rolling back into the parking lot and past us,  as he rolled past very slow he was looking at me.  I thought what a fricking weirdo.  After walking around the store, taking our time shopping and going through the checkout the man was still sitting in the parking lot when we came out.  I acted like I did notice, and buckled up Allison in the back seat and started the car to warm it up.  Then as I started to unload the buggy, and I heard "excuse me" from the man in the car. I turned thinking does the weirdo know me? Do you have any change? I am running out of gas, he said. I started digging in my coat pockets, like I was looking as I walked a little closer to him, saying no I don't have any change. He quickly said, anyway don't I know you?  Don't you work at so an so's office? I could barely hear him. He just kept talking. I had this strange feeling, like he was trying to keep my attention. I looked back and there was another man walking towards my running car with Allison in it. I told him, "you don't know me" and darted back into the car!  I looked back to see if the two men where talking like they knew each other,  but the red Mustang was gone, gone like fast!  I don't know if they where together and looking for a car to steal or what,  but it was enough to freak the shit out of me.  I will never turn my back on my daughter again,  I will never start the car with her in it again.   I hope I am wrong and it was my imagination,  but I really believe in that gut feeling.  I always say it's there for a reason.

Afterwards we came home. He hadn't seen it,  so I popped in  urlLink School Of Rock  and we laughed out loud! I am so surprised at how much I love that movie. Anyway we had a much needed fun time.   I should be pretty busy all day. I am trying to get as much done around here as  I can before starting my new job on Thursday.  I still have to unpack my work clothes,  and see what still fits.  I am thinking not much will. It's been a while. So I may have to do a little shopping.  My plan is to get everything done today and tomorrow, so I have Wednesday to chill while the kids are in school.

      The  urlLink job I really wanted  but it didn't pay enough  called me back and made me a second offer. She was very sweet, said they really wanted me to join their team. Said I would really fit in and have a  chance to do some fast moving up in the office. She offered me a little more money then before  and my choice of hours. The pay is still not great but being part time and  working the wonderful hours of 8:30am to 1:00pm  I wont have to pay for any daycare when school starts back up and I will be home nice and early to do homework and make dinner before it's bedtime. I am really excited about it.  It sounds just what I was looking for. Oh and I timed three minutes from my driveway to the office. I can deal with that!

      My day started with a phone call  from the woman who adopted Max. Telling me they had a ruff night and she has to bring him back. OMG! My four year old is still crying out the window for him. How hard is it going to be to have him here  and then send him away again? So, I told Allison Max is coming back but he can't stay. That went over really well. A half hour later she called me back, saying she jumped the gun  and is giving it a couple more days to see how it goes. Okay, so then I had to tell Allison, he is NOT coming back. OIY! That was even more fun!  Now that I think about it, I expect him back by Monday. If he does come back, that's it! I can't go through this again.  We will just have to work it out. He will have to mainly be an outside dog until  I can get Allison to really understand things. We'll have to take him to special dog classes for these problems. I guess we'll see.

      It is a beautiful rainy day here in Michigan. I wish I could lay around all day watching movies on the couch. I have about six different places I have to be today  and none of them are in the livingroom.  I cant believe the weekend is here already,  my week just flew by. I am sure the next couple of days will be even faster. I have four online projects to keep me busy . All of which I am hoping to have done my Monday,  well, maybe Monday night.

      After turning two people away,  and one of them not being very nice about it. I found Max a good home. The family has always had two dogs until  one passed away not too long ago      . Leaving their lab lonely. The woman was here with her dog this afternoon  and the two seemed to get along very well. They live in a good size house near by with a very large yard. She told me they also spend a lot of time on their boat, Max being a mix of two water dogs will love that.  Damn, I am going to miss him something horrible! Allison is not going to take this very well either, tonight is going to be a hard one.

      I woke up with a pounding headache this morning. I don't know if it's sinus or a tooth that needs some attention. I hate the dentist, I mean I really hate it! But I guess I better make that call today. How can I teach my girls to take care of their teeth if I don't. I think I am going to pop some pills and lay on the couch while I can. Thank Goddess today is a school day!

      I have an ad in the paper today,  looking for a new home for Max. Monday morning he snapped at Allison again  for walking in the room  and nipped her in the face this time.  Last time he broke the skin on her arm.  As much as I love him,  I can't have a pet in the house that  I am too scared to leave alone with our daughter. Even if she does love him. The whole thing is just so upsetting.

          The Spring Equinox is a traditional time for many Witches to perform blessings over the seeds which they gathered in the fall of the previous year, though store-bought packets of seeds may be blessed as well. Perform the blessing at sunset in the center of a clockwise-cast circle. Place the seeds to be blessed in a basket or cauldron. If the seeds are contained within a packet, place the entire packet of seeds in the basket or cauldron. Using an athame or wand, thrice draw a pentagram in the air over the seeds, and say: "As winter's reign comes to an end and spring brings warmth and light, the spirit of these seeds I do call forth onOstara's sacred night. From your rest awaken now with birth! You shall, in time, grow green and strong in the soil of Mother Earth. So mote it be!"  By: Gerina Dunwich

      I said I was going to last night. Curled up on the couch and watched  urlLink 21 Grams  again. I have to say I appreciated it much more the second time. Knowing the story already,  I was able to really understand the first 20 minutes,  instead of piecing it together.  Tomorrow night I am renting  urlLink School Of Rock.  I am really looking forward to it, after PMSing all week. I am ready for a good laugh.

Funny, yeah, not really but, they also have the same last name as each other! Luckily for me one sends emails under Jen H@@@@ and the other  shows up from Jennifer H@@@@.  Jen, Jennifer OIY.  I hope I don't get confused on who wants what they are very different!

      I am surprised at how I am feeling this week. I really didn't think passing the due date would be so hard. He is gone no matter what date is on the calendar just like the day before and the day after. But today I will remember his wiggles and kicks inside of me. The sight of his little face and little hands.  I am thankful that he wasn't born with problems and had to suffer.  I am very thankful that he took care of the problem for me,  and that we didn't have to make the decision to abort.  I would still be questioning and punishing myself.  I am going to try and have a good afternoon today. A little house cleaning and maybe a quiet nap. Dwelling on what could have been or  even what should have been is just a big waste of energy.  Today I will remember him but not dwell on him.

      I had another sleepless night last night. I even tried taking a hot bath around 1:00am.  It only worked until I got out of the tub. I tried T.V., I watched  urlLink The Rookie  and loved it.  I also watched for the fourth time urlLink   Life As A House , what a great movie.  Another movie about life to learn from.   Today was suppose to be the day I start back on a normal routine. Gerry at work, the girls both in school.  I even planned on getting up early and  getting myself together so  I can enjoy my day and be more productive. NOT! Allison and I both over slept by an hour and a half.  I looked out side and it's snowing, really snowing. I hate to be late,  I need a schedule even when I am not going to work everyday.

      Allison and I did our morning exercises before breakfast,  not a lot but it's a start. After lunch we spent the afternoon bumming around Target.  Where I picked up this great three wick candle for our dining room table, it has three shades of cream and brown, and a vanilla sent.  The downer of today is that, as hard as it is we have decided that Max has to go to a new home. He is a very smart and lovable dog  with adults ,  but we think he needs to be with a family with out small kids. Yesterday while in the bathroom,  I heard a deep growl come from him followed by a bark,  and then not even a second later Allison crying.  I don't know what she did or didn't do ,  when I left the room just seconds ago she was watching T.V. She got lucky! Max only left a scrape and small bruises on her arm. It could have been a lot worse.  We do punish her for hitting or not leaving the dog alone,  but I don't think there is anyway a four year old can  really understand what could happen. My gut tells me that we are making the right decision,  even though it is breaking my heart.  Things I am thankful for : 1. My healthy and happy girls, give in, I know. 2. My wonderful family 3. Our new house, I am loving it so far. 4. Thankful to have most of our debt paid off, as of selling our old house. 5. The bottle of wine I am about to open before I go soak in a hot bath.

      A mission to take better care of myself, to feel better about myself. A mission to get through this week with no signs of depression. It's not going to be easy,  add major PMS with what was  urlLink my due date  March 17th, and the odds are against me. I am not going to let it happen. Here is a list of some of the steps I am taking: 1. I am going back to exercising every morning, starting tomorrow. 2. I am going to cook nice dinners for family every evening this week. 3. I am going to pamper myself at night with hot baths, candle light and music. 4. I am going to set aside some me time, to meditate, to focus. 5. I am also going to list in my blog five things I am thankful for everyday this week.

      I had a night of hell last night, and I think I may still be there? Not only am I PMSing something bad and got NO sleep, Allison was up chasing the dog by 7:00am and Bethany was up fighting with her best friend by 7:30am. So I am locking myself in the computer room and catching up on all my blogging friends. In fact I may never leave this room again. Maybe if I turn on some music,  I wont hear another scream for mom,  moooom ?   On days like this I believe brownies are a suitable breakfast.

      Allison is in the living room with her Dad and I just heard her say; "Daddy, don't call them, they will take  all  your money!" referring to an infomercial. he he he... She then explained,  my Nana said so. Kids remember everything.  I on the other hand have unpacked three more boxes and still no flippin' computer cord for my camera.  I think I may have to order a new one but you know what will happen then? I'll find the damn thing.

      We had a great time last night when my  urlLink sister ,  her boyfriend and my handsome little nephew came for dinner. Allison couldn't wait for them to get here to show off her new bedroom,  she is so proud. It makes her dad and I feel so good she feels that way  after leaving the only home she as ever known.   The sun is out but it is still very cold here in Michigan. From the inside it looks like a very nice spring day,  so I have every single blind open to let in some sunshine.  Allison and I are pulling out all of our little Easter decorations  and finding places for them in our new home. It feels really good.   We were up and out early this morning for some running around and now  we have the whole afternoon to listen to some music and clean house. Maybe even fit in a little nap? I love these days.

I am spending the morning unpacking and sorting more stuff, will it ever end? And the afternoon cooking a nice meal for my  urlLink sister  and her family who are coming to dinner tonight. I am really looking forward to spending some time with them.  After dinner we are planning a game of  urlLink Trivia Pursuit   while the little ones play. I do believe I see  urlLink strawberry margaritas  some where in the picture as well.  A big T.G.I.F. ! to all my working blogging buddies!

      The job interview went very well. The only draw back is that the pay is very low, half of what I was making before I quit my job. After taxes and daycare I would only be making about twenty bucks a week. Sheeesh, I almost spend that in make up and hair spray alone when I am working.  So Allison and I spent the afternoon baking some sweets for Dad. We made yellow cake with chocolate frosting just covered  in rainbow sprinkles( mom's fav) and fudge brownies. Our house smells so good right now. I would insert a picture right here,  but I still have not found my computer cord for the camera. If anyone knows where it is, pleeeease let me know,  I am getting really pissed!

      and I am  up online sitting in my new computer room, with a  bag of Salsa Bugles and drinking Mountain Dew. I usually only drink diet pop, not the hard stuff. I am  never  going to sleep!! It's been a long time since I have been up this late.  Gerry and I spent the day finishing up the work that needed to be done at our old house and turned in the keys this evening. I am so glad to be done with everything,  now we can concentrate on unpacking and finding places for all of our things here. I can't wait to have everything in order.  After turning in the keys, we ordered pizza and a movie. I picked out  urlLink Matchstick Men .  I don't recommend it.   I have so much to do tomorrow I really should be sleeping. I am sure to regret this, but I think I need more Dew.

      Why do I drink and save? Every time I have a few drinks and use the computer I save all kinds of shit in my documents. Last night I had a little too much wine, and while sitting here I must have saved twenty or more pictures of Benicio Del Toro. WTF for? Do I see a Benicio layout in my future? I think so.  Atleast I don't drink and blog, that would be scary.

      Today is our last day of working on our old house before turning over the keys. With our families knowing each other, I am making sure each room is well cleaned. Don't need any finger pointing while we are up north at the same camp ground. So my day will be filled with moping the kitchen floor, one last scrub on the bathroom and cleaning the living room carpet.  But for now, life is quiet as I shake my bag of trail mix over my mouth for breakfast and do some blog reading.

      and I don't know where to start. It's been such a busy week my head is spinning.  Well, we are all moved in and far from all unpacked. I don't know how such a small family can have so much stuff?  So far we couldn't be happier with the new house,  it felt like home right from the first night. I am slowly getting use to all the creeks, bumps and sounds in the night. Wondering if they have a reason or purpose? Silly, but fun.  I'll post more later, I have lots of catching up to do! Thanks for all the nice comments and emails, it really made me feel good to turn on my computer and read them all.

This is what they told me are to be found in our new backyard. They make such a good pair  seeing how my daughter is the farthest thing from a girly girl.

      I updated my daughters photo page with  a few new things she left on my computer over the weekend. This time she not only left beautiful pictures, but some she messed with in Photosop. I thought they were fun enough to share.   urlLink Check her out

      but thank you for all the nice comments on my new Spring Layout. I liked the template when I saw it,  but still have to get use to such a girlie / flowery look.

      For some reason since changing to this template, I can no longer get my links to open in a new window? Even when I write the HTML right in the post! WTF! I don't get it.  Anyway, if this site goes a little crazy for a day or two, hang with me, I am going to be making the switch over to Movable Type. Thanks to my lovely new host  urlLink Allison.

      I have only had my job for less than two weeks,  and I already don't want to go in tomorrow. Sad, huh? I am stressing about Monday mornings already and I only work 4.5 hours a day. I am so lazy!

      I am so excited about  urlLink this!  I wish I didn't have to wait till June. I just today at the dinner table told my Mom that if it ever came out on DVD, I would have to have the whole first season. YAY!    I can't wait!

      After baking a few Easter  urlLink treats  for tomorrow, I decided to ditch the housework and take Allison to see  urlLink Ella Enchanted . I had no idea that  urlLink Anne Hathaway  was so beautiful! I have never seen her in anything before  that I know of.  The movie was very cute, we both loved it. what's not to love when you have, a beautiful girl, a dreamy prince, evil king fairy's, a bunch of olgers, giants, and elves, and a lot of really good music. I plan on picking the sound track to this one.

      I am feeling a little silly this morning. After going a few weeks without, I have drank way too much wine over the past two nights. Thursday was fine,  I stayed away from the computer. Not last night. As a couple of people know.  I have to thank my good friend Jamie, if it wasn't for our three hours of chatting, I would have drank and blogged. She kept me busy and I had a fun time. I walked away with only sending out two emails, sorry Sis.  Now I have to get moving. Today is all about cleaning the house, coloring eggs, and baking.

      who loves the  urlLink Power Rangers,  and who sleeps with a   urlLink hard plastic Spiderman who is missing one arm . Told me today that she wants  urlLink this for  her birthday. Yay! A reminder that she is in deed a little girl. I love it that she is how her teacher put it, "well rounded" but once in a while Mama needs to know there is a girl in there somewhere.

      is the day I am taking Allison out for a haircut and  doing all my shopping for the week  and for Easter dinner. I am so happy to have this day off,  I guess their are some benefits to  working for a small christian family. Thank you!  I am all ready for you Easter Bunny, baskets are full and hid in the computer closet, and a whole two days ahead of things. This surprises even myself! I am usually a last minute mom, staying up way too late the night before to finish things up. Bring it Bunny, that's what I say this year, BRING...IT...ON!

      after all the comments and tons of emails  from my wonderful readers/ friends to help me sort this out.  I think I am going to renew this domain. I feel so silly now. Like an idiot.  I guess I needed to talk it out with people. I am like that. I am also very fitting of this domain, even if I don't per say practice witchcraft. I love so many pagan and witch things, that this domain is still fitting. I have never used withy as a name, I always post and sign using my real name Jenn. But I just cant imagine blogging on any other domain right now. I love this one, so there. For the stupid, fuckhead who had to  put all this in my head by emailing me to ask why I waste such a domain . Screw you! If you don't like it, don't come back! Also the creep who left me a few comments, they were easily deleted, find something better to do with your time. Love, This Weeks Drama Queen, Jenn!

      I am over thinking things? (meaning my last 2 posts) Do I have to be a practicing witch to keep the name witchymom?  Maybe I am letting a couple of bad comments  and an email get to me too much? Who cares what others think.  I mean Susan over at Easybake Coven is not Pagan, and when she asked I said  "who cares, I love the name of your site" " I wouldn't change it" now here I am thinking and feeling the same way. geeesh... I don't know.  I have a couple of weeks to think about it, then if I am moving I want to have a link up.

      I think was a little misleading.  I have never believed in God. I do believe we as a people were created by a female. I believe that our energy as a person can do amazing things. I also believe we get this from the earth. Weather for you it is praying, or spells? It can be very powerful.  I myself have never followed any path of any kind, and am not looking to.  I find my strength when I need it, in the love of my family and within myself and knowing that I am a good person.  I do not believe in telling others how to live their life  and in return do not want others to tell me!! I guess,  I just don't believe that there is a  being up there ready to give me forever happiness, as long as I follow what they say or I will burn. I think we are rewarded and also  pay for things right here in our life, on earth. Is that karma? I sure don't know. I by far do not have all the answers. But I am happy with my life, and who I am and know that even though I do like a lot of the Pagan  things and ideas, I am not a witch and  even though I like this domain name, it seems to be misleading people. So,  I am going to change it to something move versatile, something more me I guess.

      Well my domain is almost up, one more month to go. I do know I want a new one. (I am planning on bouncing a few  ideas off some of you good friends out there.)  I love how catchy and cute Witchymom is, and I love witchy things, but... it is just not me.  Even though I enjoy and  find comfort in some Pagan beliefs, I am not a witch. I have so many lovely witchy friends, but have always since childhood been an atheist. (meaning no religion) I have never believed in God or  followed a religion in my life.  I have always been respectful and  supportive to my friends and family members who do have religion in their life and at times very envious, no matter what their beliefs are.   Aaaa...  more on this later, what a confusing subject, I am!    Anyway, I hope no matter where I move my little blog, all my wonderful reader/friends will follow me.

      Bethany and I rented a couple of flicks lately and  I forgot to post what I thought of them.  First was  urlLink Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  It scared the piss out of me, there is no other way of saying it and I had my blanket over my face,  a lot.  I think I may be getting too old for these kind of movies?  Then we watched  urlLink Duplex.  I know it didn't do well in the theaters, but I really like it. I thought it was cute, it made me laugh out loud.

      Well, I made it through my first Monday. Today was very boring. My four and a half hours moved by pretty slow and being sleepy didn't help it. I sure hope it gets busier then it was today, or I am not going to last very long.  Now I get to wait for Gerry to get home and  go do our taxes. After paying out a couple of years in a  row, this always stressful.

      I am sitting here thinking, I can't believe I have to get up  and leave early in the morning. I have to get Allison up and leave the house by 7:45am. Wow, I haven't had to think about a Monday morning in a long time. At least I get to leave the office at 1:00pm. But still I have to be up and moving,  and dressed with makeup on. Not what I have gotten use to.

      Yesterday started with a call from my parents  with the sad news that a cousin of mine had passed  away the night before.  A cousin that was very special to me  and very close with my Dad  who is not taking it very well.  I feel so bad for my Aunt,  it is so unnatural to loose a child even at any age. My cousin was around ten years older then me so at seven or eight she was the most beautiful and  cool chick I knew. After having a ruff ride with cancer  over the past ten years  and a lot of other major health issues from it, I sure hope she is at peace.

      I have been so sick to my stomach. A headache too. Maybe I am allergic to work?  he he he Ya never know?  Really, my first two days went very well. Starting this Monday I am part time. 8:30am to 1:00pm which is fine with me.  Today after work Gerry took me to  urlLink Applebees   for dinner and a big fat Strawberry Margarita! I had a steak and Coconut shimp  which was very good, too good  now I am so full all I wont to do is fall asleep and I cant. I have to pick Bethany up  from her job bagging groceries and drop her off at her best friends  house for the night in an hour.  Here are a couple of cute pictures of the two of them:

      Okay my first day of work was pretty good. I think I am going to really like it. The job its self is a breeze. The women are all nice and seem fun to work with. My only worry is that they dress very nice. Not just nice work cloths,  but very nice expensive suites. Their casual Friday is what I am used  to wearing to work every other day. The pay is so low, this worries me a bit. I guess I'll give it a while and see if the job goes anywhere.  I don't know why but I came home with a bad backache. I mean it really hurts. All I did was sit on my butt for eight hours, and answer the phone. I have sat here on the net longer then that! I think I am going to soak in a hot bath, and lay on the couch for a while.
