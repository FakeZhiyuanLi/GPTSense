      I Can't Go There  by Kenny Chesney  Kenny Chesney & Tim McGraw  (Kenny) You know that restaurant on highway one With the key lime pie, that song, the sand and the sun Where we ran in our barefeet Built a castle on the beach Just the wind, the rocks, the waves and you and me.  Chorus: (Both) I can't go there 'Cause thats just too much us I can't go there I still feel your touch Theres places in my heart and head  That feel as empty as our bed So most nights I dont even walk upstairs 'Cause I can't go there.  (Tim) Remember San Francisco on that cable car Our reflection in the window of that store How we danced the night away With the lights out on the bay Then wound up in a blanket on the floor.  Chorus: (Both) I can't go there 'Cause 'Friscos too much, us I can't go there I still feel your touch Now theres places in my heart and head That still feel as empty as our bed So most nights I dont even walk upstairs 'Cause I can't go there.  If it was only Florida or California  Maybe I could let myself move on But its everywhere we've been And everywhere I turn I can't love again  Because I've learned.  That I can't go there  It's somethin' I can't do I can't go there 'Cause I'll run into you I can't go there.  (Tim) When the sun shines, when it rains Christmas parties, football games (Kenny) I can't go there (Tim) Winter, summer, fall or spring I see you in everything I can't go there.  It's too much us I can't go there...

      Ryan, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just can’t quite get that day out of my head. We sat there talking about nothing in particular just like always.&nbsp; I had to leave rather quickly though for basketball practice, we said “later” to each other not knowing it would be the last later.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night your friend and your bother proceded to hurt me physically and with words like “leave you stupid whore”.&nbsp; I did what I thought was best at the time.&nbsp; I now know that it wasn’t the best thing to do.&nbsp; I never wanted to get Tyler involved with it.&nbsp; I just wanted Jermey to get what he deserved.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About three weeks went by without us saying word to each other.&nbsp; Then I saw you and all I wanted to do was talk to you and you wouldn’t even look at me.&nbsp; My heart sank I said things that weren’t nice but it’s what I felt.&nbsp; I felt this whole thing was stupid.&nbsp;  Once again I thought how was this all my fault when all I did was stand up to myself.&nbsp; I was scared of Jermey never leaving me alone when I would see him at school or your house.&nbsp; So I did what I did, I defended myself the best I knew how to.&nbsp; You may not realize that I tried walking away from the situation and when I did they continued doing what they did. Not a day goes by where I don’t think about that night.&nbsp; I also go a day without thinking about our 12 years of friendship gone down the drain.&nbsp; I had to take down things that reminded me of you.&nbsp; I tore the picture of us up.&nbsp; I couldn’t even think of spiderman without thinking, “that’s Ryan’s favorite super hero”.&nbsp; Nor can I listen to “melt”, by Rascal Flatts because that song takes me to last summer with you and Jeff.&nbsp; When Jeff and you threw me in the pool. I don’t think anyone understands why I miss you so much but its because we were friends for 12 years.&nbsp; You were my big brother.&nbsp; There are times when I think god what I wouldn’t give to hear his sigh of boredom or his laugh or even his smile.&nbsp; The fact that me and you aren’t talking is killing me inside.&nbsp; I think I’m ok one minute then I hear some song or watch some show and it reminds me of you.&nbsp; It’ll be 6 weeks on the 28th since it all happned.&nbsp; I want you to know that I am sorry things ended they way they have.&nbsp; I also want you to know that I want us to be friends again.&nbsp; Even though I know that’s just wishful thinking.&nbsp; Take this letter how ever you want to take it, but take it with the knowledge that I am not the same without you in my life.&nbsp; A part of me is gone and it will be gone until we can be friends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em Feel free to call me on my cell phone: 484-8871.

      I just found this old picture in my wallet  Of you and me, down in Mexico  Just look at us there on that beach, on that blanket  That look on our face says all that you need to know   Seems like everywhere we go baby, love goes  Everywhere, everytime our hearts meet, love is all around us  Every road we take, darlin love takes  Every turn, livin right inside us  I believe love goes  Everywhere we go   Sometimes I dream, we're alone on an island  Nowhere to go, we don't want to leave  All we have is a world full of time  We spend it all on you and me  It's all we need   Seems like everywhere we go baby, love goes  Everywhere, everytime our hearts meet, love is all around us  Every road we take, darlin love takes  Every turn, livin right inside us  I believe love goes  Everywhere we go   I'm so alive when I'm near you  This fire in my heart lights my world when I'm with you   Every road we take, darlin love takes  Every turn, livin right inside us  I believe love goes  Everywhere we go   I believe love goes, everywhere we go  Everywhere we go

      I Will Stand by Kenny Chesney I will not be the one Who turns his back and runs When things get rocky down the line And I will not be the one Holdin' the smokin' gun If our love don't stand the test of time  I'll love you forever I will be your man Beside you always I will stand  I didn't say "I do" To take control of you I have no chains to hold you down If you'll let me spread my wings You'll get the best of me Deep in your heart is where I'm bound  I will not forsake you I will take your hand Beside you always I will stand  No matter what happens This feeling will stay Till the day that I die You'll fill up the heart of my soul That I'll take to the other side  And you'll be the only one When all is said and done I'll keep you close to me I swear If ever you are down No need to look around Just close your eyes and I'll be there  I'll love you forever I will be your man Beside you always I will stand

      Because of Your Love  by Kenny Chesney Baby I don't understand How just the touch of your hand can make me feel...invincible.  Do you know just where you take me? Do you know how high you make me? I need your kiss, like oxygen. With your arms warm around me When your eyes look deep into me It's unstoppable Baby anything is possible Chorus: Everything I wanna be, any dream I wanna dream, I can because of your love. Anywhere I ever go, with all of my heart I'll know I am the man that I am,  Because of your love. Don't know how I lived before you Now I live to explore you Take me girl, to your secret world. Where I can swim in your deep blue passion Where I can feel your love come crashing over me...endlessly. Whether your right by my side or whether you and I are a million miles apart I can always feel you in my heart.  Chorus 2x  ohhhh baby because of your love

      Blazing Saddles    Jim: The Waco Kid: What did you expect? "Welcome sonny," "Make yourself at home," "Marry my daughter." You've got to remember, that these are just simple farmers, these are people of the land, the common clay of the new west. You know . . . morons.  -----  Bart: Who is this Mongo, anyway?

Are we black?  Bart: Yes we are.  Jim: The Waco Kid: Then we're awake, but we're very puzzled.  -----  Bart: Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care about "where the choo-choo go"?  Mongo: Don't know. Mongo only pawn in game of life.    -----  Hedley Lamarr: Men, you are about to embark on a great crusade to stamp-out runaway decency in the west.

Jim.  -----  Taggart: I know how we can run everyone out of Rock Ridge.  Hedley Lamarr: How?  Taggart: We'll kill the first born male child in every household.  Hedley Lamarr: Too Jewish.  -----  Olson Johnson: Our fathers came across the prairie. Fought, Indians, fought drought, fought locusts, fought Dix. Remember when Richard Dix came in here and tried to take over this town.  -----  Taggart: Send a wire to the main office, and tell them that I said . . . OW!  Lyle: Send wire, main office, tell them I said, "ow." Gotcha.  -----  Gov. William J. Le Petomane: Holy underwear!  -----  Bart: I'm rapidly becoming a big underground success in this town.  Jim: The Waco Kid: Gee, in another twenty-five years you'll be able to shake their hands in broad daylight.  -----  Hedley Lamarr: Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.  Mexican Bandit: Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!    -----  Gov. William J. Le Petomane: Affairs of State, must take precedent over the Affairs of State.  -----  Rev. Johnson: Now, I don't have to tell you good folks, what has been happening here in our beloved little town: sheriff murdered, crops burned, stores looted, people stampeded, and cattle raped.  -----  Mongo: Mongo like candy.    -----  Jim: The Waco Kid: No, no, don't do that, don't do that. If you shoot him, you'll just make him mad.  -----  Howard Johnson: As the chairman of the Welcoming Committee, it is my privilege to extend a laurel, and hearty handshake to our new . . . n****r.  -----  Howard Johnson: You know, Nietzsche says, "Out of chaos comes order."

Bart: Well, once I establish myself in this here town, Deputy Spade might turnout to be a groovy position.  -----  Bart: What is it, that's not exactly water, and it ain't exactly earth?  Bart and Charlie: Quicksand!!!  -----  Bart: Excuse me while I whip this out.    -----  Bart: You know, a man drinks like that and he don't eat, he is going to die.  Jim: The Waco Kid: When?  -----  Hedley Lamarr: My mind is a-glow with whirling transient nodes of thought, careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.  Taggart: Ditto!  -----  Hedley Lamarr: My mind is a raging torrent, flooded with rivulets of thought, cascading into a waterfall of creative alternatives.  Taggart: Gal-darnit, Mr. Lamarr, you use your tongue prettier than a 20-dollar whore.  -----  Bart: Well, can't you see that's the last act of a desperate man?

Cowboy...Cowboy  Well I'm packing up my game and I'm a head out west Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts Find a nest in the hills chill like Flynt Buy an old drop top find a spot to pimp And I'm a Kid Rock it up and down your block With a bottle of scotch and watch lots of crotch Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' chillin the most Then rock that bitch up and down the coast Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars Get thrown in the mix and tossed out of bars Slip to Tiajuana... I wanna roam Find the old town chillin fools then come back home Start an escort service, for all the right reasons And set up a shop at the top of four seasons Kid Rock and I'm the real mccoy And I'm headin' out west sucker... because I wanna be a  Cowboy baby With the top let back and the sunshine shining Cowboy baby West coast chillin with the Boone's Wine I wanna be a Cowboy baby Ridin at night cause I sleep all day Cowboy baby I can smell a pig from a mile away  I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin when my train rolls in It goes (whistle) like dust in the wind Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind I once was lost, but now I'm just blind Palm trees and weeds, scampees and rice Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss And if the price is right I'm gonna make my bid boy And let Cali-for-ny-aye know why they call me  Cowboy baby With the top let back and the sunshine shining Cowboy baby West coast chillin with the Boone's Wine I wanna be a Cowboy baby Ridin at night cause I sleep all day Cowboy baby I can smell a pig from a mile away  Yeah... Kid Rock... you can call me Tex Rollin sunset woman with a bottle of Becks Seen a slimmy in a vette, rolled down my glass And said, Yeah this dick fits right in your ass No kiddin, gun slingin, spurs hittin the floor Call me Hoss, I'm the Boss, with the sauce and the whores No remorse for the sherrif, in his eye I ain't right I'm gonna paint his town red, and paint his wife white HUH Cause chaos, rock like Amadeus Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit players Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers They told us to leave, but bet they can't make us Why they wanna pick on me... lock me up and snort away my key I ain't no cheat, I'm just a regular failure I ain't straight outta Compton I'm straight out the trailer Cuss like a sailor... drink like a Mick My only word of wisdom are just suck my dick I'm flickin my Bic up and down that coast and Keep on truckin till i fall in the ocean Cowboy With the top let back and the sunshine shining Cowboy Spend all my time at Hollywood and Vine Cowboy Ridin at night cause I sleep all day Cowboy I can smell a pig from a mile away Cowboy With the top let back and the sunshine shining Cowboy With the top let back and the sunshine shining Cowboy Hollywood and Vine

      Well one year ago Emily's purse was stolen,  I think we should have a memorial service for her purse.  I am so happy because tomorrow is the 4th of July and that means FIREWORKS!!!  Well thats all I have to say about that.  Man I am typing really fast lately.  Thats a good thing.
