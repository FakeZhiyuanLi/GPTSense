      Well, i havnt updated in a couple of days because nothing too exciting has happened. Ive been working like crazy to make sure i get my homework done in time for tuesday. I evern have been to the library twice in four days...yes i know, im just cool like that. On thursday i had Tri-S (registration) and a nice Journo meeting. Tri-S wasnt too bad this year; my Id card is just as hott as lost year's. So of course the most exciting part of it this year is the senior room...DISAPOINTING. Our senior t-shirts are ugly as hell. Instead of the kick ass superman style one, we got maroon ones that say "Who's the senior now?" on the front and, wait for it ladies and gents, "ME!" on the back. Very disapointing. The journo meeting countered that though. Im so glad we are starting with a new slate, this year will be amaing. New teacher, new computers, new layout, no censorship, no evil editors!  Friday was a pretty chill day, just went to the library in the day and thenWHAM GOOD STUFF HAPPENS. Like what kind of good stuff? CULLEN GOOD! He came over to watch a movie, but of course nothing ever goes as planned. I hadn't seen Kaitlin or Julia in hecka days and knew i wouldnt be able to see either them on Saturday. So of course once Rory hears im seeing the girls he wants to come. So we all go to dinner and things go well, Cullen says he liked them and i hope he just wasn't syaing that. Of course they LOVED him, how could anyone not? Then we dropped the loud one off and went to La Scala for a bit to see some LL peeps and play cards. I felt really bad bc the game was going crazy and he dindt know how to play and idndt seem like he was having a good time. I kept on asking him if he wanted to leave but he said it was ok, but it wasnt ok bc i wanted to spend some alone time with him. So we go home and watch the movie and talk untill 12ish when he has to go home to my dismay.  Today was just as boring as anyother day. Woke up, washed my car, picked up a book and Elana's and chatted for a bit, then off to the library. I got a good amount of work done but its never seems to end.  Came home, had dinner, talked to cullen!, and then somehting that never happens. For the first time in months, maybe even years, i lost to someone in my family in a boardgame. I curse the creator of Scatagories and swear on his/her grave i will be redeemed. So pretty much an uneventful night. The summer is winding down and i can't deny the fact that i dont want it to be August. I dont want to go back to school. But it is inevitable, and i must do my best to have fun and live it up on the weekends!

      Its less than a week until school starts and im really really behind on my homework. I am not the only one; in fact i havn't seen so many people procrastinate on their summer homework ever. Must be senioritis all ready kicking in. So if you know me and know how i am about school about school work, you'd probably be avoiding me right now. Surprisingly i am completely chill about things now. I'm not saying that things aren't crazy right now, becuase they are, but everything else is going crazy while i sit her completely at ease.  As summer begins to wind down, I am trying to get last breaths of summer freedom. The days of being able to go out till midnight during the week are dwindling in number. Luckily i got Lyndsey to give me a ride to iMusicast after my little car issue. I am so glad she did because when i got there i got to spend a couple solid, yet noisy, hours with Cullen. I am happy whenevere and whereever i get to talk to him. When the night ended and i was walking to his car to get my mix tape/cd, i kept wishing for more time with him. My low self-esteem kicks in as usal and i feel like im smothering him, but i hope im not and hope thatd hed be comfortable enough to tell me if i was. I need to sop worrying but stuff like that, things are going to happen as they are supposed to.  On a completely unrelated note my bulletin board came!!!!!! For some reason i put pictures of hot australian and british popstars on it instead of hot guys. Cullen need not worry though, i pass on pussy.

      well, it was a nice being able to say i was crash free. that has all come to an end now. i was pulling out of the bastard walnut creek target parking lot and wasnt paying enough attention to the location of those horrific support columns. Next thing you know my car is all scrunched up in the front and my head light is hanging by a thread. So who do i call first? The one person i know with the most car accident expirence alive, my sister. Rory grabs the phone from me and tells her "Robert got in a car crash and im in a world of pain." So naturally she freaks out and starts cyring and says she wishes she was there to help me, but eventually i calm her down. So my mom is pissed, my step dad is pissed, i am positive that my car pissed.  Now i have to find out how much its gonna cost to fix and pay half. This is all fine by me, but of course in ym life nothing is ever that simple. After years of escaping confrentatin my dad and Rustyt can no longer avoid it. AND IM IN THE MIDDLE...AGAIN. But life isnt all shitty these days for me. There is a certain special someone, someone who got me to start this so i could leave notes and his. Even though i crashed my car im not down bc i still get to see cullen tonite!
