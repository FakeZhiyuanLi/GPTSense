      I don't make promises to other people frequently.  I know life is unpredictable and I don't want to let people down. Every day I plan 26 hours worth of stuff to do so something is going to get bumped. So when my kidlets say "do you promise, Mommy", I say, "no but I'll try really hard".  When I make a promise.  My word is on the line.  If I promise to be there. I'll be there (of course, if you know me, you know I might be  a couple minutes late).  Why is it then, that promises to myself are taken so much more lightly?  I have promised myself so many things:  to get away from my desk at lunch  to clean out my closet  to take a pottery class  to take time for myself  to work fewer hours  to plan a tropical vacation  I have even started with the big words-- I, Mandy Kolesik, do solemnly swear that I will... Didn't work.  OK. That's it.  I promise to keep more promises to myself. ;)

      Did you ever think civilized society would come to this? Blogs!   Here we all are on our chosen paths-- avoiding any additional stress and information. If it doesn't pertain to our agenda, it is more than we want or need to know. Or is it?    Don't we want to get to know each other, anymore?  To see things just for the sake of seeing them...to meet people just for the pleasure of getting to know one another.. take a little time to smell the roses--the unexpected roses even.    Alas to many of us, any excess information would be past the overload point.    So I post my blog and hope that someone will take a moment to peek out of their rut and see "me".  So here I am how do I look?
