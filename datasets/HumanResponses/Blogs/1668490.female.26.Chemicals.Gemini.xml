      i saw my trophy at absinth last wed, the same night i saw the hoe. anyway, i wuz stoned with 3 valiums and juz ask the people i wuz with how many bottles of beer i had when i ran into cody. damn! he still remembers me but he said didnt wanna go into details as to how and where we met cuz he wuz with his girlfriend. but he still went down memory lane though so as not to hurt my feelings. hehe. ugh!  yeah, the rumors are true, they're official now. i juz wonder how they converse (or in a brotha's lingo: CONVERSATE). aight, im bein harsh.. sorry im jealous, demmet! anyway, we juz talked for a while, nah we didnt really talk. i juz a borrowed a globe phone cuz i had to call customer service cuz my cel wuz stolen. aight, it wuznt my phone but my sim wuz in it so i needed to have it blocked. i know he's still as gorgeous as he wuz the last time i saw him. (forgive me, i dont totally remember now. gimme a break i wuz stoned. and i even thot he wuz wearin a black shirt but my friend said he wuz wearin a white long sleeved polo. haha!) i kept on walkin that night. i wuz lookin for the hoe, lookin for my phone, lookin for the bastard who stole it, lookin for i dunno what. i juz wanted to walk around. on my way inside the club, art saw me. he yelled: CeCe! are u ok? wazzup?? (with his sweetest smile.) i told him i lost my phone. he panicked. he said: how can i call u, baby? gimme ur number now. sheesh! wat a dumb ass! i juz lost my fone right?? anyway, i told him that and he juz gave me a tight hug. i hugged him back. i needed it. it felt good. twas comforting. and i seized the moment cuz he's hardly affectionate and sweet. but i didnt wanna feel it too much so i let go. he asked if i wuz feelin any better and i had to be honest. i said NO cuz it's been years that i havent felt better. damn, he wuz really sweet that night. he kissed me on the forehead and gave me a tight squeeze again. after that, i juz walked away. a few minutes after, i saw my crush. i forget his name now though he already introduced himself. he wuz with a girl. well...he can do better. that's all i can say. hehe.  then i saw peek. he still hates me. i know he still thinks im psycho. aight, cant do nuthin bout it. but if he changes his mind and wants to give me a chance, id definitely be ecstatic! :) my teddy bear wuz also there he juz smiled at me cuz we dunno each other yet. but hell, yeah i wanna know him!   so that's it. the night wuz hella chaotic -- there wuz a fight between david and goliath over mary magdalene, policemen came, a kleptomaniac wuz running around, i wuz preppin myself for a catfight/trash talk wit the hoe but it turned out that i attacked a white bitch screaming her guts out cuz she wuz also a victim of the klepto and so much more..-- but as the song goes.."it's raining men, HALLELUJAH!"

       4.28.04 - wednesday  i saw her. the hoe. finally. face to face. my heart went straight up to my throat. i couldnt breathe. i felt dizzy. vertigo. i felt so sick. i wanted to attack her, smash her head with the bottle of beer i wuz holding. i didnt. too bad.  it wuz a chaotic night. pinoys acting jologs, niggas acting hood rats. hoes finally facing their dooms. different worlds of different peoples clouded the air. but the details surrounding the moment seemed to be in accordance with my emotions though i wuz in my own world. i wuz militant. hate wuz eating me up. i wuz feisty and hostile. i wanted to kill. yeah, i wanted to kill her. if not her i wanted to kill myself. insecurity crept in. it sucks. how can an ugly bitch make me insecure? i dunno the answer. please, someone tell me.

               Q. What is the difference between politicians and stoners ? A. Politicians don't inhale...they just suck.   Did you hear about the stoners that locked their keys in the car? It took them two hours to get out.  Q. How do you get a one armed hippie out of a tree ? A. You pass him a joint.   Q. What do you get when you eat marijuana ? A. A pot belly  Q. What do you call a pot smoker with two spliffs ?  A. Double jointed.  Two stoners are walking down the street and see a dog licking his balls. One says to the other i sure wish i could do that. The other stoner says you better get to know him better first.  Q. How do fish party ? A. Seaweed.  Q. Hear about the stoner who put his condom on backwards ? A. He went.   Q. What do you call one bowl between three tokers ? A. Malnutrition.  Q. What do you call a person who remembers what they did at woodstock ? A. A Liar.  Q. How do you know when you have smoked enough pot ? A. When you start looking around for the directions on how to use the lighter.  Stoner good fortune: When you are cleaning your room and find some hooch you forgot about.  Stoner Pick-up Line: Hey i have a 9 inch joint.  You might be a stoner if your bong gets washed more than your dishes.  There is a thin line between love and hate. Its starts about halfway through the joint.  Reality is an illusion caused by the lack of good pot.  Q. What is the difference between a drunk and a stoner ? A. The drunk will drive through a stop sign while the stoner will wait for it to turn green.  Q. Why did the pot head plant cheerios ? A: He thought they were donut seeds.  Two stoners were walking and saw a fly on a pile of crap. One stoner says to the other- Wow he had to go bad.  The stoner went to a bar. He has'nt had any nookie in awhile. He saw this chick leaning on the cigarette machine in a dark corner and decided to talk to her. Hey baby i know this is a little forward but i dont get out much so im willing to take a chance. Why dont me and you go to your place and get stoned, maybe cuddle and make a little whoopie. She looked up at the stoner and said - I cant right now, im on my menstrual cycle. The stoner scratched his head and thought for a second - it's ok I'll follow you, I'm on my honda.

       kakagaling ko sa lang sa baba, nagyosi. may nakita akong isang babaeng naka slacks na grey at hapit na hapit. napatingin ako sa kepay nya. di naman sa tibam ako no. yun lang yung una kong nakita at napansin ko na flat na flat ito. napaisip ako at biglang nainggit. nainggit ako dahil hindi bakat ang kepay nya. kasi ako, matambok ang kepay ko. nakakairita. ewan ko kung yung iba gusto nila yun pero ako hindi. nakakahassle. hindi ako makapag fit na pantalon dahil matambok nga ito. di rin ako makapgskirt dahil bumabakat ito (pero di din naman talaga ako nagiiskirt). CAMEL TOE ba kumbaga sa slang term. naalala ko tuloy ng highschool pa ko. nakashorts ako na mejo masikip. sabi ng kaibigan ko sakin: "O MERON KA NA NAMAN? DI BA KAKATAPOS MO LANG??" napamura ko men! "TANGINA! WALANG NAPKIN YAN! PUKE KO YAN!" hassle di ba? hay. siguro sa sex masarap sa lalaki kung malaman ang kepay pero para sakin, ayoko. minsan para kong lalaki na nakakita ng sexing babe at bigla tumayo si junior. hassle. o, sa mga makakabasa nito, wag nyo naman titigan yung kepay ko. kung gustuhin nyo mang tingnan para lang mapatunayan ang sinasabi ko, hinay hinay lang. wag masyado halata kasi baka mapahiya ako. taena, nahassle tuloy ako. kasalanan to ng yosi e. tama nga ung ad: SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.

        nagtatalo kami ni borgy kung alin ang mas tama. sabi nya: BIRDS OF DA SAME FEATHER ARE SIAMESE TWINS. kasi daw they share the same feather. ang sabi ko naman: BIRDS OF DA SAME FEATHER ARE GENEROUS. kasi nga they know the value of sharing. so ano kaya ang tama?

        "i think i understand now what love does. more than just weather the thick walls of the fortress you've built for years, it bores a hole into your otherwise solid self. it creeps itself into that hole, it makes a host out of your existence. it more than just completes you, it doubles you. it makes you feel that you are twice as big as you were before it came. but afterwards, when it leaves you, you are left with the hole, the void. a void that try hard as you may, you cannot fill. that void that renders you incomplete. suddenly you realize you are doing stupid things like asking people out on a date for the sole reason that you think they are "interesting" enough. then you get rejected by the "interesting" person. but just the same, you go on scratching the itch, trying to find another candidate to fill the void. not realizing that all your scratching just makes the scar bigger than it was before. ah, this void! it is more than love's itchy scar you want to hide or scratch. it is you taking a bite of that forbidden fruit. it is damnation. to the fires of eternal longing."  - Tsok -       inisip ko at naramdaman ko, sinulat mo lang tsok. salamat. u know i have a poor vocabulary.   but i never asked anybody out on a date though. haha! alam ko. mangongorek ka pa e. but you know what, you hit it right on the mark. sapol. tapos ka!

       Now I understand why men say women freak them out and why drama makes a woman "psycho". I now know because I have become a man incarnate. sad but true. I have become the demon I abhor brushing shoulders with again. I break heartS. WAHAAAAAAH! anlupet! NOT. only one heart. only one that can overpower a multitude. a heart that knows and makes use of its purpose. I am evil. pure at that.

       finally Rowena and Sammy got laid! woohoo! and dang, wuz it hella good! im talking bout the couple in this online novel im reading. i wuz juz tellin my friend ria about it over dinner last wednesday. i really had a great time with her -- dinner at Italiani's and clubbin at absinth. it wuz wholesome and naughty at the same time. (huh?) it wuz the first time we did it. over dinner...we had a semi different kind of conversation. we talked about books, men, movies, people we know and dont know personally, life...and at absinnth..we let our hair down and hit the dance floor! yeah, shake that booteey!! we watched and dissed people...flirted...haha! i had a good time! fuck wait! i wasnt supposed to talk about my date with ria! anyway...goin back to Rowena...the book is so totally not a must read, but ironically i am indulging it. I could juz read through the author and I find it amusing how she has let the story progressed. It juz seems so real yet surreal. ya get me? if not then fuck you! in this chapter I juz finished reading the lovers finally got it on! yeah!! now im thinking...will this get any exciting or will it get totally boring (not that it's really exciting or even mind boggling) since the fun part juz happened? well...lemme finish reading. :)

       There's a bar in NoBu called the Rock Bottom Brewery. I've always liked the name because it captures the essence of a moment in time when the road ahead is no where to be seen. For me that time is now.  A few weeks ago if you had asked me if I'd be writing this I would have thought you crazy. But unfortunately my romantic hapiness maybe coming to an end. Truthfully I'm not sure if its but the one question that pop's into my mind is: What happened? Was it something I said or did? Maybe its something I am not. I've anaylized every bit of it and I keep coming back to these questions.  She told me she wouldn't be able to give me what I needed. Did I give her some sort of sign that was the case? I don't believe so and quite contrary one thing central to me was to let her know how much she meant to me. I looked past the ugly rumors and misconceptions about who she was because she showed me her inner beauty. Was it because I'm hardly anyone's physical ideal? I make no bones about the fact I'm not all GQ and shit but I think I'm at least not bad to look at.  And what's up with that anyway ladies? Where did this idea that someone who looks like this is some sort of ideal for a mate. Lemme help y'all out on this and give you a bit of knowledge that you won't find in Cosmo, cause let me tell you they don't know shit about men. Thugs do not care about how you feel. The one's who aren't gay, which there are a lot more than anyone realizes, just use women for sex until they eventually end back in jail and get the anal sex they've been craving. Harsh I know, but its the truth. Obviously this isn't true for all of them, and for the ones thats the case all they really do is just use women for their own means. I'm not sure where this idea of "thug love" came from anyway. Every single couple I've known like this, every single last one, ends up with the woman carrying a couple of babies on her hip and huge amounts of debt on her back while she lives in the projects for the rest of her life. Meanwhile said thug is rotting away in jail or six feet under from being shot in the street. All that for a six pack stomach and some silly fucking clothes. And don't even get started on the fake ones always on TV, which is all of them, talking about life in the streets while they sip $500 wine and live in Manhattan penthouses. Street life isn't glamours and somebody would have to be insane to think living in the projects is a good thing, all that shit is just for selling records and music videos.  But I digress, I'm sure that isn't it. How could it be. She's told me how much my presence has meant to her. In truth I don't really know what it is. She hasn't/won't tell me. It's her right I know but I'm faced with the prospect of going threw the rest of my life wondering what it was about me or us that didn't allow her to see a bright future for us. Maybe its another man. I don't think she has found someone else since we had an agreement to tell each other if we did meet someone. What the question then becomes is if she is attracted to someone else and wants to free herself of me so that she could pursue them. If thats the case I want her to if it will make her happy and if he's a good man. That's just my jealous male ego talking though, she'd at least tell me.  All and all, I shouldn't be surprised I guess. One of the most memorable conversations I ever had with a impartial woman took place back in my senior year in high school. There was a group of girls I knew sitting behind me talking about the shit their boyfriends were putting them threw when I asked what they thought about me in a boyfriend capacity. One girl spoke up and said "Tsali," not my real name then, "you are not boyfriend material but definately I could see marrying someone like you...". Thats stuck with me ever since and has been the hallmark for all my relationships. I'm the extra safe backup plan, once they've had their wild time I'm the guy to settle down with. Not a bad thing I guess but for once I'd like to be the guy getting to enjoy the wild time.  But now I'm in a different mode of thinking. Before I was able to just let them go and not even worry about it, and that includes the girl I dated a few years back who got married two weeks after we stopped going out (lets just say that was a surprise to me along with her being pregnant with his baby). But this time is different. I finally figured out what love was with her.  I'm confused by the whole situation, mostly because it takes me out of my comfort zone of knowing at least the next step. For now I'll just stay in my own personal "Rock Bottom" with my pint of bitter and a Camel hanging from my mouth.  "Peut-être un jour tu reviendras, Je sais que mon coeur t'attendras" indeed.....     im sorry. im a jerk.

      I learned something new today. for the pro's, pardon my ignorane. Much thanks to Tsok for introducing this "stuff" to me. Please do not get the notion that we have already tried it. Duh, I wish.     SALVIA DIVINORUM BASICS        Salvia divinorum  is a species of sage (the genus Salvia). There are approximately 1000 species of Salvia worldwide, but Salvia divinorum is the only vision-inducing species known. Salvia is a member of a very large family of plants known as the Labiatae. Because mint is a well-known member of this family, it is sometimes referred to as the mint family. Salvia divinorum makes a beautiful house plant, and it can be grown just for that reason, but most people who grow this plant are interested in its fascinating psychoactive effects. The botanical name Salvia divinorum means "Sage of the Diviners." Under the right conditions, taken in the right way, Salvia produces a unique state of "divine inebriation." For hundreds of years, it has been used in religious and healing ceremonies by the Mazatec Indians, who live in the province of Oaxaca, in Mexico.  The effects of Salvia are very different from those of alcohol; but like alcohol, it impairs coordination.     Never, ever, attempt to drive under the influence of salvia--doing so could prove fatal!      Salvia contains a chemical substance called salvinorin A. Salvinorin A is responsible for Salvia's mind-altering effects. It is not chemically related to any other psychoactive drug. Unlike most visionary compounds, it is not an alkaloid. Pure salvinorin A is extremely potent. Doses of only several hundred micrograms (millionths of a gram) will have an effect, and doses above 1 milligram (1/1000 of a gram) are too much for most people to handle comfortably. Because of its extreme potency, pure salvinorin A should never be used unless the dosage has been precisely measured with an extremely accurate chemist's scale. Fortunately, Salvia leaf is hundreds of times weaker than pure salvinorin A; therefore, Salvia leaf can be used much more safely.  Salvia leaf is physically quite safe. It is very gentle on the body. Toxicological studies have shown that salvinorin A is extraordinarily non-toxic. No one has ever died from a Salvia overdose. Salvia is not habit-forming or addictive. People who choose to use Salvia, tend to do so quite infrequently. Salvia is not a stimulant, it is not a sedative, it is not a narcotic, it is not a tranquilizer. Like many entheogens, at sufficiently high doses it can induce visions, yet it is quite different from other entheogens. Dale Pendell, in his book Pharmako/poeia, assigns Salvia divinorum to a unique pharmacological class, which he calls "existentia." This term alludes to the philosophical illumination Salvia seems to shine on the nature of existence itself.     *click title for more info!*

        something that made me cry...     A long walk  Light blogging today, mostly because i believe that one's birthday should be like Shabbat. But i also take it to reflect upon my life. Today it hit me more than ever I want her in my life. I've felt this for sometime now but I really really wanted it today. I have it in a manner of speaking for which I'm mad gratefull for but my personal moment zen came today in the form of after 25 years, what will be legacy. A little dramatic I know but T.V. raised us to believe that one day we'd all be movie stars or rock gods, but we won't. And seeing as I don't have any platinum records or oscars sitting on my mantlepiece what is it I need to feel good when the hereafter comes for me. As a musician the easiest way to express my feelings is in song. I told her my song for her was Coltrane but after thinking about it for a bit I also think Jill Scott's "A long walk" says it best. Here's a snippet:    You're here, I'm pleased I really dig your company Your style, your smile, your peace mentality  Lord, have mercy on me I was blind, now I can see What a king's supposed to be Baby I feel free, come on and go with me   Let's take a long walk around the park after dark Find a spot for us to spark Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation  Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations   Your background it ain't squeaky clean shit  Sometimes we all got to swim upstream  You ain't no saint, we all are sinners  But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner I respect that, man you're so phat And you're all that, plus supreme Then you're humble man I'm numb  Yo with feeling, I can feel everything that you bring   Or maybe we can see a movie Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday (Saturday)  Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony  Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots or maybe eat some passion fruit Or maybe cry to the blues Or maybe we could just be silent   So babe, lets take a long walk....        This is the best thing ever said about me. so tell me now, shall i be touched or frightened?

      i woke up this morning with a smile on my face. i dreamt about him. he came back to visit and surprisingly he didnt hate me no more. i knew why. he wanted sex. i felt good. not because i wanted to fuck him. because he wants me again. though it wuz juz about the lust of the flesh i didnt care. it didnt matter. ive been dreaming of the day when things will be better between us. nuthin happened in my dream. it moved on to another story. i opened my eyes feeling good thinking bout seeing him again and spending time with him. a minute after, when i wuz fully awake, reality hit me with a blow. it wuz all a dream. i hate it. i hate it that it's juz a dream but i hate it most because reality or not i remain to be foolish and stupid when it comes to him....  "Mr. Sandman bring me a dream...."

      i dont know what my real intentions are. i have been contemplating. i feel like this is it. im not sure. but i want this to be IT. sometimes i feel like my actions defy what i truly feel inside. i tell you things that make me question my sincerity. i am full of what ifs. what if i hurt you? what if you hurt me? what if i am juz stirred by the passion of the moment? what if i am making you the outlet of my emotions for the object of my real affection? who is the real object of my affection? is it already you or am i still dwelling in my past? what if you're not being real? what if i am not being real? i wish to find the answers. i have been digging deeper. i dont want to be hurt again and definitely i dont want to hurt no one. one things for sure though, with every moment i will say to myself: do not to fuck it up this time! for now, i will juz relax, take it slow and wait for the day when i can finally say DIZZIZZIT!

      putangina talaga ang mga pinoy! chona, i think kaibigan mo sya!   To Marjie,  I am not surprise or wander why Dennis leave you. Why? What reason you can think about but you're very fat body. I'm thought before that Dennis only use me to his toy but sooner and later I'm realize that he really can't not beared or stomached to be with you anymore because at first, Dennis say he could not stand you're habit of making pakialam all his walks and always calling to their house what time he go home or this or that and then he say he get ashame to met you iether in school or in his family and then asking you to exercise you're very, very, very fat body but you hate it you thoughth you're the most prettiest girls he know about what do you think you are "Beautiful Girl" of Jose Mari Chan even you are beautiful face (to your think) you do not have the rigth to called me whatsoever or else different name one time or the other for the real purposed to insults my personality because I'm never call you names before iether in front of Dennis or in the backs of Dennis, ! but if you start already to calling me different name, I'm don't have any other choice but to called you other different name to like you are a PIG, FAT, OBESSED, OVERWIGHT AND UGLY SHAPE girl. Shame to you're body that is to a BUDING. You can't not blame Dennis for exchanging you to me because I'm am the more sexier than you when you look to us in the mirror. I'm repeat again that you are like Ike Lozada when she is a girl.  FROM: THE SEXIEST GIRL OF D.M.  Ps. You say that I'm the bad breathe But who is Dennis want to kissed. Me or you? You or me? And the final is me.

      actually, the title has no connection with my entry. I wuz singing that stupid song before i started typing.  anyway, i juz wanna share that i am extra emotional today. it's weird. Borgy and i couldnt decide on what movie to watch. we were choosing between I, Robot and Catwoman. then we started talking about halle berry's interview with oprah (when she discussed eric benet's addiction to sex). suddenly, i felt a lump on my throat, then tears started falling. i wuz able to relate to her story. whoa, whoa! wait. im not a sex addict, aight. i juz can relate with how halle berry felt and the questions she had in her head when she found out that her husband wuz fucking around. (it's quite the same how i wept when kris aquino cried on national tv and asked "ano pa ba ang kulang sakin?" haha! feeling showbiz!) in fairness, my ex didnt cheat on me (not that i know of!) he said he "  LOST IT  " and there wuz no one else...whatever that means. but there were so many girls right after we broke up (me included. yeah i know im foolish.) so i wuz wondering, what could i be lacking? im sure it's not the nookie cuz he got em quite deliciously and generously (cmon, we're all mature people here.) plus i loved him ever so dearly than my life so what more could he ask for right? ok, ok i know those are not the only factors that need to be considered. but aside from my being bratty, spoiled, dramatic and sometimes bitchy and catty, where did i go wrong to deserve the shit i went through? oh good Lord above, i dont wanna leave this earthly abode without getting the answers. Anj would always remind me that some questions have no answers and better unanswered. why? im not the type of person who would be be fine left hanging. i need answers and i need them now. it's not impatience (or maybe it is). im juz tired of thinking too much and filling my head with supposition and assumption. it's really torture. i know, everybody's sick of hearing me speak about the same bugaboo. they ask me why i still give a rats ass about him. i really dont know. so God please, please hear the cry of my heart or help me dust myself off and move on to the next chapter of my life....

      I emailed him back already. I agreed with his decision. I know that I am not 100% sure that i want to be with him forever. a lot of stuff still matters and they become a hindrance to his so called  a good life together . if i know that in the end, there wont be an  us , why stay in this affair, right? we can be great friends and just save the effort, energy and love for the right one. (But then again, WHO is the right one?)  i dont know if im being idealistic and unrealistic, waiting for that   mad passionate love   feeling or if it is the normal thing to do and look for when in search for a partner. will i still be able to find that in this lifetime? does it still exist? and what kind of partner am i talking about? a lifetime partner or just a lover kind of partner? i dont know. as always, i am confusing myself. but i am sure of one thing though, i have already found that person with whom i have felt mad-psycho-obsessed-passionate love, but unfortunately it wuz unrequited. i know that he is the  love of my life  and i dont think i can ever feel that for someone else again. yeah, i know it's sick but that's my sorry story.  At my age, i thought i have gone beyond the  kilig  aspect when looking for a partner. By  kilig  i mean that tingling sensation in your body when u think of his  delicious physique, the butterflies in your tummy when you remember his sweet smelling aroma and the way your face beams when you picture him in his bling bling get up and car. Of course those are not the major criteria of my pursuit of Mr. Right (if he really fucken exists). However, in as much as i hate to admit it, i still find myself putting much consideration in the aesthetic faculites. I guess this goes for all of us, unless one doesnt really have that sense of what is beautiful and  pleasant to the eyes. (whoa!) i dont mean to sound like im one hot, sexy mami, cuz i aint (tsss! false humiliation! haha! jk!) it's just that, i am more inclined to getting attracted to people who are beautiful not just inside (eeew! ms. universe!) but also outside. (DUH!)  putang ina! nakainom na ko't lahat di ko na to natuloy. tinatamad na ko. i wuz rambling anyway so fuck it right? i dont even know where i wuz drivin at. goodbye.

      While dressin up for work, i heard Kris Aquino say on tv " Dapat talaga inlove ka para malampasan nyo kahit ano. My mom taught me that. You should go for the one you love and not the one who loves you. Hindi porque love ka, yun na yun!.. ." After hearing that, i wuz like,  DAYUUM! YOU HIT IT RIGHT ON THE SPOT!  that's exactly how I felt until i opened my email today.  Juz to backtrack, Tuesday last week I went to see my OB for a check-up. I wuz already perplexed even before i went and the wait time for the result made me even more tensed. I went home feeling all stressed out from thinkin and from walking in the mall for 5 hrs straight, non stop. He has been texting since monday night to comfort me. But on Tuesday night, he rambled about me getting cold and distant and that something else is up and he even went to the point of askin me what i want to happen. ugh! that freaked me out! we already had that kind of discussion before and harsh things were said and revealed. We also promised each other that we will never talk about it again and we'll juz take things slow and follow natures course. he didnt keep that promise. he sounded psycho when he texted me that night and gave me drama and that fucken scared me. i drew the line from there. i felt suffocated that i had to ask for space. i stopped replyin to his emails and text messages. i told him that we need  to take some time off from each other. I was missin him, but a part of me was relieved. Now, I am " offically " single!  On the way to the office this morning, i was contemplating on the statement i heard on tv and i wuz also battling with myself if it's ok now to get in touch with him. i never came to a decision.  After setting up the tools on my PC and after checking my work email and 2 other personal mailboxes, i opened the mailbox that i use to chat with him. I wuz kinda hoping he sent me something. I wuz surprised he did and wuz shocked after reading it.  He's letting go of me . I felt sad. No. I felt terrible. The selfish side of me wanted to email him back and tell him i cant and dont want to. He has given me " perfect " love. Any girl or any person would want and would need the kind of love he can offer. He makes me feel not juz beautiful and important but he makes me feel perfect and complete. I can never return that favor. the question WHY? would always surface when this topic arises. I dont know is always my answer. Definitely that is a lie. I have my reasons and shallow and harsh as they may be, they count as majorly important. Important because i would never want to hurt him any deeper as much as i am already hurting him. Or maybe I am scared of hurting myself in the end. I have been through a lot of shit and that made me, reluctantly i'll admit, an asshole. It could be a justification, maybe by nature i am really an asshole, I wouldnt really know. There are a lot of things that i am totally confused about. I was telling my friend earlier that I have reached this age and up until now, I still cant stand on my own to make a wise judgement and decision. After the major storm i had in my life, i thought i was going to be  stronger, tougher, wiser, more objective and i would stay away from drama. I wuz wrong. I am one big drama. It's as if I am a drama magnet. I still easily cry, from the silliest cheezy movie to books to stories of other people to my own relationships whether with a man or friends or family. My emotions still overpower me. I have tried so hard to deviate from this kind of disposition, but i always fail.  Now, I am faced again with a major dilemma and i dont know what to do. Maybe i know but I am scared that I will be wrong with the decision i will come up with. I guess this time i'll say,   bahala na si Lord  . But then again He gave us the free will and wisdom and judgement higher than all His other creatures. (I guess im better off as a monkey. whaddaya think?) fuck it. I am so confused. My selfish nature is creeping in. i need help.

      I saw Me and Morrison last night with Francis, Ria and Hazel. It took me several hours to realize that i liked the film. hehe! If it wuz a novel, i judge it as a bestseller! But fo sho Milla, Aki and the dope got my attention. 100% baby! I kinda felt sad though that i had a glimpse of my life a couple of months back. sex, drugs and rock & roll. ok, not rock & roll, but hip hop and reggae. (DUH!) oh what a fucked up life! im just glad now things are starting to change for me. Though self imposed, i really commend myself for having the courage to change my mindset and perspective. Im not getting any younger and having a  happy go lucky life wont bring me  success and a happy ending. Im vying for, just like People Support, a Drug-free Environent and then some as much as possible. Im still not halfway through my journey. I just took my first step. After so much tears, pain, humiliation and harsh realization only  did I have the backbone to start over. (YEESS!) Taking another step forward is very hard. I dunno until when I can maintain this reflective disposition. I wanna be a changed person but i admit I am very weak and I easily fall into temptation, so help me God. For now, I just take things slow in taking the garbage out of my system and I dont stop hoping and sometimes praying that God will see me through. It's not goinna be easy and fast but I know eventually He will smile at me from above.

      I had a good buzz last friday. After havin a 3 week hiatus, I kinda missed it so I decided to go  clubbin  (damn, that word is juz overrated!). I had a date wit Anj and it wuz really fun. I practically had 5 glasses of  weng-weng  and popped a V. wow! i felt so good! ok, i am not a rookie when it comes to Vs but if you have a long break from it, it's juz too damn exhilarating! (smiley, smiley! hehe!)  Every dreaded day at work, to survive the 9 hour helluva shift, I make it a point to visit Pax Acidus for a lil amusement. My favorite persona in that site is McCutcheon. Today, I read a new post in his NYC scribbles and, as always, i am amused and sorta affected with his humanity. Judging from his posts and writings, I believe him to be a man overflowing with talent and intellect and humor, freaky, pervert and oddly, a good natured man. His post today, though kinda hilarious, manifested pure sadness. He is a talented muthafuckin drunk and alone. I didnt say that. He did. And that is a fact. OUCH. (ok, this post isnt really about him, juz a digression.)This brought me down to the bumpy memory lane. I had a vision of how my life wuz several months back. I wuz strikingly gorgeous and rousingly sexeeeh and phenomenally talented, stoned, drunk and sad. (jeez! alright, alright. leave it at stoned, drunk and sad.) I thought everythin wuz goinna be ok if i keep myself from being sober. I wuz wrong. The high kept me alive (for a couple of years) but not really sane for too long. I juz recently realized that. Dont get me wrong. I dont regret passing that stage in my life. I dont think i will ever regret it (Im tryinna keep a "  no regrets  " mindset. wish me luck!). Seriously though, i think, im kinda missing it. That steady feeling when you dont give a rats ass of how you look or how others feel and all you're juz savoring is the floating sensation inside you. When you feel so lightheaded and the word humiliation is no long a part of your vocabulary, you juz know that you're entitled to whatever bullshit or crap you wanna say or do. When the world seems so small and you feel like you're as powerful and as mighty as godzilla and you're lord of all. damn! yeah, that feeling! (i feel so good now. imma skip the details of the morning after.)  I wanna indulge it again but im scared. I have a tendency to over do it and i dont want that to happen. again. looking back, i realized how unhappy and how full of guilt i wuz cuz i know that it is a violation of the rules set by the Big Guy up there. (ya heard me right. im a Christian and Im not ashamed! you might be saying,  this biatch has the audacity to talk about Christianity when she wuz juz discussing drugs and maryjane ! sorry. =( ) I think im doing better this way. Im not saying im living a  happy, happy, joy, joy  life. It's juz not as stressful and im not as  praning  as i wuz before though im really kinda crazy and it's way beyond me. (hehe!) But im not also saying Im totally stopping from taking any stuff (If i can, why not? But this shit is really hard!). Maybe have a lil of this and that occasionally. Ya know, juz for the sake of a havin a good time but not totally dependent on it. Yeah, maybe that's what ill be doing. Juz like last friday. It wuz a blast! =)

         Wow! Ang galing! I love it! One of the best films I ever watched. Great screenplay!   I never thought i'd bawl my eyes out like that again after Kramer vs Kramer and Titanic. (haha! i know! u must be saying " Titanic?? WTF ") The film was presented with much truth. It's wasnt made to look deep and intelligent but doesnt really make much sense. It wuz presented with a very creative concept but the script flowed lightly but definitely not empty. Casual lines will make you nod your head and say " yeah...that's right " It has a great mix of comedy, drama and romance. Kirsten Dunst's character is hella funny! as Borgy would say it, Best Actress in a   sabog   role! haha!  I really love the film cuz i can relate to it. I saw myself in most of the characters. Mary -- stoner, gullible, bitchy, zealous, attached... Clementine -- wierd but will never admit it, defensive, free spirited, easily bored, party animal, affectionate, enthusiastic, nagger, crazy, impulsive, emotional...Joel -- hopeless romantic, dweller, insecure, funny, sentimental...  There are so many lines in the film that struck me, touched me and some hit me like a bolt of lightning. The cheesy tagline " You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story ." is my story. He told me that I am one file he deleted in his memory. Yeah, it sounds corny but when someone you love tells it to your face, it kills you. There's also a part in the film that made me choke -- when they were struggling to cheat the procedure and Clem suggested that Joel brings her to a place where she doesnt belong, and he juz said " I cant rememeber anything without you " (or summin like that). I live my life like that. I am juz totally in bondage. You must be saying,  how sad . Yeah, it is. Pathetic. The last part also holds true when they were listening to the recordings of their memory of each other, it wuz juz full of hate. Hate for each other. All negative. Why do people do that? Focus on the bad side and realize everything good and sweet when it's all gone. I wuz like that. I never really appreciated him when we were together and really regreted everything i said and all actions i did when he left me. Im juz wondering now, does he feel the same or is he saying " good riddance "? We had an exchange of hurtful words but i wuz showered abundantly. I wish to be given another chance...to make everything right or atleast try. I am juz so jealous with the scene at the cookout when they were going back to where they first met:   Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon.  Joel: I know.  Clementine: What do we do?  Joel: Enjoy it.    How I wish we had that moment. We drifted apart and ended it but we were given another opportunity to be together. The sad thing was we used it in vain. I know he still wanted me and i needed him but we were full of pride. It became all kinda superficial and shallow. Had we taken care of that opportunity, it couldve been another chapter with a happy ending. or I guess im juz foolish and stupid to even think that a real  second chance  is possible.  It has been years and I am devastated to find myself still attached to him. While watching the film, I kept on saying to myself, " how i wish Lacuna is real. How i wish the procedure is possible ". But as it neared the ending, it came to me what pain it will cause to lose even the sweetest and best of memories i had with him. I dont ever want that to happen. I didnt even wanna lose him to begin with. But they say, break the bondage before it breaks you. well, too late. it already did. I have always wished for amnesia to cure me from this madness, but I realized if every scene and every line in Eterenal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is all true and real then all effort will be in vain. But does it hold true for everyone? If it does then I am a hopeless case.  So how can one forget and move on? Now I am really confused.    "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!. The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!. Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."

         It has become a part of my daily ritual to check Mr. Jim Paredes' site, but it wuz only yesterday when i checked his photography page. All the pictures were taken with very good taste but the picture above really captured my eyes. a dead tree by the ocean and littered driftwood all over the place. fruitless, futile and withered but definitely beautiful. i wuz in awe. It made me realize that God looks at us the same way we do with that picture. No matter how sinful, careless, selfish and worthless we have become through the years, God still sees the beauty in us. This makes me love and wanna worship my God all the more.    The Heart Of Worship (When The Music Fades)  Verse 1 When the music fades All is stripped away And I simply come Longing just to bring Something that's of worth That will bless your heart  Bridge I'll bring You more than a song For a song in itself Is not what You have required You search much deeper within Through the way things appear You're looking into my heart  Chorus I'm coming back to the heart of worship And it's all about You It's all about You, Jesus I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it When it's all about You It's all about You, Jesus  Verse 2 King of endless worth No one could express How much you deserve Though I'm weak and poor All I have is yours Every single breath  Bridge I'll bring You more than a song For a song in itself Is not what You have required You search much deeper within Through the way things appear You're looking into my heart  Chorus I'm coming back to the heart of worship And it's all about You It's all about You, Jesus I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it When it's all about You It's all about You, Jesus
