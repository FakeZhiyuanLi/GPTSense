      Hey People.  I'm not really sure what to write today. It's been rather eventless so far. Thomas and I have been watching my dad's star trek dvd and now Thomas is watching dream catcher. Speaking of Dream Catchers, I have an enormous one in my room with a picture of a giant   E a g l e  . It's really cool.  At the moment I'm listening to Nirvana (heart-shaped box) and Getting ready to walk the dog. I'm not sure if he got walked yesterday so we better take him soon.  I really miss Fallon... I called her house today and asked her mom what time she was going to be home tomorrow. Her mom said 9:00 p.m. ! How am I gonna see her!? Thomas is here so I can't drag him to go see my girlfriend at 9:00 at night! And her mom also said she has a doctor's appointment the day after that so I probably won't be able to see her untillthe tuesday :'( ! This all makes me really sad... I don't know what to do... I bet she's also going to be mad at me because of this... Whatever. C ya...    Your Lord and Master,          Keitan

       I would like to use this blog to apologize to My friend Sara Smith. She has jsut complined that I have not even mentioned her name yet in these blogs. I'm too lazy to check it over so I'll just type this about her.  When I first met Sara She had redish brown hair and was about the same height or a little taller than me. I met her through My girlfriend Fallon because they are best friends. We became instan buddies and swapped e-mails and everything. SHe also became good friends with my best friend Kevin Smith (lol no relation).  Sara is a perky, happy person and intelligent when she wants to be. An excellent friend. Just don't get her mad, or else she might pour pop on your head right Sara? ;)    Your Lord and Master,              Ketian

       Ahh... What a great song. I have been playing in bloom all day on my guitar. I just busted a string playing the solo :$. Be proud of me fellow guitar players! lol ANyway, My last post was about guitar so onto another subject...  My cousin Thomas is coming over today to sleep over for I don't know how many nights. It's going to be fun because he's bringing his x-box and HALO! I love that game. I'll kick his ass in Soul Calibur on my Playstation 2 if he badly kicks my ass in Halo. Or maybe we'll beat the game together.  Fallon comes back on sunday!!! I miss her so much... It's not always true that you don't know what you have until it's gone, it's just a lot more noticable... Just remember that.  Anyway I'll be off now.    Your Lord and Master,            Keitan     P.S.  Please make some comments about my posts. What fun is it to have an internet diary if nobody says anything about it?

       I've been playing guitar for a while now and I think I'm finally getting the hang of it. I've been playing all morning actually (wouldn't Uncle Rob be proud!) and my fingers aren't even sore.  Ther reason I started playing in the first place this morning was because of a stupid car alarm. I had my window open (as I always do during the night) and it was 10:00. This stupid car's alarm went off 3 times in a row. This happened yesterday too so I was pretty mad. I grabbed my guitar and moved the amp to face towards the window. I turned it up all the way and let loose the loudest song I could play lol. It was fun, but nobody in the neighbourhood complained... :(  I got to talk to my goose today (Fallon). She called me from one of the neighbouring cottages. I was so happy to hear from her! It was great. We got at least 20 minutes on the phone so that was fine too. I won't bug you guys with the details it was all mushy anyway lol. Anyway, I'm off!    Your lord and Master,                              Keitan

      Well I tried to get a blog post in here earlier but my computer wasn't letting me sign into the website for some reason.  My favourite guitar tab site was malfuntioning as well.     I spent babysitting my sisters Tiffany and Maia. Nadia came over and kept me company so I didn't get too bored. We basicly sepent the whole day here on the computer. Now Tiffany has gone to her mom's house and Maia is next door so I am free here for a while. It's monday now and I still have to babysit Maia until thursday. You see, usually my grandparents are here to look after my sister while mom is at work, but at the moment my grandparents are in Collingwood because they have time share there... We usually go up with them but it's gotten boring. There's nothing for a teen-aged guy or girl to do because you're always alone uless you bring a friend (not that there's room for them anywhere in the house).     I'm severly missing Fallon right now... SHe's at Dreanna's cottage for a week as well so I'm lonely. She'll probably read these posts when she comes back so just for the record,   I LOVE YOU FALLON!!!     I can't wait 'til you come back.     I would really like to spend this week seeing some old friends and I'll see what I can do about that...     Anyway, I'll see if I can bring this long post to a close.  Adios              Your lord and Master,                                              Keitan

       Well hi... My girlfriend Fallon has been begging me to make a site like this for me for a million years. Okay, okay that's exaggerating a little lol. If you're reading this you probably already know me cause there's probably no other way you'd get this link. However if you don't know me, here's the scoop: I'm 15 and a 1/2 and I live in Mississauga Canada. My name's pronounced "K-10" soo none of this Kee-tan garbage okay? As I was saying, I'm 5'5 and have a tinge of brown colour in my skin due to my Dominican and Indian backgrounds. I listen to alternative rock mostly, for example Nickelback, Default, Puddle of mudd, 12 Stones, Nirvana... But I also like a little hard rock like Disturbed and Rage Agaisnt the Machine.     For you people who know me this is probably a little boring... I dunno what to say... Fallon's here with me right now. She's leaving me for a week to go to her best friend's cottage :( That sucks like you wouldn't believe. However I will use this week to the best of my ability to catch up with old friends and my cousins Thomas and Misha. If you want to get together then send me an e-mail.  Anyway, I better start to pay attention to Fallon before she gets bored. C ya soon as I can.         Your lord and Master ,                        Keitan Motiram.
