      You won't believe it, I just wasted 5 hours sitting here playing this PC gamed called Age of Empires.  It is high addictive and my need to win resulted in several attempts at it.  I think the computer got sick of playing it that it let me win.  Well, that was time well spent...  Anyhow, I am writing because I just thought of the execise I am supposed to do to help me get some sort of guidance.  So, if you are twenty something and also very lost as to where this existence is supposed to lead you, this may help.  I don't know, I thought I would try it now...  In five years from now, I see myself as having obtained a masters degree in Political Science, hopefully teaching three classes, probably very lower division.  Intro to American Politics, Intro to International Relations, and another course I hope to devise, combining Sociology with Political Science.  Oh, Racial Politics is also good.  I should have purchased a home, whether it be a house or condo.  No children yet, I'll be 29 in five years, so not til I am past 30...  I should have traveled in all continents by this point in time, besides the ice caps, so, that leaves South America and Africa.  (By the way, these goals have to be very specific) I think I would like to teach community college, and write books/short stories/etc. on the side.  I hope by then, I would have published about 10 pieces...    Well, my future plans ten years from now, it'll have to wait.  I need to quit useless time wasting, like dilly dallying on the computer.

      I thought that maybe I should begin to put my thoughts down for public view.  Isn't this what the accessibility of the world wide web is all about?  To publish views of the most mundane of people?  I think my reflections on life is fascinating, it is to me, so why not be on a huge ego trip and publish them?   So, here I go.  I began studying for the GRE's, the grad school entrance exam, and I realize, holy cow, I don't remember ANY math.  What were the rules of exponents?  I can't recall any of it, and I am lacking all motivation to relearn them again.  I believe I am considering to go back for more school because I am utterly lost as far as my future is concerned.  I decided earlier this year that I would give writing a try.  I always have writing, why not try to sell my pieces?  I quit my 9 to 5 to return to waiting tables as I had done in college and give writing a try, give soul searching a try.  So, I suppose beginning this rant page is very much a part of the self-discovery... who knows.  But I digress, I cannot remember any of the exponential rules, though I do recall all the algebra and geometry.  It's now June, and at the end of this month, it would have been exactly two years since I graduated.  Something to think about.  I have a B.A. in Political Science, with which I have done nothing, and now preparing to obtain a M.A. in Political Science.  Interesting.  ( I won't rant about the current political situation of the U.S. today.)  So now I must succumb to studying rudimentary mathematics so that I can write a dissertation of modern political follies.
