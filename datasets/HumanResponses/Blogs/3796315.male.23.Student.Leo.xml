      Yoz, it's Saturday. After such a longLong week, it's finally saturday! The lessons at night are really a tad too late. Met up with yun today, lots of thanks to her for the stuff she brought over.Really excited to see her again. She came all the way to my house after her driving lessons to send the stuff to me, mighty thanks to her. Went to the city for dinner and had a great tine chatting. Hmm, ha wanted to send her back home but she really insisted that I do not have to send her up to her doorsteps. I thought i could if i insisted, well i guess she and I are real stubborn. So in the, i had to give in. Got to say sorry to her if i delayed her time. Hey, by the way, next Tuesday will be my cooking day, i have invited her over to our place for dinner, not confirmed yet. The not so good thing is that my days are the longest on thursday, while she is free on Thursday, haah. Bo bian..   Anyway, had my first lab lessons on friday. I almost forgot all the java coding. Looks like I got real catching up stuff to do. Did some econs today. So how do i feel now? ok la. nothing much ya. Hope all the guys back in singapore are doing fine. Wish everything is a OK back home too. Alrighty,got to go.  Ja mata ne

      Yoz, it's Friday again. Yeah! Got loads of tut to complete, and lot of readin up to do. hd some problems with registration, i have dropped HR but it seems that the staff from IRU said that the max subject I can take is 4? If that's the case, i woul d have to drop DSP ( it's not that interesting). But that would means that I have to overload when I return.  Had warm homecooked food when I reached home late last evening. so great to have homecooked food ya. My housemates and I will take turns to cook. I would say all of us are great cooks. Not much recipes to share, we just add what we think will turn out nice and most of the time it did. Haah, Weixiang suggested that we start a recipe book of what we cook and pass it down to the next tenant. Yesterday chef was WX, fabulous food. Think I will be cooking next Tuesday. I would try to cook up some nice food, this time it will be a treat from me.( will pay for the grocery)  Supposed to meet up with yun, but kept getting a dead tone. Aiyo, like that how to contact her? Hope to see her at SSS gathering tonight. Hmm.. what is SSS? I also don't know. I only know there's a meet the international student from 6-9pm tonight at QUT. My lecture ends at 8pm, and i'm not sure if there is lab. See how it goes la, will contact WengChuan because he says he'll be going.  Alrighty, time to hit the books. Ciaoz.

      Big Brother has ended. I never really watch it, but it's like the whole australia is crazy about this reality show. The black guy won ( forgot his name), and my housemates were saying it is expected.   Serene passed her driving test. yah!!! Congrats from&nbsp;fellow housemates of&nbsp;of 2/50 Durham Street.&nbsp; So far so good for me, decided to drop one of the modules. So i will be takng only 5 modules here (1 more than normal load), rather than 6.   Tutorials are rolling in and so will be getting busier. Cooked chicken rice, didn't turn out as expected but still nice. Today chefs are Michelle and me. I think i will be cooking for Mondays or Tuesday because i am more free on those days.   Anyway, i have uploaded some photos, go&nbsp; urlLink Holiday At Brisbane Will be uploading more in the future.   Ok, going to have dinner now, wish that all is well back home.

      &nbsp;Wow, 2 weeks&nbsp; flew by fast.&nbsp; School started and my timetable is cramped. Lessons only on&nbsp;wed, thursday and friday. But my class ends at 8-9pm... It's cold at night ya.&nbsp; Attended my first lecture at QUT and I think the studying style here is quite different from Singapore.&nbsp;   Anyway, txtbook here is real expensive. Saw a "Digital communication" which&nbsp;I used last semester for SC205. That txtbook cost AUD$98 here!&nbsp;   So, I am looking around for 2nd hand txtbook. Supposed to meet up with one student to buy a 2nd hand txtbook but he didn't meet up. So far so good, Michelle's (my housemate) friends are here for a week of holidays. They are leaving tom because school starts next week for them in Sydney n Melbourne.   Yun arriving on Sunday and&nbsp;she is bringing over some of my stuff to brisbane. Really thankful to her. ( are you readin this, haha)&nbsp;Hmm, should I go fetch her on Sunday?   Internet connection&nbsp;at home&nbsp;still not up yet. I got loads of photos, finding time to upload into server so it will be available ya.   Been doing some cooking at home, making black beans n peanuts soup today. Now i realised&nbsp;the effort needed to do the cooking and the washing up. But i still enjoy cooking. Hmm, think will cook redang chicken one of these days.   Alrighty, got to go. Meeting another student to buy txtbook. Hopefully this guy turned up ya. See you later

      Woah, arrived at Brisbane on the 3rd of july, my friend Issac picked me up and I met my housemates for the first time. They are very nice people. Serene and Michelle. The whole house is more lively with the 2 girls around. I had home cooled dinner for the past few nights, yumyum.  Couldn't access the net till now, using my neightbour's computer. It's my 1st week here and i am enjoying myself. Watched the Euro 04 at a pub and qhat a surprise, the Greeks won!!  Another 2 friends(jeremy and angchor) joined me on the 5th for a 2 weeks holidays. We went to Byron bay to catch the sunrise, it was freezing. But the scenery was nice, saw lots of dolphins and whales at the coast at it is the migrating season.  Played basketball with Issac, jeremy, Kai Mun, ang chor,Serene and Michelle 2 days ago. It was great fun as the weather was very cooling. Well, not sure where we are going tomorrow as the itinary is not fixed ya.  will write soon. see ya

      Yo, haven't been posting for quite some time. Hmm, time flew like speed of light,gone in a flash. This is already week 5 of the school term.. There is an AI assignment due next week, I am going to spend a lot of time on that.  Well, saw some of the photos that my fellow coursemate, Derrick posted online. He went to France for exchange program. The scenery there is so beautiful. Contacted Saekiat. He went to Lulea, Sweden. Stuff over in Sweden cost a lot ya.  Anyway, attended 1st Latin dance class at UQ today. Had fun learning the dance steps. Did some practice with Serene and Michelle, and they are better than I. Have to practice more often in front of the mirror, ha. Dominic is asking if i want to learn golf. Am interested but I got assignments coming up. Hmm, still thinking, may be going since it's once per week.   Serene's going back to Singapore at the end of the month. She has decided not to apply for PR. Will be having a farewell dinner for her soon.  Made soy milk today, was supposed to put in a bit of ginger to remove the beany taste. But i had put in too much and the milk taste gingery. Haha. Don't think will make any more because it's quite troublesome.  ALrighy, getting late soon, got to go. Wish all is well at back home. Ciaoz/

      Hello! Happy 39th NAtional day Singapore!! Whew, i said I was supposed to update my journal, didn't I? well, journal still untouched, I found that if i keep on delaying, the memorable part of my life would be forgotten.   Ok, i shall began with last Friday.. I missed the ferry and so decided to take the bus to the city, another bus came along and I thought might as well board the bus and alight at the 'interchange' to transfer to the city as it will be faster. And I met Yun on the bus, what a coincidence. Haa, never expect to met her on the bus.. Anyway, I was still late for school.. reached at around 430pm. Class ends at 9pm. Again, I was learning new stuff during the practical session. Practical ended a bit later then usual. So I walked to the city central, wanting to buy a 10-trip savers. I also exchanged the free Mars bar which I won at the convenience store.. I was about to go to the bus stn and I bumped into Yun and her friend. Haha, what a super coincidence. In the end we went for a drink at Southbank ya. Her friend stayed 1 street from where I am staying.   Stayed at home over the weekend. Serene and Michelle went to Gold Coast for the Single Adults Resort getaway.  Ok, I am going to take up latin dancing class, saw the people dancing at the cafe on Friday and got interested. Ha, am thinking of taking up beginners golf too. There's a wakeboarding/waterskiing session on Saturday. Will be joining that with WengChuan and Shubhendro( fellow NTu students studying at QUT)  Went to QUT with Dominic for the National DAy celebration organised by the SSA. Quite interesting.. Bought curry rice for lunch. Anyway, stayed in school to do some homework before heading back home.  Cooked curry chicken at home with the ready made paste. Had rice and prata for dinner.. haha so fatty.. After which we went to watch National day prarade at Andrew's place. End up singin National Day songs instead because the live streaming is slow.  Ok, Ekka(australian fun fair day) day on Wed == no school!  Want to go there but WX not going neither is Serene. Michelle going on Friday which I can't really go because I have class. Asked Wengchuan and he told me he went there on Sat with his housemate. Asked yun and she is busy this week with her research. Wah liew.. sian. Looks like I got to give this a miss, stupid and no fun going alone..  Ok, i got to go. Have to update my journal. Hope everything fine back home.  Ciaoz.

      It's near the end of the week and it's so fast.. Into the 3rd week now.. Work is piling up.. Practical and assignments are on and going.. Getting frustrated... can't seem to concentrate on the practical.. esp the programming. Was supposed to be late for the 1100 econs tutorial today, but when I reached there, there was a fire alarm, and so classes delayed till 1120. whew..  The OS lectures and practicals are so turgid..Thursday is a long day for me, all the way from 1100 to 2100. And by the time i reached home, it's around 10pm ++.    Got to buck up, luckily i have nice housemates whom i can get along and relate with.. Hmm, thinking of where to go this weekend... looks like i may have to stay at home to study ya. Alrighty, got to go.. really tired now. i think i have to update my journal more often.. see you!

      Yoz..it's over, the party is over. Not exactly a party; just a dinner. Haah, tonite was full of " surprises ". As mentioned earlier, our neighbour came over for dinner (Dominic, Jinghui and Geraldine). The dinner started at 930pm... Man that was late ya. Final menu for the night: Malay style grilled chicken, stewed beef, fried cabbage, baked nuggets, fish fingers, 9-layer kueh and curry.    I didn't eat much because I had quite a mouthful when I did the cooking. I have to finish a bowl of  Mee sua  and a red egg, which is super filling. Took quite a number of photos on Michelle digital cam, but I think the card is corrupted or what, the photos weren't there anymore when I tried to uploda into the computer.  Those photos that are nice are in the SD card. Will try to upload again tom, hopefully everything is still there.    I thought there isn't any cake because WX says the 9-layer kueh is the birthday cake. But in the end, towards the end of the dinner, our neighbour brought the cake in. Jinghui bought the blackforest cake from St Micheal. Lots of thanks ya, Jinghui and neighbours.    I got a good luck bear as bday present. Woah, that's my favourite carebear? haha, i think must be Michelle idea as i had told her before. Thanks guys for the effort you all made the difference by going that extra mile. Talking about " extra mile "... thanks to WX and Michelle for the call. Though not a success, I do appreciate the things you guys have done. And to Dominic, sorry hor.    Alright, a new chapter of my life has began. Once again, thanks to the people of unit 1 and 2 of 50 Durham street; including WX, Serene, Michelle, Geraldine, Dominic and Jinghui.    Ok gtg, tomorrow is a brand new day. The birthday boy

      Am cooking dinner now, have been preparing since 4pm in the evening. It's 8:30pm now and dinner not exactly ready yet. I had cook beef stew and malay style grilled chicken. The chicken didn't turn out that good,because I left it for too long;.. the drumsticks are too huge! Well, but it's still edible ya, haha. COmmited the same mistake by cooking it too long. Beef stew still ok. Michelle is cooking  Mee Sua  with red egg for birthday boy which is me, haha. It's a long time since I had that,traditional birthday. WX came home early from his lecture to help out. He asked: " Where is lead actress of the night ". Haha, no   lead actress  tonight ya.   Tasted the 9-layer cake that Michelle made. It exceeded my expectation, tasted like the real Mccoy though the layers weren't very nicely done. Anyway, waiting for Dominic (our neighbour) to come home from school (QUT-the real University) before we start the dinner. Also hope that Serene will be in time for dinner too ya.   Ok, have to go and help out in the kitchen.  Ciaoz.. The Birthday BoY

That's so fast.. unlike some of   us  ..haha, know who I mean..  Last night we had baked mushroom and chicken  filo  made by michelle. And after that, WX made chicken curry for the pratas we bought... that was so tasty. Michelle also had her first attempt in making 9-layer kueh last night. Haven't tasted it yet, am sure it will be nice. So last night, our neighbours Dominic and Jinghui came over for prata supper. I had cheese prata with milo Dinosaur.   Today will be my cooking day, haha. Will do my best to cook a nice meal. Anyway I got to go.
