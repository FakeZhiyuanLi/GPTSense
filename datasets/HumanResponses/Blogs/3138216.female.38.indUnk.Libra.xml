       The title of this blog refers to an analogy I thought of for life today -- that of a patchwork quilt.  Like life, a patchwork quilt is made up of bits and pieces found and collected by the craftsperson, and sewn together carefully to form a warm blanket.  Each piece in the quilt is different, different colors, different patterns, different textures.  Like a quilt, I think our lives are sewn together out of our collected experiences.  It can be a real hodgepodge, raggy looking thing, but that quilt keeps us warm.  It's why we're here.  No matter what quilt we've managed to sew up, bit by bit, it's all we have.  It's what we are.  And it's what we can work with as we keep adding to it, day by day.

       April 22, 2004   Woo-hoo!  Today I got on the scale and it read 199.50.  This is the first time I've been below 200 since the 80's.  I also was able to put on a pair of my size 18 jeans this week, which have otherwise been too tight since last fall.  I'm obviously making SOME progress, even if it is slow.  That puts me at having lost 8 pounds since the beginning of March.  It is strange that I still seem a little heavier than last spring, even though the scale is lower.  I know it's because I haven't been weight-training a lot, just doing aerobics, and my muscle mass is lower/fat content higher.  What a crappy trade-off.  I am looking into doing brief periods of strength-training in the morning (re: that 8 minutes in the morning book) to somehow get that back into my week.  My weight training is really too inconsistent right now to do me any good, because I won't give up my walk or bike-ride to do it (since it takes about 45 mins to an hour on its own.)  Maybe just doing one or two exercises a day will make a difference, anyway.  I want that muscle burn!  Today I didn't exercise, but did a speed cleaning of the house, which is practically aerobic on it's own.  Since it takes me over 4 hours solid, it counts (I hope.)  We are going away in two days, so i have been being really good with my eating, knowing on vacation it's going to be tough to stay reasonable.  I was so excited today I set a new goal for myself -- now I want to lose another 65 pounds, to match the 65 pounds I've already lost since starting to lose weight, years ago.  That would put me at 135, when I reach it.  I sure as hell don't know how I'm going to get myself down that far, but it'll be quite a challenge to try and do it before the end of the year!

      Yay, yahoo!  I finally dropped below 199 today, to 197 and a half.  It was hard to tell if it was 197 or slightly above, as my "super-accurate" doctor's scale doesn't seem as precision as it used to be, as the balance shifts as I move around on the scale.  It's pissing me off, but I do know it was definitely below 199. I immediately tested the potential weight loss by trying on clothes that were tight last summer.  Not bad.  Still a ways to go, but at least they were not clinging to me like fabric on an inflated basketball (Re: my gut.)  I'm even wearing my 'skimpy' bikini underwear and it isn't rolling down to my crotch, because of the gut fat.  This is good!  What's bizarre is that I had what constitutes, for me, an actual binge last night.  I had my regular lunch yesterday, but without the fruit, which I was out of.  Then I took a walk.  I didn't have anything to snack on, in the afternoon.  By the time I got back home from work, I was starving.  Too hungry, I guess, as I had a dinner of salad, two bone with skin chicken breasts, an ice cream bar, two hot choclate packets, two oatmeal packets, with honey, and a yogurt.  It was way over the top, but I just couldn't seem to stop eating.  Fortunately, there was little in the house for me to do damage with, which was a good thing, because I was fully prepared to graze through any carb-type munchie in sight.  (Which is why I never bring the damn things home!)  I am not going to let myself go so long without food, in the future.  I almost ALWAYS seem to get hungry about 3:30 to 4:00 in the afternoon.  Bringing something to lessen it before I go home to my biggest meal of the day makes perfect sense.  To celebrate my current weight loss, I walked to my Dad's house in Owosso, about an hour or so walk.  I helped him and Gene lay his huge patio for a while.  Now I'm hungry again and about to go down to my dinner of salad, shrimp and red beans and rice.  Man, it smells great!

      On the subject of gatric bypass surgery -- I was handed an article today that seemed to indicate in pictures and text that Carnie Wilson,  THE bypass poster child of the past few years, has regained a good portion of her weight.  I went to her website and found in her letter to her fans that she had not been exercising, and had stretched her stomach somewhat so she could eat more than she had, after the surgery.  Adding to that the fact that she's just cut a new album with the Wilson-Philips band (no stress there) and it's easy to see she's just fallen off the program bypass patients are put on, to keep their weight under control.  But the point of all this is, the surgery is no 'magic solution' to weight loss.  From my vantage, it just looks like a way to lose weight, faster than ever before, before you are constrained to modify your eating and add exercise to your life, just like all the rest of the fitness slobs out there.  What is the point of the surgery, then?  To give morbidly obese people the quickest way out of their fat possible?  I suppose it does that.  But then, if the bypass patient does not 'get with the program', it all becomes a pointless endeavor, doesn't it?  The fat comes back, the person has to struggle, and it all starts over again, only NOW the person is even without a complete gastric system to carry them through the rest of their lives.  GAH!  Sorry, I'll take losing even just a measly 10 pounds a year, over that scenario.  I'll take never losing another pound again, over keeping all my body parts, thank you.  Carnie says she walks an hour 3-4 times a week and goes to Curves 3 times a week.  Why couldn't she find the motivation to do that before the surgery?  She says the surgery FORCED her to do these things.  Screw that.  Nobody tells ME what to do.  I'll make my own choices when it comes to my body -- and not have to do things because of a self-imposed unnatural medical condition.

      I finally slipped back to 199 today -- about a month after I hit it for the first time, right before my blow-out vacation.  Even though I know I've been losing inches, I'm just happy to see my hard work start getting reflected on the scale.  THIS time, I am not letting the 100's get away from me.  I will hang onto them with friggin' white knuckles, if I have to.  I have a few weeks before the monthly bloat returns, so I'm shooting for a few more pounds down to make me comfortable.  I just installed a BMI calculator on my weblog, and it says that once I hit 190, I will no longer be in the 'obese' category, just 'overweight'.  Splitting hairs, I know, but I'll take all the psychological hefts I can get.  Today was rather challenging.  (re: a pain in the ass.)  Gene's brother came over to help him replace the sidewalk in front of my house, dug up when the water pipe broke this winter.  Chalk up another $150 for that fiasco.  There is water all over my basement from the rains, and the river is now so high you can't even approach the only usable bridge we have in town.  No walk today becaue of it, but I worked like mad sweeping the driveway and walks, hauling bricks and generally running around.  I did take a 15 minute bike ride.  Dinner was hefty again, since I made spagetti, something I never indulge in anymore, because of the huge plate of it I usually have.  Two slices of texas toast accompanied, lots of burger on top, and yes, the two requisite slimfast ice creams.  What a carb meltdown!  The Atkins people would have fainted at the sight of my meal!  But I swear, I want to prove,  you can have one huge plate of pasta and bread, if it's only ONE night, and not blow your program .  It IS doable.  Check back with me in 6 days, and if I haven't lost more weight, doing what I've been doing, I'll eat my shorts.    Still, no more pasta for a while, please!

      Keeping busy the last couple days.  As I noted before, we've been getting a TON of rain lately.  We have thunderstorms nearly every day.  In the last 48 hours we've gotten so much rain the river that goes through our town has jumped it's banks.  Here is a picture.     It really curbed my walk with Gene today, because we couldn't get past some of the water without getting our shoes wet, in order to cross the bridge.  I came back later with my bike and took pictures of as much of the flooding as I could.  What's impressive is that we had a huge thunderstorm within an hour of my shots, and the river is supposed to be even higher by tommorrow afternoon!  This is going to make walking through the part tough for a while.  We'll have to plot out an alternate route.  The good news is: I'm wearing my size 18 jeans today!  I noticed yesterday that some of the skin on my thighs and belly was getting that kind of flaccid look, such as after quick weight loss, so I grabbed my smaller jeans to experiment.  They all fit, one way or another!  Six months ago I couldn't even get them past my thighs, so this is very encouraging!  The scale has still not budged much past it's former, now at 200.5, but my two week dedicated exercise burst is obviously paying off.   I LOVE STRENGTH TRAINING!   I also think doing exercise earlier in the day, as much as six hours earlier than I usually do, is also a factor.  Coupled with my evening walk/bike ride, it's seems to be a winner.  I hope I can continue sneaking in weights at work.  There is something so cool about doing a work-out during company time.  Makes it more enjoyable, and I seem not to rush through it so much.  Of course, when business picks up again in July, I doubt I can continue this on such a scale.  Only May gives me hour upon hour of dead time.  (Much to the chagrin of my father.)  We had a larger than usual dinner tonight -- grilled pork loin with smaller salad, large potato and two 110 cal ice cream bars.  I heaped the butter on the 'tato, but what the hell, I have to have at least one day a week where I can loosen up a bit.  My Body for Life book (by Bill Philips) advocates one day a week where anything goes.  I don't know if I want to pull out the cheesecake once a week all month, but it's nice to know you can blow off some every seventh day, if you want.  I like the Body for Life book and might adopt it as my new manual for this current sprint for the finish.  It seems like I do better if I freshen up my arsenal of weight loss books every once and a while, rather than doing the same old thing, all the time.  The joyce Vedral exercises are old, old, old, at this point.  It'd be nice to get something new to try.

      I almost got an entire upper body workout in today.  I at least did my abs, entirely.  No time for more.  What's bumming me is that for the past week, I've done nothing constructive at all, outside of exercising, when so many things need to be done around here.  I've either watched movies with Gene, or fooled around on the computer.  Gah.  There's only so much inactivity I can take.  What is it about me that has to always be doing something?  I guess I just feel the pressure of things coming up, that will cancel out the things I want to do if I wait too long.  One being going back to school in November.  Once that starts, all bets are off.  Now, suddenly, one of my few web 'clients' is throwing me more work, out of the blue.  And I haven't even gotten to the band site yet.  Time to get serious.  (I do great work under pressure!)  Teah told me today that a friend of hers started exercising, lost inches, and wound up finishing her program at the same weight she started at!  Just proof again that you can slip a pant size without the scale noticing, if you're working out.  I'm going to have to give up my daily weighs, cause the holding pattern on the numbers is too discouraging at the moment.  Once a week on Sunday mornings will have to suffice.

      Been surfing other blogs all evening (man, I've got to stop this) but I was really encouraged to see other people who are exercising and building muscle also noting/bitching about the scale not budging, but seeing the change in other ways.  I feel better now.  Feeling myself getting stronger during the strength training is definitely a plus.  Those weights are getting more easier to manage each time.  I was reminded tonight that I wanted to start biking to work every day, since work is only about five miles away.  With the bridge in town being out, I'd also avoid the long detour I have to take every morning through town traffic.  The problem has been the rainiest May we've seen in years.  If I bike to work, I may get trapped in rain coming back.  But wouldn't that be cool -- biking to and from work, doing weight training during the day AND taking my hour walk in the evening?  My God...  How could I NOT lose weight with all that?  I'll start biking as soon as I can.

      I've made a secondary hobby out of cruising the web in the evenings doing the voyeur thing reading other people's blogs -- preferably about weight loss.  It's really cool getting to peek into other people's lives.  A lot of folks are struggling like I am.  Many people seem to have given up (or given up blogging) if their last dated entry is a year ago or more.  Some are screaming in frustration, others are doing crazy things, like not eating at all.  I've haunted 3fatchicks.com a bit recently and gotten a taste of this weight loss angst before.  It can be either uplifting or wretched to witness.  We all seem to be going through the same process, but experiencing it in different ways.  It's hard to know what to do to get yourself where you want to be, physically.  It's even harder to get yourself into that mental frame of mind to do it.    I had a good day, but come evening I know I overate, just a little.  I had my salad, and three deli meat and cheese pitas.  That's a  lot .  Even when I'm eating that much, I can't seem to help myself.  I probably won't gain weight having a little extra like that, but I certainly won't lose any weight, either.  I seemed to lose the most weight back in March/April when I was having frozen dinners with my salad about 3 days a week, and could closely monitor my calories and portion that way.  Otherwise I kind of fudge it in the evening, and go over the top.  That's a plan then.  Back to the Healthy Choice dinners, at least 3 days a week for dinner.  It certainly can't hurt.  Weight holding steady -- but I was feeling my arms today, and yes, there is muscle now, that wasn't before.  I'll have to make allowances for this muscle growth.  Like I always say, it's not the numbers, but the pant size that counts.  Eventually the muscle growth will plateau and then I'll finally see my scale numbers go down.  Still, I hate waiting.  I also hate that I am bigger than I was at this very same weight a few years ago.  Makes me wanna scream sometimes.  But it's just proof that I've replaced muscle with fat in that time.  I want it back!

      As expected, I biked all over hell and back today.  Actually, it was only from about 1 to 4, timewise, but I pretty much kicked my own ass in that period.  I went all the way to Harmon-Patridge Park (formerly Green Meadows Park), sat in the sun by the river and read my Robbins book for a while.  My lunch was a little heavy, since I broke and picked up a small salad and wrap to go. Grouped with my usual yogurt, fruit and puddings, it was a bit much.  And I ate the chip bag, too!  I hope the headwind I had to bike through to get home burned it all off.  And the hoeing in my flowerbed and paint scraping of the shed next to my backyard.  Yes, scraping my  neighbors  shed.  (Long story.)  Anyway, my weight is down to a respectable 201, but I really need to get some measurements because I think inches lost are really the story at the moment, and not pounds.  I can feel it in my pants, the merciless barometer of all fat.  The sneaked in workouts at the job are paying off, I think.  Dinner was a salad, burger and two ice creams (230 cals.)  I really need to kick this red meat thing.  I have never done well eating cow and losing weight at the same time.  I've got a package of ground turkey for the next few days, but Gene grabbed a huge pork loin for later, too.  Man, I wish I had the balls to go vegetarian.  We are such carnivores!

      Jesus, this goddamn blog is turning into an obsession.  All I do in the evenings is tweak the thing, and mess around with it.  I love the new template.  Very easy to work with.  Unforunately I accidently deleted all my posts for April last night.  Well, actually I deleted them without knowing they'd disappear from the archives, too.  Oh, well.  It's just words (and rather boring ones, at that.)  I like having a journal, though.  I've never been able to keep one successfully before in paper form, and it seems easier to do on the computer. For one thing, I can type faster than I handwrite.    I have to get working on a website I'm doing for a friend though.  With $100 in the pocket, I can't keep putting it off...  Today I did my upper body strength workout, in total.  Then an hour walk with Gene.  I have tommorrow off and plan to bike as much as possible.  The weather is supposed to be near perfect.  Screw the home projects that need my attention, screw the web design work that needs to be done, screw the ebaying I need to do to make some cash -- I'm goin' biking to the park or wherever.  I can always do all that stuff on Sunday.  (All of it in one day -- wow!)

      Blogger just updated their templates to some nice looking examples, so I picked a new one -- I really don't have the time to sit around designing one of my own (although it would be fun.)  Yesterday I took a friend out for her birthday and did okay considering we wound up having dinner at a buffet place called "Fire Mountain."  After having my usual safe low-fat lunch, at the buffet I had a huge salad and bun with honey-dijon dressing.  Then, even though I felt full, I had a mixed plate of carrots, small piece of steak, wedge of ribs, stuffed potato and a biscuit.  I skipped the dessert, but had two of my own 100 cal puddings later.  So, not great, but not a wipe-out, either.  I made sure to take my usual 55 minute walk before the day was out, also.  I am really going to try and dodge socializing for a while so I can make some progress.  In the "old days" of my first weight loss, I was almost a recluse, and keeping exact control over my eating was easier because I never went out.  Now it's much harder with hosting dinners and 'having lunch' etc.  That's one of the things keeping me from losing much weight this time.  I do good for five days, then 'let it slide' for two.  (What you might call 'weekend eating.')  All I can figure is that I'll have to mentally prepare myself for any outings, choose in advance what I'll have, and visualize myself actually following my decisions.  Then just do it!  I got an entire lower body strength training session in today.  More strength this time, less pain.  I'm also looking forward to my walk with Gene tonight.  He's grilling for dinner, so I have to resolve to have only one of whatever he's cooking.  My 'theory of one' works pretty good, when I stick to it.  One salad, one this, one that.  No more than one.  And that seems to help.

       May 15, 2004   For the past few days I've done pretty good on the eating side, about the same menu as I posted last time, except for rice with shrimp last night, which was kind of excessive.  (Too much rice!)  The weights work-out three days ago really laid the pain on, unfortunately.  For about two and a half days, my thighs were destroyed.  This isn't uncommon when I start my strength training program again, after going off it cold for about five to six weeks.  It's like starting over.  It made my walks for the last two evenings more like a fast hobble.  But the bad part is past, now, and it won't hurt like that again as long as I at least do the lower body training once a week.  This is the squats, leg kick ups, scissors kind of stuff we all love to hate.  It sucks, but man, it does shed the inches like a mother!  And I like the idea that my strength is increasing.  The thought of my muscles atrophying just does not excite me too much.    Nothing much happening on the scale.  My weight keeps creeping up either because of muscle gain, or the fact that it's been hot (water retention), or that my bathroom habits have not been regular lately.  I've been exercising my ass off, so this is the first time it's been a bummer not seeing some progress.  Patience, patience.

       May 12, 2004   Reporting on another wasted weekend --  well, mother’s day went pretty much as expected.  I made too much food, and my sister brought an additional pie that was just gross, but I had to have two pieces of it, naturally, (one to try, and one to finish it off.)  It took me TWO days to eliminate the leftovers from that affair, and now that my period’s on again, who knows what the hell my weight is now.  Fluctuating between 202 and 204, depending on which way the wind is blowing, at the moment.  We had an interesting conversation at dinner that brought to my attention that I have a distinct problem wasting food, at any time.  My sister left a huge amount of pasta on her plate that I absolutely hated having to throw away.  In addition to hating to throw away food, I also ALWAYS clean my plate.  None of these impulses are working in my favor.  I’ve been reading Tony Robbins’ book “Awaken the Giant Within”, and he offers many conditioning techniques to help rid myself of these ingrained habits.  I love Tony.  He advocates that we first have to  -- 1) Want change, 2) Know exactly why we want the change 3) Then take massive action to make the change.  He suggests ‘interrupting’ patterns and then replacing the pleasure we gained from the old habit with pleasure from a new source, and associating GREAT pain with the old habit.  Three or four years ago I started but didn’t finish this book, but now I seem ready for it.  It makes more sense now.  I’ve decided to use his ideas to help reach my goal.  I also gave myself a major kick in the rear last night when I realized that on June 17th we’re going on another trip, this time with Dad to Lake Tahoe, which looks like heaven on earth, by the pictures.  I refuse to be heavy going on that trip.  I made a major, massive commitment last night to give my all, right now, and quit playing these games of ‘eating out’ and ‘making dinner’ for a while.  It’s just not worth it.  To inaugurate my commitment, I somehow squeezed an entire lower bod strength training work-out in   while I was at work !  It’s so damn slow at the store in May, it was actually possible.  Then I still went for my walk with Gene in the evening.  It was quite an achievement.  I also kept my eating quite low-key, and sitting here now, I’m going into the first stages of late-night hunger, so I know I did good.  I’m gonna burn all night.  Here was today’s menu:   Lunch at 11:30  1 no-fat blueberry yogurt (100 cals) 1 peaches in gel (70 cals) 1 Lean Cuisine (190 cals) kind of low for a cuisine, they’re usually higher 2 low-fat puddings (180 cals)  (BTW: that is my lunch every day, any day, except on vacation, and if I am eating out with someone.  The only thing that changes is the flavor of the yogurt, the fruit, and the lean cuisine I’m having.  Healthy choice is good too!)   Snack at 4  1 peaches in gel (70 cals)   Snack at 5:30 (bloody starving after all that exercise on the job)  Strawberry/yogurt smoothie (250 cals)   Dinner at 6:45  Large spinach and greens salad with croutons, shredded cheese, mushrooms, imitation seafood, sunflower seeds and low-fat ranch and sour cream dressing.  (Unknown cals – but probably 300-500 the way I use the dressing)  Boneless, skinless chicken breast with shredded cheese and sour cream in a small tortilla wrap. (400-500 cals)  1 slimfast ice cream bar. (110 cals)  Its reasonable to assume my calorie count was around 1700-2000 for the day, pretty respectable with all the exercise I did.  I didn’t feel deprived until now – hungry at midnight, but the remedy for that is GO TO BED.  Night!

       May 7, 2004   Today, a week after vacation, I'm at 202, only three pounds over what I started at  before  vacation.  I biked into town yesterday (about an hour round trip) and walked with Gene the usual hour, so I got plenty of activity.  But don't tell me my world doesn't still revolve around food -- I'm wildly plotting the Mother's Day Meal on Sunday with religious zest.  We're now having beef stroganoff, salad (gotta have some veggies), breadsticks and peach cobbler with vanilla Ice cream.  I'm slow-cooking the stroganoff and cobbler, to free up my time on Sunday a bit.  I'm going to have about 5-6 people to feed, total, so I'm planning on making a lot.  And it's not these meals that wipe me out, per say, but the amount of leftovers I sometimes have when it's all over.  I just can't seem to gauge how much I need.  (Or make too much on purpose...)  My sister says she never weighs herself trying to lose weight, otherwise the numbers would discourage her.  I must be the only wacko who enjoys playing the numbers game on my stupendously accurate doctors scale.  I get on  every  day.  It keeps me focused on what I'm trying to accomplish.  My mind doesn't scream "failure!" if the numbers go up -- I just tell myself that I'm bloated with water, or am constipated, or need to cut down a bit and step up the exercise.  I try a little harder.  I change my approach.  Whatever.    I told Gene that I think most people put themselves on a 'diet' they can't wait to get off of, instead of just living day-to-day on a plan they like and that keeps them healthy and bumps off the pounds, eventually.  If the weight fluctuates while on a 'diet', a person panics, because they need results FAST and NOW so they can go back to what they were eating again, soon.  The 'on' 'off' diet mentality destroys a lot of people, when just sticking to a reasonable daily regime of calories and foods and scheduling some 'cheat' dates every month might carry them for the rest of their lives.  There are certain foods I never eat at home now, just on certain occasions.  I like Cheetoes when I'm at the lake up north.  I like chocolate at the movie theater.  (We don't go to the movies much, thank god.)  I never carry any of that crap into the house, because once it's there, it's hard to get out.

       May 4, 2004   Last night I dreamt about food -- cake and brownies, to be specific.  I was at some kind of festival where they were selling huge slices of some kind of brownie pie, and I was panicking because it was disappearing so fast!  I tasted this brownie/cake and it was soooo good.  Funny thing is, I hate brownies, even though I love chocolate.  But I kept grabbing this stuff up in the dream, and chasing all over trying to get more (eating as I went.)  It was kind of like a replay of my vacation.  *snort*  Well, now I know when my next planned extravagence is going to be.  Mother's Day is this weekend and I've decided to host dinner for Mom at my house.  It looks like pasta is going to be on the menu, one way or another.  Either beef stroganoff or chicken with a pasta side.  Mmm-mmm.  Gene and I were also plotting bringing in KFC chicken wings as an appetizer.  Is it NO WONDER I can never lose much past ten pounds with these events going on every month?  (That I always expect to eat a lot on?)  At least it keeps me on track the rest of the week, knowing I have something cool coming down the line.  I still overate a little tonight, having two pieces of rye toast with butter I didn't need.  What a carb-aholic I am.  Gene and I have been doing great with the walks, though.  And I got in one upper body work-out over the weekend.  I upped my weights for once and actually felt some ache afterward in my arms and chest, which means I actually  did  something.  Still too cold and rainy to bike.  I hate Michigan.  We must have 12 lousy weeks a year to enjoy any nice weather at all.

       May 3, 2004   Well, in order to be brief, I'm just going to post the pertinent part of a letter I just sent to a web friend.    "Gene and I just got back from a short trip to Niagara Falls last week.  We arrived back on Thursday and on Friday morning I found out I'd put on 8 pounds during a five day trip!  Yow!  And that was with walking several miles almost every day.  Of course, we WERE staying in a B and B, where the hostess served us a FULL breakfast every day, something I'd never have, normally.  We had everything from crepes, to pancakes to french toast.  About the only healthy thing I had at those meals was the yogurt.  And I also had chocolate after dinner every night (my weak spot.)  I would have had ice cream every day, but it was so friggin' cold, there was no way.    But there's nothing like having two months of weight loss wiped out in part of a week.  I'm not going to cry until a week passes and I can see how bad the damage really is...  I'm back on my usual program, but it's really taught me that my success in weight loss is really balanced on the head of a pin right now, and can't handle that many days of gluttony.  (One, yes.) Maybe I'll learn my lesson and get over this 'food holiday' thing, once and for all."  That pretty much sums it up.  Total blowout, all around.  But we did HAVE FUN!  And I have lost two pounds of that 8 so far, so maybe it won't take me another two months to scrape it off.  I wish I could learn moderation on holiday, though.  Oh, well.

      My weight dropped another 2 pounds last night putting me at only 3 pounds above my lowest weight this month.  I will be happy when I get back to my lowest, though.  In the meantime, I'm sticking with my usual program, although doing my weight routine at work has become hit and miss now.  The slow season is offically over, and business fluctuates from mildly steady to flat-out nuts.  I did my upper body routine completely yesterday, but haven't been able to complete my lower body stuff entirely at least once this week.    Feeling way funky right now -- I think it's something I ate for dinner.  Please, God, don't let me have food poisoning.  I'm just thinking about the bulk salad I ate from Meijer's that I neglected to wash.  It sits out in open bins in the store.  Good move.  But I also had a frozen vegetable dish I've never had before, tonight, and I think it's giving me gas.  Mandarin vegtables it was called, with fruit and vegs together.    I should go to bed early tonight, anyway.  I haven't been getting enough sleep for days.  Here is another picture from vacation that more clearly shows why I need to lose weight.  I have a very small upper body, and in some pictures it really doesn't look like I have all that much weight to lose.  Well, folks, with me, it's all settled around my middle.  I wear a 14/16 top and a size 18/20 pants.  You can kind of see it here, somewhat.

      I'm back from vacation!  Boy, it was fun!  Gene and I went to Lake Tahoe in Nevada/California (it's right on the border) with my Dad. Here is a pic of Gene and I at 10,000 feet.     We spent four days at the lake, staying at the Harvey's Casino Hotel.  Two days we spent traveling to get there.  I broke my ass trying not to gain weight on this trip, but of course, I did.  We ate at buffets four days straight, and I tried to limit myself to one plate each time, but usually had more.  I was so sick of the buffet at Harrah's by the time we left I was dying to get back to my "routine".  The only nice thing about the buffet was that it was at the top of the hotel, on the 18th floor.  Great view, but the food left a lot to be desired.    Here is a shot of me and Dad in the mountains:    We also ate at a seafood buffet which was better, but I gorged myself -- and at a nice Italian restaurant, which I enjoyed but where Gene got food poisoning.  All in all, we might have been better off going down the street to Quizno's for a sandwich.  Exercise wise, I did well.  The day of departure, I biked for 50 minutes.  The next day, I sought out the "fitness center" at each of the hotels -- since Harrah's owns Harvey's, I had my choice of both.  Harvey's was a nice, glassed in area with a view, but wanted $15 bucks a day to use their equipment.  Harrah's gym was in a basement room, with no view, but was free (at least, no one challenged me for money.)  I used Harrah's exercise bike and weight equipment twice.  I loved using the weight equipment -- it was my first time sampling those things.  It was really neat to see what kind of weight I could handle on each machine.  The problem was, I felt self-conscious anytime anyone was in the room while I was working out.  The people at Tahoe are all buffed babes.  I guess I'll have to get over that if I ever want to use a real gym.   Our second day I HAD to rent bikes for me and Gene so we could hit the trails around the lake.  I took Gene with me on a fairly easy ride down to the lake, with great views.  After that, he was bushed (see the pic above -- Gene is not exactly prime biking material, at the moment)  and went back, while I forged ahead to try out an actual MOUNTAIN BIKE TRAIL.  It was a trail marked "moderate". Yeah, right.  With the air thinner at 8,000 feet, and pushing myself and the bike up hill after hill, I was lucky to make it out alive.  I estimate I biked around 25 miles that day, with lots of uphill.  Near the end of the day, I was totally exhausted.  I really nearly killed myself, especially when I started going the wrong way, all uphill.  It was what Gene calls "kicking my own ass", which I usually try to do on vacation.  I succeeded this time.  There was no more biking for me on that trip -- I didn't have any strength left for anything but slow walks.    My weight today was 201.25, up about five from my lowest this month.  I'm back on my routine and giving myself another four days to let the trip fade away...

      The week is going pretty much as expected.  With the salt I had Monday, my period starting, coupled with two outrageous days of heat, my weight has been hovering around 198.  The way I see it, having ONLY a two pound gain is pretty miraculous, under the circumstances.  I figure once the tide washes out next week, I'll be at 195.  We'll see!  Still, I haven't gone an iota over 200 since the end of May, so I'm declaring the 200's officially OVER.  No going back now.  My only problem, as noted before, will be getting in and out of my vacation without going ballistic.  I'm trying to think of ways to come through it with minimal damage.  One thing I'm going to do is pay the extra $10 a day to use the exercise room at our fabulous hotel.  I'm sure the exercise room will be just as fabulous.  (Hopefully with a view of the mountains or lake -- wouldn't that be cool!)  I remember riding a stationary bike in our 4 star hotel in London, Ontario, and it was the best ride on a stationary I'd ever had.  I'm looking forward to having that experience again.  I finally went ahead and bought the book written by the " urlLink Chunk to Hunk " Guy.  His weight loss story is amazing, insofar as how fast he lost it, just exercising and changing his eating.  He didn't starve himself, just gave up sugar, fried food, most red meat, and white, processed bread.  I guess if you dump all that, you can't help but shed the pounds.  I swear he must have lost a pound a day for the first three months.  Of course, he started out at 370 pounds, too.  I noticed that as he wrote his journal, he was reading Anthony Robbins "Awaken the Giant Within", as all of Robbin's concepts are echoed almost chapter for chapter in his posts.  He really seems to have tried to use all the "change technology" offered in the book.  I intellectually understand everything the book advocates, but usually only practice the concepts in spurts.  To get off the subject, I'd like to discuss cravings.  To be honest, I only crave foods when I smell them.  I am all olfactory.  But when I crave something after smelling it, I REALLY crave it, bad.  For instance, my evil boss left some KFC friend chicken thing covered in BBQ sauce sitting in the refrigerator at work.  I picked it up, smelled it and tasted it today.  Naturally, even cold, that damned thing tasted great.  Now I can't get KFC out of my friggin' mind.  I still imagine I can smell it on my hands.  I love their BBQ anything like mad -- just not anything else they make.  I suppose I should just eat the little piece at the store and get it out of my system.  If I don't go and buy a whole box of anything, it can't do too much damage!

      Great workout day -- biked to work, did my entire lower bod strength training with abs, biked home, then whipped through an entire walk, which I suddenly noticed I can now complete in 45 minutes, NOT an hour.  So the hour walk is no more, unless I tack on more distance (which I may.)  The intensity of the walk is pretty good, though, especially if I walk to music, using a cd player and headphones.  I'm doing enough.  Who needs more minutes?  The bummer today was the fact that I had two home-cooked hamburgers with dinner instead of one, and then we went out to the movies -- another place where the snack demon can ambush me.  I ordered a frozen cherry drink thinking that would keep me busy without causing too much damage, but then Gene got the huge tub of popcorn and poured that wonderful cheese and garlic salt on it.  I must have eaten half the tub.  And this is mere hours before my period starts, so you can imagine the outrageous bloat I've just signed up for.  Oh, well.  At least I didn't eat any chocolate while I was there.  Score one for me, because chocolate and going to the movies have been synonymous until now.  But what did Scarlett say...?  "Tommorrow is another day" or some crap like that.  Yeah, go Scarlett.  I'm not going near the #$%@*&! scale until next week.

      I cannot figure out how to get blogger to stop showing more than thirty days worth of posts.  I'll have to see if they offer any tech support...  I think I forgot to mention that I started biking to work on June 2nd, since it seems to have finally stopped raining in Michigan.  What I discovered was that the ride is only about 11 minutes one way, which is no great outing.  That's about 22 minutes total bike time, round trip.  Still, every little bit helps, and with gas prices the way they are now, saving some of that doesn't hurt, either.  What's strange is, because of the detour I'm forced to take by car with the bridge being out, the trip to work is about the same length, by car OR bike.  Let's see -- eating could have been better for most of the past four days.  Gene made fatty pork ribs a few nights ago, and the fat was just unreal.  It was gross, but i still ate it.  (I love ribs!)  I told him no more of that.  Then I had lunch out with Terry on Friday, as mentioned, and had a huge plate of Oriental buffet.  Only one, but it was enough.  Today, I went to an open house where I just let myself go, two plates full of pasta, meatballs, deviled eggs and a sausage PLUS brownies and cookies for dessert.  Jesus, and I don't even like brownies that much.  I'm gonna have to turn the screws this week, cause next week is, yes, ANOTHER VACATION, starting the 17th.  God, please help me.  I am a weak, weak, sinner on vacation.  But I cannot afford another gain like I had during the April trip.  Steps will have to be taken.  I collared a whole bunch of new exercise and diet books to look at from the Fenton Road store.  I want to try and introduce a little change into my weight training, so my bod doesn't get too used to it (and I don't get bored.)  It seems what I'm doing now is fairly optimal as a fat burning and toning workout, though, so I think I'll stick with it.  (To recap: I'm using Joyce Vedral's "Bottoms Up" workout, which lets you just bang through the workout by exercising different muscles alternately  -- you can eliminate rests, if you want.)  So that's--  22 minutes biking to work (about 4 days a week.) 45 to 60 minutes strength training on work days (about 4 days a week) 60 minutes walking or biking every day   That means 3-4 days a week I'm doing almost 2 1/2 hours of exercise.  Other days, only one hour.  Good grief, as I've said, how can I NOT lose weight if I keep this up!  If I could get an even better handle on my eating, nothing could stop me!

      The strength training is finally paying off on the scale, at last.  It takes a while for the results to build to show up with number loss.  I'm at 196.25 today (I only put 196.5 above, because counting quarter pounds seems a bit odd.)  Almost 14 pounds down, now.  While the numbers held steady, I managed to drop a pants size and slip back into my size 18 pants, ALL of them.  It's nice to get that part of my wardrobe back!  Basically, I figure I'm now, size-wise, where I was in May or June/July of last year.  (Or was it August -- can't remember.)  This is the time where I see if I will keep pushing to make progress beyond that 'break-even' point.  History seems to dictate that I'll lose at least ten more pounds before getting distracted.  I'm psyching myself to do much better than that.  I'd like to hold this momentum for all year, if possible.  I want to establish my recent changes and additions as the 'norm', from now on.  If i don't, I know the weight will come creeping back.  My trial today will be lunch with Terry at a small Oriental buffet.  Last time I went to this buffet, I did manage to limit myself to one plate.  I will be biking to the restaurant to off-set the calorie blitz that's sure to come.  I'm also going to have 'healthy choice' dinners as my main course in the evening for the next two days.

      This has been the longest I've gone without posting since I started this blog!&nbsp; Fact is, there hasn't been much to report this month.&nbsp; Just holding steady, steady, steady.&nbsp; I bounce continually between 196 and 198.&nbsp; I've taken some awesome bike rides lately, but I haven't had much time for weight training anymore, so that has been reduced to once a week, at best.&nbsp; I also haven't been biking to work as much.&nbsp; I'm afraid to lose muscle mass, even though that would probably cause me to lose on the scale, but give me a greater propensity to gain fat.&nbsp; I can't tell you how, in the past, I would get lazy on my exercise and start to gain weight -- pants getting tighter, etc -- only the scale would stay the same.&nbsp; What a brutal exchange.&nbsp; But my pants are not getting tighter, as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Still comfy in my 18's.&nbsp; Maybe even comfier.&nbsp; I have not given up. I was a decent 196.25 this morning, and I'm focusing as hard as I can on the eating side of it.&nbsp; A website called calorie King predicted that I would lose well eating about 1800 calories a day.&nbsp; Too bad I eat about 2000, then.&nbsp; I wish I could pare off that extra 200 calories.&nbsp; It would help on those days I'm being "good" and not giving myself extra things to eat.  I wish I could call this a "plateau", but I certainly haven't lost enough weight this year, for that.&nbsp; It's just fudging, fudging, fudging, plain and simple.&nbsp; I dreamt about chocolate this morning, again, for chrissake.&nbsp; Someone told me that meant I was depriving myself.&nbsp; I know I'm not, but I obviously must think I am, to myself.&nbsp; That's probably why I give myself so many treats -- to reward myself for being so "good".&nbsp; I have to learn that the real treat would be meeting some of my goals -- not having a brief moment of pleasure when I eat something.  I would be happy just getting to 190 on the scale, right now.&nbsp; I  really, really  want to do that!&nbsp; I mean it!

      Yes, just tacked another day on the wasted weekend.  This one was a lot more enjoyable.  The weather was nicer, and I spent most of the day alone with Gene.  Took lunch outside (the usual, modified with hungarian pastries in place of the fruit and dessert) and ran errands until 2:00.  Then Gene and I went for a bike ride -- his first ever on the bike I scored from my sister this Spring.  We just went along the river trail into town, but he seemed to take to it well.  I'm hoping it leads to more bike rides together in the future.    As it was, I had to leave him behind for most of this one, because I go at a much faster pace than he can maintain.  He followed me almost to the end of the trail, then went back while I forged ahead to Harmon-Patridge Park, on the edge of Owosso.  I picked up a snack of string cheese and fruit ( fruit  for God's sake -- actual real fruit!) to have in the park.  I had what is being termed a "donut peach" and an apricot.  The peach was great -- I've always loved peaches.  Maybe I should start trying them in their natural state, and not so much out of a plastic container.  That was all and good -- a nice long ride -- and when I returned I actually cut most of the backyard lawn at an accelerated rate.  Dinner was BBQ again, consisting of a chicken breast, skin and all, a leftover hamburger from last night, and a leftover piece of rib.  Also a salad and small potato with butter.  Pretty sizable.  The capper was when we went to the theater to see "Spiderman 2" and Gene went for the tub of popcorn again, smothered in flavored salt.  I had to eat half of that, of course, along with the cookies and pastries I brought from home.  Yeah, I've had it.  Soooo damn ready to go back to "clean" eating, I could puke.  What really pisses me off is that two of the "bad" foods I had in the house this weekend were given to me -- the cookies and the tiny cinnamon cake which is still sitting down there, uneaten.  Why the hell do people who  KNOW  you are trying to lose weight give you food all the time?  As in, "Oh, you liked one of those?  Well, take two or three (or ten or twelve) home with you, love."  Somehow I must learn to form the words "NO."  I can't have those things in my house.  If they are there, I will eat them.  Plain and simple.  Okay, the pastries were my fault, but dammit, I only buy those things once a year.  I won't eat them until the 4th rolls back again.  I had the balls to sign up for the National Weight Control registry I read about in TIME magazine last month.  They sent me a packet which I just filled out and mailed back today.  The registry, which is actually a study, is for those people who have lost at least 30 pounds and kept it off for 3 years or more.  They are only interested in people who have maintained their loss.  When I sat down to do the figuring, I determined that my initial 30 pound loss, down from my highest weight, has been maintained for 5 years.  5 years!  In that time, I've never gone up more than 10-12 pounds from whatever weight I had lost down to at that moment.  Part of that is because I made a vow NEVER to let myself go up a pant size, once I was down to a particular one.  That's why you're seeing me do this intense, focused (sloppy, fudged) version of my program, at the moment.  I was in an 18 last year, but went back up to a 20 over the winter.  My highest pant size ever was a 28.  I can assure the world that I will NEVER be in a 28 anything, ever again.  But I would really like to see myself in a size 12, before I die.    Only 7 weeks until my next vacation!  Woo-hoo!  Time to get to work!

      Yesterday was the 4th of July, a national holiday.  It may as well have been  Christmas  according to how I ate for half the day.  I started out with good intentions, having a nice, typical lunch.  We went to the park where the 4th celebration was going on and I stayed clean until about 3, when the afternoon munchies started creeping up on me.  Around two I munched on just a couple of choclate covered things at a friend's house, but at the park I bought two platter of kolkache's (hungarian pastries) which I had to sample two from.  They are small, so it was no big deal, but then I had a choclate chip cookie (palm-size) and wound up eating half of a fries and chili thing Gene bought from a vendor.  And it tasted  great , too.  Bleah!  To offset all this crap, I made sure I took what constituted my regular walk, at a brisk pace.  After I got back, I had to clean up a mess in our kitchen from a slow-cooker overboil, and by the time I was done, I was hungry.  At my friend's house we had BBQ'd ribs and hamburgers.  I had half a plate of ribs, two burgers on bun, chips with dip (just a few), cheetos (more than a few) some potato salad, some salad I couldn't identify, two or three Pepsi's (hate soft-drinks), a lemonade, and at least two huge brownies and a couple of cookies.  THEN, when I got home I started binging on the kolache's at 11:00 at night, stopping at half the plate.  It was the most revolting display of excess I've seen from myself in a LONG time.  I'm not sure what triggered it, other than the fact that the day didn't go exactly the way we wanted (it rained all day) and the fact that I really wanted to be somewhere else for a great deal of it.  I was also mentally prepared to eat like a horse in the evening, so I guess that's what I did, and then some.  I think it's ironic that on a day where I was walking around, feeling super-comfortable in my size 18's, thinking the damn things might even be feeling a little LOOSE, at last, that I would just go to town on junk.  Actually, it's not ironic, I'm pretty sure I do that a lot -- if I feel I'm making good progress, I take that as a sign that I can get sloppy today, and eat what I want.  Well, maybe I could eat what I want for ONE DAY.  It's never one day with me, though, it's usually two days, and my program just gets ground to a halt when I do.  Not derailed, just sidelined.  I'm not going to whine about it.  It all comes down to choice.  Obviously I wanted to eat that food more yesterday than I wanted to continue losing weight.  Now I just have to decide what it is I want today and take the steps to ensure it happens.  If that means throwing away the cookies Terry gave me last night, so be it.  Damn those kolaches, I don't think I can throw them away, they're great, and I only have them once a year.

      Down to 197 today, now only about 1 pound above my pre-vacation lowest weight.  Overall, my recovery from this trip has been much faster than after my trip to Niagara Falls in April.  I attribute much of that to lots of activity during the trip, and lots of new fat-burning muscle that is keeping me metabolically stoked most of the time.  I am  dying  to get down to 191, now.  I know that particular number will remove me from the mythological "obese" category on the lovely BMI scale, and file me accordingly under simply "overweight."  Obese is such an unattractive label -- I won't miss it.  Question -- am I the only human being on earth who thinks you can lose weight on more than 1,500 calories a day?  I've  ALWAYS  eaten around 2,000 calories a day, and at the beginning of my weight loss journey (at 265 with a BMI of 41.5) I ate at 2,300.  That was codependent upon me doing walking or cycling 4-5 times a week, of course, and eating low-fat.    Okay, I know I'm not the only person who believes that -- it was Susan Powter's book that clued me to the "way", all those years ago.  And she was right.  It worked!  "Stop the Insanity!" (meaning stop the dieting) entirely lived up to it's premise.  Exercising moderately, changing my eating habits, going low-fat, ALL moved the fat off.  AND allowed me to do it without EVER going hungry.  Not ever.  Not even once.  How the hell can you ever GET hungry eating 2,300 a day?  I never could.  I think the problem with other weight loss plans, like Weight Watchers, is that they are selling product, and they know their "buyers" want results -- fast and NOW.  Anything less than a 3-5 pound drop a week is considered ludicrous, and a waste of time.  So the calories are cut down, to get those results.  Here's a clue, folks -- the most I ever lost in a month when I was doing the program -- "eating and moving" (as Susan puts it) is about 8 pounds.  That was a really good month.  I may have lost ten, once or twice.  Generally I lost about 5 or 6 a month.  Now, closer to goal, I only lose about 4 to 5 a month.  That's normal.  And expected.  And there is no need at all for me go hungry or deprive myself enormously to "hurry up" my weight loss.  According to Susan's book, if I sat on my ass, doing nothing, I would still require 1,450 calories a day.  If I exercise even an eensy bit, though, that number jumps to 1,880.  Then to 2,030 (exercise 4-5 times a week.)  These days, I do more activity than even that, and I could potentially consume up to 2,180 calories a day EVEN NOW!  Let's face it -- I'm not perfect -- I've ALWAYS fudged a little on my programs, about 5 to 15% of the time.  If I hadn't, my results would probably have been even better, now and in the past.  But so what?  Am I in a race?  As long as I kept any losses off and maintained within 5-8 pounds of any previous loss I've always been pretty happy.  And maintenance has always been a breeze, keeping around 2,000 to 2,200 cals every single day (vacations and splurges aside.)  I think Susan puts it best in her book:  " Do you want to know how I went from 260 to what I look like now?  The minute I went from the 260-pound column over to the moderate-activity level and started eating 2,300 calories a day.  Yep,  the second I stopped dieting and started eating , the process began."   That sentence changed my life.  I never would have made it this far without that revolutionary (to me) revelation.  I HATE BEING HUNGRY!

      I'm still two pounds over what I weighed at my lowest last month.  I would like to point out that I AM working with a slight handicap, however.  For the first time in as long as I can remember, I had a period TWICE in the same month.  Yes, it's true.  I had one in early June, then 22 days later, here she comes again.  It was right after getting back from vacation, so the water weight I suddenly put on before I started had me really confused.  Gene thinks it was the trip, being in the mountain with the thinner air, etc, etc.  I think my body was just synching up with the full moon.  The female menstrual cycle and the phases of the moon have always been associated in human lore.  Why not?  Needless to say, I'm still in it, so I'm  hoping  when it blows off I'll be at a decent weight.  My eating has been very sloppy this week, however.  I took Gene out for his birthday on Sunday night to a Mexican restaruant where I had a Black Angus beef fajita that was very good.  We also had an appetizer of dips to go with the tortilla chips on the table, and a sopapia (sp?) for dessert. Then I had chocolate at the movie theaters, on top of it.  The next day, I had that meal again when I ate Gene's leftover's of his fajita. Tuesday was also a wash, as I had a yogurt, fruit and bisquick biscuits with butter for breakfast (too many), then turned around and had a full turkey sandwich for lunch, and frito chips in the afternoon.  Dinner was large that day, too.  So only in the last two days have I been pretty okay with my eating.  With that track record, I guess it's a miracle that I'm only at 198.    I have been relentless in my exercise regime, though.  I believe I skipped one day, Monday, for some reason, but otherwise I took either a walk or bike ride every day.  I still advocate that exercise is the only way to keep from blimping out in times of very poor eating.  I really think being active during my vacation helped keep me from just putting on a ton of weight.  The few pounds I did gain are going away rapidly.  I wish that my strength training could be more right now, but with the store being back in the busy season, I'm lucky to get in 15-20 minutes of training with free weights a day.  Still, it does help to do any little bit, especially early in the day when it can boost my metabolism and energy level.  I was thinking of joining Weight Watcher's, but now that I've been told some things about their program, I'm reconsidering.  I've found that most weight organizations are nuts when it comes to the food part of the program.  They want to starve, starve, starve you, and it just doesn't work.
