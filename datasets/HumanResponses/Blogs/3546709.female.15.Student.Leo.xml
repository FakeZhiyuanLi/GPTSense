      Okay I don't know the F you think you are but I have had enough to last me my whole life.I thought if you were rich that you'd at least by your self a clue and leave us alone.You act as though you know what's happening but yah don't cause your to much of a b**** to even take your head outta your @$$ and realize that this has nothing to do with you AT ALL!You don't even know what started this,who's who and what happened when we were fighting!You make me wanna scream!Every time we say sorry you have to go and open your trap and say something stupid and make us say sorry to Cara again and again for your dumb@$$ comments!So next time you have something to say raise your hand and place it over your mouth!You don't seem to get the point that we are trying to be friends again with Cara and that what we said on the Blogs means nothing to her.So unless you have something to say that won't sound so stupid that people's head won't have to turn into mush to even understand it,don't even try to type.                                          Hope I never have to read another of your comments ever again,                      Carolann

      ok cara like i said in the note do not take into consideration what ever was said because it was said out of anger  who ever is this Samantha M. Holdenberg(w/e) you don't me or my friends therefore i don't know where you got your info BUT STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS  because if you haven't noticed your making everything worse we(rachel&carolann)are trying to remain friends with cara and fix our fight that we had so there for STAY OUT OF IT you rich snob and to cara  you are one of my best friends out of the whole world and i know that this is gonna take time to get over but your my sista  and i don't want us to not be friends carolann feels the same way we love you like a sister and neither of us want to be enemies anymore if i can regret one thing it would be saying all of those bad things you have my sincere apologies i want you to know that camamama b**** is a phase from South Park  lylas ~Rachel and Carolann
