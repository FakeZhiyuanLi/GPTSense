      I meant to post this yesterday. But, hell, I forgot. It aint no thang. So here it be:  Fantasia, Fantasia, Fantasia --- she is so Mary J. slammed into Aretha sprinkled with little Macy Gray treats --- and I'm glad she won. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that precious sweet-tart, Diana --she could wail decades beyond her 16 years. (Though, her perkiness left me oddly dehydrated on many occasions... but, again, she's a puppy, she'll be paper-trained soon.) But, that Fantasia!!! Between her "Bo-boing" and her "thug-in-harmony" attitude - that child could shine. Shine, like a great big ol Cadillac hood ornament. I love her.   So what? I like American Idol. I like rooting for someone each week. Hell, I even like Paula Abdul! No, wait... I LOVE Paula Abdul. And speaking of... she looked flawless last night. And did you see her dress...err... her chest? I thought the twin-laker-girls were gonna come out and start tumbling. Regardless, she was very hot. Very "hurry, hurry lover come to me" hot. She'll be 42 next month. Bless the hell out of her.  Simon's okay. I love him. Then I hate him. But I love to hate him. On the other hand, it wouldn't bother me a bit if Randy went way of Biggie and TuPac and had some irrate William-Hung-knock-off take him out. I can't stand him. He's just a punk. And, he's not even a cool black guy. Couldn't even  be a cool white guy. Maybe a cool asian guy...but then at that point, is it even worth it? He's too big to fit in a Honda Prelude anyway. Okay, I'll take off the hood, now.  Anyway, that's my 2 pennies regarding American Idol. It was a'ight. Entirely too long (2 hours!) --- But, I got to see Ms. Kelly Clarkson sing. I love her. She's very old-school Mariah, but exponentially more down to earth. And she's just cute as a Padington-Bear-button too! Hope she hurries up with that new cd... Miss Independent is startin to need some crutches. Some help. She's done wore plum out.

      I will not be manipulated. I will not be controlled. I will not be made to feel guilty. Not anymore. Is that okay?  Transparency. Indignation. Self-serving monologues - bore me into a state of unrescuable unconsciousness. Monotonous words of desperation, frustration, and justification serve me no good. Acts of relentless finger-pointing, emotional blackmail, and self-righteousness drain immeasurable amounts of strength from my soul. Is that okay?  I will not be used. Traded. Borrowed. Sold. Stolen. Tricked. Or left. Not anymore. Is that okay?  Your two faces are no better than your one. Do you really think you're seen as anything but? Is that okay? Bitter. Jaded. Pious. You may be in denial of such, but clearly a badge for you it is. Can you deny that? Is that okay?   I will not be an outlet for ultimatums. They don't work. It will take little time for you to realize your favor they do not work out in. Is that okay?  My thoughts are mine. They are nothing and they are everything. I am neither better, nor worse. Am I too harsh? Do my words burn? Tell your story? Make you hate me? Do they hit close to home? Do they climb the very walls that surround you?   My words. My feelings. My thoughts.  They are okay .  And I am okay.  Yes, I know I'm bottled. My fuel is my silence. This won't change. However, this is my outlet. Today. And that's okay.  Ultimately, I will not be unsatisfied. I will not be told I can't, when I want to. I will not be broken because it was a goal. Your payment. Your right. My intent is to not abandon all that is familiar. To change 180 degrees. To think I am above. Intangible. I know I'm real. I know I'm flawed. And: Understood. Misunderstood. Deep. Shallow. Hypocritical. Sincere. Addicted. Honest. Happy. Sad. Hateful. Trustful. Deceitful. Alive. That's okay. Are you not, as well?  But,  you , my friend, are a window - you should know. I see inside you, and I see through you. You think you are. But you're not. You think you did. But you didn't. You think this is about you. Well, is it? You're a character. A player. You are no different from him, him or her. You entertain me. You think you can't be read. But, you can. And, you are.    And yes, that's okay too.

      The lyrics to one of my favorite songs.   Sinking In    This is a drag that it's too late now.  And I wanted to tell you that I was wrong.  I didn't realize I still hold on to you but I still do.   Was it that I turned everyone against you?  Was it that I didn't defend you?  Was it that I never had your back?  Was it that I was always trying to save you, and you never wanted me to?  Or was it that I loved you?   You don't seem to see me sinking in, do you?  You're not content in your own head are you?  You just want to kick me once again don't you? Don't you baby?   I did it again. I don't stop paying.  You don't look so good to me my friend.  Is it because of me I really left this time?  Did you ever say goodbye?   Was it that I had a crush on your friend?  Was it that I left for another man?  Was it that I didn't know that you were in over your head, and I didn't see what I had -- did I? No, I didn't.   Was it that everyone would just kiss my ass?  I couldn't see through it and you could.  And now look what's come of us here ten years later.  I jump from one to the other, you're still worrying your mother. And I almost went under baby.   You don't seem to see me sinking in, do you?

         GEMINI Things could be so easy for everyone. See what you can do about this, whether it involves an ace up your sleeve or obvious skills that everyone has but no one else is using. You'll step in and facilitate or advocate if that's what's needed. Make peace between individuals that are already so close to bridging the gap between them. Faith and energy are your driving forces. You have all the fuel you need to keep going. By the end of the day, all belligerent parties are on speaking terms. See what other miracles you can work while you're in the mood.     It should be noted that I have officially unsubscribed to this astrology guide. If this is the kind of off-center, b.s., ms. cleo-level advice I'm getting, when clearly this is not the case, could never be the case, and sure as hell has never been the case -- then I am better off asking my magic 8 ball the odds of whether or not I will self-implode by week's end on the elevator at 777 Main Street - Carter & Burgess Plaza.  His answer: Very Likely.  Happy Day, yall. My name is Dustin

      Okay, it's my first official posting to a blog. I know, I'm skeert too. I was wondering if I would even have time, then i realized I  am  at work from 8 to 5...and I've already spent like 30 minutes of my 15 minute break debating if it really is inappropriate to bring my big chief tablet and husky pencil to a corporate meeting (I came to the conclusion that it was not inappropriate at all because well...i just did it and have every intention to do it again). So, well, hell i guess time really isn't that big of an issue anyway.   As for what I'm gonna say -- hell, I'll just wing it. It seems to be my way.  So, here we go:     I think people are out to destroy me more than ever.  Granted, not all people, but people that are sent either on a mission from the devil himself ... or from the bowels of South Fort Worth. They are hell-bent on de-railing my days.   Seriously, I just finished a phone coversation with a print rep I have to deal with regularly. Let's call her "Ig'nant" -- and that conversation will now take me the next 10 years to digest. I don't think Ignant is aware of her power to stay with me longer than swallowed gum. I hate her.  And sure, I've been on edge a little more as of late. That's a given. Seriously, spin my *wheel-o-fortune* and you'll land on "deceased grandmother", "outed by ms. cleo", and "2.5 weeks without fast food." But, it seems to be getting worse -- and it's the little things that are doing it:   * It's the ironically over-weight gym-rat in spandex who is unaware of his talent of visual petrification. I don't care what his package looks like and the fact that he is sweating more by doing less work should not, and will never be, a bragging right.  * It's the corporate monkey-ass that always seems to stumble into my elevator just when i think i have it all to myself. My walls of self-inflicted social isolation will not be torn down!     * It's the lady who calls me "ma'am" on the phone. (all of yall just shut the hell up right now and keep readin').  * It's the 2 hour meeting I have scheduled this afternoon that will cause me to make every effort possible to unravel it, as well as scrape away the self-esteem of the drones who subscribe to this corporate BS. (I do it non-confrontationally and they just think I'm being funny. But, trust me, they cry in the car on the way home.)   * And it's that socially-inept, developmentally delayed, man-child and his pregnant, oily wife [who seemingly has a 16-month gestation period not unlike that of an elephant] who run the engine at the same time they pump his last $7 into his '86 Dodge Dakota.  (That just scares the hell out of me, by the way.) DON'T DO THAT! Turn the engine off! Don't ask me why...in my world, it just gets filed in the same cabinet with leaving the dryer on or babysitting 6 year olds.  Regardless, my pretty has certainly taken it's beating as of late. That's right, even my cape-cod-candy-coating can be worn down. Seriously, if these people were on the face of an etch-a-sketch, I'd shake it like mad-hell until they disappeared. Maybe I'm just crazy, and it's not their fault. Fortunately, that could never be the case.    Anyway, I'm waiting for the tide to change. A new cd to come on. It's near summertime and I want to be happy again.  Anyway, enough of that --- I won't complain for every entry. Probably. But, for this little blog-o-mine: expect nothing and expect everything. I ramble. And it's just here for you to check out if you care. And, if you don't,  that's fine. I won't be hurt. Why should I?   And feel free to post your comments, as well. And, if you decide to post something condescending, disparaging, or what you feel is "witty" (even tho none of your friends have told you that you really aren't witty) --- that is cool too. All opinions are openly accepted. I won't be mad. And when we see each other again, I ask that you not be mad when I make every effort humanly possible to invert my stomach in your presence.  That's me people. Stay posted. Aloha.

      It sits on a shelf. Out of reach. Out of view. And though not tangible, it's been pulled and stretched and wadded and worn. It's been opened and ripped and used and broken. And, it's been lost. Once.  And so it now just sits. Waits. Debates. Confused as to move closer - back to me - within my reach. My grasp. Within my light.   Or does it move further into the darkness of the corner? In the dust. In the shadows. Alone. Is that it's fate?    It  is neither singular nor plural. It is a thought. It is a hope. It is a feeling. It is a mood. It is a love. It is an appreciation and an understanding. It is an answer. It is me.   And it is missed.

       Okay, yall. This is something else from the archives. It wasn't that long ago...but, hell, it's something. Anyway...read, read, read little chil'ren. d.   This rant is brought to you by all the numbers that equal the sum total of what it would take to rob me of what's left of my already-fragile spirit. And because I do have a few minutes to kill, I figured I would purge whatever has been in my mental inbox as of late. Don't worry, I've stretched.   Okay, people: math problem (grab a pencil):  An often overly-dramatic gentleman goes to Wal-Mart on a Monday night. Let's call him Dustin. He has 6 items on his shopping list, all of which he finds without effort in a matter of 7 minutes and 32 seconds. He places all 6 items in the communicable disease-kennel of a plastic carrying basket and takes it to the "Self Checkout" line. Assumingly, a modern convenience by today's standards.  Now, there are 4 self-checkout stations, 3 of which are actually functional. No surprise. All 3 stations have a line.  Side bar: these lines are not quite as long as the lengthy lines at the 6 available non-self-serve registers with Lupe, Ashinkashay, Stupid, Incompetence, Grim Reaper, and Dot-Head at their cockpits.  Afterall, we are at Wal-Mart -- equal opportunity employer.  (Mind you, these are also the only 6 open registers of the 40 they could potentially have open.)   I carefully and calculatingly choose the line that I feel has the highest potential to get me thru the flames of hell as quickly as possible. And of course, I unknowingly opt for the slowest of the 3. Apparently the mental capactity AND hand-eye coordination necessary to undertake such an endeavor of checking one's self out is more than some people should take on....regardless if their cart has 5 or 50 items.  Now, don't get me wrong, the elderly and medically-diagnosed "challenged" people are exempt from this rant... but there is no medical diagnosis for "stupidity", yall --  and, therefore, renders them eligible for all of my rage and hostility.    So, as I waited for Cracka-Harry and the unfortunate beneficiary of his Y chromosone to scan a case of Miller Light, 12 sticks of cajun beef jerky, a lunchable, a box of velveeta (mexican flavor) and a tv guide... I tried like mad-hell to find balance and calm on the volatile teeter-totter in my head.  I can't remember feeling more  vulnerable and helpless in my entire life. I didnt want to leave because I had already committed too much time to this check-out-line-test-from-God  (and slowly going numb in the process.)  But, I digress... So, dearest friends, what do you think the mathematical probablilty that I made it out of that dungeon of evil with one ounce of my pretty remaining? Well....? That's right. None. Not a damn bit of pretty left on the whole f-in tree-o-me.   I officially hate hate hate HATE Wal-Mart -- -and  it's clientele --- and that it has unbeatable cheap prices that coerce me in going there ...   BUT... I hate even more the fact that stupid people are allowed to procreate in this world in the front seat of a '79 Burnt Orange El Camino with no regard for the rest of society. Sons of ...   I refuse to have the last bit of my cherry blow-pop be sucked off by trash. STUPID, TRASHY PEOPLE!  Okay, I'm done. Mama need a drink. She parched.  Losing my religion, My name is Dustin

      Okay, friends. I shall now give a snippet of one chapter from the novel, “8 mile goes to Hollywood – The Many Ways to Show No Class Among the High Class.” Feel free to burn some microwaveable popcorn, relax, and enjoy the details of this story.  Once upon a time there were three little queer boys who decided to eat at the Beverly Hills Hotel for lunch. Not a big deal, after all, we were on our vacation from reality. And a good one it was.   Lance, Tom and Dustin (I’m playing the Cindy to their Jan and Marcia) pulled into the valet drive of one of the most famous hotels in the country.  Keep in mind: 1. This is after we were unsuccessful in our pursuit to find a space to park on one of the streets behind the hotel. (near our all-too-familiar friends: Back Alley and Dumpster).  2. This is after we decided on a whim (and reluctantly by some) to even come to this glorified Denny’s of the Beverly Hill.  3. This is also us pulling up to the valet in a 2003 Mazda 6 (it should be noted that the “6” decal was missing on this rental car – this is what we call a “metaphor” people)  --- A classic example of the child-hood game “Which One of These Doesn’t Belong?”  Lamborghini --- Ferrari --- Mercedes --- Mazda 6 --- Bentley  Okay, here’s a hint:  YES  --- YES  --- YES --- OH, HELL NO --- YES  (Ba ba blacksheep, anyone?)  4. And, it should also be noted that the three of us look like a cross between Abercrombie & Fitch and the Goodwill Super Center located off of Pipeline Road in Hurst. A Gap-Off-The-Rack, if you will. We were un-showered. Hung the hell over. Our BACs (blood alcohol content), undoubtedly, were still near toxic levels - fueled only by Hollywood’s finest well-vodka and $9 martini’s.  So: caps, t-shirts, hooded sweatshirts, jeans, tennis shoes a plenty – appropriate attire for Friday lunch among 90210’s finest. (or rather, the exact opposite.) Clearly, we cancelled our subscription to the phrase “When in Rome…”.   So, the Valet asks if we will be joining them for lunch (as if there was any other reason for us to be there - aside from mowing the lawn, changing sheets, or bussing tables.) And of course, the answer is “Why, yes we are. Thank you.”  Then, a very uncomfortable Lance and Dustin follow a trying-really-hard-to-act comfortable Tom to the concierge.   When asked where the restaurant was (and feeling the unfortunate burden of having to invest more than a second of time to The Outsiders), the concierge told us that the hotel had two places to eat: 1. the Polo Club and 2. The coffee shop downstairs.  To no surprise, it was his contention that we try the coffee shop downstairs. And, of course, being with the two power-house “oh-no-you-didn’t-just-talk-down-to-me” kind of gals I was with – we felt a certain obligation (to all hotel guests and personel) to go where we probably weren’t welcome: The Polo Club. (please see your favorite reference source for the literary element of FORESHADOWING).  It is here where our tale officially begins its descent into the second circle of hell – right before the intersection of “what the hell?” and “b!tch, please.”  So, we make our way towards the Polo Club and see that there are a couple of people in front of us waiting to be seated by the host. No problem. Then, from behind, this Queen B!tch and her two subordinate drones get in front of us at the host’s station. She then turns around and says, “Oh! I’m just going to see how long the wait is.” Then, she grabs her broom stick and is whisked away to a cozy little table inside.  In awe, Lance and Tom look at each other, and for the ninth time in 4 minutes, my head drops to the ground. While Tom goes to bat, Lance begins to tear away the very essence of this socialite – within earshot of her cohorts, of course. “I can’t believe this. Did you just see that b!tch?”  So, it’s pretty obvious what was ahead on this episode of “When Gays Attack.” I felt the wind start to pick up, pillars of rainbow colors began to rise, and the sharp tongues were in lock position. (Oh, yeah…that’s right. My head went back down.)   So, two shakes of a much-needed raspberry martini later, and after the host tells us that there is no seating available --- and the threat of a Tom attack has graduated from Yellow to Red status ---  miraculously a table is found. And to no one’s surprise, it’s in the farthest possible corner of the restaurant. Let me amend that by saying…this is also the farthest corner OUTside the restaurant. On the patio. In the shade. At a broken table. In 50 degree weather.  You see where I’m going with this, don’t you?  Then, we asked our perky-as-a-fcuking-pink-poodle hostess if the Joan-Collins-Alexis-Carrington-wanna-be-B!tch who stole our table had a reservation. “Why, yes she did,” the hostess answers – completely losing sight of the passage in her “How To Be a Prententious, Ass-Kissing Member of the Service Industry” handbook --- where it clearly states “check your facts when being called on the hieratic seating decisions you make - especially when that Dynasty B!tch just asked 5 minutes ago if there was anything available.”  I hate discrimination. But, I hate discrimination by stupid people even more.  So, to no one’s surprise, Tom asks to sit inside. With the “you’ve got to be kidding me” expressions on the faces of the entire staff more than visible, we casually walked inside and were seated at our table. FRONT and CENTER --  So all could see. (I mean, we were so not going to steal anything – well, at least not the silver ware.)  The waiter takes our drink order. Coffee is $6 per cup, and apparently the water was free. (The rich just give and give, don’t they?) Then, the waiter takes our food order. Tom orders the Steak Tar Tare. Now, it’s only fair that I make mention that Tom’s pronunciation of Tar Tare is slightly different then well… the right pronunciation. As opposed to making it sound like “TAR-TAR”, Tom made the second “TAR” rhyme with “TERRY” – you know …like as in Terry-cloth…like the stuff only ghetto jogging suits and tube-tops for the mother-of-six crowd are made from? Ewww.  Yeah, I swear a copy of “Field and Stream” and a Tom Thumb Rewards card should have fallen out of his mouth right at that moment. We’re so uncouth. (No, offense, precious.) Anyway, Lance orders the crab cakes and it’s the $20 cheeseburger calling my name.  Looks. Stares. Gawks – oh so many. Afterall, we were right there. Up front. On display. In fact, we couldn’t have been any more on display if we’d have been surrounded by bars and had children poking us with sticks and paying no attention to the “don’t feed the trash” signs on our cage. I hate to be stared at more than anything. I want the powers of a Kharma Kamealon, so that I can blend into the background. Forever.  Okay, the food comes out. First Tom’s walk on the Mad-Cow side appears court-side for us to all appreciate the splendor that it was. Raw meat. Mmm, more please. They prepare it right there. At the table. Asking what spices he would like – and Tom (still) under the assumption that they will be cooking it – bless his heart.  YAY! Lunch is served! That would be raw hamburger meat for Ms. Deneen, 2 Silver Dollar sized crab cakes for Ms. Blann, and the BMW 7-series of Hamburgers for me… all for us to love and appreciate. (Now, I forget, who’s turn was it to say Grace?)  Two bites and Lance is totally finished with his crab cakes. Ironically, it was only 2 bites for Tom to finish his meal, as well. I on the other hand was rather content with my menu selection, and was more than okay to share my hamburger meat that was actual cooked with Tom and french fries with Lance.    All seemed to be going as well as…well, as well as it was going to. Our plates were cleared. The waiter asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu. Tom said yes, and that he and Lance needed more coffee. The waiter returns and hands Tom the menu and begins to blend the coffee for the gentlemen at the table. Thirty seconds pass and the waiter, having never left the table, is preparing to pour the coffee now. Tom abruptly says, “Actually, I’m going to need a couple of minutes” without looking at the waiter’s efforts to serve his coffee. I make mention to Tom that the waiter is pouring his coffee (and has been preparing it during this time) and I’m sure he will get his couple of minutes to look over the menu. Bless it all.   Fast forward: After the wheels had fallen off of this moving violation known as “US” – Lance tells a story of how he was once embarrassed on a casual date by a friend. Out of respect for Lance – I won’t tell the exact sentence that he said so loudly that it rattled the adjacent tables (and particularly one waiter who turned his head immediately around to our table). But, I will say that it was a homo-familiar phrase that rhymes with “He took me home and he Tucked me in the Grass”. (Find your decoder ring, I’m sure you can figure out what was actually said.)  Again, my head goes down. Then, to put the icing on this slice of disaster cake -- Lance almost spills Tom’s coffee. A scene it was…and even more so, a mess it was. We could not get out fast enough – not even if the car was already out front with the keys in the ignition ---  and not even if the doors on our little Mazda 6 were sealed shut so we all had to do was climb in thru the windows – Dukes of Hazzard style – and throw it in over drive.  So, that’s it: our lunching experience at the Beverly Hills Hotel. No cute little shot glasses to bring back. No clever little t-shirts. No precious pictures of great times that were had. And certainly no immediate plans for a reunion tour at this venue.  NOTHING.  We left with only one thing: directions back to our Ramada Inn . Losing our selves in the music, we left with only one thing: directions back to the Ramada (err…8 mile.).  Dustin  _____________________________  Now – If you've enjoyed this story (or if you didn’t -- hell I don’t really give a d*mn) – here is a list of some other topics that you can choose from to learn more about our LA trip. Either Lance, Tom, or myself will be more than happy to share a few words about your chosen selection.  1.   The parking attendant that hated Tom (Tom has a meltdown in the parking garage)  2.

      There is a storm. A wicked fury stirring within - calculating and manipulating as to when to strike next. And there is a shadow. A darkness to which I see too frequently and know way too intimately. And,lastly, there is a single drop of rain - one that would drown a thousand souls - but is set on just one. Mine.  And, yet, you don't hear me, see me, feel me. You don't know me. You  won't  know me. Am I presumptuous? So bold? Have I misjudged? Mistaken? We both know the rhetorical nature of this question. All questions. And, it's no fault of your own. I know that. I own that. That's my burden to carry. To harbor. To bear.   You were let half-way in with the naive hope you'd find your way. You didn't. You haven't. You won't. You're on your way out. The same way you came. With little to show for your efforts. struggles. Your journey. And I'm sorry. Really.  My intent wasn't to close off. Become numb. Surrender to cold. the damp. the dark. It wasn't to accept the anger. Rage. Frustration. Confusion. Dishonesty. Pain. Fear. And it wasn't to lose the passion. companionship. satisfaction. or the love.   Unintended. Yet unavoidable.    But, it's dark now, my friend. Late. Nightime. It's time for me to close my eyes and time for you to find rest. A deep breath before dreaming. Surrender to the night and prepare to embrace the coming day, letting go of the past day. Rather, the past days.   This is a broken good night to you.

      I'm kinda blah today. I'm feeling introspective (and eating animal crackers). I think this a good song to post. It's one of my all-time favorites ever. I'm not so creative today, so I'll rely on someone else's creativity instead. ;-)   You think you hear demons I think you are the demon In this place where the images are born You remember your childhood  Oh, in fiery sequences  The sun goes down Filling the air with color and winds that lift you up to God  You fall to your knees You embrace the storm You no longer care if it's cold or if it's warm You live for the danger Like your passion and your anger  You don't let go  You like to be twisted by the force  You like to be shaken by the wind In this game that you play with God You've been warned to retreat   You take it to the limit When the winds come up Crazy men, crazy women Crying out for love You like to save her But you just can't give it up  You'd rather be wrapped up In the arms of a storm Crazy men and crazy women In the storm  And the sun goes down Chasing down the demons You think you hear demons Chasing down the demons Crying out for love

       my destiny is riding again. rolling in the rain. unwinding in the wind. my destiny is fighting again. secretly unwinding what it was i was supposed to say to you today.

      this doubles as a sentiment and and a lazy effort to post  something . -- d.   Until he himself Became the deadliest poison  As he grew older.  Until he himself, Became just as fatal As was his garden.  And so you run toward What you know is wrong. There are too many flowers To cut down.  With all the love I have for your life - For the love I have for your life - Turn around.  Never did I mean to Imprison you Here in my garden Like I am imprisoned.  For all the love I have for your life -  For the love I have for your life -  Turn around.  Until he himself Understood his garden Leaving his heart broken, No future at all.  Until he himself Became the toxic garden Always frightened. No future at all.  And so you run towards What you know is wrong There are too many flowers To cut down  With all the love I have for your life With all the love I have for your life Turn around.  Never did I mean to  Imprison you  Here in my garden  Like I am imprisoned.   For all the love I have for your life - For all the love I have for your life -  Turn around.  Running through the garden,  I'm running in brilliant colors I'm running straight toward - straight toward What you know is really wrong.  Too many flowers here to cut down For the love I have for your life Turn around.  For the love I have - Turn around...
