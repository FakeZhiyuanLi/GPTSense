       "Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be."   Author:  Shel Silverstein

      I remember the first day of school when I was 5 years old. My mom put me in 1st grade in a public school in Maryland. She thought it would be advantages for me to be the youngest in my class; it was interesting to say the least, to be the youngest and not speak a word of English. I was like an alien who had woken up in a completely different world. I learned English in front of the TV watching Electric Company and Sesame Street.  So, this morning taking my kids to their first day at a new school was harder for me than them. My daughter holds my hand when she senses I’m about to get emotional about dropping her off in her new 2nd grade class. Whoever first realized children were wiser than adults must have been a very observant person.  Yesterday, at work, I spoke with a mother who lost her son to a drunk driver this past weekend. I could barely speak listening to her cry. I think the best thing children can teach you is how to love something more than yourself and although there is a huge fear element involved with that, you never regret them.

      Now that the "k" is in place Where the "c" used to be It seems that I'm ceasing to be In a season of the old me I wouldn't trade my place I got no reason to be Weathered and withering Like in the season of the old me Bust the lock off the front door Once you're outside you won't want to hide anymore Light the light on the front porch Once it's on you're never wanna turn it off anymore And now it's on Now it's on Now that the lake's in place Where the dead sea used to be It seems that I'm ceasing to be In the season of the old me I wouldn't trade my place I got no reason to be Weathered and Withering Like in a season of the old me Bust the lock off the front door Once you're outside you won't want to hide anymore Light the light on the front porch Once it's on you're never wanna turn it off anymore And now it's on And now it's on And now it's on And now it's on Now it's on Now it's on

      Is something I can never seem to get enough of....I don't know what I would do without coffee in the morning. Lately, I have been really feeling the travel bug. I was up late last night trying to find the cheapest airfare to a million destinations all over the world. There are really good deals to Fiji right now, in case you want to take advantage of that. I am European in the sense that I also feel summer is the perfect time for a month long vacation. When I was in Europe one summer, it was great to see an entire city go on vacation....the slowing down in the atmosphere was palpable. I enjoy slowing down and I think we need to do more of it. Sometimes, I really think about becoming a teacher so that I can travel. I never learned so much about others or myself as when I went to Europe for six months. It's good to be out of your familiar element....being in the moment is the only way to be when you find yourself surrounded by a completely different place.

      I think in part its the hunt of thriftin' that I love but more than anything its like going back in time. My friend and I found a crepe dress that was made in the depression era...amazing that women were making dresses out of paper! We spent about 3 hours this Saturday digging through old things that I'd love to buy or wish I could fit....how is it that all the women back then had 20 inch waists? Even the men were tall and lanky....  I keep trying to think of a way to incorporate things I enjoy into an actual career…all while being creative. I had dinner last night with my longest friend and we talked about our reservations and confusion about what we should be doing with our lives—we came to the conclusion that most of us know what we want to do and where our interests lie but that it's more about being willing to take the risk it involves. What if we find out we can do our dream…then what? That’s a responsibility-- being aware of ones own power and abilities….how do you cop out then?? Another thing we talked about is how we assume we have to know exactly what we want when more than likely it’s a matter of degrees-- by that I mean we can try a lot of different things in the same field of interest. Eventually, one will supercede the others and ring true for us….its dangerous to limit ourselves to having to know the one thing we are suppose to do…we have to be wiling to try a smorgasbord of life. By the time dinner was over I think two of my sweet friends are thinking about going back to school to help figure it out….I have no doubt they will learn a lot about themselves.

      I can't think of a better place to live....on days like today....we have the bluest widest skies of any country I have ever been to.  The quote for today:    "Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood."    Oscar Wilde     Well said.

      "The proof of the little prince's existence is that he was delightful, that he laughed and that he wanted a sheep. When someone wants a sheep, that proves he exists," they shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child! But if you tell them, "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they'll be convinced, and they won't bother you with their questions. That's the way they are. You must not hold it against them. Children should be very understanding of grown-ups. But of course, those of us who understand life couldn't care less about numbers! I should have liked to begin this story like a fairy tale. I should have liked to say: Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet hardly bigger than he was, and who needed a friend..." For those who understand life, that would sound much truer."  There is a great yogi from India named Yogananda and according to him he says that most children are stripped of their innocence and deluded by life by the age of 7. Yesterday, was a day for me that illustrated the wonderment of children in the world. I heard in detail from my two kids the story of how they found a baby squirrell in the backyard. I had to stop myself from wondering about the details of the squirells fall and the worry that it had rabies and allow myself to slip into the world of how it had tears and cried like an actual baby. My kids are older than 7 yet they still manage to find the magic in all of the small things around them. I hope that is a trait they will carry throughout their life.  I went to bed having the quote above read to me and I thought it was an interesting coincidence and clear what my lesson for the day had been.... and how it had come full circle.

      Went for a walk today during lunch...it was hot and the cement was radiating heat up my legs. I remembered today how when I was a kid I was fascinated by the idea of frying an egg on the pavement. I had heard through other kids in the know that in Texas it was hot enough to do so. We spent one summer in Austin when I was 9 trying to do this very thing. Cute how when you are a kid doubt hardly ever creeps into your mind. I don't remember ever frying the egg but we sure had a blast trying.

      I guess I am a hopeless romantic always destined to be disappointed in the constant disconnect between what I idealize love to be and the reality of what it is...at least this is my experience thus far. I see so many women hurting themselves by living in this type of turmoil. I wonder sometimes is love suppose to be this difficult and if so why???  I have this cherished book called "Love Letters", it is filled with copies of authentic letters between lovers ...sometimes long correspondences of some famous couples. I love to pull it out and read them. I realize people don't write letters anymore but I guarantee you that I was one of those lovers in a past life writing back and forth to someone with a passion that hurt.  Someday I know I'll get a letter. I've always know since I was little that I would find that...but its something I won't compromise about--at least not anymore. If the past has taught me anything it's that.

      Well, here I am in the world of blog. I guess I better find something to talk about. I plan on ranting and raving just basically being my nutty self. One thing for sure is that I am beginning to embrace my inner geek and I'm feeling good about that.  I guess with all the challenges I've been through in the last two years I've gotten to know myself better and hence know that I have something to share. I'm not worried on what scale though.  So last night in class we watched this really cool Bill Moyer's video...his show NOW looks awesome...I need to set it on my DVR. (BTW DVR's rule) So anyways there was this guy on a "Futurist" it was so interesting....everything having to do with the future and the implications on our society ethically interests me. He talked about everything from cloning to the culture of brand loyalty. It's amazing that people are able to create such niche jobs for themselves. It's inspiring really. Next, Bill interviewd a philosopher and they discussed the aspect of evil and what it means....whoa..it blew my mind. I need to buy her book and do a book report on it for my blog. She did say one thing which struck a cord...Bill asked her if we were a moral society...it stumped her it seemed and she said in degrees we are and that we tend to forget that we make or create our own realities. So often I forget this I guess....I wait for life to happen to me and forget I have the power to make things happen. That's a huge freakin' deal!  So today I decided I would do some research on futurists and I found this association and wrote for their help in starting a group at St.Ed's. I'm excited...I hope it works out.  Maybe it's the times we live in right now but I'm really pumped lately to make changes and to be a part of positive changes in this country. I believe in the ripple effect so why the hell not ya know. I figure all I have to lose is this way of life...so I'm going for it. Kerry may not be perfect but I want to say I tried to get Bush out...it's just too much all this stuff I read about everyday with the war. It's enough to make you feel hopeless..apathetic. I have to fight those feelings.  I'm too happy a person lately to let anything weigh me down though.
