      I cannot believe that I am having so many dreams!  Last night I had one about my former best buddy, Drew. He and I had a breif relationship, but realized that we were better friends than anything and continued on as such. It's been almost 10 years now, that we've been friends and now it's been probably 1 1/2 years that I've spoke with him due to a woman with a tight leash. I really wonder how people are controlled so easily. I couldn't handle that mysself. Well, this dream was me confronting him on how he said that we would always be friends and that if a woman couldn't handle Cindy, than she didn't need to handle Drew. I was sad in my dream, I miss him while awake as well, We spent a lot of time listening to each other's problems and triumphs, to have it all end because of a relationship is not only sad, but typical. :( I miss my friend.

      I had a dream last night that I had another baby. Weird thing is that I am fixed to not have babies anymore and have been for almost 5 years. The baby was born in the bathtub and I dropped her in the bathtub because I had no help having her. She was still okay and beautiful. I wonder why I am having birthing dreams? I think I will go look it up!

      The teacher is so freaking anal retentive. No kindess, no loveliness. Just icky icky icky. She told me a way to format my answers, and I've done it just as she has said. Even wrote a sticky note and put it on my computer screen to remind me and she still says she's wrong! Fucking bitch is driving me crazy!!!!!!!AAAAAAAAHHH! Only 2 1/2 more weeks of her crap.

      8 guests, 6 of them buying guests and the party totaled around 400 bucks. Not too bad for a first party. The next should be somewhat bigger. She knows of 10 girls for sure and is still inviting away. Can't wait! The other business, the candle one is not doing so well. Oh well, you can't win them all.

      I can guarantee I'm going to be tipsy. I'm nervous about what to say about these products and don't have a lot of time to study them!

      My Arouse the Passion business is doing wonderful!  It's amazing how many women want to get out an spice up their love lifes!  I have booked parties all the way through August already, I'm so excited. And nervous. It's just scarey to me to stand up in front of people and talk about sex aids. LOL

      I just started another business! This one cost very little to start and you get A LOT from it. I am excited.  You join a monthly candle club, They give you a One triple-scented 16 oz. Mia Bella "Cleaner Burning" Soy/Veg candle *	A box of one dozen scented "Cleaner-Burning" votive Soy/Veg candles  *	One Soysational Bella Bar (Natural Soap Alternative) , They also give you a web-site that if people sign up for the same monthly club, you get residual income off of them. 10% income off of your first level and 5% thereafter. I thought it was a great idea, because eventually your candles get paid for! Then you make money too. So I did this. Check it out if you are interested, it's very little start up, just the money for the monthly deal and you are set to sign people up under you.  urlLink  Scent Sations

      GRRRR. I bought a new printer back in March that is compatible with my mac and it was refurbished on ebay. NO warranty! =( Well, it's not working now and I need a new one. I just have to bite the bullet and buy a good one so I'm not spending 100 bucks per year to replace them. I've gone through more printers than anyone I know! Here goes another 300 bucks out the door...

      That would be a bunch of women.  I am having an adult toy party in two weeks and have all these women saying they want to go. Little by little you start hearing, "I don't want to come if so and so is going to be there" GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR How many people do we have in this world who we don't like or don't like us? There is this girl at Phil's work that tried to get him to go out with her when I was living with him and jusst had had his baby. She even came to the hospital to check me out. But do I not go to a mutual friends house for her baby shower because Jennifer Fucking Grey will be there? No- I'm not making my friend suffer more because she harbors a bitch as a friend. But here goes my party and I start hearing it. I'll probably end up with noone there because of this and make no money. crap

      I hate being a begger for money. People are asshole's to you because they think they can be because you need their tip. I'm going to try to get something else. Hopefully more money.. Also- Found out I need glasses. Not all the time, just when reading and on the computer! I picked the cheapest lenses I could find and they were still 135 bucks and 220 total out of pocket after you get the prescription and tint and whatnot out of the way! ACK! Like I needed more expenses.

      Life freaking sucks these days. I am having such a hard time with bills. I wasn't working for 6 months and we fell far behind and now catching up seems impossible! I'm so scared we're going to start losing our belongings, house, car etc. I need another job and noone is hiring yet. I went all the way through to a DM interview at Anchor Blue and they called to say they selected the other candidate. What can I say other than oh fucking well! My job I have now says that they will try to give me more shifts, but their bar manager is also a bartender there and gets the primo shifts. SO I have no idea what to do , I'm trying...

      I guess we're being blessed somehow. I was worried about two bills especially. I got the mortgage taken  care of on a repayment plan. Got the Cougar taken care of on a deferment, so the next was the fourrunner and the equity loan. I called the fourrunner people before the end of July and asked if they could help us out with it. It's been 4 out of 5 years on this loan and we never had trouble before with them. So they said they would call me back. By and by they didn't, I called them. They said it wasn't settled yet. So finally I called yesterday and she said they had LOST the file! I said they should just sign the title over then. LOL They said it doensn't work that way. =) Oh well. But, they deferred the payment(s) and we only owe one this month. Geez we are so behind. But this stuff helps really. The deferrements are life savers at times. So that bill is taken care of and Phil's fourrunner is safe from being taken away. *whew* Next we have to deal with the Equity loan. And them, we'll just have to pay back. They don't defer, so still stressed about that, I went to my ONLY shift at work this week. PLUS I had my ONE party postpone from this week as well. So NO money nights for me this week. I went to work and it was DEAD DEAD DEAD. My boss called ME the kiss of death! Damn I want to quit that place. They made me buy new shirts beccause you could barely see my pits on the other one's. So I'm thinking that I am not making the money to even cover the shirts I had to buy and when I got to counting the money at the end of the night, I had made 85 bucks. There is no way that is all mine. I don't know what happened unless when they counted my bank they were off.  I usually count it first but didn't because I was slacking. So now I have the money to cover my school books for the class that starts next week. =) Sometimes it all works out.....

      I used to love bartending, it sucks that I don't like it anymore. =( It also hurts my carpal tunnal.   Hopefully my business will take off, allowing me to do a few other business things I want to do but take more money and then Ican quit my job and be home with mydaughter. That is my goal. By the time she starts kindergarten to not have to work SO much, just enough while she is in school and then be able to pick her up and take her to piano, gymnastics, etc.

      I'm on fast track already. I'm so excited. I did a party on Friday night and did 1K!!! And booked two parties while there. I also may have a new consultant. I'm so excited. I can't believe I'm doing so well and it's not even been a month. Amazing. August is my first "official" month and for fast track  you only have to do 1K in sales and I did that with one party. So next is to have fast track for month two and three. Which is the same in sales, but month three is to sponsor and qualify two consultants. If I get the one, than maybe I will have one more and I will get fast track 3!
