Besides the huge work load, i guess learned that i can't do everything on my own and i needa pray more and rely more on God. I think i drifted a lot this year but in teh same time grew as well. Drifted as in not constant wit quiet times and stuff but i learned a lot about God, and his power. And how he's in control of everythign.   HIGHLIGHTS of the year: CSM, BPA and Kids way definitely, hanging out after school and meeting a lot of knew ppl and getting to know a lot more ppl better this year. Uh.. helpin Steph wit her guy problems ;) haha dat was funni, alex and his bird hunting.. haha thougth that would nvr end, late nite calls wit Ashley dang dat was killer haha sleepign at lyk 4 haha, riding the Metro!! haha dat was fun, finals studying and avoiding ppl lol trying to run from Ahmed haha, err well not much more. i'll prolly think of more later  person i guess impacted my life most, have to be Steph Got to know ehr sooo much better this year through Kid's Way and BPA, and she's just always so.. happy and joyful haha yea she mite freak out and spaz at times, but nvr seen anyone more happy then her. And she's always really open wit me in doing self assessments about her self and i guess in doing so, she's lead me to think about how i'm leading my life in Christ, and helps me in reflecting on myself since i don't do that often.. hehe and I can always count on her to liven up the crowd haha since she's always the loudest one and she's really a very.. complicated person haha. She nvr ceases to amaze me with her jokes and pick up lines lol some i don't get till she does it lyk.. 5 times.. haha not sure if i'm just slow, or her pick up lines are that ineffective lol she's just a super cool person and really blessed to have a frnd lyk her

       Wow.. Impact was soo amazing.. speaker was Geoff Sanfford, i think he was from minnesota, but yea he just concentrated on talkign about Humility, Integrity, Couage, Generosity, Gratitude, and Love. And they all just hit the spot in my lives. How our character is constantly being assaulted by Satan and that we need to live lives of Humility, Integirty and Courage so that God will lift us up in honor. It was really just life changing. So i was in Erase family!! WHOO HOOO go earsers! "Andale Andale mama ERASE ERASE UHOH!!" haha that was our cheer, got it from Nelly's EI. Yeah&nbsp;so got Andy Lee and Patty Eng as my mommy and daddy! haha That was just too cool, Andy being my D-group leader, and Patty my CSM counselor. My roommate was Jonathan Tao from WHCC, he was just the awesomest guy man, he was always so Godly and so just on track. He even reminded me about prayer partners. wow.. i'm so lucky to have had him as my prayer partner/roomate. oh! and the first day, while i was playing basketball, i played this whole game with a guy i didn't know, and yea afterwards, he was like "are you Joyce's cuz?" and Joyce being my cuz that i havn't seen in like forever, i didn't know he was talking about that Joyce, thought it was the one from church, so i was like uh.. no? lol and then he was like you sure? i'm John arn't you David and you have a lil brother Timothy, and i was like OH! yea yea yea adn turns out that guy was like my cuz from which i lyk played wit b/w ages 1-5 b4 i moved away. It was sooo awesome seeing him again, but yea.. embarassing i forgot him lol. and it turned out he was in my family too!! so that was cool, we got to catch up on some old times and hang out. ahhh but he broke his clavical at camp while playing bball, yea he's kinda skinny and playign wit those built guies.. dangerous.. and Andy sprained his ankle when he got a rebound and came down on Linda.. lol man our famiy got the most injuries award. The workshops were pretty cool, my first one was the Dating one with Jason. And he just talked about the 3 aspects of a relationships being with emotion, spiritual, and physical. And how the emotional and spiritual need to lead to the physical in a relationship if it's going to work. And how our relationships whethere in high school or in college shoudl be beneficial in our walk with Christ. They shoudl be our running partner in teh race that's around us. Life being a race, and we're all headed toward teh finish line, shouldn't be looking for someone that's still on the bleachres and hasn't started the race (nonbelievers) or someone that's sitting down or still at the beginnign of the race. Best is someone who's aorund you or even in spirituality etc. So yea.. my perspective now on dating nonchristians.. it's not wrong.. just it wouldn't be benenficial, and would never work out. And also the point of dating should be to look for our future spouse, so shouldnt' be dating just for the sake of it. er... Next worksshop was the quiet times with Danny, that was pretty cool but he talked soo much kinda forgot/lost track. But basically Quiet Times are important in that they let us go against what Satan wants, and it should be hard because it's against our norm of sinning and saying NO to God. Like dribblign a bball, if ur used to using right hand, then when switchign to left hand, takes more concentration and practice for you to be good at it, so queit times take practice as well, and going to attempt to be consisitent. Also he also talked about writing in Journals, and that when you write about how u feel, it lets you see from an outside perspective on who you really are, so i might start doing that.. if i dont' get lazy lol and the last workshop.. i was suppose to go to Honor and Obey, but everyone said it was boring as heck.. so went to Andy's workshop Civilization haha yea.. i know its wrong.. but Andy's was actlaly pretty interesting. It was&nbsp; like a debate where the civilians and president debating whether or not&nbsp; we'r going to go to War. And both sides presented secular and christian reasons, pretty cool but in teh end, haha there wasn't suppose to be a winner, but i sitll say we won.. civilians! lol so that was pretty fun, and yea there was a lot of bball playing, stefan and I beat the josh's!! oh yea! 15-8 it hink.. haha they really didn't expect that.. ah well it was prolly luck cuz i was making all my shots lol. So yea camp was awesome!! post camp rally Friday, July 30th 7:30! ok well dats it for now.. gotta go to Drivers ed.

The video was hilarious with teh 4 middle school counselors, and got to see some ppl again like John and steph which was cool, and met new ppl but i yea forgot their names.. haha steph who was teh girl i was sitting next to? she was nice haha but yea.. fbcc is.. err well the facility is pretty nice but audio, was kinda poor they need James haha but overall i think its awesome place. But yea basically went so Daniel woudlnt' feel odd, but haha i didn't even sit next to him which kinda defeated the prupsoe, and someone who was suppose to make him feel, ionno at least interested kinda ignored him teh whole time.. *cough* steph u could've at least talked to him a lil, he looked lyk he was bored outta his mind.. lol but its aite.. hmm.. well yea after post camp went to Josh's house and just hung out there for a while. Leading again Sunday, please pray for me, it's all in God's hands thanks.

Saw all the people and they played a game. Pretty amazing haha and bought a t-shirt also. Then Friday was the pre-camp rally. Yes! patterson goign to Impact! It's gonna be sooo awesome can't wait! yea we talked about the misconceptions of going to camp lyk it being a place where u meet ur spouse, camp's goign to be awesome!, or this year is gonna be beter this last year. Camp being awesome meaning that we needa prepare our hearts for camp and to go there adn really try to seek God. Then watched video by Daniel Lin which was hilarious lol  Saturday went to Josh's house for worship team practice. Daniel, and Jesse were there to. Amazingly we had a producting almost 2 hr practice haha first time ever. Yea eveyrthing went pretty smoothly, Josh with his awesome new guitar sigh.. so nice i want one of those.. but yea.. and after Josh, Esther, Jesse and I went to first colony for some lunch and then to the movies where we watched Spiderman 2. It was alrite, but ending was pretty.. ionno cheesy.. haha yea.. then we just went back to Josh's hosue, they're NEW house haha don't think i mentioned earlier but they moved to sweetwater.. he's going to clements and so is esther.. sucks.. and they prolly end up going to FBCC.. double sucky.. ah well guess its all part of God's plan. sigh..   Sunday worship went alrite, went to Josh's house again rite after to help them prepare for July 4th party. haha interesting time, first me and esther helped err fix this cabinet thing, lyk replace the handles.. haha... yea.. and then just watched her clean her room... fun. haha but then josh came and we played sequence for lyk.. 2 hrs. yea.. getting annoyed by that game. But then ppl started coming. We played a lil of ESPN basketball then went out to swim. Then played some real basketball which was fun, but barefoot hurts! haha i had callouses already though.. so it was alrite. Then ate and watched Peter Oh give a speech on his vision and future at Intervaristy and in help making christians and leaders of teh students at A&M. So gotta pray for him. err.. yea then not much after, just chilled and yea. Awesome time.
