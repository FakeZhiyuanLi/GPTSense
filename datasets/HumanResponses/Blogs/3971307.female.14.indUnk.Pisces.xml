        Hmm....last week&nbsp;I was at tiffs house for like the whole week.&nbsp;On tuesday me and Tiff went over to whitleys house for a pool party which was fun but the water was freeezing. Then we went back to tiffs house and jumped on the trampoline w/ raquel, her forgien exchange student&nbsp;for like an hour, haha.That night like 20 people came over and we all went out for ice cream...in a camper.&nbsp;lol yeaa...everybody wouldnt fit in the van. ha. The next day&nbsp;we woke up and went to Tullys w/ some people. lmao we rode home w/ dave and mariana and tiff was like screaming   every song that came on the radio hahha that was hilarious! The next day we practically did nothing and then the next day i went home. On friday my little sis came over. She is so cute but really annoying. I only get to see her like 1-2 times a month so yeah i was kinda happy :-).&nbsp;On saturday my grandpa and grandma came down from Vermont to&nbsp;visit and next month i am going to vermont and stay w/ them.&nbsp; i am so excited cause i get to go kayaking.yayy! Yesterday i was watching this weird show called the 4400. yeah, it was about these people who got abductedby aliens and then they came back to earth.
