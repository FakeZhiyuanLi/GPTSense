      alright this is part of my Random Agenda as inspired by a random blog site i visited the other day...too bad it was so random i don't remember it.  I am a Media Buyer for an online media agency and just started to work with a great account called  urlLink Indolink Inc  and  urlLink Planet Bollywood  pak power all the way!  Some of the most intelligent people i've ever met...  Anyone catch  urlLink Last Action Superstar?  Who was that chick that climbed up on the table to eat a flower to prove her point?  I think she is out of her freekin GOURD!  Reality at its best - no doubt.  What about  urlLink Last Comic Standing?  Ant is like Richard Simmons without the hair but the same shorts underneath...crying after he made what's his name look like a pitiful big black man...  Enough of this ...back to reality

      Top Doc Backs Picking Your Nose And Eating It  Picking your nose and eating it is one of the best ways to stay healthy, according to a top Austrian doctor.  Innsbruck-based lung specialist Prof Dr Friedrich Bischinger said people who pick their noses with their fingers were healthy, happier and probably better in tune with their bodies.  He says society should adopt a new approach to nose-picking and encourage children to take it up.  Dr Bischinger said: "With the finger you can get to places you just can't reach with a handkerchief, keeping your nose far cleaner.  "And eating the dry remains of what you pull out is a great way of strengthening the body's immune system.   "Medically it makes great sense and is a perfectly natural thing to do. In terms of the immune system the nose is a filter in which a great deal of bacteria are collected, and when this mixture arrives in the intestines it works just like a medicine.   "Modern medicine is constantly trying to do the same thing through far more complicated methods, people who pick their nose and eat it get a natural boost to their immune system for free. "  He pointed out that children happily pick their noses, yet by the time they have become adults they have stopped under pressure from a society that has branded it disgusting and anti social.  He said: "I would recommend a new approach where children are encouraged to pick their nose. It is a completely natural response and medically a good idea as well."  And he pointed out that if anyone was really worried about what their neighbour was thinking, they could still enjoy picking their nose in private if they still wanted to get the benefits it offered.  see more breaking news on  urlLink Dave's Daily

      Met a New Guy   urlLink Uncle Ralph ,  I have a boyfriend that I've had for about a year now, everything is ok, bad at times but alright.I'm only 19 years old and I want to move on. I've been talking to a guy for the past 3 months, now I haven't done anything with him or anything cuz I wouldn't do that, but I like him alot and he likes me too.It's just hard cuz I'm still with my boyfriend and I don't want to just end things out of the blue, because that wouldn't be right. I don't know what to do can you PLEASE help me??!!   Stephanie    Dear Stephanie,  So, you wanna suck face with a new guy.   It happens.   Boy meets girl, boy and girl swap spit for a year, girl meets new boy, desperately wants to swap spit with him but feels guilty because she already swapped spit with the first boy, first boy figures something is up, meets new girl, swaps spit with new girl and has no guilt.  Happens everyday, in every Trailer Park.  Things move on.   At 19 they’ll move on a lot.   Until you get yourself married there ain’t no point in feeling bad.  You say things have been bad at times.   If things have been bad and are just “ok” now, get over it.   You shouldn’t be having bad times in the first year of dating.  Just tell the dude that you’re done for now and move on.   Of course he’ll be upset.  Tough.   He’ll find another.   P.S.  You could help ease the blow if you buy him a couple of cases of Buckhorn or PBR.

      So here is the scoop on traditions.  I come from a very dynamic background to say the least.  I am vietnamese but was raised to be amongst an elite group of caucasians.  The cultural divide was agaped in my case since i have no heavy accent, no asian clicks that i hung out with and basically i really didn't like my own people.  I was put in that environment and now 10 years later I am faced with a dilemma.  I have engaged myself willingly and with all my heart to a young beautiful caucasian women and we have since experienced probably the most stressful merger of traditions.  Before i delve deep into the traditional factors that trodden beneath the dynamics that overlay our interracial relationship.  I must give proper respect to my parents.  Thanks for making my life a living hell by divorcing.  Thanks for taking me into a country that is a true melting pot of cultures and making me the only person that is melting in this living hell i call my daily life.  The kind of hell that makes you want to skin yourself only to show your bloody muscle tissue overlapping your skeleton.  Yeah...its like that...   Welcome to a day in my life...tune in for my daily thanksgivings and alms as I scrape to find salvation in a war torn camp i call my soul.  shout out to my boy   urlLink Josh in SD

      Sneeking a quick blog in between the monday email schedule.  Father's day was a great day.  Seeing  Michelle  smile and the twinkle in her eye as she gives the affirmation that just the 3 of us is all she needs.  My friend Ed Lavin wants to know if I'd be interested in  urlLink clearing up my intestines ?  Hmm...Its more than what I plan on investing on at the moment but if any of you out there need to get your network marketing fix - you should check out this program.  Las Brisas in Laguna was pretty good yesterday, Logan sat with me and we watched his little einstein dvds...good stuff...

      1.The Rules of Bedroom Golf: Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally one club and two balls.  2.Play on course must be approved by the owner of the hole.  3.Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.  4.For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.  5.Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole.  6.Object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the owner is satisfied play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play again.  7.It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival. Experienced players will normally take time to admire the entire course, paying special attention to well formed mounds and bunkers.  8.Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners have been known to damage a players equipment for this reason.  9.Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear, just in case.  10.Players should not assume that the course is in shape to play at all times. Players may be embarrassed if they find the course temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case.  11.Players should assume their match has been properly scheduled particularly when playing a new course for the 1st time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else is playing what they considered a private course.  12.The owner of the course is responsible for the pruning of any bushes, which may reduce the visibility of the hole.  13.Players are strongly advised to get the owners permission before attempting to play the backside.  14.Slow play is encouraged, however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace at the owners request.  15.It is considered an outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.  happy fourth all!
