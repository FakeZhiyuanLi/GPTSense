          betong  and i have been fondly calling each other big little brother and little big sister, respectively. i have a younger brother who's in the same age as  betong  but my biological brother and i are not really that close. makes me think what happened since we have always been close when we were younger. guess we've just grown apart. same thing with kuya. but i know that my brothers care for me in the same way that i care for them. it just doesn't show, i guess. oh, well. anyhow, back to  betong  who i now call shoti, i realized how constant this person is (shoti, by the way, is the chinese term for younger brother). he has always been there for me even if it's just in the confines of cyberspace. he's in another time zone but it does not make much difference though. we get to chat once in a while, talk over the phone. we get to text, as well. it's not something we do religiously but it keeps the bond stronger, somehow. he'll be coming over in a few months and i told him i'm more excited to see him than someone else. funny but it seems that the brothers that i have (whether he's my cyberspace brother or otherwise), are more significant than those that one considers a  significant  other.

        i have been in control of my life for a long time that i forgot that it is He who should do the steering.  thank you Lord for the disturbance. i was reluctant at first but i know, You will never interrupt the seeming serenity of my life had You no plans of making me better.  --------      When we are too well-pleased with ourselves; Disturb us, O Lord  When our dreams have come true because we dreamed too little; Disturb us, O Lord  When we have arrived in safety because we sailed too close to the shore; Disturb us, O Lord  Disturb us, O Lord When with the abundance of things we possess, we have lost thirst for the water of life; When, having fallen in love with time, we have ceased to dream of eternity; and when our efforts to build the new earth have allowed our vision for a new heaven to grow dim.  Stir us, O Lord to dare more boldly, to venture on wider seas, where storms shall show thy mastery, where losing sight of land, we shall find the stars.  In the name of Him who pushed back the horizons of our hopes and invited the brave to follow Him.  AMEN

        i've been staring at the screen for quite a while now, trying to come up with strings of words that would somehow embody my thoughts on cheating. such an attempt to speak my mind on something as delicate as cheating has been provoked by a text sent to me by a friend fresh from a breakup. according to her when when women cheat,  it's not always because they don't love their partners. sometimes it is because they don't feel loved.  i don't know if i'm being too overbearing if i say that my friend's notion of cheating is premised on feelings. that is, she gave in, she cheated on someone she knows she loves at that time, because she feels that she is not loved the way she wanted to be loved. was she wrong?  i wouldn't even bother answering that now.   i believe that cheating is a choice, in the very same way that love is. it may be as spontaneous as giving in to the temptation within a matter or seconds or it may be as deliberate as actually contemplating on it for years, but it still is cheating. one cannot say that he/she cheated because he/she was overwhelmed and was caught up in the moment. there is, and always is, the element of choice. for it is choice that makes us human, capable of cheating albeit capable of real loving, too...  i remember earlier posing a question on whether a cheat once will always be a cheat. i myself have always been an advocate of the  once-a-cheat-always-a-cheat movement.  i never thought my stand would take a 360-degree turn when someone i trusted so much cheated on me. but amidst the anger, i realized that then again, there is choosing and freewill working within the confines of our lives.      cheating, whether in exams or in relationships, is not healthy. and someone who has cheated once is capable of not cheating ever again, in the same manner that he/she is capable of cheating once more or even incessantly. i guess it all boils down to choice - a person who has cheated once can opt not to cheat again or he can choose to do otherwise.    i guess i'm already babbling. in which case, i'd rather end this with another prayer:         "Nothing is more practical than finding God,      that is, that falling in love in a quite absolute,final way.     What you are in love with,     what seizes your imagination,     will affect everything.     It will decide what will get you      out of bed in the morning,     what you will do with your evenings,     how you spend your weekends,     what you read,     what you know that breaks your heart,     and what amazes you with joy and gratitude.     Fall in love, stay in love,and it will decide everything."        - A prayer by Fr. Pedro Arrupe, SJ
