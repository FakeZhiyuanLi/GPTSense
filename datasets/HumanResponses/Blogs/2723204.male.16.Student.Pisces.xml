       I was walking in a field one day and found a watch, and it was not those Japanese mass-produced watches, it was one of the Swiss made timepieces with fine cranks and gears turning, the smallest piece, my fingertips can barely contain. And i was thinking, who in this Earth can make such a watch? So fine and exquisite. Soon, i walked away but heard the footsteps of two men. I hid in the bushes to watch. One said, "hmmm, this is a fine watch, and i want to make one for myself, so I'll dissect it, examine and make an exact copy of it." The other said, "I'm gonna find the guy who made this watch, and ask him to make an exact copy of it.". As they went their separate ways, i was thinking, "why not ask the guy who made this watch, ask thim to teach me, then i'll make as many watches as I want."     the afore mentioned watch analogy is really a philosophical cliche, but i've added some stuff which actually shows the divide in religion and science and have added my own stance to it. Alright, alright, before you thought that I was talking crap. I shall make this Analogy clear in the context of God. The watch is the Earth, the secrets of nature and the exploitation (both good and bad) of its resources. The main character, is me. And that guy who wanted to make a watch himself by simply examining the watch are the scientists and the guy who wanted to find the watch-maker are the religious. And obviously, in case you're a pretty dense idiot, the watch-maker is God.  Obviously, there has been a divide between religious and scientific circles. And my advice to Both sides, is to stop your pride, stop sticking your nose up in the air, stop being that arrogant prick, and start working with each other, in short stop being total asses. I'll expand on my analogy tomorrow, this is basically an intro. Anyway, i'm just sleepy if not i'll write more stuff.

      Hmmmm............so, i've gotten a new musical direction lately, may not be entirely musically influenced, but really a change in mood.........cos' the both of us is (wei qing er fan.....为情而烦)............hmmm but now its 10:20 at night and i've still got tons of homework to catch up on..........so i'm gonna sleep later. Got physics tuition on saturday.........sian..........but nvm, later i'm gonna lao yu sheng........hmm, i've got no time to rant about God, so maybe on Saturday night...........  But about Eason chan..........hmmm, imo, he writes the ONE of the best love songs, (by definition of best that is....). American pop love songs are just too superficial and lacking in depth, even though, when i first listened to ji mo rang ni gen kuai le, it really struck me as simple, pop, stuff. Esp. in the song structure and melody, cos' i'm more used to the opeth, beethoven, kinda complicated song structure and writing style. But his lyrics are really quite good, and really reflects what i feel, apart from being catchy, he's really a good songwriter anyway.  But anyway, got tons of test next week, so gotta study, good thing for Hari Raya Haji though, hope that every terrorist who attack those blessed pilgrims who give me one more day to study get impaled alive on a pole, and hopefully that'll shut them up about their "DEATH TO THE AMERICAN SATAN!!!!!!!" BS........lol, btw, the above paragraph is just a product of a bored and stressed mind, so do not really take much notice..........  So today...........good thing (a bad thing hopefully..) for you all, u all dun get to see me rant, but like I said, i'll do it on saturday........so you CAN't escape from that, this blog, is first and foremost, a ranting space.......

      STRESS! that's why my blog have not been updated that much lately. Its 12 MN now, just had my afternoon nap, so.........lol, got tons of homework to catch up on. I'm in a mood for love lately, so expect any crap poem again..........lol.........anyway, i've been thinking about God lately, cos' i've been reading about Nietschze and his arguments, but i'm a theist by nature, and of course, i disagree mostly with his stuff. I'll also come up with some stuff regarding that, (its seriously your bad luck to have me rambling about philosophy lol........). I'm also really getting into pink floyd lately, and many of the classic prog stuff, such as Yes and the like.............but hmmm, since i wanna do so much stuff, i'll start with the poem first...........  The Sapling   Over the window, a sky so dark, For it is night, what surprise is it to see darkness so stark? The moon, its gone, weeping in silence For the moon and my heart, is there really any difference? For I conceal my sorrow, a pretender I may be. But pining for her love, how indifferent is she.  Beteayed by her silence, i've got only myself to blame. For I thought it was love, when it first came. For love is a seed, tiny and small. But mine has yet to take root, will it ever fall? For my sapling of love she tramples, ,Unknowingly, my feelings she crush. For how can this sapling be compared to the tree? A tall oak tree, mighty and strong,And there she finds rest, ever so free.  Her love expressed in song, but its contents only he can comprehend. For I am, but, a sapling, foolish and small. For love is my food, and affection is my sustenance. How I long for the confession of your love, mentioned in utterance. And may you coil around my branches, for today, and forever.

      Yeah, 2nd day of CNY and I'm still here staring in front of this computer screen. I replied to almost every thread in UG (www.ultimate-guitar.com) , and now, i'm basically collecting dust. I'm listening to Bleak by Opeth, they're a great band, very very creative. In case you don't know after reading my post of music, yeah i'm a big fan of prog............opeth, yes, dream theater, genesis etc. etc. as long as the songs exceed 8 minutes, i'll listen to it.......lol. I've also been scouring the net for piano scores, by Nobuo Uematsu especially. They're quite a few decent ones but I can't find the one I've been looking for, which is Sad Piano Theme from Final Fantasy VIII. That's a pretty easy but kinda sad song, that's basically my pre-dominant mood, Melancholy, lol..........  Anyway, hmmmm, i've been thinking lately about Love, after the crappy poem which I wrote, it really makes me want to think about love. To me, Love inspires poetry, Sadness inspires music, Angst inspires Argumentative writing. That's for me anyway, my three main outlets of expression. Yesterday, during CNY, i've really heard alot of stuff, one of my 17-year old cousin is going out with a 30 year old, why? He's rich, extravagant, and she's committment-phobic. I hardly make sweeping and stereotypical statement, but imo, its hollywood's fault.  Superficiality is the killer of every budding relationship, its like a very good, nice, friend, TOO nice in fact, only to stab you in the back later. Money, outward looks, humour, wit, and in some pathetic (emphasis on pathetic) chauvnistic guys' case, submissiveness also. I'm like give me a damn break man. Look at America, breakups, divorces............its like, the inside of a toilet bowl with a faulty flushing system after 10 fat men with diahorrea shits inside there. And no, the answer is not "ohhh ohh, we gotta bring back our UPRIGHT traditional christian values which made us prosperous since our forefathers stepped onto this holy land....." (can anybody say, bigot?) lol.   To me, what's the solution to the problem, its pretty simple,  "Don't look for the best partner, look for the best relationship."  Seriously, you can have a grade A partner but have the crappiest relationship ever, that guy may be the most handsome, witty, talented person you've ever met. But your relationship is lacking in trust, communication and fulfillment. Personally, i don't ask alot in a partner, there's no particular "quality" i look for in a partner. But i really ask alot in a relationship, anything short of satisfying and deep is out of the question to me.   Now, i'm very bored so my mind's kinda empty, and an empty mind is the devil's workshop which is why i never believe in Meditation, emptying your mind stuff. Meditation to me, is really to reflect and think..........but meh, i'm just bored now and got nothing to think about.............  I'll have a post later at night, hopefully...............

      Meh........i'm damn bored now, i've got only 2 games on my comp which i actually completed long ago.......i talked to Ben and Woon Han on MSN just now and talked to Sarah bout' the whole christian feminist thing. But anyway, the theme for today is.......you got it.........BORING ! lol...........so anyway, now kids, its your favourite crappy and sucky poem coposing time with me again............  The Computer Monitor   I glare at him, and he glares back at me, My eyes barely opening i struggled to see him Just wondering when from this spell will I break free. He's the computer monitor, he owns your soul,  Wishing that your boredom be multiplied a thousand-fold.  Seeing her face i sob and pine,  of unrequited love divine. He sits in front of me and sniggers,  Oh how i want to show him the finger. With silence over me, I frown, As the pain consumes my being ever faster I wonder when will I come around To experience again, she and I together in laughter.  For fire i do not fear. Only your coldness would cause a grown man to tear For your indifferent gaze inflicts a searing pain, As i wonder am i doing all of this in vain. For this poem i compose, braving his snigger i conclude. I shut him up, i turn him off, I lay down my head, beneath my sobs To Cry over a love forlorn,  I close my eyes, there she is, With Open arms and a wide, warm smile, From a harsh reality i escape.  Into her sweet embrace, that's where i'll stay. For i know soon, this will end, into the painful reality will I be sent. Braving his smirks yet again, I know you will wait for me here all the same........ .  ..............................>>>>>>>>>>>>>

      Yeah, CNY today, got quite abit of cash. I've got around 300 plus the cash i've saved up and all.............hmmm......but i don't think you'd be very interested to hear of my monetary pursuits today. So, anyway.........hmmm, i've been feeling kinda depressed today and yesterday, i kept thinking about her..........but since so many people's eyes are fixed on this blog, i'll shut up about her as well........lol  Anyway, its kinda spooky, after my 2nd post about the whole christian feminist thing, the google ad on top started displaying christian stuff, like bible schools and the like...........i mean its like, how the heck did they know what i typed? lol. I've also been thinking alot of stuff today. Music especially, music. I've been learning three slayer songs this morning and its pretty easy except for the off-key solos (thanks jeff, king......)......But i've really been thinking about my growth and development as a musician  My sister was there at my cousin's house singing, and i was thinking to myself, i don't think i could play guitar or the piano in front of that many people.........inferiority complex or not, i don't know. But, i see music as more of an outlet for expression, instead of an entertaining art form. My attitute towards music especially which i improvise and ocassionally compose, is that i don't really give a shit whether people likes it or not, or whether even if its musically pleasing to the ears. Those pop-punk posers care too much of that, ohhhh, will my record label like it? Will the fans like it?  Teenagers nowadays think that they're so darn rebellious but they're nothing but a pathetic lapdog to this generic pop culture. I mean, look at WA mozart, beethoven and the like They just compose, improvise, even if the song drags on for 20 minutes, who cares if the audience get bored? Music, has always been to me, a form of expressing feelings, emotions and beliefs, and sometimes certain emotions can be so deep and complex that it takes a long long time to really say it out............  Music really chronicles the different milestones and phases of your life. Sometimes, you can tell how a person feels when he/she chooses to express him/herself from the chosen outlet of expression, and in this case its music. Music to me, has been like a soulmate,..............everytime when I pick up a guitar and improvise its almost like talking to a confidante, everytime when i'm drunk or just pretty tipsy on beer and i stop feeling anything on my fingertips when i fret the notes, and just play intuitively, its really like having sex. That's what music is, it is not an overexagerration to say that playing music is like having sex. That's why i always believe that 3 minute pop songs is tantamount to pre-mature ejaculation, there's just too much emotion and energy involved in a true musician's playing that it takes time to express it all out.  To me, it doesn't take much skill to express your feelings through music. In guitar, i can take at most a week to learn a simple song over a few basic chords and this very song can be my emotional outlet. True, the playing and singing may suck, but who cares? You're ultimately doing what a true musician always does, expressing him/herself instead of wondering is this song nice? Will it be a hit with other people? I mean, i feel that if i play the way i do behind closed doors in my own room in front of other people, its like a public live sex show, that's like, no way! I'm pretty selfish where my music is concerned, i like to keep it to only me and myself................i'm not like the egocentric malmsteen to have all spotlights shining on me as i play in front of thousands of people so that people can worship me as the guitar god or anything, i don't really care about what people think of me as a guitarist. Music, to me, has been very private, so if you don't like how i play, i'm like, buzz off, i don't need your approval, cos' if that's adequate in expressing myself, its good enough for me.

      Hmmmm................ok second post, yeah today's CNY Eve, so expecting to get tons of angbaos this year. I want to get a boss ME-50 ! or some stuff to improve my crappy, plastic solid-state amp distortion, and make it tube...........the ROAR of a 12ax7 with the grind of a el84 poweramp tube............but in the meantime i'll settle for second best, in multi-FX but distortion is my topmost priority.............(if you're not a guitar player....read the next paragraph lol......)  Right, i've been thinking about alot of stuff (as always.......), i've really been reading alot about christian feminism and really been thinking about the first thing that got me fascinated with society, theology and philosophy all at once, feminism, christian feminism in fact, it may seem to be like an oxy-moron, but i think that its highly possible. I don't feel that christian patriachal teachings are that consistent imo. Just a few verses by paul to get the women kept in the kitchen.............but anyway, its not that i don't believe in the bible or anything lol, far from that, here are a few arguments against patriachal teachings which use the words of paul..........       * The arguments for subordination: Women are intended to have a role and place under men, and are thus excluded from the ordained ministry. This is the most common evangelical argument against women in ministry, or in favor of a limited role for women under the authority of a man, and an enormous weight of cultural, philosophic and Biblical evidence is brought to bear on this point. To the extent that we have inherited Greek gender ideals as a part of our civilization these notions of subordination run very deep. The Biblical foundation of these arguments begins with the second creation account, where Eve was created after Adam as a helpmate, evidence that women were always intended to be under men. Subordinationists argue also, that the curse on women is prescriptive rather than descriptive. With these theological assumptions already in place the widely debated 1 Corinthians 11 passage: "the head of every woman is man, and the head of Christ is God," and associated demands for head coverings, are then interpreted as further evidence for the subordination of women.        *Other scholars have answered in rebuttal that later creation does not entail inferiority, as witnessed by Adam's place in the order - after lower animals, and the word "helpmate" is used most often of God helping people, and thus does not bear connotations of subordination. Furthermore, the curse on women should be interpreted like that on men, as an evil to be resisted rather than a burden to be accepted. Against 1 Corinthians 11 it has long been argued that many much clearer Biblical passages teach equality. More recently Paul's enigmatic utterances have been interpreted within the context of the fertility and Gnostic cults of the time, where the bared heads of women might be interpreted as symbolizing prostitution. Careful exegetes also claim that the word for "head" (kephale) is better interpreted as "source", rather than leader.     * The arguments on silence: Much is made of the injunction in 1 Timothy 2:11-14: "I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner," and the 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 passage: "women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak..." Many commentators have long considered these verses to be culturally embedded statements, at odds with Paul's own practice, and Galatians 3:28. The Greek word "speak" (laleo) in Corinthians, is easily rendered "babble," and the word "silence" (sigao) bears connotations of desisting from chatter. Paul may have been seeking order in an unruly congregation. The rare Greek word translated "authority" (authentein) in 1 Timothy may be better rendered "usurping authority," and the word for "silence" here connotes peace and harmony (hesuchia). The references to Adam's priority and Eve's duplicity make sense as a refutation of the pervasive Gnostic belief in Eve as a fertility goddess, the source of all life, who cleverly outwitted the creator and Adam. This may be Paul's way of insisting that Eve did not come first, Eve's actions were a sin against the Creator God, and women need to be in harmony with rather than usurping the authority of men.         * From Genesis 3, and from 1 Timothy 2, it is argued that women are more easily deceived than men. These latter verses are most readily understood as directed against the Gnostic beliefs discussed above. But this concern over deception has long restricted women (the majority in most congregations) to teaching only children or other women. Questioning this position, others have pointed out the dangers of allowing easily deceived women to teach children. And as David Scholer has noted, the implications of believing women deceived "contradict the reality of the whole of biblical teaching, church history and human experience."    yeah, even Jesus himself did not say anything about female submission ! in fact, he did the opposite, not of females lording over men, like some bra-burning feminists, but he really broke the social norms of that time...........the reason why Jesus commended the woman with the issue of blood was her faith..........but since i was young, i was kinda puzzled, she had faith? she just reached out and grabbed Jesus' garment ! Okay, the shame factor was one thing, but if i had terminal cancer in my blood, lungs and liver, i'll grab Jesus' garment amongst a big crowd in Orchard Road all the same !!!! She may not even be expecting to get healed by touching the garment, but maybe just asking Jesus to slow down or stop.  I soon discovered that it was because she broke the social and gender norms of that time, it was then considered unclean for a woman to touch a man in public..........yeah, that was why Jesus commended her for her faith.........now let me put this in a more modern singaporean context.........lemme see...........ummmm.......umm.......ok.......say If our senior minister was walking down orchard road, greeting fellow Singaporeans along orchard, and there you are, your shirt is black, dirty, and your hair looks as if you're part of an experimental fashion program and you stink, why? You've spent all your money on treatment, dialysis, and the like. You can't pay your water bills for a decent bath, let alone get decent clothes.  Would you go up to the SM and ask him to seek redress for your case and lift your burden of at the very least poverty.........???  Is the person, dirty and sick, worthy of the senior minister's attention at all?. And is the woman worthy of touching Jesus to ask him to lift her burden of sickness over her life? The fact is no..........and that's faith. To break free from all social expectations of you............  Jesus was a feminist, he encouraged mary to sit at his feet to listen to his teachings, at a time when intellectual pursuits of women were perpetually banned. Well, you may think that women have the right to education. But the treatment of women by Jesus can be taken both Literally and Symbolically. It is essentially, the rage against patriachy, to crush the belief that men are always the leaders. Be it blatant or sublime, all of us should seek to constantly discredit patriachal beliefs and assertions. Be it in chivalry and gentlemanliness, or the system of disallowing or discouraging women to take up leadership positions especially in ecclesiatical circles..............  Ok, fine, i'm done ranting, i really seek your comments and if i find them helpful, feel free to e-mail me (if its a long essay) or to sign in the guestbook (is there a guestbook? i dunno lol, i'm still a noob here.......) but anyway, you can e-mail me at.......  ugmail544@yahoo.co.uk  (MSN accn. also)  By e-mailing me, you basically say that i can publish and rebut your articles here...............(unless you state otherwise..........)  I'm in a very theological mood recently, but not all my posts would be about Christianity lol.......

And of course, don't expect me to write too personal stuff, people are watching, and one of those people is you.........but blogs are meant to be kept public, for this blog that is, so i won't be asking you to piss off just as yet.........so it would kinda reflect my thoughts of that day, philosophical, spiritual, sociological, etc. etc...............you know.........  Yeah the above post is just simply to fill up space so that i can really view my blog lol...........i'll get some serious stuff posted up soon............

      I feel lonely now, I don't know where are you, what are you doing. I just wish I could get more involved in your life, sometimes you're so close, sometimes you're so distant. Sometimes, I don't know even what you think of me just as a friend, just friends. Don't be afraid to burden me with your problems, don't be afraid to tell me what really bugs you, I will never be burdened. Indeed, you have hurt me in the past, but I do not mind. Sometimes when I see you looking down, feeling sad, I really want to comfort you and I hope to share this sorrow and burden with you, but I can't do that, I can't, really. To me, now, the most precious thing I can possibly have is never money, nor anything fancy, but really, is conversations with you. And I can honestly say that whether I feel happy, sad or angry, in short, my moods, are almost entirely dependent on you. Distance, I don't know if it makes the heart grow fonder or not, but what I know is that distance has caused much sorrow for me.

      lol, long time never update blog already man, cos' alot of DT, i most scared my emaths sia, set until very hard. But hmmmm, with so much tests lately i've got no linggan all drained away, that's what the education system does to you, drains your inspiration. I finally got CD-R so can burn things already. Haiz, i think i should find a topic just to rant about, ok.............I want to talk about love.  Love, Love what can I possibly write about love? It is probably the most sticky thing on this whole planet which the human race has possibly invented, so addictive, so hurting, so satifying and yet so complex. I used to express love in poems, but I don't know if I can do it in standard essay form. My thoughts on love now are not emotive, rather, its logical and coherent. Okok, i'll talk about her.......nono dun talk about her, later identity kena kan chuan.  WHAT SHOULD I TALK ABOUT? okok, i'll talk about art. What is art? To me, a measure of an artist is not in the amount of technical skill but rather in the amount of self-expression, that's pretty much understood. But i believe that art has to be personal. Look at say, a piece of sky. Take a picture of it and frame it up. Sure, it looks good, its eye candy, but is it art? in my opinion, NO. Art is essentially the conveyance of emotion, its deep and most of the time it is abstract. That's basically what i feel about all forms about art.  Most forms of "art", certain visual arts pieces, "pop" music, all those various mediums of art really aims to please the senses but they fail to please the heart. To those people who say that they listen to classical music to "relax"........i can tell you that its the most myopic statement in all musical history. Classical music, really is meant to make u concentrate on the piece, listen up, and understand what the composer is trying to tell you despite the piece staying at a sedate 60 BPM and with the rhythym throughout. Classical music is perhaps the most complex, intense genre of music, and I have to admit, I have yet to fully appreciate it yet.  If you really appreciate art, it really bypasses your senses and it goes straight into your heart. The piece can really suck, but you understand what the artist was really feeling at that time. Some songs can sound horrible, off beat and out of tune, but once you get the message, the vibe of it, the emotions within it all, that song is really a very powerful force in your life.  okok enough, i writing cos' i 4 days never update my blog lol

      The Design Argument:  "Look at our universe and planet, it is so tastefully and perfectly designed, there must be a God who created all of this instead of a series of random events."   (fyi, if the universe was a result of random events, cosmologists has calculated that there would be a 1 in 10^120 (10 to the power 120) chance that the universe came about.)   The Evil Argument:  "Look at the amount of evil polluting our World today, If there is a God out there, I'm sure he would stop all of this..............so, There really is no God........"   (btw, some words I use may be abit too technical, go to www.dictionary.com . If there are any words in which you do not understand.)  Ok, now that we have established what is the Design and Evil argument, I'll start my essay.  	 	Two opposing camps caught in a philosophical deadlock. That is basically the case for Theists and Atheists today. Ideologically on polar opposites, the “champions” of their ideologies, the most formidable weapons used, just like David and Goliath, with an outcome yet to be decided, is the design argument and evil argument respectively.  	 The design argument is by far the strongest, most logical and arguably the simplest argument for the existence of a God. Cosmologically speaking, the very presence of life on this Earth, if it was a result of random reactions and events, as affirmed by certain atheists, it would be near impossible (I never believe in such a thing as total impossibility) to justify the sustenance and existence of life on this very universe and planet throughout the course of history. To bring it closer to out planet, examples such as the nitrogen, water cycle as well as the many eco-systems in our planet today, showcases a near perfect design of our Earth. 	 However, along comes Goliath, the evil argument, that is. Just when David thought he has defeated the Philistines, Goliath crept into his tent and challenged him to a duel. In my opinion, the evil argument, has been the most hotly debated between both camps, due to its almost entirely philosophical nature, without any reference to science whatsoever, as compared to the design argument. Due to the philosophical nature of this argument, it is never difficult to come up with a counter-argument, any counter argument. But the thing is whether that particular counter-argument is logical, coherent and conclusive. Below is a common counter-argument used by theists, used by Christians especially, I’ll refute that………. (I’ll defect for a little while). 	 “God gave us free will, he did not make us into robots who obey every single command he gives us, God does not want the human race to be like that, and thus, with free will, evil would start to creep in. Besides, the same gravity which keeps us on our feet, is gravity which causes people to fall to their deaths……..” 	 What do I think of this particular counter-argument? A Total contradiction to the design argument, in my opinion, say we assume God to be perfect (don’t ask me what if He’s not, its tiring enough to formulate a hypothesis based on this one assumption alone, maybe I’ll come to that some other time……..). Say God has perfect wisdom and intelligence, as shown in the intricate and expert design of our universe and planet. I do not think that God, in all his (generally speaking) omniscience would have any problem designing free will which would not let the problem of evil exist, and neither would he have any problem designing a type of gravity which would keep us glued to this Earth but yet prevent us from falling to our death. Moreover, the design argument has already shown the existence of such a God. 	 Now, what will be my counter-argument then? It can be summarized into “what really is good, what really is evil?” The essence of my counter-argument is that good and evil has to exist hand in hand and good and evil mainly exists hand in hand. This is a counter-argument used mainly by theist philosophers without any specific religious affiliations whatsoever. 	 Firstly, every quantity is relative. Before the nature of its magnitude can be determined (e.g. Long, short, big, small), there has to be a yardstick, a point of reference, in which it has to be measured. Take one week for example, a quantity of time, we can never brand it as a long or short period of time, unless we measure it against something. 1 week for the completion of a building? 1 week for your toenails to grow 1 cm? 1 week for light to travel 5 kilometers? Only when we measure a quantity against a yardstick, can we say “whoa, that’s fast……” or “wah lau eh……..why so slow sia…?”Well, in the context of the evil argument, the yardstick for evil is good, and for good, it is evil. Still unconvinced? Read on…… 	 Imagine you’re in your kitchen and there on your kitchen table sits a bowl of sugar. (btw, this sugar analogy is borrowed from Nietzsche’s good friend, who was also a philosopher when Nietzsche was in his 20s, can’t remember his name though………….). This sugar is only sweet when it touches the tip of your tongue, and sends a signal to your brain saying “sweet”. But take that you’re a person with a sweet tooth. Will you be saying “meh……..lousy sugar……it’s not even sweet!” But take it you’re born a diabetic who has eaten everything bitter, sour, spicy but never sweet, would be saying “wonderful! I’ve not tasted anything so sweet in my entire life!” In this analogy, what is the yardstick in which to measure sweetness? In the sweet tooth’s case, it is his constant exposure and experience with all things sweet. As for the diabetic, his yardstick is the bitterness and sourness he has tasted in this entire life. From here, we can see that the same sugar with supposedly the same sweetness, can be both sweet and bland at the same time. 	 The same goes for the evil argument. 1 act can be either called “good”, “evil” or “meh….nothing special….”. Depending on the yardstick in which it is measured. Take the act of helping up someone who has fell down, it may be a good deed no doubt.  But say, someone who has fell down on the pavement in a park and you helped him up, and compare this to you helping someone up in a time of war, with enemy soldiers hot on your heels………….which one of the following acts has more “good” in it? Indeed, evil is amplified in an atmosphere of good and good is amplified in the atmosphere of evil. 	 In my opinion, there are no absolutes in life, good and evil is simply a matter of perception. What we define as good and evil, we measure it with a yardstick, a yardstick of social norms, our upbringing and/or our religion. There is never such a thing as true objectivity as reflected in sociology and the study of social sciences. We never look at any one issue with our naked eyes. We look at it through the lenses of our society, religion etc. which invariably distorts the image. Good and evil is a point marker in a very big field, this point marker is ever-changing, what is evil today may not be evil 2000 years down the road and vice versa. 	 Which leads to my belief in yin and yang, what constitutes yin and yang of course, is variable. But to put it in the most general definition, yin and yang represents the co-existence of both positivism and negativity, and from this co-existence exists perfection. And you can say that I’m somewhat a dualist, where this argument is concerned. The thing that I have with certain Christian beliefs is that sometimes, it focuses too much on the positive side. Where feelings is concerned, sadness and happiness have to co-exist, excessive sadness makes you suicidal, depressed, but excessive happiness makes you apathetic to people who are sad, and sometimes, cocky. 	 Sadness is perhaps the greatest inspiration for the best music and poetry ever composed. Feelings which we view as negative do have a positive impact on our life if applied the right way and released in the right manner. Many reforms, political, social, religious or otherwise, would not have taken place, if their founders were not angry with the current state of events. Anger, a negative emotion, has been harnessed and channeled to bring about positive changes and reforms to make the society in which we know of today. 	 In conclusion, I admit, my counter-argument is neither conclusive nor was it even meant to conclusive in the first place. But I hope someone can get a fresh perspective from this particular essay, and hopefully this can contribute in some way into a logical and conclusive counter-argument. 	  Longest post ever...............lol

      Alright, i'll pretty much get you updated on my life, before I get down to serious business, which is the 5 page essay which i just wrote lol, on the design and evil argument and the case for God. lol, next week is a DT week, so I gotta really study this week..............I can't really update my blogs on weekdays lol, and my poems, as I predicted would really bore some of you................so, inspiration was floating in the air, I caught it, and came up with an essay in 45 minutes, but the thoughts which actually came into this essay, is a product of a long period of thinking and questioning............  I've gotten back into guitar already........yay!!!! Cos' i was really in the "rock" kinda mood, and I've actually learnt one thing, ever since I got back into playing guitar, I actually learnt one thing, which can be summarized into one word......."finesse"........Yah..........what really is Finesse? Finesse is skill to put it in simple words. I used to be able to do mean triplets and shred like mad.........but i can say, now my shred sounds as if there's something big jammed inside the paper shredder...........lol. But my Bends, vibratos, dynamics and sense of expression has really improved tremendously. I never knew simple passages which I played in the past can be done so tastefully..........and using pentatonics can beat some fancy scale/mode in which I picked up from somewhere. Getting down to basics imo................  okok, now my essay's up next...........

       One more poem, this time, to one of my friends...you know who you are..............    Untitled     Walking into her house, cold and empty, Sitting in the corner sobbing and crying. Empty is her heart, and hurt is her soul Mommy saw her,but a tissue, she did not offer. Tears streaming down, as their callousness, her heart,it pierced.  Their attention she tried to sieze, their love she tried to earn. But how? when her feelings, they repeatedly crush............ In her heart, a love for them it hid, clouded by hate Feeling unwated, in sleep she tries to sedate........  Sitting there alone as her sisters play, But her problems she do not wish to say. An injured soul, indeed, looking for comfort. But all she got were replies, almost curt. I walked towards her, with her friends behind. Words of love is my gift, and hugs are our present. For in amongst us, solace can she find.  Walking out that huge door, an emotional baggage left behind. Daddy does not care, as her sisters continue playing. Her house, she does not belong, in her nest, love, she could not find. As she left, Mommy's face, it was not sad. But Looking back, this home, she would never ever want to come back..........

      Lonely lonely valentine's day...............lonely..............except with Ben Chin han and all lol.........here's a poem.....for my boredom.........and her..........I love you...........    Lonely Valentine's     Till the 16th valentine, a cynic I was, Till she came, a heart of stone I possessed. Together with the lonely, company I had. Great company they were, but emptiness still resides. Hurt was my soul, when you left me alone. Watching the waves with the lonely, Threading the sand with them, but when can I? When can I spend this day, this day, with only you and I?  A lonely, lonely valentine I always had. But this loneliness seemed to be amplified. Through your absence, through your callousness. For my Love, none had tasted, but yours, many had. An understatement indeed, to say I did feel sad. Depression creeps up to me, and solitute I dread. All I want is to spend my 17th with you, and only you........  Alone.........

      Here's a poem for her............not Lynette, but her.........if you know who i mean..........    The Pendulum     A string on a ball, that's how my life is. Rising and falling, a natural cycle it has become. All my life, a still pendulum I have been. Until the day, when her real self, I have seen. Till the time, when my pendulum she pushed. Up and up I went, but the ecstacy lasted until then.  Please do not ignore me, please do not deplore me. For if my words, a smile it gives you, Contentment would I feel, lest it is all a ruse. For jealousy grips me heart and cynicism suffocates me. Your breath i could not feel, you scent, my nose, it could not reach.  How I wish to have a heart-felt conversation with you. Your patient confidante, i would gladly be. Far beyond the surface, our understanding I wish to reach. But how could I? When my feelings I refuse to ditch? For if supression is my sacrifice, I would gladly do it, with all of my heart  This pendulum, I don't want to be,  This endless cycle do I want to be free. Please push this pendulum again,  and hold it there once the top,it reaches For only you can release me from this pain, only you.......

      No absolutism here, no nothing, all I am filled with now is EMOTIONS, that is basically it.............i'm just a pure blob of emotion, no logical thoughts running through my head now. I went for a camp, and I just came back. It really has taught me alot. Not the programmes or anything, but because one girl from my class got knocked down by a van, she's ok now, no internal injuries, it is mainly superficial, fractures in the arms and pelvic bones mostly, and pretty major fractures, i must add.  I saw the whole process, the whole process, everything. I did not dare to go see the state she was in when she was on the road, but all i could feel that is she was in immense pain, immense............the worst part was that she was conscious too. Her friends were crying, her close friends....................tabby, lin, clara.......and i must add, even though I hardly talk to her and all, i still do feel something..............to see my own classmate get knocked by a van.....................Here's a poem i composed for her...........    The strongest girl who ever lived      The scent of jubilance saturates the morning air,  And the birds, their chirps, based on a major. I saw you, quiet and reserved, just as ever. Up the bus you went, not knowing what a fate it might deliver All this while, a love for you, in our hearts it hid For we would never have realized how much you mean to us, till the day, the van, it sped.  But I hope you realize our desire,  Our desire to share this burden with you, to lessen this pain for you Our love we no longer want to hide, For all we want you to do is to continue to fight.  Our class would never be complete without you. Our hearts will forever exist a vaccum only you could fill. For we know of your bravery, we have witnessed your courage. We know you do not want us to shed a tear for your sake. But we're sorry, this wish, we could never fulfill. Please be strong, Lynette, please get well soon. For only with your return, will our hearts keep still..........

      Lol, i'll be going for camp from tomorrow (wednesday) till Friday afternoon, so my blog won't be updated for a pretty long time. Ok.........i'm listening to Andy Lau's Bing Yu now........not a bad song.......imo. But yeah, ok, i'll get into my topic for today now. The topic is..........   There is always a logical, coherent counter-argument to every argument     This is basically what i call a thinking cycle. This is a process by which all human intelligence thrives, once this cycle ends, once an argument is supposedly unchallenged. That is when human intelligence cease to exist. Well, if you still belong in your pathetic little world, and think that "well, what's the point of thinking so much, i'll just lead a happy life, and just be happy.............." Well, let me tell you this, this computer you're looking at now, is a product of someone questioning the laws of physics, this society you live in is a product of someone questioning an argument in sociology, the medicine you take when you are sick is a product of someone questioning the laws of biology.  Everything which you experience and enjoy now, is a product of someone thought patterns and you, are just enjoying the fruits of that. The mind is like a machine, it needs fuel to survive. But that's the problem with our society today. That's the problem with the education system, in almost every part of the world.  But true, the mind needs fuel to survive, but how is the fuel produced is what matters. Say, you've got 15 Joules worth of energy worth of fuel, but will it produce 15 joules worth of work? That's the problem, it means that the brain is simply maintaining itself, without being entirely effective. What does the afore-mentioned illustration signify? It signifies the feeding of knowledge to the human mind. That's basically the study of existing facts, and the mastery of it. In chemistry, I want you to study the topic on covalent and ionic bondings. But i do not expect you to question this particular "fact" and instead accept it as universal and undisputed. And, questioning is non-existent.  But, the right model for the human mind, and the human mind in which is was basically designed for. Is for 15 joules of energy being fed into the brain and 150 joules of work gets done. This is a process of a starting fuel, being processed by the brain to be made into something more productive. And what is this refining process called? This process in which knowledge is multiplied? It is called questioning. Which is why, i strongly encourage the learning of arts (social sciences, philosophy) and the like, because it encourages questioning instead of just learning the hard facts.   That's basically it, i'm gonna sleep soon..............so bye............i'll debunk absolutism on my next post........so good night.......

      I'm listening to dream theater now another prog band, its 1:47 in the morning now, i got piano class, and i'm gonna show her how i improvise yay !!!!!!! but the pieces she gave me to practice i still haven't gotten around to practicing them yet, cos' its all major stuff...........eee, dunno why, major stuff i think like abit childish, like mary had a little lamb all is major one, even ABC song is major..............lol...........so i'm a minor person. Like I said, i express my sadness through music, angst through essays, and love through poetry......  Btw, i've been talking so much about my piano playing. But i feel that my guitar playing has deteriorated considerably, and my amp's distortion has been increasingly crappier. I feel that my playing has been crappier as well. I can hardly do proper legato and improvise like I did in the past now...............haiz..........sad......i've neglected my "chu lian".......lol...........I've been running low on inspiration lately, i only got basically inspiration to write poems but none to write essays already, maybe its cos' i'm tired...........  lol, i'm glad that her and I are talking again, if not, this whole blog would be filled with poems. And then i'll probably end up like me friend (identity witheld) who is still depressed after the girl he liked still dun want to talk to him..............haiz..........but he's a good guy though, dunno why she dun like him.........and stuck with one pathetic guy as her boyfriend. I've been reading up on astrology and horoscopes lately, but i believe that astrological predictions has to be abstract instead of specific. But i believe that astrology is really God's guide to deterrmine our destiny.  A misconception about astrology is that everyone on this planet born on the same day, would share the same destiny etc. But really your destiny also depends on the place and time you were born et cetra. Also, i believe free will has a hand in this as well. There is a main path which is decided by your astrological sign, and that path leads to something positive, but free will allows the person to steer to a different course of a destiny, in many different parts of their life. ( anyway, that's pretty philosophical, so if you don't understand, but want to understand, read again, lol......)  I'm stopping here, i may want to go on, but its 2 am and i wanna sleep.................

      Here's a poem I composed.     The Piece      From a minor to a major i change. But a major, i dwell for only a while. To ponder why the music has stopped. Deafening is the silence, amidst thoughts so chaotic, Why can't I play on? For a note, did I play wrong?  Inspiration leaves, leaving me cold. And thoughts about her, where did it all stem from? Her voice I hark, but none could I hear  My piece is she willing to listen, my song, she wishes to hear. But why can't I play it in front of someone I hold so dear? Fatigue overwhelms me, as she listens impatientily. For I have waited for her to come, waiting all night For i know only after my piece you've heard, will I ever sleep so tight.  I wonder when will she return. Musty and lonely is the room as the door she closes. Please forgive me for this piece gone awry. For your return will I await, and a better piece will I play, that's my promise. My emotions would it reflect, your heart would it touch.  But please do not leave me alone............... For your guidance do I need, your help do I seek. Please teach me how to play this piece, this piece of Love. Please come in again, to show me how..........  Please...........

           In philosophy, the watch analogy which I use is basically part of the design argument. A theist's argument, to argue for the existence of God. The design argument is basically that the whole entire universe is so complex and there has to be an intelligent being to create it. That's basically the strongest theist argument for God, and its still pretty hard for Atheists ro refute that. I'll come to the evil argument used by atheists later, and also, us theist have not really formulated a conclusive and satisfactory counter-argument.        Alright, what about the state of religion and science today? It is obvious the rift between these 2 camps is definitely increasing. And this basically comes to my belief in Yin and Yang. And before some chrsitians point the finger at me, telling me how I'm going to burn in hell for believing in such heathen principles. All i can say is that I believe in eclecticism where schools and systems of thought is concerned. I mean, we can all forget all about democracy if the first European settlers to America had not embraced a system of democracy, thought of by the Greeks, who believed that their Gods made mischeif with mortal's lives, had sexual orgies and a bunch of illegetimate kids.                But, those bunch of settlers, despite building America with Christian principles and ethics in mind, did embrace a school of thought by a bunch of people with a totally different religious background. What was I trying to say? (i'll come on to my belief on Yin and Yang later.........) I was trying to say that,  don't reject principles which you are not familiar with or if of a different school of thought. Never hesitate to pick up principles you find applicable and practical to your life, be it buddhist, sikh, gnostic, communist, capitalist, socialist, federalist, nihilist, darwinist or whatever.               The religious nowadays are basically the most touchy people in modern society. Just a whiff of the winds of change, the whiff of feminism, darwinism and the like sends them running for shelter. And they start pining for the good old days where traditional principles prevailed. In short, modern society offends them. True, they can be the funkiest, most contemporary people around, but i'm not adressing fashion around here, i'm addressing the issue of conflicting principles.               Science is disgusting to the religious............i mean, sure, as long as science do not step across the boundaries of religion, they're fine with that. Take for example, when Joshua "stopped" the day when he fought a war. What makes you think that God did that with a snap of his fingers, but not, God making a meteor out of a ball of dust from a galaxy 5 million light years from the milky way, starts flicking it, and soon it hurtles to our galaxy, to our solar system, and it hits the moon of the Earth which causes a change of the gravitional pull on the Earth and the Earth stops rotating?               That's when science starts to intrude in the boundaries of religion, and the religious starts to get offended. Why? their oh-so-precious notion of God snapping his fingers get destroyed into something which can be put into a scientific thesis. Its like Galileo Galilee, when he intruded into the church's notion of the Earth being in the center of the universe, he got imprisoned and persecuted for his beliefs. Of course, we know Galilee was right. But are we like the church back in Galileo's time? Are we resistant to new, well-founded concepts and schools of thoughts which come our way? And our only consequence is to be proven wrong many decades later.....................               Btw, i'm not referring to science exclusively, in this analogy, this includes new sociological, political, economic and philosophical ideas. Of course, i'm not saying that we follow wherever the crowd follows. But, what i was saying is that do not dismiss anything out of your religious pride. Always question new and alternative schools of thoughts starting from a neutral stance, and seriously, if God does not want us to believe in science and us still believing in him snapping his fingers all the time, he would not give us something called a brain...........duh......that's pretty obvious..........lol               Then regarding the scientific community. I never believe in personal belief intruding into the scientific process. Scientists are mainly involved in the study of science and not arts, there should never be philosohical or sociological hints in any of their theories and works. Darwin was obviously playing Black metal music when he wrote his theory of evolution. Actually his original title for his theory was "I hate God and here's why" but his secetary decided to change it anyway.                ome Scientists, in their haughty and arrogant nature, make their primary job disproving religious concepts and beliefs. While some religious beliefs are opressive and certain scientists have certainly contributed to society by disproving them, there are many who disprove religion to feed their ego instead of doing it out of altruism.                My advice to both sides is to seek to work with each other. Just like my watch analogy, there is no superior way to find out the secrets of the watchmaker and the watch. Why don't the scientist and priest shake hands, and both can share their knowledge both their findings using their different methods to get the same, common goal in half the time.   (sorry, i'll come to yin and yang and the argument of evil some other time lol..........)

      YAY !!!!! She's finally talking to me...........but hmmmm..........ok, i've got a geog test tmr, and tons of homework to complete, tuition included, so the mood for today........is STRESS !!!!!!!! ok....i think i better get a grip on myself........its really poor time management sometimes, but sometimes is maybe i rely too much on inspiration to get my homework done..........:p . I think i gotta change that, cos' homework is stifling and this whole cirriculum is too science-orientated instead of arts-orientated, and where the heck are subjects such as philosophy and social sciences in our cirriculum?????? No where to be found !! i gotta go the Uni before i can learn them, its crap seriously............  Cos' science is the pursuit of constant principles in the face of a reality which is constantly-evolving. (alright, maybe i'll elaborate on that sometime, but it won't be that soon, cos' i still got feminism and God on the waiting list of essays.) The afore-mentioned statement is really a jab at absolutism. But yeah, another rant for another day...................  Ok, i think my blog needs a revamp seriously, but most templates i found on the net are either a reflection of this generic pop culture, or it inadequately, and inaccurately reflects my thoughts and character. So, unless you've got some good ones, you can leave it in the comments section...........but anyway busy on MSN, so this would be the end of today's entry............

      Alright, i don't know why...........my mind has been pretty blank lately. But its not that i'm just something empty. But seriously, there are tons of emotions inside, instead of logical, coherent thoughts. No poems now, cos' my friend told me that there are too many poems in this blog......!! but, its not that i let others dictate what goes in this blog really, cos' there's no inspiration to write one..........  But yeah, hari raya haji today, hmmmmm, very rainy outside, i'm listening to opeth now, after 4 days of listening to Eason Chan, i decided to revert to my old "diet". But i'll probably be listening to him again pretty soon................My posts would be pretty short for the next few days, cos' there's only one thing which dictate whether i get to write stuff, or play guitar/piano.............its only one thing........that's INSPIRATION !!! So currently, my inspiration tank is dry.   Ok fine, i think i got a bit of inspiration now to write about..................ummm, inspiration........  Alright, to me, insipiration is something which is in the air, its not inside you, its like the wind, sometimes it comes, sometimes it goes, and sometimes it can be found more in certain places, sometimes less. Inspiration is a spiritual experience, inspiration causes the best paintings, the best musical pieces, the best poems, the best writings. Inspiration transport you from your mundane everyday existance, to a place filled with surrealistic images, where stark emotions hit you, stark.............It can be darkness, melancholy, happiness, love................Inspiration is when a painter does not feel his fingertips on the paintbrush, is when a pianist doesn't feel his fingers on the ivory, when a writer doesn't feel his fingers on the pen.   It is when your body responds like clockwork to your heart, bypassing the technical aspects of your craft, like, should i add a string bend, to this guitar solo?, should this particular linear scale, be done in legato, should I use the C melodic minor and add a flatted 5th? should i add blue, or red to this painting? All this questions would be non-existant in the presence of inspiration. Because, normal mundane practicing of your craft is what your brain tells your body to do. But inspiration, is what your heart tells your body to do.  Artists today do not have that privellage, you would never have inspiration if you work withing a time frame. "I want that piece composed by the end of this week." "The client wants that painting by thursday !!" Is inspiration dying out? Does the winds of inspiration blows at us, and we still cannot feel its presence? To me, also, inspiration is when you are "out-of-body". When you don't feel anything in your flesh and blood, and sometimes, alcohol helps.   But ok, i'll come to the topic on alcohol and all here. Firstly, don't get addicted. But inspiration usually comes when you're toeing the line between soberness and drunkedness, so, drugs do not help imo, unless you're a professional drug-user such as Hendrix, and use depresseant drugs instead of stimulants, but that's my opinion after all, so don't take it at face value....................lol.........

      I actually meant to type this post somewhere in the afternoon, and i did...........but i accidentally closed the whole window, so everything was gone.......Ok.......fine.........  Regarding my analogy on God, i don't intend to expand on that anytime soon lol, so everything regarding God will be shelved for now, and now I'm working on an essay about feminism, secular 20th-21st century feminism. Cos' really, feminism really started my drive for knowledge and my interest in debate. So i'll get started on that. Actually, i've been conversing with a guy on the net, he set up an anti-feminist website and i went to initiate a debate via e-mail in the form of essays and counter-argument, i submitted my last counter-argument, he has not replied since........:P.........  But aside that, here's something more about what happened.......  I was at my auntie's house yesterday, lowing yu sang,but that's when i managed to improvise on the piano ! My piano teacher has been telling me that i'm now in a stage of my playing where my skills are basically stuck in a rut, and I need a breakthrough moment. And the moment was yesterday..........lol. I used the G and C harmonic minor for the melody and used 5th triads for accompaniment, cos' fifths have no thirds so, they can be used in both the major and minor context. (alright, if you can't understand music, i think i better shut the heck up....)  I was in the mood for talking, I haven't been REALLY talking on MSN for a long time, so i talked to XY and Ben, not bad though, haven't had a good conversation in a long time, but lemme see, my mind is kinda in a whirl now, and lemme see what i should write about today............hmmm you'll see it in the next post.

      I've got alot of linggan now, so can write about stuff. Stella's Birthday's coming up, hmmm, but its just her birthday for this month, so it'll be pretty light i guess, I feel like eating seoul garden again lol........hmm, i shall talk about my week. This week so far has been pretty light, or maybe its like the calm before the storm. I have been reading two books lately.  God is Dead: Secularization In The West  and  How we believe: The search for God in an age of science . The former talks about religion, and the latter focuses more on God in a theistic sense, God in general. The latter has really got me thinking about creationism and evolution, I may post my hypothesis on that here sometime.  Hmmmmm, musically, I've been getting alot into jap and chinese stuff. I think its good, sometimes we get too sucked into the crappy American corporate machine and start to lose our asian identity.  I'm currently listening to Ayumi Hamasaki's Surreal, I love her songs really, it gives a very ethereal, surreal, melancholic feel to it. Very artistic imo, I love Japanese artists, their guitarists are pretty kickass too, go see Ayumi Live, and whoa..........the guitarist can really improvise.........and her live concerts have a string quartet instead of a pre-recorded loop playing on CD, which many artists nowadays do.Asian artists imo, really deserve respect esp. in the international arena. True, there's some crap circulating in the Asian pop world, but a bulk of it really deserves our respect. Unlike in the US, Linkin Park as well as many other rock bands. I mean, Ayumi is not even classified as "rock" but her guitarist, drummist, keyboardist are all kickass.   I hope that the band with Me, han and Ben will really progress, I'm thinking of moving more in the songwriter school of music and then into the Prog school. And then hopefully fuse them both together. Cos' somehow, I can see potential in our band, due to our diverse influences and we have been basically untouched by the evils of modern rock. We can't jam lately due to school and all, but maybe in June we'll prolly get together and then get some things going. Hopefully, Chin Han would be able to contribute in songwriting. Hmmm, ok..........yeah that's it for today......

      I've got physics tuition tomorrow plus a bunch of other stuff, gonna be busy, plus maths tuition on Sunday afternoon. Hmmm, I'm feeling very sleepy now. Listening to XY's Tao Ze now, very nice man, nice voice, good lyrics (except for the english......lol). Imo, he's by far one of the most musical of all pop artists, and you can tell he's got quite a free creative hand at things. Ultrasound is evidence of that. I alos respect him alot because of his songwriting, "Melody", writing about his break up with his girlfriend of 7 years (i think its 7), plus many others which you can tell are really from genuine heartfelt, exposure to love.  This week in school has overall been great, even though MT O'levels are very nearby. I've also been doing quite abit of research on astrology. (Like I said, I believe alot in astrology, western astrology esp.). Reading up on it and stuff. The elections are over (yah i noe long time already, cos' blog never update lol). Very happy with the results. BN won by a great margin. And PAS, I can't stand them man, like any religious bigot, always quoting God after a lost. Besides Astrology, i've also been reading up on Eschatology, but not really the finer points of it, but rather, the philosophical persepctives on the whole subject as a whole. I shall try to crystallize my thoughts on this subject, and this would be in line with the Secularization essay.   Wah on saturday ah, I was damn itchy man............scratching all over the place, all the prawns. I went out with Chin Han and Woon Han orchard road somemore, whole body itchy man, very gao wei. Somemore in the MRT some more, no place to sit. Really sucks. Go home, bathe then sleep the ok already. Hmmm, actually there is some gan chu for this week, where Love is concerned, but I'm not gonna write here definitely. Writing it in a private blog though.......^^.   Yeah I've gtg already, damn sleepy now.........

      huh..........a bian won......I think it sucks, I was hoping for the KMT to win, I'm not surprised if there is a war between China and Taiwan a few years from now. I'm on the side of the Taiwan nationalists, which both Lien Chan and a-bian are. But I am more for Lien Chan's approach towards this issue. Besides, during the time when Chen Shui Bian was in office, Taiwan's economy has been down, together with the relationship with China. Imo, he has caused much dissatisfaction esp. with foreign countries over the handling of the China issue. I definitely think Lien Chan would do a better job in this area as well as in the economy. Well, I have not much expertise on the taiwanese elections. But I hope the Malaysian outcome would be good. Hope the BN would win and take back Trenggannu as well as hopefully to wrest some Kelantan state seats from PAS.  I went out with Chin han and Woon Han today, I WAS ITCHY ALL OVER, must be something I ate, very gao wei man, in the train with the itch all over, can't wait to get home, but after I slept and then woke up, its ok, think its some allergy of some sort. Other than this, my day was pretty uneventful. My essay on Secularization is less than halfway through, but I can tell its gonna be long............

      I'm listening to Tao Ze now, can't find any chinese songs so far, I'm working on an essay regarding the secularization of christianity, esp. charismatic christianity. Jus celebrated XY birthday on Wednesday, not bad lol.......we bought her lingerie, my idea, stella chose it lol........she laughed when she opened it. Play PS play like siao.........then eat also eat like siao, my hair also cut on that day, go QB cut, they all there damn pro, not say cut until damn nice, but the technique is sui man.......I've been following the malaysian elections pretty closely and BN must win. I hate PAS man, those religious bigots. RELIGION AND SOCIETY CANNOT MIX !!!! AND MUST NOT MIX, ANY GOVERNMENT INFLUENCED BY RELIGION SHOULD BE IMPEACHED, I HATE THEOCRAIES !!!!!!! Religion should be segregated from society and politics, religion should be separate, and in short, religion should mind its own business.   And that includes George Bush, a christian bigot imo. Real conservative idiot, I think he invaded Iraq to crush the jewel of the arab world, Baghdad, to prove that Islam is weaker, inferior blah blah blah. And he trying to go beyond his powers to stop gay marraiges, totally unconstitutional....!! Even though I'm against gay marraiges, he has no right to intervene with state policy. NO RIGHT !!! THERE"S NO SUCH THING IN POLITICS AS GOD SAY IT IS SO SO IT IS SO ! no such thing. I want Kerry to win, why? cos' i hate bush, the way he talks.......oh man......he would be better off as a pastor than a president. Ohhh i see a vision of a free Iraq........shut up, yeah u see a free Iraq but at what cost? the lives of US soldiers, the lives of the Iraqis, its like using religion to grope your way around this world, what a pathetic attempt. He's dumb, the way he talks, oh man, a real politician i would say, all talk, no walk. Look at SM Lee, he has much more insight than that guy........MUCH MORE !  I hate people who impose their religion on others who don't accept them. I hate people who think that their religion is the only right way to go. What close-minded bigots. I don't hate religion but i hate the religious. POLITICS MUST REMAIN SECULAR !!!! TOTALLY SECULAR !!! Religion should always be a subset of a community. That's me following elections too closely, but these are my beliefs. SUPPORT BARISAN NASIONAL, VOTE FOR KERRY !  Imo, PAS are dumbasses, so what if you've won a johor seat by default? what does that prove? NOTHING ! maybe your luck, but that's all. Johor really has no place for bigots like you. But I think BN has more chance of winning this election, PAS, imo, would probably fade into oblivion if the BN is lucky. But otherwise, BN has more chance of taking back some territories, Terengganu hopefully, and maybe kelantan. and maybe the BN were a slumbering, corrupted bunch during the 1999 elections, but with Abdullah now on the helm, things seem to be much better, esp. with his promises to rid UMNO of corruption, which the people view as the no. 1 problem in Malaysian politics. But imo, the reason why PAS swept the country was because of firstly, BN's inefficeincy and also, Religious rethoric and fervour was used to a great extent. It was basically a try-and-see move for most PAS voters during 1999 imo. But now, PAS promise this and that this and that, but can they deliver? Well, aside from verses from the Quran.........NO !!!! they can't, they're virtually broke, and need federal help to get their states going. Besides, with Abdullah more focused on Islam now,esp. Islam hadhari, its difficult for PAS to retain its ground imo. But you gotta admit, the barisan alternatif has some pretty tough nuts in there, Haron Din, Wan Azizah Ismail, Hadi Awang, these are people imo, who would probably be the lifeline of the BA.  Ok, since I've not updated my blog for a long time, the next post shall talk about my week.

      I just wrote a letter to Today, a reply over someone who wrote a letter entitled, "Aims of today's feminists are misguided."  Here it is..  Dear Editor, 	I referred to the letter “Aims of today’s feminists are misguided” by Ms Divya Sangameshwar (Today, March 11). I agree with the writer to a certain extent on the state of gender relations in our time and society. However, I feel that the writer has mis-interpreted the aims of the feminist movement. True, the original aim of feminism was to create an egalitarian society as well as greater recognition and rights for women around the world. While how successfully these objectives have been achieved since the heyday of feminism in the 1960s is arguable, it is clear that the landscape of our society has changed thanks to the feminist movement. 	  The writer stated that how the world with 50 per cent women cannot be considered as a “world of men”. But I believe that population cannot be equated with the influence of women in the world. Even more so, if 50 per cent of the human population were women, why are we only seeing a miniscule fraction of women involved in spheres of social, political and economic influence? This can be very much reflected in the gender make-up of the UN general, security assembly as well as the birth-place of modern feminism, the USA, which has not had a woman president, despite more traditional societies such as Indonesia and the Philippines which have seen women taking up the premiership.   What the writer said about men waiting for wives to bring home the bacon, “not without facing ridicule”, is not the result of the feminist movement, but rather such a notion is nothing short of patriarchal and has nothing to do with feminism at all. It would be highly inaccurate to say that our society has totally fulfilled the objectives of feminism. The reason why people view a man waiting for his wife to bring home the bacon as “shameful” is still because that people view traditional feminine roles as being inferior to masculine ones. This can be seen all the way to fashion, it is not uncommon to see women clad in t-shirt and jeans, but it would be highly unlikely that a man appear in a skirt. While feminism has enabled women the freedom to take on masculine roles, it has not won in the battle for minds, and has yet to mould our society into one where both gender roles are viewed as equals.  In the context of gender roles, I believe that feminism has never meant to abolish these essential roles, and neither does feminism seek to reverse traditional gender roles. Feminism is about perfectly inter-changeable gender roles for individuals, both men and women; it is all about the freedom of choice. For example, a working mother may exercise her more masculine traits in the workplace, while she chooses to take on the nurturant, feminine role at home. Even among male, single, working, parents, the situation is no different, and around us in our society we can see people having inter-changeable gender roles regardless of their sex. While it would be unthinkable to brand these people as “bi-sexual”, this was very much the case (maybe not to that extent) before feminism made its voice felt among the developed world.  The writer also stated that feminism should protect the rights for maids, in the local context. However, I believe that any government organization would be able to do the job. While feminism in the 60’s fought the battle against outright and blatant discrimination against women, I believe that the battle for feminists now is sublime, and underground. The battle is for minds and the redefinition of social norms. Someone once said, “I do agree with feminism, its simply feminists whom I got a problem with”. While I admit the behaviour and beliefs of certain feminists can be socially destructive, we should never abandon and overlook the bottomline of the feminist movement, which is simply equality and recognition for both men and women.

      I JUST DELETED MY POST...............DAMN I HATE IT, I HATE IT, I'M FRUSTRATED, ANGRY AND IN SHORT DUN MESS AROUND WITH ME NOW............  ok, hehe, i'll just act happy and assume my happy persona as when i wrote this post, as u can see, this laughter is contrived. Hmmm i just improvised just now, on clean, appregios on guitar, if you're interested......here are chords in which I used.......  F7m/5 003200 Cmaj7 032000 C7madd11+ 034000  These chords basically have very simple fingering, and tons of open strings which allow clearer appregios......and also, it still a pretty good progression for beginners, due to its simple fingering. But it can create amazing textures and tonal colours............  Hmmm, i went out with Chin han, Woon han and Ben to mediacorp today to collect Chin han's SHE mini-concert ticket, only 80 can go sia, and he was one of them, only sent in one entry where others sent in hundreds. Today, was a pretty good day overall...........hmmmm, its 10 and my previous post which i deleted i talk about both the mainstream and avant-garde in all forms of art.............but I've got no linggan now...............hmmmm i think i want to recollect my what happened on my birthday in the next post........

      What shall I talk about today? Ok, yah i'll talk about ontology again, where God is concerened. This will be tied in with epistemology in certain parts. This time it is talking about God and limits. Are there limits to God? Can God create a stone in which he cannot lift? That's the most common question many agnostics esp. would ask. Over here I intend to talk about this. Does God possess limits? In my opinion, No, (i don't intend to substantiate this assumption just as yet, but I'll come up with a hypothesis anyway.......), but I believe he is in control of a varaible limit. When people compare God to something limitless, boundless, they usually think that God is like so Good, so smart, so powerful, that really, he is limitless. But i beg to differ, i mean, how good is good, how smart is smart etc. etc. (check my essay on the design/evil argument).   Even if God is really really powerful etc. there has to be a limit to his power, even if we cannot see it. Its like in CG, we were asked ,"Why do we say God is good and God is not the best?" It is really that Best is a limit of Good, when we say best, it cannot get any better. No matter how fantastic and how far out this limit is, a limit is still a limit. So in here, I shall give a hypothesis on ontology and the nature of God in the context of limits. The greatest gift God has given to mankind is the mind, every single thing you see here, stemmed from a thought, the computer, your handphone etc. The mind is ever-expanding. The fact that Einstein used only less than 5% of his brain matter can testify to that. Even if our intelligence expands, we would still be using the same 5% because our usage expands but so do our capacity.  I'll write about this epistemological hypothesis of mine another time..............i'll talk about how to fly......lol............The human mind expands, from the discovery of fire to Fibre-optics, this shows the flexibility and stretchability of the human mind. And I believe that God has a mind which functions the same way as us, the human mind is prehaps the greatest masterpiece (no matter how great your girlfriend may look).  God is not static, he is always on the move, maybe, when we were at the wheel stage God was at the time travel stage................God has no fixed limit. Because if he did, our human intelligence would be able to reach it, God is constantly moving his limit up and up, to keep up with the progress of human intelligence, human intelligence could acomplish anything, but we could never possibly keep up with the pace of God's limit............What God can do is never fixed, he would always adjust his limit to the development of human intelligence. And God's limit may not always go up and up, if human intelligence is reset, God would have to bring his limit down to the original level.  Which brings me to the issue of cloning........i mean, you've heard about critics saying about the "playing God" thing, and the religious bigot, George. W. Bush has even banned cloning. What i believe is that cloning is playing God but playing God many milleniums ago, when he created the first human, through creation, through evolution, through the big bang or through whatever. Which is why I wondered to myself, why did God created this whole Earth and had to rest at the seventh? I then realized that God had not pushed his limit up yet...........(in creationism that is....)  That's basically it.............I cannot write anymore, my sis is chasing me away from the comp, she wants to use..........lol

      First comment on Ontology where God is concerend   I talked to Sarah about this quite a while back and I think that I would like to talk about it here. It is about the concept of God. Of course God is not a concept, in fact, we can never begin to understand the nature of God only his (generally) ways, but not the intention behind the ways. We cannot express the nature of God into one word. Of course,there are a few words can accurately describe the character of God, but it can never describe it wholly or specifically and it would definitely be nothing short of ambigious. But I believe, to us mortals, that's how God is to us, ambigious. Which is why God is like a star in the night sky, we can only examine it through a telescope, a telescope of religion. This is really the macro-exposure and experience of God which we feel through religion. Now I'm talking about the micro, individual encounters we have with God (generally speaking).  God is so profound, limitless, deep, if we want to talk about his character, we can only talk about it through a subjective perspective, there can never be true objectivity where all ontological discussions of God is concerned. God can only reveal himself (generally) through a specific manifestation, if he throws his entire nature at us, it would not give us revelation but only bafflement. Only when he manifests himself in a specific form, only then can we understand him. Its like feeding a whole cow to a baby, you do it in one short, he'll die, you gotta cut it up into bite-sized pieces for him to eat, but also you probably won't give him to eat the udders or the eyes do you? Its like God, we would only understand a large part of him if we are truly hungry, but we can never know everything, because the "udders" and "eyes" of God's nature can be too profound for our finite human intelligence to every comprehend.  Sarah once told me that she believed God to be a practical God. I said that God is only practical because he showed you his practical side. I believe that the unadultrated manifestation of God to a hippie would be a god with a heavy peace neckalace, microphone hair, someone who preaches peace hope and love to the whole world, and has a mystical air around him, and heck, he even smells as if he protested against the vietnam war yesterday. Because there is this egalitarian, peaceful, cool side of God which he chose to manifest to the hippie.   God encompasses both masuline and feminine, sadness and happiness, yin and yang. Even certain dualists in this particular argument, argue that God is both a good God and Satan at the same time. I don't know about that lol..............(pretty much corresponds with my counter-argument to the evil argument........but I haven't really formulated a good argument to God having dual personalities and roles.). This is basically it.............

      Another personality test, i took, this time a more accurate one, the colour one on the side of my blog.......   Your Existing Situation   Sensitive; needs esthetic surroundings, or an equally sensitive and understanding partner with whom to share a warm intimacy.    Your Stress Sources   Wishes to be independent, unhampered, and free from any limitation or restriction, other than those which he imposes of himself or by his own choice and decision.    Your Restrained Characteristics   Willing to participate and to allow himself to become involved, but tries to fend off conflict and disturbance in order to reduce tension. Feels that he is burdened with more than his fair share of problems. However, he sticks to his goals and tries to overcome his difficulties by being flexible and accommodating.  Egocentric and therefore quick to take offense. Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity but tends to hold aloof emotionally.      Your Desired Objective  Strives for a life rich in activity and experience, and for a close bond offering sexual and emotional fulfillment.    Your Actual Problem  Fights against restriction or limitation, and insists on developing freely as a result of his own efforts.

      Here's a short character analysis test in which I took. I found it in Mr.Lau's blog, the URL's in his blog, lazy to paste it here, lol.........          You're    the United Nations!      Most people think you're ineffective, but you are trying to    completely save the world from itself, so there's always going to be a long    way to go. &nbsp;You're always the one trying to get friends to talk to each    other, enemies to talk to each other, anyone who can to just talk instead of    beating each other about the head and torso. &nbsp;Sometimes it works and sometimes    it doesn't, and you get very schizophrenic as a result. &nbsp;But your heart    is in the right place, and sometimes also in New York.   face="Times New Roman">Take the  urlLink Country  Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid

      I think i should start updating my blog much more regularly. My birthday is on friday and quite alot of people would be celebrating it, chin han, woon han, ben, XY, Pris, Stella as well as many others, planning to go sakae sushi chiong. I've seriously never had a real birthday celebration in my entire life, real as in, like.........i mean, real...........This year would probably be the first, with so many people and all. And yah, i've injured my pinky on my left hand, so that means no guitar for probably a good part of this week, i played piano just now, still pretty okay, cos' i gotta bend my pinky more for guitar...............and this injury is pretty irritating, not to mention painful at times, i have to bathe with my right hand most of the time......only when bo pian then use the left.   Hmm, i can seriously say that my "gan chu" (感触) for this week has not been really alot. I've not really been thinking about logical stuff or really had much experiences where my love life is concerend. In short, my week has been pretty mediocre at best. And also that bloody sun, expect us to copy 5 ke within one day with a physics test on the next day.............in the end no one copy.........expected,........he still thinks that teaching in China is the same as teaching in Singapore.  Yah, come to think of it, for my subject combination, i may be thinking of dropping to sub science, i don't think I can cope that well in pure science. My physics is relatively ok, but my chem is killing me. Besides, stories where pure science students drop to sub-science and got A1s for their O's is pretty encouraging. I think my school kinda sucks. The best class is more science-focused. If I could, i'll probably take E-lit, Pure History, combine humans., English, Chinese, Combined Science, Amaths and Emaths. I love amaths but i hate emaths.   I'm working on an essay regarding feminism now, and It'll probably be up in a few days time...........

      About my day, or my previous days. This week got Amaths and Chem tests. Chem was ok, Amaths was great got 33/40........highest lol. Went gym with XY and Gavin yesterday, other than that, nothing much lol, but lots of stuff happened this week, not about me, but with 2 other people. I can say that it affected me somewhat really, cos' i got to hear both sides of the story. And sometimes, i wonder what would happen if i was in his shoes, how would I feel, I think i would really feel terrible. Ok, pretty abstract stuff there, cos' there has to be a certain level of confidentiality lol. And somehow it also affected on the way I've communicated with her.  AHHHH, i've got nothing to write about my days............ok.......

      I was in an intellectual mood and I decide to talk about religion. Imo, the day when religion stops questioning itself is the day when religion dies out. Applies to christianity too, i don't believe that "christianity is not a religion, but a relationship with God" kinda thing. Christianity is a relationship with God, but also, it IS a religion, no point trying to make it sound nice by doing away with the "r" word. Sure, Buddhism is a "state of mind", not a religion, go figure.......What is the nature of God again? Back to ontology here. God is analogous to the moon, the nature of god that is. The moon is never-changing in form and shape. The moon today is the same moon 6 million years ago. But however, its manifestations is ever changing. A crescent moon? A half-moon? A full-moon?  I guess I've mentioned this point in previous posts, but also another characteristic of the moon. The moon is 3-diemensional in nature. God's mind moves in vectors, with magnitude and direction, but the human mind moves in scalars, uni-directional, with only an understanding of magnitude. We, on the Earth can only see the moon in 2-diemensional proportions. The 2-diemensional human mind would never be able to comprehend and understand the 3-diemensional nature of God. This is the same for organized religion, the reason why there are so many religion is because of the worship of the different manifestations of the same God. (Judaism, Christianity and Islam can be a very good example).  There would never be a full-revelation of God. No religion will ever have a full-revelation of God. The most a religion can see is a full-moon, but it is still partial revelation of God. To claim that a religion possesses the full revelation of God and that it is 100% "correct" is pure arrogance. However, such a nature of the human mind, its 2-diemensional nature has not gone unnoticed by God. God works and reveals himself in the context of our 2-diemensional mind. But with all humility, we have to accept our religions as being 2-diemensional in nature, and not yet possessing the full, 3-diemensional revelation of God. Even if we do, I doubt if the human mind has the ability to comprehend it.  Done with my opinion on religion, more of a philosophical perspective rather than sociological one.

      I've not updated my blog for a long time, that's because I've been busy, academically and socially, we celebrated Stella's Birthday on last Thursday and it was not bad, ate tim sum buffet and all, actually, imo, of all birthdays i still find mine the most fun lol. Cos' the crowd was bigger and it was like everyone was in a much better mood.........Thursday can actually be said to be a very memorable day to me, cos' I've bared my heart out to 3 people spontaneously, in the first time of my life. XY, Stella and WH. The details shall be witheld here. And these few weeks have been more or less emotional weeks. But nonetheless, its still pretty happy weeks. I can't really say much in this blog, even though i've got tons of things to say really.   My intellectual tank has been running low, but my emotional tank is running high. I've been getting into J-pop lately, Ayumi and DAI, respectively, someone recommended me a list of J-rock bands and i should really check them out someday except for the Kazaa which somehow lags up my whole comp. So, gotta depend on WH for Jap stuff now. And I've just learnt the intro for Tao Ze's Pu tong peng you, not easy man, cos' i suck at fingerstyle. But, can tell that there's a certain technical level involved and the chords are pretty complex, almost jazz i tell you, that guy's talented, even though he suck at the guitar lol. I've just gotten new strings for electric. changed everthing, GHS, super steels, its meant to be the brightest of all GHS', in tone of course. My guitar's now playing very well, and i've had the ball ends on the headstock, so i wun have to spend the hassle rremoving them, saw one guy in UG doing that, SV 300, lol....  But as for school-wise, i've realized one thing after not going to school this tuesday, I am really, very optimistic about going to school really, i think this year is one of the best years yet, in my school life that is. I thought Sec 2 was great, but now, I think its better. In fact, if you ask me, I prefer my weekdays then my weekends. This tuesday totally sucked, i was damn bored at home, spent most of the time sleeping, talked to WH on MSN at night, cos' I NEED CONVERSATION !!!, esp. with those people in school, XY couldn't come online, they 2 are now competing in the league table of my history of MSN conversations, both of them all stand at 3+ MB. I don't think I'll write anything intellectual today, (Rina?, ur comp is spoilt yea i noe, but i'll try to write something, when i've got inspiration that is......).  I've also been listening to some satch lately, and I can say i've really been inspired to play guitar all over again. Improving my technique and learning new stuff, but right now, not much time, so I can't really do that. Alot of things are brewing in my class, lots of stuff, but I won't say here. I'm starting to like physics more, really, and at the same time, hating chem more. Just got loads of DT this week, but i can say all went pretty well, maybe except for Emaths. Which most probably my marks would hover around the B-C range, as for the rest, i can say it went pretty well. Seriously, i actually don't have monday blues anymore, and its like, I don't dread mondays. Yea............my life right now is at its up point, up......  Intellectually, I've not been challenged lately, and neither have I read any new stuff............so nope, like I said, no intellectual posts........and Rina, if you're reading this, its like, we need to talk man, I need a mentor, WH told me you wrote the INTRODUCTION where liberty (social liberty if i'm not wrong?) is concerned, and this introduction, happened to be as thick as his file (or so he said.) And really, i need a mentor man, u can be one.........seriously............  :) that's all for today

      Ok, i shant talk about my week, but I shall give a brief hypothesis on Evolution and creationism. The design argument basically states that there is a omni-(scient, potent, present et cetra et cetra) God who created this whole Earth. Looking around, no, not everything biologically on this Earth is perfect. Look at the human eye for example. It is built upside down. With the light we recieve having to go through the fluids, cells, etcetra. And this cells and fluids are necessary for the eye to stay "alive". But the light sensitive rods are at the end of this fluids, cells et cetra. And all this fluids, cells somehow block the pathway of the light to reach these light-sensitive rods which translated the light into neural impulses for the brain to translate into images. So why aren't the light sensitive rods built nearest to the outer part of the eye?? This showcases imperfect design as well as many other examples.  But the validity of the design argument is still very difficult to refute, the calculated 10^120 chance in which the universe would come about as a strong testement to this. So what is my hypothesis?? EVOLUTION EXISTED AND IT IS CREATED BY GOD. That is my hypothesis. The 6 day period of genesis may not be 6 24 hour periods. But as some "old earth" theorists and many geologists which have affirmed this. The 6 "day" period may be close to 6 billion years. When Genesis chapter 1 states that God created the "winged creatures" and "fishes in the sea". There is a possibility that these "winged creatures" may not be the cute little birdies u see outside ur window. It may be the archeopteryx, or dinosaur birds, which evolved into cute little birdies u see today. And the "beasts on the Earth" may well be T-rexes which evolve. I don't believe that Dinosaurs died out, I believed that they evolved. Yeah through natural selection, some died out........and some evolved.   I believe that geological evidence is hard to deny and its pretty hard to refute the "old earth" theory. I believe that both creationism and evolution have both their truths and fallacies. Its "Abrupt appearance" v.s "Gradual appearance". I believe that God set the first seeds of evolution in motion, and from there he orchestrated it, God created the railway for the train of evolution to move on. What is the answer for this seemingly "imperfect" design of the human eye as well as many others?? Imo, it is simply one word, INTELLIGENCE. Humans are not the only race which have such intellectual capability. Who knows? Maybe some race in the prehistoric era had a significant intellectual level, maybe not as advanced as us. And like how we're messing up our Earth with pollution and all.  From here, this somehow warps the railway track a little. And cause a little "imperfection" in this seemingly perfect design of evolution from God. I'll maybe elaborate on this sometime later........when I've done more questioning, thinking and research

      I'm thinking of embarking on something intellectual on today's entry, but I think I'll go poetic.........I wrote this all on my computer monitor, no written draft, a first, really........    Sunny Surreal     The sunlight warms the land, warms my heart. Thermal expansion, physical decompression. But the rays of this sun, so surreal, I can never comprehend. I have remembered when the sun turned away, My presence, it treated with condescend. Like the sun at 7 in the morning, Thawing away the cold last night.  For she is like the morning sun, warm but surreal. The landscape she colours, like a photograph in sepia. But the sunlight is not only for me alone, Am I selfish to ask for all of this warmth? She is, after all, the sun, must I share its rays with all?  A long ardous climb, up the stairway to the sun. My limbs bruised by jealousy, my face bleeding with rejection. I seek healing from the morning sun, and she gave me some. For the first time, I no longer conversed at the grass. Our laughter mingled, our voices entertwined, amidst mists so ethereal. Communication sublime, all actions subtle.  But the real meaning before the full stop, I can never fully grasp. Up among the clouds, where melancholy is passe, But trends which go one full circle is what I truly fear.  Please do not banish me back to the Earth, For I do not want to climb this stairway to heaven all over again

      Bush's Religious Language by Juan Stam  George W. Bush began to take part in a Bible study group in 1985, after two decades of binge drinking. For two years he studied the Scriptures and put his heavy drinking behind him. In that same process, he succeeded in refocusing his life, which had been diffused and confused, into a coherent cosmic vision--or ideology--which corresponded to the mentality of the conservative evangelicals of his country.   When Bush decided to run for office, political strategist Karl Rove helped him make the link with the evangelical sector. While other candidates were discussing polemical themes, Rove advised him that it was much better for him to simply speak about his faith. Bush presented himself as "a man with Jesus in his heart." When a reporter asked him who his favorite philosopher was, Bush replied: "Christ, because he changed my heart." That corresponded perfectly to the extreme individualism of fundamentalism, and it constituted what in the metalanguage of evangelical code words is called "personal witness."   Politically, Bush's discourse has been very effective, but theologically the results have been more problematic, as evident in particular in three areas.     Manicheism   This ancient heresy divides all of reality in two: Absolute Good and Absolute Evil. The Christian church rejected Manicheism as heretical many centuries ago. But on the day after 9/11, the President first stated the position he would continue to maintain: "This will be a monumental struggle of good versus evil, but good will prevail." Later Bush defined his enemies as the "axis of evil," a term that is theologically and morally loaded.   Given that state of sublime innocence in his own country, like Adam and Eve in paradise, Bush can muster only one explanation for the terrorists' hatred of his nation: "There are people who hate freedom." In other words, they are so evil that they abhor the good because it is good. (But if the terrorists hate freedom, why have they not attacked Canada, which in some respects is more democratic than the United States? Why is there not the same hatred for Switzerland, Holland or Costa Rica?)     Messianism   When Bush, then Governor of Texas, decided to seek the presidency, he described his decision in terms evangelicals would understand as a divine mandate: He had been "called," a phrase that evoked the prophetic commissions of the Hebrew scriptures. He summoned to the governor's mansion all the leading pastors of the region to carry out a ritual of "laying on of hands," a practice that corresponds above all to ministerial ordination. He told the pastors that he had been called (obviously, by God) to be the presidential candidate. This language of divine calling has been frequent in his declarations and at a much accelerated rhythm since September 11, 2001.   In his State of the Union address the following year, Bush reaffirmed that "history has called America and our allies to action." Soon after the 9/11 attacks, speaking to a joint session of Congress, he proudly declared that "the advance of human freedom--the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time--now depends on us." As he declared in his 2003 State of the Union address, the nation must go forth to "confound the designs of evil men," because "our calling, as a blessed country, is to make the world better." "Once again," Bush announced as war preparation was building up, "this nation and our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility...and we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country."   Bush does not seem to have much hesitation in identifying God with his own project. In a speech in September 2002, Bush cited a Christological text in reference to his war project: "And the light [America] has shone in the darkness [the enemies of America], and the darkness will not overcome it [America shall conquer its enemies]." When he appeared in a flight suit aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, he said to the troops: "And wherever you go, you carry a message of hope--a message that is ancient and ever new. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, 'To the captives, come out! to those who are in darkness, be free!'"     Manipulation of Prayer   True prayer does not pretend to tell God what we want Him to do but rather asks that God tell us what He wishes us to do. We do not pray in order to enlist God in our ranks but to examine ourselves, to change and to do God's will. Therefore, the confession of sin and repentance are crucial moments in prayer and worship. Prayer has played a role without precedent in the Bush presidency and in the propaganda of the evangelicals who support him. Photos of Bush at prayer are common. Great publicity was given to the fact that during a prime-time news conference shortly before his speech giving the ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, Bush asked his advisers to leave him alone for ten minutes. In evangelical symbolism, that meant that a man of prayer was going to commune with God, somewhat like Moses on Mount Sinai.   It is remarkable how closely Bush's discourse coincides with that of the false prophets of the Old Testament. While the true prophets proclaimed the sovereignty of Yahweh, the God of justice and love who judges nations and persons, the false prophets served Baal, who could be manipulated by the powerful. Karl Marx concluded that religion is "the opium of the people." But Marx never knew committed Christians like Camilo Torres of Colombia, Oscar Arnulfo Romero of El Salvador, Frank Pais of Cuba, Ernesto Cardenal of Nicaragua, Dietrich Bonhoeffer of Germany or Martin Luther King Jr. of the United States. How paradoxical, and how sad, that the President of the United States, with his heretical manipulation of religious language, insists on proving Karl Marx right.

      http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&issue=soj0309&article=030910  damn bush, i hate him. Religion, has no place in politics. What is my belief?  A godly society is not exactly a christian one.  Our aim as christians is not to convert our society, to evangelize to it, and to make it more "christian". In fact, I am against christian governance, or any religious one for the matter. You give me a vote, I'll vote for any party which is secular. Maybe i'll just address christianity specifically. I would never want to be under a christian government, unless it is progressive, pluralistic and inclusive. Politics should remain secular, and no whiff of christianity should be in any government policy.  I am by no means a radical christian. I do not consider myself a radical christian. This is why I do not approve of street witnessing. Our aim as christians is to transform society into a godly one, not a christian one. A godly one is where moral values are upheld, where pluralism remains, where Christianity has the same status as any other religion and is viewed as their equal. What about the Abu Gharib Totures?   Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Christian or not. It corrupts you. That's bush. In fact, I'm a supporter of the Iraq war, Saddam should be ousted. But only one problem, Bush is in charge. You can be a christian but say that the totures are wrong, but as long as you view christianity as superior. And then suddenly you're in control of thousands of nuclear ICBMs and the world's most powerful army under your hands, coupled with the belief that "God has placed you here at this place at this time for a purpose". Try seeing whether you'll blow up this planet or not because of your bigotry.  The president's faith, wrote Klein, "does not give him pause or force him to reflect. It is a source of comfort and strength but not of wisdom."  Try mixing religion and politics, it makes you dumb. nuff said.

      Well, I've got no school tomorrow, partially the reason why I'm staying up at 11:30 to blog. Well, SAs are all done. Everything went pretty well, except for Emaths paper 2 and amaths paper 1, not that I'm weak in maths, but surprisingly chinese and chem went pretty well. I'm really very tired, but I'm trying to see how punk it can be to stay up till this hour, while most people my age would have their eyes half-open at 6 tomorrow. Aside from that, I hardly brief you (the reader) on my life inside here, because now I'm in an intellectual mood, so no time for that.  I've been reading. One book, it chronicles the discoveries of people trying to find the real age of the world. And I really can identify myself with some of the guys mentioned. My stand towards "creation science" has been very much darwinist, but more towards theistic leanings. I think I've done a post on this a while back. I have been very much influenced by Rene Descartes, he is, after all, the first darwinist. (that idiot just put his name, no intellectual property rights at Descartes' time.) Descartes' brand of darwinism or evolutionary creation is very much theistic, and is very much in line with what I believe.  Descartes likened the Earth and God as a clockmaker and his clock. Like the watchmaker analogy I mentioned earlier. God created a clock, but the clock functions by itself, yes, the source is God, but the clock is self-operational, this process in which the clock operates is characterized by cycles. But clocks are static, they move in a predictable, fixed pattern just like a never-ending cycle. There is one flaw about this analogy though, (well, analogies basically aid in delivery nothing more.) is the fashion in which time moves. I have already given up hope (for the time being) to pursue this branch of metaphysics, because we can never truly define the nature of time, and besides, human beings are pattern-seeking creatures, we tend to seek and derive patterns, for something random or otherwise. While I cannot support any hypothesis on time (not that I have any at the moment.), we can never truly define the ontology of time.  Ok, after digressing a little, let's back on track. How is the relationship with the clock and the clockmaker? What characterizes a clock are cycles. But what characterizes the Earth? Evolution, evolution characterizes the pattern in which Earth moves. Going back into the ontology of time, well, I can say that it is evolutionary and that's all. Anthropological and paleontological findings would nonetheless prove this to be so. I don't believe in abrupt creation and appearance, neither do I believe that God fashioned the Earth. God created a mechanism for the Earth and the universe for it to fashion by itself. What characterizes my stand on creation theology and natural philosophy?    God did not create the universe in its finest detail but instead, he created a mechanism which allows the universe, including our Earth to create itself, which included the finest details.    I have to reiterate my stand here, in no way is my stand atheistic. Creating a mechanism in which the Earth and universe would create itself is definitely more difficult that creating the Earth by itself. Natural or seemingly unnatural or coincidental phenomena used to explain the creation of the universe is in now way accidental. It is part of a thought out mechanism and this mechanism is designed by an intelligent creator. The universe is like a clock, it moves and functions by itself without any interference with the clockmaker whatsoever. Sure, the clockmaker detects flaws in it and corrects it if it poses a threat to the operation of the entire mechanism.  Natural counter-arguments to the design argument are simply highlighting the rusts and the little bit of decolouration or corrosion in the cranks of the mechanism. I don't believe that God intended for the world to be perfect. Maybe I'll elaborate this if I get into aesthetics. And one more thing I have to highlight. About the bible and creationism. By no means I take the blibical account of creation to be literal. It is simply metaphorical, not as some "moral lesson". But I'm an old earth believer. By stating the creation account to be literal, it is setting yourself up against all accounts of paleontology and biology. The blibical account corresponds with humanist theories of creation, most notably evolution, while the validity of human "creation is still being hotly debated, even within me right now.    And also, some christians do state that the bible talks about the roundness of the Earth. But really the belief that the Earth is flat is in fact some Newtonian bullshit (yes, that guy who came up with gravity thought the Earth was flat, try telling your physics teacher that....), among many others which only led people to believe that the Earth is flat, only for a brief period in history. A great part of Europe believed in that, save for Paris which was progressive in its intellectual pursuits. But people thought the Earth as round before that and after Columbus. The calculation of pi can prove this. The Israelites, Babylonians as well as people around the Middle eastern region especially were searching for the value of pi. And part of this search included finding the diameter of the Earth, or in their cases estimation. Guess what? The Israelites trailed the furthest back with pi=3, while their counterparts had more accurate calculations, 3.1, 3.12 and the like. The bible is by no means a reliable account for natural philosophy, really, or maybe it boils down hermeneutics.  The earth evolved, God did not create the Heavens and the Earth, he indirectly created it. But more accurately, he created a mechanism to facilitate its creation. That's what I believe, and this mechanism is governed by the laws of nature, of physics and the like.

      This is my first, and probably my last, (or maybe you won't see one in a long time) theological argument. I'm talking theology here, so if you're non-christian you won't probably be interested. But its about homosexuality and the church, so if you are interested, feel free to post your comments.  While I think homosexuality is wrong, well, it presents some problems to God when he wanna do some population control, just like the Singapore government  . But I have to state something. If you had to choose, and you have to choose, a habitual liar or a homosexual as a pastor, who would more likely get the job? Probably the liar. It is really what I deem as the prioritization of sins.   God killed Ananias and Sapphira for lying, as well as Sodom and Gomorrah. The bible do not prioritize sins over one another, saying one is more serious, and another as less serious. It does say homosexuality is an abomination, but it promises the "digging out of the eyes by vultures" to those who do not honour their father and mother. The church as a whole do have a greater tolerance for other forms of sins, but not homosexuality.   As for the whole Sodom and Gomorrah issue. I think its not homosexuality but rather sexual immorality. Judging from the way their sexual lifestyles went, I believe that God will still judge them even if it was heterosexual. Many homosexuals today, especially those involved in relationships. They tend to be under much social, cultural and religious scrutiny, so their relationships tend to be very much wholesome and well-taken care of.   In fact, many homosexual couples out there do serve as examples of healthy romantic relationships. Not saying that heterosexual ones aren't exemplary but gay ones have the trust, communication etc. essential to any romantic relationship, and it is healthy, if this relationship is replicated into a heterosexual one. Homosexual couples in modern societies differ greatly from those in Sodom and Gommorah.   No doubt, homosexuality is a sin, but I believe a heterosexual relationship plagued by lying isn't any better than a homosexual relationship with truthfulness. Like I said, homosexuality is just like any other sin, like lying. God does not play favourites, sin is sin. No big no small sins. I do not like the way how homosexuality is elevated as a big sin, while lying and other "small" ones go unnoticed.

      My mood has been far from intellectual lately, but really, could because of the exams. I decided to write something, about cloning essentially, but what I intend to expound on is the relevance of the church in modern society. What constitutes religious revival and decline.   I actually noticed this thread quite a while back but after flipping through the pages of this forum, well, i decided to write something. I don't know much about the biological technicalities of cloning. But really, epistemologically speaking, it is only a matter of time when "perfect" cloning is attained, as in cloning where there would be no diseases or side effects to the guy who got cloned.   Well, morally speaking, and as a Christian, I see no wrong in cloning. Are men playing God? I don't think so. To me it is simply an alternative avenue for reproduction. I mean, God does not magically pops out babies out of nowhere. Sexual reproduction involves the willingness of 2 parties (and in some unfortunate cases, 1..) to have intercourse in order to reproduce. There is a human element to it, and it can be biologically explained. Are humans playing God through sexual reproduction? Why not pray for God to send a baby to your doorstep?! Aren't we creating babies through sexual reproduction, and aren't we also creating babies, except its identical through cloning?   Sexuality has always been an important part of human life and it will continue to be so, it would take a very long time or it may not even happen at all for cloning to overtake sexual reproduction. As long as people persist in cloning research, there would be breakthroughs in it, and successful cloning would be possible. I don't see how is cloning playing God. If God created the land and solid ground for us to stand on, then I can say that Singapore has quite alot of explaining to do as to why it is "playing God" by reclaiming land. Maybe Jurong Island can be the next tower of Babel.   Don't think that technology which somehow is fantastic, and which brings things which we think is in the realm of the impossible (ie. in the realm of God) and bring it down to Earth, such as cloning, it is necessarily pride and "playing God". Well, that is the case of Galilee, the heavens, to the church at that time was something unexplainable and when Galilee came and put something so "out of this world" to them into simple terms, they all went berserk. Well, don't be like the church at that time, denying things out of religious pride, only to be proven wrong a few decades down the road.   Just a side note, ultimately, if the church wants to prove it is relevant in this society. Being in fashion and in vogue is not enough. Culture not only entails fashion, but it also entails values, beliefs and technology. Being hip and cool is nothing short of superficial. Churches should always seek to question extensively the values and beliefs of their culture and adopt those which are complementary to the christian faith, but at the same time be a powerful and strong critic of beliefs which are contrary to our faith. Instead of using rhetoric, we need to prove to be a formidable critique of certain cultural beliefs and norms. The secular world cannot be won over by the bible, and neither can they be won over through rhetoric.  Churches should participate in active dialogue with members of the intellectual community, especially with those of the human sciences. Religion has found increasing compatibility with the physical sciences, with probably evolution as the exception. It is social principles and norms which threaten the credibility of the ecclesial institution. Christian cannot afford to degrade into a form of casual determinism and a collection of arbitrary assumptions. I shall highlight what I believe the church needs to stay relevant from a sociological and philosophical standpoint, and not a theological one.  That one coming up soon, intending to write a full-sized paper.

      Can God a create a stone which he cannot lift? well, actually, no, here's why.  we're talking philosphy here so it can get kinda abstract.   Why do we say that God is good, why don't we say God is the best? Well, best is the limit of good. And, by saying God is the best, we are saying God is limited. Well, a misconception is that God is so great and very very great until it borders to the realm of the limitless. Is pluto really that far? For us it is, but for people 50 years later its nothing more than 5 bus stops away.   How do you define heavy? If you say that God creating a stone so heavy he cannot lift. You are saying God is creating the heaviest stone using the most powerful might to lift it. But how heavy is heavy and how powerful is powerful? God doesn't operate in the realm of limits. This stone which god has created, its mass and weight can be measured. No matter how fantastic this measure is, it is still possible to measure it. Given time, a human being would be able to recreate this heavy stone. Given more time, biologists would be able to create some drug which would make us able to lift it. Epistemologically speaking, God has given us an ever-expanding intelligence, (dr. Ar Bernard talked about this once).   God doesn't work in heavy, difficult, those are terms of limitations. these terms do not exist with God. The creation of the universe is not the best God can do, the stone which God can create won't be the heaviest he can create, the power which God uses to lift the stone would never be the most powerful. There is nothing God can do which would make him the best, it is impossible for God to reach the best, because human beings operate with a ceiling of limitation, once the ceiling is reached, we have reached our best no matter how high that ceiling is, it is still limitation, but God operates without that ceiling of limitation, thus, God can never be the best, and God can create a stone so heavy, but he can still lift it, with reasons mentioned above.

      Well, school's back, so its back to everything that I once knew. But somewhat, I feel that I've started a new term and a new life all over again. Its wierd, spooky, uncertain. That's what it is. In a sense it is new, in a sense it is not. Yes yes, I'm at it again, maybe the tagline for this blog shall be "getting metaphysical on your ass". But anyway, let's get back on track. And is there any track to begin with lol. Sometimes, when I feel lost, I just simply start a new post here, and who knows what I'm gonna write.  Listening to "Fly away" by Liang Jing ru, its amazing though. How I got into chinese pop into the first place. I was a "see ang moh kao". Literally translated as a dead caucasian dog. But anyway, putting it into context is a totally different thing. I just bought her album, the "lian ai de li liang' one. I mean, it was NOT an objective, rational. Ok....I've got 20 bucks, there is this CD then this CD so I'll get this. Nah, its more like, uhhhh, just get this CD, where can I get 20 bucks?  For the first time, I've bought a CD using my heart instead of my head. And really, I did not consider whether there is adequate 'musical fusion' or uhhhh, 'auditory colouration' or maybe have kickass guitar solos. No, what touched me is the sincerity. Her musicians may not be the best around, heck, it has neither musical fusion nor auditory colouration. But yea, music is always best when you can relate to it. She has influenced me alot as a person, I can say, maybe not as a musician. And yea yea corny but it has helped me tide over some difficult periods. And maybe some of you are familiar with these "difficult periods" as I have said.  Its very situational, and the songwriting's relatively good. English pop is mostly crap. American industry money-spinning shit. Yea, the chinese pop world have their own fair share of such people. F4? But there are some people out there who can really make songs which move you.   Love, love, lemme talk about it. Someone once said Love is like a golden shackle in a cushioned birdcage. Uhhhh actually you don't have to figure out exactly who said it, cos' I came up with it lol. Anyway, I have learnt quite a bit (understatement perhaps). I may feel the liberation, the fact that I'm kinda out of the birdcage, but there's one thing I lack, security. The security which I had in the past. The security that there's always someone I can depend on, I can run to when I feel down and out. I'm not saying that its a bad thing, nah, its actually pretty ambivalent if you look at it. What do you want? Freedom or security.  But realizing that there's someone I can run to. But also, my heart's not with me. My heart's not mine, I can't control it, my emotions, sometimes its hard to mask it and it shows. Sure, there's security but I find myself sharing all problems and joys which are not mine. Of course, it is a sacred and wonderful thing, but if applied in the right context.   I don't wish to elaborate more........but as school's starting and my mind starts to work, expect more posts here.   :)

      Those in bold italics are that guys words, others are mine. Regarding Feminism, a dialogue, our final one. We had it in 3 parts.    Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Socialism is egalitarian but doesn't make use of people's talents effectively. So-called "equal opportunity" laws also in fact interfere with making use of people's talents. They don't let you hire the person you think will be best. Paying people different salaries and hiring them in any other way than running a lottery is anti-egalitarian but it improves use of talents.    Actually, the system or ideology which I actually described is not really close to socialism at all, but rather its the principle of meritocracy. Socialism is really what I like to call “shoving egalitarianism down people’s throats,” and of course, this causes much indigestion. The comparison of these two systems can be very much analogous to a race. Meritocracy, basically does not care what’s your background or status, meritocracy ensures everybody is at the same starting line, and that everyone goes at the same time the gun sounds. As for the race, it is up to the athlete’s will and physical ability and endurance to complete it and win the 1st place. What about socialism? Socialism basically says that everyone must win! And that everyone crosses the finish line together. But winning is never really winning until someone loses. However, if your principle of social differentiation is applied in this analogy, there won’t be any race at all, the outcome is pre-determined anyway!  That’s what I meant by egalitarianism is what enables societies to make use of talents more effectively. I actually meant to say meritocracy rather than egalitarianism, as egalitarianism is too broad a term. Meritocracy rewards a person on the merit he or she achieves and the nature of that merit and assigns that person to a particular social role, rather than assigning that person to the social role from his/her sex, race etc. etc.    Depends on what you mean by human beings. Fire preceeded modern human mental abililties, and homo sapiens has always used fire. Also, the fact that there have been radical unprecedented changes doesn't show that  any particular radical unprecedented change will happen or be beneficial. Such changes remain extremely unlikely until they actually happen.    Actually my disbelief of universalism is very much philosophical. I believe that even if a particular situation or belief can be described as having the ability to change, even hypothetically, it basically proves that it has ability to change in accordance with time or with the environment. When it does not change, it simply means that it refuses to use that ability. But since, it has been proven as having the ability to change in a hypothesis, it is proof that the ability is there, and thus it can be regarded as non-universal.  (it’s a little confusing, its philosophy anyway lol .)  And also, on whether the changes are beneficial or not. The “changes” I was referring to is really to the environment and circumstances around us. Not the change of ideology where gender is concerned. I never believe in positive or negative changes where the environment is concerned. It’s the way we respond to that change which makes it positive or negative.    Sex has been around about a billion years. I agree that over that  period it's had varying effects on behavior. Still, a prediction that the effects of something so fundamental to life as the effects of sexual differences is not just going to change but become irrelevant seems unlikely. I have no idea why I should believe it.    There is a gender divide and difference no doubt. But what really constitutes the majority that divide? Is it human and social expectations or is it the very nature of humans itself? I agree that sex has always been fundamental to human life. But what makes us think that it WILL be fundamental to human life. A billion years can be long or short, depending on your perspective. Using my sushi and fish-and-chips analogy, sushi has basically been the very cornerstone of Japanese cuisine, but is it right for a Japanese chef to not know the art of making sushi and set up a fish-and-chips restaurant? I think so.   Gender is basically like race, we thought that race do determine our character and attributes. But in fact, race simply INFLUENCES our character and attributes. The same goes for gender. (look at my Mozart analogy).    Why think it's right for this day and age? Also, if everything changes in time why shouldn't things change by place or situation or among individuals? How do you know that even if feminism is right for you in your situation right now it's not wrong for others and won't become wrong for you in the not-so-distant future?    Why do I feel that feminism is the right ideology for this day and age? Simple, Confucianism and a hierarchal structure is becoming increasingly outdated in our time. A simple gauge is the evolution of our economy, to survive in the new economy; companies diversify and companies value workers which are versatile. Workers know that they have to take up new courses and chalk up work experience outside their field of expertise, in case there’s a downturn in their industry and they lose their jobs.   No one has “fixed’ roles in our society anymore. I have seen people turning from office-worker to homemaker to investor to businessman all in the span of less than six months, insurance agent by day, taxi-driver by night, stock-broker by day, and pimp by night. These are very common scenes in our modern society.   Even if you know that certain pockets of society do have fixed roles, our socio-economic structure is certainly moving towards that direction.    So you're saying that people have a fixed nature.    A vector quantity is a quantity which has both magnitude and direction. What I’m saying is that people are born with individual characteristics not influenced by sex or race. But however, it is society and social norms and expectations which actually serve to either nullify or develop their potential. And soon, people conform to what society expects of them in accordance to their sec or race.    The short-changing of talents would be much less common than in your belief of gender non-differentiation, which is the belief that roles should  always be completely identical for men and women.  There are always social roles. Why does it lead to a better fit if the roles have to be exactly the same for men and women instead of varying by sex?    I believe that you have completely missed my point. I never believe in totally homogenous social roles, but rather inter-changeable ones. I am not against a “caste” system in general, but I am against a rigid one. Our society has to be flexible, we are no more living in the past where major changes happen every few generations or so, major changes happen in less than a decade. As the environment changes, society has to move to accommodate the change.  I have never said that men and women should switch roles. If people think that’s the underlying ideology of feminism, then they’re very much ill-informed, Feminism is about flexibility. It is the ability to choose the social role one wishes to take up without any coercion, subliminal or otherwise.

      I'm not going to bash anybody or anything now. Just bashed someone over the issue of mormonism. And my previous posts have been pretty uhhhh, "bashful". I shall be more upfront now, talk about my life, my dreams goals stuff like that. My life right now has pretty much hit a transition, a time where I feel like I have to move on with things. Quite abit of things, even though spurred on by recent friendships and love, it goes beyond just simply on a inter-personal or relational level.  I'm at a point when I feel that I would like to discover more of the world, more of myself. I do not want to put myself in a box, because I haven't seen the different boxes which i can confine myself in, and I cannot make an objective decision, just like communist china, I can't see the world and more of it unless I get to see the different boxes which I can confine myself in, and soon, it won't be confinement, but security. Yea yea, I'm getting metaphysical on your ass, so whatever.   My love life is yet another story, private, so I won't elaborate, only to those whom I told my stuffs to only. And if you are not one of them, don't worry, you're pretty normal, there are 6 billion minus uhhhh a few people, whom are like you.  Relationally, I've actually learnt to communicate with people on a more deeper level, thanks to a few people for helping me, and teaching me how to open up. I realize that hanging out is great, but being able to share your life with people is even greater.   As for my dreams and ambitions, i do have a few, actually I'm quite interested in visual arts and hope to learn how to do surreal or abstract paintings someday. and its like, someday, not anytime soon. Intellectually, I hope to read more and hopefully write full-sized essays and crystallize all my thoughts and ideas, and would like to master the fundamentals of sociology before the end of this year, I wanna go bash people. And musically, as for guitar, I definitely hope to play better. Master the pentatonic scale and all the major modes by the end of this year as well. Brush up on my alternate picking, and at least be able to do some decent shred. as for piano, I intend to learn more chords, scales theory, more songs, be able to improvise in different styles and timing.   As for the long term, I intend to go to JC, (poly is still fine). Take an arts course and do a degree in Sociology, hopefully in a local U. Afterwards becoming a teacher. That's the mainstream stuff, y'noe Singaporean get a degree get a job kinda thing. But i also intend to teach guitar, and gain street cred, performing in watering holes, anywhere. Also, I would like to be a recognized authour, street cred is important yet again, and hopefully gain some as an undergrad in the U. Writing books about sociology and philosophy, and also hope to educate normal people, and break complex social and philosophical theories down to bite-sized pieces much later after I've established myself. Which i hope my training and experience as a teacher can help.  I hope that it would take root among young people around my age, because such stuff works wonders, if you're into chemistry or physics, its called being a nerd imo of course. If you're into sociology, philosophy and all, it gives you insight on everyday life, and its much more practical. It also helps you to mature quite abit, (not trying to say I am.) But you get to understand the driving force behind MTV and pop culture, and not be a "ben xiao hai". And most importantly, people our age need some credibility, adults can con you into believing alot of crap.Soon, you can outtalk your parents in alot of stuff, seriously, it has practical uses. But if you're aware, you know what's right and wrong, and not blindly follow what a church, or your parents or whatever tell you.   You dictate your values, guided by the wisdom of God, (if you're not atheist). I'm on the brink of bashing so I'll stop. Also, where guitar is concerned, I hope to be like satch, starting out as a teacher then an artist. And soon it goes from there. But I don't intend to follow his footsteps musically because I believe individual style is most important where music is concerned.   Back to the short term, relationships. Just have the sudden urge to talk about this. Actually my previous love experience have been kinda dramatic, for me that is. And I seriously have learnt alot. It has also served as a yardstick, if any love is not as life-changing and deep, it is not love at all. I can say that my expectations of what a relationship should be like has gone up a notch or two, maybe even a hundred. Seriously, now I know how to differentiate feelings and how am I able to tell if a relationship'll work or not. Sometimes its hard to accurately predict, but there are still ambigious markers.  I have learnt a few things in this past love experience. (in fact, I'm still having it). Now, its like a hangover, but I can't guarantee that I won't go get drunk again tonight. Yea, one of the thing I have learnt is that the best person is not what matters. but rather, its the best relationship. I can't help but to scoff at people who make checklists of their dream guy and dream girl, and go after any guy/girl who happens to magically fit into it. Nah, that's one thing I learnt, its not gonna work. What matters most is a relationship with trust, communication and depth. And seriosuly, if its not gonna be like what I experienced, its 2nd best to me.   I'm not talking about romanticism or something very blatant. It can be more sedate and sublime and perhaps taking on different forms. But after all, in our hearts we would be able to gauge the amount of depth, trust and communication in every relationship. I don't think I'll indulge in any relationship for the time being, I need to relieve my days as a bachelor yet again. You don't have to be attached to be a bachelor, you're a bachelor when your heart is free and not owned by anyone, whether that person knows it or not.  ah whatever, done.

      http://www.alternet.org/story/16274  Bush is shit, time to vote him out, Kerry's not really anything fantastic, one analyst said if kerry wants to win, he attacks bush, and dun promote himself. Nothing with Kerry here. Its just the 10 lies Bush told you, and I saw a book called Bush "a man of faith" outside the church bookshop. Its gone the last time I saw, didn't know if they recalled the stock or it got sold out.  Dumb if religion takes part in politics, look, Jesus did not go meddle around with the military, he was a nice guy preaching about faith hope and love, and helping people live better lives and gain insight on their lives. No, Jesus did not have control of a thousand odd nukes with Abram tanks, talking about waging a "crusade". Jesus, was a very very nice guy, y'noe, i somewhat think Mahatma Gandhi fits the description more than Martin Luther who went and persecuted the Jews.   Nice, if the church was any more open, we would refer to Martin Luther as the founder of the protestant reformation who persecuted the Jews. He's got jew blood on his hands, maybe I'm gonna take a theological look on this, yea, he was a great man, moved in the "holy spirit", BUT HE'S GOT JEW BLOOD ! Ohhh, pop quiz, can he go to heaven? sorry, you can't use 50/50 on that. Now come on, its time to snap out of this utopianist mentality and realize how many mistakes the church had made, think that its "heaven on earth", snap out of it.  We're in this world but not of this world, huh, some think we're enclosed in some protective bubble. But wrong, we're all subject to social construction, to human faults. I mean, Jesus would have been real disspointed, he looks at Gandhi, and says, whoo, someone who is somewhat like me......the suddenly he realize that he's got a altar of Vishnu in his home.   Jesus, to me, was a feminist who believed in equality, read my 2nd post. No where in the 4 gospels did it say the "wives submit to your husbands". Take away the romantic connotations its simply, "women submit to the men". Some scholars believed that Paul did not write that because of writing style. Besides the first feminists were christian. Its sick to see how the followers of Jesus take his name and start messing it up for the world to see.  I love Jesus, hell yea, that's not even cheesy. It used to be a radical, christian, bigoted phrase, the kinda blind leading the blind kinda thing, you know what I mean. But if you look at it through what I just said, it entails an entirely different meaning. It means using plain common sense, to achieve general world peace, harmony between all of God's creation, and to strive for a better sense of well-being of God's creation. That's what I meant when i said "I love Jesus". Not a relentless, power hungry drive to establish christianity as the main and only religion.   I love Jesus has taken on a whole new meaning........

      http://www.thercg.org/books/effai.pdf  The way a christian magazine published its counter-argument on the theory of evolution riled my stomach, it awakened me to see how christians can never hope to overtake secular scientists in terms of intellectual pursuits, not because of incompetency, but rather, the denial or the half-hearted application and approach to the scientific method. For one to achieve intellectual greatness, one has to understand the fundamentals of epistemology. The religious would say it comes from God. But to me, that's no different from saying that rice comes from the padi and not focus on the sowing, harvesting treshing etc. of the crop to produce rice.  Where does knowledge come from? God (in a very broad sense)? While I do not deny that, but that alone is not enough to explain the manufacture of information, it only acknowledge its source. Galileo was a devout christian but the church kept him in his place by saying the very same thing. Intellect can never be kept in a box to feed some pre-modern determinist fallacy. To me, unless christians fully grasp the scientific method, we are simply cavemen trying to understand and argue with and about modern science, no matter how competent we may be.  The problem is in our attitude. The first word which turned my stomach is the phrase "this conclusive argument". No respectable scientist would ever put that in his paper or thesis. Arguments are never meant to be conclusive nor final, arguments are meant to be accompanied by counter-arguments, and counter-counter arguments etc. Scientific titbits do not impress the scientific community without embracing the scientific method. Science is an attitude altogether, not a study, and the scientific method is its backbone.  The second is its disgusting use of rhetoric, exclamation marks are fine if presented in a novel or storybook but never in a scientific paper. The scientific method does not entail rhetoric, only religion does. Too much shouting, and saying that "it is still amazing why evolutionists are still....!" with an exclmation mark, saying that how ludicrous evolution is. Yea yea, you said it in the last paragraph already, so just shut up and present your arguments in a more objective fashion. Ultimately, positivism is the best doctrine where scientific pursuits are concerned. Stop preaching, start thinking.  Respected scientists, instead of stamping a "This is the truth" rubber stamp on their theses, put a "This are my observations and deductions, feel free to counter-argue". Its amazing how some of these scientists have much more humility than christians themselves. Well, after all, the most religious isn't always the most moral. Christians have after all, for the past few centuries, burned "witches" at the stake and massacred the muslims. And that previous statement is an example of rhetoric, not presenting the whole truth in an objective light, even though that is the truth.  I don't see how adding scientific titbits to prove the design argument is necessary to prove the existence of God. So ok, the Earth and universe is intricately made. No need to put all that stuff inside that article, go dig up the astronomy or biology books and yea that'll fill you in. Its just simply showing off, like some peacock showing off its feathers, ohhh look, christians like us can be scientific too ! Come on, like I said, science is not a study its a method.   All the theories, especially scientific ones which are very much christian-oriented, gotta be very careful on that. Cos' no, God did not say that the Earth is 4000 years old, some guy called James Ussher did, and the church did. So don't really believe that, cos' the church has been proved wrong many many times, don't believe me? Just dig up the history books, and I don't forsee any "exceptions" in the near future. The church has been proven wrong because of its stubborness and pride, its pride to tradition and pre-modern scientific authority. Only the scientific method can save the church from this intellectual quagmire.   The best way to argue is to counter-argue and to counter-counter argue. Christians gotta learn to say "ok, you got me stumped this time, good job, I admit defeat for now, but lemme go think about it, and I'll come up with a satisfactory counter-argument." And if nothing satisfactory can be come out of it, then its time to admit defeat rethink our interpretation of the bible, its not selling-out. Any respectable scientist could do that. Even though those before the 20th century had a very hard time doing it, quite stubborn people, but still great attitudes really.

      A letter I wrote to today, Hope it gets published tomorrow.  Dear Editor, 	I referred to “Democracy’s power to obstruct” by Amit Jain (Today, June 14). I do agree with the author’s views to a certain extent but nonetheless feel that this is an insightful analysis on the current world situation.  	 I agree with his view that the US has to reduce its “missionary enthusiasm to shape the world in its own image.” Governments around the world have adopted democracy to varying degrees, from Iran to Switzerland, and the concept of democracy varies from country to country. In this sense, democracy is contextualized and that there is no one universal model being adopted. I believe that the context, in which democratic models of government are being formed, is culture. 	 The Asian subservience of Singapore calls for a different model of democracy, than say, a relatively liberal society such as the US. In this respect, I believe that a policy of cultural relativism has to be adopted, modifying what’s deemed as “pure” democracy and applying it to varying extents to better serve a particular culture, rather than changing a particular culture to fit into a supposed “exemplary” model of democracy.  Thus, I believe that unilateralism in the political re-construction of Iraq would be particularly ineffective. It would be much better if different countries take part in its political re-construction where many models and interpretations of democracy is being put on the table and is discussed extensively. Only through such dialogue and planning would a democratic model which better serves the Iraqi people and its culture be formed. Only if the association between democracy and the Stars and Striped is diminished, will the Iraqi people view democracy not as a form of political or cultural imperialism, but simply, a socio-political system worth considering and adopting.	   However, I do not agree with the author’s view that democracy in the context of elections would obstruct the fight against terror and on foreign policy as well as the view that these issues should be best left to the “experts”. Such a view, I believe, would prove especially dangerous in terror hot-spots such as Indonesia or Saudi Arabia. The mandate of the people in these places would be essential to combat terror as terror organizations prey on the dissatisfaction, poverty and ethnocentrisms of the people in these places. 	 Through rhetoric, even if few people join the ranks and file of these organizations, ordinary citizens would most probably turn into terrorist sympathizers. And for the terror groups, half the battle is already won. By trying Abu Bakar Bashir would simply mean dismantling the mechanism for terror but it would do little to weaken the will of the JI. I believe that Governments have to tackle the problem of terror ground-up, and democracy meaning “power to the people”, is especially essential. Terrorism has to be fought on the grassroots and the governmental level, if the battle is not yet won on the ideological front, the war against terror is far from over. 	 In conclusion, I believe that democracy should be tailored for the people, and not the people tailored for democracy. How the war against terror is won, or lost, hinges on how democracy is adopted and implemented.

      I've got no idea what I wanna type today. I thought I'll do full-sized papers and stuff, but what the heck. I just can't seem to type it out. I wish school is here, so that my mind would be much intellectually active. Get to see all of them again. But we're not even planning anything this June hols, no mood as they say. Don't blame them or anything, maybe their focusing on their own stuffs. This blog has really become a little derelict. No doubt about that, but I've come to the point when I don't care. Knowledge is evolutionary, progressive, but for me it has come to a halt. Here's a little something which I wrote.............     Someone wrote:     no 1 is saying that things cant 'evolve'. mayb the earth, animals do evolve over time. BUT when we talk abt evolution, the most important thing is not did the earth evolve but how did human come about! the common picture in people's mind is how apes eventually evolve into human. and that is what scientists re trying to convince the world.   the debate is not whether earth can evolve or not, the debate is did ape evolve to a man.   i thank God that some of u re very intellectual n like science very much BUT u re missing the picture when u think that christians re trying to deny science.   i dun really care whether did giraffe get such long neck due to it evolve over time bcos of environment. i only care is the world trying to deny the existence of God by labellig human as a result of random n natural selection and evolving.   sorry to insult anyone but i really think this thread is a waste of time. we shld ask ourselves what is the spirit behind a theory, a philosophy.   eg why is racism bad? the natural answer wld be it's not fair to put 1 race down. but if we think further, it is a spirit or a force to make people believe that God didnt make everyone equal and that is an insult to God's character.   why is communism bad? the natural answer wld be no freedom, people re robbed of the motivation of life. but if we think further, the biggest problem of communism is it deny God. so EVEN if there re 101 gd things abt communism, as long as if it denys God, there's no pt trying to convince me to subscribe to it.   so for those intellectuals (which i am not), for a moment, try to be more spiritually minded and see beyond ur scientific facts and ask yourself is it really of God or of the devil or is there a real subtle driving force behind such things.   if not mayb u guys can go to some science-related forum instead and find ur mental stimulations. this forum doesnt provide such a platform to do so.      I wrote:    lol, about whether the biggest problem in communism is denying God is very much arguable. Political systems have to be analyzed on a case by case basis. Well, really, what do I have to say about what you say. Things are getting about strongly-worded here so I'll try to smile  and keep things happy lol.   Well well, ok, don't worry christians are not the ONLY people who hate intellectual arguments. The common gripe is that well, you can argue the whole day but get to no where, so what's the point, just sit back and relax. Well, if everybody "sat back and relaxed", the computer you're using, the light bulb that's lighting up your room. These inventions are based on scientific principles, and these scientific principles were argued.   Take electricity for example, if say, at that time everyone believed that electricity is produced when God is angry and he sends lightning bolts down and stuff, then this guy came and tell them about electricity, and electromagnetic induction, well, an argument would ensue. Sometimes, its fortunate if a conclusion is formed in one generation, sometimes it takes a a few hundred years to formulate a sound scientific principle, after a few hundred years arguing over the same thing.   That's how human beings managed to develop because of this. It is because no one saw how "pointless" it was, or maybe some did but they kept on. Arguments cause us to learn, to think. And to ask us to stop arguing is basicallt asking us to cease learning and thinking. Simple as that. Learning is not through reading books, learning is developmental, its progressive, evolutionary, i can say. The human race progressed not because it read old books, but it has written its own books. It argued, modified what is seen as "common" knowledge. And this process naturally caused disagreements, but these disagreements are essential and are part of the learning process.   Why enclose yourself in a box? The elderly in Russia still do hold communist beliefs, if communism was more widespread, can we win the world through denying communism. Communism in this sense is rhetorical, similar in approach to christianity, it would not be difficult to change their beliefs. But what about humanism and darwinism? It is intellectual in nature, and christianity should approach it in an intellectual manner imo.   These people don't just randomly and abitrarily believe in Darwinism, but they have a REASON to do so. All the more we should give them reasons to believe in christianity and not in darwinism. Sure, you may say that God is a God of faith. But really, if God is a God of faith, why do handle hot objects carefully, why did God gave us a mechanism of pain to avoid us malhandling our body. Why can't God just take away the pain and heal us right away?   Sometimes, human beings look for a little novelty sometimes lol, God give you pain to stop you from hurting yourself, and you ask why can't God just heal you instead? And if God does it the other way round, we complain why can't God give us a mechanism to stop us from hurting ourselves. Faith doesn't mean that we are devoid of reason.   The reason why I started this thread in the first place is that i hope that christians would be more aware of intellectual threats to our faith and how to adequately counter them. I'm a little not that "christian" in my stance mostly because that's what I believe but also partly I hope that this thread would not be filled with "yes-mans", denouncing the "spirit of evolution", and when our friends argue with us about our faith, where evolution is concerned, what do we do? Pray in tongues and cast the "spirit of evolution" out of him? Well.......you can try.......   And regarding communism. Just because it denies God doesn't mean we totally deny it. Someone once said, "A dumb man believes everything he sees, the clever man believes half of what he sees, the wise man knows which half to believe". There are good points in communism such as a colletive identity, nationalism, and egalitarianism. These good points can be brought forward and applied to maybe even Singapore.   The world is filled with half-truths, sure the bible is true. But does the bible give us insight on how to run a country? Insight on scientific principles? Not really, maybe for the former, yes. But, really it is at best a few chapters of it. Marx or Freud's books would serve as better "manuals" whether you buy their theories or not. Since the world is filled with half-truths and half-goods, why not take the good out of this and that, and apply it to yourself.

      Ahhh, just about 24 hours ago, I was in suntec watching Vai and his band play. The first gig I've been to, and its great. I went with Amanda, someone I met on the net, from ultimate-guitar, the gig was not too bad. Billy Sheehan on bass, nothing short of a legend, this guy. Tony Macalpine, Dave Weiner on rhythym guitar, and some Jeremy (couldn't catch his last name), was on drums. The drummer was kinda punk without shirt, spiked hair, tatooes and looked a little young, but yea, punk have some good drummers.  They opened with some fat boy song which I didn't really know, maybe its just me, but Amanda seemed kinda bored lol. The opening was a few more faster Vai material, he shredding, stuff like that. He used DSL/TSLs not too sure which one, not the carvin legacy amps he used to use. Don't know about that though, but its good, cos' I can see that its not any mode four shit, I don't like the mode four anyway. I guess the rest of the 2, macalpine and weiner were using JCMs, if I'm not wrong, from the tone, and JCMs are more suited for rhythym.  The parts I really liked was Macalpine's piano solo, and it was awesome man, the way he play was really damn great, I can tell he improvised and he has awesome technique on the piano, really wonderful. He's also wonderful on the guitar, of course his skill is overshadowed by vai. The drummer is not too bad as well, great double bass stuff. But as for sheehan, I can appreciate keyboard, drum and of course guitar solos, but not really bass. So, I didn't really appreciate it. But I know that Sheehan does harmonics like he's just fretting notes.  Vai has many revolutionary techniques I can say, personal ones, especially his tremolo work, one thing I really really have to learn is how he manage to keep the notes articulate only using the fretting hand! Even paul Gilbert can't do that stuff, and I can say that Paul Gilbert does not really match up to any one of those who played in G3 before (I don't know if he did play in G3). But anyway, Gilbert's technique is quite ok, and his scale knowledge is not too bad, but he's still not that good. I've been using my floyd more often after that, and lowering my action. I was really inspired but I hope that this inspiration would continue.  I can now see MANY MANY flaws in my technique, including the need to use my pinky more often. I'll also start working on my piano, after seeing macalpine. The part also I liked when a Singaporean guitarist jammed with Vai onstage along Little Wing. And I can say that whenever I hear Little Wing, I start to think back to this gig, as well as anything by Vai, its the whole "Vai" vibe which brings me back thinking.  I am not that well acquainted with Vai's material as well with Satch, I know Satch's stuff more than Vai which is why I cannot catch all the songs he played, maybe except for Bad Horsie. I was actually hoping that he would play Answers and hopefully Beethoven's 5th, but he didn't but its fine, but at least he played little wing, which I was really hoping he would.  The gig's kinda long though, it was scheduled to start at 8, but it started at close to 8:15. Ended at 11. Kinda long though the gig, but I think overall, seeing Vai play in person was really worth it. The crowd actually was more of working professionals and 20 somethings. I doubt if adolescents would go though, they are all to caught up with the nu-metal shit. But yea, I can't believe they played some nu-metal CD before the gig started, ahhhhhh, crap. But anyway, this gig is a very very memorable one........really..........

      Lying on my table is a pathetic atempt at trying to solve schrodinger's equation. What can O'level student like me do? I mean, why has everything become so deflated? I look at the piano score on my keyboard, I ask, why do I play so hard for? My amp, my guitar, why do I practice so hard to fully learn all the positions of the G pentatonic. I ask, why am I doing all this? I don't know why. Maybe its just that I believe in myself? or what?  I know that whatever talent I have is still very much undeveloped, but after all, every human being has talent. Why do I work so hard? So what if one day I win the nobel prize for disconvering a safer way for nuclear power generation? What if one day if I become some grammy musician? So what? Who do I have to thank? Who can I say my thank yous to? My friends? Yea, people whom have helped me in the course of that, maybe.  What I know now is not much, I have yet to compare with people who truly understand physics, or music, or sociology or anything. But what is the drive which would make me want to achieve great things? What is the point of wanting to achieve so much when the two people central in your life cannot even drive you to want to achieve that. When they constantly remind you of your weaknesses, and never once told me to "go on, you can do it.". Have they once acknowledged what I have inside of me?  What I need most is people to spur me on, people to assure me that I can make it, I can do it, never mind if you don't know how to solve the schrodinger's equation, never mind if you don't know the 7 major modes, never mind if you can't play the piano that well. Never mind if you can't understand what Foucault has written. Never mind that, one step at a time, I know you can do it. Who has ever told that to me? No one, i can say that no one has ever done that.  Have you wondered why I've been searching for mentors in fields which I am so interested in? I am not only looking for people with superior abilities, but also people who can spur me on, to encourage me. I can never forget my motto to learning anything in life, think that you're good but not good enough. Who can I have to give me the right balance? Who can I have to be my central pillar of support?  Have the 2 central people in my life encouraged me to read more? I would be so happy if they just asked me, "so what have you learnt today?". Sometimes, they being involved in the things which I want to achieve in my life, is so precious to me. They won't ever understand that. I don't know what they care about in my life. I don't know what do they really hold in priority where my life is concerned.  I don't come from a broken home, in fact its still very much intact. But how can one expect to achieve anything big in life, when you know the 2 people central to your life aren't part of it.

      I have the urge to talk about sex........I mean TALK, not HAVE. So its a different thing, don't expect some IRC convo copy and pasted here which actually spends 2 hrs talking about cybersex, which imo think its a total waste of time, and I think its for lamers who haven't experience what is sex in the context of true love. In fact, I haven't and also most people involved in cybersex are innocent puberscent teenagers, which I happen not to fit into the category.  Anyway, before I get more and more into cybersex let's explore sex in the most most "purest" form, and by purest I mean wear your fig leaf garment and stuff. What is sex about really? I don't know, no no seriously I don't. Why? Because I have not had sex yet, DUH! But its amazing as to how many opposite ends of the spectrum can sex be approached, from the cistern monk style of not talking about it at all, to the typical teenage pre-occupation with it, and i mean pre-occupation, perpetually.  Yea, and don't think that girls are the shy gender, before I launch into a sociological discussion on gender, which *gasp* I haven't, after all gender was the issue which tickled my critical thinking skills. Yah yah, I know a bulk of my readers are all teenagers like YOU, so you're those kind who'll most probably be those who "get to the point" and hate small talk like this. Well, after all this is foreplay, and yea I'll launch into a discussion.........  Now, yea ok let's start, I won't go into the very technical details and this post would not be something too esoteric about sex, because of course, where do you guys know about sex? Porn? I mean geessh, that is the worst place to learn about sex. If you seriously want to learn about sex, as in LEARN not to get stimulated. Read books about sex, so kids.....yes, today we shall learn about sex, and yah ok, first take out tissue paper wipe the saliva dripping from your mouth cos' we're not watching porn. And no, we're not getting into 101 various positions from the kamasutra to *insert signature move of porn star here*. We'e reading.....*insert name of a sexologist who happened to be a smiling and kinda fat middle aged guy*'s book.  Sex is serious business dude, its the single factory which drives the manufature of you and me, and of course porn. But what really is sex? Sex comes in many different forms, SM, oral, to name a few. But sex is after all, about intercourse. And what really is intercourse? In english, intercourse is communication, and lemme say this whoever came up with the word intercourse for sex, is indeed a genius and he has a very very lucky partner/s. So yes, kids, sex is.......say together with me......communication.  Ok, sex is more than carnal pleasure, the penetration, the fluids, and all those physical processes, yea which I think after so long watching porn, you should be more than familiar than that. But there's one thing you can't know just by watching those cheap plastic american flicks, it is the psycological aspects of sex, the joining of one heart one soul and of course 2 extremely sensitive parts of the body. What is sex, and most importantly, what is good sex? Good sex is communication.  It is sensing the nuances of each other. How is your partner feeling? It is pleasing each other, and is about selfless giving. In fact I see that sex should be celebrated and lauded as one of the most profound mediums of communication which God has given us, to be shared by someone who we spend the rest of our lives with. In fact I think that this way which God has created us to reach puberty at early teenage years, should be the time when we discover about sex, after all biology points to that.  It is society which dumbs us down with MTV, Mcdonalds and not forgetting porn. This makes us unable to handle the deep implications involved in sex. It is said that Singaporeans are one of the worst in bed, why? No, not because there's no porn in SG, but rather I believe the lack of exposure to what REALLY is sex, and HOW to have sex, sex really takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master (reversi? lol). Good sex, is like what I stated above, communication. I believe that we should all adopt a mature approach to sex.  And come on, let's talk about sex, in a mature fashion of course talk about it with your friends, your parents, in your church, talk about sex. Know more about it, and trust me, the more you know about it, the less "curious" you'll be, and porn would not be some place you get information about sex. Before having sex, hold conversations with your partner, don't be afraid to try SM, or any other more far-out practices if necessary as long as both parties are satisfied (not my kinda thing though), but don't forget the true meaning of sex, which is not carnal pleasure but communication. Don't just lapse into sleep after sex, linger in each other's presence, talk, communicate......  Anyway.....I'm done....now, didn't that felt good?

      ahhhhhh, the post below was kinda enraged, depressed and the product of a very sick mind, caused by a chain of equally sick events. And I can say that as long as the chain of sick events don't continue, my sick sick mind would soon not be so sick anymore. And I can say that things have been looking up, talked to Ben and that made my day. And it also has to do with the post which I wrote, i mean hey, is the first time i used the F word in my blog, out of 70 posts? and almost 30000 words later. But I'll see how things go on Monday to judge whether they'll be any recurrence of posts like that.  But, I guess you won't be seeing that in a while. Even though I consider the F word an art in itself, its an icing on the cake of english though, too much would give you diabetes and make you sick, but a smattering of it would definitely make the cake much nicer. I see it as something poetic, anyway, Stephen King uses it, even though that chao ah beng at the void deck uses it more than him, ahh that golden haired monkey probably is as diabetic as that ant.   Anyway, yea, I have had a productive saturday today. and hey hey hey, Ruby is kinda puzzled about my personality though, so I shall summarize myself. I play guitar and listen to heavy metal but does that make me a head-banging, coke-snorting hippie? uhhhh no. I like chinese pop, but does that mean I'll wait at the airport, a week before their flight to recieve my favourite artist? again, no. I play piano and like classical music, does that make me an old fart whose seats are glued on that esplanade chair? you guessed it right, no. I am politically aware, and support quite a few causes, but do you see me in some kinda politically-laced t-shirt and going for that demonstration? no. And I like quantum/nuclear physics, as well as philosophy in short anything kinda intellectual. But does that make me a geek? hell.....no.  Anyway yea, I guess time spent outside of church is very productive and my saturday has been one of the most productive I've had by far. I've spent almost my entire evening in the library reading INTRODUCTORY (emphasis on introductory) nuclear physics and am still stuck at page 11, the whole thing about de Broglie's locality of particles got me lost in there, and the Heisenburg's uncertainty principle. As both are connected, page 11 is as far as I can go. And its only the 2nd page of the 2nd chapter which is quantum mechanics, guaranteed to be very difficult, in fact quantum physics is by far the most complex branch in physics, ever wondered why your o-level textbook does not mention anything about quarks and gluons or wave-particle duality?, now you know.  But not to fret, Yilin's friend, Simon if I'm not wrong, seems to know quite a bit as I can see a few smatterings of GUTs as well as some quantum terminologies in his blog, so I'm gonna drop him a comment or an e-mail. This is one subject I cannot do without a teacher, and the part about quantum mechanics is very very heavy on the maths, so its one uh-oh topic, but I guess I gotta know some quantum stuff if I wanna get into nuclear physics. I've made a huge bunch of notes, 4 pages to be exact as the book is a reference book, and I'm gonna spend the next day digesting it. Hopefully with some help from a mentor/s.  Anyway, on the more artistic side. I'm almost done with the FFX piano intro, the whole To Zanarkland song, its a wonderful song, paints a wonderful picture. And I went to Yamaha today, played the digital piano and its like WHAT !!!!!!!!! I can stay all day there man, its very very inspirational and I'm dying to get one, its 1500 tho, ahhhhhhhh! The sound the feel all, its like whoa.......and its like when I improvise, I can really feel the emotion everything coming out.  As for guitar, I've started on Satriani's version of Beethoven's 5th, and I can say that besides the cello or violin, it sounds great on guitar, esp. with lots of distortion. The harmonic minor is cool, really blends in without being to obtrusive. Which I have the knack, or should I say any musician which ain't that good yet, have the knack for making the harmonic minor sounds obtrusive, but definitely not Beethoven. I'm kinda inspired by classical music in all aspects of my musical life, be it piano or guitar, esp. maybe Malmsteen for guitar, and I hope to learn ALL positions and shapes of diminished, phrygian and harmonic minor, as well as some runs. Seriously, me knowledge on scales is kinda shit. Need to work on that.  And also, I'll like to work on my alternate picking and triplets, and how to use them better in the context of a fixed scale. As well as learn some more "blues chords" dominant 11ths, and the like. cos' I can do note by note blues soloing but I can say then again, my knowledge of chords is pretty limited. Besides the usual G Am F#m stuff I need to really learn more chords to give my solos more diemension, esp. on clean and new chords and voicings really help in songwriting.......  Ah guess I've written too much, today is a wonderful, but also very confusing saturday (quantum mechanics have the knack for doing that), but all in all. As I sit here typing away, I can say that I will go to sleep fulfilled.........

      I don't know what the heck should I write, if you ask me, I'm like whoa, ok, if you wanna know how I feel now, its depressed. Ok? Depressed? Don't ask why. And cos' you don't need to ask why, I'm gonna say it now here. If you think you can get some juicy shit outta my personal life, the f off, I don't need some bastards to laugh, to be entertained by all the crap which I am going through.  I hate it when people laugh at my misofortunes. I hate people who feed on other people's sadness. I hate people who step all over you when you are the most down. I hate people who keep reminding me of something which I want to forget.  In fact I hate everything, you know what do I want to do now? I just wanna get amnesia, and forget every single shit that has happened. And if I can't, I don't know what can I do. I feel like shit, I really do. One part of me wants to reach out and tear the entrails out of people, another which craves for other people's love and affection and another which wants to crawl into my big black lonely hole.  Fuck everybody who gloat over my misofortune, fuck YOU if you're laughing. And if you see me looking like shit. NO I'm not thinking about what happened in the past. I'm way past those.....ohhh ohhh will she talk to me??? Ohhh ohhh she's frolicking with other guys, I'm so jealous shit. YOU THINK I CARE? NO FUCK NO! You are not any part of my life anymore. You know why I'm feeling like that? Well, I tell you why.  I regret liking you in the first place, i mean, yea yea its not your fault, really I don't blame you. And in fact this post is not directed at you. I know its me, I know its me, but its like what the heck can I do? Everything was so happy last time, when everything was so peaceful. You know what I feel? I exchanged joy which is lasting, and people whom I can depend on, for just a night with a prostitute. And guess who's the prostitute? its not you, its me.  Its like fuck, I've given many many many many things. I know its not your fault. My dignity, everything, I hate it, I don't hate you, I hate myself. I hate all that I've given up on. I hate all that I've exchanged all for. You know what? Even if you suddenly like me, have an about-turn, nothing would change. Cos' you know what? All i wanna do is to forget you.  Ohhh and please, its not those stupid romantic, ohhhhhh ohhh true love cannot be forgotten kinda shit. NO its not that, the fact is that I don't beieve in true love anymore. You know what? If true love is gonna be like what I went through, I'm not having any of that shit. I just want to forget the dignity which I lost, the hurts I've gotten. And please its not the love i can't forget, its the pain, and all the shit.  You know what? I heard that I can use a psycological technique called "locking" memories in order to forget. I wanna get amnesia.

      The song which I took inspiration from in my dream. This song has to be sang by a female. As it is kinda high-pitched, esp. in the oh...h parts in the chorus.. They'll be only acoustic guitars in the background and maybe a piano in the chorus. That's all. Very unplugged. Meant to be soft. Unlike my last chinese song which I wrote, I've got the tune figured out.    There'll be only Kings     First Verse   As the silence fills the empty hallway. A throne now empty who can fill its place? Not forgetting yesterday,  The king came here to stay. All I wanted to be, a loyal subject. But who can fill this place?   Pre-Chorus   A smattering of crimson flowers, Reminding me of the chill which leaks inside. The morning dew settles on the backyard. The butterflies they play.   Chorus:   Oh...h....who can say I'm not lonely? and Oh....h...who can hear me say? Not waiting in this lonely castle, The only sound of the leaves as they rustle. Just hoping that the day will come when, There'll be only kings.  (Guitar Fill)   Second Verse:   Sitting on my throne gazing on my subject. A place I hope I now could abdicate. Endless tears which flow at night, who can hear my cry? Amidst the satin soft and shiny, but tell me why's there pain?  (To Pre-chorus)   2nd Chorus:   (after 2nd verse and pre-chorus)  Oh....h...who can say I'm happy? Oh.....h...who can love me again? Oh....h....why this chilly rain? Chromating silence fills the stairway. So poignant as I go insane........  Just hoping and waiting that there'll come a day when There'll be only kings.....

      Yah, an update on my life. Just had 3 DTs and physics and chem is next. Can say all the DTs were wonderful. DTs are diagnostic tests btw, it sounds like some cute little test to see whether you qualify for the post for research scientist in SETI (those guys who search for green little aliens). But anyway, its not, all you get is what some test which almost every other 16 year old in the Singaporean mainstream education sit for. So if you thought I'll be off dissecting aliens.......uhhh no.  Yea, english was about trees. Just one word "trees" and its like what the heck ! I wrote a huge bunch and just rambled on and on and on, i think i hit more than 500 words man, and I finished it in just 25 minutes. I talked about conservation environmental and how science should be the future if we wanna go green. And conservation should not be a long term solution. English is looking good.   Combined humans i can say I did not study at all, just read through it. But SS was very very easy, expecting quite abit and geog was kinda hard, but just crapped my way out. I think should be able to pass but alot of people just left the part about sustainable development which is 15/25 marks blank, so I think geog is overall very hard for all. And maths today was really easy as well, did not study but quite confident, left almost all the locus question blank tho, which means maybe 4-5/60 marks gone but quite confident about the rest.....  Yea, and I had a wierd dream last night. Actually its those dreams where I woke up at 5:30 am then slept again cos' I gotta wake up at only 6:30. Then ok I slept I dreamt of really alot of shit. I dreamt that my phone when I opened it I've got alot of cakes to choose from, i dunnoe how the heck can those cakes fit into my phone, but trust me, it can, but anyway, I was dreaming so it won't make much sense.  But the best part was I dreamt about a song! It was a song like not written anywhere else, its like.......wonderful almost from God, inspiration. I was listening to Shin Yue tuan before I slept and the song I heard was in the style of more Lisa Loeb kinda pop, with acoustic guitars and all, so it has no relation whatsoever to the music I have heard. Ok, so i shall tell you how the dream went. We were talking about relationship problems though.  It was like a counselling session, there was this woman 20+ she was like hurt and all, I dunnoe how did she end up there, and of course we were eating cakes from my phone, ok.....now its getting wierd, but hang in there. So she got really emotional and started singing a song, and it was like I could remember the title very vividly. It is called "There'll be only kings".  The rationale is like, sometimes, people will be king over our hearts in love, they rule us and at the same time for some people, they can have a king in their hearts but they are kings themselves in other people's hearts. But as for some very unfortunate people, they cannot be kings, and for some, they don't have a king. The ideal situation is of course, you own that person's heart and that person do. The line would be "someday.....there'll be only kings". It actually signifies a world of perfect love.   I'll get started on it soon........as in finish writing the whole song.

      A new poem I wrote, abit brutal but spiritual, but yet again talks about love.    Death-The Path To Release     As I attended my funeral, asking what the hell I did. Garlands hanging around my neck, What the fuck, how did it all came to be? As the shame of my life turns to night. Forgotten kisses which passed the shoulder. Dying without regret, as what eternity is death? Thought I could never put my life past me. But here I am in this nailed coffin, smirking while all else mourn my passing.  Killed in an iron maiden. Humiliated on the gullontine. Shame which filled my life are now past, Gone with my head as it rolled on the stone cold floor. Seeking valhalla, seeking heaven. And they told me beware of the pharisees which have the leaven. "Hypocrites", "Hypocrites" as Jesus said. Please Dear God, I don't want to end up like them.  Up amongst the throne of judgement, my dear hevenly father sat. My child, you have suffered, but your work ain't done. Go back to Earth, you have not yet had your fun. And back to the world I went, just as God has sent. Seeing the furnace burn, charring the lips which I once kissed. Just as they thought I would mourn with them, How wrong they were, for I would never shed any tears for this sham.

      Let's talk about my friend, I don't wanna divulge his name out, so let's give him a name, say.....John. John was this pretty average guy and he was 16 years old. He is from a neighbourhood school somewhere in the east. John is quite a handsome guy and so, he has a girlfriend, let's call her Jane. Jane is from the choir, but Jane is an ah lian. Jane smokes alot, and she drinks alot, anything from tiger to VSOP. She was unlike John who was this guai kia, very good in his studies, never smokes and drinks anything from Liang Teh to diet coke. Naturally, John's friends thought the match was total crap, and would refer to them as John and that pai kia.  One day, John and Jane were walking along Tampines mall. When they saw 6-7 indian girls, dressed in all black, 666 tatooed on their arms, making a wierd noise. Upon careful listening, John realized that it was the chorus of the hit song of a Hindi trash metal band. Jane suddenly froze, "Wah lau eh, all those keleng kia, under block 854 i fight with them before, ooi dahling ah, faster zhao ah, my gang not here.". Naturally John and Jane, walked away, trying to look as inconspicious as possible.  Looking concerned John told Jane ,"But dear, didn't I told you to quit being part of the gangs a long time ago? You know those are bad company." Jane retorted ,"Ooi, dun kao peh kao bu can or not? These are my hia ti, I leave is cannot go back, is betray hia ti, u ask me leave is ask me to Kee see understand or not?". But the commotion attracted the Indian girl gang who happened to walk past.  "Hey you...Vanakam, dat dey we fight u at the block 865, we Indian the maths very good dey, number we remember good good. Ahh, we now not want to fight fight lah, but our hand all itchy itchy, still mus fight. You tell ur chinese gang come and fight, tonight same place." The girl paused for a while, then continued"......ehh I tonight meeting Muthu, cannot lah we all go and eat Briyani dey, cannot, tomorrow we go fight.". Then, they walked away, now singing the sitar solo of that hindi song.  With this, Jane called up the gang leader, "ooi, those see keleng kia want to fight ah, tomorrow night, ask our hia ti come.". "eh, John ah..."....before she could finish, she realized that he had walked away, and she dunnoe if he was heartbroken at her insistence to continue with such gang activities, or did he just simply  lose his balls when those Indians came.   Find out on the next episode of...........shit, haven't thought of a title....

      I guessed I talked a little too loud during physics today huh.....lol. But really, was really emotional and sitting beside Woon Han also, so naturally I'll be more open since the subject of my love life was breached. Yea, so I'll give you an update on my life which is kinda rare lol. Hmmm, I seem to have slacked more, maybe because its uhhh "revision"? But yea, I actually prefer studying now, its really amazing. Reading more intellectual books really helps, I consider it a privellage to learn about stuff in school, especially science.  Because I see that the world is so vast, and what I'm learning is just peanuts. So yea, I actually find that learning stuff keeps me in perspective and gives me insight on things around me. But I guess physics today was more......emotional? I hope that I'll do better for my chem tho, ganbatte, cos' I dunnoe my chinese results.  I've got a busy day ahead tomorrow and I'm still writing at almost 1 am now, cos' I slept, 6-10pm, bad for my sleep patterns yea I know. Mostly guitar stuff tomorrow, wanna sign up for the comp. on the 28th ! Can win a pacifica, the higher end ones, and I need to go to plaza Sing. to sign up, crap. Wanna get my guitar fixed, intonation and stuff like that. Hopefully can do a few mods, for free, i hope, cos' its still under warranty.  I hope to spend more time at the library during the weekend, reading about stuff. I'm really interested in the history of science especially during the enlightenment age, I have recently acquired an interest for the sociology of science and quantum physics. Have not really read about quantum physics yet, but the whole thing about a Grand Unified Theory (GUT), quarks and gluons really have sparked my interest.   Have I mentioned that I want to do physics in the U, nuclear physics is what I'm interested now, don't think I'll do quantum, but I'll see what goes afterI'm somewhat satisfied with my education in the social sciences that is. But don't worry, I won't be doc ock. Nuclear physics is really something which has revolutionized our view of the universe and society as a whole, I really hope to find certain ways in which nuclear energy can be harnessed in as safe a way as possible. Its my personal belief that nuclear energy is the energy source for the future, but I guess we need to be able to handle it well enough.  I endorse efforts to slow down on nuclear development, because I don't think we would be able to handle it. Also, cold fusion has struck my interest as well, and I'm gonna do some reading on that, I'm all too familiar with the 300+ and 100+ sections in the library, time to get into the physical sciences now, oh God, I guess I'm turning into a nerd.

      Here's my first chinese song which I wrote, since its been written by a reformed dead caucasian dog, (see ang moh kao in hokkien), cut it some slack lol, but honest comments are always welcome.  等不了的爱  First verse: 还想起爱上你的昨天 你的笑昨夜还在我心里边 但当我停止发酵 影子也不再我梦里不停的飘 才开始有点懂 爱你所带来的伤痛  Pre-Chorus 但只能随着命运的安排 灵魂别再昨天徘徊 也不想看到明天 还对你有所眷恋 所以决定放下这段恋爱 不要再怕被你受伤害  Chorus 治不了的伤口 离开一去就不再回头 我已明白直到永永远远 你不在我身边  爱的滋味虽浓 昨天的回忆开始有一点痛 但我明白直到永永远远 你不会在。。。 我心里面  2nd Verse 无禁等待明天爱的遥远 想忘齐昨天的恩怨 是否只不过是彩虹，我还不懂 也不知下半辈子谁会培我一起疯 (to pre-chorus after 2nd verse)  Bridge 别再继续等待 别再继续忍耐 别想继续信赖 这份等不了的爱

      Relatvism has not remained very popular in the intellectual community, but it has enjoyed considerable success as compared to say, universal constructionism. What really is relativism? The post-modernist answer to the enlightenment, draws a middle path between rationalist, functionalist among many others who seek to theorize the many different schools of thought at that time and their impact on society. While relativism is almost philosophical, as opposed to say functionalism or symbolic interationism, which is probably why it has seen little popularity with sociologists.   There are a plethora of objections to relativism, say, moral relativism for one. The belief that there is no right nor wrong, that right or wrong is relative, subject to a particular "discourse" as Foucault puts it, or a socio-cultural setting. While it sounds pretty idealistic and fantastic, and maybe a little "intellectual", what is its implications? What about the holocaust and the crusades? Is the holocaust simply a relative crime? A product of simply an act which cannot fit into the norms of society at that time?  If you say yes, after all, the morality of such acts can be debated on paper, but if moral relativism  is brought about into a political level, and put in the hands of Adolf Hitler, let me see if staunch supporters would still be singing the same tune if their families were massacered, no different from Pol Pot's. But while moral relativism poses such moral questions, it is not completely invalid. But for one, we have to redefine the definition of relativism. If relativism is the belief that all systems/schools of thought/cognitive processes are equal and are simply relative to a particular socio-cultural setting, what do I really believe relativism is?  In my opinion, not all moral and cognitive processes are equal, but for one, none possesses absolute truth nor is it absolutely null and void, yes, all are subject to a particular set of discourses, but that does not mean that none possess objectivity, after all, the subjective is required to elucidate the objective. The very extreme interpretation of relativism as seen above is really what I call Relativistic Fundamentalism. I guess we have forgotten what relativism was really all about.   Its like christians forgetting what Jesus has taught them and start bashing other religions with the bible, and if they have political power, they start bashing with the sword. We have to understand the purpose of relativism that one, there is no such thing as total positivism, no scientific theory or process is exempt from social construction. And that true (note I said true not total) objectivity comes when looking at a theory from different sets of discourses, a physicist doing a paper on sound waves would be wiser if he looks at the subject not only from a physics point of view, but maybe a musical one, start learning the 7 notes or scales, to inject a different point of view and to utilize a different discourse in his work, who knows what new theory can he come up with?  And lastly of course, relativism is all about tolerance and about rational discussion about other schools of thoughts which can be found to be morally wanting, instead of just simply adopting a nihilistic stance and reject moral essentialism totally. Moral essentialism to a large extent gives rise to bigotry, no doubt about that, but its absence would be the start of anarchy and lawlessness. Relativism, in my opinion is the best doctrine where our drive to learn is conerned, for a learner of the sociology of science, why stop there? Why not take a course in quantum physics or learn about classical physics and its theories? Relativism is all about eclectism, taking the best out of every belief system or cognitive process, and apply it to our lives, and this would be our never-ending drive to pursue knowledge, who knows what we can come up with in the process? Inter-galactic travel? Renewable energy? I don't know.......

       Disclaimer: not really a disclaimer lol, but just a few passing comments which to let you know what I'm saying now is not incuded in the article. This is pretty esoteric i might add, not really THAT esoteric as I'm not talking about the origins of the phrygian and its applications, or stuff along that line. But if you're not musically-inclined or do not play an instrument, then this won't be of interest to you, yep.   If you think that tabbing, especially tabbing solos are for people with perfect pitch like Mozart, well, tabbing is not that difficult, it is if you try to figure out every single note without a proper guideline. But, tabbing songs out yourself brings about great benefits, not only if you have a song which you can’t find any tabs for, but it also helps you grow as a musician. By tabbing solos out yourself, you get a better knowledge of scales and how solos are constructed, and it helps in developing pitch recognition…….who knows? Mozart might be transcribing what his sister played in their living room way before he was discovered at 5.  Well, here is a step-by-step guide to tabbing solos.    1. Break it down.   Breaking it down helps you to identify the different musical and beat patterns in the solo. It is really the simplest thing you can do, but also the most important.    2. Sing it out    Before the solos gets to your fingers, it has to get to your mouth. Sing out the solo and make sure it is in perfect pitch. Sing a B when the note playing is a B. Try singing the solo out, it works wonders.    3. Identify the key.    If you have a fairly musical ear, this should not be a problem for you. But if not, there are a few ways which you can do it. Firstly, identify the first note in the solo. If this cannot be done, then look at the intro of the song. What is the first note/chord being played?   Try using 5th chords on your guitar because 5ths possesses neither minor nor major characteristics. Try an E powerchord, followed by an F etc. until you find the chord with suits the pitch of the first note/chord. Never mind if the song has a d minor but you played a D5, you have just found out that the song is in the key of D, and that’s what we need to know……for now.    4. Identify the scale    Before you can identify the scale, you have to take the root note, and do a hit-and-run (i.e. transcribe by ear) at the first 3 to 4 different notes in the solo.  The second step to identify the scale is to make a logical guess. If you have a fairly good knowledge of scales, such a logical guess would not be too big a problem. If possible, identify it just be hearing the solo. But if not, here is how to take the first step to make a logical guess. Firstly, identify the genre, if it is hard rock, mixolydian or the minor pentatonic would be your usual suspects etc.   One tip: Pentatonic scales do not have any semitones unless chromatic passing tones are added to them. So, if there are no semitones in the first 4-5 notes you have figured out, you’re most probably in pentatonic territory, but don’t be too sure at this point.   Secondly, write down the first 3-4 different notes which you have figured out by ear. If you do not have a solid knowledge of scales, get to a website or a programme with a comprehensive list of scales which you can view from. See which scale contains the first 3-4 notes which you have found. If you have a few different scales which share the same 3-4 notes you have found, figure out by ear again 1 or 2 more different notes to narrow it down to only 1 possibility.  This can be the most easiest or the most difficult part depending on the solo and the scale/s used.    5. Write down the individual notes    I generally would not recommend the notes be written in tab, but rather in their names. Like B flat as Bb, instead of the 6th fret on the first string. Use the scale as a guide as to which notes you are “allowed” to use. Start with the root note and sing the pitch of the next note. Navigate till you find the next note. It should not pose too much of a problem if you have identified the scale and are able to sing the next note out.  Never mind, if the actual solo plays the B flat at the 3rd fret on the 3rd string and you started at the first string 6th fret, it is immaterial for now, what matters is that you get the different notes right.  This process could take you a bit of patience; the key is not to lose the pitch as you sing the note which you want to figure out next. Never mind the hammer-ons, pull-offs or bends for now.    6. Use a keyboard/piano    It is amazing how a keyboard or piano can make tabbing out your solos easier. Here are a few advantages.   a.	There are no repeat notes, all notes are distinct.   The fact that a keyboard has no repeat notes keep you in focus and won’t make the whole musical landscape seem so vast and complex, you only have to worry about 7 notes (depending on the scale) right now, ignoring the octaves, for now.   b.	All accidentals are laid out nicely    Scales are much easier to see and learn, and the lesser possibility of you hitting a note outside of the scale you found out. Hitting a wrong note could very well disorientate your musical senses for a while.   Try using the piano, it works wonders. Figuring out a portion of that Dream Theater solo is no different from figuring out twinkle twinkle little star by ear if done on a piano.    7. Identify octaves    When you have figured out all the individual notes, never mind that it sounds like three blind mice now, its time to figure out which octaves the notes belong to. Remember I said not to worry if the note you figured out is not of the correct octave? Now its time to take that into consideration, you can put aside the piano for a while, every string on the guitar has different timbral qualities when being hit at different frets, so the guitar is now much more suited for this job.  Play all the root notes of the scale in your guitar at all different positions, just the root note. Then, play the first 5-6 notes starting from each different root notes and tweak your ears to find out which octave the root note belongs to.  A process of “substitution” can take place here. Because say, an E can be played on the 12th fret first string but the same E on the same octave can be done on the 17th fret on the 2nd string. What’s most important here, after figuring out which octave it belongs, is simply to find the position which is most comfortable to you.  Remember that as you do this, write down the “raw tab” as I call it, of the different notes in tab, without adding the hammer-ons , pull-offs, the slides etc.    8. Identify techniques    Now it is time to add the harmonics, the slides etc. into the song. Anyone who has some experience on guitar would be able to tell the difference between a slide and hammer-on and know when there is a bend or vibrato. This process is fairly simple. Just add the techniques into the “raw tab” which you just wrote. Say you wrote a C then it goes up to an Eb, and there is a bend to get from the C to Eb in the solo, just simply notate a 3 fret bend on the tab.  When the techniques are all added into the “raw tab”, you can re-write it and voila! You have just successfully tabbed your first solo.   I hope that this guide would be a great help to you. Even though it takes a great deal of patience even with this guide in hand, but I hope that it won’t make tabbing such an impossible task. If you’re thinking “what for?” well, tabbing, like I said, helps develop your musical ear and gives you a greater understanding of scales and how solos are constructed.  Cheers…..and happy tabbing……

      Another poem I wrote, in a mood, again there are 2 themes. This goes to show that I did not plan anything, so I pretty much digressed. This ain't that good as the previous one I wrote, a few posts down, and the first theme is kinda blatant.    Untitled     As yesterday's visions haunt my sleep And past images invade every waking moment. I could only hope that time would be the source of all erosion. For a lost love I no longer pine. Amongst fleeting glances as we dine. For what hope is a love not blessed by all things divine?  As a plank about the ocean I slowly drift, A message in the bottle, hoping for someone to pick. Hoping for the monsoon to bring me to an island. A faraway land, which only the winds would bring me there. Amongst the vast sea, lonely and free. But this island I could not see.  For in there would I find comfort and solace. Not looking back to the ship which I once left.

      Yea, its wonderful seeing how big and small life can be. Sometimes love will hit you in the most improbable places. I guess I've start pining for someone who probably I have not met, and don't even know her name, I don't even know her. But yea, love can sometimes be very distant, and when someone comes along with some telescope, yea, maybe you do get carried away.   But really, sometimes to find true love, we gotta wait. We gotta realize that love is, kinda omniscient sometimes. It knows when you need it and really, you gotta be open when it hits. So if you're 50, disgruntled, single and very cynical, thinking that love is shit. Well....your fault. Really, I'm not one to buy the get hitched at 20+ kinda shit. And really, I believe that love happens at any age. But you gotta know who's the telescope and who's the star who's the one for you.  I believe in "the one" and yea, I believe she would appear one day, maybe I've yet to meet her, or she may be freezing her ass of in Siberia, or maybe heck, she may be someone right in front of me all this while. Sometimes, its the mystery of love which astounds us. And really, I gotta get that bit of mystery back into my life. I guess you won't ever know how liberating it is to forget a love which has caused you that much pain.  Its time when I need to put that smile back on my face. And no, I'm not giving up on chinese pop lol. Its really something I admire for its songwriting and really, we all need to believe in the power of love sometimes. Its my belief, which actually meant to explain and justify new systems or schools of thought, meant to be used in some political/sociological discussion, with hints of darwinism.   "There is no such things as good or bad circumstances, it is only how we react to it which makes it good or bad."  I realized its very much universal. Yea, whatever happens is never good or bad, it is bad because I react to it negatively. But a love lost is a life gained. I realized that I have the choice to make this circumstance and this situation positive, and to live life even more. Love has enriched my love no doubt, and it will continue to enrich my life, but yea the source of love differs. And now, my source of love is someone who I may have not met, have not talked to, have not known the name of. Or maybe its someone I have known all this while, or maybe not.   This is the mystery of love.........which sometimes thats what makes life beautiful.......

      A new poem I wrote. This poem is about love, anyway, all poems are about love unless stated otherwise. Wrote it on the computer. Impromptu with 2 themes basically.    Untitled     As dawn breaks after the lonely night. Nature’s doing, or is it? The feeling inside I did not fight,  As I remembered the times when the sun shone so very bright. As the sun set, and the darkness grew,  I felt like a fool, because I thought I knew, But now as the darkness clears my head. I realized the sun can never shine all day.  As I remembered the bygone sunshine,  And monochrome images sped through my head. I realized that dawn has broken, Illuminating meadows looking so sullen. As the weeds grow among the flowers,  Dereliction making the land go sour. For under nature’s whim, all living beings cower, But the weeds stands strong, not afraid of being devoured.  Hands bleeding as the farmer toils While the sharp weeds, he removes from the soil. Cherishing a hidden hope, of the flowers which yesterday bloomed. But who knows the flowers which belonged to yesterday, Would today turn to weeds and meet its doom.

      Whoa, I've just learnt the intro part to SRV's version of little wing. The patterns kinda repeat, and its based on the A pentatonic, but for one, this is definitely not the usual pentatonic stuff. I've recently been in the guitar playing mood. Anyway, went to the library today, as this being a school holiday, it was damn crowded, I saw Sai lam there too. Well, decided to go there and read, especially maths. One thing is that I can't understand most physics texts as most of them are all maths stuff. So, well, i've decided to take up maths for the sake of physics though.  Those guys at physicsforum said that a good place to start would be linear algebra and differential equations. And I've borrowed books which actually introduced these topics, so far so good i can say, even though linear algebra has alot of matrices, and I suck at matrices lol. As well as vectors. Differential equations are basically just differential equations, and DE is a tad more difficult that linear algebra, I haven't gotten into DE yet, but I can somewhat see that by skimming through the introduction.  Also got a book about beginning quantum physics, for people who are new to it, without the maths parts, introduces theories such as strings, super-symmetry and the like. And there's many questions in my head though,and many things to clarify. I've also gotten a book on introductory relativity. there's a little maths in there, but it doesn't look to advanced. I think its good if I know a little bit about relativity, and so far, I haven't really understood anything about relativity yet. Imo, relativity is by far the most confusing aspect of physics aside from quantum theory. They're actually not difficult, but just confusing.  Quantum theory and relativity are at odds with each other. and so far, I don't think I would really need to know about relativity as those are in the realms of cosmologists and astrophysicists, focuses on the large scale stuff. Quantum physics is what I'm interested in, and there's hardly any relativity involved (i think...). Hmmm, but the maths is what I'll focus on now. Right now, stuff like sociology and philosophy has become more leisure reading lol. And I think its good, sometimes when I'm tired with the physics or maths sections in the library, I'll go read about philosophy and stuff, helps relax my mind.  My saturday evenings are now spend almost entirely in the library, and when it closes at 9, I'll go somewhere to read. Its good, like i said, I feel that I'm in a place which belongs to me on a weekend, and not a church. Well, I've got nothing against christianity though, and still consider myself a christian. But hmmmmm, heard from Amanda that Aussie churches are not bad, kinda suit me, open to discussion and stuff. But I've got one thing against huge churches though, it feels abit too corporatized already, like I'm attending a board meeting every week. Feels abit, plastic, abit.......Britney Spears, y'noe?  Anyway, that aside, I find that time spent in the library has so far been really fruitful. And I can say that now, my life is looking up..........whoo. But I worry though, that if I do so much of such stuff, how will my O levels look like?? I really dunnoe, but I feel the need to really perform in the O'levels. To show my parents that I know what I'm doing and let me plot my own path in my education, and I think that's really important to me, to learn the things which I want to learn.

       God may be a woman, God may be man, or he may even be the photon which lights up a lamp. Or maybe a quark, or even a hippie, just remember that he can be anything you want him to be.   Apparently the church painting God as a man is very flawed, and they forget the whole I am who I am thing. Besides, God is so powerful, so doing this whole mystique thing should be too big a problem for him. There is no true form for God, he's everything.......

       This is a story that talks about faith:  "Let me explain the problem science has with Jesus Christ."  The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.  You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"  "Yes sir," the student says.  "So you believe in God?"  "Absolutely."  "Is God good?"  "Sure! God's good."  "Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?"  "Yes."  "Are you good or evil?"  "The Bible says I'm evil."  The professor grins knowingly.  "Aha! The Bible!" He considers for a moment.  'Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help them? Would you try?"  "Yes sir, I would."  "So you're good...!"  "I wouldn't say that."  "But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't."  The student does not answer, so the professor continues. "He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?"  The student remains silent.  "No, you can't, can you?" the professor says. He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.  "Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?"  "Er... Yes," the student says.  "Is Satan good?"  The student doesn't hesitate on this one. "No."  Then where does Satan come from?"  The student falters. "From... God..."  That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?"  "Yes, sir."  "Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything, correct?"  "Yes."  "So who created evil?"  Again, the student has no answer.  "Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness. All these terrible things, do they exist in this world?"  The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."  "So who created them?"  The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his question,  "Who created them? "  There is still no answer. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom. The class is mesmerized.  "Tell me," he continues. "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son? The student's voice betrays him and cracks.  "Yes, professor. I do."  The old man stops pacing. "Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Jesus?"  "No sir. I've never seen Him."  "Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"  "No, sir. I have not."  "Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus?  Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or God for that matter.  "No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."  "Yet you still believe in him?"  "Yes."  "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?  "Nothing," the student replies. "I only have my faith."  "Yes, faith," the professor repeats. "And that is the problem science has with God. There is no evidence, only faith."  The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of his own.  "Professor, is there such thing as heat?"  "Yes," the professor replies. "There's heat."  "And is there such a thing as cold?"  "Yes, son, there's cold too."  "No sir, there isn't."  The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain.  "You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than -458 degrees. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."  Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer.  "What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?"  "Yes," the professor replies without hesitation. "What is night if it isn't darkness?"  "You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light... but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word.  In reality, Darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?"  The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester.  "So what point are you making, young man?"  "Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed."  The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. "Flawed? Can you explain how?"  "You are working on the premise of duality," the student explains.  "You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it. Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?"  "If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do."   "Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"  The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going. A very good semester indeed.  "Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?"  The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided.  "To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean?" The student looks around the room.  "Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?"  The class breaks out into laughter.  "Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain?  No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir. So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?"  Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable. Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers.  "I guess you'll have to take them on faith."    If by reading this, and think this would be adequate in answering the questions posed by science to religion, then it would be quite wrong. Some questions which theology can't answer are, the problem of evil, the divinity of christ as well as other sources which contradicts the canonized bible,such as Jesus' alleged marraige to Mary Magdalene.  And on the other hand, there are some things which theology is apparently very comfortable with such as design, the whole "I can't see God so he don't exist" thing. Actually the whole I can't see God is very passe, esp. with the advent of quantum physics as well as some philosophical schools of thought such as phenomenology or universal constructionism. Anyway.....here's why it is flawed, i mean the thing above.  Ok, so the first thing the professor challeneged the student is on the problem of evil, really really sticky stuff. So, the authour painted the student as the "turn the other cheek" kinda student at first. Ok, so whatever, student gets trashed, and the things which get challenged is basically the problem of evil, which theology cannot find any adequate answer to.  So, ok, the professor very satisfied as the enemy did not launch any counter-attack, he touched on the whole "I can't see God so he don't exist" thing. So, after that, the student countered back as to why, y'noe that this whole thing is passe. And he countered the whole evil argument with the whole absence of light thing.  And note that he countered the evil argument first, as the authour writes it. And it providesa less than satisfactory answer to it, it hints at free will, which i believe that is a popular but kinda crap argument if you look at it. Why can't God design free-will without letting evil in? He can do anything, even though we can't understand how such 2 supposedly contradictory entities can co-exist, after all, human thought is finite.  Ok, so counter-argument done, anyway, the evil argument is still left very much inconclusive. And the whole I can't see God thing is countered brilliantly by the student, which imo, is not too difficult. Just give something about how seeing a particle would alter its momenta and position, and in fact everything about it, and that wave packets would be more adequate, giving rise to uncertainty. Ok, in short, countering the whole I can't see God is a piece of cake.  So, the authour puts this piece of cake counter-argument as the conclusion, hoping to mask the inability to counter the evil argument, and note the big words when countering it, the whole thing about empirical evidence and something about protocol, and the whole thing about electricity and magnetism.  And tada, christianity wins the day. So, here's is an example of rhetoric courtesy of the christian church, dissected by me. Thank you very much.  And also, i'll digress abit. Well, I know that electricity exists because if I stick my fingers into the mains socket, I'll get my ass fried, so well, I know for sure electricity exists. And well, Faraday did a few experiements to confirm the nature of electricity and magnetism, so i know it exists. Einstein did the whole photo-electric thing, so I know that everything is both a particle and a wave yada yada. But God did an experiment called creating this whole universe, so we know that he/she/it/ exists.   but for one thing, the church knows nuts about HOW the earth was created, so don't act as if you guys know alot, among many others. And Plato, concluded that he was the smartest guy around because he was the only one who could admit that he didn't really know anything. And judging from history, the church must have been very dumb....

      A poem which I wrote for my school's poetry contest, didn't have much feeling at that time, more of a write for the sake of writing. But anyway, here it is. Loosely based on a poem i wrote many posts back with the same name.    The Piece     As the wind passed the curtain, Fraying crisp fabric, chilling warm air. Bygone notes, abandoned rhythms. Forgetting the piece you taught me how to play. Skirting past harmonic minor,  Barely reaching the one-half step. Remembering when fingers danced, On ivories and on a string,  Never mind forgotten dinners,  And tears which flew past in here. Sacrificing much for this piece, Not unlike Jason searching for the Golden Fleece. But time to leave this musty room, For etched between these keys, nothing, but endless gloom.

      Oh yea update on my life, my results are wonderful I can say. Never mind the English which I got a borderline pass and the geog and chem which I failed. English I just simply wrote out of point, can be corrected, if only they gave the right questions lol. Geog just have to memorize the mainpoints and I hopefully can be sitting on an A1. Chem is like......hmmm, failing is expected. I don't find chemistry difficult, I am just not bothered to study. My motto in studying is this, nothing is too difficult for my brain to absorb. And I believe everyone should have that mottoo, nothing is too difficult.  I'm not really interested in chem, because I do not see how chem will have any impact in my life, I don't see chem making a diff. in my life. Cos' after secondary school, chem is over for me. But as for physics, I WANT to study, because yea, I like physics, and maths, I'm being dragged down, because physics I need to be good in maths, especially for quantum mechanics. So, yea, I'm interested in maths because I see its relevance. English, well, sociology, philosophy and the like, i like discussing them, so english, yea relevant. Social studies, in line with political science, yea interested in that also, geog in line with sociology   I actually decided to give guitar lessons again, the first few q few months back was a flop, probably because I did not know much theory, and knew shit about scales, chords and the like. Now, yea, I've gotten back in business and my first student, technically not the first, but the first one to get taught by the new improved me. I actually hesitated about wanting to give lessons, because of O levels yada yada. But if its all those, "do it after the O levels" stuff, I wouldn't be interested in quantum physics, and in fact would not have done alot of things. Geog, in line with sociology, so I can say that fortunately stuff i do, I'm interested in them.  Don't talk to me about bio, or physical geog, or the earth sciences, those stuff are boring imo. Anyway, yah my tests marks besides those sucky ones are.  Emaths: 45/60 (75%) Amaths: 52/60 (85%) Physics: 39/45 (86%) Social Studies: 25/25 (100%)  So anyway, I taught guitar, and it was pretty good. I actually thought he wasn't that bright, but really, he's one of those guys, kinda like James Chadwick, quiet, and LOOKS unpromising, then kaboom, before you know it, he discovered the neutron. He is actually quite smart, and I taught him actually the basics, like notes and accidentals. Then we went on to powerchords then string bending, then Enter Sandman. He is pretty good at riffs though, but riffs aren't my forte, so i don't think I will have much to teach him about rhythym guitar.   I myself am no expert on rhythym either, I don't even know how to do syncopation and stuff, and all those rhythyms. more on lead and I intend to touch on that with him next week. A minor pentatonic, the root shape first and basic improvisation. He has good rhythymic sense, but I don't know about his melodic ear, so I'll see it next week. Anyway, great lesson though, and one more student is incoming, actually its good, because students I've been getting fits into my area which I'm better at which is lead guitar, and I've had a few breakthroughs in my theory knowledge so far, and I hope to cover the mixolydian, phrygian and locrian myself.  I've already learnt the 5 pentatonic shapes, can already play the A minor pentatonic all over the fretboard, and the G minor pentatonic as well. Whoo......things are indeed looking up........

      I just went to the library again, and made one discovery, the air-con there is too cold, and there's one thing which drives me, its not really discipline but inspiration. I didn't really do much at the library yesterday, just made a few notes regarding the wave-particle duality, the whole de Broglie's relationship stuff, read a few books regarding religion and philosophy. Actually, looking back, I should have spent my whole evening there, but really, the mood wasn't there, last week was better though.  But I feel good, almost like the library has become my new "church", lol. I used to go to church on weekends but now its off to the library. No more church for me, I've quitted, tada, in case you did not know. I feel liberated really, liberated in my mind. People can control any part of me, my body, but there's one thing, I would NEVER allow anybody to control my mind, nobody tells me what to think, and tell me this principle is correct that principle is wrong, I figure out myself, and I don't need your help thank you very much.  Anyway, back to that topic, about controlling my mind, exactly, well, I make my own informed decisions about my beliefs, I do not only seek scientific perspectives but also religious ones as well. I just took a test though, and they said my beliefs are more suited for neo-paganism. Y'noe what? I hate being part of something big, to be part of some spiritual xerox machine, or some spiritual factory, where spiritually "strong" people are manufactured. Its like I'm a soldier ushered into some rank and file, being told what to think what to do.  God encouraged individuality, he encourages personal style of worship, and revelation, stuff like that. God reveals himself not only in religion, but also in science, in art, in nature. So, the church telling me that only THEY have the true revelation of God is repulsive. A christian bookshop should not only sell christian stuff but also beethoven, mozart, U2, Rush. Van Gogh stuff like that. Such stuff is from God, and they worship God, even if the artist did not mean it to be that way, but the beauty is testement of God.  So anyway, enough of my ranting about the pitfalls of organized religion. I just realized that religion provides this view of reality which is incomplete, and it requires science, art etc. to fill in the gaps which also they themselves are incomplete and need religion to fill in their gaps, so its more like an inter-dependent relationship.  Its time for the church to see that there are no absolute truths nor lies.
