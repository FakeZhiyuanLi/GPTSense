      Earlier on this pointless Wednesday, I look over the soon to be finished month as if it was my last. My thoughts hault as I recall the canceling of Lollapalooza. My hate for Perry Farrell could have not, and can not be stronger. For he has both helped brake up Jane's Addiction, and has helped cancel his original, beloved festival, Lollapalooza.  My anger stops, and I decide to finally download  Kazaa Media Desktop , again, for the ninth time. So, I manage to sucessfully download the program in ten minutes, a new personal record has been captured by myself. I am pleased. So, I gather the portion of my latest and most recent CD lists. For my love for CD's and constant plans to buy certain albums forces me to write them down, or I will forget them. I download sections of certain albums, or any band name I see on the list. Finally, my eyes catch The String Cheese Incident. Though I am quite familar with String Cheese, I do not own all of their albums, and do not know all of their songs. So, I proceed to download. The jam happy, band that is String Cheese always attracts me, being that my favorite bands are usually bands that perform positive, jam, slightly technical, songs. And live for live concerts and events.   Following the downloading of several songs, one including a cover of "Ripple" by The Grateful Dead, I remember their spot on the Lollapalooza band list. I think, and I am ultimatly depressed.   Over the day, my anger and sadness over power my good side. I begin to release madness upon my cat, my family, and a waiter at Denny's. I even remember my last trip to Disc Replay, and how each String Cheese album was over twenty dollars, and used. I almost gave a lick(I say lick meaning punch, not lashing of the tongue, ass) to the cashier in the face. So, throughout this July, I only ask people to remember The String Cheese Incident, and either listen to them or eat a stick of string cheese or any kind of cheese.   My depression is over exaggerated, but none the less...

      Following a hard day's work of forum surfing, internet porn, feline harassment, review writing, and CD listening. I come to the conclusion that I shall wet my whistle. "I deserve this" my mind tells me. So following a trip to the lavatory to release waste, I make my way to the garage. Seconds before, I remember my last runnin with Mr. Dan Rather, him telling the viewers that the ozone has grown weak. So, I think to myself...I have yet to see the light of day for several weeks. Destruction could have reigned over the world. I worry to the thought that the sky may be dripping acid rain, and that it will be seeping through the garage roof. So, I decide to make my trip fast and gather enough goods to last me for two months. I duck my head, cover myself in five rain coats, and make a strong effort to move fast. I luckily make it out of the garage with seven cans of carbonated soda, three cans of Campell's long lasting noodle soup, and my extra copy of Bob Marley's  Legend .   Over several hours of playing  Red Dead Revolver , I check the state of my surroundings, and notice that the raining has come to a hault. The surroundings around me are worse then I imagined. I take a quick glance to the left. I see a teenaged, Greek looking boy, using some kind of machine to chop the grass on his lawn. He wairs no shirt, I am disgusted. I retreat to the lavatory were I would orally release three pints of already eaten food. My spirits were at a low.  Soon after four hours of revolving around my coffee table, I come to the conlusion I will die without entertainment, or something to keep me busy. So, I take a quick look to the right, and see in the mist of all the darkness,  Legend , the Bob Marley and The Wailers compilation.   I insert the compilation into the compact disc player. I leisurly turn to the second track. "No Woman No Cry" begins playing. The beauty of the song intrigues me, and I fall into a spectacular trance, and slowly drift away into slumber.  I wake up in a happy world where the Sun shines, disfigured Greek boys keep their shirts on, Rather tells positive stories, there is no acid rain, and Metal music is dead. The dream continues with adventures through mountains of the Moon, through Cumberland mines, and through marijuana fields of terrific sents.  I continue to sleep for one thousand years, and finally wake up in a world looking for change. I finally decide to attempt to make a difference, and change the world.   Farewell children. Learn from the story.

      As I stare into the depths of space from my worry stricken nook. My thoughts grow more angry by the second. I cannot not comprehend my feelings, and disbelieves, for the settlement known as Orland Park, Illinois. Behold the problems that await you and I in the near future.  As soon as two to three years, the brived, and ignorant city hall of Orland Park, will  finally come to the conclusion that the town would be more nessled and home like with the add on of a mosque. Now, not only has this estonishing goverment been payed off (Seize to believe me? Attend a town meeting), but they basically refuged to discuss questions about the matter with a logical excuse. Your parentals will have to give up money, so the streets can grow in width, for this mosque. Not only does the religion this mosque will hold despise the white race, but they also barely have a population in this town. Unless you come to the conclusion that the town may need you, I recomend you become great friends with the race that is killing your fellow man across the sea.  For I am not rascist, I just do not believe our village should be overran with immagrants, and the number one enemy of our land.  Keep in the mind, that the race already has benefits that people such as myself and others do not, and that the draft may come back in order. USA = Fare you well, Canada = Welcome me with open arms.

      Here, during my weakest hour, I grow fearful with the idea that the feline beside me will grow hostile against me. For the reason that I am pulling his moderate lengthed, black furred tail. I grow weary with each several minute.   The time as of now is a quarter to four AM. Viewing my brother constantly watch his rerun apon rerun of  Seinfeld , and notice him blindly stare into the seperate computer reading up on  Comunist Manifesto , and literature based upon national socialism is painful. Though, his opinions grow stronger, more sensible, and more against the topic, it still concerns me when those various subjects arise in our day by day conversations.  The night grows dim, so I debate with my wondering mind if I should remain in my constant state. Which now and always consists of roaming through various forums and web sites. Or shall I retire to the couch nearly three steps away, that my trust worthy St. Bernard lies upon.   I believe I shall regain my strenght. Tommorow shall be a long, pain stricken day.  Farewell...
