      So I've been inspired to blog, myself. One of my favorites just added a "comments" feature, which is just irresistable. You can talk to your Blogger entry by entry, like sticking Post-it notes in someone's book, and see who else is reading it by looking at their comments.  One guy put his blog in his comment; now I can go read  his  if I want. So I get it, now.  I think I knew you could link blogs to eachother, but I hadn't really given it much thought.    Anyway, I write to myself in a Word program or an actual notebook, and hadn't blogged online because I figured, who'd read it, and Jeez, my own journal can bore even me.  But I guess you never know, and I do have some interesting plans these days.  I'm also re-realizing that there is indeed a shy bone (or two) in my body somewhere, and though I like leaving the sacred alone, I'm interested to see if I want to change that, or how. But the kicker was seeing that other guy's blog in the comment box and thinking, man, I want something cool to link when I leave a comment.  And now I see there are a couple other people.  I'll list all three blogs I've referred to at the end of this entry.  I can't make the link function work...? I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point.  So I was late in discovering the internet, too, and went though a time when I could hardly get enough of it.  That tapered off, but I'm definitely hooked for good on email, looking stuff up, and now blogging. CRC, he of the "comments" feature, says blogging helps him.  It's always been a help to me to write at myself. It's an alternative way to think and process stuff, and the act of it has you accessing a different layer of your conciousness.  And I've always thought of myself as a writer, though (ultimately due to those shy bones, I guess) I have never published anything other than music reviews.  So this is a handy way to put those things together and get myself used to being outward with my writing.  Some of the interesting plans include finally submitting some short stories to be published.  I was really looking forward to doing this today, so...cool.  See you, soon.  P.S. Just do old school cut and paste with these - I can't seem to make the link feature work.  I'll look up how to write the tag later:  http://www.octophat.blogspot.com http://www.plastercity.com/blogs/ears.htm Http://www.dougkenline.blogspot.com

      The inaugural post... o.k., I'll kick it off with this little excerpt from  Le Petit Prince , by Antoine de St. Exupery:   "People have stars, but they aren't the same. ... for you, it'll be as if all the stars are laughing.  You'll have stars that can laugh!...And when you're consoled (everyone is eventually consoled), you'll be glad you've known me."   I'm always in love with stories, and that one's one of my favorites of all time.  I'm moved by the nature of this gift from The Little Prince to his friend, the pilot (I still choke up when I read that last chapter). They'll miss eachother when the charming little kid returns to his home in the sky. Since the pilot loves the prince's laughter, the little boy tells his friend to hear that laughter whenever he looks at the stars.  So I call the journal that others can read after stuff I like it known that I love: stories, sublime gifts, clever charcters and human connection.  I steep my life in that kind of stuff, and I love culling meaning for myself from stories. So, nice to meetcha, and I hope I hear from you, sometime.

      Good morning.  God, the Spain thing! God.  The world is  broken , right now.  I wish Spain were the only thing making me feel painfully sad and angry.  I have the political/world issues kill switch in me somewhere.  I think it actually works more like a dimmer, and when I need to breathe, it's just too real, too deeply scary, I use it. I turn it all waaay down, no news on the TV for awhile, no papers, this horrifying subject matter in such quotidian, blank language.  I don't sever myself, I don't pull the plug. But I allow myself refuge from the now constant abrasiveness of these times.  I feel grateful that the people I care about and I are all in one piece.  I indulge wishing hard that I was in love with someone, have a best pal to hang out in refuge with.  Who knows, maybe that's why I'm so scathable. I think when you're two, you each have the other as a buffer for this crazy life.  I dig my own company, I can be funny for myself and provide some of my own balm and sense of certainty and faith, but big, friendly men are the best back rubbers, and what if you need your back rubbed? My imagination's pretty good, but Jeez.  Sometime soon, I hope!   And on that hopeful note, I'll sign off.

      Otay, back to operative (just painfully slow), Thank God.  I wonder if it was something I did or not?  Computers baffle me.  I'm so grateful Blogger is so completely easy and nitwit friendly.  I love doing this.  I know I haven't come up with anything really fun or interesting since Squid Fuckery, but I'll try to correct that when I come home from work, tonight.

      I screwed up.  Spyware Nuker seem like some nice folks, and my computer is painfully slow (I'm stuck back in the World Wide Wait).  I did their free scan to see how infected my laptop is (I knew it must be), but in the process, some of  the spackle keeping it together must've come off.  I can't visit any sites requiring Java, even though the 'enabled' thingy is selected under Active Scripting.  Which includes hotmail, which is what I use. Which SUCKS. I need to check my email!  So, off to someone's house or a cafe I go, just to check my fucking email.  *Sigh*

      Howdy.  I ended up jogging most of the way to work yesterday, because I was running late, but I ended up feeling so good later on that I think I'm just gonna go with that as the current M.O., late or not.   I need to get my Walkman back from my friend's house.  Listening to whatever music I'm currently in love with actually seems to make me go faster and farther, like a continual psychic spur.  Wait a minute, usage - what's the difference between continual and continuous?  It slips my tired brain at the moment.

      It's all good, I'm back to legit on Technorati.  I spent like an hour and a half perusing all the weird and fabulous links at  urlLink leftblank  when I got home, last night.  It was a great reminder of what made the web so addictive when I first caught on to it.  Some web pages are really like interactive pieces of art, like check out and surf through  urlLink nobody here .  I'm not sure I could say I "like" it, stylistically or whatever, but it's cool just to see what people's brains come up with.

      I was searching my blog at Technorati to see if anyone besides  urlLink CRC  had linked me, and I ended up with a column full of weird shit saying stuff like this:  Warning: fsockopen(): unable to connect to ilb1:8080 in /home/technorati/php/clusterdbapi.php on line 6  Warning: fwrite(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in /home/technorati/php/clusterdbapi.php on line 50  I emailed them to ask what it means.  I'm seeing these days just how hopelessly not computer literate I am.  I don't get anything besides pointing, clicking and typing. :P  I'm sleepy.  I'll find something interesting to talk about when I wake up.

      I'm looking forward to seeing  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , the latest trip by Charlie Kaufman (Spike Lee: Joint, Charlie K.: Trip).  I have real fondness for his stuff, but also a newish favoritism. The catalytic moment for a great new life overhaul for me happened watching  urlLink Adaptation .  No, really. So, anyway, (oh, quit laughing), this new one features  urlLink Jim Carrey  as a badly wounded boyfriend who takes advantage of a new memory-erasing technology.  Scientists are able to get very specific about what gets erased, leaving the rest of your life intact. He opts to get his girlfriend literally out of his head.   It comes out on the nineteenth, and I'll review it, here.  I usually really like Jim Carrey - I never saw the Pet Detective flicks but Mask is a favorite movie of mine and I got a kick out of The Truman Show (how's that for original) and Bruce Almighty - but they say he's outdone himself with E. Sunshine.

      Dave Barry, the funniest columnist in the history of newspaperdom, began his column today (yesterday, actually; I have the work schedule of a bartender) about the national debt by saying firstly that the column would be addressing  the issue of "Celebrities Having Sex With Squid!".  Thus having your attention, he told the truth about the whole nation debt thing, saying something like, "Hey, no, wait - come back!  I've put it in a handy Q and A format..."  So this is like the third time in as many months that I've heard a squid-fucking reference, I'm happy to report.  This bit of language has a great little wet-smack emphatic satisfaction, a memorable funny certainty, hot color.  I like it so well I'd like to hear it get certifiably popular.  You could phrase sex with squid around incredulousness ("for God's sake, I'd sooner fuck a squid!"), fictious bravado ("I told my boss he could go screw squid"), pal-cuffing ("no, squidfuck, you hold the book  this  way"), or simply use it as an invective or exclamation (Holy copulating squid, Batman, you squidfucker, you!")  Get creative.    In the words of the great David "Last Days" Schmader, Nothing Happened Today.  So I'll see ya tomorrow.

      When I'm having a hard time focusing on writing projects, I let myself read instead.  But I slip down the slope into Penless Cove, and the longer I wallow around, the more muscles it takes to yank myself outta there.  It's just as hard to break habits of passivity as it is to quit activity ones, sometimes, what with ignition requiring more fuel than idling.  And I have a bunch of stuff to fix these days.  I'm gonna spend some time in L.A. taking classes, acting (and of course continue writing-related stuff) before I move to NY, and I need to streamline and simplify the whole operation before heading down there in July.  It's just less than four months away, and Jeez, what a mess!  My gifts are not in the order and orginazion realm.  And with the exception of my long visit to Ireland in 2001, I don't historically plan ahead for these drop-off-the-cliff ventures.  Once I decide I'm doing something, I just put on my tennies and jump.  I love the seizing the day part, and I always seem to land on my feet (or am somehow able to struggle to them), but I've learned how sweet it is to have a few extra bucks in your pocket first, have a Meridiani Planum at which to aim one's Rover.  At some point I'll fill you in on how and why I came to decide to move to NY and permanently leave my hometown of Seattle. There's a mix of reasons, happy, sad and otherwise.   And...time to quit smoking (again).

      I wonder what else I can do with this thing.    My friend Mary Pat just asked whether I'd seen The Passion of the Christ, yet.  I haven't, and I've been wondering whether I could or want to.  I've been having a similar discussion with my dad.  All of the above were brought up Catholic, MP and I having met at age 5 at Catholic grade school (We're now 35.  As of September of this year, we'll have known eachother a full thirty years. Shit, that was fast!).  But I'd be coming at it from the perspective of someone who drew away from a lot of it very early on.    And I'd also be coming at it as someone who has a hard enough time watching a kid get his booster shot on a med segment of the news, let alone a drawn out viewing of someone experiencing pain.  I sympathize immediately and very deeply with people, identifying.  It's reflexive, and I'm glad to have the quality. I love for a person to know I'm "with" them so they don't feel lonely and not understood on top of hurt, whatever the nature of the hurt. When I'm not there, and just seeing an image of it, I can hardly bear that, because I can't do anything.    So I can imagine Mel Gibson arguing that, literally for Christ's sake, that's the least I could do.  That's the whole point, to put you in touch with the experience he felt he had to have for the sake of others.  Going through the Stations of the Cross on Good Friday has broken my heart.  I remember crying at age nineteen or so, having fully realized the process as his very real, human, bodily experience and without the odd remove I had had since childhood.  They don't spell it all out when you're six, And I guess you keep that filter up until it's knocked away purposefully.  I'd like to know the movie had a greater good (besides the one inherent in the story), something that could help heal me up after seeing all the vicious violence.  Do you see the resurrection? Is there any great sense of Jesus' love that it leaves you with?  I haven't heard about it, if so, and I've read tons of reviews.  Is all this is a matter of hitting you over the head with how extreme the torture was?  Does asking questions like that say something about myself I don't really care for?  Do I see this film?  Stay tuned...

      Bon Apres Midi.  Ok, I'm quitting smoking for good, meaning the rest of my days here on the planet, on April Fools' Day.  I figure, that's perfectly fitting, what with having smoked and continuing to smoke, knowing what kind of damage it does.  I have a plan, a strategy, the will (God knows), and some nicotine patches. I'll be buying some more on Monday when I get paid, along with a truckload of crisp, tasty Jona Gold apples and some fresh new workout clothes.  I really tend to slam myself for this (having such a hard time quitting) and some other crap I'm not good at, which is doing me no good, so I'm also attempting to make that big boat come about. On board is this ridiculously prohibitive sense of "well, if you're gonna do such a great job, now, why couldn't you have done so before, why not by now have a history of the good habits? Can you really be different? I don't buy it.  There's nothing so much more special about this moment than the previous ones. You were no less capable before, you're no more capable, now."  It's like there's this squashing force intent on keeping me and my unwanted ways and behaviors the way they are, by being derisive with me and trying to undercut my confidence.  There are times when I  mean  to keep my confidence in check; this is not one of them.  An unbidden beastie, swirling around my head like a creeping cloud of fucking smoke.  I need to be encouraging and positive, just like I would be with another person.

      How do you do? The above greeting is pronounced SLAN-tchuh, more or less, and means Cheers.   urlLink Happy St. Patrick's Day!  I grew up in an Irish-Scottish household, and my "sport", rather than soccer, say, was competitive Irish dancing. This was hundreds of years before Riverdance popularized it.  The Gavaghan School still exists, still taught by Marie herself, and she doesn't look a day over 47.  Which is stunning, math-wise: I'm 35 and entered her class at age six in 1974, at which point she had long since achieved her Masters in Education and was well into adulthood.  She was to be my third grade teacher (her best pal, Sr. Cabrini, was my first grade teacher), but transferred up closer to where she lived in '75.  But she continued to coach at Assumption, my gradeschool, some evenings.  I myself am not Irish.  I was adopted. I was excited to get to know who I am, bio-family-wise, in 1993, and it was fun seeing how much sense the following makes: on my mother's side I am Norwegian and German, and on my father's side I'm French and Inuit. I look like a light person with a dark aspect, or vice versa. If someone can tell me, a technophuckup, how to stick this picture of myself [C:\WINDOWS\DESKTOP\My Pictures\cafecath1.jpg] into the template of my blog or whatever, I'll do that, and in the next post you can link to this little picture.    I have identified with Irishness and did have a torrid affair with it awhile back. I spent most of 2001 in Ireland, having a blast and steeping myself in the language, culture and history. And literature. God, there was a time I was reading nothing but Irish authors and couldn't get enough of it.  There is a certain dark strain of clever humor to be found in most Irish writing that sticks to your bones like a trowelful of wet clay, and I loved finding it.  But you know, Níl aon tintéan mar do thintéan féin (there's no place like home), such as it is at present, and I'm glad to be back.

      Good Afternoon.  Yesterday was was a blastx2 - first Mary Pat and I went to see  urlLink Secret Window   , where Aimee H. found us.  We chatted and ate, then Mary Pat and Colleen found the three of us and we went to see  urlLink Starsky & Hutch , and a fun time was had by all. Woo! Very good job on the Gran Torino.   Secret Window was even better than I anticipated, and it's clear to me why now that I've read the website.  A great deal of thought went into the crafting of this flick, and the director  urlLink David Koepp  has hit perfectly the balance between design and spontaneity.  Although one of the joys of being a director is seeing what pops up during the process, I would imagine that because of all the variables shifting around and the possibility of a critical one ending up completely out of whack - back ot the drawing board - it can be difficult to let up of the reins of one's design (and the one for this shoot was prepared extremely well).  Bravo to Koepp!   Let's see, what else?  Nothin' right now? okay, see you soon.

      Hullo.  I'm working overtime all weekend (yay for cash, boo for no time to do anything fun).  But just before I go, if I win my little bid, I'll be buying a present for myself off Ebay.  I've never done Ebay, before, so we'll see if I've got the hang of it.   I've been casting about for answers to the problems of my day to day life for weeks upon weeks (and to be honest, even longer), problems exacerbated to a wretched mess due to my stupid schedule. It's actually a vicious cycle:  Crappy Schedule=>Depression=>Crappy Schedule seems like an even bigger deal=>Worse Depression=>Sleep Trouble=>Now Crappy Schedule Can go Fuck Itself And Burn In Pit Of Hell=>No Life Outside Work and Sleep=>Much Worse Depression=>You Get The Idea.    Well, I'll have this exact schedule until I leave in July, and I can't just sit around and mope about it and wish it were different.  I'm leaving in July, ready or not.  So I have to work  with  the stupid schedule,  somehow ; get out of the house and run errands, get organized, get ready, pare things down, get moving.  I have long-haul motivation, but I'm having trouble being excited from day to day, which is what the long haul is made of.  So.  I'm seeing a line in the sand, because the end of July is very fast approaching. I want my life and self to be in order and healthy, or well on the way, before then, so I can leave feeling terrific and excited, rather than disappointed and ill-prepared.  To end on a happy, hopeful note: I got a re-issue of my permit.  I'm gonna go take the written test this coming week, and schedule a driving test for the following Monday. That's a day that works great for both Aimee H., who's car she is graciously letting me use *kisskissAimee*, and me. She'll take me for a practice jaunt and test me herself before we head toe the DMV.  WIth any luck and hopefully a bit of skill, I will, at the tender age of 35, finally be a licensed motor vehicle operator!  Say me a prayer (who's the patron saint of cars and driving?) and wish me lotsa luck.

      I love making new internet pals.  My new fave is Shabaas at  urlLink lobudget.com .  He's a kick, very smart and creative, very funny. He's a HouseBoy, damnit. Plus there's this adorable photo of little kids (HouseBoyz?) partying down on the homepage of his site.  We're having a great art/commerce discussion at CRC's site.  I love hearing what those guys in the know have to say.  I have a better idea of the dynamics of that subject in the publishing industry, where (maddeningly) authors are still routinely asked to stray from the original truth of their work, their vision, for the sake of marketability.  It's heartbreaking if the artist bows and compromises beyond a point that would be acceptable for him for whatever reason (but especially if that reason is youth/inexperience), and the reasons behind the houses' requests are heartbreaking (dollars! massiveness of audience! futures!) when you know they originally entered that industry for the love of good books and stories.    But the tide is turning with self-publishing options and the internet and alternative means of distribution (exactly analagous with the film industry, evidently).  But you know, I also know that the big guys are not against you to the core. Not adversaries, and money is not the only thing they are capable of seeing.  Given those things, I have some faith that, between the big guys and the little, and especially if those two factions communicate and even collaborate, arts in this country is on a healthy track, and I'm excited to be becoming a part of it.

      Here's my journal entry from early this morning:  Good Morning. Believe it or not,  it’s 8:32 am [a time at which I am very rarely awake].  But that’s because I haven’t been to sleep yet, and  that’s  because I lost my keys.  Why that is, I don’t know.  I did get out miraculously early [in the afternoon] yesterday and ran some errands, including the SCL bill at Key Tower.  I got my permit renewed, got some more nicotine patches, went to the drug store and the Market (lovely Champagne mangoes).  Somewhere alone the line, I lost the keys.  Thank God I didn’t lose the work keys; if I was gonna lose keys, I lost the right fuckin' keys. Jeez.  Also thank God I had money, the Hurricane [and grocery store] to go to, that I’m used to staying up til morning, that I was in such a lovely mood that I didn’t get strained or upset, that I had my backpack/normal clothes/notebook&pen.  Thank God I had Mike [apartment maintenance guy] to call and that he knew right away of my predicament.  He was expecting me at 7:30 outside the building this morning, ready to let me in.  He will be going to copy my keys just after nine (and then I can finally sleep!).  All I kept thinking is how much worse things could’ve been, and thank God they weren't.  Oh, and here’s some more terrificness:  At the cafe, I wrote out a scene for my novel, the one where Joe gives Rose the [paper sack] and they nearly get caught.  Wow, something, finally.  Keep it up, now! -end-  update:  I just woke up at 4p, went to Michael's (the little store behind my building) for coffee, and as I was walking back I ran into my landlady.  I had left a message on her answering machine just before paging Mike the maintenance guy last night, so she knew what was going on.  She said, "Guess what, I've got your keys! You left them in your mailbox yesterday and someone brought them up to me".  Oh.  Good grief!  I'm homeless all night and pay Michael $20 for a new set, wait til after nine to sleep til he brings 'em to me, and...the whole time...*laughs*, shyte.  My server was down this morning, too, when I got home, and I was bummed thinking something was permanently wrong (misleading error message).  I'm so glad I tried again and now it's fine.

      In just a bit, I'll be leaving the house to go see my friend-cum-driving instructor, Aimee.  I didn't have to take a written driving exam because they were able to use my score from the test I took to get my permit (yay). We scheduled a drive test for Wednesday morning at 9:25. Hoo. Well, off for some practice, then work.  I took tomorrow night off to go see Thoroughly Modern Milly with Mary Pat and her family. I'll give you a review. Btw, not smoking, but I do get some serious moments when I just about blow it.  But the Patch is a Godsend.

      I'm more miserable with my stuffiness than with not smoking.  The Patch helps enormously, but getting to where smoking doesn't even occur to me that often will be so great.  I slept til just about now, today, because I have to stay up until possibly 10 or 11a, tomorrow, depending on how crowded it is at the West Seattle DMV. I figure even on a Friday, it wont be so bad just as they're opening their doors.  I'll be looking over the rules or the road, at work this eve.  Wish me luck.

      I really love it when people make me think, especially when they are way fuckin' cool people.  That's how I would humbly begin to describe  urlLink Earnest , who left a great comment yesterday.  It's  under  the "No, No, not Shazbot" entry.  read that, and then here's what I got to thinking:   The sentence Earnest began, “But the problem has never been the art but..." is a sentence I would’ve finished like this, “...the mood and whims of the populace these days.”  My gut resists idea that quality is a number-of-artists thing. I want to think that just as a booming population doesn’t lower the quality of individual human, neither do more artists lower the quality of pieces of work.  I think whether a thing does well, whether that means it made through the big gatekeepers’ doors or whether buzz developed independently, has to do just as well if not more so with the whim and mood of the recipients as whether it’s “good” by whatever measure/standard one could try to impose.  That’s art for ya. The artists who do well (or not) , I think one could generally safely say, are doing precisely what they’re doing regardless of how many peers they have  in the same branch of the arts or whether their audience is 10 or 5,000,000.  That’s artists for ya.   I think that in business, quality stagnates when there’s a dearth of competitors and is stimulated by newcomers. The only quality issue is  when some quick-buck Joe comes along and does cheap knockoffs of whatever they were producing. There may generally speaking may be saturation point at which any additional participants are superfluous, but they wouldn’t do any (quality-wise) harm.   I know businesses and individual people are not consistently analogous,  but I think that’s one strain of comparison that works.  Artists products are shaped by individual-isms.  All art, no matter how much of it nor how many people making it, is still ultimately a subjective endeavor.  How many great artists can there be? As many as can be loved and called that by the populace.  This is not baseball, where there is a finite number of job openings.  If you truly entertain, you’re welcome.    God, there's so much to say about this! And I didn't even address all the elements of Earnest's comment that I wanted to. And who knows, maybe I'm missing an important idea and/or I'll end up disagreeing with myself. In any case, thanks  urlLink Earnest .  Your brain rocks.

      Well, I've been truly great at skipping smokes and substituting them with apples and other stuff, notably fortune cookies.  T-45 hours.  Please send some good thoughts my way. Really! I believe in good, supportive energy from others. It works. It helps. I feel it.  In a related story, I have curiously timed sinus infection.  A whopping pain in the ass, to be sure, but it makes smoking very unpleasant and irritating, so cigarettes are that much easier to skip.  It has also brought down my energy, though.    I did go out this afternoon and enjoy the gorgeous weather we had today, weather worth mentioning for this town (Seattle).  75 and sunny all afternoon!  I stopped by Old Navy (puke-tastic ads and image, but usually excellent cheap shyte) and got four new t-shirts. I have to remind myself that this does NOT excuse me from doing laundry.  Of course, nothing really does (serve as an acceptable excuse), yet I somehow never do it, anyway. Ah, yes, welcome to my glamourous life.   Welp, see ya soon.

      Jeez, sorry it's been so long.  I'm alive.  Not smoking is making me want to sleep too much, so I've been indulging that a bit; I've got some Black Dog stuff going on as well.  I don't work this Saturday, so I'm gonna go drive with Aimee and then knock back a couple with her.  After that, I'm finally ( finally , I've been looking forward to this for  months ) gonna go to a late screening of Eternal Sunshine.

      Musical theater - not my usual cup of tea, taste-wise, although I always appreciate the enormous effort and talent.  That said, Thoroughly Modern Millie was the most fun of that type of experience I've ever had, overall. The sets and costumes were smashing, the singing was excellent, the lead girl was the perfect personality and energy - great cast all around. The part of Mrs. Meers was overacted and annoying, the only notable drawback. It was the only play I've ever seen with subtitles- hysterical, very cleverly done.  Me-wise, it was alot of fun hanging out with Mary Pat, Colleen and their dad; my dad, who was supposed to go, was conspicuously missing.  But we'll make up for that in the near future at 'the Burg'.  All of us'll get together for lunch.  Okay, on to more pressing matters, such as Driving!  I love driving! Love! The other day with Aimee I felt like I crossed the threshold from not really a driver who sometimes attempted, permit timidly in hand, to drive a car, to A Driver.  I was really determined to get comfortable with it. Not unrealistically, like suddenly feel like I'd had years of practice, but get to where I was more excited than apprehensive.  I get the kind of experience Saturday with Aimee that scored me some real confidence. She's a perfect presence for me, neither overly nor insufficiently directive, her vibe was easy and cool.  Her car's the perfect car, because it's not a touchy, hyper-responsive car (I don't feel as in-control with one of those, yet), yet it's a good little car.  My drive test is Wednesday at 9:25am.  Wish me luck!  Speaking of Aimee-related stuff, I believe I have a new kitty!  Aimee's cat had kittens, recently, and they are the most adorable baby kitties you have ever seen. But one in particular just caught me, and I connected.  She has the sweetest little expression (we think it's a she), and whereas the other ones were a bit squirmy, this one liked sitting in my hand and hanging out with me. She even gave me kisses and came back to find me when I put her back in her little dresser-drawer home.  I've been thinking of her often, heavily considering taking her with me to California.  I've decided that if it's at all possible, and it's all good with Aimee, I will.  My Puddy Tat.  I'm still all patched up and (miraculously) not smoking.  But I miss it, I'm sleeping too much, and I generally wish I were further along already.  Thank God for the Patch, but this is still hardly a piece of cake.

      Sorry I've taken so long. Yeah, I've been busy with car possibilities and an ex bf-type-person and juggling bills and to-do lists regarding goin' ta Cali, but none of it really serves as an excuse.  I check my email every day, I can at least say hi to you guys and get stuff thought through while I'm at it.  I am trying to make a decision: Do I buy a car now and have a bad-ass road trip with Aimee and possibly Amy and hopefully Puddy Tat ( I found a place that will do her shots and a health screening for cheep, and they had great advice for road-trippin' kitties), or do I fly down and get a car once I'm there?  I can take Puddy if I fly, I just have to find out how much extra it is and buy a little carrier thingy.   A) It would be great to have the car already.   I'm looking at a couple and have test driven one, an old Honda, which I can afford to buy outright.  It passed muster with the ex bf-type-person, who knows his way around a car. He reported I'd need CV joints in the next 6-8 months, but that this was acceptable given the good deal I'd be getting.  It'd be great to be keeping my hand in driving over the next couple months, and be already all insured and AAAed, getting used to filling 'er up and topping up oil and the whole I'm-a-driver-now routine. And a road trip would be kick-ass.   B) It would be great not to have the expense, yet.    I'm also pretty sure my overall expense would be less if I flew, even with Puddy Tat.  I have first, last and deposit to save out, an impending 1800 GOT JUNK bill and other moving money to consider.  It'd be nice to keep stuff very simple, and get the car as a separate project once I've arrived.  So?  I'll be feeling it out for a while, but the deal on this Honda is sticky sweet.

      I get all these great ideas of stuff to talk about here, then hours later, I get home and...poof. So, I got an adorable little red notebook.  We have learned our lesson and have rid ourselves of the poof factor.    Aimee H., who for over a decade has had hair that comes down to roughly four and a half feet below sea level, got whacked (the hair)!  Now she's all swingy and gorgeous.  She was gorgoeus, before, of course, but it's sorta like hitting refresh all over when you get such a dramatic change.  You take a whole new look at the person.  What else? ah, ok, I have a new email address.  I guess all Blogger-brand blog people got an offer to test drive Google's new web-based email service, and I bit.  I've always been as happy as most people are with Google's stuff, so I took a look at it and liked it better immediately.  I'll change it on the sidebar. It's:  cath68@gmail.com  I like seeing my first name, too, that's a nice change.  I already transferred you guys into that address book.

      Did I ever mention that I finally saw  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ?  urlLink Charlie Kaufman , who's name I always want to mistakenly put two letter f's in, is my movie writing hero.  He does nothing but get better each time.  One of my measures of a great story is if it keeps coming back to me, like a little ghost following me around and tapping me on the shoulder every once in awhile. Well, this one's sitting next to me on the couch as we speak.  I guess by 'better', I mean richer, more interesting, more genuine, insightful. I think he does what he feels like; he doesn't write thinking of 'box office', he writes thinking of his story, the characters, tight crafting and all that that means, and  truth  to human experience. I have intense respect for artists who follow what they feel like doing, and who can be open listeners (to those whom they would work) with without compromising what is truly sacred to them. And what's truly sacred to CK really sings to me.  I'm a big fan. I couldn't wait for whatever was next after  urlLink Adaptation , and I can't wait to see what he comes up with, now.

      I got a wonderful email from Earnest in response to my last entry.  I definitely need to look up some words and bone up on critical thinking, and I'm just grateful to be reminded.  I think my ideas sometimes (or possibly often :P) end up being Charlie Brown Kites. But I love to keep trying. I'll definitely revisit that discussion, I love challenges like that. Today was an awesome comic strip day. I laughed out loud like five or six times (I'm a huge comic strip fan). What else? not a terribly remarkable day, I guess, just checking in. Blogging's therapeutic even if you can't get much to happen.

      Here’s an excerpt from E-Rock's (I hereby love E-Rock) blog, referring originally to our lastest Pledge of Allegiance protester.  I have broken it into sections and addressed stuff section by section. Except after while my sense of order slipped a bit and I just kind of barged in. In any case, Earnest's words are in regular script, mine are italicized:    1)    I have a problem with removing God from the civic equation. The problem is that the Declaration of Independence, the foundation on which our nation was built, declares that man is endowed by a Creator with unalienable rights. In philosophical terms, if you remove a Creator from the equation, then there can be no inalienable rights as all rights are then endowed by the state or asserted by the individual.   I don't agree that then there can be no inalienable rights; I think that, much like homesteadable property by an individual, a state can simply claim or declare them.  ‘Endowed by a Creator’ – that language – would seem to require belief in God  by each individual in the sovereign nation.  Could a reasonable party of the state (or any reasonable party) decide that a given individual’s lack of belief in A Creator/God render him excluded of these inalienable rights?  [An analogous question would be, if a disenfranchised person ran around declaring he was no longer American, would that simply become the case; would he no longer be entitled, say, to due process?] Well that would be, as JMV would say, just silly.  So what we have here, I think, is a language problem (assuming we can agree that humans have inalienable rights). Well, I love language problems. Give me a minute…    ["Humanity infers basic inalienable rights"? Well, I think I'd better go look up 'infer' but you get the idea. Or how bout this: "Basic inalienable rights are intrinsic to Humanity"?]    2)     If the rights are endowed by the state, then once the state dissolves, so do those basic rights   (bold mine - I'll refer to this, later - Cath) . Man can not assert those rights for himself because there would be inevitable inequality in the rights people asserted for themselves.    Well, assume belief in God: how is that ultimately any less arbitrary than individual assertion? What exactly would we all be agreeing to, and how could we possibly ensure that [whatever the answer is] would be cool with every last individual/group? Trouble begins with the very terms Creator, God. I’m really asking about addressing the subjectivity problem inherent and relevent to the issue of beliefs and faith in God vis a vis a state that avows distiction of itself from religion as a whole for the sake of inclusiveness of all individuals.  The USA does not require an individual to compromise himself for it in this regard.  OK, that could be less wordy, sorry.   3) Finally, you might argue that existence alone is enough to retain certain basic rights, but that isn't true, either. Existence alone can not come with inalienable rights because lots of things exist that don't have those rights.     A) I’d make a distinction of rights especially designed for humans in the case of drafting a document specifically regarding a human endeavor. B) Although I may make your argument, I wouldn’t use that reasoning. I may, as a drafter of a Constitution, for example, simply take my prerogative to “declare” it. I might also start nitpicking with my cronies at the meaning of “right”.     Basic rights must be provided by an ultimate source, so the authors of the Declaration of Independence smartly attributed God  * - It was smart, and culturally prudent in that era to presume faith in God... - this is me barging in, here -Cath*  as that source, while declaring that governments had the responsibility to protect those rights. But... While it doesn't really promote religion, there is no good reason to have "In God We Trust" printed on money or to include "under god" in the pledge of allegiance. The question I have is whether there is a compelling enough reason to remove them, and right now I don't think so.  *A compelling reason  may well be that it is no longer culturally prudent to presume faith in God.  An increasing number of people in an increasingly secular society have explicated freedom FROM religion/God faith from erstwhile quiet implication in the phrase “freedom of religion”.  Or so I believe we could safely interpret The Constitution, given its full respect to individual life. Certainly it doesn’t explicitly preclude non-(God) belief. -Cath*  I just don't think those words, in those cases, are an attempt to advertise a religious doctrine.  * that isn’t the point . If anything, they're tradition like those stupid robes that you have to wear at graduation though they've long since become irrelevant.  *inadequate analogy    Well, I doubt I’m done with this, because this sort of discussion is fascinating for me first of all, and second of all, those two asterisked phrases just above, here, were spots I meant to fill out with actual ideas rather than blind critique. But I got sorta sleepy.  So nighty night.  Oh, but the phrase in bold, above. I see that as being simply true, regardless.  If the state dissolves? We haven't got a prayer. Or that's all we have.

      I made a deliberate point from time to time, when I was growing up, to sear important stuff to memory.  Impressions, emotions, the experience, whatever was important.  I pride myself on a long, sharp memory, and I am very practiced at resisting imposing my adulthood and what I know now onto those memories.  It's very important ot me that I don't corrupt them.  I love and respect that kid, she deserves to be who she was and accepted by me free of my adult conditions and conditioning.  And I mine that purer mind for evreything from material for what I write to lenses through which to look at various stuff, today.    However.   It seems I'm out of touch with very small children, and what is important to them, and that bothers me.  I am NOT a 'kid person'.  I deeply respect and deeply love children and childhood, the sacredness.  But the day to day stuff has never appealed to me, even as a kid: the sillier modern toys, the embarrasingly pandersome speech of strange adults ('ooooOOOO, HIIIiiii, little giiiiIIIIRrl?!, Who's a  nice  little girl!), and just the very condition of someone else being responsible for me - and  with  me on some level at nearly all times.  I really like reading and imagining stuff by myself, and wanted to be left alone.  I did like Jamie and really liked playing with him, but that's different, he's my brother, and we weren't constantly hangin out.    But I digress.  A couple of little kids, age four or five, greeted me, yesterday.  I've seen these kids every now and then, have smiled at them (they live in my buidling), but we'd never had the pleasure of being introduced.  They said hi, I said hi, and since I was on my way out, I smiled and continued to the stairs.  But then the more outgoing of the two caught up with me and said with proud enthusiasm: "So my name is Lily!"  The other kid, smaller and shyer, smiled big and said nothing,  but looked like he wanted to .  I said to Lily, "pretty name! My name is Catherine. See you later!" and continued walking.  And here's the entirely fucked-up adult thing my brain did, next, it thought: "if the other kid feels like introducing himself, he will".  I'll get back to this.  Here's how I cope with my fellow adults and adult friends.  I don't ask about the important, touchy stuff, nor most other stuff, for that matter, unless I'm being asked to ask.  I go on the assumption that they will tell me what they need or want for me to know.  This is an ingrained respect-habit.  I love my friends and accept everyone, I respect their inner and personal lives by taking only what they offer and handling that with extreme care.  How is it that I let this old habit extend to a pre-schooler, and apply to something like whether he wants my attention?  If you're a little kid, you're EXCUSED from having to drum up whatever it takes inside you to ask me for time or attention.  I could weep with shame.  He did do it, this shy boy, as soon as I reached the stairwell door, he said, "Hey! Hi! my name is Joey!"  I looked at him for a while with a smile, hoping to make up for myself, hoping he'll forgive me for being an adult.

      There is nothing like getting exactly the food you wish you were eating.   Once in awhile, there is only one thing for me to do: go to  urlLink Il Fornaio , and ask for a steaming bowl of Quattro Formaggi Gnocchi.  Their's is the best I've ever eaten, and it's not easy getting the texture just right with something like potato dumplings.  But Il Fornaio must have some perfect formula for getting it just so, every time. Light without falling apart, but toothsome. Two will nearly fill your mouth, and the formaggi is just gorgeous.  I always get this with a hefeweisen (my fave anyway) and sometimes with a crispy salad.  I think that's my comfort food meal.

      We take requests here at LaughingSky Headquarters, and I do believe I heard  urlLink somebody  say "poem or short story".  K, we got your back, as we are primarily here to entertain you (and ourselves); ask and you shall receive.  I wonder if you guys wouldn't mind helping me come up with a title? This is almost never a problem for L.S., we have a beautiful Title Muse.  But now and then, she leaves us on our own, and we have the hardest time. Nothing seems just right.  The following came to me after thinking on long-haul history after having read about an archeological dig (You'll note that M. de Ste. Exupery made his way into this work.  Usually content to permeate my life and work lightly, like a lovely early morning fog, he does show up rather literally once in a while. You may also detect a certain Mr. R. Frost smiling in the distance):    Two sides of of sacred, fleeting Earth One end of time, the other So many thousand years ago, A peaceful, pleased and aged man Peers deep in to the ancient night, And prays...  The inky sky will echo back, with  Laughing, shining jewels and say: I'll fill the little Vessel in your hands, now, Human Man For you're to come forever after Home.   I'll place the rhythms of your time And all the music in your mind The magic of your stories and your wisdom, in your Cup;  The colors of your family, and  Richness of your seasons, the  Passion of your heady dreams, and Wishes lost, inside;  The musings of your closest friends, Your banter by the evening fire, the  Pieces of your lives and  Love you keep, I'll place inside;  All your riches settle  In the Cup of blackened stone The essence of your Soul Will keep, inside.  II  So many thousand years go, since, and I, I'm walking westward there, surprised To find I stumble in the road.   Underneath my hands,  What do I see as I get up,  But the glinting of the sun Upon a little blackened Cup.  I feel compelled to sit beside the  Road and hold it still,  and as I do the rhythms of  his life inside me spill;   The magic of his stories  and the wisdom of his years...  I sense the ancient seasons And my eyes sting now with tears  I look into a sunlit sky and Hear a whisper soft; An echo of a message to a Soul long since aloft.  I hold the Vessel high above  My head, eons gone by, and  Wonder who I am to have this  Present from the sky.

      I bumped off, aka whacked, my lastest attempt at an audblog.  I tried using the speakerphone on my cell, and it's so fuzzy and faint you can't make me out.  I mentioned that was one of the things I was testing, and I mentioned that I'm really still feeling this process out...  I had a story in mind to tell.  I thought, for my next audio trick, I'd tage-team CRC and say a memory from when I was a kid.  A current thing I saw triggered a corresponding thing from the past, something I might not have stumbled across if it weren't for that present-day stimulus - I  think  that's what he means by 'sense memory'.  Well, maybe I'll try it again, but another thing I've discovered is that spontenaity may work better.  I have a whole system of some sort, a compostion reservoir sort of like a Word notepad, I guess, set up in my brain for chewing over what I'm going to  write , but I discovered that it doesn't apply to  speaking  (for me, anyway) at all.  But I actually think this is great; I'm gonna learn a whole new thing, a fundamentally different way to document my thoughts outwardly.  It's different than day-to-day conversation because it's a journal, but it's different than what I've ever thought of as filling in a journal because it's me  talking .  Well, I write it out and it sounds so obvious, but I really hadn't thought about it much yet.  So, on we go...  I'm excited to keep trying this.  I'll call in, again, very soon (and will forgo using the speakerphone fuction)  :P

      Well, it's actually evening, but whatever.  I really just like the rhythm and sound of that mid-day greeting: bone-a pray-me dee.    So Shabaas started audio blogging, or as I call it (in his case), blaudio ogging. I think I feel inspiration coming on...  This is a writing thing for me, and I like the process of putting fingertips to keyboard, but why not open up the Audio Option?  The more I think about it, the more it just sounds like a fun way to do this.  Sooo, maybe next time you hear from me, you'll literally be hearing from me.  We'll see.

      It's all good, I didn't get any new creepy email, and everything else checks out ok, so I bet it was just a one-time thing, a nasty wink.   Don't get me wrong, I'm still taking a nice break - the more I thought about it, yesterday, the more good reasons I found to do that.  I found some other shit to take a break from, too.  But I'll be back soon.  (I told Shabaas I'd send him an email, today, in response to the comment he left just as I was getting ready to go home, yesterday.  So I'm online right now for a few more minutes.)  I'll be back in a week or so.    :)

      My gut has settled, now that I've finished writing this, and I'm sure everything is or will be just fine.  There's too much alarm in my 'voice' in the following, just sidestep that a little, please :)   I just braced myself to see my blog hacked and messed up.  My gut sank when I opened my email - both accounts, hotmail just now and gmail earlier. There was a little present in each one contrived to frighten me, and it worked.  I'm relieved to see that this person has not caught on that this is my blog, and that it seems to be a safe spot.    But although I know this spells a bit of a victory for whoever this is, I'm gonna take a nice break from online life for a small while, probably a week-10days.  I need to get this in perspective - I believe (hope) only my online life is affected, not my physical one, so.  I have laundry to do, a house to clean, two stories to focus on writing (I do the first notes and drafts longhand, anyway), a body to excersize, etc.  I'm just gonna take some time for those things, and forget this, clear my head.  It's just the computer.  To shed some light:  All I have are guesses. But the timing gives weight to my guesses.  I guess this is a lady, and the hotmail address these came from is feminine.  I strongly believe it's someone I've never met.    One of my fellow bloggers recently removed some stuff from his website, and my speculation - only speculation, I could be completely wrong - is that it has something to do with that.  I was able to get the gist of why he removed this stuff, but I don't know any specifics.  But it was stuff written by someone else, and I bet that someone else was hotly pissed off. Maybe still IS hotly pissed off.    I think he (fellow blogger) removed the stuff earlier yesterday (?); these emails were sent to me later, yesterday.  They were very skillfully and cleverly contrived.  They had the effect of my worry intensifying the more I thought about them, they had me doing the morally uncomfortable work of finding the best way to handle this. They have me a bit paranoid to send emails, and I'm not looking at my email accounts until my head clears.    I'm not fool enough to bank on my blog remaining intact and undiscovered, because to do what she did with my email would take tech savvy I didn't even know existed. But I'm crossing my fingers and hoping you guys read this soon.  I'm the furthest thing from a tech-head, so I could very well be overreacting. I don't know enough to know.  In any case, I'll be back soon, because I get over shit very well and I would miss you guys after too long.  ~Catherine

      My computer is in the repair shop, where it belongs! Finally.  I have an abiding special place in my heart for payday.  By Tuesday, I'll be back in business for reals, no more of this pit-stop, hope-I-get-time-to-look-at-other-blogs bullshit.  Which is not to say I don't fully appreciate the cafes. On the contrary, I don't know what I'd have done without them.  Guess what else? the repair guy sold me a wi-fi card that will definitely work in my 83 year old Compaq Armada.  I think I'm gonna celebrate by getting a new carrying thingy for it.  I wonder if they make backpacks that accomodate laptops, now.

      Please get off your damn cellular telephone.  Are you in a quiet cafe? Are you in the symphony lobby?  Are people around you working, resting, waiting quietly? Even snoozing? Maybe they just got their little one to nod off. Maybe they are trying to hear something else. Something that is at far lower decibels than your chirpy-ass larynx, like what the person standing right by their side is trying to say to them, for example. Hey, nobody wants to seem uncaring or anything, but NOONE GIVES A SHIT WHAT RODNEY IN ACCOUNTING IS DOING FOR DINNER. Thankyou.

      Jeez.  I called and smiled and said to the guy, "Hi, I'm having some trouble with the Wi-Fi card I bought from you guys, yesterday?  I followed the instructions, [blah blah blah], couldn't get it to show any signal info, even when there definitely was a signal. Can you help me figure this out?"  His response (I am not making this up): "Uh...No..nope. Listen, I'll send you a worksheet in an email, and if that doesn't help, you might get a friend to help you."  Silence.  I said, "If it doesn't work, I'll call you back."  There was more that I didn't say.  The monotone in his voice was amazing. Jeez. I'm considering asking to do "Mango", instead, or if maybe we can get some "Bryan Fellows".  At least those guys say hi and shit.  You know who I'm really Jonesin' for right now? Drunk Girl. I love Drunk Girl.

      A family thing that is way more fun is my real mom, Mary Ray.  I used to be a little more PC with my language and say 'biological' mom or whatever, but 'real' works for me. It feels right, true.  She rocks. I met her just over eleven years ago. My real father, Robert Taylor Thach (yes, that's the correct spelling - I've anglicized it myself, for the same reasons as I say 'real' mom) passed on in '79, and although I was heartbroken not to have met him, I got some great cool stories about him. He was a dark, tall bad-ass sweetheart trucker who lost his fight to keep me and went on to (starting immediately!) have three more gorgeous children with Mary: my sisters Trinity, 34, and Sarah, 32, and my brother Noah, 29. He was very concerned about having as much fun as possible (I am  definitely  my father's daughter), and he just thought being a father would be a lot of fun. He had me named Julie, and he needed to go by Papa. I'm psychic or something, because I just knew that last part the whole time I was growing up and thought of my dad as Dad and him as Papa.  He was drop-your-jaw gorgeous.   I will get pictures up of them ASAP, btw, but it is kinda hard to get us busy folk all together.

      Part The First:  See, the thing is, I didn't exactly die.  About a year or so after I left home at 17 (I ran away then got a court order for Emancipation), I had some angry phone contact with my mom, Barbara.  We had had such a spirit-killing go of it during my growing up that whatever might have been there connecting us just broke entirely.  She said of my leaving home that it was like a cancer had been excised from the body of our family, and now it was healed, and thriving.  She said she was grieving as though I died.  I said, I don't think it's me in particular you're grieving for. We hung up. We haven't talked to eachother since then, and I'm now thirty-five.  I haven't physically seen her since June of 1986, just after graduating highschool.  My opinion of her mentally having "me" "die" is not too good; I think it makes a mockery of the searing pain of moms who's children actually are gone, moms who would kill for a single hour of the many thousands my mom has had of me being available and in the flesh since I left home.  And that opinion of mine is typical: vehement moral disagreement with her worldview and approaches, etc..  I do talk with my dad on the phone, and see him every few weeks or so for coffee.  We talk about the weather, the Civil War (he's a buff), their activities at church, etc..  They are still married, I'm sure they always will be.  I've conceived of my dad as little more than an innocent and somewhat hapless bystander to the turbulence that marred the growing-up years.  I'm grateful and moved to have what I have with him, some time, some ability to relate and get along, some cool memories.    But times, they is a-changin'.   In the years between 1986 and now, I've taken care with the sensibilities of my parents, as I perceive them.  It's been clear that my door is open, though out of respect to myself, hesitant.  I have thought (recently confirmed rightly) that it would be happy for my dad if we made some sort of peace and resolution and became an intact family once again.  However, the forecast is not looking too good, now (ok, well, it never did), and I'm currently at a crossroads, almost literally.    This is a bunch to read all at once, and I'm pretty sure it's not too exciting for you guys, so for those of you who have made it this far, I'll at least break it into parts.  In the next chapter, I'll explain the bleak outlook.   Part the second, coming up.

      Jeez, but this thing needs work.  I looked at Black Heron, the story that just got sent off, and I really need to tinker with it.  There're a couple wholesale mistakes, one of which renders an entire paragraph confusing and distracting. There's an area that could use more fleshing out.  There are little things like typos and shit.   I'm just glad I indicated that I realized it could use a little reworking in an email to the recipient, and that there's plenty of time to do that. I want to take the entire weekend off from even  thinking  of it, let alone looking at it.  Monday, I'll have as fresh of eyeballs as possible, and really sit down and get it precisely right for publication.    P.S., if any of you guys wanna read it already, and you're either a) willing to open an email attachment or, b) willing to give me a mailing address, I'll be happy to get you a copy.  I think it's a grand total of 6500-ish words, 'bout a half-hour's read.

      Short stories.  I'm gonna practice those some more and get really, really good at 'em.  I've thought, I can make them progressively longer in order to graduate to a novel-length work if I like, and I can vary my approaches and methods to see which I like best for eventually tackling the novel.   I've compromised (reasonably enough, I think) on my vow to focus only on one project at a time by allowing for notes and other small-time work toward the memoir as it arises. I'll just keep a close watch on time and focus.  Also, today: I discovered  urlLink Craigslist  and used it to look for a place to hang my hat in Cali.

      Ok, back to work, ya lazy bum!  I've allowed myself a lovely long weekend after finishing Black Heron, and now I have to choose the next course of events.    (By the way, my weekend really was lovely.  urlLink Dirty Harry  wrote a great entry referring to Ice Cube's  Today Was a Good Day  on June 1, and it was a great reminder for me. I need to pay attention to and remember just regular old good stuff. Seeing Troy with my friend Mary Pat and then partying with some of her bunch for the evening was a great time a few days ago. I'm taggin' it; never will I fish to remember 'when  was  it that I saw Troy? Jeez, was it  you  I saw that with, or was it MP?' Nope, I'm paying better attention, got a colorful new filing system.  I'm a little too good at remembering and focusing on the "A.K." stuff.)  I have three options:  1) continue with some more short stories,  2) work on my first novel, or  3) tackle a memoir thing.   I have several terrific short fiction sketches.  I know my novel like I know my own reflection and am excited to take it on, in light of this recent sense of accomplishment.  But the memory thing is important, and plaguing me a little.  It's like it's asking me to do it first, like a snack-wanting kid.  Well, I'm down with that, but here's the thing: it's almost certainly not what I'd want to submit first.  I'd want what people to read first of mine (assuming I'd be blessed with their inclination) to be fiction.  I am first of all an author of fiction.  Since I'm wanting to get with the professional program and be writing imperatively toward submitting to publishers, I don't want to lose momentum (and time) by focussing on a project that's still private. So.  I shall try to find a nice tree to sit under and mull it over in earnest in the morning.  Time will be up by tomorrow evening, and one project or another will be on the table.

I love checking in on this blog, because it often has some balm to offer.

I've been anticipating BikerChef for a long time, because I know it's gonna be a great thing.  It looks like a lot of fun, unique & something truly worth firing up your TV for (which in itself makes it unique, these days :P). Anyway, looks like he's on the home stretch!

      When I was nine, I saw the Disney movie  urlLink Dumbo .  I wonder if anything has had the huge impact on my mind and the directions it's taken in this life, that film has? I had cause to wonder this again recently when the thought of Dumbo came up.   Dumbo was rejected among the circus elephants because of his freakishly huge, floppy ears. But there were a couple crows on his side (although these characters were wily and complex - nice job,  urlLink Ms. Aberson .) One of them gets the big idea to pluck out one of his feathers, tell Dumbo it's a magic feather and that if he holds it in his trunk, he'll be able to  fly .  Dumbo falls for it hook line and sinker. But... it works. So now he's the big hit, the big star, entertaining one and all by soaring around the Big Top on the very ears that got him ridiculed in the beginning.  One time, though, the feather slips out of Dumbo's trunk. It slips out when he is about as high up as he ever gets.  Horrified, he plummets.  The audience can hardly stand to watch and hardly stand not to.  But the Crow yells to Dumbo something like, "Hey, you can fly! It's not the feather, it's  you , it's your ears! Just keep flapping!" So Dumbo does. Lo and behold - he can still fly. So I thought about this.  I had been wondering what all the rules and ritual and fuss was about in my church, and about God. I thought, "I think God is the human race's Magic Feather, and if we dropped it, we'd still fly".  That thought spurred a path of thought that continues to this day. It's been modified, redirected, updated, concessions have been made, amendments have been cobbled together, floods have come in and changed its landscape. The scenery gets richer and more sublime the more I travel along it; I know better how to look, now. But it's my own spiritual path, and its catalyst was...a Disney movie. A film.  One of the points I wanted to make is this: I'm liking The Feather, lately. I'll rest along my path and consider things, and that's the latest. Native Americans, Jews and Catholics, the Celts, the Ancient Greeks, all these worshipful cultures (and of course thousands of others) have  stuff . Artful things or natural things that are Sacred. In each individual life, there are little items into which we put priceless emotional or spiritual value; looking at them or being where they are nourishes us. Sometimes we decide to ascribe spiritual value to some little thing, just for ourselves, like a little stone carving of an animal we identify with or maybe a candle or a real-life one of (or representation of) something important to us (like I have a silver pendant of a little harp that I got in Ireland; Ireland is special to me).  I've never been materialist. Not for any noble moral reason, I don't think, it's just that I'm not wired that way. But I think these days, I'm gonna pay a little more attention to  things , and the Sacredness of some sorts of things. I think it could lead to a nourishing new aspect to my spiritual life and path.

      Would you like a nice little poemie?  Well, I thought so:   The sand is cold at night so put your hand into the water let the foam lap up your fingers splay them out and touch the tide  so one hand is at my plexus and it's up and down with breathing and my shoulders down with starfish  so my mind is down with you  and the other's in the waves grasping grainy chilly seashore so you offer it to Neptune and he makes you magic lights  But I want that hand, with sand to press in firm along my forehead my throat wants ancient elements and phosphorus and salts  Heal me all together warming skin and cooling water raspy sands and gelly kelp  the heavy scent of night and moon  Heal me all together with this ancient deepest hymn and we can see up to the stars that you're the sands and I'm the sea...   Amen.

      I can't believe it's already the end of June, how the hell did that happen? Well, tonight when I get home I'll be busy getting the rest of my stuff out of my apartment. In the morning I'll be getting keys to my Capitol Hill friend's house (I long since have keys to Sandy's house, my old friend with whom I'll be staying most days out of this next month) and continuing the last of the clean-out/pare down.   urlLink 1-800-GOT-JUNK  came and got the bulky stuff, yesterday.  I made Thursday the 29th my last day of work so that Friday is clear for hanging with friends and family. Saturday July thirty-oneth, she's off! She and her very adventuresome sidekick, Puddy Tat. This is probably the longest way around to New York anyone ever took, but that's good, it's as it should be.  I've been asked about it lately (and gotten better at giving answers), and I know I said I'd talk about that a while ago, so: next post, I think I'll audioblog and mention that stuff and other plans. Do you think Puddy Tat will like the Big Cities? She lives at Aimee's right now, where there's a cute, secluded little backyard with a garden.  She'll become a completely indoor puddy, now.

      I'm yelling at myself on my other blog. It's hidden away but to my own peepers. Before I got the hang of what blogs were and could be (I had it in my head they were only big topics and only for like really smart, popular people with built-in huge followings) I kept a journal using Word. That was problematic, but I type so much faster than I write longhand that it was a pleasure to talk to myself that way.  There is, of course, a special pleasure to writing longhand and I will always do that, but this was nice, too. Anyway, I now use a blog and the advantages are great - I'll never lose it anywhere, forget to save it, wonder what sort of mood my hard drive is in, fret about getting it onto disk, or wait was it that other disk, etc. etc.  So you remember  urlLink Yogi Bear ? When I was small I loved to hear him say "Heeeeeyyy, Boo Boo!", and I loved that little nickname or name, Boo Boo.  And I liked Boo Boo Bear. So what do I call that blog? "Hey, Boo Boo". I do end up yelling at myself, a lot, so that sorta helps me keep myself friendly to me.  I love writing. I need to write like I need to breathe and walk and sip hot, high quality caffeinated beverages. I'm fairly certain I'd be no longer with us if the world ran out of coffee; likewise stuff to write with.  Or at least I'd go mad. It heals me, it helps me and it does those things even when I'm perfectly fine and happy.  (BTW, I'm mostly happy, today.)

      Ok, this is NOT written in stone yet, but I  belieeeeeve  I have a new home in LA!  It was a few moments last night when everything was just so, just perfect. I sent an email to a lovely young lady my age whose roomie is taking off at the end of this month; she happened to be online and wrote me right back. It was the sweetest letter, clearly a good person, "so happy" to hear from me! She wrote her number and I just called her that moment, and we clicked immediately.  I was excited and I might've sounded a little goofy on the phone :P, but she didn't bat an eye.  Puddy Tat is more than welcome, rent is perfect @ $500 for a br and bath in her 2br, 2 bath apt. I'm sending her a handwritten note, this morning.    Please keep your fingers crossed for me or think good thoughts my way or somethin', because I really feel great about this girl and her place and she's my very favorite one so far.   :)

      I left a little note in the comment box under the "Jeez" post, but in case you didn't see that yet, don't cry (I nearly really did cry! good grief); all the comments are safe at Haloscan, and I'm just now asking them and will ask Blogger how to get them back here where they belong.&nbsp; I'm not great at tweaking my template unless it's  very  basic and easy, so when I switched templates and then tried to turn comments back on, I evidently fucked up.&nbsp; I'll be working all this weekend, but I'll be back on task Monday.&nbsp; Btw, I'm working on a short humor piece to submit to Jest Magazine in New York.&nbsp; Have a great Weekend!

      So&nbsp;I take advice from people in the real world, cause it sounds good and it makes sense and it works for others.&nbsp; Because smart, self-respecting, perfectly good people run their lives that way.&nbsp; Well, will you please remind me never to do that again.&nbsp; I have to remember that other people have a different set of notions in their head when they talk about the 'right' way, being 'comfortable', 'successful', etc., and that I know myself and how I work better than they do, even if they vehemently believe otherwise for seemingly good&nbsp;reason.&nbsp; &nbsp; I've never planned ahead for dropping off the face of the Earth, before.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad I did this time, but you know why? Because I now know by actual trial that I had it right the first time. When I wanna go somewhere or do something, I need to just step off the damn flight deck.&nbsp; Right then.&nbsp; I always figure something out; I always either land on my feet or get to them immediately.&nbsp; I'm not afraid of jumping; never have been, never will. I listen to parents and others who wish I would go about things differently because I know they are well-intentioned, but&nbsp;I think it was a mistake for me to try abandoning my own way.&nbsp; I know a little better now why people fear change: they allow themselves time to plan for it! You get all these opportunities for things to "wrong", meaning circumstances that were not ever under your control anyway did exactly what they would do&nbsp;regardless of you.&nbsp; You have the stress of anticipation, you have disappointment (i.e. &nbsp;that I didn't learn to save any real money, & a nice high eyeroll at the fact that that's not really making any difference. How much more than enough do I need? Even if I didn't have enough, it's not like that would stop me from going, so...?).&nbsp; &nbsp; I like my Zen way. I'm going to keep doing the important things my own way, like I typically have before.&nbsp;I'm cool, I'm wired the way that I'm wired, and my way's best for me.&nbsp; Now I know for sure.&nbsp; No, my mind will never be closed to trying things differently, but I will never tell my gut to shut up and listen to real adults ever again.&nbsp;

      This weather is good training for Southern California,&nbsp;but with any luck this last week before I leave will cool off a little.&nbsp; Yuck, stickiness! I could use a little refreshing break before a relentlessly scalding L.A. August.&nbsp; We Far Northern Hemispherians area little sensitive!&nbsp; Especially if we have acquired too much insulation, as penguins are wont to do. Especially if said penguins have a fairly consistent yen for pot stickers, pieroshky, ravioli, chicken pot pie and other savories tucked in pastry (that kind of food is my  downfall;  wanna sucker me way easy? promise me savory pie).&nbsp; The good news is, heat kills my appetite like nothin' else. So I'm gonna do what I call the South Inland Empire diet.&nbsp; I've promised myself that by the time I'm set to go to NYC, sometime between a year and 18 months from right now, I'm gonna be a fit, trim, strong and dare I say  ripped  version of my former self.&nbsp; That's right, Catherine 2.0.&nbsp; Fear me.&nbsp; :P   &nbsp;

      I've been in a ratty, pissy mood. However! today's payday, and that should help.&nbsp; The deposit should go in at about midnight, and I bet I'll get a little lift.&nbsp; More good news is, I have most of this weekend off.&nbsp; I was gonna work all the way through, which would've been terrific on my final paycheck, but I think it may be just as well that I have the time.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do need to get what's left of my shit together without a looming time constraint. I need to&nbsp;spend some quality time by myself at an air conditioned &nbsp;movie theater.&nbsp; And I think after that I'm gonna take my non-virtual journal out for a drink or two, and get detangled.&nbsp; I think my mood has at least partly to do with my being pretty tangled. Some mid-scale and a few bigger-scale thoughts and circumstances have been fairly seriously tangled, lately.&nbsp; Time to sort myself and my current life all out, and get it all in front of me where I can see.&nbsp; Some it's family stuff, some of it's planning questions, painful lessons, things where I&nbsp;think I may have &nbsp;been left in the dark (or the dust), old stuff surfacing just for good measure, physical stuff, existential stuff, etc. etc..&nbsp; I need to spend a cool free day or two doing nothing but&nbsp;Tetris-ing my&nbsp;life down to just one or two layers from the bottom of the screen.

      Wow, time flies like a smartly whacked baseball, sometimes. But especially when you are trying to do the simplest damn thing on a laptop like this one.&nbsp; Along with a roof, car and dentist, an urgent priority when I get to the Southland will be a replacement (if not new) laptop.&nbsp; I can hardly wait!

      I sorted out my tangle of comments-feature problems. I'm now deciding which of a couple different solutions I'm going to use:   1) Switch back to a Haloscan-friendly template Pros: less effort  Cons: prolongs the problem and creates more work for me later if I want to change templates again and happen to once again really dig a non-Haloscan-friendly template OR limits me to always using a Haloscan-friendly template.  2) Put Blogger's in-house code back into this current template and keep it, and copy+paste all the comments so far, entry by entry, onto it (I refuse to give them up and lose that history. NFW).  I'm leaning heavily toward #2. I'm actually glad this happened now instead of way later, when the c+p job would take even longer. I get bored and want to switch templates now and then, and I don't want to be limited to only ones that accomodate an outsider feature or system.    Either way, or whether I come up with something else entirely, I'll work on it this evening and have LSHQ back on track by late tonight or tomorrow.  Happy birthday, brother James! I don't think he'll see this (maybe someday), but anyway the oldest of my little brothers turns 34 today.  Joseph turned 26 on June 21 (I don't remember mentioning him here then so, Happy belated birthday, brother Joseph! I did call and talk to him that day, though) Noah turns 31 December 17th, so I'll wave at him here then, too. Joseph and Dad are consistent internet users; I don't think James or Noah are really into it.  I'm not sure about all my sisters either except Trinity - she loves computers.  My Mom is an as-yet computer-phobe; I intend to fix that. As I get ready to leave, I'm gonna see where everybody really is in terms of computer use and give them this URL.  I hadn't exactly brought it explicitly to the attention of family, yet.  I've just said, I have a blog.  Some are like, what's a blog? Dad said, let's just stick to email, ok? :P  I think he wants to keep his illusions of me, such as they are, unmarred by evidence to the contrary (I don't think he wants to know I cuss like a sailor, for example).

      Today's my last day of work.&nbsp; Part of the shit I got together is that I got&nbsp;my laptop wrapped up, postage-paid and insured for a friend to mail to me in a little while (I am  so  not taking that thing through the airport).&nbsp; So&nbsp;as I'm getting settled I won't be online as frequently as usual, but you can bet I won't go long without at least checking e-mail and checking up on everyone's blogs.  Aimee, Mary Pat and a lot of the gang'll be having some fun tomorrow.&nbsp; I bet we'll hang at the 'Cane after lunch for awhile, then head up to my Mom's for a big batch of Teriyaki Chicken and some kick-your-ass Chocolate Martinis :D

      I had Dollmeh today at this little spot called  urlLink Sultani  on La Brea. I'm long since a fool for Middle Eastern food, but I'd never tried this before and it was Deeeelish, mmmm! and cheep cheep. Also their soup rocked, lots of warm pita bread with that. That actually would've been a great lunch by itself. But the real topper was spending some quality time with a great new pal from Germany that I met a few days ago. Being here in L.A. right now is good for the soul and feels just right. I am having a hard time getting my head together and focusing, but I'm getting there.  Dollmeh is rice, minced meat and split peas, seasoned and folded into a grape leaf wrapper.

      Thanks Shabaas and Marissa for a great day, Tues. Aug 3, '04 - Goooood Times!   I'm so massively lucky I don't know why I ever see fit to complain about anything ever in life.  I'm utterly rich in the people department. That's what counts after it all, anway, and before anything else.  Shabaas and Marissa are deeply good human beings, people you'd be a fool not to believe in from the moment you meet (or even way before, in this and some other cases).   We had coffee near their house then went to the famous Canter's Deli for eats - Yummm, btw.  I'll see you soon, M&S  :)

      I'm at a cafe in L.A. (still awaiting my laptop), so I don't have long, but I just thought I'd say, from the moment I stepped off the plane, all of a sudden everyone was  nice  to me!  I got an instant reminder of what a fucking  stick  Seattle has up its collective ass, and how sweet it is to have some relief from that.  Shopkeepers, people waiting for the shuttle with me, just strangers - everyone's handy with a dose of friendly familiarity and a warm way.  I love that.  And it's rubbing off on me and my whole frame of mind.  Yay! :)  Very happy to be here.  (btw, to all the loving, wonderful people in Seattle, no offense *humble grin* I heart you, too.)

      I'm on one of the straightaways of the rollercoaster today,  gliding along.  No news yet, I'll keep you posted.

      It's Tuesday and I drank a little more than I usually do when I drink, last night. I still have the echo of a hangover as we speak. I'm fucking heartbroken, lonely. I'm just stupid crazy lonely. I got some great, thoughtful comments from CRC on Black Heron and that was so great, but then I crashed. Hard, like how I've heard it is coming off heroin. I'm confused and shit. I'm confused about lots of things, there's no way to sort it out and I've made an executive decision: I'm going to swim to one of those free little Bahamanian Islands, build a cabin and become an alcoholic author. They have like mangos and avocados on those islands, right?  Ok Just kidding.  I had a very long, very comfortable interview today and there's great hope for a job. So there's something good to end on. Nothing in stone yet, so. Think good thoughts my way. Namaste, as the beautiful Aimee would say.

      I have been having a hard time getting my head together, but I'll consider myself excused until tomorrow morning.  I've been fairly pissed at me for not yanking myself out of vacation haze and getting my ideas and goals together, prioritized on paper,  organized and broken down.  I'm done being pissed and frustrated, though because rather than helping it just contributes to the haze and distraction.  Also, even the little good Angel on the right shoulder was like "Jeez, stupid, quit being so hard on yourself."   The outline for my life's grand design and rough schedule for the next two or three years  - believe it or not I'm now capable of thinking like that -  was all safely tucked in my brain, say like a deck of cards, until not too long before I got on the plane.  Once arrived, it started to turn into a slo-mo game of 52 Card Pick-Up.  Ok, now I get that.  This evening as the sun's going down (always my mind and soul's best and favorite time), I'm gonna take myself out for a cold brew and some good snacks in a comfortable spot, whip out the big notebook and the heavy-glidey Rotring pen, and see what's going on.  I'm gonna draw all these floating cards back in and fan them all out in front of me like a master dealer.   And when I've my shit all together and ready to rock, I'm gonna crack my knuckles and settle into the Sunday Crossword for dessert.
