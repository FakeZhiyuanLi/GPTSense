      Jan!!! Oliiin big time!! i was exhausted right, after all that jumping around in our hip hop class and that great bowl of penang laksa. Was dragged around the mall by bf afterwards who forced me to study the electric banquent pans with him. Bought one. Oliin...both of our pockets koyak liaw.Then went to hunt for knives. So boring!! he is so particular! must like this must like that. *toiiink* didn't buy a knife but he said, tomorrow must go to Warehouse and see got good knives a not! I was already running towards the opposite direction....  Oh yah, bout the oliiin part. we came home around 5 something right. and i plopped into the bed right away. When i woke up, it was almost 2 a.m. Oliinnn...my precious night time watching awesome tv shows are gone. just like that. and i'm stuck with porn ads and people promoting funny products. Anyway, that's not the  best  worst part. Guess what i saw when i woke up. A big plate of chicken noodles with broccoli! (courtesy of bf who had a happy time playing with the new electric pan ).Forget not that I didn't have my dinner earlier this evening because I was sleeping like a pig! and now, me pigging out on the noodles and its 2 a.m....the worst time to eat! booohoooo. There goes my diet ( but i was famished!) there goes my diet....Oliiin lohhhh.  * start counting/miss counting fat handles *  NB: this is even olin than the last post.

      oliinnn loh. jan, i broke the damn resolution again. i tried walking past the muffin shelves right, but ended casting furtive glances and shooting out of SuperValue with 2 muffins. i was hoping that you won't see me with my yummy loot. but then again, you don't do grocery shopping right. haiii. Texas triple chocolate and Peach and Cream cheese muffin. See, how could anyone resist?! Before you start beating me up over it, come to my house and i'll loan you a bite or two (no three.cukup). Then we start beating each other up because its real damn nice okies? okies!
