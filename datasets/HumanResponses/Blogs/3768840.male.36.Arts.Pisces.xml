         Let this be a lesson to me... just cuz I had half a semester of Japanese at a community college doesn't mean I have any idea what I'm doing when writing one of the words in my limited vocabulary in Hiragana.  Luckily, my friend Kay speaks and reads and writes Japanese fluently (English too!), and she pointed out that, grammatically speaking, "ikimashoo" is actually spelled "ikimashou". I owe her a beverage of her choice. Thankfully, I haven't started inking yet... that'll be Saturday.  Headed to Ozzfest in an hour or so. Psyched to see Black Sabbath (one of my favorite bands!), Judas Priest, Slayer and Black Label Society. Curious about Dimmu Borgir. Superjoint will probably rock. Slipknot... I dunno. Lacuna Coil... not impressed. Lamb of God... they have potential.  What is this that stands before me?  --TPB

         So here's the pencil drawing for the piece I'll be submitting to the Tokyo Monster show. The Hiragana script says "ikimashoo", which means "let's go". I drew some inspiration from the    urlLink Toho studios logo  ,    urlLink  Gigan's chest spikes   , and    urlLink  female genitalia    . What else is new?  --TPB

      Looks like I'll be submitting a drawing to the    urlLink Thunder Lizard Sushi Stomp   at    urlLink Skeleton Art Gallery   in Santa Fe, NM. Show opens on 8/13. Dunno what I'll do for it yet... I had a great idea for a drawing (Obeast vs. Slodan), but I'd never finish that one in time. I'll post a sketch when I have one.  --TPB

        I painted on Saturday for the first time in... Oh, say, 6 months or more. It felt great to realize that I can still use a brush! I worked on &#8220;Necrodont&#8221; and should finish it next session... &#8220;Mammodont&#8221; is already finished, so that only leaves &#8220;Sacrodont&#8221;, and the triptych for    urlLink The Cathedral of the Mouth   will be completed, hopefully by 10/31/04.    Also got a call from my friend    urlLink Craig   , and he asked me to submit a piece for a group show with a &#8220;monsters&#8221; theme. Don&#8217;t know much more than that yet, will keep you posted.    So here&#8217;s my idea... Why is it that when I want to get work, I have to show a portfolio... Yet when a doctor or a dentist wants to get a client, all he or she has to show is a diploma? They&#8217;ll just point smugly to the damned thing hanging on their office wall and expect you to be impressed.  I  have diplomas... Maybe my website should just be scans of my fricking diplomas and then you could just take me at my word that I&#8217;m a really good artist.    Not only that, I can create a diploma in about an hour with Adobe Illustrator. If you&#8217;d like a degree from Chicken State University, let me know and I&#8217;ll set you up for a reasonable &#8220;tuition&#8221; fee. Seriously, do you ever call the school your eye doctor went to and ask for his GPA?    Doctors, mechanics, butchers, bus drivers... They should all have portfolios. Maybe they should be like the books that tattoo artists have, with photos and testimonials. It would make me happier.    Anyway, that&#8217;s my idea.    --TPB

        I saw the new King Arthur movie last night... For free, thanks to friends at 1UP. It&#8217;s pretty entertaining... There&#8217;s one particular battle on an icy river that&#8217;s pretty remarkable. And Kiera Knightley is, um, very attractive.    My favorite thing about it, though, is its general rejection of Christianity... I won&#8217;t spoil the movie for you, but let&#8217;s just say that the Britons aren&#8217;t down with the Pope.    Been working on Iron Maiden shirts... Hope to have them finished today.    So what.    Maybe this blog thing is dumb.    --TPB

        That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m going to a Pork-Off barbecue hosted by my friend Jonathan. It&#8217;s a competitive all-day pork smoking event... I wanted to do a drawing of a masturbating pig for the invitation, but didn&#8217;t have time.    Almost through playing the Chronicles of Riddick Xbox game... It&#8217;s one of the best Xbox games out there, and definitely the best movie-based game I&#8217;ve ever played. I still haven&#8217;t seen the film, but the game makes me more motivated to do so.    Turkey, chicken, turkey... I love it all.    --TPB

        Hi!    Updating websites is tedious, man... tedious! Sure, I have big plans to redo WeirdArt.com in a more modern fashion (the last major redesign was in 1998 &#8211; I mean, Jesus Christ!), but that&#8217;s gonna take some time.    But hey... Blogging! It&#8217;s a quick way to publish text to a website. A chimp can do it, and therefore, so can I. While we&#8217;re all waiting breathlessly for my next fabulous piece of art to materialize, you can now experience my every random thought via this exciting modern medium.    Right.    Anyway, I hope that this blog will facilitate easier communication between me and, well, you. You can comment on my posts and stuff. It&#8217;ll be great.    I suppose you may be wondering what&#8217;s up with my artwork lately. It goes something like this:    For the last few years, I&#8217;ve been awfully, painfully busy with work... The kind of work that pays the bills, the kind of work that leaves you limp, exhausted and devoid of creativity. There were a few months this past year where I didn&#8217;t have a single day off. I am dedicated, yes, and maybe somewhat dumb.    ...but not that dumb! A friend of mine from the Winterland days asked me to come work for him to do design stuff for his clients... Clients like Iron Maiden, Slayer, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Mot&ouml;rhead... You get the idea. I could work less and/or get paid more... That&#8217;s a sweet combo.    So I bailed on the full-time corporate world... forever, this time. My graphic arts company, XIII, is my future now. I couldn&#8217;t be happier, more excited or more determined.    I have every expectation that my new work life will give me much more opportunity to create artwork. I still have 2 paintings in a triptych to finish, paintings about dentistry that I started almost 2 years ago. I have ideas for 2 drawings, one called &#8220;The Sugar Miser&#8221; and one called &#8220;The Shaved Wound&#8221;. And I want to pick up oil painting again... I&#8217;ve had it with gouache.    Please check back often, and I&#8217;ll promise to do my best to keep you interested.    Duty now for the future,    --TPB

        Saw it this morning and was very happy with it. I hope the DVD has an unrated cut with more fighting in it, but if you like monster movies, you&#8217;ll dig it.    Speaking of monsters, don&#8217;t forget to go to the Thunder Lizard Sushi Stomp opening tonight if you&#8217;re in Santa Fe. Details are below.    Necrodont tomorrow.    --TPB

      OK, here's a little something you probably don't know about me: I listen to  San Francisco's Classical radio station,    urlLink KDFC  , all day while I work. It's partially because I enjoy Classical music (except for fucking Bolero and Max Bruch's awful, insipid Scottish Fantasy) and partially because I don't want to bother my sweet, elderly Austrian neighbor with the subwoofer vibrations caused by, say, The Black Dahlia Murder or ADULT. I can't work with headphones, or else I'd miss lots of phone calls.  KDFC is a fine station (although I still pine for Boston's WCRB), and I like their radio personalities just fine. What I hate,   HATE  , I tell you, are their idiotic, cloying, drippy commercials. Some of the worst are for the Walk Shop in Berkeley ("...as you stroll down the Champs Elysees..."), Albertson's ( "...chicken breasts, moist and tenDERrrr, nintety NINE cents a pound in the Value Pack..." (no , wait, that's Safeway... more on them later)), or the Midsummer Mozart Festival ("...I'm Helena (imagine a supremely troublesome and unidentifiable but probably Slavic accent), the Festival director, and though I kid, and thank, the mayor..."). Apparently, the advertisers on KDFC are attempting to appeal to an audience that is a) old, b) in possession of plenty of leisure time, c) terribly status-conscious, (to a pathological degree, even) and d) fucking LOOOOADed.  The worst ads on KDFC, though, are easily the ones for    urlLink Shreve and Company  . They sell, apparently, something called a "Hearts on Fire" diamond (are you sick yet?). The chief suppostion of their marketing people is that everyone is shallow and anxious to give in to societal pressures, even at great personal financial expense (hey, that's probably true, actually). Most aggravating is that the theme of EVERY SINGLE FUCKING AD THEY'VE EVER BROADCAST is that women will pretty much pee their pants if presented with a "Hearts on Fire" diamond, and since a woman's involuntary loss of bladder control is the fondest wish of every groom-to-be, well... draw your own damned conclusion, I'm choking back bile just thinking about it.  The woman who does the weekly voiceovers for Safeway annoys me, too, but she seems to have been supplanted... hopefully she's suffocating under a great mass of those moist and tender chicken breasts.  --TPB

      It's true! My recently finished drawing    urlLink shoukaiju   will be in a group exhibition called    urlLink Thunder Lizard Sushi Stomp   at Skeleton Art Gallery in Santa Fe, NM from August 13-September 16. If you're in the area, stop by and have a look, there are a lot of great artists participating.  I'm playing way too much NWN: Hordes of the Underdark.  --TPB

        Just randomly, here are some titles that I think I&#8217;ll turn into drawings or paintings.     Is there nothing he is not?       If you cut them, do they not scream?   --or--  See How They Bleed       The Shaved Wound       The Sugar Miser       Raisin-Hearted      So there you go.    --TPB
