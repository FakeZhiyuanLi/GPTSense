      Today, all the papers I will need to fill out and have signed before I'm allowed to leave this job arrived through inter-office mail.  Wow.  That's a lot of signatures.  Coincidentally, I got an e-mail with papers for my new job the other day.  I've been assigned to TA for Hilary Hoynes!  That's cool.  Only 16 work days left and 26 days total until we leave DC.

      You would think I would know by now not to drink a big strong mocha on an empty stomach.  Bleck.  And it spilled on my dry-clean-only skirt too.  Serves me right I guess.  But today is a good day, because not only did Blake pay me for the yarn to knit that scarf, he also got me a gift certificate for Aveda!  Best payment I've ever received for knitting.  So that definitely makes up for coffee stomach.    Well, as it happens, Matthew accidentally deleted some Windows 2000 files from the registry last Thursday evening and it quit running.  So we are now an XP family.  This solves the digital camera problem.  Now I just have to get used to Windows XP because it's different than the Professional edition we use at work (which is a lot like 2000).    I snapped a picture of Shaggy, Teran, Charlie and me from Charlie's last day of work on Friday.  Buh-bye Charlie.  We'll miss you.  I'll put the picture up soon.

      A picture from our trip to Sacramento in May:  urlLink     And - finally - a picture off the new digital camera.  Alex is not impressed.  urlLink     No quick solution to the problem of using the camera with Windows 2000.  I searched on Microsoft's website for a while, trying to find some troubleshooting, but I got nada.  We even bough a dedicated card reader, thinking that might fix things, but it wouldn't recognize that either unless we were logged in as the administrator.  But the card reader is handy (way better than Minolta's crappy software) and for right now, I can just log in as the administrator, drop the pictures through a link on the desktop to my folder and log back out again.  I guess it will do.  I got my first textbook in the mail today.  I figured I should buy them now rather than later, seeing as I actually have income now and there are plenty of (relatively) cheap books available.  Them things are expensive!  The book that arrive today is Microeconomic Theory and I could use it as a boat anchor.  And I got the paperback version, on another student's recommendation!  I wouldn't want to try to lift the hardcover edition.  Now that I have the camera, I also have lots of picture of other stuff to post on my website.  My actual website, not the blog.  Okay, so it's mostly knitting stuff.  But there is also a picture of my first sewing project, of which my Dad will be very proud.  It's a silk skirt.  Boy did I pick a bitch of a first project!  That thing gave me fits, but I figured I'd better finish it before we move or it would sit in a box for another six months.  So it's done and it looks tip top.  Except on the inside.  That's a mess.  But with any luck, no one will be looking up my skirt.  I'll try to have the knitting and sewing and miscellaneous pictures up there soon.    Nighty night!

      After two years, this is my last Greenbook day at this job.  While forecasting was my favorite part of this job, it's a nice feeling to be moving on.  Only 33 more days left in this town.  Actually, 33 days is over a month, so I shouldn't say "only," but I'm getting concerned about finding a place to live in Sacramento before we leave DC.  If I think about it rationally, most of the places advertised right now are available right now or before July 1.  So that would mean that places available around August 1 won't be advertised until mid-July.  But it's a little nerve-wracking to think we won't have something lined up until a few days before we leave.  Yeesh.   I'm going to give it another go tonight with the camera.  We'll see.

      Got the camera, it's super cool, but the idiots at Minolta assumed no one would use the camera with Windows 2000 Professional.  So in order to download the pictures off the camera, you have to logon as the administrator.  Since Matthew and I never log in as the administrator, that means none of our programs or folders are easily accessible as the adminstrator.  If you open Photoshop, it acts like you've never used it before and needs to go through the whole set up process.  If you try to use the Minolta Viewer and save it to a folder, like I did, it transfers the one picture you highlighted and deletes the others off the camera before you can download them.    Bunch of crap.

      I thought I'd try out this photoblogging thing before I get the digital camera.  (Can you tell I'm excited about the digital camera?)  This is just a photo from the Cherry Blossom festival a few months back.  urlLink

      I started packing up for the move several weeks ago, but now that Matthew seems to feel like packing to, it's really underway.  We're doing a good job so far, sorting through all our stuff and ditching what we don't need.  We bought 10(!) rubbermaid storage bins yesterday at Target, big ones.  However, they are more of a liability than an asset right now, as they are blocking the front door.     The knitting lesson went fairly well on Friday evening.  Shag and Shai seemed to catch on quickly.  My photo lesson never happened though.  Just not enough time.  Maybe this evening.  One step forward and two steps back in my knitting.  That sweater that I abandoned because of the sleeve cap shaping problem?  I decided it would not lick me, and I had another go at it.  I actually got it right!  I sewed it in and it looks great.  Then I tried to sew up one side.  It seems I made the increases above the waist on the back half every 8 rows instead of every 6 rows like I did on the front half.  So the back was at least an inch, maybe two, longer than the front.  Oops.  I tried to fudge it and make up for it in the seaming, but it didn't work.  I had to rip it back to the waist so that I can re-knit it.  Oh well.  I'm still determined to triumph.    And I started another sweater from some green merino I bought six months ago.  Matthew thinks it is hilarious that I am knitting sweaters when we are moving to California.  What can I say?  I gotta.  My digital camera arrives tomorrow!

      I think we might have seen our last cool day in DC.  The forecast for the next ten days is 90 degrees with scattered thunderstorms - the usual.  The rain comes down so hard here that I can here it on the roof of the building I work in, even though I'm on the third floor of 4.    I'm between projects in knitting.  I finished the scarf I had been commissioned by a coworker to make and I need to block it and the white sweater I finished.  The book of sweater patterns I ordered is not expected to ship until tomorrow or later, so I won't be starting anything big for at least a week.  I think.  We'll see.  My digital camera also isn't supposed to arrive until the 22nd.  Bummer.   Tomorrow night is the twin's first tutorial in knitting.  Shannon and I are going to try to teach them the basics.  And Matthew is supposed to teach me the basics of printing photos this weekend in the makeshift darkroom that is our teeny second bathroom.  It's really small, so I'm wondering how both of us are going to fit in there with all the equipment.  But I'm really looking forward to it, because we'll be printing photos from a long lost roll of film from a beach trip with our buddies in 2002.  And I have another roll somewhere from 2001, when I moved in with Matthew, that needs to be developed and printed.  !!!  And the calendar says: 25 more days of actual work.  Not bad.

      I'm going back to school.  I got an e-mail from the grad secretary at Davis with a list of books I'll need, the classes I should sign up for and information on how to register.  I guess I really am going to be a student again.  Not necessarily good or bad.  To be honest, I'm looking forward to it because I have fond memories of college and I liked learning things.  But I'm trying to be realistic about my expectations.  There will be no dorm parties or tango classes or skipping lectures or voice lessons or yoga.  Graduate school is going to be a lot harder that college and I don't want to get disappointed and lose sight of my real goal, which is to use the degree to get a job that I like and also pays well.  So I'm buckling myself in for a long ride, just in case.

      A little bit closer to the move every day...  I've been feeling much better since Friday.  Still a bit of a rash, but I've washed almost everything in the house and it's subsiding.  I've also been doing dishes.... On second thought, maybe I'm not much better.  Dishes?  What's wrong with me?  My medication must be off again.    I finished the white sweater on Saturday, before Charlie's party.  It looks really good, and Matthew says it's the best looking one I've made so far.  Too bad it's too hot in DC to wear it.  It's very humid today, I've got my 'fro going.  Anyway, I just won an auction for a digital camera on eBay, so when I get it and figure out how to upload pictures to the blog, I'll put one up.  I also made a hat for Mary's new baby nephew and I should have taken a picture of it, because it was really cute.  But I suppose I could always make another.

      I've been grumpy for the last few days, which isn't very common for me.  Cynicism, maybe, hot-headedness, definitely, but not grumpiness.  I feel like my life isn't making the progress I would like it to and I'm frustrated about it, but I can't figure out a good way to fix it.  Living in the moment has never been a strong suit of mine.  I plan, that's just how I am.  But I can't plan this.    Contributing to the grumpiness (or possibly symptomatic of it) is the fact that I have had to rip out the sleeve I'm knitting about 4 times so far.  When I decided to make this sweater, I chose a yarn that was a close match for gauge, but not exact.  Though I have been mostly successful in retooling the pattern, I haven't yet gotten my head around shaping sleeve caps and the instructions for the original yarn aren't correct either, so adapting this part of the pattern has been hard.  I already have one sweater that has been abandoned because of the sleeve cap issue and I barely eeked out another (damn that Debbie Bliss).  I'm really hoping that last night's version will work when I try to sew it up today.    I also seem to have a rash.  I'm thinking it is the detergent I've been using lately.  I've always been a Surf girl, but I bought ALL last time because it was on sale.  Now I have a red, splotchy, (surprisingly non-itchy so far) rash on my torso, back and legs - the places where my clothes are fit closely.  So I suppose I will spend the National Day of Mourning re-washing every thing I own.  If the new detergent doesn't fix things, I guess I'll go see the doc, but docs are terrible at diagnosing skin rashes and I don't really want to waste the time or insurance co-payment to have someone tell me to use a cortisone cream.   I have Charlie's pool party to go to on Saturday (obviously no bikini or swimming for me now, what with the leprosy and all) so I hope that will keep the weekend from being as crappy as the last few days.

      While there are a lot of things I won't miss about this hell hole, my current peeve is the radio spot for Jerry's Subs.  There is a new one every few weeks but they are all the same: cheesy celebrity impersonations.  Why do I hate them so much?  Why can't I just tune them out?  I don't know why, but I just can't.

      So apparently this is the beginning of a four day week for me.  Georgy-porgy has given us Friday off to mound Reagan's passing.  Kind of a silly excuse I think, but I won't argue with an extra day off.    What can I say about the weekend?  It was my usual, a little shopping, a little knitting, a little packing.  (Matthew and I are moving to Sacramento, California at the end of July, for anyone who hasn't already heard.)  I went to Pentagon City to spend the gift certificate that all my work buddies got me for my birthday.  Normally, I wouldn't have let something like that go for more than a week without spending it, but as everyone had contributed, I felt I should get something that I really wanted.  So I got a great cardigan at Express and another little shirt at GAP.  I really wish Express had had the cardi in more than one color, I've been desperately looking for good basic cardigans.  Knitting was a mix of a cream colored scarf I have been commissioned to make for Blake's friend and a white sweater for myself.  I'm on the first sleeve of the sweater, which means things are getting tedious.  But I think this might me one of the first few things I've made myself that I will actually wear.  The first sweater I made, the stripy one, doesn't look so good to me now, partly because it's too big (I really should have swatched and checked my gauge) and partly because the yarn I used seems to like to shed (pill) a lot.  Ugh.  But I think I'm really going to like this white one.  I'm looking forward to getting to the level where my garments don't look hand knitted, and I think I'm almost there.      This weekend I found a speckled dove egg in the flower box on our porch.  I put bird seed out on the railing every weekend and a lot of doves visit each day (great kitty TV).  I was shocked to look out and see an egg.  I know doves aren't very smart, but I thought one would be smart enough to at least make a nest for it or lay it in a more covered area.  I also had the brief thought of putting it in Basil's cage and letting her sit on it since she wants to nest so badly, but I quickly realized that would open a whole other can of worms.  So it's sitting abandoned in the box.    Matthew agrees with me that blog is a dumb word, but he has one now, too.  I'm not sure what it's about yet, but when I figure out how to work this blog thing, I'll put up a link to it.

      Hmmm... This is going to sound stupid, considering I'm writing my first entry of my own blog, but I'm not really sure how I feel about blogs.  For one thing, I think "blog" is a dumb word.   For two things, I was just telling Matthew this morning that I think the market is pretty much saturated for blogs.  I've been reading a lot of knitting blogs lately and it's amazing to realize that someone, somewhere is making the exact same sweater as me at the exact same time while watching the exact same TV show.  Kinda spooky really.  Number three, since I hardly ever update my website, will I really ever update this thing?  And finally, the question Kristi posed a long time ago: Who am I writing this for?  And what on earth have I got to say that will mean anything to anyone else?  Last things first: I could say I'm writing it in an effort to keep in touch with people, but that's stupid, because I might as well call or e-mail them.  And unless you leave me comments, I'm not finding out what you're up to.  (Please leave me comments, seriously, I want to know what you're up to between phone calls and e-mails.)   So I'm writing it for me, in all my only-child selfishness.  When you get down to it, I probably don't have all that much to say, but I do my share of thinking.  Maybe this will be the journal that I've never gotten around to keeping.    As for number three: maybe, maybe not.  I'm not promising anything.  Two: It's true, the knitting blog market is full.  "Amy Knits", "Katie Knits", everybody knits.*  And I doubt anyone I know would want to read this thing if it were only about knitting.  There may be some knitting from time to time, but I'll try to keep it about stuff in general.  I hope Mr. Rogers was right and there are some things left that are unique about me.  Number one speaks for itself.  Blog is a dumb word.  But that's not enough of a deterrent to writing one, as you can plainly see.   Maybe I just won't tell anybody about this and it'll just be for me....   Who am I kidding?   * Needless to say, with "Sarah Knits" out of the running, I had a difficult time picking a blog address and title.  And I have this thing about putting a lot of personal information out for public viewing.  That's why I hate talking on my cell phone on the metro.  So I picked "april25th."  Personal enough without giving out my address and social security number.  Wink.

      All our time is focused on the move now.&nbsp; Except for the time I spend at work, which is focused on getting everything caught up on for my replacement, who should be here this afternoon.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I packed almost all my knitting stuff away.&nbsp; I kept three projects out for the road trip: the one-armed bandit, the purple cabled sweater, and some big thick cotton for&nbsp;squares to make a baby blanket.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Might not be many updates to the blog for the next week.&nbsp; Maybe for the next month.&nbsp; Of course, now that I write that I will probably find things to blog about everyday for the next week.&nbsp; But six days from now we'll be leaving town, so it will definitely be sporadic after that.

      Today is a shameful day...  &nbsp;  The woman who taught me to knit (for the second time) has been sentenced to 5 months in prison.&nbsp; Be strong, Martha.&nbsp; (And if you can't tell, that's totally tongue in cheek, because I think she's guilty as all get out.&nbsp; But I'd still like to cross-stitch a "Free Martha" t-shirt.)  &nbsp;  If you're wondering who taught me the first time, it was my very own mother, but I was about 4 at the time and had attention span problems, like most 4-year-olds, so it didn't really stick.&nbsp; Luckily, my mom has been able to keep&nbsp;HER insider trading under the radar.  &nbsp;   Anyhow,&nbsp;it's Friday again, and not just any Friday.&nbsp; It is my second to last Friday at work.&nbsp; I stripped my office of all its trimming in preparation for the arrival of my replacement.&nbsp; That's really the strange part about leaving a job or a place - the taking down of the stuff.&nbsp; If I just walked away from it all one day, like it was just any other day, it wouldn't feel so strange to leave, but it's all the special things you have to do before leaving that make leaving feel weird.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Probably no pictures on the blog for a while.&nbsp; The computer (at home) is still acting up a lot and it seems to crash every&nbsp;time I touch it, so I'm not touching it anymore.&nbsp; As soon as we get settled after the move, I'm buying my own laptop, so I can screw it up to my own specifications.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Oh, and in knitting&nbsp;knews (hardy har har), I finished the lace blouson.&nbsp; That's a finished object in under 2 weeks,&nbsp;folks.&nbsp; It looks good, but you wouldn't know that because of the picture problem.&nbsp; Don't have anything planned for the next project, probably because I'm pre-occupied with the move.&nbsp; But I have&nbsp;projects that need finishing up, so I'll have some things to keep&nbsp;me busy.  &nbsp;  Happy Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;

      It crashed hard this time.  Matthew had to reinstall Windows 2000 from floppy disks.  But as usual, I'm updating from the computer at work.  Heh heh.  I've started thinking of chores and errands in terms of how many times I will repeat them before we move.  I think I've visited the yarn shop for the last time.  I got my last prescription refill at the local CVS.  And I'll only make the morning commute by car 5 more times (the rest of this week, plus next Monday for a dentist appointment).  That right there is the best one I can think of!  Matthew only has four more days of work and I have nine.  We leave town two weeks from today.  Got lots of packing done this weekend.  The apartment looks really sorry right about now.  And it's hard to know what to pack next because things are in big messy piles everywhere.  But it will be over soon.

      This morning on the metro, the woman sitting next to me asked about my knitting.  It's always fun to talk with strangers about knitting.  Well, it's fun to talk with anyone about knitting really...  But she was new to knitting and very impressed by the lace I was knitting, and trying very hard not to screw up for the millionth time, I might add.  It's good she caught me at the part where I wasn't swearing up a storm anymore.     Lace pattern + decreases - row by row instructions = :-(  (The math major rears its ugly head, heh heh.) I have now learned to test the lace pattern out on scrap yarn and bigger needles BEFORE I attempt decreases on it over 97 stitches on US #3s.  It's important to understand what the lace should look like first because:  97 stitches + unknitting 7 rows of lace = big pain in the ass  But I can't fault the pattern, it's actually very well written.  For a picture of it see  urlLink the Interweave Newsletter .  (I know, I know, it's a really tiny picture.)  It's the top on the magazine cover, but I modified it so the bottom isn't blousy.  I don't want to look like I have a tummy.     In unrelated news, Matthew took me out for ice cream last night.  I just thought it was sweet.  grin.

      Why, oh why, does the shuttle perpetually smell like wet dog?  Not freshly bathed and shampooed wet dog, but filthy "I just rolled in poo" wet dog.  I want to heave every time I ride it.  I don't understand; dogs don't ride the shuttle, neither do bums, and they don't allow us to have food or drinks.  I suppose I could walk to work from the Metro instead, but by the time I got there, I would be dripping wet from the heat and humidity.  Did you know the temperature hasn't fallen below 70 degrees yet this month?  It was oppressively hot yesterday, and even walking over to the Post Office at the Department of the Interior was torture.  (I was mailing the book I had Greenspan sign to Dad.  Shhh...)  Of course, I usually get a ride with Matthew, and don't need to take public transport, but this week he's working on a big piece up at the Baltimore Museum of Art, so he's driving into work before I wake up in the morning.  So I'll just have to hold my breath on the shuttle for one more day.

      There wasn't much on the tube last night, so in flipping channels (around 7pm) Matthew came upon "Armageddon."  You know, the one about the asteroid, with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.  (Not the totally lame one with Tea Leoni, where the meteor actually does hit the Earth.)  I was baking scones, so I didn't really care what was on for the first half hour. It had already started when we flipped to it, but we decided to watch it.   Actually we watched little bits of it between the 20 minute commercial beaks.  Around 9pm, we are still. watching. this. movie.  So we finally think to look at the guide to see when it's over, because at this point, I'd like the world to end if it would stop the damn movie.  The guide says:   Armageddon  6:30pm to 10:00pm  I repeat - 6:30 to 10:00.  They turned a - maybe - 2 hour movie (and not a very good movie) into 3.5 hours worth of television.  I could recite the Nip/Tuck promo for you if you like.  I saw it about 39 times in between bits of movie.   Matthew, on the cats' nightly habit of grooming each other, then turning it into a fight:  "Wouldn't you love to go into the salon, get you hair done for 30 minutes, it feels really good, then get up and chase the stylist around the chair and beat the crap out of her?"  Hmmmm... Not really.  And maybe I should stop cutting YOUR hair.

      I had my first darkroom lesson yesterday!  It was fun.  Long, but fun.  I never realized how much work it is.  I figured you just printed the negative, washed it in a bunch of pans and it was done.  Not so.  I got the easiest lesson possible, but Matthew started talking about contrast and filters and burning and dodging and developers and tints and ....  I think I'll just stick to the basics.  Because A.) I'm not so patient and B.) I don't know a "good" print from a "bad" print anyway.  They all look pretty good to me.  We printed a contact sheet from the roll of film Matthew delevoped a couple weeks ago (developing film is the next lesson).  It has pictures from the beach trip in the spring of '02 and Margo and Kevin's wedding in the fall of '02.  I was wondering where those pictures went.  And we printed three 8X10s: one of the big group at the beach, one of Kevin and Margo and one of Matthew and me at the weeding.  The pictures were taken on the little point 'n shoot so the focus isn't great, but I'm proud nevertheless.  It all took about 2 and a half hours, during which Matthew and I were both standing in a 1.5' by 2' square.  Tight quarters.     I also bound my first book this weekend.  Matthew showed me how to do that too.  Maybe I should teach him some Econ one of these weekends.  Heh heh.  That wouldn't be any fun for either of us.  But my wee little book is just some plain paper (well, not plain it's arty paper, but it's cream colored), about a half inch thick, with a green cardstock-type cover.  Not really sure what I'll do with it yet, but we're trying to eat up all of the bookbinding paper Matthew has been towing around for years now.  One less big thing to accomodate in the move.  For his part, Matthew bound one that's probably 10" by 15" and 3" thick.    I finished knitting the "Knot a Knitted Paper Bag" this weekend.  I blocked it and sewed it up, and still have a little seaming to do to define the bottom of it.  It looks pretty cool and I'm glad I used up that yarn.  I'll post a pic when it looks decent.  Also started two more projects: the lace blouson from summer Interweave and a cabled sweater from the Jaeger pattern book that FINALLY arrived in the mail Frinday, three weeks after I ordered it.   And, last but not least, I'm about an inch from finishing the back of the blue V-neck that I've been fighting with for six months now.  It will NOT kick my butt.

      I was figuring on my next blog post being titled "Unemployed and Homeless." Has a nice ring to it, eh? But it turns out we already have a place. We arrived in Sacramento on Sunday afternoon, and after looking at a few places on Monday morning, checked out a place Matthew had seen for rent on Craig's list. It's the second floor of a two story home in downtown. The area is pretty nice for downtown and the house has a lot of character. I'll post picks sometime.  I'm actually using the computer in the lobby of the Comfort Inn we're staying in. The house should be ready tomorrow, so that means we will have only spent three nights in a hotel in Sacramento, and only four nights in a hotel total. We left DC on Monday the 26th in the afternoon, drove all night though West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois (I had to drive through Chicago at morning rush hour - I hat Chicago) and finally into Wisconsin. We stayed a couple days with Matthew's mom and her husband, then hit the road again. This time, we drove through Minnesota and across South Dakota. We stayed the night in Rapid City, just a few miles from Mt Rushmore, which we stopped at the next morning. However, we only stayed at Rushmore for about 15 minutes, because it was a warm day and the pets were in the car. Traveling with pets? Not fun. Alex wet himself that night as we were driving into Butte, Montana. Yuck. He was a spaz for the whole trip. The other too were pretty good, for the most part.  A note on South Dakota: avoid it. It's the circus sideshow state of America. It's motto is "Great Faces, Great Places," because of Mt Rushmore, but somewhere along the way, someone decided that the way SD would market itself was by having the most tourist traps per square mile of any state in the Union. Wanna see the "Corn Palace"? How about "Wall Drug," "1880 Town," "Deadwood," etc, etc, etc. Don't worry, we won't let you miss the turn-off, there's a billboard every hundred feet or so! Ugh.  So Friday we drove through Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington and into Oregon on Saturday morning. Lord, I have never been so happy to see Oregon in all my life, and I'm usually pretty happy to see it. One night with my mom, and then on to California on Sunday.  And there you have it. Long trip. We can't wait to start unloading our stuff tomorrow. And wouldn't you know it -- he have to haul it up a flight of stairs again. Damn.
