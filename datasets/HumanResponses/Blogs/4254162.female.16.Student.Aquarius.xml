       Summer is over...tonight is the first 'school night'.  The life i have now is going to be made up of physics chem econ and trig homework and the one and only P/K EVERY saturday and sunday night.  Okay, i honestly want to know who came up with the original idea of the new shoe rule.  For those of you who dont know we have to wear shoes with closed toes AND closed back aka no clogs.  Thats all i wore!  Its ridiculous that they are paying more attention to our feet then the crappy academics we already have. Last year in my math class when we had a sub come in we were teaching her how to do the problems, and this year she got a job at my school and we'll be attempting to teach me physics.  Oh well...im trying not to focus on that right now...      Last night i went out with janelle and mooney after work, we just drove around and talked for awhile which was nice.  Do you ever have friends where you love them to death but they just rub you the wrong way?  Well, I do, and we talked about it too.  I just dont think they realize what they are saying and how stuck up they sound when they talk.  Its always about them and that drives me absolutely crazy.  I think i might talk to them... i dont know we'll see.  Then janelle went to drop me and aileen off at my car (i left it at P/K) cuz she had to be home at 11 and it then came to my attention that my keys were sitting in the passenger seat of my car...my locked, all windows rolled up and sunroof closed car.  This is the 2nd time ive done that at work.  So we called adam and he came and got us to take us to mooneys car at school and went home got the spare and went back to get it. Fun, let me tell you.        Now im sitting here watching the last minutes of summer tick away...and to top it off i have to go back to work..but i gotta go pick up and get ready...later gator.

        So anyways about this whole blog thing, I told myself I would never do this, just because almost everyone does, but then again its kinda nice having something just to write your thoughts down in. My names Rachael if you didn't know, and Im on dance team, and I play soccer (the greatest sport ever invented) for my school. Speakin of that shit, I have to go back in about a week, this summer has flown by. So many memories too, not just good ones, but some bad ones too. Quite alright though, the good ones make up for the not so peachy ones. I work at hell on earth...a little place called pizza king. I work for this old Greek bitch and she makes me go insane everytime I work with her. I don't know why I still work there, money I guess. Chris, if you're reading this, sorry...haha, not really, sorry that your related to that woman. I'll tell more stories later.      Anywho, tonight I went out with Aileen which was really nice because we haven't hung out in forever maybe because she is always out of town...But we went and got some DQ first then went and saw little Christopher. His mom wouldn't let him come with us to caitlin tho. Ruby ended up being there which was nice I got to say bye because she is leaving for Iowa tomm. I watched this video cara made for her and it was depressing, because this year it kinda was weird seeing people who I have gotten to know leave for college, even I know they are coming back, just the initial good bye. It's different then my freshman year because I wasnt really friends with any of the seniors. But ivy never been good with goodbyes so either way they suck ass.       I got to hang out with Alex nate nick and Andy tonight too, its been awhile, but those guys never cease to make me almost piss my pants from laughing so hard. Love you guys..But im done for now, ill be back later....Rach
