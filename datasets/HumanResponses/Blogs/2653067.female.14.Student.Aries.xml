      Unfortunately, I have to do this project on Charlemagne's empire for socials. It's due on the 6th (next friday!) and it's a big project so I'm trying to finish it earlier so that I don't have to procrastinate.   I swear it has sucked the life out of me with it's dullness.  About 5 minutes ago, I was on msn and then Michele went on.  I said hi to start a conversation.  Shortly after, Michele got bored of talking to me and left or blocked me. I'm pretty sure she just left.  Mah.   I then left also because I really should be doing this evil project.    I'm not sure If Michele still wants to be friends with me.  I was talking to her and then she got bored of me.  Do friends get bored of eachother?  Maybe.  I'm not really sure because it never really occurred.  I don't really know what's happenening.  Perharps it's time for a break from Social studies and Social life.                                                         -Julie *To be Continued later on in another post*

      I have finally gotten around to writting in my blog.  I was so busy with homework yesterday that I didn't have the time to write something.  Hmm.. Let us think of a subject to speak about..  Ah yes, the school.   SDSS has had a fantastic renovation and it's nice that the 1500 students at SDSS are under one roof and don't have to go back and forth inbetween the North and South but things are getting insane.  The school is now over crowded because everyone is "under the same roof".  The halls are especially crowded.  In the halls, there are people standing at the sides, getting stuff from their lockers, people standing right in the middle of the halls talking about god-knows-what and people trying to get through at the same time.  I've already lost a lunch to this over crowding.  I don't mean that I threw up or anything.  This is what I mean by "lost a lunch": Last Wednesday, I bought a BLT and Cesar salad from the caf at my school.  I was walking out of the caf and then this Bastard kid nammed Michael Chang Ran into me, knocked the B out of my BLT and didn't say sorry.  He stood there for a minute, looked at the B on the floor, turned around and walked away.  Grrr.  That BLT cost me $3!!   *Forms a gun with fingers and Shoots the kid*.   But thanks to the kid and the over crowding of my school, I have lost the B of my BLT and had to eat a LT instead.     Note to readers-I got my idea to write about this from reading one of  urlLink Vanessa 's posts

      After what happened to me today after school, I have decided that I do not like doors.  Here's what happened:  When I arrived home from school, I tried to open the door.  As usual, it was locked so I made the effort of kneeling down to get the house key out of my bag.  I held on the the key tightly and inserted it into the lock.  I jiggled it around a little bit, took it out of the lock, grabbed the door handle and pushed into it.  Nothing happened.  Thinking that I had not unlocked the door properly, I tried to unlock it again.  The door remained closed.  Frustrated, I rang the doorbell constantly, I figured that Jasmine was on the other side of the door and was trying to make a joke.  After I looked in the window and saw that Jasmine wasn't there, I figured that the door is broken.  A few minutes later, I walk over to the side of the house and try the side door.  The lock was fine but the door was locked from the inside so it wasn't much help.  Several moments later, I walk to the back of the house.  The back door was locked and all the windows were aswell.  Jasmine then arrived and asked why I was outside.  I explained to her what happened with the door and told her to go to the neighboors to ask them for help or to call our mom.  Jasmine called and got the neighboor to come over and check out the door.  15 minutes passed.  The neighboor got the door unlocked and we were then able to go inside.    After having my door do this to me, I have concluded that it was probably trying to get revenge on me.

      I have so much to say about what happened today.   I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.    This morning, at around 10:00-10:30, Jasmine and I walked over to Kevan's house.  Kevan's mother then dropped us off at Cal's house at 11:00.  Immedietly, Kevan, Jasmine and I ran up to Robin's room and started to clean up the brushes and paint.  Half of the room was already painted so we started from where we left off.  By the time we finished painting the walls light blue, it was already 12:00.  We weren't finished yet.  Jasmine pointed out that there was a can of darker blue paint so we opened it up and painted the door.  The thing thats took the longest was painting each and every little individual crack.  It took atleast a good hour and a half to finish painting the cracks.  The cracks took way longer then expected because we didn't have any paint brushes.  Kevan and I experimented with diffrent "painting techniques".  When we rialised that we didn't have any paint brushes, Kevan took a roll of toilette paper, riped off a reasonable sized piece and started painting with it.  It was a good idea until the paper started to rip and leave behind little chunks on the wall.  Next, Jasmine decided to use fabric instead.  The fabric worked way better then the paper but it was hard to get a big enough piece.  Then, I went downstairs and came back upstairs with a couple of sponges.  The sponges worked the best out of all three ideas.  After painting the walls light blue and the door a darker blue, Kevan decided to do this really cool painting design but it was then ruined by Jasmine so they painted the border white.  When the border was finished, I cleaned out the room, swept the floor and we all painted the floor with the darker blue paint.  It looked really good.  By the time we finished painting, it was 2:57.  We then took a half hour break and ate this tasty "Western Family" popcorn.  At 3:30, we went upstairs and put in this nice blue rug, set up the bed frame, brought up the two mattresses, the dresser and desk, made the bed and added our final touches too the room so it would look perfect.  Kevan then wrote a note on behalf of all of us, to Robin explaining to her why we did this for her and that we spent two weeks planning this surprise.  When Robin walked into the room, we all yelled "SURPRISE!".  She screamed of joy and then started to cry.  She loved it.  Our hard work had payed off.  It took around 5 hours but the room was perfect and it was worth it.

      Hi,  urlLink Vanessa  here.  Julie is kind of busy bleeding so I get the honour of writing the  Historic 1st Post .  Yes, I feel quite honoured.    Why is Julie bleeding?  Well, the aforementioned is bleeding because curiosity got the best of her and she cut her thumb with an X-acto knife that she got a hold of.  I'd expect this sort of behaviour of a younger kid.  I can feel for her though, because the same thing happened to me.  Except I was like four, not almost fourteen years old.  When I was four, I was at my dad's store for the day.  A shoe store can be p-r-e-t-t-y boring for a four year-old.  So what do I do?  I find an X-acto knife lying around on the counter and cut my thumb with it, just to make sure it's sharp and in working order;-)  Man did it bleed!  So I can relate to how freaked out Julie is feeling at the moment.  It bled and it bled and it bled.  It bled so much that I thought I was going to bleed to death.  Hey, I was four.  Thankfully my Dad jumped in to my rescue just as I jumped in to Julie's rescue.  I guess being qualified to save lives does pay off once in a while.  I'm sure Julie will be here shortly to fill this blog up with many posts of her own. So until next time,  urlLink Vanessa   Edit: I failed to mention this earlier, usually when someone starts a blog they're like "WTF do I write for my very first blog entry?!?" and then the introduce themselves or something.  I just wanted to point out that Julie has a perfect 1st post in my eyes because it says something about her, and it's not her that's writing her  Historic 1st Post , it is I that is writing it as she is incapacitated (and because in order to publish this blog on the 'net it needs to have a 1st post.)  Once again I just thought that I'd point that out.  Now pay homage to the literary genius that I am and show me (well...my sister) some love in the form of comments.  Yes.  I have no shame.

      *Sigh*  Tomorrow is Monday, the start of another school week. I hope that this week goes by quickly.  I pretty much hung out with Kevan all weekend.  She came over on friday and I went over on saturday.   Friday- Kevan came over at 7:00.  We played donkey kong country 2 (We're almost done the game) and then we worked on the story.  After a little while, we decided to try to contact Robin at the yc.  We finally did after 30 minutes of phoning people to get the #.   When we finished our brief chat with Robin, we wrote more in the story and immitated triple yo-ers on msn.  Kevan and I played playmobil, ate a snack, played donkey kong once more and went to bed at 10:30.    Saturday- We woke up at 8:30 (so early..), ate breakfast and then  we left my house at 12:00 and walked over to Kevan's place.  I pointed out that we should do our ritual and go to mings to get gummies and chips.  After snacking on gummies, we heard  Kevans dad's Harley Davidson wheel into the driveway.  We immediately went down to greet him and his new bike.  Kevans dad then went out riding so we went into the house and snacked on our munchies while playing donkey kong.  After a while, we got tired of trying to beat the boss so we put on yo yo yo-er clothing and headed for the trampoline.  We must of played on the trampoline for quite some time because Kevans mom came home just as we were comming in.  We stayed inside for a little while and then headed back outside to play on the trampoline.   After the trampoline, we had dinner, watched this movie on tv called "Susie Q" and decided to take a nap at 10:30pm and wake up at 11 to watch something on tv.   (We set kevan's alarm clock but we were in a deep sleep and we didn't hear it ring so we didn't watch it).      Sunday- We woke up at 8:30 (again!!),ate breakfast and played donkey kong.  Kevan's dad left to go riding again so we were home alone.  We cleaned up the downstairs and ate lunch.  After lunch, we went on the computer and then kevan watched tv while cleaning up the kitchen.  Meanwhile, I was cleaning Kevans room and organizing my things.  Kevan came into her room after cleaning the kitchen.  We sat on the bed bored.  I suggested that we read over the story until my mom comes to pick me up.  After that, we printed the story out and my mom came to take me home.        Once I got home, I took a shower, cleaned my room, made my birthday wish list (MY BIRTHDAY IS IN 30 DAYS!! WOOHOO!), ate dinner, watched half an hour of the oscars and now I'm writting in the blog to give you guys something to read.    I can't wait t'ill my birthday and t'ill my birthday party which I haven't quite planned out yet.  You're invited pals so feel free to tell me what you would like to do (see a movie, go swimming, go bowling ect.).  Anywho, I'd better get going now.  Enjoy the school week and write in your blogs!  I'm going to go sweep the floor, possibly eat yogurt and do 10 minutes of homework (It's the only homework I got!).  See ya later chums!!

      I was very pleased to learn that I have received 100% in typing.  Woohoo!  Thanks to that class, I can now type rapidly without looking at the keyboard.  My next course for next term is Drama with Mr. Van Camp.  I've heard that he's nice.  Hopefully he won't be mean.  Today in science, we disected cow's eyes.  Many people refused to do it.  Others were yelling and screaming.  I just sat there at the table, looking at the eye in the pan infront of me.  I casually picked up the blade and cut the eye in half as I was told to do.  Inside the eye, there was goo and this really nice floresent blue film on "la rétine".  I took out "la lentille" and bounced it on the table (yes, it is bouncy).  After having fun with the eye, I threw it out and washed the pan.  I can't wait to disect something in grade 9!If you've ever disected something, you'll know what I mean.  Regarding "The brick".  I am pleased to announce that I have taken the brick off my back.  *Puts hand on heart and looks up at the clear sky*.  I've been waiting for that moment.  Kevan is comming over tomorrow for the first time in weeks.  Once again, Robin was suppose to join us but she is going to the yc (Please refer to last post). I guess I'll have to teach her about brace some other time.  Anywho, I'd best be going now.    Adieu.

      This was truly one of the funnest weekends yet.    Friday: Kevan, Robin and I had planned something ahead.  Robin and I were originally suppose to go to Kevan's place on Friday night but Robin's mother told her that she couldn't go for a sleepover so instead, Robin went to the Yc to hang with Bob and company.  Yes, we were dissapointed but we had fun on our own.  I went to Kevan's house at around 6:30.  Once I got there, we went to mings to go get some gummy candies and chips (This is now a ritual).  We then ate dinner and then played donkey kong country 3 on kevan's old nintendo system.    After playing nintendo and eating our candy, we headed outside to bounce on the soaked trampoline.  I borrowed big black sweatpants and a baggy black sweat shirt from kevan and started immatating a "Yo Yo Yo-er"*.  It was all very funny.  Bouncing on the trampoline got tiring so Kevan and I went inside to secretly eat our chips.  We then drifted off to sleep..  *A Yo Yo Yo-er is a rapper    Saturday: Kevan and I awoke and ate a delicious breakfast that Rodger prepared for us.  Next, we played donkey kong and then went on the computer.  I insisted that we go on msn because there was nothing else to do.  From 1:30 to 3:00, we talked to this 20 year-old guy named Brad.  He had a web cam which made the convo interesting.  I don't really know what the conversation was about but I do remember him telling us that he had a car that was much to small to be a "Shaggin Wagon". Kevan had to go to Kaitlyn's at 3:30 so she dropped me off at home. *Hours passed*  Kevan called at 6 to ask if I wanted to get together with her and Robin.   I did because they are my friends.  I spent about 2 and a half hours trying to get a hold of my mom to ask if they could come over.  The answer was no.  A little while passed.  I was home alone in a dark spooky house.  Yes, I admit I was spooked.  I was on the phone with Kevan and I told her that I was home alone and freaked out.  Kevan then came to my rescue and told me that I was aloud over!  Kevan, Jenna and Rodger were in my driveway within 15 minutes to pick me up.  After we arrived at their home, the Scotts prepared me a lovely hamburger.  Kevan explained to her dad that the two mouse-cateers were lonely and she asked if the 3rd cateer could join us.  He said yes and than the 3 mouse-cateers were reunited.  After playing poke the bunny, eating dessert and going on the trampoline, we all called it a night and hit the hay.    Kevan and Robin were on the bed and I was on the floor.  Jenna heard some odd noises in her room and decided to come sleep on the floor in Kevans room.  Everyone started to attack eachother.  Robin ended up sleeping on the floor near Jenna and I and Kevan on the bed.   Sunday (today): I opened my left eye and saw Kevan looking at the ceiling.  She then got up and left the room.  I sat up and noticed that Jenna was gone and that Robin was still sleeping.  I crept out of the room and yes, I went downstairs and played nintendo.  We were than called up for breakfast.  Robin was awake by then.  After breakfast, we played nintendo, played on the computer and than made sandwiches and bounced on the trampoline.  Robin left at 3.  Kevan and I went on the comp and talked to Brad again.  I than left a 4:15 and I am now writting in my blog.    I am freaked out because my old buddy from quebec and his friends are talking to me.  *Shivers*.  I am in a bloody convo with 4 weird french boys.  I think I'm going to leave.    See ya later Folks!    (Hey, this is a long entry!)

      Lots of things  have happened since my last entry.  I hosted Jasmine's party (it was so fun!) and then Kevan, Robin and I went to go get her new puppy yesterday.  On Friday morning, I found out that someone hacked into my Msn.  I simply changed my password.  I'm not exactly sure who it was but I have my suspicions.  Anyways, I have to go make chocolate with Jasmine.  I'll add more later on today.

      Once again, Michele is "mad" at me.  The reason this time is because I had a picture of Ben mackenzie as a msn display picture and she wanted it. I couldn't give it to her because I don't have it on my computer (I delete stuff after I load it on msn because it takes up place on the comp).  Michele got mad and than blocked me.  This "fight" we had is very childish, It's a freaking picture!  I just typed in "The Oc" in google and found it in less than 2 minutes.  Just because I didn't give it to her, she said "Your a great friend".   I want to know, who is being the friend here? Is this argument stupid? Who is right?  Leave your thoughts in the comment box.

      As the days of the week go by, I'm feeling more and more "out of it".  It's an odd feeling.  It feels as if I haven't been to a friends house or gotten together with them for ages. Kevan was going to come over on friday to help out with the party but my mom said that only Jasmines guests can come.  I was dissapointed after my mom told me that but it's not the end of the world, I might see them on saturday.  Kevan just sent me an e-mail saying that she'd be late for jasmines party because she and Robin are going to get Cody (Shorties puppy).  I kind of feel left out of that but meh.    I don't quite know how to describe how I'm feeling.  Perhaps not seeing my friends is the cause for my odd feeling. I think it's all the homework I've been doing. Could the saying  "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" be right?

      This weekend was by far the most normal weekend I have had this year.  It didn't go by quickly but it didn't seem long either.  Besides from its normal lengh, I don't have much to say about it.  On friday, I came back from school, played the sims and then ate dinner.  After dinner, I picked up the phone to call Kevan and invite her to come skating at the rec centre with me (There was a teen skate that night).  Unfortunately, Kevan couldn't come.  At that point, I felt as if my night was distroyed and I didn't feel like going anymore but I dicided to go skating anyway.  The skate was awsome because there were only about 8 people that went (most of them I'm friends with).  At about 9, they shut off the lights and turned on these weird disco lights.  It was really cool because there were these shapes of light on the ice.  On saturday, not much happened.  I did my homework made eggsalad sanwiches (they were very salty) and bought prizes and goody bag stuff for Jasmines party.  Yesterday, I didn't do much.  I helped jasmine plan out the details of her party (I helped make a scavenger hunt) and finished up my homework.    To sum it all up, this weekend was pretty dull than usual.

      Hello, I'm terribly sorry that I haven't written in my blog lately.  I've just been so busy with my socials project and homework and studying for a science exam.  *Sighs* I'm glad that stuff is now behind me.  During the past week and a half, I've been so busy with school that I've been going to bed at 11:30 (I usually go to sleep at 10).  Anyways, now that I am free, I am going to write in my blog and relax.  Next weekend Jasmine is having a birthday party.  She said that I could invite a friend over to help host it. I invited Michele but she told me shes hanging out with another friend that weekend and has a soccer game/practice going on.  I wouldn't blame her for not wanting to come because I've been boring lately (Yes I admit that doing homework is quite dull).  *Sighs*  Robin wrote in her blog that she is going snowboarding on that day.  I don't know if kevan will still be grounded that weekend or not.  I don't know what I have planned for that day.    On Monday, my uncle Ron had a massive heart attack.  It was apparently very bad and he was taken to the hospital and is now in critical condtion.  I'm not sure if he'll make it but I really hope he does.  I don't really feel like going too deep into this subject because it is very odd speaking about life and death situations.

      *sigh* There's only 4 episodes of the OC left but they're going to be intense.  This is what I saw from the "Next time on the OC" clip: Something is going to happen inbetween Julie and Caleb (a marriage?), Marissa and Ryan are going to get back together, Something will happen with Sandy and Jimmy's deal and best of all, there will be a "Tragic accident" and one of the characters of the show could be gone for ever!  Oh man, I can't wait t'ill next week.  I wonder who will be in the accident?  Ryan? Seth? Marissa? Eddie? Theresa? Summer? The list can go on.  Anywho, I'm going to get some shut eye.  See ya later!

      I'm so sorry that I've neglected writting in the old blog.  I'm been so busy with spring break and school that I didn't have much time to write in this blog.  Not much has happened since the 19th. My birthday's coming up on the 29th (5 days).  I can't wait to get my presents, my sneakers and a webcam.  Tomorrow is my last day of school this week.  We get out at 12:00 and we don't have any school on Friday. I was sort of dissapointed to learn from a friend that they wouldn't come to my school (if they had a pro d day and I didn't) because it's too far away.  I've got more news refering the nameless person but I don't really feel like discussing it in my blog.   Well I gotta go. See ya later.                                                                            -Julie  PS- Theres only 6 episodes of the oc left this season!  Noooo!!

      I tend to over react when it comes to certain situations.  This could lead to future problems later on so it must stop.  I should be flattered that I am liked and I shouldn't freak out about this.  I've noticed along the past year that I tend to be upset when someone asks me out.  This isn't really something to be upset about so why does this happen?  I don't know but I'm not going to let it bother me.

      I looked at my report card.  My immediate response was "What the fuck!?".  I looked at the piece of paper once more.  I checked to see if it was mine.  It was.  The report card showed that I had gotten 7 a's this term and 72.4% in math (a C+).  I almost passed out.  I'd never done this good before..

      Note to self: Never ask a guy what he likes about you.  It'll just end up freaking you out.  I did.  Here's what he replied, (it's copied and pasted right off the email).  I like your attidude , you ae kind, funny and your not a snob, I als othink you are physically attractive.  Uhhhg.. ain't that weird?  I seriously don't know why anyone would like ME.  I'm an ass if I do say so myself.  Oh  well.  He can like me all he wants but that doesn't mean he'll get me.  *Smirks*.

      I've never really ever Hated wednesdays.  I usually like them.  I don't have cadets and it's the middle of the school week.  However, this wednesday was odd..  I came home and found out that Robin and I are friends with the woman (Aka kevan).  It was quite a shock at first to find out that this has happened to my friend but I was okay with it.  I than checked my email and got an email from "The person who shall remain nameless" telling me that there was a rumour about us liking eachother.  I thanked him for letting me know and I returned to doing my homework and eating dinner.  After dinner and math, I took a shower and had a conversation on msn with Robin.  Just then, a window popped up saying that I had an email from "The person who shall remain nameless".  I read the letter and it turns out that he DOES like me.  *Shivers*.  I feel weirded now.  I don't know what to do, this person is older then me.  I do like him sorta but I don't know if my mother or anyone would approve of this.  God, I wish Vanessa was here so I could ask her for advice.  Why did this have to happen now? Why couldn't this have happened when Vanessa was still here?

      I've decided what I want to do.  Now I have to make the list of guests, call to make reservations and plan everything out.  I'm just hoping that everyone is alright with spending a little bit of $.  If not, they can always make up an excuse not to come.  Either way, my party will be fun.  I'm still thinking of who to invite.  I'll invite those who are nice to me within the next week.    I haven't got much to say besides that there was a drunken hobo on the bus today.  God it was creppy.  He got on near the dairy queen with a bag and cans of beer.  The bus driver got pissed off,  took the hobo's beer cans and told him he'd give them back when he will get off.  I was scared at first.  There was an intoxicated being yelling and scaring everyone away.  My fear then turned too laughter.  The hobo took out a harmonica (Vanessa's friend assumes that it was stolen from a little kid) and started signing and blowing in it like a stereotypical hobo.  I could not stop laughing.  A lesson has come out of this bus ride; Drunk people are fun to watch.

      My Room will be changed after my birthday.  Yes, thats right, changed.  Today I have recieved $20 in the mail as a very late christmas gift.  With this money, I intend on buying this awsome bed set from Ikea.  The bed set is blue, white, beige and red (It looks so good!).   My pretty pink room will be changed into a "more grown up" blue room.  Heh, I can't wait.  Jasmine  is going to buy me this "bambu" blind that goes up on the wall.  I am going to finally dispose of that old raggady cat poster and replace it with the bambu blind.   The frilly pink curtains are going to go down and will be replaced by dark blue curtains that will be about the same length as kevans (perhaps even longer?).  Last but not least, I am going to move my room around (hey, you guys can help if you want!).  One day, I hope to be able to paint my room to make it look nice.   *The title was not suppose to be gross.

      It is now the month of march.  March is the month of springbreak, spring and the month of my birthday.  I may sound like a sap but I'm already excited for my birthday and party.   I've already made a "wish list", it is now time to plan a party..  I'm not exactly sure who or how many people I'm going to invite yet because I don't know what I want to do.  This has always been a problem.  I can never decide on what I want to do.  I can invite lots of people over if I am going to have a party at my house but house parties usually suck or something bad happens (ie someone gets hurt, pissed off ect.).  If I want to go somewhere, I can't invite tons of people because going on outings for birthday parties gets expensive.  I must think of something to do..  If I were to go on an outing for my party, I could go bowling (we'd prolly go to the zone), go see a movie (only 2-3 people would be able to go to that tho..), go to a restaurant (Nah. People suck. They'd expect me to pay for them), go swimming, go lazer tagging (?) or go gocarting (?).  I doubt that I'll be able to do the last two ideas because it's expensive$.    Once I find out what I'm going to do, I'll be able to make a guest list and plan everything out.  In the mean time, I'm going to call around and find out how much everything costs.  I know for sure that Kevan and Robin will be invited.    Any suggestions?

      As you all probably know, Kevan and I (and my family too) were all suppose to go see JC tonight.  It was the highlight of my week because I was eager to show Kevan around the school and see it with her to prove that we do have a better drama program.  Unfortunately, Kevan has fallen Ill which leaves us with un extra ticket which is unpaid for.  How do I feel about this? Disappointed.  I was really looking forward to this day.  How does my mom feel about this? Pissed off.  She paid for the wasted ticket and still hasn't gotten her ten dollars back.  Why did I have a feeling that this was going to happen?

      Just Incase you didn't understand the name of my post, I'm going to see all six JC shows.  You must be thinking "Wow, She must be obsessed with that musical" or "What the hell? ISN'T ONCE ENOUGH?!".  If you're thinking that, you're partially right.  I am going to be ushering for 5 of the 6 nights the show is on.  When I heard the announcement that people were needed to usher for the musical, I couldn't say no.  Ushering isn't the greatest job but hey, now I CAN say that I was part of the musical.  The reward for being an usher is that you get to see the show.. FOR FREE!  That's an awsome deal if you ask me (the tix are $12 but I get in FREE!).  Now if this musical is as good as HAIR was, I will enjoy seeing it all six nights.

      Here's my horoscope for today..  After the solar eclipse in your sign over the weekend, you are on a new pathway to discovering something important about yourself. You are also in a great place to start something new — a new class, a new friendship or a new attitude.

      I've spent the last few days thinking about my horoscope (See the post from Friday).  I wasn't able to interpret it at first but I think I've figured it out.  I'm not quite sure what or who is coming my way but I know what the thing "that has outlived its purpose" is.  Can you guess?  If you guessed "Cadets", you are correct.  I can't wait t'ill this Tuesday.  I'm a little afraid though.... I don't really KNOW how to quite.  I don't know what to say.  This is what I have planned:  I'll go to cadets (In my normal clothes), go up to the office with my uniform and all and I'll give them back their bloody uniform.  I'll also say that I want to resign because Cadets isn't fun and is interfering with my school work (Its also boring too!).  Vanessa doesn't want to quit yet.  I don't really know why but I'll tell you one thing, I ain't going to the end of the years' "Annual inspection".  If I go, they'll all be like "WHY DID YOU QUIT?!? NOW YOU WILL PAY!!".  Yeah.. I might be over exagerating just a little bit there...   To sum this little entry up, I'm just going to say that my horoscope is correct once again.  The moral of this story: Never Join Cadets.. It Blows Ass!

      Wow, this really was a fun weekend!  I've got lots to say so listen up.   Friday:  I came home from school, Vanessa bought me a cookie urlLink   for helping her get ready for the strokes concert.  I helped around the house, did homework and that was it. Saturday: I woke up at around 9:00,made myself breakfast and did homework.  Michele came over at around 2:15 and then left at 3:30 when she found out that I had plans for later that night.  Angela and I had planed something long ago and we decided to go to her house for a sleepover.  Her and her mom came to get me at 5:00.  From there, we got slurpees from 711 and then went to her house.  We spent the night watching cheaper by the dozen, whatchin the game and playing this NHL04 game that we rented from the tsawwassen videoland.  It was around 1 am when we finally went to sleep.   Sunday: We woke up early, had a hearty breakfast and walked over to the mall.  There, I bought a sweet ass ball, bought timbits and went to shoppers for the first time (Ain't that sad??!).  Now I'm here at home, I don't have any homework tonight so I think I'll just relax.                 -Julie PS-I'm going to call you Kevan,the tradition lives on!!!

      My Horoscopes are usually always right.  I'm not too sure about this one though..  Aries:Get ready for Sunday night, when an illuminating solar eclipse in your sign lights up the sky (and your mind). Something or someone new is headed your way, but before you can take advantage of it, you have to let go of something or someone that has outlived its purpose. Know what it is?

      They say that if you quit something, you'll be branded a quitter forever.  Someone better get out the brander cause I'm quitting cadets.  Why?  Well my friends, there are many reasons.  Let's just say its not my cup of tea.  I can't wait to be free.  *sigh*.  I'm not really sure when I'm going to hand in the blue uniform but I'm hoping to quite before the end of the year.  If I quit, I won't go to camp and I'll actually be able to enjoy the summer time.  Finally, after many years, I'll be free on tuesday nights.  I can't wait.  There's just so much I can take.  I've had enough of cadets and I don't want to be in it any longer.  G'day to all.                                                -Julie

      I woke up this morning with a small stomach ache.  I feel sorta tired and a little bit sick.  I don't think I'll be doing anything today now.  I couldn't get a hold of michele so I doubt that she'll be comming over today.  On top of feeling kinda sick, I also have lots of homework to do so seeing friends this weekend is out of the question.  I hope I'll feel better tomorrow.  I kinda feel alone right now. I haven't spoken to any friends for a while.  I think I'll call them later on tonight.  A part of me feels bored but the other part of me feels tired and sick.  I have something to look forwards to though.. the webcam.  The big sale at future shop has been pushed back and will end on the 15th.  Hopefully I'll have enough money by then!  Anyways, I think I'll go and sit out in the sun and read a book, I hear the sun is good for you when you feel ill.

      I was sitting on the bus on my way home from school today.  I was just randomly looking around and then I saw a website address.  When I got home, I went to the site and I found out that it's a blog.  I don't know who it belongs to but I found a very artistic entry called  urlLink "Goat"  (Published by "RJ").  You may not like it, but I think it's pretty good.

      I felt pretty bad doing this but it had to be done.  He needs to know the truth and what I have to say.  I just can't allow this to continue any longer.  I just sent him an email saying this:  Nathan, I know you really like me but I don't like you that way.  Sorry, but I like someone else.  I don't mind being your friend but I don't want to go any further.  Sorry if any feelings were hurt.  -Julie  I can't keep my feelings inside anymore.  It was hard, yet easy to write this letter.  What's done is done.  I wipe this filth away from my hands.  Now I can finally be happy again.              -Julie LeBlanc

      Wow.  It's been a looooong time.  Im so sorry about the disgusting lack of posts.  I've just been so occupied with school and exams and tanning and relaxing and being bored that I haven't really gotten around to writting anything.  There isn't always anything to talk about.  Let's see what we have today...  So today are the elections.  I know I'm not old enough to vote but I do have two things to say:  Harper sucks.. don't vote for him.  Okay now enough of that.  Just talking about politics makes my blood boil.  Gah, I really do hate this.  All I'm going to say is that I hope Paul Martin wins the election.  Hah.  Enough of this blabber.  Today Vanessa and I went downtown.  Vanessa needed more dye and bleach (She's dying her hair blue) so we took the 601 and headed down to the store to buy some more.  I, not really having anything else to do, tagged along.  It was quite fun.  I looked for some suspicious looking people on the way home.  I think I counted about 48.  Hmm.. I have no idea what I'll be doing tonight.  I haven't really done anything with friends since wednesday.  It seems like its been so long.  I'm currently feeling a little tired (it's probably because I'm trying to read this really small print).    I've got  Absolutely Zero  plans for July 1st.  No, I'm not going to see fireworks or get plastard or do anything.  I think I'll just stay home and relax or have a sleepover at someones house (I can't have one here cause mom's working).  I am definately  NOT  looking forwards to the facking "TOUR DE DELTA" thing.  Every year, stupid people gather around ladner village, watch people race around and then they ring these facking loud cowbells.  THE COWBELLS ARE ANNOYING!  The race is  supposed  to end at 9:00 pm but it always  goes on t'ill 10:00 pm and I can't ever get to sleep or concentrate on what I'm doing.  Gah.  I hope it eventually gets canned.  Muhahha.    I'm definately looking forwards to the beginning of July because we're going to start our flooring project.  It'll be so nice :)! Hopefully it'll be all done by mid-august so I can then have a sleepover (or two).  Lol.  Im getting outta here.

      Due to my rampant boredom, I am going to write an entry.&nbsp; Jeeze, I really don't know what's been happening lately.&nbsp; I always seem to be bored and lonely now.&nbsp; What have I become?&nbsp; I remember when I used to be gone all the time.&nbsp; I don't really go anywhere&nbsp;anymore (well, compared to the past).&nbsp; I don't know why I'm feeling this way, perhaps everyone goes through a blank phase like this?&nbsp; I definitely should find something to do with myself before I become some crazy isolated kid.&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; Someone has to throw a party.. Perhaps Robin?&nbsp; Okay, now for a better subject.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to be attending a Franz Ferdinand concert this September with Kelsey and Sam and Rachael.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's going to be so much fun!&nbsp; I'm not&nbsp;100%&nbsp;&nbsp;sure that everyone can come yet.&nbsp; It seems so far off.&nbsp; Eh.&nbsp; Just thinking about September freaks me out.&nbsp; I don't want to go back to school,&nbsp; I've had enough.&nbsp; On the other hand, I&nbsp;look forward to seeing everyone and&nbsp;having&nbsp;some fun times at school.&nbsp; Maybe it won't be so bad after all.&nbsp;    Well, I guess I'll be going now.. This is getting boring.&nbsp; Gah.&nbsp; I    &nbsp; must  &nbsp;  find something to do with myself for the rest of the summer or else I'm doomed to a life of boredom.&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; Tomorrow'll be better then today.&nbsp; I think I'll call someone.&nbsp; That's enough boredom for now.&nbsp;   More to come.

      As usual, yesterday was a blast.&nbsp; Vanessa dropped me off at Sam's mansion (yes, mansion) at 4:00.&nbsp; We really left the house at 3:30 but we made a few stops.&nbsp; The first stop was at the Ice cream parlour because I had promised to purchase Vanessa a     Mango   icecream cone for being my driver.&nbsp; After the ice cream stop, we drove down 56th and then phoned Sam to ask for directions.&nbsp; We got lost due to our old expired map.&nbsp; We eventually got to Sam's household.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stay at Sam's house was quite all right.&nbsp; I drank approximately 6 and a half glasses of water, went on the computer for a long time and listened to awsome music.&nbsp; Panago Pizza and Salad was served for dinner.&nbsp; I must say, It was really good until the salad dressing and cheese started to smell really bad.&nbsp; The Wedge came at Eight.&nbsp; "Hard to explain" By  urlLink The Strokes  and "D.U.I" By  urlLink HarMarSuperstar  were some highlights of the show.&nbsp; Hard to explain was great and D.U.I was just hilarious.&nbsp; It was really ironic because me and Sam were talking about The Strokes and Hard to explain and it came on.&nbsp; Another ironic moment is when D.U.I came on because Sam was telling me that she was thinking of requesting one of HarMar's songs.&nbsp; Yep... it was really great.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really happy that I got to see that episode twice!&nbsp; It's one of my&nbsp;favorite shows and I always look forward to new episodes.&nbsp; Well, that's all for now chums.&nbsp; Bye!&nbsp;&nbsp;   And remember kids.. "Who's got the crack?"&nbsp; truly is a work of art.

      So it seems that I've lost most of my comments from the beginning.&nbsp; That is very unfortunate because they were funny comments.&nbsp; Fortunately, I still have to posts so all is marvelous.&nbsp; Now, on to a finer subject.   As you all probably already know, I went to the  urlLink Vancouver Art Gallery &nbsp;yesterday to see the  urlLink Andy Warhol  exhibit.&nbsp; It was really an&nbsp;astonishing and magnificent thing to see.&nbsp; I&nbsp;certainly do recommend that all who haven't seen it go and see it.&nbsp; Since it was Thursday, we got in by donation.&nbsp; I gave a dollar, I did feel&nbsp;&nbsp;atrocious but I was saving up the rest of my money for pizza.&nbsp; After having seen great works of art, we (Me, Rachael, Kelsey, Sam and Rachaels mom)&nbsp;sauntered down to a little pizzeria down on Smithe and Granville.&nbsp; The pizza was so&nbsp;delectable.&nbsp; A slice (which is about the size of a little bit more than a quarter of a large pizza) was only $1.&nbsp; The tax is included in the price.&nbsp; This place was a steal.&nbsp; I bought two tantalizing slices, a Jones'.&nbsp; After everyone bought them selves their dinners, we walked out of the pizzeria only to find an enormous crowd of Hoobastank fans, lined up for a Hoobastank concert.&nbsp; It was revolting.&nbsp; As we walked threw the mob ,so we could go back and sit on the steps of Robson square, we called out many "Anti-Hoobastank" things.&nbsp; It was worth it in the end.&nbsp;   On the way home, we listened to Kelsey's Velvet Underground CD.&nbsp; I must say, it was the perfect ending to the perfect day.&nbsp; I really should go down town more.

      Friday was so awsome.&nbsp; I got to hang out with some of my friends from school that I haven't seen for ages.&nbsp; Let me start from the start. &nbsp; Thurs., July 15th- It was about 10:48. I was on msn, minding my own business when Kelsey and Rachael came on msn.&nbsp; They added me to a three way convo and we were all talking about songs and the wedge and stuff.&nbsp; Then, Kelsey (or perhaps it was Rachael) suggested that we all go to the thrift store the following day.&nbsp; We organized the plan and then all went offline. &nbsp; Fri., July 16th- Kelsey came to pick me up at 1:30.&nbsp; We then went to Rachaels and watched a lot of tv.&nbsp; After a while, her mom pointed out that the thrift store closes at 3:00 so we peeled our asses off the couches and headed to the "store of thrift" (haha.. I love my spelling). Once we've finished browsing the store, I picked up a&nbsp;sweet assed&nbsp;pair of earings for 25 cents, Rachael got a little old-style makeup thing and Kelsey bought a $2 red shirt.&nbsp; Jess (Who was also with us) bought nothing.&nbsp;From there, we bought some slurpees, went home, watched some tv and then we were faced with a difficult challenge; We must choose what type of pizza's we want for dinner.&nbsp; The jury finally came to a decision: Pepperoni and Veggetarian pizzas.&nbsp; I ate some of both.&nbsp; Twas good.&nbsp; Time passed.&nbsp; Many shows were watched.&nbsp; 8:00 Came so we (Kelsey, me, Rachael .. Jess went home) watched The Wedge.&nbsp; It was awsome.&nbsp; At about 3/4 of the way threw the wedge, we called Sam and told her to come over to celebrate her returning.&nbsp; The festival truly started when Sam got there.&nbsp; At one point (after the wedge) we were all dancing in Rachaels dark kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; That was an awsome "festival", We'll have to do&nbsp;that again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay tuned

      I've invited myself over.  Well, that's not completely true; Julie  did  ask me to fix her comments as she changed her layout recently and is HTML illiterate.  Now, I've done that, but am inviting myself over to the Posting section of her blog to make  a suprise guest post  an unsolicited guest post.     Damn, it sure is hot here, and for some reason I'm listening to  Bohemian Rhapsody  (by Queen).  They've been in the musical rotation in my head since either Saturday or Sunday night.  Whenever they got played on Fox on my way home from work.    While I'm sitting here typing this, I can't help but picture "Uninvited Bill" from that debt resolution commercial.  He got a snazzy green shirt with his name on it for being uninvited to that lady in the commercial's house; I think I should get a green t-shirt for writing this.    Anyways, that's all I have to say for now.  I think I'm going to get out of here before I overstay my welcome, or unwelcome, whatever the case may be as I don't really know because I was uninvited.  Alanis Morrisette has a song by that title.  If you're feeling girl power, you should check that out.  Or leave comments because I fixed them.  That's right.  Comments.  Now.

      Okay. So I was getting pretty damned bored with the plain old "Blue and white" template so I decided to get the new "polka dot" one.  heh.  It's pretty good if you ask me.  Im now amongst many other people that have the exact same template.  Feh. I don't really care because my blog is different then the others cause it's mine.  Wow, that was corny.   urlLink My other blog  is my work of art. I costom made it myself... its one of a kind.  I can't say that I don't like this layout, I just don't feel that it's "special" because everyone else probly has it too.  Feh.. enough with this.    Turns out that Don* really likes Kelly*.  Apperently, he's really concerned about her life and her safety.  This took me by suprise. I guess my first impression of Don wasn't so great (I saw him when he was drunk).  Lol.  I do hope things all work out fine.  Now my other friend, Karen* is having some other problem of her own.  It is believed that a guy named Calvin* likes her but she's having "mixed" feelings about him.  Heh.. I'm having the same sorta problem but it's not about Calvin or anything. *laughs*.  This sucks. Meep.   *=Names have been changed.  Now for a better subject.  Robin is comming back from the ranch tomorrow.  Yay.. I can't wait t'ill she gets back!! She'll probably have lots to tell.  Unfortunately (but fortunately for Kevan), Kevan is going to a ranch tomorrow.  She'll be gone for 3 days but she'll have fun.  Lol.  Geez.. just when Robin gets back, Kevan leaves! We'll all be reunited again soon. *Smiles*  Well, I'd better get going cause I want to read some more of "noughts & Crosses" (A really interesting book about what the world would be like if "whites" were the slaves of "coloureds").  I'm not really into the book yet but I soon will be... I hope.  lol. I'm going to go now.                        "PeaceTheFuckOut"                 -(Just)Julie  Latest news- The flooring project is really comming along.  The downstairs bathroom is almost fully tiled now.  Tomorrow, we'll finish "tile-ing" the bathroom and then start putting down some nice laminate everywhere downstairs (except in the livingroom and laundryroom). Something to look forwards to- On the 27th of July,or around that date, I might (probably) go to with Robin to a rodio (I think her granpa owns it or something). It should be fun.

       So I went to the mall today with Sam and Kelsey.  Kelsey came to my door to get me and we walked over to her dad's white car that was waiting for us in the driveway.  In the car sat Sam, Wade and Mr. Croft.  After a long car ride, we got dropped off on the side of a curb on a street near the London drugs in richmond.  We spent some time looking through the cd's and dvd's at the London drugs store and then we walked to the mall.   The trip to the mall was quite pleasent at first.  We looked through a couple of stores and went to the chinese bakery.  Then the worst happened.  Mr. Glass, who was sitting in a strange position on a near by bench, spotted us!  It was very unexpected and I was horrified.  Sam and I peaked around the wall of the bakery as Kelsey paid for some rolls.  Mr. Glass's eyes were focused on Sam and I.  Finally, after what seemed like forever, Kelsey finished paying and we walked out of Mr. Glass's sight.  After the awful moment, we browsed through a few stores, and walked over to the food court.  A small, chocolate,  Dairy Queen Milkshake was bought (and eaten) by Sam.  The last stop was HMV.  We spent a good forty five minutes there.  In the end, Sam bought a  Guided By Voices  Cd, Kelsey bought Two Dvd's and Cd's that were $101 in total and I bought  The Velvet Underground & Nico  (see the image above).   It turned out to be a great shopping trip.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough money to buy something that I wanted so I'll have to return to the mall soon.  Hopefully I won't encounter Glass ever again.

      Once again, I'm caught in another one of these love triangles. I really loathe these infernal situations. Let us go over the situation very briefly. 1-Kevan likes boy.> 2-Boy likes Julie.> 3- Julie is mad because she doesn't like these situations. You know what? Something has to be done. I'm going to end whatever the hell's going on here because I really despise this sorta stuff. Gggaaaarrrrg! New subject please!  Coincidently, I've been having conversations on msn with the one I despised so much from the last situation (such as the one aforementioned) in late may. Yeah okay.. I don't feel like talking about these "triangular love situations" because quite frankly, I don't care for love anymore. I've been in too many stupid situations.  So today I might go to the mall with Sam and Rachael. Rachael wants to get a blazer and I've got no idea what Sam wants. I will be purchasing a poster. I fear that I will never be able to hang it up on my wall due to certain reasons (It's not porn or anything).  Well I'm going to go and eat some breakfast. Bye!  Oh yeah= -I think some Kevan-Robin-Julie time will be necessary. -I hate love. -I think Vanessa knows about my "Secret purchase" (lol). ~ A-Very-Perplexed-Julie  And to "Anon.", Thanks for the advice. Yes, I will take it because it's the right thing to do and because the same thing happened to me where I was in Kevan's shoes.
