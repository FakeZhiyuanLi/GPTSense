      Are they too confused to be any fun?  What if I just want to play with one for a while?  What if I just want to run my hands over a tightly wound, hard body?  What if I want a soldier to submit to me?  Am I so wrong?

      Was in BestBuy on Friday looking at the fun new toys.  There has this absolute gorgeous hottie buying a phone or something.  About 5'11", close cropped, dark hair and goatee with that super-thin line of beard along the (oh so cut) jaw=line pulling it all together.  Probably mid-to-late 20's, excellent build without being too bulky, broad shoulders, thin waist.  Wifebeater T and old blue-jeans.  The jeans were loose on his hips without being too low (unlike all the silly kids do these days)... they were just kinda pulled on.  And that wifebeater was TIGHT on him.  I wanted to lick him.  Would've liked to snap a pic to share on here.  Next time will do so if I can.  Since when are all the hot guys hanging out a computer stores?  More and more that seems to be the case.  Anyway, for the guy at Best Buy on Friday - show it off!  And pardon me if I accidentally lick you.

      On a day like most others, I've decided to make a weblog.  I think it's some need to have an outlet that isn't wholly private.  We all want to be known, don't we?  And blogging seem like a fine way for me to vent and to potentially share it with people in some form or fashion.  I think that the push for me is related to some sort of early mid-life crisis.  I'm in my 30's, educated, working and contributing to society, involved in my church.  I have a good group of friend, acquaintances and a family that loves me and whom I love in return.  However, I'm not happy these days.  I'm having some huge issues with my life and I'm wanting a change, and I don't know what it should look like.  In general I'm dealing with a job that I have grown very tired of.  I am struggling with my sexuality... or with my homosexuality, to be exact.  I am wrestling God on a daily basis trying to find some kind of life-equilibrium.  I have no creative outlet that I find to be suitable for my life at the moment.... and so I've taken to wallowing, and wasting my time.  I want it all to change, and I want it to change soon.  So, I am going to use this as a kind of journal.  To vent, to think about things, to keep a record, and perhaps to draw a line in the sand.  Time to move.  Time to break up the flow of dreary days and to begin making something new.  Today is the day.  My name in this endeavor is Baltasar Rune.  Loosely translated German, it means Protected by God & Secret.  I think it perfectly captures the teeter totter feel to my life these days.  So here we are... and here we go.
