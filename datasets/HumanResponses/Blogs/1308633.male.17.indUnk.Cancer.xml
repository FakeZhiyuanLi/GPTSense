      It looks like this post will be the second for the day, just because i made the first one after midnight last night..... yeah today, i went to bible school again, where i discovered that an alarming number of young children have purple shirts.... dad showed up and my mom, grandma, and i proceeded to lunch......then, i went to dad's office, and did some stuff for him, like, packing models to ship off to utah, and cleaning rooms, super exciting stuff; oh, and my dad got mad at his new x-ray machine so he took a part off of it and was happy........ later, came home and managed to fall asleep on three different couches; that was pretty cool...... then it rained..... a lot..... then some other stuff happened, and is in the process of happening....... yay

      What a day...... sorta so, i went to bible school to help my mom with the crazy three-year-olds.... awww, little abby is so cute, lovingly biting my hand....... then went with mom and grandma to "the store" for lunch...... then came home to find a snake in our garage, the details are kinda boring, but it got away..... freaky stuff, there.......... then i read harry potter until it was time to go to dr. pratt's office; i got a bitch of a retainer, and it looks like i'm getting my wisdom teeth out pretty damn soon.... boo...... then came back home, read harry potter, ate dinner, and then, finally, FINISHED harry potter numba five, just a matter of minutes ago; the novel makes the real world look very dull; i can't believe it took me five days to finish it, i think it took me two days read number 4, but hey, i've been busy...... so now i can have a harry potter free day tomorrow.... hmmm..... ok....... that's all for today.....

      wow, i missed a day for the first time since i started this blog; please forgive me  yesterday, i went to church, then went to my grandma's for lunch, to which we invited my great-uncle (one cool cat) to eat with us..... then i helped my mom set up for bible school, but before that we tried (to no avail) to move a huge table out of the room she wanted, after struggling for several minutes; dialog:           Mom: "At least no one's here to see us"           Me: "God is here; and he's definately laughing at us" then came home and read harry potter  today, i went to Cooks Point United Methodist Church's Vacation Bible School. i hate getting up at 7...... and then i hate driving all the way out there...... my mom's class had 4 kiddos, which i helped control, i guess it went okay; it was just in the morning, and nothing can be extraordinarily fun on a summer's morning; after that mess was over, we took grandmother to the cooks point store (a fine dining establishment), an hour later we were on our way home, where this afternoon i read harry potter and some driver's ed shit (horse shit), humm.... then we had something for dinner here... oh yeah, spaghetti (ooooh, i spelled it right on the first try). so anyways, i hope that everyone has a great week, because i know that i will with hannah, levi, abby, and trevor.........

      today was pleasantly boring. i finished the fourth harry potter book, then immediately started the new fifth one, which i discreetly bought this morning at kroger. i read an article about how people waited in endless lines to get the book, when i only waited behind one person at the checkout, hell, i even had a little conveyor belt to put the book on...... so that was most of my day; reading i kinda skipped supper because my parents went to a gospel concert at wolf pen, so i had some chips and a slice of pizza a few minutes ago..... that was pretty good well, that's enough

      I finally get a somewhat relaxing day...somewhat............ i woke up at, like, 11:30, which was very nice, then had a sandwich for lunch, i guess i read harry potter most of the afternoon.... the fourth book, just to kinda refresh what the hell is going on in that series so i can buy the fifth book sometime tomorrow, or so........ later dad came home and we tried to make my car smell better because it smelled like perfume shit when we got it..... we sprayed some clorox stuff into the intake for the air conditioner and dad cut his finger on the fan... haha. then we drove around in it some, yeah...... then i mowed the backyard, it was rather warm this afternoon..   i'm tired of typing, the rest of the day was boring .......... end

      what's today? wednesday? yeah.......... okay, so: i woke up at like, maybe 10 when my mom said she was leaving to go to lunch with her teacher friends, and then proceeding (without returning home, she reminded me) to a workshop concerning "bell work," which are those little crap activities some teachers have us do right after the bell rings..... i let my mom hear my opinion of those things, and she agreed that they're pretty much worthless........ but back to me.... because i'm just so terribly self-centered i made a sandwich (turkey with monterrey jack on wheat buttermilk) for lunch; good stuff....... then i'm not really sure what i did this afternoon, i was on the computer some, and i watched tv some.... oh and i started to re-read the fourth harry potter book so i'll be all prepared and refreshed for when the fifth one comes out on saturday....... i'm not sure if i'll go to a bookstore saturday, they'd be kinda crazy.... whatever, that's too far off to think about then my parents came home and we went to mi cocina..... my dad had a bad margarita, not that that's important or blog-worthy, but oh well........ so then i came home and we made reservations for our vacation in new mexico at the end of july; gosh, that's gonna be sooooooo much fun...... boo...........  so now i have the evening to waste away...... i could play nfl fever, i need to win another super bowl, even though i don't think i get any rewards or anything well, that's enough for now........

      today......... i woke up and my dad was there because he didn't go to work today because it's saturday.... funny how that works -after sitting around for a while, i took a shower -ok, so then i went to double dave's..... saw kan yan and his brother and father -then..... i guess that's when i cleaned my room, which took a few hours because i'm such a perfectionist when i clean/organize things, and also because i get side tracked reading stuff or something, so now it's all pretty and less dusty...... i didn't realize how much shit i had piled up on my desk, that took the longest, so now i can enjoy my gleaming room for a couple days until i get kicked out... we're having some lady in from el paso, so for some reason i get the real guest room.... crazy -then i went to my grandma's with my dad, and we had some chocolate pie that we bought from kroger, where apparently a kid had been left in a car..... there was a fire truck and ambulance there, and then a police car almost ran into me when i was leaving.... -driving toward towering thunderclouds in the dark, while listening to old country music is a very, very odd sensation -then went to the new church's chicken place by wal-mart..... that was pretty good, and so now i'm here writing this blog and listening to NEW YORK, NEW YORK by FRANK SINATRA.............. woooooooooo hoooooooooooooooooooooooooo          bye

Butt's grocery store, and it really started to pour, that was fun driving in that rain, with the streets covered with water... -then we grilled some chicken, and some other stuff, that was good -i've been watching the television since then.... overall 'twas an okay day  shit

      My day up until about 9:00 was total crap, so I won't talk about it since I'm trying to get out of the awful mood that it caused.  My day got better this evening when I went to Wal-Mart. I bought nametags, chalk, and cups for tomorrow (shudder). I think I was in the store for about an hour. It took forever to find the things. The cups were in the seasonal section by the garden department, and the chalk was on one of the hundreds of toy aisles, crammed with junk. I saw a Japanese man punching this Hulk toy that growled or something when you hit it. And this wasn't like a young guy being silly, this was a forty-something Japanese man... and we all know how funny they are... Then I waited at least 5 mins. in a checkout line behind a lady who bought 30 or so articles of clothing. Then I changed to another lane, and checked out in less than a minute. After that I went to Whataburger and got supper for my ailing stomach. But now, I think I'm in a better mood. Tomorrow had better be a little fun, or else, or else... I'll make it fun *gasp* Blasphemy!

      Today was crap, total crap. Most of the day, I was at my mom's school, helping her set up her classroom. With twenty plus years of kindergarten teaching, she has accumulated A LOT of crap. All of which has to be placed in precisely the right location in her room. But, I guess that was okay. There is scandal in the kindergarten building, but it's unethical to put in this blog..... I guess. We got done at College Hills at about 6, and then I came home and took some medicine for my stomach, which felt like shit, then walked over to the big/little thingamajig. It was very uneventful. Rob and I did shit. After I got home, I had two cans of Dr. Pepper for supper; yay me! I'll prolly be up for a while tonight. Captain/Drum Major thing tomorrow. That will suck with a capital suck....... haha........

      I'm back from New Mexico. While on that trip, I had a lot of time to think about things. Here (in the form of a poor essay outline) is what I came up with:  I. Introduction paragraph: a. Attention-getter: SEX!!!!!!!!! b. Fluff c. Thesis: Somewhere, something is happening, and I know nothing about it.  II. Body paragraph 1: Topic: New Mexico highways are inferior to Texas highways Evidence: The speed limits are insanely low. In a construction zone on a major road, the speed limit went to 25, in Texas this would be 55, if that low. Also, it was rare to find a 70 mph area on the open road; in Texas everything is 70, and in west Texas it's 75. TAKE THAT NEW MEXICO!!! And NM has some stupid rule where there are signs indicating if you can pass or not... I believe that is what the stripes are for... And the mountain roads are all narrow and curvy. Just blow up the mountains and make land to grow soy beans on.   III. Body paragraph 2: Topic: There are a lot of oil wells in West Texas.  IV: Body paragraph 3: um....... how bout I just forget this "outline" thing and just type normally, because I forgot the other funny things that I was going to put here...  But now, I don't know what to type about. We did some stuff and drove a lot (1800 miles). Mom read Harry Potter most of the time....um... the rest wasn't really blog-worthy. We did many interesting things though.   yeah....  Tomorrow, is the big-little thing, and then the next day is the captain thing, and then the next day is the summer band thing.  BLAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      So I thought to myself... I should make a blog entry, and so... here goes: I got up at like, 8:30 (early), and mowed the front yard. About ten minutes after I was done, a lot of water started falling from the sky. This water cancelled my lunch date with my dear, sweet Granny. So instead I went to Arby's. Then, in the afternoon, lots of little things happened. One of mother's teacher friends brought a friend over to see how our house was decorated. I went to the post office. I later went out to grandmother's and helped her figure out her pill crusher, and also fixed her TV (by changing the channel, and hitting the Wireless One box). Then, I came back home. Not much later, my dad came home and proclaimed "I forgot the damn gold." I went to FedEx for him to send teeth to Utah, while he went to get said "damn gold" so that he could cast a crown for a dental student. This was an interesting process. He melted the gold with a blowtorch to a temperature of like, 1000+ degrees. Then set the mold next to it, and let the gizmo spin the molten gold into the mold (rhyme!). Then they left and we went to eat at Fazoli's. Then I went to my dad's office and Wal-Mart.  Tomorrow, I am leaving for New Mexico. I'll be back Tuesday some time. I really have no idea what we're doing out there; we're just... going. I think we're going to see horse races, though. It should be fun anyways. I hope you readers don't miss me too much.

      I didn't do much today. My mom was meeting with kindergarten teachers the whole day, while I slept and played videogames. What a life! This evening we ate at the new Fuddruckers, which is a lot like the old one, except the new one has more crap on the walls. Nothing funny happened today either. Bye.

      Hmmm....................... Today, I went to The Theatre Company's production of  Annie Get your Gun , not long after I woke up. It was very good. Then, my family and I went to the new Wings on University. It was okay, but I wasn't hungry enough to eat the several metric tonnes of french fries buried beneath my fried chicken. Then, we returned home, and I immediately left with my dad to do crap at his office. Crap like, washing the windows out front. And somehow, my dad managed to get the water to a temperature probably mere degrees below boiling, however, he failed to mention this to me, and I almost kicked the water all over the place when I stuck my hand in. It was like a plate at a Mexican food place; you have to wonder why it's so damn hot. Then I came home and watched  Analyze This  on CBS. Now I'm on the computer as I am every night... What a day!

      Well, as it turns out I did go to the concert thing. The band was called "Big Otis." Big Otis is a big black man; he was very cool; he sang old songs and stuff. The black audience danced, while the lesser-priveleged white people expressed their enjoyment of the music in other manners. At one point in the evening, Big Otis called a fifty- or sixty-something lady up to the stage, who, quite possibly, out-funked Big Otis with her dance groove; everybody enjoyed a good laugh at that one. About 3,000 people were in attendance this evening, pretty cool. Props to the College Station Utility Department for putting this series on. Have a good evening everyone.

      What DID I do today?? hmmm.... oh, okay My mother got me up around noon, and sent me to pick up some lunch. After we ate, I took my dad's sandwich to him at his office, where he was showing one of the oral surgeon's sons how to cast a crown (fun). Then, (after arguing with my mother) I helped clean house. This evening, they went to a wedding, in which both the bride and groom have Down syndrome. You may have seen the bride (Wendy) working at Chick-fil-a. While they are at that, I stayed at home and did nothing (read: wrote blog entry). Actually, I did make myself supper, which consisted of: wheat crackers, cheese, peanut butter, and sour cream and onion potato chips. At one point, I put all four together and dipped it in some ranch dressing I found. To answer the obvious question, it tasted like a wheat cracker, cheese, peanut butter, and sour cream and onion potato chips dipped in ranch. Later this evening there is a free concert at Wolf Pen Amphitheater, which I might or might not go to. Some people will be there that I know, and my parents might go if they get back in time. Well, that's not until later so I won't worry about it.

      Today was an odd day, actually. I woke up around 9:30, and my mom was trying to get me to mow the yard, but I didn't want to. However, I lost that argument as I lose all arguments that happen while I am still in bed. So, I mowed the front, and my mom came out with a trash bag and picked through the flowerbeds, and a bag later it looked no different from the street than it had before. Then I had lunch and mowed the back, almost running over a snake that I hadn't seen for about a month.... boooo.. Then, I guess I worked on the computer, trying, to no avail, to make the video capture card work. Oh well, at least I got the CD burning software working, so I don't have to use stupid Windows Media Player. This evening, a friend of my family came over and showed us that she was getting married, and at the same time, my cousin came over with her husband and their dog, to let Sadie get aquainted with her. So, at one point, there were six people and two dogs in our living room. That was fun, though. Later, my dad came back from a meeting in San Antonio. So this evening, I've done nothing. Now, I'm listening to a newly burned CD of a motley selection of music. My day was actually more exciting and humorous than how I wrote about it, but I don't feel like putting a humorous flair into today's blog. Although........ when I went to pick up a prescription, the pharmacist asked how my summer was; I said fine, and she asked if I'd been to any nude beaches in the Riviera, and I said no, and she said, "Well, then it can't be going that good." Funny lady....

      Woah, yesterday's entry was harsh... sorry bout that Today was pretty boring, except for going to lunch with my grandmother. She was very, very excited to have me taking her to lunch. We also went to my grandfather's grave and changed the flowers, and went by one of my grandma's friends to pay her back some money. I also cut a watermelon for her (and threw the rind over the fence, very fun), and helped her with her pill crusher. As I said, she was very excited. Then I've been at home the rest of the day, doing nothing. I watched  Jaws  all the way through for the first time, although I think I've seen the entire movie, broken up. That is a very funny movie. I sent an e-mail to myself from my cell phone; it said "Hello." That probably cost, like, 30 cents, stupid Cingular. STUPID HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS! Trying to kill me. I'm sure of it. Have a lovely day, everyone!

      oh. yeah. today is my birthday. yay!  I woke up and showered, then went to the driver's license and got my license (yay), then I stopped by the insurance place and my mom added me to our insurance (bill), and now we get to pay like twice as much as we are now. Then, after watching the weather channel dramatize Hurricane Claudette for a couple hours, my mom and I went to Sam's, then the garage door place to get another garage door opener for my car. Later, my parents gave me a big birthday cookie, some car stuff, and a cell phone, then we went to Outback. This evening, I watched some of the All-Star Game, and read through the senior wills. For some reason, they were quite depressing, not because the seniors are leaving, but because the class of '03 seemed much less convivial than the class of '02, and because they all seemed slightly angry or something. Or maybe because it's fake, or something. Or maybe because no one wrote anything to me. hahaha.... But recently, I've been feeling like I don't like band, but I'm sure I'll feel better about it when summer band rolls around......... wow........ that's two weeks, and two days from now........ shit........... hmm.... oh well! tomorrow, I'm taking my grandmother to lunch... that'll be fun...... wow, I can drive, now!

      Bastille Day! Yay France! Day before my birthday! Yay birthday! I started off the day getting a physical examination by my doctor. The nurse claims that I have 20/15 vision in both eyes. Yay eyes! Then I took Mother to the Farm Patch. For lunch, I made a sandwich. I spent most of the afternoon doing nothing. Then my mom actually cooked supper; 'twas good. I went to my dad's office this evening and then to Kroger for some ice cream. When I returned home, one of my mom's co-workers was here, and I was quickly bombarded by them both on how they wanted me to make some spreadsheet thing for them. Now, I am here, watching the Eiffel Tower wave at me.......... I think I could look at that all night.  Yay day!

      Wow. The third post for Sunday... groovy..... So I woke up this morning, I mean afternoon around 1 or 2, and had a donut for breakfast, then went to HEB for some stuff. Then around 4, I had a pepperoni roll for lunch. Later, we went out to grandma's for supper. In other words, absolutely nothing happened today. Oh, but I did write thank you notes to my relatives who have given me birthday presents. It's not even my birthday, and I've already written back to 6 people, wow, I'm on the ball!  okay, bye!

Thanks Gilbert! (I guess you occasionally read this, and I really have no other way of communicating with you).   wow, this is my second post for Sunday, and, like, Sunday hasn't really "happened" yet........ well, I hope you readers can understand...... hahaha

      I had a busy day, but it didn't really seem all that busy..... my newlywed cousin and her husband came over to give me my birthday presents from that side of the family, and my mom invited them to stay for lunch. They accepted. Slava (my cousin-in-law, i guess) drove to DoubleDaves, and I got the pizza, while he went to JJ's and bought beer. Later, Jason came over, and hung out most of the evening. That'll be the last time I'll see him for a long time......... sad........  Well, now I'm watching  I'm with Busey . funny

      hi, I just got back from a 5-day vacation in the super cool city of Ft. Worth, Texas. I went  urlLink here  and   urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  Additionally, I attended a meeting of retired federal employees; that was a lot of fun. It was essentially a meeting for some old people to catch up with each other's lives over the past month and get a good meal. A lady talked about how her hearing aid got run over at the last meeting, and another complained jokingly that they couldn't afford to send a ragweed to the people in their organization who died. At the age of 60, I believe my aunt was the youngest member of this fine organization, which meets at a conference room at Weatherford College. Very amusing. I also put up with my bratty cousin, Austin, who claims to be six-quarters because he doesn't understand fractions...... I went to a baseball game, and hung out with my now 31-year-old cousin, Mark, and his wife, who is pregnant with a boy. But I think the highlight of the trip was our visit to the Petroleum Club. After a fancy dinner there, my cousin and I both received rather large birthday cakes with bright sparklers shooting flames/sparks at least a foot into the air. They boxed up the cakes, since dinner included a dessert, and when we got home we found that the cake had been boxed with a Petroleum Club china plate underneath it. I guess they'll be short two plates when they do inventory. Also went to the Central Market in Ft. Worth. It wasn't all that impressive. weeeeeeeeeee........... I think I'll go to TCU, just so I can live in Ft. Worth, yeah....... yeah........ that'd be great.......  oh, and while I was on my aunt's computer, I looked at my blog in Netscape, and it looked awful...... so if you have Netscape, you can just go fly a kite, or something  or something

      Hello everyone. I'm in Ft. Worth having a grand old time. I'm on my aunt's laptop, which sucks for typing, so I'll just make a big post later on my cool keyboard back at home. Well, just wanted to let the masses know that I'm still alive, and will be back Friday evening. Adios, amigos!

      The fourth is no longer my favorite holiday. For the second year in a row, I got sick. Both years it started right after lunch, and ended by that evening, but it still ruined our plans. no fun.... Nothing is going to happen today, so I won't make another post until, maybe Friday, unless I get to some internet up in Ft. Worth next week. See you later.

      hello friends and neighbors. nothing happened today until whenever we left for a 4th of July party. we left the house, and everyone was in a horrible mood. then we got to the pasture where the party was, and people were fishing in the tank and sitting around and stuff. some guy caught a 6 pound catfish, that was pretty cool. then we ate 4th of July type food. then the little kids shot fireworks. later, some guys arrived from delivering a stillborn calf, and they recounted their story to everyone........hmmm.  so now i'm sitting here, we have another 4th party tomorrow, along with bigger fire works....... yay

      Today blowed. Actually, I think the lady on the Midday Magazine television program said that the winds today were "light and variable," meaning today blowed gently........hahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa         ha But seriously, nothing happened, until maybe, like, 6:00, or so at that time, all of the mammals in the house piled into the little car and went over the river and through some trees to grandmother's house we went. there, we visited with my aunt, and discussed when i will be visiting her and her clan in Ft. Worth (July 5-10). then sadie and i walked through the pasture. then we came home, where i have been speeding the rotting of my brain by sitting fruitlessly in front of the computer.  au revoir

Right now I'm watching the Henman-Grosjean match on ESPN; Henman is losing; that sucks. Tennis is fun to watch. okay............ bye

      I guess I'll pick up where I left off...... on Saturday....  Sunday, I drove to Orange, TX and we hung out at the hospital there, with my grandparents. My grandmother isn't recovering well from a triple hernia surgery, and has been in the rehab part of the hospital for almost three weeks. Monday, we went to the hospital, went out to eat at some cajun restraunt, went to my grandparent's house, went to their neighbor's house and talked with that 90+ year-old lady, went back to the hospital, then came home for supper and sleep. Today, we went to the hospital and ate lunch at the cafeteria there (tasty hospital food). Then I drove all the way back home, including a stop in Conroe so that my mom could do some shopping, while I fell asleep in the car. We finally got back home, and I was actually really happy to see Sadie, because my grandparent's rat terrier is an hyperactive little asshole; Sadie, on the other hand, is a sweetie.......... then we went out to eat, and did normal Steck stuff this evening....... it's good to be home

      My throat feels slightly better... last night it was killing me. Sometime before Tuesday morning I have to write an English essay and think about writing several history essays for a test that I am sure to do poorly on.  I don't think I've left the house this weekend, how sad. I still feel crappy. I still hate school. Thank God for Essay-writing Day, I mean, Labor Day..... hah

I came home Friday afternoon, fell asleep, woke up for a few hours, went to bed at 8:30, woke up at 8 this morning, took a shower and ate breakfast, then went back to sleep until 11. Our El Paso friends are coming here (again), and are supposed to be here at about 2. This sucks...

      "Pre-Cal = ANAL RAPE"  - Written on Mrs. Hobbs's board by Ben Agnor; Mrs. Hobbs then modified it to say "Pre-cal = FUN" Pre-cal is comparatively fun, when AP US History is in your schedule. There is a test tomorrow in that class. That test will = "ANAL RAPE."   I found a great quotation today: "So... before they clean out that closet, Mr. Kirby, I think I'd get in a few good hours on that saxophone." That should make no sense, unless you have read the play  You Can't Take It with You . It is very good.  Nothing else to say for now.

      I think that, by most people's standards, my day would be totally sucky, but by my standards, I absolutely don't care. I don't really believe in bad days - you either have a good day, or a day you don't care about. Yeah... that works. For lunch, I drank a 20 floz. Pepsi and sat across from Mike Simon no other people immediately around us. I believe this was the low point of my day. The normal people weren't there, and I didn't want to up and leave the guy by himself, and I also didn't care... at all.... (This seems to be a mildly disturbing habit I have recently adopted.) When I got home, I fell asleep. Then I ate supper, and did homework. I think the only thing I really do care about is the diction of this blog. How weird.   Here is the brilliant and large comment box... mostly about Mormons:  Comment Box   haha! Take that, Mormons!!!

      Today was really boring. I woke up late. Had a cinnamon roll for breakfast. Waited for the Sitters to show up for lunch, but they didn't. So we ate at about 2. Hmmm, then, I went to Barnes and Noble and looked around for a long while, then finally got what I needed and left. I wrote my English crap, and then sat around for a while. For supper, we got brisket from Rudy's and ate at home with the Sitters. I still have Stats homework, and have to read a chapter for history. That sucks because it's like, 11 o'clock. Devin made a lot of comments about Mormons, etc. It's funny. Read.

      Today I woke up late (noon), and helped clean house, and bathed the dog, and practiced baritone and sat around. Around 7, the Sitters arrived from El Paso. Their son is will be a fish at A&M, and he moves into his dorm tomorrow. In the meantime, he and his parents are staying with us. We took them to Freebird's for supper, and then drove around campus for almost half an hour. Then we came home, and the parents talked while Drew and I went to our separate rooms and watched tv or whatever. I don't talk much to Drew, oh well. I might actually have to get up early tomorrow to do stuff. I know I need to start homework. I have an idea for my 25-line autobio. It should be good.   I smell coffee......

      Hmmmm... it rained last night. A lot. School was fantastic. Hooray school. My pre-cal class is a large collection of people who have no idea what they are doing. They make this very obvious to the other 30 or so members of the class by saying things like, "I don't know what I'm doing" or "Can I copy your answers?"... oh well. The rockathon was dumb. Beano had something very large (Mr. Dixon) stuck up his ass.... seriously. Oh well, sucks to his ass-mar. Tomorrow, some El Pasoans are coming and spending a night or two at our house. The father was a friend of my dad's back in the day, and their son is starting at A&M. ......... okay bye

      bah! I have developed a general disliking for all of my teachers, except maybe Mr. Mac.... Mrs. Schultz, along with most English teachers, is just plain weird. I was putting together my "writing handbook," when I realized that it was the dumbest thing ever. Putting that together wasn't as bad as making 10 drill books, but at least drill books have a purpose. I ended up doing a really shitty job, oh well. Coach Pryor is cool, but he is a coach, and he teaches like a coach. He's on my not-so-bad list. Coach Sanders pissed me off today. We were assigned the first half of chapter 2, which I read, but the quiz today ended up being over most of the second half of the chapter, which most everyone else read. I did nothing in programming; I finished all my stuff. Mrs. Rister is on my not-so-bad list as well, but she doesn't know much of what she's talking about. Band is still mildly annoying. Mrs. Hobbs is interesting, so is that class. I do very little in there. It's odd. Mrs. Walker is also on said list, but, well, whatever, it's physics. blah. Band today was worthless. Dixon is a whiner.  I started homework earlier today, and also finished earlier. I find that amazing. The finishing earlier allowed me time to make this post; I didn't have time last night because I was up until midnight or so reading. But that's what happens when I start school shit at 9 or so.  At the end of last year, I was more than ready for school to be out. I can't help but having that same feeling at the beginning of this year.

      Aghh, such a loooooong day! I actually had homework today, but I didn't do my pre-cal, all two questions of it. I'm glad I'm already in the habit of not doing my math homework; just like last year. I did do my stats homework, and read for history. The history textbook is quite readable; I think that's very good. Um, what else... I went to walmart to get crap for school. I think that store only gets busier as it gets later. At 9:30, it's freakin' packed, and at 10 it's a veritable zoo of people (like me) getting in his or her discount shopping. I also talked with Mrs. Pustay this afternoon; she is the coolest teacher in the school. Spongebab.......hahahhahahaha

      Oh no! I didn't make a post yesterday... but that's because we were setting up our new wireless network, and the computers were kinda tied up. And also because I went to bed a little earlier than usual on account of SCHOOL!!!!! So, school started today; it was okay, I guess. I'm pretty sure I'm going to die with my magnificent course load. Mrs. Schultz is an eccentric lady. I don't feel like typing about my other teachers; they are losers. I'm not so much tired as I'm just in a bad mood. School sucks and band is getting annoying. Oh well, so goes my life.

      Let's see... this morning I almost woke up when my dog started barking, but I turned over and went back to sleep. It turns out she was barking at some Mormons that came to our door. I had a sandwich for lunch. Then went to Office Depot and Max for school supply stuff. I bought some stuff, like, a new calculator. It has the periodic table in German and Spanish on it. I think that is stupid. This afternoon was uneventful. My dad grilled steaks and stuff for supper; that was good. I'm tired from all of the day's inactivities. See ya later.

      Today was a bitch. I woke up at 5:30, showered, and picked up my littles to go to breakfast. That went pretty smoothly. Then band occured, blah. I think that baritone section time now equals talk about sex time, oh well, fine by me. Kelly was tremendously funny. He got paid to run through sections and start riverdancing... funny stuff. For lunch I was supposed to meet my cousin and her friends at Cheddar's, but band got out late, and it took me half an hour to drive there. I think that's what pissed me off the most today, the traffic. So I drove thru Whataburger and took it to my mom's school and ate it while watching tv and waiting for my mom. As it turns out, she was eating inside Whataburger at the same time I was there. Oh well. So then, from about 1:30 to 5:00 I worked in my mom's room... super boring, but I don't really mind. It's like my duty as teacher's child to do stuff like that. I left quickly to avoid being grabbed by another teacher and assigned a task. After everyone was home, we went to the Bryan post office to mail taxes (they are only due April 15 if you don't file for an extension of time like my procrastinating father). The family was in a pretty bad mood by then, so we were going to go to Cotton Patch, but it had a long wait. So we went to Freebird's, instead. I believe this is the third time I've been there without using my gift certificates that are sitting on my desk. Oh well. Then we came home, and I watched the Astros lose. Oh well, again. It's Friday night, and I'm at home doing nothing. yay me! Oh well.

      *yawn* today was very.... something... It rained this morning at band. The baritone sectional was nothing but idle chatting, about gay rights, religion, and John Tell (not necessarily at once). I went to lunch with a multitude of people to Wings. Rob started crying. Good times. After a while at home, I left for my mom's school where I helped until Meet the Teacher Night started at about five. Later this evening, I picked up my yearbook. I've looked through it some; it's moderately disappointing, since it's merely last year's book with different people, and in full color... oh well, not a bad job overall. I did some junk for my mom, like stacking papers that the kids have to fill out. School is about to start, and I'm not ready for it. Go to hell, school.

      OOOOOokay... morning always equals band... For lunch, I came home and ate left over pizza and showered. Then, I went to Rob's to give away the music stand I had been offering. From there, I went to Dr. Pratt's office, where he looked in my mouth and told his assistant to make another appointment for January. Then, I came home, and at about five my dad called me to his office so that I could jump start his truck. Then, I followed him to the car-fixing joint so I could drive him home. For supper, we went to Mi Cocina. It was good, as usual. This evening, I took the dog for a walk, and helped my mom with getting-ready-for-school stuff. Yay for my new blog title; yay for people who make comments... haha

      It's tough to write a blog entry after reading op-eds from  The New York Times , but here goes... Band was this morning: it was really cold and windy. Kristen thought that the practice was going horribly at the first water break... that was really funny. I went to lunch with Rob and Mark, then came home for a while, then went to walmart to get a birthday present for Sloan, then I went to the post office and mailed it. Then, I came home for another while, until Rob picked me up to go to the MSC and play DDR. I think DDR would be more fun if I had been playing it for however long Rob, et al. have been playing it. Today was the first time I had played it, and I figured out that it works better if I actually try. hah! Then, I came home and my family went to Jason's Deli, which I thought I had talked my family out of going to, many years ago... oh well; it was okay. Then, I came home and watched most of the Astros game, which they probably lost. If you read every single word of this post, you are likely a very bored person. If you wrote every single word of this post, then you are definately a bored person. haha...  Also, it seems that my comment service has been intermittent in functioning. So if you feel a dire need to make a comment, and the link isn't there, just try back later. I don't know what's going on, but I won't complain since the thing is free.

      I have nothing to write about. Most of my day was totally boring. Oh yeah, I went to Freebirds with Mark and Erin, and we saw King, Beano, Mrs. Beano (hah), Dixon, and Dixon's brother (a normal-sized person). yeah, anyways... whatever.   public class Patrick { public static void main(String args[]){ boolean crap = true; }} /* Press any key to continue... */ //yay programming!

      Today was really, really boring. My cousin and her husband brought their dog over. She has spent the day with us, and will be here most of tomorrow. She's a black lab... very sweet. I went to Wellborn to get brisket for lunch from these jerks that work at the Chevron station there. This guy left, and the cashier was like [to me]"That Mexican's an asshole. I can't understand what the fuck he's saying," and then, "You didn't give us enough time to put your order together." Then he started talking with his drunk moron buddies about shooting pigeons under bridges. wow... I also picked up our vacation pictures, and the service there was also terrible. Other than that, I played with the dogs and slept most of the day.

      It was hot this morning. At lunch, I went to Pebble Creek; we all got very "close" on the bus... This afternoon was full band with Dixon... I left as fast as I could at 4:00, and was home the earliest I've been so far this week. Then I took a nap until we went to Frittella for dinner. We met a dentist friend of my dad's... it was good. Then I came home and watched "Whose Line." It is a great show... Well, adios.

      Today was faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnntastic. This morning was band. Poor Mac lost it. It was really really hot. I actually didn't mind the heat, or the screaming director, or the repetitive processes. I think that would be considered odd, but I was actually in a very good mood at 11:30. Then I went to lunch with John. We went to the Freebirds in Northgate, and then proceeded to buy drum major gloves, oak leaves, and my captain's bars. Then, the afternoon was band. I only stayed at the band hall until five o'clock today. Then, I came home, showered, and went back to the school for registration. This whole process rather pissed me off. I'm not really sure why, though. I think it's because I don't want to go to school. And also because I saw Ms. Lange... My schedule is in my info. The persons involved in the fiasco of moving me from Chem 2 to Physics pre-AP should be damned to hell, in my humble opinion. I was going to ask the schedule problem lady about programming and wind symphony being the same period, but that lady is a bitch, and I might not even make wind symphony. And I don't want my damn textbooks! I shouldn't have to even see them until, at earliest, the second day of school. At least the parking tag is cool... sorta. In conclusion, I think the registration and an e-mail from big Jason, telling me that he hated band and was sad in Austin, turned awry my excellent day. Well, I'll see you guys later.

      I'm almost too tired to write this, but I'm doing it anyways... I woke up at, like, 5:30 this morning and tried to go back to sleep until I finally got up around 7. Then I went to band... the water balloon "fight" was a pleasant surprise. Then, I went to lunch with Mark and Erin. Then, went home and watered a plant... yeah... Then did the afternoon band thing, and stayed until about 6 so I could teach a freshman how to march, and help Mark and Erin with his drill books. Erin and I ended up leaving after Mac did... that's kinda sad. I went home, changed clothes, and went to Olive Garden with my parents, since it was their anniversary. Somehow, I ended up driving, and since we couldn't decide where to go, I threatened to take them to Dairy Queen. That would've been awesome. We did end up going to Wal-Mart after that, though, to get string (clothesline) for drill books and some other stuff. Then, I walked the dog, took a shower, did some junk and got on the computer. what a day! If you are reading this, make a comment... about anything...

      Morning: Band Lunch: Home Afternoon: Band... then, Dad's office, bank, haircut place Evening: Home... working on DRILL BOOKS Night: Hopefully, a very restful sleep  As you can tell, today was very boring, indeed. These drill book things are taking way too long, although I'm almost finished. I decided that the cover and back needed laminating, so my mom is taking them somewhere tomorrow... maybe. Mr. Rabinowitz made me do push ups because Brynn played in a rest. How fair. Tomorrow looks like another dandy day. Take care.

      This morning I did band stuff, and this evening I worked on drill books. Making drill books is torture compared to summer band. My mom and I worked for two hours, and I still have to punch holes in the pages and highlight each person's letter. You will love drill books; they are great. If you disagree, I will bitch slap you. Good night.

      I like blogging... it's so easy, and it gives me the false impression that someone might want to know what I did on any given day. When I started I learnt myself some html and whipped up a template, but now all I have to do is type an entry and click a button. I think that's how it's supposed to work... Today, I woke up at noon, and had a kolache for breakfast, then read the paper...  The Eagle  had a blurb that I found very amusing... it pertained to high school hazing and initiations, and sited Mrs. Hester as a source, and specifically mentioned band, although not for a bad reason. For most of the afternoon the stereo in my room was playing lullaby music. (My mom was copying cassettes for her kindergarteners.) And I was copying cassette music to CDs on the computer. We grilled chicken for supper; it was good. This evening I went with my dad to his office; that was actually quite hilarious for reasons that are difficult to explain. Well, now the day has ended. Good night.

      Today was a day and uneventful as days go. I woke up late and had a bag of chips and some coke for breakfast. Then for lunch, I made a pizza. This afternoon, I did very little other than go to Radio Shack to get a new battery for my car's remote. We went to Grandmother's this evening, and I had half of a twice-baked potato... I can't think of a good way of wording a joke about half of a twice-baked potato, so make it up on your own. Furthermore, I came home and did nothing. hah......

      I almost forgot to make a post about this stupendous day; I've been talking with (big) Jason.   Band started today, and it wasn't as bad as I had expected it to be. Still, it was boring/tiring, and I feel like I'm doing a very bad job as captain. Oh well, my section deserves little effort. I'm glad Rabinowitz was in a good mood today; it surely won't last long. Nothing else to say... bye

      School is still dumb, but at least I did all or some or something of my homework.  This evening I went with my dad out to my grandmother's to try to fix her car, which we did. And I got to drive her monsterous Buick back to College Station, all the while hoping something didn't go wrong with it. Fortunately, it went fine. Yeah, today was just pretty boring... oh, my intro quotation for my history essay today: "...where the statehouse is the grandest, and the politics the damndest." -from some guy I heard on the CBS news long ago.   I'm thinking about doing some remodeling of the good ol' blog here. Give me suggestions for how I should change it.

      Colonial literature is SOOOO boring! I was really tired after we got back from eating supper at Rudy's with our neighbors, and it took me almost an hour to read four pages of some crap by some Puritan bitch who got kidnapped by some Indians. (this reading also included a fair amount of staring into space and/or sleeping). I didn't do stat, didn't study for history (which I really should have), didn't do programming, didn't do pre-cal (oh wait, I finished it), and didn't do physics. None of it matters.  I hate school.

He may be able to come back to CS in a few weekends.  Um... four day week! yay!!!! but then football game and contest... not-so yay.... I don't know. I have nothing to say.

      I felt like updating my blog... no reason, except maybe boredom.   I watched the Astros lose, and the Cubs win this morning (noon, or later actually, but still morning since it was right after I woke up). So the Cubs have clinched, congrats to them, I guess. Had lunch at Must Be Heaven, it was alright. Then I watched most of the A&M game, and ended up falling asleep. Around six, we went to my cousin and her husband's house for dinner. We took Sadie to play with their dog, and the neighbors showed up with her dog as well, so the three dogs provided some entertainment. It's late... I'm doing nothing, just like I've done all day. lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalallalalala

      Football game was great... too bad we didn't win, oh well. Too bad Mr. Mac got pissed. Too bad Kristen is Mr. Mac's puppet. Too bad I missed that set where I'm the end of a stand-and-hold diagonal by roughly 5 yards. Too bad we messed around on the way back. Too bad people hate band. Too bad I yelled at Michael for talking; I should have been talking with him. but... OH WELL. Band is supposed to be fun, and if the drum major and director won't let us have fun, they need to just... I don't know... get a freaking life.  Enough about that... somehow I did have fun at the game, though.   Do we have stat homework, anyone?

Letter jacket. Some meeting tomorrow. Practice region music. Blah. Essay contest....?  I need to clean my room. I keep throwing papers from my bed towards my desk, often missing, and I also have a lot of clothes in the floor and a chair... there's a chair in my room and a baritone, but it's not really in the way. Yeah, I need to clean my room. The [band, halftime] show looks like crap... my section is retarded.  bye

      SCREW YOU, STATISTICS!!!  Oh man, Mrs. Schultz made tea for the whole class; it was awesome. I heard that she fell and hurt her wrist pretty badly after second period. That's sad.... everyone loves Mrs. Schultz.... except DJ (an arrogant AP'er), who seemed happy that she had injured herself. The class ring sales pitch was sillier than the wrapping paper sales pitches, and that's saying something. I no longer hate history, since it seems like I'm actually getting something out of it. But today I had to tell Coach Sanders who Bush's attorney general and secy. of state were. It's odd that he's such a Bush fan, but doesn't know the prominent members of the administration. After ceaselessly preaching the values of organization, Mrs. Hobbs's notebook quiz had several critical errors on it.  I did my honors band stuff today; it was somewhat interesting. I think I learned more about key signatures this afternoon than I have learned in my whole band career. Actually that's not true, it just sounded good. Anyways, today was pretty blah... like everyday..... ¡hasta mañana, amigos!

      Monday!!!!! I showed up in the history room like all the weirdo girls told me to, and there were not very many of them there, so I just left because they are dumb. English test was eazy. Stat homework remains undone for the last 3 or 4 nights worth, yay! The history debate was like, the funniest thing ever because the debaters were totally involved in it, and actually yelling at each other about federalism versus anti-federalism, which took place over 200 years ago. I still remember Jason Sloan asking people if they were federalist or anti-federalist when we learned about it in 8th grade. hahahha. Um, skipping programming, band, pre-cal, physics.... oh vectors, that's fun. Right after school Mark and I went to Freebirds; it was quite brilliant, and a good time and amount of food to eat for 6-9 practice days. Practice was dumb. I hate how Rabinowitz yells excessively and gets so ticked for such small things.   I wish advocate were longer.

      I have like, several metric tonnes of statistics homework, but..... I don't really feel like doing it so to stat I say "screw you." I did do my English homework, concerning Latin and Greek roots; it was kinda interesting... anyways.  I got back from Ft. Worth today around 2 today, and I must admit I had a better time than I thought I would. Fortunately, I didn't have to stay during the reception; judging by the pictures and my mom's commentary, babysitting 9 kids was a lot more exciting, even if it wasn't always exactly fun. I didn't really do a whole lot. An actual hired babysitter, a high school senior girl, was there, although she and I didn't do all that much. Now if you'll pardon me... a minor rant: A boy, about 5 or 6, was the youngest that we were keeping that evening, and he got all exited or something and wet his pants. He didn't want to change, though, because he was afraid that his parents would spank him when they found out. Somehow, the actual babysitter got him to change by telling him that she was going to wash his pants. When the parents came (late) they were embarrassed. They were embarrassed that their child had wet his pants, but they should have been embarrassed that their son was so scared of them that he was afraid to change. Grrr.... I wanted to tell those parents that their child was deathly afraid of them, but that would have been improper decorum. Ok, end rant...  My dad did some minor things, like not following my instructions on where to go, to annoy me, but overall the trip went smoothly.  *sigh* That annoying emotion, described in the entry below, returned when I got back to College Station. I think it's because I am soo ready to go to college (outside of this town) and get away from my parents and the high school and meet interesting people.  I think I'll try to set up an angelfire account or something to host images that I can either link to or post directly into here, because, well, I can. Maybe by night's end it'll be up and running, or maybe it'll take forever. hmm.... yeah, screw you, statistics.

      Grr.... I'm slightly angry/depressed/tired/angry. That's rather odd for me since I'm always in a good mood (even though I might not show it). Something funny needs to happen this weekend or at band or SOMETHING. Things are so boring and tedious. I feel like slaping someone (no one specific), but then that might hurt them and I would feel bad. Gosh, now I'm not making sense.   I'll be in Fort Worth most of the weekend for a cousin's wedding. It should be super-dull and super-annoying (with my parents).  Oh God...... good night.

      So today in English we were discussing  Of Mice and Men  and all of its grand symbolism and themes and lessons, etc. And I picked up from the conversation that one of the themes was that relationships require time, i.e. Curly and his wife have to actually spend time with each other. So when she asked me what I learned from this novel I responded with that, and she agrees with me and says something to the effect of "you seem like the kind of person that would put time into a relationship." ......................................"what the hell?" In history, Kyle Freeman and I are with all of the girls in the class and will be engaging all of the other guys in the class in a federalist/anti-federalist "debate." I think being stuck with all those girls is good because they actually care about their schoolwork, so Kyle and I sit back and make humorous comments. At lunch, Erin brought bananas; thanks Erin!... and whoever made my banana split. My afternoons are always pretty boring. Band practice is un-blog-worthy, and this evening I mainly watched the A&M/Va Tech game. It was kinda funny, A&M's pretty darn bad. Oh well, I don't care about them.  My blog posts are so long recently. If anyone reads every word of these, I don't know whether to thank you or say you're weird. Either way, continue making comments, it makes this blog interesting.

      Hmm.... hmm.....  Task for my blog readers: find a well-known song or nursery rhyme that has the same number of syllables as the drum break has counts.   So... I don't know. Today was pretty good.  I got gang  raped  hugged by several people in band. Um, I guess most of the day was fairly uneventful, and that's why I liked it. I had much less homework than I have had. Let's see... stories from today. This girl in my pre-cal class started crying right before the bell rang, while she was taking a quiz. She didn't have anything written on it. I guess if she was crying because she didn't finish her quiz, then I don't really feel sorry for her; I don't know... whatever. We measured the flagpole in physics.  Oh... yeah, I finished  Of Mice and Men ... it wasn't that interesting of a story, and I fail to grasp the deeper meaning of it, so oh well.  I'm really bored and have nothing else to say.  `1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./

      That physics test at 7 this morning? Aced that bitch! I got a 98, missing my two points by saying that magnitude was the area under a d v. t graph, when everyone knows that it's actually just distance. Silly me! ....hah.... The rest of the day went fine, as far as days go... I got the equivalent of an A on the stat test, whereas I'm sure I did poorly on the stupid history test. But considering I studied the essays for about 20 mins. and the rest of the crap for 0 mins., I think I did fine. Apparently, the history book review is much less important that I thought, so I'll do a not as good a job on it as I would have. Man... Nina Rubio came to our lunch table and asked us to donate money for some homeless puppies that are making the yearbook or something?... I don't know, it was confusing, and she was going about asking for money in a very incorrect manner. I think I got a 100 on my memory test of all 19 notes of "Scène d'amour." Umm.... pre-cal is getting stupider, while physics is getting smarter. We started trig today... YAY! And so now I have a trig packet to do along with all the other stuff mentioned in the post below. At least I got caught up on stat homework... at least. I've read 40 or so pages of  Of Mice and Men , and, frankly, it sucks. I guess I had high expectations for it since the title begins with a preposition, but oh well. My gosh, this post has been unusually long. Hopefully, you have soaked up every word of it and will apply the lessons I teach to your daily lives.   Just kidding.

      Holy shit! I've read  The Puritan Dilemma  all day... well, actually yesterday, considering it's now in the wee hours of Monday morning. I still have to do essay corrections, which shouldn't take too long, and I might have to do some silly stuff for  Of Mice and Men . And while I'm at it I should probably do my statistics stuff from Thursday and Friday. I also have to be at school at 7:00 later this morning for a physics test. And read  Of Mice and Men  by Wednesday, and write a book review of the book I finished today for history, due Friday. I also have a history essay test today.  Hmm... what else? English test Friday, HUGE latin roots packet due next Monday. Wedding this Saturday. Band practice. Football game. Hmmm, yeah, fun week... See you guys later!

      Oh man, what a sorta-interesting day... No one cares about the school day, it was boring... except for the "DISCO FEVER IN TECHNICOLOR" program that DJ and I wrote in programming. So then, we went to the football game and all. No big deal. It was an excellent game, though; I think we'll have a pretty good season. Our bus driver was a whore, although he did make a balloon animal parrot... unless that was Trevor... but I'm pretty sure it was the bus driver. I sat next to Sam; we had fun, especially lying to to Tony(?) about almost everything: homecoming is where the seniors that graduated last year come back and sleep in the cafeteria.  Right now, I'm drinking bottled water and eating peanut butter M&M's. It's too bad we couldn't finish, or even make a dent, in the Oreos. haha, oh well

      Today: In English, we worked on essay corrections, a fascinating process. In stat, a bunch of people interrogated Coach Pryor about yesterday's test, etc. In history, we learned about how conservatives, such as Coach Sanders, are so much better than liberals, and also how CNN stands for Clinton News Network. In programming, I made this funky thing that made boxes of increasing size and random color; it was spiffy. In band, we sucked on region music. In precal, we did all sorts of crap. And in physics, we practiced for the test, which I am not taking tomorrow, but on Monday at 7:00 in the freaking morning! At band practice, Mr. Mac yelled at Mr. Dixon, who proceeded to pout on the sideline. I actually felt sorry for him because he looked like he had had a really shitty day. I read the "foreign phrases" section of a rather old dictionary for, like, half an hour this evening, since I had no homework. That was weird.  And the storm rages on...

      Stupid keyboard, I can't believe it's not soft-drink-proof. Looks like I'll be making a trip to a local retailer because I also have a lot of other stuff to buy.  I got a 99 for content on my essay! Man, that was awesome!!! But, a 91 on grammar because I unwittingly violated a subject-verb agreement rule. boo... The rest of the day was normal stuff. Yay normal stuff..... but not really.  I have to make up Friday's physics test sometime........ hmmm........ fun fun fun fun fun and History test Friday! and History book review next Friday! and oh geez... long weekend.... bye!

      I had this cool service all hooked up that linked to news from the New York Times, but I later remembered that you need an account to view them, so I took it off.  Man, today was weird... school went fine, but then right after school I got all pissed for some reason. I came home and my dog peed for me. I got really mad then, and started throwing things and stuff. It's kinda funny now. And I spilled dr. pepper on the keyboard. Luckily, or magically, it's kinda waterproof, but now some of the keys don't make that lovely popping noise, especially the "t" key. But somehow things got better. I actually like physics homework.... odd. My aunt called, and I get to babysit during my cousin's wedding and/or reception in a few weeks. This weekend I have a lot of shit to do. Such as, starting to reading the puritan dilemma, or learning how to spell dilemma.... hah. Okay, enough.

      So finally blogger lets me post, and I realize that I don't have much to say. But when do I ever have much to say? It seems like I've not been posting much about what I've been doing and things like that. Just short, thoughtful posts like the one below. I don't talk about my day-to-day activities much because it's all very insignificant. I think I'm just in a sort of pensive mood, which is odd. First football game was this evening, or last evening rather, considering this post will be dated Saturday. It was okay; our band is not very smart. Everyone needs to just kind of chill out. The (my) baritones are bad children: filling each other's instruments with water, starting the "Coates" yell, playing warm-ups so horribly that Mr. Mac stares at Michael. Goodness, it will be a long season. But I have figured out that making Michael behave is a simple matter of giving him a friendly hug. I don't know why, but this seems to work for a while. I feel like I need to do that Breathing Gym stress relief exercise..... On the way home, I listened to music with Sam and Erin; that was fun. I wonder where my Oreos ended up....

      Ummmmmm... today was Labor Day, so all day I labored on essays. I didn't study much for the history essay exam; I think I'll see how badly I do, and then go from there. Meaning, either drop the class or whatever. School is gay. At least there's a football game Friday, that's SOMETHING to look foward to. blah..... blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah BLAH!!!!!!

      The collective creativity of the Steck family culminated in a moment of brilliance when, last night, my parent's realized that they should have named me "Patrick Henry Steck."  Anyways.... I've done quite a bit of homework in the last hour and a half. Still have to write a review of an Andrew Jackson biography (shh... I didn't actually read it). Tomorrow had better be good, or else it will be bad.  Think about it.  I still need new shoes.

      It seems like the quality of my blog has gone down some recently, and proportionately, so has the quality and number of comments.  I just forgot what I was going to continue that thought with..... anyways I now have two write about three pages worth of junk about reform movements and other related items of the kind of-Jacksonian era. And tomorrow I must write a book review over a book that I will not have read by then. Tomorrow begins a two day stat test, and I MUST do my homework, or else my average will suck.  My laziness appalls even me, but school is designed so that I can get away with doing so very little. I'm not sure I really care, though. :(

      Today I was in my I'm-going-to-see-how-weird-I-can-be mood. This certainly peaked during physics, where I played DinoPuzzle instead of doing my physics stuff. Then, I left school hastily, and after taking Michael and Cody home, I went to Wal*Mart to get Goldfish because Goldfish are good to eat. I came home and watched Oprah. It gets dark sooner, this is becuase you can cook an egg on your car during the equinox. If Abraham Lincoln were alive he would surely agree.   I need new shoes.

      Today was work-on-catapult-with-DJ day. He arrived at 10 this morning and left a little while ago. We started out with an idea which turned out to be really lousy, so after lunch we went to home depot and found an employee that had build one in high school as well. He told us all we needed to know and what we needed to get; the coolest of which was his suggestion for the throwing arm, which was a long paint-stirring stick (free from the paint dept.). So our catapult says "Home Depot" on it, which makes it all the more cooler. By the end of the day we had produced a catapult, which could launch a tennis ball 10m... roughly. Within three trials it should at least hit the bucket. Now, I need to work on the advertisement for it.... hmm Oh yeah, sometime today, my grandmother and my cousin and her family all came over and ate lunch and visited and such. I don't think I said more than a couple dozen words to any of them; we were busy on the catapult.  Wow, another long entry (like Thursday's) that people won't read. (haha) //end

      In English we had a politically liberal sub, who somehow managed to get a lot of Bush-bashing. Between Coach Sanders and "Brian", as he asked us to call him, I experienced quite a change in views. I seem to not have an opinion either way, any more. As with many things, I just don't care. Coach Pryor needs to give us more grades, I made 100s on both tests, and had bonus points, but got a zero for my homework grade, and my average: 83. That's gay, but I suppose I should do my homework, even though MATH HOMEWORK WAS NOT MEANT TO BE DONE. We got off-topic in history; the only tangent I remember was about hard apple cider. It looks like I'll be doing Java programming for BPA, but if we only have one team/club, I might have to fight (to the death) with Nathan and/or DJ. Pre-cal is getting dumber still. In Physics, we got a lot of homework, and I realized that I'm getting very little out of that class. Oh well, I must continue with it. I have a lot of homework in it tonight, and I need to catch up on statistics or at least do one of the assignments. blah... And I probably have some English reading to do. Mr. Rabinowitz did something to my valves, and hopefully, they'll stop sticking.  This post has been a long one, compared to the ones of recent weeks. I hope you found my day to be entertaining because I really didn't.  Actually, it wasn't that bad.   bye

I need to work on the history essay and my physics homework, as they are the most pressing items of homework. Wow, this time last week I would be just getting home from band practice. I'm glad it's over. PSAT tomorrow, it should be dandy.  Thanks to (little) Jason for making my new fancy banner (as an animated gif, not a silly applet).

      I never knew that the carnival was actually fun. Why didn't anyone inform me of this in previous years? Oh well... School was unusually boring today. Although it was cool that Mrs. Walker did our homework for us, and that I got a 100 on my test from yesterday (don't mean to gloat). I also learned what Brasso® does to pants (not mine, Sam's). Did some stuff after band practice... fun.  Finished  The Crucible , it was alright.  end

      I woke up late. Watched football. Did nothing. Watched baseball. (Cubs lost... sad). Went to my grandmother's for supper. Came back and started homework. I read act one of The Crucible. And, once again, blew off stat homework. He's taking it up tomorrow, and I've done like, 2 of the 6 assignments, so there's a very low chance of my successfully getting away with not doing it. I think I'll try doing it for this chapter... seriously.   I started writing this post about 30 minutes ago, then started watching tv. Hmm, I guess I have nothing else to say.

      While cleaning my car, I also fixed the cupholder so that it comes out and actually holds cups, but in the process I blew the fuse on the radio. Somehow, the cigarette lighter got wet and shorted out, and now, I have no radio. So my dad says we can fix it pretty easily, and that's good because I love my radio. My cousin and his wife are here to take my grandmother to church tomorrow. So we stayed up late talking with them and eating cake.... boring. Anyways, that's all for now. bye!

      Football game at Belton was fun. Oh crap! I have to clean my car.... that's going to really suck. It took a couple minutes to write those sentences because I was making this helpful and humorous diagram of what happened to cause my car to need cleaning:    It was really really funny, even though there is Coke all over the floor of my car.  The football game was fun.  Presently, my parents are at the A&M/Baylor game, and I think I'm supposed to be cleaning the house, since my cousin and his wife may be coming this evening. Oh well. I should go get lunch or something.  See ya later.

      Wow, today was so awesome!!!  I got my English test back... 73. So, for the moment (and possibly forever), Mrs. Schultz is firmly on my "teachers I don't like" list. To be fair, I didn't write very good essays, but they were still quite intelligent. The thing that most pissed me off was how she wants us to write essays/paragraphs. It's such a throwback to freshman year (no offense, little Jason) that it makes me want to argue with her. She is in love with the eight-sentence format, and barely even encourages us to deviate from it. She gave us a copy of Nisha Rathore's responses, which received a 100 and were written in a tedious, wordy, and highly repetitive style. (I'm not hating on Nisha. She's a good person... I think.) I can't stand the way she wants us to write. Outrageous! In conclusion, I should have been in AP..... Coach Pryor was in a bad mood today. The rest of the day was highly uneventful, with the exception of all the after school things being cancelled. So, I took Devin home, then took myself home, then decided to write a blog while I was still mad about English.... so I did.... obviously. Between the English test (bad) and the band practice cancelling (good), my day evened out.  Okay, enough, bye.

      Oh  I haven't posted since Thursday, so here: Friday, was the A&M game, which I didn't really watch. My family was doing other random things, all of which were highly unproductive.  Saturday was like, major project day. Kyle and I worked on one of the two horrible  Caged Bird  projects. They are un-fun.  I finally finished the book today. The final two or three chapters did little to make up for the fact that the book absolutely sucked. It's merely the story of her life, in trivial detail, which I suppose supports some sort of purpose for her writing the book. Angelou basically says that blacks are repressed and that she has some odd obsession with vaginas.  I haven't made much progress on the stupider of the two projects over the book, but that's what tomorrow is for. The less-stupid is an applet I wrote, yay for that. I should post it on the web so that all the cool kids with the Java software development kit or the Java runtime environment can see it.  Nah. Oh, I also suck at baritone. A lot. This year has been weird, as far as my playing ability goes. I'm not concerned though. The last day we play in band next year is the last day I pick up a baritone. And for that I am happy. (Not to draw criticism from the music people, i.e. Gilbert, I'll still listen. :-)) Hah, two parentheses there.   Gosh, comparatively long blog entry.  I'll see everyone tomorrow. Yay school!

It's going to be not-so-cool. Of course... there is food.  Oh well. I get to read in the car. Or, I should read in the car; a parent might randomly decide that I'm driving.  Ick. I don't like waking up early in the morning.   So, I've finished all my Goldfush and Coke here. I guess it's time to head off to sleep.  Bye.

      arrrr.... I've been really really tired this week. All two days of it. Ah well, I had a number of tests yesterday and today, which were quite annoying, but I think I did okay on them. Now, break begins and I have to read Maya Angelou's wonderful (har) autobiography. Her first one, that is... she's written four or five......thousand.  I also have projects like mad. It shall get done, though... somehow.  This evening was the NHS induction, which was just like most events in the auditorium: unecessarily formal and lacking in content. Anyways, my main point of annoyance is that almost one-third of the junior class was inducted. That's a lot of people. NHS has come to mean very little, it seems.  Ah well. So goes high school.   yay.

      I got up late today. Watched the Weather Channel. Um... hung out around the house. Pretty boring stuff. This afternoon, Mark and I went to the BVSO concert. It was very good. Props to them (including Gilbert). I've been typing my English paper for about the last hour; it's taken a while with the history "test" and talking to various people on AIM. Ah well.  Two day week starts tomorrow. Thanksgiving will be very exciting. Except for the gay Maya Angelou projects (I hope that phrase gets a Google hit), and the going to grandparent's in Orange. At least there will be no school.   hooray.

      I suppose I should make a post about this evening because things actually happened this evening. haha! After school... I came home, I guess.  I went to eat with Josh and his father at Chicken Oil. It was pretty crowded with robotics kids, but it was very good. Much fun. Special thanks to rev ran Later, I took Devin and Little Jason to (Bill) Nye-fest 2003. That was amusing in its own right. Nye was good with copious corny jokes.  For the rest of the evening, just go to Devin's blog; I don't care to type about the rest. It was fun, though. I'm happy I can drive. haha  UIL at Bryan tomorrow. Sunday, possibly going to see a/two fine arts performance(s). We'll see.   My postings have been getting somewhat sporadic, if I don't post again this weekend, have a good weekend.

Here was the gist of it: Last night, I went to Sam's for a computer party thing This morning, we went to Shipley's. I came home and realized that, in my half-awake state Saturday morning, I had forgotten to take my backpack with me from the band hall. So now I have no homework this weekend (yay), but also no computer science competition, which I am supposed to have finished by Monday at noon. Hopefully, Mrs. Rister will grant me extra time, since it's not really for a grade, and she has until December to turn in our scores.  After lunch, I helped Josh with his researching some horse; it took a while. But afterwards, we went to Fuddrucker's for dinner. Fun stuff.  Now, I should probably be doing something productive, but there's not a whole lot to do sans backpack. Oh well, I had a nice work-free weekend. That will make going back to school tomorrow doubly sucky.   Bye

      I think last night was the least attention I've ever paid to a football game. I'm not sure why; it was kinda fun, though.   Emily Day showed up. That was pretty hilarious; too bad Sloan wasn't there to make fun of her. The clap stick things were annoying, but after people stopped being loud with them the tuba section _________. The bus trip was amusing, both going and coming back.  I will conspicuously omit the episode of Kristen's yelling at us and my opinion of that by putting a line through this sentence.   I went with people to see  Elf  today. It's not really worth seeing, especially with little kids being silly in the theater.  My deepest condolences to the Arzacs.

      HOORAY! I made wind symphony! Much rejoicing has taken place.  This means I get to go bother the counselors about my schedule for next semester. Ideally, I'll get a study hall 5th and visit programming that period. It won't really bother me if I don't get credit for the second semester of programming, as long as I get adequately prepared for the AP test.  Some other stuff is existing and so on and so forth, etc., etc.  later

      So.... the "things" today at the high school were just flat out weird. No more about that crap.  The baritone results for wind symphony are now under protest by Brynn. That's a good thing for me..... I hope. However it works out, Dixon is a dork. (hah). There are all these little random things I am supposed to do. Oh well. Whatever. Who cares.   Oh, and Eb major is the best key ever. I say that because it's pretty much the easiest to play on baritone.  C major isn't bad either...... for you C people.

      I thought this was humorous.   Eb major - you are warm and kind, always there for your friends, who are in turn there for you.

      I was unhappy about wind symphony results in the below post. Thank you for your somewhat conciliatory comments. I'm all better now, though. I'm not quite sure how.... but I definately haven't blown the whole thing off by thinking it doesn't matter. Therefore, I will not cry tomorrow when I don't make wind symphony.  School is going okay, which really isn't quite good enough for me, since I have such high expectations for myself. History is kinda screwing my gpa, with the low B or high C that I'll make in it this six weeks. I'm actually working in statistics, and all of my other classes are easy.   blah

      Hmm, things are pretty dull. Wind symphony tryouts did not go coolly. Let's hope I make it, though. After school, I went to Kroger and got stuff to make a cake. Coach Sanders is having a food day for Veterans Day. So, I made a cake and iced it like the American flag. It's really "cute" as my mom said, and since I made all of it myself, it's like, either cool or gay. I'm not really sure. hahahahah My mom made fun of it though, and that made me angry.   In conclusion, I love you. :-D   Now go away.

      Josh has insinuated that I must make a post, so here you are: I slept really really late today. Did some stuff. and some more stuff.... I've practiced some today. I think I'm good at it, but I don't know. I would feel really awful if I didn't make wind symphony.  Josh and I went to Fazoli's for dinner; that was good.  I did my stat homework (woo hoo). I've really not gotten much accomplished. I also spend too much time on the computer, but oh well. This blog entry was lame, sorry about that.  I need something to do.  I need new shoes.

      The Rice game was great fun. Apparently, they lost, but we left early, when they were winning. The  urlLink Marching Owl Band  is absolutely hilarious. Their halftime show for today was backwards-themed. They made fun of what Tulsa spells backwards, and played their signature "Louie, Louie" exit at the beginning of the show. The band announcer also announced the homecoming court for 3002: the queen was "Esther" and princess was some guy's beard. They also said Rice was where the university gave money to alumni, and students drank in class and slept at parties. After we left, we drove around Rice's beautiful campus and the medical center area.  Then we came home; the end.

      So, today was beat/out-black Bryan day. And I think we did that, with Sam yelling foodstuffs the entire bus ride. haha.... Tomorrow, I'm going to the Rice/Tulsa game; that should be fun. I hope it's a little warmer than it was tonight though.  (This is a note to myself to show Jason the picture of his cousin in The Roar.)  Have a good weekend.

      I figured I should post, if only for posterity.  I really hate myself for getting fourth. There's no one else to blame for it. Oh... I'm talking about wind symphony tryouts. I wrote those first sentences, then came back a few minutes later and realized there was no antecedent. Anyways.... I made Coach Pryor's stat page  urlLink (here)  by writing an applet that probably won't make any sense if you're not in stat. I was mildly successful in putting myself in a bad mood today. It's weird how it never quite works; too many funny people.  Sadie is licking her food bowl...... weird dog. I need to make some modifications to the stat applet for CP, and then do the stat project thing, which should be really easy.  Not only do I need new shoes, but I now need a new binder/paper organizing system. This equals trip to Office Depot/Max because stupid Wal*Mart is somewhat lacking in the school supplies department.

      Hmmm... I didn't make a post yesterday. Yesterday was alright. Nothing of great importance, I guess. The end of the six weeks is always a hectic time, and this week is no exception. Things and such..... yes. I've been doing my howework recently, as if I've had some fairy hex me with a work ethic potion. Well, good enough. Cody's "car" got hit.   I'm bored.

      I hate 7am physics labs.   Today was surprisingly not that bad. English wasn't too sucky. I got an A on my stat test. I did fair on the history test (I hope). I did terribly at wind symphony auditions. I got no questions wrong on my pre-cal review, and an A on my quiz (while most others did poorly... heh). And our catapult didn't do as well as we'd expected, but it was alright. I've been relatively busy since 3:35. And this evening I wrote a pimp java program that converts color codes between RGB and hex, then displays a small window showing that color.   I suppose it's obligatory that I say: "I need new shoes."

I suppose I should lookup the freshman cuts for it, too, so I'll know what to practice. Eh.... whatever.  I still need new shoes, but I'm putting off shopping because, well,                                  .... whatever

      Today, I woke up around 12:30, which was nice. A few hours earlier, my cousin brought her dog over for us to keep for the weekend. Around 2, DJ came over and we played with the catapult for a while before we finally got it all set up right. It's actually consistent enough that it gets within a few inches of the bucket each time, although it rarely manages to hit it dead on. Then, we played in the street with our tennis ball which we had been using for testing. Mark drove down my street to pick up an Aggie flag; we said hi to him. Later, we all ate pizza from Double Dave's, which was good. I'm now sitting here.... doing nothing...   I need new shoes.

      I went to Christopher's last night for dinner. I feel special.  I've been on a Text Twist craze of sorts. What a great time waster. When I was at the Modern Art Museum in Ft.

      A variety of subjects will be covered in today's post.  I looked at my alarm clock today, and it told me that today is 12-27. That means the year is almost over. Odd. Little Jason told me about  urlLink this  in the Kroger ad in the paper. I thought it was funny.  I meant to say this yesterday, but: pray for the people in  urlLink Bam, Iran , if you're into that kind of thing.  I'm considering moving this blog to  urlLink Metajournal ; I need to look into that more. I did, however, make an account, and you should too!

      Today I had stat and programming finals, both easy. After lunch, I went out to my grandmother's and gave her some pears. Then, we went to Caldwell and ran errands. I came back home, and put together our family Christmas cards. All 60,000 of them. blah. I don't remember what we did for supper. This evening we decorated the tree. yay that. whatever.

      Ahh, what a lovely day. It started with the history final, which wasn't too bad. Maybe it's because I was about the only one in there that wasn't freaking out. I think I did fine. Then I watched  Monty Python and the Holy Grail , and Mark magically appeared mid-movie. Then, proceeded to Josh's for pizza and hanging out. Then, the band final, which we got out of early (YAY!!!!!!!!!). So, naturally, we went bowling. But first we went to Wal*Mart. Anyways, bowling was cool, even though I think that's where I blew most of my money today. After bowling, I took everyone home, including myself. After being at home for maybe an hour, I was invited to Sweet Eugene's. It's a pretty cool place. And now I don't have to study for my stat final tomorrow. yay. Now, I have to do our family's Christmas cards. Oh well.  Sloan's coming Friday!!!!!

      Oh hooray for our marble machine... 2:49.95 I came home and fell asleep. Then we went to dinner. Then I mindlessly watched TV until about 10.  I like this dead time before finals. Dead except for all the stress generated by the marble machine.  I'm amused by how people annoy their teachers endlessly about what's going to be on the final. C'mon, kiddos.

For some reason, that was amusing.  For supper, I reminded myself of why I dislike souper salad.  Gosh, I'm still really tired. More tests this week-- great.

      Ugh... region: I was the absolute last person to play. Everyone was waiting on the stupid euphoniums, and I was the last one to play the last etude. The whole morning was highly unproductive. And somewhere in there I got a bad headache, which made me mad. I sucked on the music. Oh well. Apparently, I got 12th out of like, 30. I was hungry afterwards, and didn't get to buy anything at the high school because everyone else was waiting for us so we could leave. Fortunately, Mr. Mac stopped the bus at Wendy's. On the way back, my head was killing me, and I was tired.... of my week, of my life... I became contemplative about what I'm going to do with the rest of my life, and I really have absolutely no idea. Sure I have a high gpa, but I can't make a living by having good grades, and I don't want to do something that I hate. Argh, it's when I start thinking about these things that I come closest to "depression." I also slept some on the way back, even though it was like, 6. Hmm... congrats to those who made region.  I watched  The Italian Job  this evening. It was fun. Parade tomorrow; I'm fairly confident that it won't suck as much as today did.

Anyways, something is mentioned about a "colorectal specialist," so I turn to my dad and say, "Who would want to be a colorectal specialist!" And he says, "No shit." That was great.

It's difficult to convey exactly why that's funny, but I thought it was. In history today, we were supposed to be analylizing documents, so naturally I played calculator games.

      My goodness.  To say that I made a slight  urlLink error  when printing out my evil English project would be quite an understatement. (Ignore the large black spot that my broken scanner threw in there.) So, I had to completely re-draw all 25 little pictures, starting about an hour ago. The new final product looks like crap compared to what my first final product  should  have looked like.  Therefore, I am quite angry right now (and also, I should have been in AP).  During first period, I was called to the counselor's office to discuss next semester's schedule and the conflict with programming and wind symphony. It all worked out, but I was, frankly, pleasantly surprised by how nice the people down there were (exept for the EVIL Mrs. Illhay). Anyways, hooray for my counselor; she's cool. Wow.... so many things to do this week. Hopefully I won't screw up anything as badly as I did this first English project here. Man.  Well, it's almost one. I think I'll go do my statistics homework, and read chapter 22 in my history book.    Yeah right.

      The Hearne High School Band's dancing is the shit. Now I must force myself to write two history essays.

      A few minutes ago, my cousin and her husband left for Virginia. They will be there for a year. After that they will be stationed somewhere else for a minimum of three years. This event, like all events, will reshape the way that I look at society.   Hey! Tomorrow at 2:30: A&M v. Baylor, basketball, free admission, 50 cent hot dogs, 50 cent sodas. Contact me if you're bored enough to want to go.

      School started back today. I think I can do statistics homework in 5th period. And pre-cal homework. And physics homework.  My dog is annoying me. I want her to go away so that I can think of something humorous to put here.  She's not leaving.   It says "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" on the building at the base of the clock tower at UT.

      Today I got up at 9:15!!! Amazing. My parents were nagging me to give the dog a bath, so I did. Then showered. Then finished the Texas History Museum Rotunda Floor Jigsaw Puzzle of All Awesomeness. YAY! So I did that 500+ piece puzzle in less than 48 hours, totally by myself. I shall post a picture of it once they are developed. (Sadly, I do not have a digital camera.) Then I did other random chores, argued with my mom some (rare), and eventually drove out to my grandmother's so that my dad could set her prescription junk straight. Then more random things. Then I finally finished  Killer Angels , which is a sad book indeed. It looks like LSU won the "national championship." Props to them on beating OU. USC is still better.  What a boring post. My apologies, readers.

      So last night I went to my room and thought I'd work on that puzzle for maybe 30 minutes. An hour and a half later, I get to a stopping place and finally go to bed at about 3. I got up around noon, and my parents were angry because they wanted me to do stuff. Always nagging me to do things! How annoying. We went to Freebirds for lunch, and then to the Lady Aggie basketball game, which was also my parent's idea. A&M beat Texas State with a score of roughly X to X/2. Then I came home and read  Killer Angels  for a while and did other boring things. Blah.  "Condom" is not a good word for Yahoo Graffiti.

      Today I went to the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin. It was interesting, and brought back fond memories of Mrs. Vastano's Texas History class. (That is Sloan's cue to laugh.) Then, my family and I went across the street and walked around part of UT, a fine university. We later got back home, ate supper, all that stuff. I've been working on a jigsaw puzzle that I bought from the museum. It's a 500-piece, circular image of the floor in the museum's rotunda, which is quite spiffy.

      I am posting so that Blogger makes a January 2004 archive page on the sidebar, and to let everyone know that I am still alive, and to say that I did nothing today.

      Blogger is happy. Metajournal is happy. I think I might post on both. That would keep people on their toes.  Today was a very Borchardt day. Hooray!

      Um, so, two AP tests, one day, not cool. But! I am still alive, so all's well. I now have mad AP test-taking skills, meaning I know all of the stupid directions.  And today, I finally figured out how, exactly to open the silly shrink-wrap on the silly tests! This week is awesomely busy.   It's sad that I have to go to class tomorrow.  Wheeeeeeeee

      Hmm.... so back to old-school Blogger. ( urlLink why ) Hopefully, for not-so long.   AP English was this morning. Not too evil....  Much like the SAT, I have no idea how I did. Nothing to do but wait. Actually, there is something I can do, and that is: totally freak out about my TWO tests tomorrow! Silly computer science and statistics, ruining my open-campus lunch unless I run home quickly.  Man.... I still need to read  The Scarlet Letter  sometime this week. Sunday shall be a day of wonderful sleep. Hopefully.   Have a fantastic evening!
