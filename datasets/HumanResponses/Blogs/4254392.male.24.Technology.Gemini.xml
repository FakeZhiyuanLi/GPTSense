      Lately I have seen simple applications that you can download to your computer from the internet that after seeing them, I think to myself, "WHY didn't this COME with Windows??"  I can see why they wouldn't include office productivity programs like a spreadsheet or database program with Windows or anything else you would buy, but come on ...look at this list and tell me your computer shouldn't have come with these simple tools:   urlLink Timer  /  urlLink Timer-Stopwatch    urlLink Calculator with a tape    urlLink Tree-based documenting and organizing system   OK, some of these may be a bit less simple, but you could see how useful it would be for these to come with Windows:   urlLink An actual cd burning application    urlLink A customizable volume control that lets you see input and output devices on one screen    urlLink A graphics program that does MORE than the stupid paint program that hasn't been updated since the first version of windows!   Alright well, this needs to be finished cause I've run out of time today.  So have fun with these freebies and tell me what you think should also be on this list.  Personally - I think  urlLink Slimbrowser  ought to be on there too.  Be blessed, JASON

           "During the first half of 2004, ISP EarthLink and Webroot Software scanned two million consumer systems only to find 55 million instances of spyware."    - silicon.com news      "While most spyware is adware-related and relatively benign, it's disturbing that over 300,000 of the more serious system monitors and [Trojan horses] were uncovered. This figure represents how real a threat identity theft or system corruption is for users,"    - Matt Cobb, EarthLink's vice president of core applications.    "According to statistics from e-mail security firm MessageLabs (  urlLink  www.messagelabs.com     ), 76 per cent of all global e-mail traffic in May 2004 was classified as spam.."    - silicon.com news      What do you think the world is coming to with this junk that HUMAN BEINGS are making??  Is there a one-stop all in one solution to these problems?  No - and any one-stop fix-all would probably be out-dated and obsolete far too quick for the money you would be spending on such a system.  Is all hope lost?  Have the internet pirates and thieves won this battle?  Perhaps to a particular point they have, and that will change.      "Your best defence, the companies say, is to employ anti-spyware programmes on your machine."     - silicon.com news   This statement I would have to say is not entirely true, atleast when coming at the angle of all the possible threats a PC could get...but we know that not all of it is because of spyware.  However, the fact is that spyware can still get through even with these programs installed.  Worse yet, many of those programs advertised to remove and protect from spyware are actually deceptive forms of spyware - which usually invite more onto your machine.   What you ought to do is inform yourself of the best security measures known to the best geeks in the biz.  These are readily available and usually at no cost at all-except your time to learn.  EDUCATING YOURSELF is the best way-not assuming that one or even a few programs make you safe.  Here's what to do and what not to do.    The DO List:     Install  urlLink Spybot Search & Destroy ,  urlLink Ad-Aware ,  urlLink SpywareGuard ,  urlLink SpywareBlaster , and an anti virus application.  Read the  urlLink Parasite Fight  page, the  urlLink Dealing with Unwanted Spyware and Parasites page ,  urlLink Black Viper's Windows XP Home and Pro Service Configurations  page.  Keep your anti virus updated REGULARLY.  Keep your spyware protection software updated REGULARLY.  Keep WINDOWS updated REGULARLY-If you do not know how, click Tools in I.E., then click on Windows Update.  A link to the Microsoft Windows Update site is also on the Start menu either on the main list, or under Programs or All Programs depending on your version.  For more protection but, with some annoyances like not being able to access sites like ebay, read the  urlLink Blocking Unwanted Parasites with a Hosts File  page.  Use some sort of a FIREWALL...the better the firewall the better the protection.     The DON'T List:     Do  NOT  "click here to download the best spyware blocker and removal tool"!!  Do  NOT  assume you're safe just installing some programs.. ( DO  READ THE PAGES ABOVE)  Do  NOT  open every attachment you get in email - even if its from a friend!  Do  NOT  signup for receiving news or emails from "our partners" when filling out web forms! - ( DO  LOOK AT THE FINE PRINT!)  Do  NOT  ever allow software for downloading and sharing copyrighted music illegally to be installed.  There is a REASON these kind of programs are FREE-besides, should you be partaking in something unethical?  There are plenty of good ways to buy music downloads at good prices...like the new  urlLink Napster .  Do  NOT  list your email address publicly ESPECIALLY on a web site - no matter how trusted it is.  If you need to be contacted by email and need to list an address somewhere, take the time to have a free alternate account somewhere like Yahoo or Hotmail that you can filter the junk with but still access messages that might accidentally be considered spam.  You can always change your address or make new accounts - so use these instead of your real address.  Do  NOT  choose predictable addresses if you can help it!  Avoid the following and anything else that might be in a dictionary: webmaster@, admin@, [words in domain name]@, [common names]@, [common roles]@.  A good bet would be to use initials-but not by themselves.  Do  NOT  do all this and then figure it is enough a year from now.     The Maybe DO List:      Get more information than I have here.   Consider disabling your internet connection when using it isn't necessary.  Consider not having an internet connection at all on your important windows PCs if you can't keep them secure.  I hope that this article becomes a resource for you.  My experience is that this stuff happens so easily to even cautious and experienced people.  I have reformatted a computer and less than one week of letting the customer have it back, they called complaining that similar problems (pop-up ads, freezing or slow computer) were happening!  I even set up the above programs with complete updates all the way around.  Just educate yourself people-you can do it.  Be blessed.

      TreePad is a freeware + shareware tool for creating organized documents and or databases. You can create treepads for virtually ANYTHING. You can import and export most anything with it. You can even EASILY create tree-view based web sites in it. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I am HOOKED on the Business edition. It is way too cool not to share with you.  You can do so much with this that if you even give it one minute of your time you'll be as hooked as I am. There is no way you should go on and do anything else in life with your computer until you get this program and start using it. It comes in a lot of different versions - TreePad LITE which is FREEWARE - Limited functionality - like no word processing features or pictures as far as I know ...just plain text. TreePad, TreePad Plus, TreePad Business, TreePad Enterprise..all of which I believe have word processing abilities.  To stop everything now - AND you've heard enough ...go to  urlLink http://www.treepad.com/  to download your copy and get started on the best adventure you'll probably ever have with a PC.    I am  not  kidding.   I have been a PC geek and guru for as long as I can remember and have been in to a diverse assortment of activities from games to programming, from documents to troubleshooting...and OS installations, etc. etc...and the list will continue to go on. I have not found a program THIS useful anywhere the entire time! Come on, when a program finally comes out that should have been the FIRST program to come out - you know it has to be good. FOR REAL YO - Check it out ...this program should have been made a LONG LONG time ago...it is simple and yet can be very detailed. You know what, I think I will finish and let you do the talking once you have tried it yourself.  I recommend the Business Edition of TreePad. It supports encryption and password protection.  This along with many other programs that aren't nearly as useful(as far as fun and geeky goes I guess..) I would recommend to anyone....     urlLink SlimBrowser    urlLink AdAware    urlLink SpyBot Search &amp; Destroy    urlLink SpywareBlaster    urlLink SpywareGuard    urlLink Norton Antivirus   ...A few more I'll list later..   Now I know there are possibly better antivirus programs out and they probably have better support than Symantec..however, they have been trusted and the software I feel is more trustworthy than anything out there...just get it - and get it working...and keep it updated.  Now all you need is to keep Windows Updated and you'll be on your way to having a good PC time.  Be blessed.
