						   Alley & Si came to stay this weekend.  They arrived about 6pm on Saturday.  Now I know where I live is not the most interesting of places, but it does have its good points.  Like it’s close to Heathrow.  Alley & Si are off to New Zealand for a year.  Alley has a working visa & Si just has a tourist visa. Lazing around in New Zealand for a whole year – lucky, lucky buggers.  I wanted to give them something typically English for supper for their last night in the UK.  So John & Si went to a local chip shop & we had fish & chips.  Then for dessert I had brought in strawberries & cream.  Last night was a bit nippy, but we endured and sat outside until about midnight. Well, it is going to be even colder in New Zealand this time of year (about 9 degrees) so they are going to have to get used to it.  I entertained everyone with my poi.  The glowing ones are very effective.  Especially as everyone was slightly tipsy.  We had lazy morning and then about noon we took them off to the airport.  I took my camera so I could take a piccie of them before they left.  I hate saying goodbye to people, but they needed someone to see them off.  We went into the terminal with them, and after Si had had a full body cavity search – only joking - they had to have theirs bags searched coz they were flying via LA, we had a coffee.  I said that we would wave across the water to them on Christmas day when we are in Australia.  So after some conversation, where I desperately tried not to blub (I think I did quite well) we took them to departures & said our good-byes.  It was once we got home that I remembered my camera in my bag – bugger.  If the plane took off on time they will have been flying for about 6 hours now.  I’m not envious or jealous, but I’m definitely something.  And although we have not seen them much this year – we will miss them.  We wish them all the luck in the world and hope they have the best time ever.  We are up the Heathrow again on Wednesday to collect Dom, Sarah & young master Sam as they are coming back after two years in Dubai.  Dom will have to go back for a couple of weeks after Glastonbury.  So we will be up & down from Heathrow like a yo-yo over the next month or two.  We will all be going camping in Cornwall in mid July for a week before Dom, Sarah and young master Sam will all be off on a years world tour.  Again lucky, lucky buggers.  Hope you all had a good weekend.  Take care.

						   I’m sure there must be some of you who have one of these gadgets.  I’m not talking about the ones you plug in, but the sort you put on the cooker.  It’s my own entire fault you know.  Him Indoors mentioned soon after I moved in with him that he had fancied one of these for simply ages, since he had seen his mate Chris using one – even takes it to Festivals.  There I was strapped for cash & wanting to buy my man a pressie, cos I love him - Ahhhhh.  I wander into a shop & take my pick.  Ensuring that at the same time I also remembered to buy some coffee to go in it.  To start off it was fun.  Him Indoors really likes it.  Then it gets put on the back shelf for a while.  Then, all of a sudden, he is using it every morning, and I’m the mug that has to keep cleaning the bloomin’ thing.  They are a bit of a pain in the arse to tell you the truth.    1,   Take the thing apart 2,   Fill the bottom half with water up to the valve thingy 3,   Then put in the middle, perforated, coffee ground holder, watchyamacallit 4,   Screw on the top half  Put it on the cooker & wait a couple of minutes for it to start making noises like someone with a bad case of diohrea – and it’s ready.  How come when I use it – no problem, but when Him Indoors uses it there is spilt coffee all over the cooker?  Actually I know the answer to this one.  Him Indoors, the other day, when he was asked this question, was quite happy to admit it only happened when he lifted the lid as it reaches boiling point.  He didn’t seem able to offer an explanation why he always lifts the lid, making a mess of the cooker.  Which is maybe why I’m reaching boiling point.  But now the worst bit.  THE CLEANING.  1,   Wait until it has cooled down – meaning leave it hanging around until the following morning in Him Indoors speak. 2,   Unscrew the top half – no problem with that. 3,   Then attempt to take out the wet coffee grounds – our kitchen is currently covered in damp coffee grounds.  As I was trying to tip everything, including myself, upside down and waggle the middle bit free, over the bin, the base slipped, caught the middle bit, which I had managed to get out without spilling, which then did a quite spectacular flight from one end of the kitchen to the other.   Him Indoors is having instant coffee this morning – and then will be given strict instructions on how to clean the kitchen.

						   Hi ya all,  It was even warmer today - about 31 degrees about lunchtime.  In the end the heat started to get to me so I had to take off my suit jacket - not so professional looking I know.  But so much cooler.  My friend Marcia came to stay at the beginning of last week for a few days.  On one of the days we went clothes shopping for her.  I found it quite a strain as she is very slim and is one of those people who can look good in virtually anything.  Major depression I can tell you as I am probably about 5 sizes larger than Marcia.  It has given me some more momentum for losing some more weight.  I have lost a stone since Christmas.  But now seem to have stuck - I keep yoyoing over a 4lb range.  It'll be interesting to see how long I can keep it up this time.   The only failures in life are those people who never try.   Some more practicing of the Poi tonight.  Him Indoors says I am now visibly improving. So here's hoping I won't make a complete arse of myself at Glastonbury in front of our friends.  It's oh so true:   Definition of Outdoor Barbecuing  It's the only type of cooking a "real" man will do:    When a man volunteers to do such cooking, the following chain  of events is put into motion.    (1) 	The woman goes to the store.  (2) 	The woman fixes the salad, vegetables, and dessert.  (3) 	The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on a  tray along with the necessary cooking utensils, and takes it to  the man, who is lounging beside the grill, drinking a beer.  (4)	 The man places the meat on the grill.  (5) 	The woman goes inside to set the table and check the  vegetables.  (6) 	The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is burning.  (7)	 The man takes the meat off the grill and hands it to the  woman.  (8) 	The woman prepares the plates and brings them to the table.  (9) 	After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes.  (10) 	The man asks the woman how she enjoyed "her night off."    And, upon seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that there's  just no pleasing some women.   Hope you have a good summer  Clare :)

						   Hi ya,  I think I mentioned that a few weeks ago I purchased some Poi.  I have been practicing, but was feeling really despondent as I am quite cak-handed and was having real problems with some of the basic moves.  But, then, yesterday all of a sudden a move that I had been practicing suddenly fell into place.  Then once I had got the gist of that one I became able to go from one move to another without having to stop and restart between moves.  So I am now feeling quite pleased with myself.  Him Indoors, eight friends & I are all going to Glastonbury again this year.  Him Indoors wants me to be the incredible performing girlfriend.  So I have about 3 weeks in which to improve even more.  So if anyone out there who reads this is into Poi, I could really do with some tips on how to do the backwards should reel.  Just to bore you all even more, the move I was having difficulty with was the weave.  Anyway, that was Sunday,  Nick has now gone home to Devon.  Him Indoors & Nick really enjoyed the Pixes gig in London – well worth paying the rather high price on Ebay, so they say.  Him Indoors didn’t get up till almost noon on Sunday & both were well hung over – no sympathy from this corner.  The sets I’m really looking forward to at Glastonbury are Goldfrapp, Badly drawn Boy, James Brown (all due respect to him – old & knackered and still performing.  Hope I get a better view than I did at Bristol a couple of years ago), Morrissey.  Him Indoors wants to see Orbital & Nick will probably want to drag us down to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  I also want to see the Flying Elvis’s in the Field of Lost Vagueness.  It was Monday today.  Very warm.  Most people seemed to be whinging about the heat, but I feel we must make the most of it.  Though I must say it does get very warm in our office.  I suppose I’m lucky to have a job where I spend a lot of time out on the road.  Useless info:   Monday’s child is Fair of face, Tuesday’s child is full of grace, Wednesday’s child is full of woe, Thursday’s child has far to go, Friday’s child is loving and giving, Saturday’s child works hard for a living, And, the child that is born on the Sabbath day Is bonny, blithe, good and gay.   The Bridal Gown   White - 	you have chosen right Grey - 		you’ll have far to go Black - 	you’ll wish yourself back Red - 		you’ll wish yourself dead Green - 	ashamed to be seen Blue - 		you’ll always be true Pearl - 	you’ll live in a whirl Peach - 	a love out of reach Yellow - 	ashamed of your fellow Pink - 		your spirits will sink Cream - 	No greater love will be seen   See you around  Take care  Clare :)

						   According to today's regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 60's, 70's and early 80's probably shouldn't have survived, because....  Our baby cots were covered with brightly coloured lead-based paint which was promptly chewed and licked. We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, or latches on doors or cabinets and it was fine to play with pans.   When we rode our bikes, we wore no helmets, just flip flops and fluorescent 'clackers' on our wheels. (I think you will find they were known as spokey dokeys - some old git wrote this). As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or airbags- riding in the passenger seat was a treat. We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle and it tasted the same. We ate chips, bread and butter pudding and drank fizzy pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing.  We shared one drink with four friends, from one bottle or can and no-one actually died from this. We would spend hours building go-carts out of scraps and then went top speed down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into stinging nettles a few times, we learned to solve the problem. We would leave home in the morning and could play all day, as long as we were back before it got dark. No one was able to reach us and no one minded.  We did not have Play stations or X-Boxes, no video games at all. No 99 channels on TV, no videotape movies, no surround sound, no mobile phones, no personal computers, no Internet chat rooms. We had friends - we went outside and found them.  We played elastics and street rounders, and sometimes that ball really hurt.   We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones but there were no lawsuits. We had full on fist fights but no prosecution followed from other parents. We played knock-down-ginger and were afraid of the owners catching us. We walked to friend's homes. We also, believe it or not, WALKED to school; we didn't rely on mummy or daddy to drive us to school, which was just round the corner. We made up games with sticks and tennis balls. We rode bikes in packs of 7 and wore our coats by only the hood. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of - They actually sided with the law.   This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all.   And if you're one of them. Congratulations! We had the luck to grow up as real kids, before lawyers and government regulated our lives, for our own good.   This might put a smile on your face: The majority of students in universities today were born in 1983........  They have never heard of We are the World, We are the children, and the Uptown Girl they know is by Westlife not Billy Joel. They have never heard of Rick Astley, Bananarama, Nena or Belinda Carlisle. For them, there has always been only one Germany and one Vietnam. AIDS has existed since they were born.  CD's have existed since they were born. Michael Jackson has always been white. To them John Travolta has always been round in shape  and they can't imagine how this fat guy could be a god of dance. They believe that Charlie's Angels and Mission Impossible are Films from last year. They can never imagine life before computers.  They'll never have pretended to be the A Team or Famous Five. They'll never have applied to be on Jim'll Fix It or Why Don't You. They can't believe a black and white television ever existed and don't even know how to switch on a TV without a remote control. And they will never understand how we could leave the house without a mobile phone.   Now let's check if we're getting old...   1. You understand what was written above and you smile.  2. You need to sleep more, usually until the afternoon, after a night out.  3. Your friends are getting married/already married.  4. You are always surprised to see small children playing comfortably with computers.  5. When you see teenagers with mobile phones, you shake your head.  6. You remember watching Dirty Den in EastEnders the first time around.  7. You meet your friends from time to time, talking about the good old days, repeating again all the funny stories you have experienced together.  8. Having read this you are thinking of forwarding it to some other friends because you think they will like it too - Yes, you're getting older!!!!

						   Hi ya all,  This is my 1st blog - so be gentle with me.  As I am writing this I am watching Dungeons & Dragons on DVD.  They have just brought it out.  I used to love this cartoon when I was younger.  I can say it's just as good as I remember.  I am really looking forward to going to Glastonbury this year.  It's a shame that it started with such a debacle over the tickets.  13 hrs & dialing the phone about 9,000 times before we got through.  What a bummer for all those who tried for 24hrs or more & still did not get any.  A couple of weeks ago I brought myself some Poi.  For those of you who don't know what they are.  They are sort of balls on string that you swing around.  The westernised versions are based on the balls Maori women used to use.  And I have been told someone used a set in "Kill Bill" to try to fight someone as well.  Anyways, I've been practising, but am not coming along very well.  I think I may just not be flexible enough to do some of the moves correctly.  It is still good fun though & quite impressive.  Especially using the ones that glo in the dark.    I hear there is going to be a stand at Glastonbury where they will give you some tips on how to swing your poi.  I hope they can help me.  Back to new DVD's I have just brought the entire "V" series as well - another favourite from my younger days.  I think I'll watch that on Saturday as Him Indoors & our friend Nick are of to see the Pixies in London.  So I'll have a nice quiet evening in, me, DVD & munchies :)   The clouds above us join and seperate, The breeze in the courtyard leaves and returns. Life is like that, so why not relax? Who can stop us from celebrating?   Take care  Clare :)
