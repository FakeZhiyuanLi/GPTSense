      So, after blazing through and finishing work in 3 hours time.. I had to sit on my ass for another 3 hours while the dumbfucks figured out what to do with the information I gave them! Thank god i get paid by the hour!  Today gave me an interesting chance to observe one of the more amusing aspects of human behavior.. embarrassment (I had to use an online dictionary to spell that -- I need to read more). For the span of approximately 180 minutes, this person, who shall remain anonymous, attempted the simple task of transferring information off of a standard 3.5" floopy disk onto a computer. After swearing up a storm, several calls to tech support (who are apparently as inept as the aforementioned person) and 3 hours of my time wasted, the files got transfered and all was hunky dory! Even though one of two things I hold dear was being squandered away -- my time, I felt a certain sense of reparation in seeing this supposedly evolved and rational creature staring at his laptop like a chimp holding a Rubix cube. It was hilarious. It took all my willpower to hold back from laughing at him. Not at the fact that he could not complete such an elementary task, as far as computers go, but at the fact that the whole time I was sitting there, he could not look me in the eye because he was so embarrassed. His body language alone was enough to make even your average SS agent crack a smile! The uneasiness.. the shifting in his seat.. the nervous pacing.. you get the picture!  Another day, another dollar.

      Well, this is a new and intriguing way of immortalizing one's activites.. well, as long as Blog's server holds up. Nevertheless, quite amusing. I figure that I should post something profound seeing as how this is the first entry among either a.) countless posts spanning the forthcoming weeks, months and years or b.) one or two more posts before the novelty wears off and I move on.  I have experienced a veritable buffet of life's events: You try something because you know absolutely nothing about it.. end up gagging on it and leaving the remainder on your plate for the next to person to wonder about and get their own serving of that experience. Then there are those experiences that you endure because you have to.. it's a pain and leaves an awful taste in your mouth yet you bow to your morals and ethics. Lastly, there are those experiences that you've had before.. you liked them.. and you'd like some more.  At this juncture in my life, I'm sliding the plate forward, sipping my soda and building up the momentum for another round.   I start school (again -- 3rd higher education institution I will have attended in my now 13 semester-long trek through college) at California State University - Sacramento on August 30th. A beautiful and vast tree-drowned campus situated just east of Downtown Sacramento. I won't lie.. I'm excited. The prospect of attending a school I will actually be able to learn AND apply concepts I want. My residence at Sacramento City College, however longer than need be, was a good depressurization time to make the transition (if you could call it that) between the educational enviroments of the US and the Philippines. I loved De La Salle. I would die in her defense or, at the very least, endure physical injury. However, I never really learned anything there, with the exception of alcohol being a wonderful wonderful thing.  I am now more mature (I guess) and am willing and able to buckle down and finish my education. So the coming few months should be an interesting prologue to the next chapter in my novel of a life.

      After a long day at work, I flop behind the wheel of my hoopty and take off on my usual flight plan down the winding Sacramento freeways. It seems to be that it's always at that point -- gas pedal imbedded into the floorboard, engine proclaiming its awakening with a beast-like howl as the tires propel the car forward -- that my mind, at least the analytical sector of it, takes it place at the forefront of my mental activities.. not that I'd imagine that a wandering mind is such a prized possession while operating a motor vehicle. Just as make the transition from merging vehicle to jackass in the blue coupe, some oblivious motorist feels that my brakes hadn't been subjected to enough abuse today and pulls in front of me. I react by slamming on the brakes, downshifting, passing them while presenting the international gesture for "You, sir, are a fucking asshole!" -- see post "Smile for the Birdy!"   My mind took off from there. "What if" questions flooded my mind like the Hoover Dam&nbsp;minus a brick or 20 unleashing the aquatic forces of Lake Mead. "What if I didn't slam on my brakes and buttfucked that&nbsp;truck with my car doing 80mph?" -- "What if my brakes failed?" -- "What if Bubba there in his Jimmy had a shotgun and/or really bad temper?" -- "What if I waited a second longer at each of the 4 lights down Sunrise, would I still have forced to test the limits of my cars braking abilities?" -- "What if I didn't get out of bed today?" -- "What if I never went in to apply for this job?" -- "What if I moved back home after high school?" -- "What if I never moved to the Philippines?" -- you can imagine the swarm I had to contend with.   Always enjoying a good mental workout, I fished out one question and ran with the possibilities. "What if I had waited a second longer at each light?" -- The possible outcomes were more numerous than the stars inhabiting the night sky. I might have missed another light delaying me even further. I might have been hit by an asshole running a red light. I might have pulled along side someone I know. I might be getting home 15 minutes later or 5 minutes sooner than when I did. I might have blown passed a cop and got a ticket. I might have had the urge to stop for a soda and bought a winning Lotto ticket. The possible outcomes from such a seemingly insignificant change in behavior baffled me.   Segway to my conversation with my friend Nicole on faith and religion.   Nicole, a very intelligent, attractive&nbsp;and well-rounded student from UC Davis holds that, as seen  urlLink here , a primary source of anger, agression, angst and anxiety is people's lack of cooperation,&nbsp;compromise and acceptance&nbsp;on opinions and beliefs (ie, religion). Closing one's mind to the opinions of others is a destructive force parallel that of a nuclear weapon or my flatulance after a hearty meal at Taco Bell. Nicole and I got in light-hearted yet heated exchange of opinions where she stated her beliefs and put forth mine. Yet, instead of forcing the other into submitting to that we were right, we concluded by agreeing that although we may not agree with each other's veiwpoints, we accept them as theirs.   Paralell my conversation with Lisa.   Lisa, an unbelievably beautiful person, inside and out, and I had a very similar discussion almost simultaneous to the aforementioned one. Lisa's standpoint on this topic differed from mine as well as Nicole's yet in some instances reinforced Nicole's and other instances reinforced mine. There were many similarities but just as many differences in veiwpoints, supportive thoughts and ideologies. She, too, independent from the discussion Nicole and I had, came to the similar conclusion that an open mind is key.   Three people from three very different backgrounds, living three different lifestyles, with three different paths in front of them all came to the same conclusion -- open up your mind. I'm not preaching that my beliefs are the right ones nor am I preaching that Lisa is the enlightened one nor is Nicole got everything nailed down perfectly. I'm not saying that any of us our wrong neither. There are NO right and wrong beliefs. There are NO right and wrong religions. Everyone's perception of the world around them and their realities will vary due to a web of countless interwoven experiences, paths, teachings and interpretations.&nbsp;I wish could gather all the people of the world into a bar, buy them a beer and say "Yo, Islam, Christianity, Judaism and everyone else -- your religions are all the same.. it's the same circus with the same clowns merely different signs out front."&nbsp;This is what makes the human race such an intriguing yet dangerous entity. It is our variety that makes us fascinating but at the same time is the source of our own demise unless we can learn to be tolerant of each other -- not even accepting, but merely tolerant. It is the sad premonition of mine that this will not happen during my lifetime that results in my near disgust of humanity.   I remain, however, hopeful that with even minute changes in our behaviors we can achieve this Eutopia of living TOGETHER as opposed to just merely with each other.   &nbsp;

       I made an interesting revelation today.. not really revealing, more of "understanding" and "comprehending" -- We want only that which we cannot have.    &nbsp;  Try and keep up.    &nbsp;  When you have something or are able to avail of something, you no longer desire it. Desire is for those that don't have something and are unable to attain it beit an object like a car or money, person or achievement. Indeed there are many things in my life that I have that I take for granted, but there are just as many other things, if not more, that I don't have and desire. I can't help but feel a sense of disgust towards those that have what I desire yet take it for granted. I'm not envious, bare in my mind. I just do not think that those people who have what others desire and don't appreciate it are worthy to have it. Again, beit an object, person or achievement. I see so many people in this world who do not appreciate what has been given to them and it literally makes me sick. "Why is  she  with  him ?" or "She did what to her Lexus?".&nbsp; I know that there may be some instance where not knowing the whole story but then again, reality is in perception.    &nbsp;  There are some specific things I am referring to, but I think this applies to everyone and everything in general.

      "The future is coming. Are you ready?" wails the lead singer of rock band full on into heavy ripping achieving balance and flow amidst what is seemingly random noise. An art mastered by very few. That verse hit me as subtly as a 2x4 to the back of the head. Am I ready for the future? With the acceptance of the future one must concede the past. Am I ready for the future? Am I ready to part with the past? If not, is there anything I can do to change it?  No.  There is nothing one can do to rectify the mistakes of the past. Actions, like Sharpie markers on the paper of time are permanent. It is that permanence that is the source of my angst and anguish. It seems like such a simple thing to do -- I'll just go and take back what I said to her; I'll turn back time and not do what I did.   That's the only hitch. It is SAID. It is DONE. If you find the remote control for the universe, hit rewind for me and go back to 1997 so I can warn myself not to fuck up. Not to let go. Not to let her drift away. Not to forget how I feel.  Somone once told me that I am in love with the idea of being in love. No. Close, but quite. I  AM  in love, but not with the mere thought of being in love. I'm still in love... with her. If I'm fortunate enough that you are the "her" I'm speaking of and you are reading this, then it should be apparent to you that even after 7 years, I still feel. I am not an asshole. I'm just lost. No one is given instructions to life. I didn't and still don't know what to do.   No one should regret the things they did and didn't do, but life is just that -- regrets and fond memories, missed and taken opportunities, hopes and fears. We are defined by what we've done, what we're doing and what we are going to do. Denying our past and damning it is merely supressing a part of who we are. We damn the past, we are daming ourselves. We embrace the past, we are embracing ourselves. The same holds true for the present and future. I do not regret the past. I am thankful for it. Good times and bad. Happiness and sorrow are equally appreciated because I am who I am today because of it. The person I will be tomorrow is a summation of who I am today and who I was yesterday.   Yes, I am ready for the future, but I'm not forgetting the past.

      Today was a good day.  Didn't have work.  Didn't have to be up before the ass crack of dawn.  Got my paycheck which was a little more than normal so now I can go get my tattoo finished.  Found out that a very good friend of mine is getting married.  Spent a relaxing afternoon with two young, unbelieveably beautiful,  lucious and heavenly ladies  -- an afternoon of swimming, pizza and a movie.  Yessum, today was a good day.

      Ok, I have never be accused nor diagnosed as being completely normal.   Driving home from work today, I get flipped off by a passing motorist. I don't know if I cut him or what his deal was. It struck me as a completely random occurance and my inital reaction was to smile and chuckle a little. Then I got to thinking (run and hide now!), what would the average person's reaction to randomly being flipped off would be. So I took the following notes after flipping off 20 complete strangers on the freeway for absolutely no reason whatsoever:  8 people flipped me off in return  6 people had perplexed looks on their faces  4 people quickly looked away  1 person gave me a totally blank emotionless look (probably stoned)  1 person smiled and laughed -- cool, someone else out there who thinks that being flipped off on the freeway is humorous!    The point of the story: If someone flips you off, smile at them.  Imagine how much less stressful life would be if a main source of stress, agitation and frustration (read: road rage) would become a laughing matter. Just think of the possibilities.

      Ok, it's become apparent to me that I spend far too much time in front my computer supported by the following:  A.) I revamped an entire website (www.teamzx2cali.co.nr -- check it out, i made it hehe)  B.) I have completely run out of ideas of songs to download -- I've complete playlists of Evanescence \m/ Lacuna Coil, Metallica, Godsmack, Bone Thugs N Harmony, Atomship and Linkin Park.. all other bands I dont care enough about to research and download all their songs  C.) Researched, listed and planned out my school schedule.. a full MONTH before I can register  D.) Exhausted my entire monetary worth on eBay  and lastly..  E.) Porn sites have lost their appeal  *puts up away message* "I'm away from my computer.. I hear there's life out there, I'm venturing out to discover it!

      I walked out the front door last night and witnessed something that seems very rare in todays society -- hundreds of people just "hanging out". The people in this neighborhood were out and about enjoying a balmy summer evening. I have seen this many people in this close proximity become the recipe for a fairly volatile event. However, last night did not follow suit. People were walking up and down the street greeting each other pleasantly. Kids were running about - which usually aggrivates me, but tonight actually brought a smile to my face - and playing with each other. Complete strangers were engaged in light-hearted conversation. As the sun bid it's farewell, our eyes were directed skyward. A 10 minute long spectacle of light and sound soon filled the northern half of the sky. Colored sparks danced about in different choregraphed shapes accompanied by the auditory half of an explosion that ranged from a mere hiccup to a chest-shaking boom. For those 10 minutes, everyone was a kid again. I looked around at the faces of the people gazing up and they all shared a childlike innocence about them. The wide eyes, the mouth hanging half open in awe at this display in celebration of the greatest country in the world. God bless America!

       Some might call me mean.. others might say its wrong.. but you know what, this is my fucking life!      I discovered a source of immense amusement today. It's all about timing. Whenever you see someone (it's best if you know the person, but its more hysterical if you do it to a total stranger) who has been in the bathroom a while come out, clap and applaud as though you just watched your favorite band finish a 2 hour long show! That's it! I nearly vomitted from laughing so hard at work today when we did this to several people (we were counting a section near the entrance to the restrooms for the better part of 2 hours). When someone (male or female -- we don't discriminate) exited the restrooms, the five of us would clap and cheer! Thier reactions and looks of utter embarassement were priceless!      I know it sounds juvenile, but so am I! Try it.. it's fucking hilarious!

       Doesn't it suck how nothing seems entirely perfect? My employment situation is where my thoughts are directed with this question. I enjoy doing my job. I enjoy the challenges it produces and the working enviroments I am emmersed in (with the exception of battery acid *rubs eye*). Most people hate their jobs, but love the people they work with. I am the complete opposite. I love my job, but I cannot stand my co-workers.       The thing that drives me loony the most frequently (and this goes for humanity in general) is the ideology that each person thinks they are better than everyone else. I long ago came to the conclusion that no matter what I do -- unless I am the only one doing it -- there will always be someone better, stronger, faster, smarter, better-looking or more capable than myself. I realize this. I have come to terms with it. I embrace it. It's not a defeatist attitude. It's reality. Take sports for example. I felt I was one of the best at playing roller hockey in my school. Roach was bigger and stronger than me. Fine, but I could still mow people over like a Mack truck through a flowerbed.  JR could outskate me on a bad day. Ok, but I still outrun 90% of the people we played against. I could rip slap shots harder than Marco, but Marco was a hell of a lot more accurate than me. I'll live.       I'm not trying to discourage anyone. My point is simple: If your entire life is driven by becoming the best, you'll hit failure after failure and never be happy.  My philosophy is strive to be one of the best.  It still has the satisfaction of knowing you're near the top, but none of the heartbreak of not being where you want to be at. I'm one of the fastest and most accurate auditors in our district. Cool. I was one of the best athletes at DLSU. Sweet. I'd like to think I have better than average looks. Given the nature of this category, I can live with par. I take joy in knowing that I'm near the top in a lot of things I do, but since I strive to be among the best, I don't kick myself for not being the best.      I can't help but laugh at people who bust their ass and come just short of being the best. Especially when I'm the one who beat them out! (c=

       As much as I don't want my blog to be watered down with rants about how bad my day was (which unfortunately that is what this entry is about to become), I feel I'm entitled some leeway.      I'll start off by saying that my job is not exactly the most difficult job in the world. We essentially scan barcodes with a handheld laser barcode reader. At its roots, that is our job description. if you have a pulse and a functioning index finger, you are more than qualified for this job. However, scanning a barcode is more than our average auditor is capable of doing as I spent 2 hours fixing count discrepancies. Generally I don't mind doing this because it is technically part of my duties as a Supervisor, but at what point is enough enough? If your job is to scan barcodes and record totals, but those totals are inaccurate then what fucking good are you? You obviously didn't do your job if I'm having to count what you have already been through. This one auditor had so many discrepancies that we had to back everything he counted on the day out of our system and recount. So, effectively, he got paid for doing absolutley nothing. I couldn't help but laugh when I overheard him on his cellphone saying "Yeah, I'm  at work.. " It took everything in my willpower not to rip into him with "You're at  your job  but you're not fucking working!" This same auditor came up to me and showed me a section he counted was correct and accurate. I felt like telling him "So, you did your job.. you correctly did what you're being paid to do..  did you want a fucking cupcake?!"       If you know me, you know I'm a laid-back generally mild-mannered individual, but God help me that I don't jump this asshole when I see them tomorrow.      Ok, I feel better now.
