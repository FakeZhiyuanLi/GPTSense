      Today, alot happened  --i finally woke up around 1:30-2:00, at luiz's house, after they were moving a bed downstairs.  then about 10 mins later, robb decided to call me and tell me that we had band practice at 2.  Well i looked at the clock and it said, 2:13, so it was kinda weird sence i had JUST woken up. so i got up, got dressed, and then found at that luiz was having people over later that night, so i decided to call taryn to see what she was up to.  Well i called her and she had to work i was completely sad, cause i always call her when she has to work. So i just told luiz and zach later, and went to robbs to have band practice  --I got over to robbs and they were all upset, (they as in Tyler, Jerry, and robb)  becuase they couldn't get a hold of Jack.  Well i guess they didn't know that jack works every day in the morning cause he has to pay alot of bills off, so i told them that and then about 20 mins later jack calls and he's on his way.By the time we got to start pracitice i went out side to check my phone and i had a voice mail, i called it and taryn called me and told me that she got her sister to work for her so we could hang out, That makes me ULTRA SUPER happy. But anyways, We only got to work on our new song today, becuase robb had to be at a concert that he set up with his booking company he started call black candle booking.  So we got started.  It all went well, and we got some new parts, WHICH I HELPED with. i felt impressed. i don't know if were gunna use it yet, but it would be cool if we did, if not, oh well i'll live.  After that it was about 5:30 and we had to leave.  -- After that i went home, ate, nothing special, then i picked up taryn.  We went over to luiz's and watched Pulp Fiction but i had to take her home early so we didn't get to see the whole movie, well i did, she didn't.  I chickened out on my plan to tell her but i'll do it next time.  But its alright, we just sat on the couch, and cuddled, it was fun, So after i took her home went back to luiz's and just watched the rest of the movie and talked about multiple things with him cause he's like the coolest guy you will ever talk to.  he has answers for everything.  I love him like a brother, but don't get me wrong, i'm not gay.  but around 12:00 i went home cause i had too other wise i would of slept over at his house.. AGAIN, but when luiz leaves for brazil, i'm gunna miss him like no other, but oh well i think i'll get over it, i hope he has a good time.  Anyways thats it for now.. WEEEEE -Dann

      So yeah.. i pritty much JUST woke up. -- TORNADO WARNING -- so i had to go down stairs into my boring basement, and today ruined my plans for the rest of the day.  Oh well  -- Yesterday, i didn't really do anything yesterday, i talked to taryn on the phone for a while,  Chickened out AGAIN, and then after that i worked more on my website for liquid paris records, it should be starting to look ALOT better i hope.  Then after that i had my friends Zach and Drew come over and we playing Playstation 2 for a few hours.  Then Zach left, and my mom brought me home food, so Drew left.  Then i continued my quest for nerdness, and played for a while longer.  Yeah... thats pritty much everything i did. BORING i say.  -- Today,  I was hoping on calling taryn and hanging out with her today, but i don't think that will happen unless this storm clears up... NOW... damn it was worth a shot.  But i guess i'll just call her on monday, cause sunday = band day.  Anyways,  i don't think i'll be doing anything today but write lyrics, work on the webpage, jack off a bit(just kidding), and play some games.

      Ello, my name is Dann Brodhead  i'm 17, and i live in omaha nebraska  today was quite boring/fun at the same time --My band started a record label with other local bands here in omaha.  Were calling it Liquid Paris Records, were opening a venue to play shows at in maybe 6 months to a year so it should be EXCITING! So they needed a webpage so i'm making them one. Its not going to be excellent, but its not gunna be crappy upon another, i'll see how it comes out  --Had band practice, almost have our 6th song completed, it feels good. We're recording up at my school soon to get a demo disc to hang out at random shows to get known around town. WEEEE  --Thats all i have for now... -Dann
