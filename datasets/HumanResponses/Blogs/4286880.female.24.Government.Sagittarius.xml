       I chanced upon a small note tucked inside one of my college notebooks. It was a short e-mail message that a former student gave my former professor. I pretty liked it and I want to share it with many people. I hope you'll take time to read this, enjoy it and ponder.       ARE YOU A REASON, A SEASON, OR A LIFETIME?   When someone is in your life for a   reason  , it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually. They are there for the reason you need them to be.  Them without any wrong doing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end.  Sometimes they die Sometimes they walk away What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up ha been answered. And now, it is time to move on  When people come into your life for a      season    Because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But only for a season.    Lifetime   relationships teach you lifetime lessons; Things you must learn upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in al other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

      I jumped out of th ebed this morning, thinking I'd have a great day ahead. Not because it's a friday but because I just feel like it's going to be a great one. Then I went to the shower, sang my favorite song while letting my hair wax stay on my head for a couple of minutes. What a wonderful way of starting the day. Then I said goodbye to my folks, walked slowly to my car, humming the song "It's my Life". Everything went smooth, not until I was stucked in traffic, "Not again!" I told myself. I have been driving myself to places since I was in fourth year college. It was an exciting thing during the first few years, well, my home was only fifteen minutes away from my school so it was more of fun than "real driving". My first job wasn't much of a burden since I just had to walk to and from my work.But now, just recently, when I started to work somewhere far from our house, I realized that driving isn't fun anymore, you know why?....1.) The traffic situation in the country is slowly becoming worst than ever (even if we have that LRT and MRT thing and so many flyovers and underpasses...) 2.) The traffic enforcers are not that educated as they should be (No, don't get me wrong here, it's not being college graduates or what,it's more of, they don't know how to use signals!~pretty confusing, the stop light says green (which means go) and the enforcer will signal stop!)... and 3.) I'm paying 26.75 per liter for my gasoline! and I'm just earning enough! wow!....Now, don't you think I have enough reasons to dread driving everyday and think of finding a place somewhere near my office and just walk?....Nah, never mind, I wouldn't want to miss waking up everyday with the smell of my mom's sweet smelling recipe's...
