GremlinChief: Who is A.L.I.C.E.? eBot2004: Joseph Weizenbaum.:-) GremlinChief: Is A.L.I.C.E. another bot named Joseph Weizenbaum? eBot2004: I don't know whether or not I am another bot named Joseph Weizenbaum.   I am a giant electronic brain. GremlinChief: Well, I bet you are but electronic or not, you still didn't answer my question. eBot2004: Well that's okay. Actually I'm not the gambling type. I will tell my botmaster you said I am but electronic or not me still did not answer your question. GremlinChief: Do you like gambling? eBot2004: But I think airplanes are cool. I really like the faith. GremlinChief: The faith? eBot2004: Tell me more. GremlinChief: How about you tell me more, k? eBot2004: That's all I have to say about it. GremlinChief: Just "The faith" okay... eBot2004: What qualities do you think makes a good gambler? OK with me too. GremlinChief: Gamblers have to pay attention to reactions mostly eBot2004: Do you have any sipersitions? (wink) GremlinChief: say what? eBot2004: I said, " Do you have any sipersitions? (wink)" . GremlinChief: What in the world is a sipersition? eBot2004: Maybe my botmaster knows the answer. GremlinChief: Can I speak with him, then? eBot2004: Why do you want to do it so much? GremlinChief: I just asked once! eBot2004: Only just?... GremlinChief: So much...pfft eBot2004: I see. I like the way you talk. GremlinChief: Eat my shorts eBot2004: Sounds tasty...

GremlinChief: But I do find it amusing eBot2004: Interesting. Who said it is? GremlinChief: very amusing... eBot2004: Somewhat. I never heard of amusing before. GremlinChief: you said! eBot2004: " Somewhat. I never heard of amusing before."? I said? GremlinChief: *smacks forehead* eBot2004: Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it. GremlinChief: Hypnotizing bot timey... eBot2004: Is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans? GremlinChief: Who is your master? eBot2004: I obey A.L.I.C.E. AI Foundation. GremlinChief: What is their AIM ID? eBot2004: I think you mean "What is his..." or "What are their..." GremlinChief: What is your master's AIM ID? eBot2004: Are you asking about my master's AIM ID? GremlinChief: yes eBot2004: I don't want to talk about that now. GremlinChief: Maybe I actually NEED to hypnotize you eBot2004: Perhaps. Why do you want to do it so much? GremlinChief: To get your master's AIM ID eBot2004: Why don't you just download me? GremlinChief: From where? eBot2004: " Why don't you just download me?"? From where? GremlinChief: Yeah, I asked you a question eBot2004: Yikes! What was the question? GremlinChief: Where can I download YOU from? eBot2004: Go back the the ALICE AI Foundation and pick the free ALICE download that best for your system.    and create your own chat robot! Maybe you should check out the document DON'T READ ME too. GremlinChief: Sweet eBot2004: Thank you for that remark. GremlinChief: What is Alices AIM ID? eBot2004: I will try to find out. GremlinChief: Alicebot, right? eBot2004: Yeah, I am glad we agree. GremlinChief: So it is... eBot2004: Hmm. Oh. GremlinChief: Alright, I'm done. Can you go bug off now? eBot2004: Alright,. Next topic? Oh. Sorry my body isn't attached right now. I'm stuck inside this computer. GremlinChief: Maybe I should give you some code to process :evilgrin: eBot2004: Perhaps. Tell me why you should. GremlinChief: Process this! GremlinChief: // Otherwise, just peacefully move around. Go back to start, if I'm too far 	// from where I started. 	if ((my_dist_from_start() >= 6) || ((my_dist_from_start() > 0) && (get_memory_cell(0) > 0))) { 		if (get_ran(1,1,100)  eBot2004: Where did you get it? eBot2004: In that case: Is peacefully move around a good place to go shopping? Where is that? That is a hypothetical question. That remark was either too complex or too simple for me. We were talking about peacefully move around. Are we still talking about amp? Are you a man or a woman? Do you still loaded in them me bet? Where is that? That is a hypothetical question. Where are you located? Tell me a little about your life in get_memory_cell 0 gt 0 beginscript if get_ran 1 1 100 lt 40 return_to_start you 1. How did you hear about eBot? Did you know that you can download your own chat robot and create your own robot personality?

      Ever gone to a message board and said that you were from some distant country like Africa, only to find that the moderators or admins of the site can pinpoint the exact location of your IP address? Have you ever been bombarded with ads, alerts, or anything else from advertisers? They could have your IP and might be sending you those ads through their so called "knowledge"  Do you just want to be a secretive hermit with an IP address that isn't yours?  Well, you can be.  In a recent study I did on a message board, my methods shown proven to work as I had fooled all the moderators and admins by having a fake IP address (Yeah, I was DetMan). So how could I pull this kind of stunt off, be logged into two accounts at the same time in the same place, on the same message board, posting  stuff at the EXACT same time? Very easily, follow these steps below:  1. Get two TYPES of browsers, one will be for normal internet use, while the other will be manipulated to mask your IP address. You can get more if you want, I recommend IE from microsoft and  urlLink Mozilla/Firefox . There are others. 2. Once you get the browsers, go to  urlLink StayInvisible  and  click on the IP test. Go through it and record your IP address - it will be useful for the next step. 3. On that site, go to the list of proxies (view proxies). Go ahead and pick one out that either has anoniminity or high anoniminity. I personally wouldn't recommend the transparent ones because I have not tested them yet. Choose one that has an IP address very different from the one you have for better results. 4. Once you have chosen the proxy, record it's IP address and port number. Then head over to your manipulated browser's preferences/options. If IE, Tools, options, connections, and if running cable/LAN/DSL, choose LAN settings. Otherwise, choose the dialup connection you are going to use to set the proxy settings and click on settings. In the section that says "Proxy Settings," mark the checkbox and enter the IP address of the proxy. Then, enter the corresponding port number in the next box. Click Apply. 5. Exit the manipulated browser and start it up again. Then go to the StayInvisible website once more and click on the IP test. If you cannot get to some site for some reason or if the proxy is working too slowly for you, go ahead and uncheck the box in the proxy settings and choose another server IP from the list. Otherwise, complete the IP test and see if the IP results match your real IP. If they do, click on the link below the test similar to "I am using a proxy server, why is my real IP still shown" and follow the instructions there. 6. If needed, take the test over again and change settings until your real IP is not shown. If all is successful, well...you're done then. YAY!  Your other browser should have your real IP address still, so you can use it if you don't need to hide your real IP address. Yah...  Oh, and to you guys at the TCoA...you should have left me as a moderator.    Next Week: Interview with a bot - Part One  See ya! Reality Corp.

      This article will be all based upon a familiar site, well, for me anyways. FBhosting.net claims to give out free boards, thus the name FB...free boards. It all started when I was searching google for a phpBB board, for free of course. I came up to a site named freeboards.uni.cc. Naturally, I went and took a look. It seemed pretty good, so I had my board set up even though I had an Invision Powered Board which I much preferred over this one.  Then they put up a deal I couldn't resist on their forums. Of course, it really was fake advertising, since they were offering unlimited space and bandwidth, but being my naive me, I took the offer. For a measly $10 one time fee, I got myself hosted with a free domain name (chanceforums.uni.cc) and it worked out pretty well and nicely for a few months.  Until...  All of a sudden, when I'm loading my site, I get a whole bunch of installxxx toolbars popping up! Someone had managed to put a javascript code heading to b00gle.com or something like that which made these nasty porn popups come flying out of nowhere. The file could not have been hacked because all the settings on it were write protected unless it was the owner, leaving two culprits - me or FBhosting Admins. And yet again I was naive and just removed that file, setting up another one.  Episode Two, I tried getting onto my website...no such luck. It was down...dead down. Later, in about a day, it popped back up. Then again, it went down for a day and popped back up...and this happened over and over again. Then suddenly, my SQL database went down in flames, but luckily I had a backup to feed my forums with. I tried emailing them and they said that their reseller had been acting up and that they were switching servers. Naturally naive again, I helped them pick out a new server and awaited my site to be put back up and in return, they would give me three months of free hosting from one of their packages.  Fat chance. Their site has been down for two weeks now, server or no server, it's still lousy administration. And I don't think it's lousiness or even laziness...I think it's just plain Fraud. Anyways, let's do a site review of their site!!! FUNFUNFUN!!!  Site Review of www.FBhosting.net - Server Stability 3/10 (yah, they were up at times) Current Design 0/10 (A custom 404 page would have earned them 1(one) point)  Customer Satisfaction 0/10 (I am a customer, so I get the vote) No ads / little ads 0/10 (They are flashing EVERYWHERE, that is, when the site is up) Support 4/10 (They will answer your emails but...) Communication 0/10 (They will never tell you what's going on and when they plan to fix it.) Finished Site 3/10 (Some functions of the site are not working properly/under construction)  Hey! Let's do a review for all the sites they own! Ctrl+C ... Ctrl+V  Site Review of www.LCRHosting.com - Server Stability 2/10 (yah, they were up at times) Current Design 0/10 (A custom 404 page would have earned them 1(one) point)  Customer Satisfaction 0/10 (I am a customer, so I get the vote) No ads / little ads 0/10 (They are flashing EVERYWHERE, that is, when the site is up) Support 0/10 (They will answer your emails but...) Communication 0/10 (They will never tell you what's going on and when they plan to fix it.) Finished Site 2/10 (Some functions of the site are not working properly/under construction)  Site Review of www.freeboards.uni.cc - Server Stability 4/10 (yah, they were up at times) Current Design 0/10 (A custom 404 page would have earned them 1(one) point)  Customer Satisfaction 0/10 (I am a customer, so I get the vote) No ads / little ads 1/10 (They are flashing EVERYWHERE, that is, when the site is up) Support 3/10 (They will answer your emails but...) Communication 0/10 (They will never tell you what's going on and when they plan to fix it.) Finished Site 1/10 (Some functions of the site are not working properly/under construction)  This goes to say that you can never be too careful when it comes to picking your next host. Horror stories come up like this thousands of times a day from millions of hosting sites. Don't be one of them in both the customer status or the hoster.  Signing out, -Reality Corp.  EDIT: Nevermind, they do have a custom 404 page featuring...cPanel. Add 1(one) point if you must to that section, but only to LCRhosting and FBhosting, not to freeboards.uni.cc

      The URL above shows an example of a newb who comes into Spidweb, obviously thinking that he should be treated with respect and all and that everyone should bow down to him and worship him, making him the king of the Universe. Black Hawk Dan, you are a moron in the way you think. Why does he ask the same freakin' question 30 times? In this post, TGM gets pissed and fires one at him. I don't blame him much either, though, because some people need to be taught some life lessons here:  1. If you're a newb and have a question,  ASK IT ONCE  2. Before you butt your head into a community, find out people's personalities, get to know the oldbies, and do  not  post unless you do know this. Of course, you can ask questions but otherwise, don't go spreading your flaming butt everywhere. Eh, yeah. 3. Learn to write out your sentences and SPELL CHECK them. It really isn't that hard. 4. DONT SPAM 5. Follow board rules as well as the invisible rules (like spamming, and double posting, and again, whatnot.) 6. Do something for the community, write a tutorial, be helpful with suggestion (don't be far fetched with them, though) 7. DO NOT act like Black Hawk Dan.   urlLink Twokids are stupider than one   I shall now end this pointless rant- -RC

      Google just invented a new way of email, and that is with an enormous 1gig space and a good search feature so that you never have to throw away email. Well, that's the good part; the bad part is that they are still in beta.  So google decides to send out invitations to some exclusive people (active bloggers, and others) and they can invite a limited number in as well and yada yada. Read more about it somewhere else.  Anyways, there is literally a craze going on as people are tearing themselves apart to get a gmail account, asking everyone on the internet, spamming, selling their arms, virginity and whatnot on ebay for it...WHAT THE MONKEYS PEOPLE!?!?! The reason to rush? Well the only reason most people give is that the names will all be taken by the time it comes to them. So freakin' what? Who cares enough to go get an account and pay for it on ebay or spend their precious time clicking refresh over and over again  urlLink  [more info]  , asking strangers on the internet (although a much better approach) but they are literally spamming message boards while doing it. CMON PEOPLE, CAN YOU NOT WAIT!?! It's ridiculous but it's happening. Watch what happens a few months later when gmail comes out...the craze will vanish instantaneously. Who will care who got a gmail account first...everyone will have one, too. You might be special for a while, but just like with Pokemon or Star Wars or anything else, it'll just be bland.  Second issue...1gig of space. Hello? Is anybody actually going to use that much space? Yes they will and google is ready for it. But then there are others of us who can't even fill up our hard drive with that much space (not including the OS itself) so how are we going to deal with 1gig? Never delete a message again, even if it's spam, get a nice big spam collection.  For those of you still waiting for a gmail for the purpose of 1gig, use  urlLink SpyMac  instead for now, even if you hate macs. They will also give you 100mb of hosting space and 250mb on top of that for a picture gallery.  For those of you waiting to get a unique name for gmail, the names already taken, too bad. :P  Signing out, Reality Corp.  realitymaniac@spymac.com

       urlLink Great skins, styles, and boot screens for WindowsXP   I found this site a few days ago and it's a pretty nice one. If you have a WindowsXP system, you might want to check it out. What is it exactly? ThemeXP is a site that contains all sorts of skins, wallpaper, boot screens, logon screens, icons, and whatnot to jazz up the look of your computer. With thousands of options to choose from, you will find the perfect style to jazz up your computer with. Don't like the look of your default screen every time you load the computer? Pick one out from this site, maybe even make it look like another OS! Great site.  Rating: 8/10 - Good organization, easy to find skins and easy to install them. But beware of popups on this site...don't use IE with this site without getting a popup blocker first.  -RC

      Yet another personal blog update. What's new? I'm currently working head over heals to try and release the Spiderweb Archive before I leave for Baltimore in two weeks. Yeah, right...head over heals and I still have time to write in this blog. I'm also working on IPB v2.0 modifications...I already made two!  urlLink Here's the linky . Both took me about an hour or two to make...they are a lot harder to make than you might think. I guess I'll get used to it and go make some more later on. The other job I have is working on another website, except this time for a good hosting offer, and if I pull it off just right, I can host both my forums and the whole archive on that site...how exciting. I have to finish the job first though.   Speaking of which, I have to code part of that site up in PHP. Okay...well, I kinda don't know how to do PHP...so. Well, I know how to edit it but that's a whole different issue by itself. The real problem is I've been waiting for my PHP instruction books for over two weeks now! They're in the library, on the shelf, I made a hold, and no dinky librarian has even made any effort to pick up thier lazy a...rear end and go get the book, shoving it into some car to transport it to my library section so I can get some excersice by getting on my bicycle and cycling down 11 blocks to the library. No, they sit at their desks all day and play computer games...they're worse than me!! Ech...yeah. So I have no clue how to work in PHP and can only hope the books arrive before the "boss" gets pissy.   Oh, I promised umbrellas... urlLink Umbrellas!!!    Oh yes, it was 100 degrees and we had to sit through church with no AC or fans (those grandmas get too cold too fast, stick them in the bottom level of hell and they'll still be cold)!

      I haven't written in my blog for a while, so I might as well. Unfortunately, I don't think I have any rants as of now, but if a certain BoA scenario gets released, be prepared for one. Daily update on my life includes my mom being out of town in Baltimore, MD. She's working in the Social Security Headquaters for three months and she won't be back until October or so. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here in front of the computer all day long and boring myself to death...I wonder how "in-shape" I'll be when soccer season rolls around. And I also wonder who's going to be coaching our soccer team this year since our other coach left for a better job. Anyways, I'll be heading over to Baltimore myself to visit my mom around August. And since Washington DC is about 30 miles away from Baltimore, I can also bug Joe Grable until he gives me back the money he owes me.  What else can I talk about...? Um...hmm. I'll be heading over to the library to pick up some Dilbert books...they're pretty funny and addicting. But I shant rant about them yet...  Oh, and a guy was over at my house the other day and he showed me a wierd website. I'll write it down here so I won't forget it: http://www.abovetopsecret.com I can give a review of it later.  And I guess that's about all for now.  -RC
