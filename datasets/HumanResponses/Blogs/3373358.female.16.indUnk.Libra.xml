        Congrats! Your a Pure Angel! Angels, as far as most of them go, are all compatabile creatures, but Pure ones simply are symbols of God. Pure Angels always appear when a child is born, when a rainbow is seen, or when someone shares their first kiss. They never grow old, an can appear in the shape of a naked woman with white, bold wings. Pure angels are the carriers of god, and show their love to everyone in the world.    urlLink   What Kind of ANGEL are you?

      Weather forecast in Pinas – Bagyong Enteng is moving out of the country. Or maybe he’s now out? Ewan. (Hay, ganda ng umpisa ng entry ko noh? Hehe) Yesterday (Friday, May 21) I went to Holy Word with Sedsed. I visited the students, since it’s the last day of summer classes. Jason, Levi, Allen, Ivan, Jem, Jen, Len, Princess were there. As usual, they’re all bored to death, so I just chatted with them. So I got kicked out of the learning center because the teachers were reporting me to the Registrar, Ma’am Leonie. They said I’m causing disturbance in the Learning Center…distracting the students. Whatever. The kids were bored, and they missed me, what was I to do? Haha, Miss Julie B aka Ma’am Georgie was really ticked off with what I’m doing and how the students were not reacting to her orders. I mean, she’s all, “Quiet students!” and the kids won’t even listen!  I miss Andrew. Last time I saw him was… hmm..  secret . Hehe. Whenever I hear the song Roses by Outkast, I remember him, because that’s his fave song as of the moment. ^_^ Haha, he has a crush on the Caroline girl. I think she’s cute, so I don’t care if he likes her or not, it’s just a crush. As if he’ll run off and leave me and go marry her, right?   Oooh, I got a crush…actually, it’s not new, cuz I’ve been watching him for a couple of weeks now, but yesterday when I went online I had the chance to get a pic or two of him. Here.    His name’s Christian Bautista. He’s a singer here in the Philippines. He was in this singing contest Star In A Million, but I think he didn’t win, maybe just a runner-up, (I have no idea, because I don’t watch that) but boy.. when you hear him sing…man…. I don’t know, I just like guys with voices like that. He’s like, the Josh Groban of the Philippines – daw. I like his voice, his songs, and his eyes.   Actually, when I think of Christian, I usually end up thinking of Andrew. Which is not actually weird, because it’s only natural. Although, this is sometimes my train of thoughts: This singer Christian Bautista, dubbed as the Romantic Balladeer, whosevoice reminds me of my former crush Angelo… this autistic/special child weirdo that I like in church. And Angelo reminds me of papa Vic Zhou.. the Taiwanese actor/singer and F4 guy, hahaha, because Vic is Lei, the autistic one in F4… and Lei reminds me of Rukawa Kaede the anime bishounen from SlamDunk because they like to sleep a lot, and Rukawa reminds me of Andrew.   Why?  Well…..let’s see. Andrew sleeps a lot. I mean, during break, you would find him in his office sleeping. And he really hates being disturbed…unless it’s me. He’s usually quiet, and he gives off this aura, like, you can’t talk to him because he’s so serious and looks kinda scary cuz he’s unapproachable and all that. And he also plays basketball… and he’s also very good at it. And his voice. I just love his voice. Whether he’s singing or just talking. I like it. He’s usually an aloof person around the people he don’t know or don’t like, but when he’s with me and our barkada, he’s the total opposite! Oooh, Janna( annaj ), Johanna( keppiez ) and Honey( ehnhey ) said they were really surprised that Andrew’s really makulit, madaldal and everything…he’s like the exact opposite of what they thought. That’s because he’s relaxed with them, and besides, he said, they’re his future cousins-in-law, so he should be used around them. Haha. Eherrmmmm……why am I talking about him? Maybe it’s cuz I miss him? Wahhhhh..  Countdown till school starts: 16 days before the Freshman Orientation, and 24 days before classes really starts. I’m actually anxious to go to college. I mean, I can’t really describe how I feel. I’m anxious excited…something like that. I’m really looking forward going to school, but I’m also  not  looking forward. Gets? I just want the summer to  not  end.   Now I have to go, I still have to finish a chapter in TcoNtC, I need to post it in winglin.net by Monday. If you’re curious of what it is, but I guess you’re not…and maybe, just maybe… It’s a Gao Xing and Barbie ficlet. Or fic. Whatever. Who watch MVP Valentine? Know the guy who wears the number 9 jersey in Qi Sui High, Cheng Feng’s wild, always angry teammate? That’s Gao Xing. He reminds me of Mitui from SlamDunk. Same attitude, same reason – a bad knee. Haha. Got me blabbing again. I gotta go. Just check out http://www.winglin.net/fanfic/koishii if you’re really really curious. If not, then…whatever. So bye.

      i made some minor changes in this blog of ours, but mind you, it took me 2 hours justto do that! I did it last night... see? Hahaha, again, maybe DUROG na naman ako. I have no idea.   Mom, Dad and Sedsed went to Antipolo. Wala lang, kwento ku lang. ^_^   Oo nga pala, yesterday I attended Braving CAS, a seminar for a select group of girls that'll be going to UA&P. It was a whole day seminar, and it's actually quite fun. I was shy and quiet at  first, but by the end of the seminar I'm already the loudest and pinaka-makulit...I was even named the best actress. Wahhhh.... ^_6

      I watched Troy on Monday and it was great! I'm a very big Orlando Bloom fan but I didn't like his character so much. I loved the costumes, especially the colors. And the water looked so beautiful. So blue and clean. I miss swimming in the ocean. The last time I swam in the ocean was in the summer of '99. I can't wait till I go to Hawaii in August. I'm gonna spend as much time as I can at the beach. It'll be really fun cuz my friend Jenn is going to be with me and the kids are gonna stay home with my husband. ;o) I finally get a vacation. I haven't been away from my kids for longer than 3 days since they've been born. I can't wait. I definitely need a vacation.

      I stay home with the kids and so my husband is the only one working and money has been tight. He makes enough money to support us but something happened last month that we needed to take care of and rent money went to handling that. Yesterday we got a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit and we only have $900 for rent. Rent is $1400. And I'm stressing out where we are going to get the rest of the money. Plus we still have to pay our electricity bill which is $150. I keep wanting to ask my dad for help but I don't think he will. When I was planning my wedding I asked Auntie Maira if she thought he would pay for something for my wedding but she didn't think so. When Annabelle got married she had to RENT her wedding dress and that is something I could never do. So, what I decided to do was just have a small civil wedding then on our 5th anniversary have the big wedding. But during times like this I wish that I could turn to my dad for help. My mother-in-law has already helped us so much. Without her help we wouldn't be living in this house and then without my mom's help I wouldn't have a car. I hardly saw my dad when I was growing up and it's only through Auntie Maira that I was able to know that you all were my cousins and you were on Friendster. And like I told Jas, I'm happy that I have contact with you all now. I'm close to my mom's side of the family because I grew up knowing them. Hopefully I will grow close with all of you now that we have contact with each other. I try to blog as often as possible but right now things are just not doing well and I'm already depressed enough for 50 people, I don't want to get you gals down too. And another thing is that my mom's aunt is very sick. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in May and she is not doing too well. I am going to Hawaii in August and the only way I am doing that is my friend is going too and she is lending me the money. Then when I come back from Hawaii I have to look for a job but I love staying home with my kids and actually I wanted to try and have my baby boy...FINALLY. ;o) And since I am a high risk pregnancy by the time I am 4-5 months pregnant I am put on bed rest so starting a job and then having to go on disability after maybe 6 months is pointless. But I know that it is maybe not a good time to have another baby since money is so tight. But like I said, my husband makes enough money to support it's just this thing we had to take care of that last month that is making money tight right now. But by September we should be back on our feet. So, I'm confused and stressed out and it's making me depressed. Well, that is the story of the day kiddies. ;o) I promise to blog more. Maybe not everyday but hopefully once a week at least.

      There's this tradition in UA&P called Hell Week. This is the time when freshmen students are the "slaves" and the junior students are their "masters". Wahh... I think it's pretty cool.. although the clothes we need to wear? Ehrm....  Monday: High School Uniform Tuesday: Baduy/Wacky/Geeky outfits Wednesday: no class..so no dresscode Thursday: Superhero/Fantasy gear Friday: Block Theme.. See info on the next paragraph. ('c')  Yesterday I had to wear my highschool uniform. I actually missed wearing it. When I was putting it on yesterday morning, I had this feeling that I'm going to Holy Word. It was just a lil feeling, I can't even describe it. When I got to school I'm kinda nervous and also shy cuz..I don't know...I have this weird feeling like I'm the only one wearing a uniform today. That kind of feeling. So during the whole day I'm in my uniform..and most of us freshmen followed the rules. ^_^ It was nice.   Today I have to wear Baduy/Wacky/Geeky outfits. I don't know what to wear! I'm already baduy. And wacky. And geeky. haha. So why would it matter? Wahh.. I have to describe what I'm wearing now..*I'm at the ADB Library, by the way*..I'm wearing my yellow mickey tee, jeans, blue knee-high scooby doo sock on the right foot and red shin-high mickey mouse sock on the left, my blue&grey skechers rubber shoes..and my dad's peanuts neck tie. haha..when i get to school i'm gonna wear my blue 5/7 polo..so i look soooooooooo baduy. i hope so. haha. wish me luck.  I haven't decided what to wear on Thursday. I'm supposed to be in superhero costume. Well...I have no idea whatto wear. I want to be Raven (Teen Titans), but I don't have violet boots...haha, and then 2 of my blockmates said we should be the PowerPuff girls. They appointed me to be Buttercup cuz they said that's how I act anyways. Wahh...I don't know where I can find an outfit similar to that...Wahh...Help...!!  My block decided to have a Prom theme, I guess. I'm gonna wear my lavender strapless gown..haha, I wore that on my debut..I know it's not a prom dress, but what the heck..it's still a gown. Plus I'll be wearing my rubber shoes cuz it's a friday and I have BioLab. Bwahahahahaha.  All in all, I'm kinda excited with all this HellWeek thingie happening. I just hope this week will turn out great.
