         man.. i'm so mad.. my bag and shoes didn't come in time.. and my old bag looks so dirty.. man!! grr.. i'm so mad.. anyway... instead of sleeping in.. i woke up frickin' early today.. my mother forgot that i needed to go to marianas medical center for this skin test thing.. anyway.. all went alright.. i have to go back there on friday.. hopefully i'll get to skip the 3rd day of school because of that.. lol.. and then after that we went to kfc to buy food which wasn't so interesting.. i stayed in the car.. and then we went over to the good old business office at mcs.. i stayed in the car.. heh.. it looked so cramp in the business office so i decided not to accompany my mother.. i wanted to check the homeroom listings but then i realized that i wanted to keep the suspense level up.. heh.. so then we went home and ate.. after my mother left i called felly and we talked for quite a while and discussed how sucky it is that our bags and shoes didn't come yet.. but i guess that's okay, at least i have someone that's going through the same thing as me.. lol.. ok bleh.. then talked to bezzo.. talked about her trip to the philippines.. unfair.. she has new shoes and a bag too.. lol.. looks like she had much fun on her trip too.. anyhow, after that i talked to besto [heh.. it keeps going].. she kept asking where we were going to be and i told her repetitively but she kept saying that we might not be there.. heh.. we might just not.. lol.. jokes.. so anyway.. school starts tomorrow.. i think i'm set.. except for the whole bag issue.. i can put up with my shoes i guess.. so imma go to school early tomorrow cause i don't like it when there's alot of people looking at the list.. i prefer looking while there's no1 there.. whee.. i'm excited but also nervous.. hopefully my bag and shoes come soon!! heh alright imma go prepare stuff.. laters..

         ok so it's the last day of summer for the mcs people.. lol.. and on wednesday we're back in school.. anyway.. i still don't know how to work that "hello" thing.. how the hell am i supposed to send pics here? anyhow.. i had a long conversation with felly =) hehe.. man i haven't spoken with her in the longest time.. so yeah.. i still have to call bezzo and tell her where we will meet on wednesday.. heh we're weird.. we have to find out a place to meet.. but that's alright.. we call it 'tradition'.. gee i wonder who the hell is even reading this.. no-one even knows about my blogspot yet.. well except for michelle.. but i doubt she came here to check it out..     the only reason i'm here is cause i can never seem to figure out xanga!! too much html.. well there's html here too but it's just pretty simple.. chris is asking if this thing works.. he should check it out and see if it does.. yay joleen's online!! lol.. ok imma go now.. imma watch tv and then sleep in tomorrow! my last day of sleeping in! or at least till a day comes where i'm just really tired and don't feel like going to school.. heh.. orite.. bye
