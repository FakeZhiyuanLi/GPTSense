      Today, I finished the&nbsp;history section of the WarLords website. It is in full detail of how the clan came together, and how we dominated in clan games such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and how we are going to be great come later this fall. Also, my review for ESPN is underway and will be on the site within the coming days.

      Welcome my humble audiance! It has been a week, I know, but you have to forgive me for that summer reading and ESPN are corrupting my life! I went through the hell of a 3 hour wait to get that game, and I came home with not only the greatest football game ever made, I came home with a job offer at GameStop! I will be putting up a review for ESPN NFL 2K5 later this week on my clan website which you can visit by clicking on the warlords site link on your right.

      Today the WarLords had a clan match with another bunch of guys on Xbox Live on the game Counter Strike. In short, we got pwned. I couldn't believe how badly we played in that match. We were missing a couple of our best and we just didn't know the maps as well as they did. I tell you though, every game was tense. There is no&nbsp;thrill in everyday life as exciting&nbsp;as a clan match on Xbox Live. You just have that nervous, life or death feel, and when your talking to your teamates, who could be as far away as&nbsp;Eastern Europe,&nbsp;its like you are making real decisions that could cost you the match because all your buddies&nbsp;can hear your every word. It's just awesome. Anyways, we got pwned and now we are looking to get more reliable people in our clan so we will be more prepared next match. Don't forget, if you are interested in joining our clan, please visit our warlords website via the link on your right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Man ESPN and Madden are coming. I have to say that looking at my budget, I have to go ESPN Football 2K5, but I know that I want both. Along with that I have to get Rainbow Six 3 Black Arrow. That is going to be the first clan game on LIve! to feature all of the brand new Tsunami features specifically designed for clans. I know that I haven't been posting alot lately, but that is going to change as soon as I finish reading my summer books for school. While this is usually not the case with gamers, I am and honors student and am trying to get in Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. If I were to ever get there, it would be awesome for me. Go to school, play some baseball, and then go to the Giants games afterwards!

      If you saw my xanga, you would know that I was leaving for the greatest city in the world: San Francisco. Well, I'm back and let me tell you that it was an absolute blast. I got to ride the cable cars, go to Pier 39, eat all the great foods that Frisco has to offer, and then I got to go to my favorite site of all : SBC Park (I still call it Pac Bell Park, sounds way better!)It was there that I got to watch my San Francisco Giants trounce the Arizona Diamondbacks 9-2. It was a great weekend and probably my last for this summer as I have to get my lousy summer reading done.

      Well, today I picked up Voodoo Vince and man, this game is kool. Take Crash Bandicoot and Make him into a cloth ragdoll, and you've got Voodoo Vince. It's a really fun game and it has an interesting concept. You're a voodoo doll named Vince and you are the third favorite doll of your witch. The witch is kidnapped and you must go save her. From there you get voodoo powers that let you do harm to yourself and then transfer the pain to your enemies. All along the music is nice and jazzy with some blues thrown in. All in all its a good game and for 15$ you can't go wrong! Not all can go well, however, as I now have one of my two summer books that I must now read and do the work for before August 23rd. This is when I just have say "Aint school a bitch!" I haven't been able to relax this whole summer because I've been worried about getting my work done. So I think that one of these days I have to lock myself in a room with no TV and just read the whole damn first book, which is only 600 pages!

      Well, not to sound like a really, really, worn out cliche', but this is my first blog and I hope that all of you like what I type about the things that I like or dislike and my own personal thoughts and reasons on them. I got this idea from watching TV and decided that it would be cool to have something about me on the internet I could use to have my opinions heard by the people that I want to hear. Right now the two things that come to mind is Baseball and Video Games. Baseball because the Giants game is on right now and video games because coming this August is the beginning of the peak of Xbox Live, when we will finally have some new games to play after the drought that this summer has been. I will be looking forward to owning noobs at the sport of football come ESPN NFL 2K5 and Madden NFL 2005, not to mention owning 40 year old ex-militant beer-bellies come the expansion pack to Rainbow Six 3, Rainbow Six 3 Black Arrow. Well that's all for tonight. But check in tomorrow to view my thoughts on games, sports, and life itself.

      I finally finished my summer reading and am now enjoying my vacation in Orlando Florida where I am going to all the parks and I am living life grandly in a Time Share at the Orange Lake Latitudes, the largest timeshare corporation in the world. I bought Madden 05' and I think that it is absolutely amazing. This has easily been the best year for video game football ever in my opinion and Black Arrow is the start of the Xbox Live revolution this fall. There are so many things that I want to talk about, but so little time right now. I will be back on the 20th and from there my blog will finally be allowed the time need to be updated daily.
