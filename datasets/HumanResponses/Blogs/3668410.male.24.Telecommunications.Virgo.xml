      Wow..my first post.This is the first time i blogged. Heard it through the net, it sounded interesting, so i decided to try it on. For my first post, i dont have much to share.just finished watching england versus switzerland. England did pretty well, scoring 3-0 against switzerland, but they still have a lot to do if they are to win the Euro Cup 2004. Maybe Greece would win it.Nobody would expect Greece to win it, and they did pretty well against Spain and Portugal.

      Assalamualaikum,  &nbsp; Strange thing is happening in Malaysia. Just three day ago, a girl throat was slit by her crazy negighbour. And another maid was found stabbed. Malaysian lots is fast becoming a cowboy country. We are constantly have to be in alert and aware of our surrounding as to the threat and hazards. Mothers have to be protective of their childrens, Fathers protective of their family, COmmunity leades protective of their community, and so on. The safety of&nbsp; of our loved one is our&nbsp;responsibility. But the best protection is Allah protection. We must be always ask and make du'a to Allah to protect our family. Be sincere because Allah can read our heart.  Peace to All Umair  &nbsp;

      Assalamualaikum,  This morning, my friend car window was broken into at  Sungai Tua,Ulu Yam . The person who did it managed to snatch my bag which contain Al-Quran and a few books. The price for the stolen item is hardly below 30 rm but my friend had to pay about 500 Rm for replacing the window.  It is sad and depressing whenever you read in the news nowadays.With all the snatch thief and gangsters around, Malaysia low life seem to be multiplying by the days. What can drove a person to resort to a ife of crime. Are they totally devoid of any human compassion when they are commiting the crime? Perhaps they are desperate for the cash as the high cost of living is soaring up, or in need for a quick fix of drug. WHatever the reason,it does not legitimate the actions of this few.   A much needed approach to this increasing problems is to pomote a more pro-active police force. How many often do we only see the police react to the situation rather than done sometehing to prevent it.Is it sad that whenPerhaps only by the pressure form the ministry or the media can mobilize the police immediately. But only for  few month. And then they would remain quiet until the next disaster strike. The Pattern of the behaviour is so constant that it is no wonder that crime flourishes in malaysia.   So to all of you reading this post, please be careful and do not leave your bag in the car..  peace..Assalamualaikum Musafir

      Assalamualaikum,  i'm finally get to write the Blog after so many week of posponing it. i guess i'm not addicted to blogging yet. i'm still jobless and would welcome any body who know any opening for an electrical engineering somewhere.  After been jobless for a while, it does get in your nerve when you wake up every morning and realize that you have nohing forward to do. You tend to get lazy and feel depressed. Time like this is here you have to fight your inner urges to just lie down and instead to stand up and find that job somewhere. Cos somewhere out there, Allah have set us our Rezeki ( Fortune) and up to me to find it.  My grandmum is already awake and talking after been bedridden fo quite sometime.She was admitted to the Hospital last Thursday after a mild stroke and Sufering from a not be able to remove her faeces from her body. but after a week in the hospital, she seem fine. hopefully she is discharged tomorrow. time like this, you tend to take all the postive news, knowing that tomorow, the postive news may just be for you.  Peace All  Umair

      Assalamualaikum...  This saturday is kind of mundane today. Not much is happening. tomorrow is my cousin birthday party. But her actual birthday is next week. I bought her a Barney VCD. SHe loves barney. But for the sake of me, i cant understand what is the attraction of a giant pink dinasour. Man..that thing is dangerous. Barney is probably lulling kids to a false sense of security before devouring them li'l brats.  If i was a 5 years old, i would be watching out for those razor sharp tooth. Then again, what could be more scarier, a man eating dinasour, or a singing dinasour. I would probably freaked out at the sight of a pink dinasour belting out catchy song that always get stuck in your head, over and over again. Just plain freaky.  Well, hopefully she loves the vcd. There goes the television for the weekend. She would be playing the vcd all over the weeks.  Salamz

      Assalamualaikum,  Last Saturday, a wonderful thing happened to me. It is truly a life changing experience for me. Just short of the big thing. I am finally engaged to a wonderful girl. 7/08/2004. Althoughthe wedding is still a few month away, the engagement does change few things. It is a practise to show sign that one is commited to the commitment of getting wed to your fiancee. Or inother word, a commitment to commit. Double the C word. The best thing is that this is a arranged wedding ( sort of).  Can love come after wedding? Or must one truly find love first before commits to a wedding. IMHO, Love is truly a powerful trap, that managed to destroy families and ruin many lives or Bring family together and cherishes and fullfiled one life for ever. Its just how the way you approach love.  Choose a woman for her beauty and her appearance can wither.  Choose a woman for her wealth and her wealth can dissappear.  Choose a woman for her personality, and just wait for the mood swing.  Does anyone actually have a formula on how to find the perfect love. With my eye, have i witness many couples clashed with each other when misunderstanding arise, many family broken because of infidelility and when lust rules over love.  Modern society should learn the different between love and lust, the mistake of confusing the both have serious consequences in life to comes. If a human lust, then lust is never satisfied. Rarely are we satisfied with what we have. As a malay saying goes, Lust is like drinking a salted water, you can only get thirstier. There will always be other prettier and younger Man/woman.  But if one to believe in love, than the best love is truly prescribed by the Prophet Muhammad as a love between two human because of Allah SWT, They meet for Allah SWT and They parted because of Allah SWT.  Peace The Musafir
