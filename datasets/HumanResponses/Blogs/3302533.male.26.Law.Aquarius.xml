						   The legal lesson of the day is when you might be, just completely hypothetically, smoking some mad reefer in your apartment building; DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR! Girl scouts selling cookies don't wear badges around their necks.  Next time you intend to exercise dominion and control over the consumption or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance keep these little lessons in mind.   If anyone ever tells you that lawyers are a leach on society, remember medical doctors, who are all about charging 157 dollar to look at papers. I've had enough of greedy-hearted doctors who are all about doing the minimal amount of work while hiding behind a wall of pathetic high-school educated nurses. Go run for school board you lousy bastards, and don't dare whine when one of your neglected patients turns around and sues you for every greey little penny that you have pinched from the pockets of those who have to rely of your signatures for the continuation of their lives. Burn in hell, you, scum!

						   Springfield is advertising for a "legal assistance" to assist with the procurement of forcible entry & detainer orders and debt collection against tenants. From hearing officer to a robber of residences. . . could it really be that I have sunk so low morally as to even consider applying for such a position? Can I make a career out of squeezing money out of the empty pockets of the negligently indigent? I always said that I could kick grandparents out of their homes if I were representing the intersts of my clients, but fortunately I have a contervailing desire to enjoy my work (Is it still too idealistic?).   The question isn't really whether I could do it, but whether I would like doing it. At the momement I am too interested in my job at SSK to leave. I am learning...maybe not as much as I could be learning, but learning all the same.

						   I spent a casual moment today contemplating what types of luxuries I desire in my life. This moment took place somewhere between Akin's Health&nbsp;Food Market and the Fresh Fish Market during a rainy&nbsp;Oklahoma City day. If given my druthers and sufficient capitalization I would&nbsp;breakfast upon the choicest organic delectables packaged in recycled wrappings from&nbsp;producers with labels&nbsp;reminiscent &nbsp;of Iowan and&nbsp;Wisconsin farms. I would&nbsp;arranged for&nbsp;my 100% cotton high fiber-count checkered and striped&nbsp;custom-tailored shirts &nbsp;to be delivered at work, to which I would bike or run to every morning, take a quick shower there, and then listen to NPR while I read the NY Times, and the Journal Record. I would take my coffee black from the local coffee micro-roastery through a reputable coffee service. My L-shaped desk is cherry with a warm burgandy finish, tastfully covered with just enough papers to&nbsp;appear that there is plenty of work to be done.  It just occured that many of this posts might have spelling errors. . . . Oh, well.

						   Already the 26th and I haven't made an update. It is too easy to be lazy and distracted with things in this life. I have no good reasons not to be more product except that I believe that I lack sufficient incentive. Mostly what I am working for the moment is personal satisfaction. However, I find that I can be very satisfied with doing nothing and playing flashteroids than with improving my knowledge of the scientific validity of the SFSTs. Oh, well.  I have been very distracted lately with the prospect of starting my own pratice after I finish lawschool. By suggestion I have been reading a book on this subject. It has been very detailed and touched on what does seem to be essetial. Again I am taking much on faith and my experience with house renovation has certainly taught me that there is much unexpected in life.  I am still greatly impressed by the idea of being my own boss and seeing directly what I can earn for myself. Why work hard to make someone else rich. I want it for myself!

						    3 movies for only $21.99 a month sounds like a deal that we just can't pass up. However, there is still a little raising of my hackles when I think that I am contributing to the demise of local business. But then again how can I sympathize too much when this so-called local business does not play an active role in the communtiy. They operate with the same blood-thirsty profit-motivated manner as the outside predators, but have the benfiit of local real estate ownership. Ack, is there really a good choice? Is there anything that is truly local?

						   Imagine this! A few hours before dark a cattle truck upturns in a serious accident with a parked car. Oklahoma Highway Patrol responds to the scene. Upon his arrival, the officer discovers cows milling about the road. In the interest of expediancy the officer shooes the cows from the road so he can attend to the victims. Advance several hours later, the patrolman has left, but the cows are still at large. Able Driver moves at a brisk pace down a state highway, when suddenly he slams into several cows on the road way killing them. He is dazed, but aware enough that his car is nonfunctional and he has left debris in the roadway. He gets out and starts waving down other cars. He needs a cell phone and some help. Bosun Driver stops at the scene and hears Able's cries for help. He exists the vehicle and begins walking toward Able. Suddenly Careless Driver jets on to the scene, slamming into a dead cow carcass, and flipping through the air, clipping Bosun Driver on the leg and crashing into the side of Bosun's car.   Who is liable for what? Discuss.

						   Soon in the great state of Oklahoma it shall be written that:  It is unlawful and punishable as provided in this section for any person to drive, operate, or be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state,  whther upon public roads, highways, streets, turnpikes, other other public places or upon any private road, street, alley, or lane which provides access to one or more single or multi-family dwellings  , who: Has a Blood Alcohol content of over .08.  Jesus Christ, they will have anyone who might be carrying his keys while drinking a beer in his own driveway locked up for DUI!   Any system that will find that a person is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated when he is boning his girlfriend of two years in the front seat with his keys on the floorboard is capable of anything.  Soon they will throw out the board of test rules and they'll be checking people's break with that gaget for the Sharper Image.

						   Nothing more embarassing than calling someone's mother, looking for that person as an attorney and finding out that that person is in jail. Thanks for the heads up people.

						   In the matter of  United States v. Santana , 427 U.S. 947 (1976), the Supreme Court Decided that an arrest initiated in a public space allowed police officers to pursue the suspect into her own home as part of the "hot pursuit" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. Furthermore it clarified that the doorstep was considered a public place because of the person's reduced expectation of privacy.  The moral of the story is to never give the police probable cause to believe that you have committed a felony otherwise they are liable to chase you into you own home, break down your door, and arrest you with impunity.
