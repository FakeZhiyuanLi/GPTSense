      Okay..for some reason...today ALL of my freakin mesquito(dunno how to spell that) bites all itch at the same time and ya know I only have 2 hands and 10 fingers.  I can't scratch them all at once.  I can't use my feet cuz most of the bites are on my legs and I don't know about you but my legs just don't bend that way.  So yeah for everyones future refrence...put bug spray on when your outside.  Why do mesquito bites itch anywayz?  I never have really understood that.  And is it like poision ivy you have to be allergic to it to break out or what?  People...help me out here!  I really love it when you slap one that's sucking your blood and when you slap it, it explodes.  That is the coolest thing ever.  I mean if I slapped everyone as much as I do and we all exploded I don't think there would be anyone left on this planet.  Except me of course.  Because I'm Mighty Micki and the one doing all the slapping duh.  I'm not sure if I would be able to slap Super Maida because he's a super hero too. Actually he's the one who started all of this.  That crazy kid.  But we all still love NICK ANN MAIDA (it's actually David but I've called him Ann since before I can remember)

      Blake T. Daly has decided that he is going to try and make me believe that words graduate.  Like puncture(or however you spell that) instead of poke. He says that puncture is a better word cuz it somehow graduated from college and poke is just outta kindergarden.  Yeah I just don't understand...and he tried to explain his Dookie thing...don't get that one either. How does Dukes of Hazard tie into Dookie...I just don't get it!

      Ok everyone...this may make me sound like a baby but it really hurts. So last night I had a softball game...right? Yeah well... the ball was pitched way inside, yet I still swung at it. How dumb am I? Ok so yeah I swung at that stupid inside ball and you'll never guess what happened? DUH...I HIT IT OVER THE FENCE!!!!...yeah right...like that'll ever happen.  But yeah instead it hit my finger.  Do you know how bad that hurts? Worst of all it made underneath my wart bleed like a blood blister.  I couldn't feel my finger so I bit it so the blood would come out right? Yeah that was another bad idea. Hurt like a freakin mofo. And above all of that some jackass sitting on the other teams side decides to yell "Oh come on we don't have all day" Man if I wouldn't have been hurt I think I would have gone over and knocked that guy a good one...I hate inconciderate bastards. But WORST OF ALL...I think my fingers infected now cuz it has a red circle around it... my mom seems to think I should go to the doctor but like any other scared lil kid I said NO! Docs are scary!
