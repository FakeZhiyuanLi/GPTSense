        Mood-  Sad yet Excited   Current Music-  Leaving on a jet plane-John Denver    Leaving On A Jet Plane-John Denver     All my bags are packed,  I'm ready to go,  I'm standing here outside your door,  I hate to wake you up to say good-bye.  But the dawn is breaking,  it's early morn,  the taxi's waiting,  He's blowing his horn. Already I'm so lonesome I could die.  So kiss me and smile for me,  tell me that you'll wait for me,  hold me like you'll never let me go. 'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane,  don't know when I'll be back again.  Oh, babe, I hate to go.   There's so many times I've let you down, so many times I've played around,  I tell you now they don't mean a thing.  Every place I go I'll think of you,  every song I sing I'll sing for you,  when I come back,  I'll bring your wedding ring.  So kiss me and smile for me,  tell me that you'll wait for me,  hold me like you'll never let me go.  'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane,  don't know when I'll be back again.  Oh, babe, I hate to go.   Now the time has come to leave you,  one more time let me kiss you,  then close your eyes,  I'll be on my way.  Dream about the days to come when I won't have to leave alone,  about the times I won't have to say:  kiss me and smile for me,  tell me that you'll wait for me,  hold me like you'll never let me go.  'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane,  don't know when I'll be back again.  Oh, babe, I hate to go.  I'm leaving on a jet plane,  don't know when I'll be back again.  Oh, babe, I hate to go.    Just updating to say bye to all my loved ones.Am really going to miss them all.Tomorrow onwards life's gonna change and get back into routine within a couple of day.Lots of new things gonna happen.Am just hoping there would be some good news for me and i will get my room.Am praying hard.Even though I have new matrons to deal with and 5 New girls in my dorm to handle yet i'n just hating to go back.I dont know why!But anyways i'll soon be ok and kicking.Dont really know when i'll get the chance to update next but all you people reading my blog do keep checking it once in a blue moon as i will try my best to ubdate as often as i can,Thats about.Just wanna thank everyone for all that i have said and done for me.And just pray that god takes care of everyone.All the best to all and god bless.

        Mood-  Deep in thought!   Current Music-  Every Breath You Take-The police    EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE-The Police   Every breath you take  And every move you make  Every bond you break, every step you take  I'll be watching you    Every single day  And every word you say  Every game you play, every night you stay  I'll be watching you    Oh, can't you see  You belong to me?  How my poor heart aches   With every step you take  Every move you make  Every vow you break  Every smile you fake, every claim you stake  I'll be watching you    Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace  I dream at night, I can only see your face  I look around, but it's you I can't replace  I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace  I keep crying baby, baby please,   Oh, can't you see  You belong to me?  How my poor heart aches   With every step you take  Every move you make  Every vow you break  Every smile you fake, every claim you stake  I'll be watching you  Every move you make, every step you take  I'll be watching you  I'll be watching you   Listening to this song and just lost in my world of thoughts.Its just one of those days when am feeling extremely low and hiding it all behind a fake smile.I have learnt how to hide my emotions,though have not become perfect at the art but surely my face is not as transparent as it used to be!I always get feel kinda low the week before its time to get back to school but yet am kinda excited to go back.I dont know why this time its very different!I'm not enthusiastic at all.I dont even feel like shopping for school or thinking of what its gonna be like once i get back.Anyways my car incident has really upset me.Its costing 1 lakh bucks to get it repaired!God...though dad hasnt said anything but jokingly he's mentioned it to me thrice about how much its costing and stuff!Now that obviously just shows how upset he is!But now i jusr dont know how to make up for the hurt i have caused to dad.I'm just feeling so sorry about the whole thing.And now before i can even realise times just flying by and its just another 50hrs to go when i'll be on my way back to school!In simple words   I JUST DONT WANT TO GO BACK!  I have no option though but still...I dont know why am reluctant about accepting the fact that its time to part with so many things.But this time a changed AAHNA is going back to so lets just see how things work out.I'm just hoping not to be as miserable as i was in april!I just hated that term so much.But anyways am so sure though GOD seems to be really unhappy with me for only he knows what crime i have committed but life cant get worse than it was that month.And more than anything else i have surely become a tougher person!Today i just dont know what happened but after ages i felt weak inside.The smallest thing brought tears to my eyes.The fact that dad said he wasnt gonna come back home early made me cry.My voice was trembling when i requested him to be back early and the million other things just seemed to make me cry today!Why this is happening I really fail to understand but am just kinda accepting life as it comes.I kinda have started believing in destiny and fate.The stars will never change so whatever has to happen will happen.And I have become superstitious about things.I have never been this way in the past.I wonder whats going on!I just hope that it doesnt get worse.Thats about it for now its 3.45 and am just wondering where people are lost.I cant get any sleep as usual and just wondering what am i gonna do 2 nights from now when am gonna be stuck in CENTRAL JAIL(thats what we call school when it seems to suck)with no time pass to do.hehe...Probably will have to spend just a few more sleep less nights of my life!Used to it and am not asking for a change this time nor am i HOPING for anything miracle to happen.No expactations,No hopes,No dreams for my future.Everything seems to be so blank in front of me...

        Mood-  Crying   Current Music-  I'm sorry-Tyrese   I'm Sorry-Tyrese  1st: i'm sorry, yes i am for everything i've done wrong how can i do this right with you in my life even though i say i love you i've got to make a change in my life baby i realize you're better off without me on your side you're a special lady and i know i'm not ready for you  Chorus i'm sorry for what i've done i broke your heart now we're apart i'm sorry for making you cry i broke your heart now i'm alone  2nd tell me why i made my baby cry i know i love you but why should i put you through all of these changes never mind all those things i said 'cause i didn't mean a thing i promise you i only want you in my life  Chorus   3rd ooh it hurts to move on 'cause you're all i knew but i must stay strong i can't break down no more sometimes i sit and dream of you and me again ooh ooh ooh you have no idea how hurt i am that i ran away the one thing i shared meant the world to me  Chorus til fade    well...life just seemed like moving on the right track for a change and there things just did hav to screw up today.i guess god doesnt like me smiling for too long!the last 2 days seemed to be pretty ok n i was just hoping that finally as am abso over the past my life would change and i would start smiling a little more.but in some or the other way something has to happen to cause pain to me.The past 2 days something happened and i was just thanking god for everything he's given me.N the best gift all was that he made my DAD's daughter.I just wanted to do something good for dad before i left for skool coz no matter wht happens he's always tried to bring a smile on my face.This time for a change i wanted to make him smile.n there i bcum a reason to coz him another heart break.the things i treasure most are all getting screwed up.neways am just hating the fact that i have to go bak to skool n dad n i hav barely spent ne time together these holidays.and now just the perfect thing happened to cause me depression for the next couple of days.firstly yesterday my engineer finally turned up and said tht my pc was badly infected by virus.All my data and all other files music..everything went away.I dint bother much and dint try to giv it much attention though am madly in luv with my pc.But...as god saw that a small thing like tht wasnt solving his purpose to c me cry just another time so today he did something bigger.I was out all morning driving alone to do sum work for my frnd and her admission.I got back home was eating lunch and masi called.She wanted me to come with her to COTTONS to pick up suits for chins.I left the house and for a change took the driver along with me too though i was driving.i reached GK and missed the e-block turn went ahead took a U-TURN and returned.Then again i missed the gate to enter the block so i entered from the next gate and then took a right turn.there was no1 on the road and i was driving at a normal speed of 50-60 when suddenly from nowhere this maruti800 emerged n i dint even get a chance to use the breaks.There the car banged.Just 100metres away from masi's house.Now what was i to do.it was a major accident!the kid in the car was hurt n stuff.But was it my fault tht jerk should have watched out rite but bcoz mine was a bigger car and the kid was hurt all the blame came on m,e.My car,my most treasured possession was damaged badly.I'm so careful abt it tht even a small scratch hurts me and today the whole damn bumper the no. plate the indicator lite the bonut everything seems to be in a horrible shape.Ok even if i forget about the car and eventually dad would get the insurance claim for our car.But the damage will cost him good 30-40 thousand bucks.wow!! i hav neways spent enormously thru out my holidays and when i sat down n realised it i was just hating myself for doing that! and now there i coz more damage to dad.That man who loves me so much works in the office for 16-18 hrs a day just to see me happy and this is what i do to him.what a way to thank him rite!!! and on top of that the maruti chap said that we will hav to pay the whole damn cost for his repairs which would sum up to another 10000 bucks.Shit dude.what did i just do?and now the worst part is that though dad dint say nething to me in the fone n obviously i was crying and stuff while talking to him-one thing that he's made very clear to me is that now for a certain period of time I WOULDNT BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE!the only thing i loved doing and gave me a lil peace n relaxation has now been taken away from me.Life just seems to be so damn PERFECT rite now.The only conclusion i draw from all this is tht god doesnt like me being all happy.So next time i will keep a control over my emotions and not get to over joyed abt things as by the end of it all...all that comes to me is sadness!!!Just wanna say sorry to dad for hurting him so much.noway did i mean to coz pain to him in neway.Just dont know what to do!this may be one of my last updates for the next few months but lets see...if life carries on the way it is at the moment i will have no option but to break rules in skool and update as the only way i get a lil relieved is by writing abt my shit life!

I just wish each passing day was as perfect as each of the 50 thoughts above.The song and the thoughts just go hand in hand for me.Just 1 miracle can make my life as perfect as the thoghts above.Anyways i have been longing to blog since quite sometime now but i wonder why i hadnt done ot for quite some time now.Maybe i just was waiting for the right moment or was looking for something special to put on my 1st blog.But...I guess I couldnt really keep things inside me for so long.I had to put them somewhere.And have just got so used to blogging last few days that its more of an addiction now more than anything else.Anyways just a week more of this and then god knows when i would get a chance to update in school.  My trip to bombay was one of the trips i have ever had.As in though there was nothing really special apart from the fact that it was the last time i was seeing bits before she got married and it was the last time we were getting to spend so much time together maybe.So she did do her best to spend most of the time she could manage with and it did feel nice.Chins and i have always had great fun together so it wasnt any diff this time.She took me shopping all over and our choices are so similar that bits disliked whtever we chose so much and we just laughed it all.hehe...But anyways she was another naucturnal like ME and infact there were times when i failed to give her company to b up till whatever time she was.A few moments i spent in bombay were just so awesome.As in I just look back and I realise i hated the beach,I could never sit in silence,I never really saw the beauty nature possessed.But the two evenings spent at  BAND STAND  and then at  MARINE DRIVE were just so awesome.  25th JUNE(Friday),2004 11.00PM Taking a walk at Juhu beach.The breeze is blowing hard against my face.Bits Romit Chins Sonti and I just taking a walk and all of a sudden when chins romit and i go to have this kairi chaat.It simply rocked!So many memories attached to this place apart from just the yummy pao bhaji.The last time i came here was with DB,Bits.Chins,Sameer Pulkit,Dolly.That trip to bbay was so awesome.Bits DB a few others and I would come to Juhu every single evening and buy gas balloons,tie them all to an empty coke can and just let them loose.I used to be so fascinated by the site as a kid.And Db like a sweet bro would do it each evening just to see me smile.hehe...  This is one thing i always wanna keep a track of-26th JUNE(saturday),2004 7.50PM Today exact....actually just forget it i dont even wanna mention about the person or whteva!The situation was just so  IRONIC .I always thought of sitting at band stand ________ and sitting there for hours together(Bits u know what am talking abt!).________.Today I am finally sitting at Band stand _____-with one of our all time favourites "Tu Aashiqui Hai" playing!The breeze blowing hard agaisnt my face,the sun has almost set and the waves crashing hard against the shore.The sound created by the waves seems so soothing to the ear.What could be better?All old memories come Flooding back just as the waves rushing towards the shore.I want to shed a tear or two but i just hide it all behind a fake laugh.I'm lost in my own world of thoughts.Only if I had _______.It is the most awesome feeling one can ever have.All am asking god for is not to let this moment pass.Just the perfect moment which am trying to hold onto though time is just slipping out of my hands.I just capture the moment in my camera and the memory of this moment wil stay in my heart forever.I just dint know that one could ever feel this way without feeling the need of a companion to share the same feelings.I could just feel something beautiful around me.I just experienced something i have never done before and though the feeling i cant express in words... IT WAS JUST SIMPLY AWESOME! (the blanks(_______)are just few things i dnt wanna recall,i had it store as a note on my phone so just editted it and put it on)  The next day a similar incident takes place.27th JUNE(Sunday),2004 8.00PM I'm sitting at  MARINE DRIVE  with again 1 of my favourites songs  "BHEEGEY HONTH"  playing as soon as i put on FM.Wow!It just feels so good.The feeling just cant be expressed in words.As a smile at times can say much more than a laughter the same way the feeling can not be put down in words it just something which can be felt by the heart!It just made me realise that how nature could just over whelm you by just giving you the perfect moments.This trip to bombay has changed me tremendously.It seems the old aahna has sunk sumwhere down the deep blue sea and all those past memories just dont exist any longer.It feels so much nicer!  Probably thats the reason why i dint want this to end.But ya the change though is there but not a complete change.Maybe thats the reason I wanted a little more time out of this same old place(delhi) to get it all out of my mind.Maybe thats the reason on the last night I was just thinking about stuff and on that day maybe i just wasnt able to hide my emotions.Bits chins could both see it on my face(i have a very transparent face) and kept asking me what was wrong.But what was i to be saying?Coz i myself dint know what was wrong.I myself dint know what thoughts had taken over my mind.Maybe now i know what they were.But yet not sure.Sometimes its so wierd that you just cant figure out about your own life and things just feel so strange.You become a stranger to your own self!  Anyways I can go on writing forever.Maybe i surely can express much better by writing than i can when am talking.Its difficult for people to understand me.And i know i gotto improve my communication skills as i always cant be writing and expressing.As thats what a close friend complains of that i never talk.Now i just dont know what to say to some one who doesnt belong to MAYO.Its so sick.I gotto change this in me.Anyways i have started staying so quiet.I dont understand why.I never was this way.I dont know if others have noticed but I have.I'm hardly able to make conversation with my parents forget any one else.Probably the only one I can express everything is to rasna coz she's aware of everything that goes on in skool as well as at home.But i know the same thing's gonna happen again.Once we get back to skool Rasna n i wont be talking for another %months.And i hate that to happen but it always does happen that rasna n I though best of pals but yet we hardly communicate in skool.We talk much more at home.I am hoping there would be a change this time as things have changed.Though now as days are coming closer i dont feel like going back.I dont know am feeling damn low about going back to skool.Its something that different than the usual feeling i have before going back.I always do feel low but this time there is something more to it and am unable to figure out what it is.  Anyways am supposed to be going to dubai for a three day trip.But for now due to whatever reasons the plan has almost been called off.And am just hating the whole thing.Specially the reason is just pissing off.Its not even something genuine.But i cant do jack about it.I thought of going to chandigarh to meet diya incase i wasnt able to make it to Dubai but cant even do that.So guess gonna be home.But its a nice satisfying feeling altogether to be home.  hm..thats about it.God knows what all i have written.Still have so much to say but gotto put an end na.Probably just wanna thank each one who cares for me and understands me and wanna thank god for another beautiful morning.The sun rise was so beautiful this morn but it might hav just looked better if I was still in bbay.hehe...Next time...Which aint too far just abt 5 more months and then i'll be in bbay again and this time DB is gonna be there.Wow meeting him after ages!Though this time we wouldnt go to juhu and buy balloons but this time's gonna be surely better as we gonna hav so much fun as finally bits n him are tying the knot.Wow!!!  Ciao...I better get going before this blog never ends and Mum and Dad to wake up finding me all crazy being up so all night!hehe....
