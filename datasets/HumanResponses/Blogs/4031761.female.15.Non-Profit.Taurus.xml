      Just so y'all know, I'm sorry for not posting but I had been on a 24hr shift (I think you knew, but oh well...), so I wasn't able to post. We were swamped with calls... one after another, all day. A good trauma too, but I'll explain later. Well, y'all have a nice day!    Dont drink and Drive!!!!!    -Jay

      Well come to find out Dunwell was the chief,&nbsp;I was just looking at the wrong Fairview fire dept. Wierd. Anywho, today was  awesome . We didn't get to run any calls (and I'm going back next tuesday!) but I did get to ride in the engine for a good while. We ate at Jersey Mike's, watched a softball game, and sat around and talked. Everyone up there is really cool and I wouldn't mind working with them sometime. I'm still trying to decide what dept. to go on. It'll be either Cary, Raleigh, or Fairview. Probably Cary. I dunno yet. But yeah, I had alot of fun. It's pretty cool how the engines are set up. They have closed-circuit headsets so everyone in the cab can hear each other over the tremendous roar of the diesel engine (We sound like pilots when we talk... sooo cool!).&nbsp; But yeah, I'm in love with the fire service once more! Oh yeah, I won the pager on eBay, so I gotta get it re-toned/re-crytalled (By G.A. Henry). I won it for $56... charger and pager (Minitor II). Not too shabby. Well, I gotta go back to studying! So I'll catch y'all later!   The Brotherhood lives again,  - Jay

      Well tommorow I'm gonna hang out with the chief from Fairview... hehehe. AWEOME. I dunno what to do, say, wear... I'm so nervous. Wait, why am I nervous? Ughh, I dunno, but I just am. So the deal is that my aunt knows my neighbor pretty well (I haven't&nbsp;talked to her for a year or so), and her brother is the fire chief at Fairview. Or so I was told. But the last names don't match. The chiefs name is DeWayne Presley... and that's not her brother. Anywho, why do I care? I still get to hang out with the chief! OK, so I gotta get up early in the morning so I'm off to bed, but I figured I should write. Write to yall tommorow!!!   God Speed , -Jay

      Well, I've got a few days off... ugh. I hate the down time. Whether it is the time between calls, which can be a few minutes or hours, or my time off. The way we work is in shifts. One shift a week basically (For the volunteers and cadets) and the full-timers sign up and come in on their duty days AND the days they sign up for. So cadets are only at the station once a week. But no, not me, I'm up there atleast two or three times a week... I'm trying to start going every other day, but given my life schedule it's pretty tough. So yeah, I've got a lot of down time to work with. Usually I spend it studying for my tests, watching re-runs of 'Paramedics' and 'The Critical Hour', talking to my 'EMS buddies', stuff like that. I'm always doing something to remind me of being at the station. In fact, I almost everytime I leave the house I've got my scanner on me and tuned to Johnston County EMS Dispatch so I always know what's going on. In fact, I'm trying to get a Minitor II pager right now off of ebay for like $20 (reg. $200+). But I've gotta get a crystal and two tone filters ($50+xx... 2 filters are $50, and I'm still asking around about the crystal). But I figured that It'll be like a smaller version of my scanner, and it beeps  extremely  loud when we get a call... so I can use it at the station, instead of using one of the base pagers (You have to share  one  pager, so I'd like my own), and I'll keep it on me 24/7 so when they get a call and I'm out near the scene I can drop by to help. OK, well I gotta go now. Hope I didn't bore you to much.&nbsp; Ciao  to all my brothers out there!   &nbsp;   Lights and Sirens... I'll be there.    -Jay

      OK, well I guess I should start explaining things, huh?   I have to admit, at first I really didn't see myself entering EMS... ever. Yeah, I thought about being a doctor, or maybe a RN (but wiping the butt of a mature adult male... no, not my thing.), but EMS kind of suprised me. It all started when I got interested in  actually  storm chasing. I'd thought and dreamed about it millions of times, but never did take myself seriously. Sure, I knew I would eventually, but not this early. So I started trying to found a 'volunteer' storm chasing organisation for central North Carolina about a year ago. I met a guy&nbsp;that was interested in doing the same thing&nbsp;(He was 17 at the time), and we started talking about&nbsp;starting up a new organisation. So after MANY name changes, and talks with my good friend Brian Vocannon (NCSC-Team One), I took control of team two. So the "North Carolina Storm Chasers-Team Two" was born! Anywho, the guy I met was a volunteer firefighter at a station near my home, and he kind of intrigued me. We talked about how the system works, what he did... everything. I was hooked. I started looking into full-time, paid firefighting jobs in NC. I checked with Raleigh, Cary, everywhere, and I was pretty sure about doing it as a career. But for some reason, it just didn't feel right. I talked with my mom about it, and since she was (and still is)&nbsp;really into medicine, I started thinking about a medical field (So she was my 'push' for EMS... for MANY reasons.). Now, being the spontaneous guy I am, being a doctor just wouldn't cut it. I mean yeah, there's spontanaeity, but it just wasn't it... it wasn't enough. I love to drive... to travel. So I started to piece all of these things together. Let's see... medical, driving, spontaneity... hmm, what about EMS? And so it was, a future Paramedic was born! Every day, I eat, talk, and sleep EMS. No matter what I'm doing, it's on my mind. It's unbelievable. I just can't go a day without it. It doesn't feel like a job to me. It's almost like a hobby. I feel free when I'm at the station, or in the truck, but when I'm at home... I yearn to be with my baby... EMS23. (My favorite rig... she's a beaut!) It's one of those deals where if I won the lottery, there's no way in hell I'd leave EMS! I'd just have to do it. I love helping people. It's my calling. Sure, the money sucks, and there's almost never a 'Thank You' or even a nod or wave... but I know I did my job, and all is well... mission accomplished. Every call I go on is different. Every chest pain, every difficulty breathing... they all are  very  different. It's weird how in the business I'm in, we step into peoples' live's for an hour or two... then step right back out of it. We might have changed their lives forever... never to see or hear of or from them again. But that's just part of the job. I've had a few calls where I know that once the patient is at the ER, they just won't make it through the night, or for another 24 hours. But that too, is just part of the job. Ask an EMT or Paramedic, and they'll tell you... life as a EMT/Paramedic is hard, stressfull, and even overwhelming at times... but it's the best job in the world and none of us could ever give it up.

      Well, short and sweet... I gotta be at a meeting in a few so I figured I'd write in here real quick. I'll tell you how it goes, and go over a few of my previous calls (last weekend)... stuff like that. Well, I'll write here later.  God Speed, Jay  &nbsp; PS: For those who are wondering... an EMT-C is a Cadet. It's not officialy a rating, but it is merely an unofficial one in my department. Just some FYI.

      I've been  really  busy getting back ready for school to start. I stated high-school today. It's  awesome . Plenty of hot chicks to mack on, lol. Yeah, the problem is that I feel like crap. I was stung by a yellow jacket over the weekend (Doing some yard work) and it got me  right on the bloody ankle!  Wow... pain. One word. Pain. It hurt. On a scale from one to ten... a 8 or 9. It didn't feel like an ordinary YJ though. It hurt 10x as much as usual. Now my whole right ankle is swollen beyond belief. I can feel the rear bone (the one that goes down into the heel) easily on my left foot but it's no where to be found on my right one. Anyway, about EMS. Sorry it's been so long since I posted but due to all the stuff going on right now, I just couldn't make time. But no EMS news. Only one minor MVA, single car roll-over. That's it. I forgot what the other call was that I was going to talk about in this post (Mentioned last time). Oh well. OK, well, I've got another busy day ahead tommorow w/ school and all.. then EMS later in the evening. I'll try to post again tommorow night. Well, peace guys.    Lights and Sirens,    -Jay
