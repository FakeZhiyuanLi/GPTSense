      Ok, today has been a very long day. I've never had an on-line journal but I'm going to give it a try. I have a lot of things to blog about and no where to go to let those rants out! LOL.... so I'll call this the test blog....... I used to journal, however, having to hide it to keep people from seeing it got to be difficult and I wasn't really in the mood to be 'spied' on.  I have an idea of how this thing works - it's just an electronic version of my journal - well a little about me and the major players in my life...... clue 1, I'm NOT  a linear thinker, so this could tend to be ALL OVER the place before my initial point is made LOL......:::: wink.... sorry in advance!  Me = RavenHoney/Michelle  I'm RavenHoney or Michelle. Sometimes I wish I could be someone else, someone more fun, more patient, more carefree and less uptight, with more money and less stress, a better job and more time for myself, someone who can wake-up at 6 am, refreshed and feeling like I've slept for 10 hours, when in reality it's been more like 5-hours -  Since this is supposed to be a personal thing about me and my life, I'll introduce myself, my family, friends and others...  Born on Halloween, in Richmond, Indiana - I lived there until I was 16, graduating early (nice way of saying got into enough trouble to get out early) from Job Corps, I followed my family to California. I've lived in California for almost 21 years now. To date I'm a 37 (almost 38) year old single mom of 3 grown kids. I had them early so I could keep up with them..::: smile.... Actually, numerous birth control methods failed me 3-times and I decided to raise my children as a young, single mother. I'm very glad that I did, I have ZERO regrets and love my children dearly. I wasn't always the best mother, and I learned as I went along. Each child was different and now they are all almost grown and gone. I never want to be divorced, and knowing that I hadn't met "Mr. Right" - I wasn't willing to settle for "Mr. Right-now" so I've remained single. I'm the Run-away Bride, I've been engaged several times, but I can't seem to make it to the alter. I bail and usually move to another town, although once I moved across the country - long story I'll get to eventually.  I have a boyfriend, his name is Jerry, and he's a year younger than I am. We met on hotornot.com and dated for a year. I lived in Bakersfield at the time and he lived at the coast, and still does. After a year of dating we moved in together, me to his house. His TINY house. It wasn't a good idea, and 10-months later I moved out.  He has a 5-year old daughter, Shay, she's been nicknamed "the terrorist child" because of the hell I've been through over her, with her daddy and my own kids. Trying to 'blend' families is NOT easy, especially when her mommy and daddy live to make each other miserable, and her daddy is in denial over the guilt he has about not spending every waking moment with his child, well... You'll get the picture.  Jerry and I have been together for almost 3-years and recently got engaged. I asked him to marry me on a radio talk show he loves. Now, I'm not so sure that was the best thing. I know I love him, and was recently reminded that "every relationship doesn't HAVE to end in marriage." (thank you sissylove) - We've been discussing a lot of things lately, one being that we have NOTHING in common other than sex. Great thing to have in common, however when it seems to be the ONLY thing, well - - I'm sensing trouble down the road. I love being in his company and sexually we are sizzling! We both have such wild sexual fetishes that the other one fills - it's very satisfying and the orgasms are, at times, mind blowing - but is it enough to sustain a relationship? I'm thinking no.  He really tried to be the man I want - sometimes it works and I'm just reallyyyyyyyyy getting into him, falling in love all over again and then something petty happens and FUCKS it all up! It's gotten to the point that him  JUST MENTIONING  he will have his daughter makes my stomach get all nervous, diarrhea, and nausea strike instantly! I really thought I'd be able to give her 13-years of my life, because I love him 'THAT' much, I'm starting to realize that as much as I ment it when I said it, it's also THAT impossible. His ex, her mommy, the attorney's, the counselors, the fighting faxes flying back and forth, a visitation schedule dictating our lives, 13 additional years of paying child support, his daughter squeezing in little rude comments and actions that he refuses to see, day care, kindergarden and junior high - all of this all over again, I seriously do not think I 'want' to do it. I'm past that stage of my life and am able to communicate in an adult way with my ex's - it's a shame and a pitty that he and his ex can't work together for the best interest of THEIR child - it's a SICK game they play and I get stuck dealing with it - oral surgery w/o pain would be more fun!  Sexually, well I like the extreme side of the 'lifestyle' - bondage, domination, choking, being flogged and whipped until I just want to cry and then pass out! He gives me what I want in 'that' area, and I, in turn, give him his 'control' fetish. I'm NOT a submissive person by any measure, but I am addicted to that pain-in, pleasure-out syndrome....:: freakish to some, normal to me!  I like to do the same ol' normal things that most women like, romance, flirting, bubble baths and the like, dinner in the candle light and soft kisses in front of the fire place, driving while singing country music at the top of my lungs, walking on the beach holding hands, making out, making out, and more making out. I love to be in the ocean! I just had my first run-in with a stingray, an emergency room trip, toe surgery, and several pain pills later, the prognosis is that I'll live, however my toe hasn't seemed quite able to accept that! It HURTS!!!!!!!!!!  Anyway, I'm finishing my BA in criminal justice (went back to college, again), a girlfriend for now, a mother forever and also gramma to a beautiful little 20 month old baby girl who belongs to my oldest daughter and my son-in-law. My kids are Brandi 17, Michael 20, and Steph will be 23 this year, and my son-in-law, Charlie, just turned 21. Stephanie and Charlie's daughter, my beautiful grandbaby is Katie, she will be 2 in December 2004. Sometimes that baby girl is the only thing that makes my day worth while.  I used to think my daughter was a good mother, however, recently I'm questioning that. She's doing a lot of crap around the baby that really upsets me, smoking is on the top of the list! Back in the day (how's that for HIP mom talk LOL) she used to be very protective of Katie, and now it seems that she's more bothered by her than anything. She was a good 'mommy' for the first year, and now it's like she's irritated by Katie. It hurts me to see her cry or hear her crying while I'm on the phone with Steph. She is so impatient with Katie, and too often.
