      Today I had an orthodontist appointment at 11:45. I got some more things in my mouth. Then I went to Katie's house for her birthday party. I'm not saying it was boring, but I've been to better parties. We played nuke 'em and talked to people. After that I passed by Ashwin's and left because I wasn't wanted. LOL. I went home and a couple hours later I got a call from Ashwin. Guess what? I'm wanted. LOL. Anyways Matt and Vinayak were having a dunk contest and Vinayak won. After that me and Ashwin had 1 then Matt and Vinayak then me and Ashwin again. Ashwin kept winning cuz I tried crazy dunks. Vinayak left and we won't see him for about a month :'(. LOL. We then went to Brian C's to play nuke 'em. What a fun kid he is. Me, Matt, and Ashwin then left and Matt and Ashwin went to talk to Vinayak and I went home. I had a good dinner then went upstairs to watch Phil of The Future. I am now on the computer and trying to recover files cuz I had to system recover.

      Today was the average Kevin Talati day. I went to Ashwin's house to play basketball with him, Vinayak, and Matt. Adam K. came later with Michael F. He was supposed to have brought Sam but he didn't. We played for a little while: Me, Matt, and Adam VS. Vinayak, Ashwin, and Mike. Mike left later because he sucked like usual. We played a little more and lost the series. We went in to play Halo. As we were walking in, my sister called telling me to come home within 10 minutes. I was going to leave Ashwin's in five but I lost track of time. Adam later said, "Kevin, weren't you supposed to leave like 15 minutes ago?" And I said, "O SHOOT!" and I ran faster than ever. I reached home and left for my eye doctor appointment. I am going to get contacts, so get used to it. Anyways I came home went on the computer then Ashwin came. We hung out in my room for 5 minutes then went to Matt's. Me, Sam, Matt, and Ashwin were just shooting around for 30 minutes then we called "CJ"(don't ask.) So anyways I had a fun day.

      Today I went to Summer Band Camp and had fun. I don't know why, but I laughed a lot today. Anyways, after that I went to Ashwin's. We were playing Halo and playing basketball. It was me, Vinayak, Ashwin, Adam K., and Matt. We played basketball with Adam but then he left and we played Halo without him. We were doing the same thing we did yesterday when playing Halo(the thing with getting the ghosts in the fort). Except today I was trying to get them out instead of in. Matt was being cheap in a tank. Ashwin was yelling his usual "BICKA" while Vinayak said funnier things that Ashwin will steal sometime. After Halo me, Matt, and Vinayak made fun of Ashwin a lot because of something we found in his house. Matt was really funny and Ashwin's sister got mad because of the loudness of my laugh. Ask me later about this incident. I don't want to write it all out. Anyways, then we played basketball again and discussed more on this topic. I went home after a while. I was trying to find a cool laptop that was cheap...no luck. Then I went to the park with Ashwin and Matt and watched Ben, John, Adam, Kyle, and Chris blow things up. I came back home and tried finding a laptop again...I got luckier and now I am listening to "I Like That" and my cousin  trying  to play guitar. Now...to find that laptop...

      Today I went to Ashwin's to play Halo with him and Vinayak. We played for a while and instead of trying to kill each other like we're supposed to, me and Ashwin were trying to get the ghosts in the fort. LOL. Some of you may not understand that. Anyways, Vinayak was trying to get them back out. Ashwin betrayed our partnership a lot and I tried to get him back. After some time we stopped playing and then Sam came. We just threw stuff and played ping pong until my ingenius idea of ordering pizza. We went back to my house and had pizza. Sam brought Kill Bill Vol. 1 for our entertainment. I didn't find it fun until the Japanese gang scene. LOL. Anyways then I came home. I think Ashwin and Vinayak went to Ashwin's house t play bball but I stayed. I just played guitar, practiced trombone, and here I am on the computer. I will probably work on some AIM profile. I should probably work on my website. I will...LOL.

      In da morning(which is a song) we gave our dad the usual father's day gift, which Ashwin doesn't celebrate. Anyways we gave him a cool laptop bag then everything else happened.  Today me and Ashwin kicked it with the big people in da neighborhood. First I went to Ashwin's to play bball with him, Vinayak, and Kevin L. Then Kevin L. left and Vinayak, Ashwin, and I went back to my house to eat corn, hot dogs, and BBQ chicken. Adam and Kyle showed up so we played badminton, nuke 'em, and volleyball with them. Kyle left eventually then everyone left. A few minutes after that I got invited to Vinayak's to play bball. I went but then everyone wanted to go to Ashwin's. We went. Ashwin's sister, Preeti, and her friends were there. Serene, Austin, George, and "Alan"(really Jeff) were there. We played 3 on 4 and Vinayak and the little kids won...then got bored...people shot around, I nearly flipped over on Adam's bike, and I showed off my cell phone. It was a fun day...I just got back home a couple minutes ago.

      Today was actually not a bad day. I didn't hang out with any of my friends at all. First I beat CTU: Marine Sharpshooter. I played Basketball with my cousin and sister, then went biking with my cousin. We went all around da neighborhood. Then me and my family went to the mall. We just went around the place. My sister and mom went to boring clothing and blah places while me and my dad went to see the old cell phones that America has. LOL, so typically us. We went to Gamestop and we were going to reserve Halo 2 but they only made reservations for XBox. Anyways I ate there, mmm mmm. I came home and played Ground Control II. I ate more, mmm mmm. Then watched Ek aur Ek Gyara, an Indian movie. After that I played Unreal Tournament 2004...The Demo and talked to Sam like I do every night.

      Last night I was suppose to call Viniyak to confirm we're playing cricket today. I remembered to call when it was like 10 and i didn't want to call to late. Today I remembered Matt couldn't play because he had baseball. I was going to go to the park and tell Viniyak that we weren't playing but I forgot to. Then he came to my house and got mad. We later went to the park to play cricket. It was OK, kinda boring with the one bounce rule and the non-cricket pitches. Well then we went to Ashwin's to play basketball. Joe and Sam went on a walk. We played for a while then decided to go to a movie. I went home, ate, and went to see Dodgeball. We saw Phil there and a lot of people from West Oak. I laughed a lot in that movie. It was hilarious.

      Today I used a spare phone my dad gave me. I didn't do much until about 1 when I went to Ashwin's. When I went there we went to Ashley's to talk to Neal and pet the dog. After that we went to Matt's and went back to Neal's and Phil came. We hung out for about 30 minutes then went back to Ashwin's to play BBall. Phil, Ashley, Ashwin, Matt, Krishna(some kid accross the street), and me were playing. Then I left and ate and got my phone that I usually use. After that I went out to search for Ashwin and I found him at Matt's with Skim. We played bball and negotiated with Adam to give Skim back his chromies. After that I went home and played with my phone. Like I said, Usual Day.

      Hey, This is the first time I'm posting in my blog. So yea, it's summer. Not too fun yet. So far I have played a lot of basketball with Ashwin, Vinayak, Sam, and Adam, Matt isn't available much now, hung out with people that we usually don't hang out with, summer band camp, and computer. I have a feeling it will get more fun over time. One thing that I found very surprising was that the Lakers lost last night. And what's even more odd? Chauncey Billups was MVP. What's up with that? Lakers should've won!

      So today I woke up at 10:00 AM. I went on the computer and had to deal with that spyware. Again. So I went online and talked to people on AIM. I talked to Nicole. I wished her a happy birthday. She told me she had gotten an Ashlee Simpson CD from her sister and she thought she was getting an iPod from her parents. So I talked and I thought "iPod". Just a week before I had learned of a Motorola/Apple partnership that would make an iPod cell phone. I didn't want to brag and say I would be getting that so I didn't. I took a shower and watched TV and went on the computer more. I got tired of that at about 3:00 and called Sam. We discussed our viewing of the movie  The Village  that would be taking place at 5:15. I told Sam to come to my house. He eventually came. Late as usual. We talked at my door for a couple minutes and decided to go back to Sam's house and play with his remote control boat. While I was waiting for Sam to get his boat, I called Ashwin confirming that he was coming. He said he couldn't. Anyways, we got to the pond. I made Sam put it in the water and I drove it first. Man, I'm nice. It was so slow. LoL. Sam told me no tot take it out into the middle because he never charged it and it could get stuck at anytime. Sam drove it next. Same speed. We got bored and went back to his house. My bike started making noises. *Sigh*. Same problem as before. Missing bearing on the back wheel. Stupid Wal-Mart. Anyways, we got to his house and went to the computer. I figured out how to use the audio and video thing on his movie making software. So now he can record. Sam has been working on many song's remixes over the past weeks. He would change: "Mmmm I like it like that, she workin' that back...." to "Ewwww! I hate it like that, she workin' that fat...." LoL. So we made music videos out of his remixes. It was funny! We made one for  On Fire ,  Slow Motion , and  Let's Get It Started . Yep, so Jigar called and told me to come home because we were leaving for  The Village . My sister was coming along. Me and Sam went to my house and got in the car. We went to pick up Matt. That was the whole party: me, Sam, Matt, Jigar, and my sister. Anyways, we got to the movies and I made Jigar buy me "Reeses Pieces." We also got popcorn. We went in and got seats in the back. We watched the movie. Dang, nothing like I expected. I don't want to ruin it but...save yourself (or your money in this case.) We went home. Along the way, we talked about M. Night Shyamalan. We talked about his role in the movie. Sam made fun of what would have happened if he had taken a major role in the movie. He made fun of Indian accents and stuff. Example: "I killed you, come again!" LoL. Funny kid. So we dropped them off and went home. It was just us 3 now, me, Jigar, and my sister. My parents had gone out for a movie so we went to get pizza. I kept criticizing Jigar's driving. LoL. It was funny. Anyways, Jigar wanted me and my sister to go get the pizza so I lectured him about making children work and how wrong it is. Then we went home and had our pizza while watching TV. Then Jigar looked for directions to  ColdStone Creamers (I think that's what it's called). Anyways, we went there. I criticized Jigar's driving some more. When we got there, there was a long line. We saw Chinese people in front of us. Jigar got kind of "mad" in a way. Actually he was just sick of seeing them. He's not racist. It's just that, we saw A LOT of Chinese people that day. LoL. I got Monkey Bites. It was like 100% banana ice cream. The ice cream was banana flavored and there were pieces of banana in it. The only thing that wasn't banana was the crunch bar. It was good. My sister didn't finish. Jigar told us a story about when he went to that place in Milwaukee with a girl. He worked for 7 hours in the cafeteria and made $21.15 and spent $22 for 2 ice creams that same night. LoL. We finished and came home. We saw more Oriental people. We got home and I tried to install Service Pack 1. It didn't work. My computer is now broken.....

      5:24 AM  "ZzZzZzZzZzZ." "Kevin, wake up!" I wake up and follow my dad downstairs. "Did you get in a fight with any of your friends get in a fight or anything?" "No." "Well look what they did." I look outside and I see toilet paper all over my trees. It was a pretty big mess. I went outside and checked it out. The first thing I noticed was there were chopsticks in the ground. WTF? Chopsticks? Anyways the next thing I noticed was that they had squirted ranch dressing on my driveway. Someone really likes food. I had my suspicions on who it was. I was thinking Adam K. No offense, Adam, but you do have a record for doing those types of things. LoL. Anyways, we called the cops and they came. He said it was just a prank and he was off in like 2 seconds. Yeah so we started cleaning up and stuff. We cleaned the ranch with the toilet paper. LoL. We got all the paper we could because my trees are high so we couldn't get all of it. We also pulled out the chopsticks. I still don't get that. Anyways, we went back in and my parents looked mad. I went to sleep again...  I woke up and went on the computer. I told Sam and Ashwin. My sister came and asked me why there was toilet paper on our front lawn. LoL. Anyways, then I brushed my teeth and stuff and went to eat breakfast. I ate and showered and everything I usually do and went on the computer again. I talked to people like Matt and Ashwin. I was going to eat lunch but then Matt IMed me and told me to go to his house. He also told me to bring Sam along if I could. I was on my way to Sam's and Matt calls me on my A1000 and tells me to come to the park. I went to Sam's and rang the doorbell. No answer. So I tried calling him. He said he was in the shower and said he would come to the baseball fields when he was ready. So I started for the park. Matt seemed mad at me. It was weird. Probably from yesterday. LoL. Anyways, I find out that we're playing football with DK(Matt's brother), Brian(DK's friend), Ashwin, Matt, Sam, and of course me. So we start playing without Sam. It was me, DK, Brian vs. Ashwin and Matt. We played tackle at first. Then we realized that we couldn't take people down and they would just run to touchdown. So we start playing 2 hand touch. We play for a while and then Sam comes along. We restarted. We were tied before we restarted. So now Sam was in. It was n even game now. We were winning early but then they came back. We played for a little while and then Michael J. joins us. He was added to our team. So now we had more people. It would be foreshadowed that we would win but luck wasn't with us. They continued to do well and we couldn't stop them. Then Michael F., Gary Z., and Kyle M. come and ask us to play. I eyed them funny because I suspected them of TPing my house. So we didn't let them play and Michael J. left us for them. LoL. We finished playing once we got bored. Everyone thought I did bad. I made a couple good interceptions. I dropped more than I usually would. I used to play football everyday at recess in 4th grade. I was a lot better then. Aging sucks man. JK LoL. Everyone went home for lunch. Me and Sam stuck together. We talked to Gary and his buds and they told us they didn't do it. They laughed a little and asked how hard it was to get the chopsticks out. Now I think...how would they know about the chopsticks? We removed them at 5:30 in the morning. I think I'll be interrogating tomorrow. LOL. Anyways back to my day. They told us Michael L. also got TPed. So me and Sam went to check it out. We saw Ashwin on our way. He was talking to Mike G. We saw Michael L.'s. Not a lot compared to mine. Kids these days man I'm telling you. LoL. Anyways, me and Sam went back to my house, got Gatorade, and I talked to my dad about phones. Sam sat there and drank Gatorade. I told Matt to come and so they did. The three of them sat there while I finished up with my cell phones. Then we went outside and played badminton. It was me and Matt vs Sam and Ashwin. We didn't really play. We were winning though. Then me and Sam went 1 on 1. I got bored real fast so Matt and Sam went 1 on 1. Then Sam said he could beat me so I versed him. LoL. I won, of course. Then we went to the park and asked DK, Jamal, and Brian if they wanted to do a basketball game. They accepted and so we went to Matt's to get a basketball. DK and his buds were driven back to Matt's but then we decided to play at the park so we all rode there. First it was me, Ashwin, Jamal, and Brian vs. Matt, DK, and Sam. They won 2 games with those teams. Then me and Sam went to my house to get Gatorades. I didn't have enough for anybody else. We went back and they had already started. Matt had enough Gatorades for everyone. LoL. Good old Matt. Anyways, the new teams were me, Ashwin, and DK vs. Matt, Sam, and Brian. *Sigh* We lost. Then we went back to Matt's house. Just me, Sam, Ashwin, and DK. We shot around and then Ashwin left. I don't know why. Matt says it was because of me. Anyways. Me and Sam played 1 on 1. Obviously I wanted to extend the game and so I didn't try that hard. We were playing to 11 but then I won and then we played until 21 and I won. Then we continued to 25. LoL. By now Sam was very tired. I wanted to extend the game a lot so I would take a lot of 2s at the end. I made it to 24 but I wanted to end it with a 2 so I asked the refs to take away a point from me. LoL. By the Matt and DK were commenting. Man talk about not fair. They were rooting for Sam. Matt just wanted to piss me off. LoL. Like he said in his  urlLink Xanga  he wanted payback. Oh well. I won. I could've won earlier but there was nothing else to do so I tried to extend it by taking 2s. LoL. Anyways, we finished that and I went home. I ate chicken fried rice and set up our new phones we got. My parents and my sister left for sometime so I just watched TV and stuff. Anyways, now I'm here writing probably my longest blog ever. LoL. Anyways, I'm out like a non-white in the presidential elections. LoL. I started these lines because Sam did. Great kid he is.  PS- The American Experience is getting TPed for no reason at all and playing football. LoL.

      Today I woke up around 10:30 and did nothing. I fixed my computer. It is kind of back to normal. They should make spyware illegal. ARGH! Anyways, so I took a shower and had a nice sandwich for lunch. Mmm mmm. With the Indian touch to it. That's some good stuff. Anyways, I called Sam and to,d him to come over to my house. So it took about 15-20 minutes for him to get there and then we looked at the new posters of cell phones I got in my room. Then we just talked in my garage until my laundry was done so I could get socks. That took maybe 10 more minutes. Sam told me that Ashwin told him to go to his house. So we went to his house. I had my handy dandy, awesome, slim, unbeatable Razr cell phone. Man that thing is soo cool I can't talk about it enough! LoL. Anyways, we got there and rung the doorbell. His dad told us to check the garage. It was open and we saw no bike so we started towards the park. We were riding past the baseball fields and then saw Ashwin, Ashley, Marissa, and Stephanie F. Ashwin didn't talk to us. Oh well that's Ashwin for you. Anyways, we talked to them for a little and they said they were going to Ashley's so we all separated and we went our ways. Me and Sam went to Sam's because it was probably more fun than whatever Ashwin was going to do. Yep, so we made a couple jumps on that little jump by the parking lot at the park. LoL. Love that thing. Anyways, we got to Sam's and watched  Full Metal Jacket&nbsp; from   where we had left off. It was a good movie. It was kind of unrealistic. People not ducking and stuff. The ending was also not that great. But overall, it was a good movie. So me and Sam then went back outside. We went back to Ashwin's to see what he was up to. We got there and rang the doorbell...no answer. Ashwin rode his bike out of the garage and looked at us. So we talked and stuff. We decided to go riding around. We ended up at Sam's house and we hung out there for a little while. Ashwin left to play tennis with this one really good tennis player. We just chilled a little and then Matt called. I told him to come over to Sam's house. Ashwin came back because the tennis kid had told him he was 5 minutes late and he had found somebody else to play with. LoL. Anyways, then Matt came shortly after Ashwin's arrival. We just chilled for a couple minutes and then we had to leave because Sam was getting picked up for work. HAHA Sam working. That's kind of cool though. Anyways, we then left and rode around. Ashwin had to get his racquet and then he went to play tennis with the good tennis guy. I went home and ate dinner. I had pizza and then I got a call fro Matt and he told me to come to Ashwin's in about 5 minutes. I got there and we were off. We played basketball. Matt says I was acting really weird.&nbsp;We saw&nbsp;some freshman girl that I don't know very well&nbsp;on our way and we talked to her for a few minutes. She was amazed by my cell phone. Then we&nbsp;continued to ride around&nbsp;and went to Matt's house. They told me how I have a horrible "social skills". WTF? Isn't social skills based on how you talk to people. He's the kid afraid of parents and like mumbles in the corner. And also, it was just that I said some things that he didn't want me to say. Yeah, oh well that comes from 2 kids who think that I'm an idiot. LoL. Anyways, we shot around at Matt's and got Gatorades. They told em more about how I had horrible "social skills". I then left around 8:55 and then talked to Matt online while I was writing the beginning of this entry. He wants me to give him an E398. Search it on EBay and look at the prices. Yeah...that's why I said no. He said cell phones were just metal. Oh well...then again that comes form a kid that thinks cell phones are just pieces of metal. Also just the other day he disses how I have so many "unnecessary" things on my cell phone. That kid makes me so mad sometimes. LoL. Why am I their friend? I don't know...don't ask me. Or is it because I don't have "social skills". I don't know...ask them...I bet they'll give you a very inaccurate judgment of me. Hehe. Anyways, I am just surfing now. I'm out like a fat kid running for 1st base. CYA!

      So today, I woke up at around 10:00...the usual. Anyways, I ate breakfast for once and watched TV and showered and stuff like that. I also went on the computer. I have a lot of spyware and stuff. So I tried to clean it all up. It didn't work. Everything was going really slow. So I was eating my lunch and then I get a call from Nicole's house. It was Liz. She was asking if we wanted to come over to play volleyball. I accepted and called Ashwin. He accepted. I then called Matt, he wasn't home. Me and Ashwin were in my house for a while because I was still eating. In that time I talked to Jigar about Motorola. Then we finally left 10 minutes late. We called Sam on our way then. I thought Sam must have work so I didn't call him earlier. So I called him and he said&nbsp;"OK". We got to his house and he said he had piano but he made a phone call&nbsp;so we hung out upstairs&nbsp;for a while. Then Matt called me and asked if we were doing anything. I said "yes". so he came to Sam's.&nbsp;We finally departed for Nicole's house. We got there 30 minutes late but that's OK. When we got there, we played volleyball with Liz and Nicole. I was with Liz and Nicole and we versed the amateurs. LOL. So we won and then we had drinks. I had Pepsi while Matt and Sam had Gatorade. Ashwin had nothing. I think he has long-lasting saliva or something. LOL. Anyways, Gina came and we called her names that weren't hers like "Joanne" and "Cheryl". So we got back to the game. Now it was girls verse boys. That was an odd game. No score keeping. Sam had to leave so then Matt and Ashwin left eventually also. I didn't go with them which was kind of odd. They were pissing me off so I didn't follow. So I continued to play volleyball. We played: me and Kummer vs. Nicole and Gina. We didn't really keep score then either. I think we won though because I'm just sooo good. Well I'm not bad. Anyways, we stopped and sat down to have ice cram. I had a Dilly Bar. LOL. It was good. We talked about stuff like names. It's odd talking to a group of girls. Oh well. It was fun. We also talked about stories about them all freaking out. They also talked about piercings and stuff. Liz and Gina were like jumping at each other arguing. LOL. So then time flew. I had been there for 2 hours. Then I left. I looked for Ashwin and Matt. They weren't at Ashwin's so I gave up. I'm so persistent. Oh well. Then I went back home and had salad for dinner. I got done and my dad gave me the Razr and A1000. I was playing with them and just when I got done switching my SIMs, Ashwin and Sam came over. They stepped in for a little bit while I cleaned up my phone mess. LOL. Anyways we rode around talking. We had no destination. Me and Sam argued a little. We rode around almost all of Grosse Pointe and also stopped at Mike. G.'s for a minute. We kept talking and stuff. We went into Brian Czosek's street. Ashwin drifted away from us and we eventually lost him. Oh well. So me and Sam continued to talk. We talked about professions. We saw Adam K., Mike F., and Vladi. I showed off my phone. LOL. It was great. Then Matt called but they pressed "ignore". So I called back and his dad told me to come over to shoot hoops.&nbsp;Me and Sam left and talked about college and got to Matt;s house. I went and shot around. Then we played Around The World. We never finished but me and Matt tied. Jeff came over. Danny, Matt's brother, came from the park. So we decided to play a game. We did so. It was me, Jeff, and DK(Danny) vs. Matt and Sam. They were beating us and then Sam had to leave. Then it was me and DK vs. Jeff and Matt. That was a good game. I stuffed Jeff once. He's tall though. I don't get it. LOL. Anyways, I then went back home when I saw the time. I came home, fixed my computer (kind of) and played with all of the phones. They're fun. Anyways, I think now I'm gonna play with my phone more. So cya.  I'm out like a fat kid's out for fast food.

      Today I woke up around 10:30. I was supposed to clean up my 1st floor before my mom got home. I was supposed to get all the spider webs and everything. Yeah, so I didn't have breakfast because there's no point if you wake up too late. Actually, I didn't wake up too late but I went on the computer until 12. Then I took a shower. I looked online and I saw that the  urlLink Razr V3  was announced today. That phone is the bomb! Anyways, I told all the people onion about it and I told Liz to call me if her and Nicole were doing anything later. I don't see the point of that due to the fact that I barely ever talk to Nicole. Sam came over when I was getting ready to eat. So I didn't eat. He was wearing his Frulatti Cafe uniform so I took a picture with my cell phone. Anyways, we went upstairs. We talked about the next phone I'm getting which is the  urlLink Razr V3 . We also traded Norton for Halo. He then had to leave for work. Then I ate and talked to Nicole and Liz on the phone. After I finished that, I got out the vacuum cleaner. As I was doing so, Ashwin and Matt rang my doorbell. They came in because I had to clean. They watched TV and stuff while I did my chores. Then we left and went to Liz's house. They were watching a movie. Nicole wanted to go back in because me and Matt were talking about cell phones. Ashwin and Matt thinks that she is mean to me because I like her but she still does not talk to me. Anyways, then we went back to my house. I called my mom to tell her that I had friends over. She told me we had to go outside. Anyways, we stayed inside for a while. I showed Matt the  urlLink Razr V3 . Then we went back downstairs and watched Streetball. I got bored so continued my chores that I had abandoned. Matt went into the dark Living Room and was acting real creepy. LOL. Anyways, we went outside. We went to Rajiv's house because Alex told us he was outside. We got him and we were about to shoot hoops when we asked him to play Halo with us. He had to ask his mom because she doesn't like him "wandering" around. He got the approval and we were on our way to Ashwin's Along the way, I made some  A Bug's Life  video game jokes. When we got inside, Rajiv introduced himself to Ashwin's dad by saying: "Hi! My name is Rajiv". I agree that this was the polite thing to do but come on, no one does this stuff anymore. It's just like: get in, chill, then get out. Parent contacts should kind of be on the low. I'm not making fun of this act, it's just not usual. Anyways, we played Halo. He didn't know the controls so we killed him. Anyways, I came in 3rd as usual. Rajiv had to leave because he was to be having guests at their home. Anyways, we rode around and then eventually went to the park. There we saw Michelle Wineman's (Winegard)  softball team. It was fun to cheer and scream "GO MICHELLE!" LOL. Anyways, we then went to Liz's house to test Ashwin and Matt's theory about not wanting to talk to me. No one was home so we went to the Wings. Nicole's mom told us that Nicole was not home, but Matt and Ashwin say that they saw Nicole and her dad on the computer. LOL. So anyways, we wet back to the park and continued to cheer. We also talked about the sins and guides in the Christian religion. Like I say, the more you know, the more smarter you are. LOL. Anyways, we saw Katie T., and Kelsey P. there. All four of them went on the swings but left me out and laughed. Man I have bad friends. LOL. We hung out there for a while. I sat on a bump on the center of the see-saw. LOL. Then me and Matt went home. Ashwin followed Matt home, I think. Well he went his direction. I got home and ate dinner. I talked to my dad about the announcement of the  urlLink Razr V3 . LOL. Ashwin called me to tell me to go to his house at 7:35. I agreed. Then I received another call telling me to go to Brian C's after dinner. I went. When I got there, I found Adam K., Matt, Ashwin, Michael F., and of course, Brian. We played capture the flag. Adam K. was spying. I was behind him helping. But he got up and ran back like and idiot. It's a thing called noise! Anyways, we played and we won once. Then Chandler and his sister came to play with us. They lived across the street from Brian. We played a long time, that game. They won. They put there ball in the gutter. Cheap! We put ours in the BBQ grill. At least you could reach it. Oh well. Different people have different opinions on this. We stopped playing and me, Matt, and Ashwin left. On our way back home, me and Matt talked about Motorola cell phones.  I don't get why he disses them so much. He says Nokia is the best. Oh well, whatever. I don't care what somebody that has no idea what he's talking about says. I got home and talked to my dad. He gave me the A1000. It still needs work. Then he gave me the  urlLink Razr V3 . It's awesome! It still needs final tune-up so he took it back. The only ting is that it doesn't have a Trans-Flash slot. LOL. Oh well, it's skinny as hell! Anyways, then I got rid of some stupid viruses on my computer and now I'm here talking to Sam about websites. OK, seeya!

      Today my mom woke me up at 10:08 because I had a physical. I got up and went to the computer. I stayed on until 10:30. I then went for a shower and I put on my contacts. Putting my contacts on took me a while. It was irritating. Yeah so I finished and had no time for breakfast and went right out the door. It took about 30 minutes to get there. When we got there, we waited a while and then I got my weight and height checked. Then we waited a little more. I went in and my doctor told me to pee in a cup. What's up with that? LOL. Then I waited outside a little more and went in and he did the rest of the exam. Then once my sister and I got done we went outside and waited for my mom to get done with her check up. I played with my cell phone while I waited. They needed to get her reports ready for her knee surgery so it took a while. Anyways when she was done we were ready to leave. As she was signing the forms at the front desk, my phone rang. Everyone looked at me because my ringtone is  I Like That . LOL. Anyways, it was Ashwin he asked where I was and he told me that I left my screen name on. It was on for 2 hours and 27 minutes. LOL. Anyways, we dropped by Burger King and got lunch. We went home and I checked my IMs. I had a lot. LOL. I had been on for 3 hours and 37 minutes and it didn't even go idle! LOL. Before I could eat, Matt, Ashwin, and Sam came over. They played  The Sims  while I ate. Sam was playing. LOL. He lost. Then we went outside and went to Liz Kummer's house but she wasn't home and so we went to Brian Czosek's. His mom said he was at Nick R's. So we went there and played 3 on 3 basketball with him and Brian. It was me, Matt, and Nick against Ashwin, Sam, and Matt. We won. Then we played Matt and Nick vs. all. They won that. Then we left and went. We went to the park and saw Liz and Nicole. We didn't talk to them. Then we went to Ashwin's. Matt's bike broke along the way so we fixed it at Ashwin's. It kind of helped. Almost the whole time, me and Sam were arguing about friction. LOL. We do that sometimes. HAHA. Anyways, while they were fixing it Adam came over to play basketball. The teams were me, Ashwin, and Adam vs. Matt and Sam. We won. Then we bought ice cream and Adam made me taste mine quickly so he could know if it tasted good or not. LOL. I dropped it in the rush. But I brushed off the grass and started eating again. Hey what can I say? 5 second rule. LOL. Anyways, then I went home and ate dinner. I was eating and Matt called. I told him to come to my house at 7:45. Then as I was walking up to my room, Sam called and I told him to come right then. They both came almost at the same time. Sam was right behind Matt. Matt was 9 minutes late. LOL. Anyways, we went to Ashwin's. We played Go Home. It was a good game. Then we talked with Nicole on my cell phone. I told her to be on at 9:15. Then I went home and talked to people online. I talked to Michelle Wineman. She told me to go to the pool with Danny so she could see my cell phone. Whatever. LOL. I also talked to Nicole and now I'm making her an AIM icon. Peace out.

      I have moved to  urlLink http://www.robocellkid.tk/ . We have done this because now I can have an ad-free blog! Thanks Sam for the FTP Access.   Today I woke up at about 9 because the 8 year old woke me up. He wanted to watch me play Halo. I haven't played for a while and I still need to install D3D 9.0b. It stinks without it. Anyways I kicked butt and went downstairs to have breakfast. We had donuts. Then me and Michael went downstairs to play N64. He played 1 player Zelda: Majora's Mask. I don't like watching people play but what the heck, it was like 5 minutes. Then they had to leave. My dad, mom, and sister went to drop them off. Now it was just me and Jigar. I just went on the computer and talked to people. Michelle Wineman told me she wanted to see my cell phone. LOL. I am going to go to her game Tuesday maybe. Anyways I also talked to Nicole. She told me that she was going to paint her bathroom. Then I was told by Ashwin to go to his house at 1:30. I went downstairs and didn't do much. I watched TV and played video games. Then I ate lunch I had leftover KFC. MMM MMM! Anyways I went upstairs and Ashwin told me not to come so then I told Matt to come to my house. He brought Ashwin with him. They wanted to talk to Jigar. LOL. Anyways then we went to Ashwin's house to play basketball and stuff. We went there and called Sam over. Then we called Brian over. First Brian came. We were on the computer. Just to see who was on and stuff. No on wes on really. Then, we went outside and shot around and then Sam came. Me and Brian versed 1 on 1. I won, of course. Then they wanted me to play a championship but I didn't want to. So I "forfeited" and Brian won. LOL. Brian better than me. Imagine that. HAHA. Anyways then they made me go 1 on 1 with Sam. I was up 1 to 0 and then I was like "OK I quit this is boring." So Now Brian and Sam are both better than me. LOL. Anyways then we played 2 on 3. Me and Matt vs. Ashwin, Sam, and Brian. I think we won. LOL. Matt kept yelling at me. Oh well. Then I got mad and asked why he was so mad. And then he was like "You talk too much and say 'just kidding' too much." LOL. OK whatever. Anyways then Ashwin and Sam went to get Halo. They got it and we went inside. Sam had to sit out while we played free for all. I came in last and had to give it up to Sam. I watched. Now Brian had to give it to me. Me and Sam traded controllers so I could have my mini. LOL. Anyways now I was on Ashwin's team and then we went outside to continue to play basketball. We shot around and didn't do much. We decided to go to Sam's house. We went there and no one was home. We went downstairs to box. I beat Brian and Matt and Sam easily creamed me. LOL. I don't know about Ashwin. I&nbsp;hit&nbsp;him&nbsp;in the beginning but he got really pissed at me and kept&nbsp;hitting me hard&nbsp;me. LOL. Oh well. Boxing doesn't hurt unless you're vs-ing Matt but that doesn't hurt. Anyways, Ashwin had to go so we went upstairs to the computer room. Brian played Hit and Run while we sat around and talked. Matt had to go now. Me and Sam put in&nbsp; Full   Metal Jacket  and watched it. Brian kept disturbing us. LOL. Anyways, Brian had to leave so we continued watching the movie. It was fun. LOL. The retarded guy shot himself. Anyways, then his parents came home so I left. I had dinner and I went to Sam's at 8:00. We went to Matt's to ask if he could do anything. It was his birthday so we kept saying "it's Mr. 13 Year Old." LOL. We shot around for about 2 minutes and played 2 on 2. It was me and Matt vs. Sam and Matt's brother. We won. LOL. Then we did me and Matt's brother vs. Matt and Sam. I think they won. Darn "13 year old." LOL. Anyways, we shot around talking. Sam kept saying stuff that he shouldn't have in front of Matt's brother. I did too but I made sure he didn't understand anything. LOL. Then Sam rode home with me and I went on the computer. I talked to Nicole for a little while. Anyways, now I'm blogging away like usual. These are too long for a little kid like me. LOL. Stay in school buddies!

      Today I got back from Matt's. I got home and took a shower and stuff. I had a bagel for lunch. Anyways, I was cleaning up a lot because my dad's 2 friends and their families were coming over.&nbsp;I was bored at 4:30 so I called Ashwin and he wasn't home. I called Matt and according to his mom "he was zapped." LOL. Ashwin called back and I went to his house. Sam called and we went to his. We all rode around doing nothing until we decided to play Shark (or Hot Lava Tag) at the park. We stopped when these other people came. Their dad was playing on the jungle gym so we kind of got "weirded out." LOL.&nbsp;There was Tim and Al. Tim has a little girl that my sister hung out with and a little boy that's 8 years old that I am hanging out with. So when they came we played badminton. It was me and Tim vs. Jigar and my sister, Jessica. Anyways I think we won but weweren't even playing correctly. We stopped playing when Jess tripped over the net cords and brought it down. LOL. Anyways I grabbed a coke and sat down with them. Then me and Jigar pput up the net again for no reason. After we put it up, me and Michael, the 8 year old kid, went downstairs to play video games. He really likes video games. LOL. Anyways my sister played ping pong with that 1 girl and another girl that was there. Me and Michael had a fun time playing video games. He didn't want to play 2 player and I didn't like that. LOL. Anyways then we went upstairs for dinner. We had tandori chicken, chicken biryani, and KFC chicken. LOL. Anyways, I ate but Michael finished first and whined about wanting to go play video games. LOL. He was very impatient. So after I finished, we went downstairs and continued a little Tony Hawk. He was willing to play 2 player. I whooped. LOL. Then we played Nightfire. WOW! I owned there 2. LOL. I had to go to the bathroom and he kept shooting me. As Matt would say "cheap kill!" LOL. Anyways I came back down and we decided to go old school and play N64. We played Perfect Dark. We were on a team. We won thanks to me. LOL. So anyways we went upstairs and watched a little TV with the other children. LOL. Everyone was leaving now. Michael begged his dad to stay. They accepted. After hearing the news of him staying, his sister decided to stay also. Me and Michael went upstairs and we watched the Halo 2 E3 Movie. It was cool like always. I played Halo and he watched a little. He laid down on my bed and went to sleep. My sister and that girl, Lauren, are now watching Freaky Friday and Daddy Day Care in the basement. Yep, great day.

      I got to Matt's house at 6:39. I was just 9 minutes late. I was the first one there. Me and Matt set up profiles for Halo so we could all play later. We just planned about where we should slee and what we should do until Ashwin came at about 7. When he came we played Halo with the 3 of us.&nbsp;I was doing quite well, tying with Ashwin until the end where he finally took 2nd place. Sam would be there soon. He said he would be a little late becuase he got a job at&nbsp;hi dad's&nbsp;Frulatti. We decided to go shoot hoops while it was still nice and light out. So we went outside and shot around. Then we started playing 21. Sam came when we were just in the beginning. We told him to just join in. He did. I was doing good for myself. I didn't let anyone tip anyone else except once to Ashwin. It was a mistake I was really tired. LOL. Anyways Sam was doing well also. I wasn't wearing glasses and Sam's "bubble was boiling" because he was the only one with glasses. LOL. Anyways I think Matt won and then we went inside. We played Halo. Ashwin created his own profile and we had already made Sam's. We played free for all and I came in 3rd as usual. Then we did teams and Matt and Ashwin beat me and Sam although we were close in the beginning.&nbsp; Then we all took a break and Matt and Ashwin went on the computer and me and SAm played 1 on 1 Halo. It is fun playing Halo there due to the fact that Matt's TV is BIG. Then we decided to take a bathroom break. We then put on  Scary Movie . People would think this movie is scary. It actually isn't. It is  really &nbsp;funny! LOL. Anyways there were a lot of funny parts such as the afro ;), Shorty the crackhead, and Doofy, the retarded killer. LOL. Anyways we watched that and took another bathroom break. Ashwin flooded the toilet, although it was not his fault (so we think). So we didn't use the downstairs toilet anymore. Me and Sam used the upstairs one and came back down. We then watched  Scary Movie 2 . Matt's mom was upstairs so we were allowed to laugh a little louder at immature scenes. I liked the first one more because it was much funnier. LOL. But the second was still funny. Anyways we watched all those and it was about 1 o' clock and when we went upstairs. We watched  Seven . It is more of a freaky movie than a scary movie. It had a lot of disturbing images where people died in unusual ways. The killer was really smart yet stupid. Brad Pitt lived in a house that shook because of the subway system. It was a good movie. Anyways, that ended at about 3 o' clock and we were all getting sleepy. We put in  Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me . We watched until the beginnning credits. I remember falling asleep, Ashwin told me he went to sleep then also. Matt was still awake but turned it off when Sam went to sleep... I woke up today at 10:51. I was going to call my parents but I thought they wouldn't mind. I also found Ashwin awake. Sam and Matt were still asleep. I lied there making noises until 11:20 when his mom came in and told us there were donuts downstairs. We got up at about 11:30 and went downstairs. We each grabbed 1-2 donuts and ate while playing Halo. I came in last both time I think. Or I think I came in 3rd once. Anyways yeah it was fun. We went upstairs then to wrap up and then my dad came. He picked me up and I went home. Now I have to clean up becuase we will be having guests later on this evening. Until next time, this is Talats signing off...

      Today I woke up to my alarm at 9:00 AM. I went for a shower and then went on the computer. I looked at Motorola products. They have a new phone that they just announced. I am going to get the  urlLink Motorola HS820  next week. YAY! Then at about 10:30 we left for the orthodontist appointment. I took a long time so my mom went somewhere to go shopping. When I was done it was my sister's turn. While she was in there, me and my mom went to some card store and bought birthday cards for upcoming birthdays.&nbsp; When we went back to the orthodontist office, my sister was done and we left to go eat. We ate at Pita Inn and then left. It took 30 minutes to get back home. When I got home, I called Ashwin. He told me he was going to hang out with Mike. G. Then I called Matt and told him to come to my house. He came over and we decided to go to the park. We saw Nicole and Liz but we went back to my house and went on the computer. We shot hoops. I got bored because Matt was making me rebound. We got bored and then went to Nicole's house to talk to her. When we rang the door bell, she closed the blinds. Then her parents and sister came. Her mom made her come talk to us. Apparently she was not wanting to talk to us because she closed the blinds because she saw us. It was not much fun. We just talked about how bored we were and about Liz "Kummer". LOL. Anyways we left within 5 minutes. We left and went back to my house and talked to people online such as Nicole and Michelle Wineman. We also talked about stuff like Dreamweaver. Matt tried to diss me a lot but it had no effect on me. Anyways, after a couple of hours, we went back to shoot some hoops. We played 1 on 1. I was close ;). LOL. Anyways, then my dad came home and we called Ashwin over to my house to play but he didn't. Matt left at 6 o' clock and then Ashwin called telling me to go to the park. I said I would but I didn't so he showed up at my house. I told him it was almost time to go to Matt's so I would not join him. I got ready and I'm going to Matt's house.

      Today I woke up at 9 because I had an eye doctor's appointment. I woke up and talked to Matt online. I was&nbsp;also&nbsp;waiting for Nicole to come online.&nbsp; She didn't and then Matt left for a saxophone lesson. So then I went for a shower. I took a shower, came back, and then went to eat breakfast. I had breakfast and went to check the computer again...nope. Anyways. I talked to some Texas people and then went downstairs. I was watching TV until about 10:45 and then we left for the appointement.&nbsp;On the firve there, I got an IM from Nicole. I asked if she would tell me who she liked and she said maybe. Then she had to go and she left. I got there and I got my "contact lesson." It was fun because contacts are better than glasses. I then had to wait until about 10:50 for my mom to pick me up. It was supposed to take one hour but it took 30 minutes.&nbsp; I left and then I went home and ate lunch. Ashwin came over at 1 o' clock because I was bored. He came and we shot hoops and talked with Jigar. We also got Gatorade and stuff. We then called Matt at about 1:15. We told him to go to Ashwin's. We went to Ashwin's at about 1:30. When I got there, me and Ashwin found Ashwin's sister's friends there. We couldn't do anything in the basement so we went back upstairs and Matt came. We then went to the park because Matt told us Nicole and Liz were there. We went to the little park and just sat there. We asked them a lot and tried to make&nbsp;deals with them but they wouldn't crack.&nbsp;Then we went to Matt's and played Poker. It was really short. Then we went to Ashwin's to play Halo. The same order. Ashwin, then Matt, and then me. We then went back to the park to see if they were still there. They weren't of course. We went to Liz's house to ask who Nicole liked. She told us. It was fun and all and yeah. We rode around and then we went back to Liz's because her mom left. We talked to them and didn't bring up the liking peopel topic. Instead me, Matt, and Ashwin kept making fun of her last name. Kummer. LOL. Many jokes. It was mostly Matt, then me, and then Ashwin who didn't do much. LOL. Then we left and went to my house where we watched The Amanda Show and then played ping pong. We played Around The World. They ganged up on me. Oh well, I guess have to take that. Anyways then me and Matt versed in an N64 game I have called Perfect Dark. Matt beat me because I didn't try that hard. Then he left. Me and Ashwin played and we tied but I won because I had more awards. Anyways then me and Ashwin went upstairs and made my forums signature. We then went downstairs and ate pizza while watching  Stump The Schwabb (is that how you spell it?) Anyways we did that and then Matt came. We watched a little bit of  Happy Gilmore . We finished eating and then left to go to the park. We went outside and found nothing to do. We rode around and found Adam Kryzunski and talked to him and Carolina(the new girl.) We were looking for Michelle Wineman. She said she was at her friend's house on N Fiore. We looked for her. We couldn't find her and she said she would go to the park later. She never did.&nbsp;We went to the park and we talked to Aal(is that hwo you spell it?) Anyways we didn't she Michelle. Aal had a dog named Snoop so he was Snoop Dawg. LOL. Anyways he commented on our bikes. He said mine was better than Ashwin's. He said Ashwin's was crappy. And of course he liked Matt's seat. LOL. Anyways, we then went to talk to&nbsp;Kelsey G., Anna, and some little girl.&nbsp;Kelsey is a meanie. LOL. She spat pop corn at Ashwin. Matt left then. It was just me and Ashwin. We continued to ask Michelle to come. She wouldn't. Anyways we rode around for a while and did nothing.Then I went home at about 8:50. I am here now doing nothing really. Just typing to people. I tried to make Matt believe I was mad at him. I talked to Nicole. Anyways yeah. O yeah last night me and Ashwin had a 40 minute 29 second conversation with Nicole on the phone. She wouldn't tell us who she liked. But now we know. LOL. Anyways, remember stay in school and "You Can't Always Get What You Want...You Can't Always Get What You Want." But for that there's Coca-Cola C2. So yeah. I don't know why I said that. Maybe it's because I just saw it on TV.

      Today I woke up at about 8:30 and then went back to sleep until 10:30. I woke up and went on the computer. Guess who I talked to? Yep, Nicole. *Sigh* Nicole what a fox. I remember when Vinayak started using that word. LOL. FOX. Anyways we I talked for a while with her and then talked to other people I worked on mine and Sam's site. It's going good. We're still working on it though. Anyways, I didn't have breakfast, took a shower, and then ate lunch. Then I went back upstairs on the computer. I talked with more people. I talked to Chelsea who's in Florida, Sapna who is one of my friend's sister, I talked Brian also . I kept annoying him about his cousin. LOL. That was fun. Then I did nothing much. I made this blog better by adding Merlin. As you already have seen. Yeah it's all great. Anyways then I went around the house doing nothing. Watched a little TV. Sooner or later I came back to the computer. My mom and sister left to drop off Jigar to work and to shop for school supplies. I still got to do that. And summer projects. AHH! LOL. Last year I got it done in 1 week so it's all OK. While I was here on the computer Ashwin IMed and asked if I wanted to beat Halo all over again. I called my mom and was off. I got there "surprisingly quick" according to Ashwin. We beat the first 3 levels. During this time I was slacking off and talking to Nicole in IM. LOL. So then eventually we went upstairs on the computer and talked to people. One of which included Nicole. It was funny. Ashwin typed exactly what came out of my mouth. LOL. Anyways Sam came and he smelled for some reason. He smelled like sweat. I think it was due to the humidity outside. But you never know. Your best of friends sometimes may not use deodorant. LOL. Sam got bored but I didn't. Ashwin and Nicole made a deal. If he told her who he liked, she would tell him. I was very eager to find out. She didn't tell and Ashwin threatened her to go to her house and ask her personally. He was kidding but I wanted to. So we went riding around and we ended up at the park. I persuaded him to ask her who she liked. He said he would do it at 7:30. So I went home for dinner and then came back out at 7:30. I rode around and waited at the park at 7:45. He wasn't there. I saw Sam following me at 7:50. Then I saw Matt and us 3 saw Ashwin riding the hill. HE DIDN'T DO IT. LOL. So I rushed up and he went down and went to do it. Sam stayed with me and Ashwin went. They came back talking about it. They told me she wasn't home. Matt also told me that Nicole told him that it could be me, Ashwin, Matt, John M., or Adam K. Of course it's not us 3 or she wouldn't have brought Adam K. up. Dang it. Oh well. But then again I don't know. But I REALLY wanna know (thus the title). Man this sucks. When is she coming online. I got to know. Man. I wanna know. Anyways, It started lightening and so we all rode home. It didn't rain. I think it's still not raining. Oh well. Anyways now I'm home talked to Ashwin a little now I'm going to work on my and Sam's site. Seeya.  Tomorrow's plans: Show off my glasses-less face. That's right...contacts. Me be in contacts sonny! YAY!

      In the morning I woke up because Nicole IMed me on my cell at 11:03. So I went on the computer to talk to her. I talked to her for about an hour. Wow! Time flew. I also talked to Michael L. and Anna. Sam told me I can have access to his FTP. YAY! Our site is going to kick butt! I went downstairs and watched some TV. Then I went for a shower and then ate lunch. Matt called me then and we 3-wayed with Ashwin we decided on something but I forgot. I went on the computer for a little while. I talked to Liz and Sam. Then I left to go to Ashwin's. As I was leaving, they were right there. We went inside to see if Sam was online. In that time Ashwin and Matt wanted to talk to Jigar. He was talking to my mom. We went upstairs and asked Sam if he could do anything but he said he was going to his dad's Frullati. We went downstairs and talked to Jigar briefly. He made fun of them in Gujarati and I laughed. Then we headed to Brian's. We got there and did nothing really. Then we went inside. We watched the Cubs game and grabbed some drinks. Christy left for volleyball. His little sister, Katie's, friend had to leave. So we went down and played dodgeball for about an hour. It was mighty fun. I got out first. Matt gave me 2 free lives. During the course of the game, Matt hit Ashwin and he said he didn't get hit. So Ashwin and Matt got all mad and started doing weird things. I kept laughing at Matt and Ashwin fighting. Ashwin flicked me off during the course of the time. LOL. Oh well. They got mad and Ashwin just left. We cleaned up and looked if Ashwin was still upstairs. He wasn't. We rode around. We dropped by Michael Liu's to pick up our money he owed us. He gave me my dime. He's still a dime short. Matt didn't get his money because he didn't have change. Then we went back to my house got drinks, and then went on the computer for about an hour. We talked to Anna about stuff. We also talked to Ashwin. Matt kept scaring me pretending to be a murderer. We also talked to Michelle W. on the phone. It was funny. Matt tried to get some information out of her. We talked to Rajiv. He uses proper punctuation. I find that quite silly actually. I called him a "gangsta". LOL. After all this, we left and went riding around. We rode around half of Grosse Pointe. As we were riding up Ashwin's street, he came outside. Matt told Ashwin about my "minority" paranoia. LOL. We rode around in the same places as me and Matt rode around. We were really close to Nicole's house then we turned around and went to Marissa's because Ashwin wanted to. We went there and did nothing really. We just talked about things. Nick came and we talked to him a bit. Then we all went to Nicole's house. *Sigh* Sweet, sweet Nicole. LOL. Anyways we talked to her. She showed us her Great Uncle's football cards. He used to play on the San Fancisco 49ers. We also insulted George W. Bush a lot. Marissa got really mad. LOL. We called Ben and annoyed him but he kept hanging up. LOL. We got called by Michelle W. LOL. She also kept hanging up. I talked to her for a while. Then my dad called and I went home. I talked to her on my way home. LOL. Anyways I got home and ate. Then I left and looked for someone to hang out with. I found Ashwin at Emily's. I got a freezie-freeze and then we left. We played 21 at Ashwin's. Ashwin won and then we went to the park. We did nothing really just 2 pull-ups and that was it. We rode around a little more and I came home. Now I'm waiting for people to come online. I am talking to this one girl in Texas who knows all my old friends.

      Today I woke up and did nothing. I woke up around 12. Around 2 Sam called me and I told him to come to my house. He did in about 15 minutes. Right when he came, Jigar left. So I ate lunch and watched the new Jimmy Neutron Movie with Sam. It's the one where he has to win the intergalactic games or something to save humans. We watched that for about 30 minutes.&nbsp; Matt called during that time and told me to come over.&nbsp;After that I went down and cleaned up yesterday's mess of when me, Matt, and Ashwin ate dinner and watched  The Minority Report . After I cleaned up a little, me and Sam went upstairs to go on the computer. Matt and Ashwin told us to come over...again. They kept asking what I was doing and I kept saying "I'll be right there!" Anyways we were on the computer for a while and we did nothing really. Then we finally left and went to Matt's. On our way we listened to  Around The World  from my cell phone. I didn't have pockets so Sam had to hold it. On our way there we talked much. We got to Matt's and we played poker. Sam didn't play and didn't bother trying to pick it up. I got a lot of good hands. But Matt just got better ones. He won. I came in second and Ashwin last. After that we went to Ashwin's house. On our way there Matt said he wanted to play me and Sam 2 on 1 but I said no. So instead Matt played Ashwin 1 on 1 and then took Sam 1 on 1. Ashwin lost 11 to 4 and Sam lost 11 to 0. LOL. I didn't play because I was playing with my cell phone. We played 21 after that and Ashwin won. Then we played Go Home. Matt won that. We just continued to shoot around when that one biker dude, his friend, and Michael F. came. They asked if we wanted to pump race. It's where you get a lot of speed and stop after about 10 yards and then glide the rest of the way. Matt peddled the whole way and I followed him. Sam actually participated. LOL. Along the way we ditched them and went back to Ashwin's. He came back out right when we came. He was planning on going to Brian C's. We were on our way there when we saw Rajiv outside. We went to his house and asked if he wanted to play capture the flag. I didn't really want to play. But it was funny. I asked Rajiv if he knew certain things. He didn't seem to be to West Oak smart. LOL. Anyways I was mostly in jail. It was my excuse to just sit there, listen to music, and make jokes with Matt. LOL. Anyways we played 2 games. They won both. Rajiv had to go when his dad came. We got each other's Yahoo! IDs and left. On our way leaving, My button shorts got stuck in Sam's Handle bars and my right side was open. LOL. I had to rebutton it. LOL. I blamed it on Sam but only as a joke. I knew it was my fault. LOL. Anyways then Matt left because he had to eat dinner. I left then too. Sam rode to my house with me. Then he left when I entered. I ate and did some chores then Sam came and I left. I rode around with him for about 2 hours. I was using my mom's V600 because I didn't have pockets. LOL. Sam told me Ashwin's dad told him that Ashwin was at Sullivan Center. Then we rode around more and went to Matt's and asked if he was home. He was at Deerpath playing tennis. We rode around all of Grosse Pointe. Talked a lot and threw pop rocks. We also saw Ashley playing horse with Morgan P. of the 7th grade. We didn't talk much. We also saw Liz outside. We just said hi and rode past. During the beginning of our ride Nicole IMed me. I talked to her on my cell. I nearly hit 2 people and was in high risk of hitting a lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;parked cars. LOL. Anyways at about 9 I went back home. Now I'm here talking in a chat room with Matt, Danny, Sam, and me. Matt told me that he went to Deerfield with Ashwin to play tennis. So he actually wasn't at Sullivan. They went together without me and Sam. But I get it...ooooh I see how it is. LOL JK.

      Today I woke up at 12 and wrote in my Blogger like I said in the previous post. I watched TV most of the time after that. I also went on the computer. Matt woke up around 3 or something and called me to ask if I wanted to do anything. I said yeah and so he came to my house about 15 minutes later. We decided to go to Ashwin's house. When we got there, we found him and his dad trying to fix his bike. They had to tighten the chain. Anyways, after it got fixed, we decided to go to Matt's and play Texas Hold 'Em Poker. I did bad. I got out twice and so Matt's mom made Ashwin give some of his chips to me. Next time I may play with more thought. LOL. Anyways we drank root beer while playing. Matt's brother, Danny, watched us play while eating duck. LOL. After we were done with that, we headed to my house. Matt brought Minority Report to my house so we could watch. We watched it. Jigar (my cousin) came down when Tom Cruise was on the run. We ate tostadas that my mom made. Matt had never had one before. A tostada is a flat taco with the toppings on it. We ate while we watched. We got done eating and continued to watch The Miniority Report. When 3/4 of the movie was done, my mom called us up for mango milkshake. It was good. My mom asked Ashwin and Matt who they thought was funnier: me or Jigar. They both said Jigar. Of course we know why. Matt listens to Ashwin...always. Oh well, I don't care. LOL. Anyways, it was a pretty good movie. I liked I, Robot more though. After it ended, Matt and Ashwin left. Now I am here typing this. I have a feeling I won't be up late tonight becuase I didn't get much sleep last night.

      YAWN! I just woke up right now because I didn't sleep much last night. What happened last night you ask? Brian C. had a birthday party. It was actually really fun. OK so first I will tell about yesterday and then get into birthday party details.    Yesterday:    I woke up at about 11 o' clock. My dad gave me a new phone. It's really cool. I played with that for a while. I had to cut the grass so I did and then went in for a shower. Then Matt told me to go to Ashwin's at 1:30 but I didn't because I had to eat and then go Brian's b-day present. I ate at 1:30 and then eventually went to get the present at 2:30ish. We got him a Best Buy gift certificate. Actually it was a Gamer's Gift Card. He gets $5 off any software or accessory he buys at Best Buy. Isn't that dandy? Anyways I went home. In the car me and my dad talked about Motorola phones and Motorola stocks. We went home and I made Brian's b-day card. It wasn't that great, you know with the slanted words and a picture of a V600 on the front. LOL. Then I went to his b-day party. My parents were in a rush because they were going to I, Robot. We picked up Sam along the way.    The Party:    When I arrived, everyone was sitting down and talking. Everyone was already there. We did nothing much except discuss what we were going to do later. Before too long, we went to Laser Tag. While we were waiting for someone else's game to finish we all talked outside. We made teams. The teams would be me, Ashwin, Matt, Christy, and Katie (both Brian's sisters) vs. Brian, Greg, Sam, Dan, and Natalie(Christy's friend). We had a good game. People on the opposing team got mad at me because sometimes, even if they shoot me right on target, it won't work. LOL. Matt figured out his gun didn't work so he had to switch in the last five minutes. I got hit about 30-40 times. I got a lot of people(due to the fact they couldn't get me.) Greg got so mad at me he followed me around and poked me with his gun while shooting. Brian got me a lot. After the game, we checked the scores. Not surprisingly, I came first of everyone and our team won. After that we went back to Brian's house and played Nuke 'Em. It was fun, I was the leader of our team but the rest of the team did well also. Ashwin was the leader of their team, but Brian did well also. Matt, Greg, and Nick R. were playing Home Run Derby and it kept going over the fence into the neighbor's yard. The volleyball went there once so I had to get it. Then we went and ate pizza. Me and Sam sat in the little kids bench, it was funny. Sam kept imitating me laughing and that made me laugh in return and it was like a big cycle of endless laughter. After we ate, we played capture the flag and they found it once and I found it once. It was odd, as soon as I come to their side, I get bombarded with water balloons. EVERYONE WAS AFTER ME! Why you ask? Because Ashwin told Matt to and everyone listens to Matt. I got killed, then I got some water balloons. I got Ashwin once for doing that to me. That was his only hit. No one else hit him. Why you ask? I have no idea. I hit Greg once also then I got a headshot on Nick. That was it. I got hit most I bet. There was also this one time where I told everyone to get Matt but I didn't myself. While Matt was running he got hit with 3 balloons at the same time in the same corner. It was fun. Then we simmered down and sat and talked. We stopped playing capture the flag. We just chilled. I kind of forgot what we did next but I think Matt, Nick, and Greg went to play Home Run Derby in the front while we played Nuke 'Em. Me, Ashwin, Brian, and Dan went in to play dodgeball. We went in and did so. The rest came in later and wanted to play. We let them for a little while then we went outside for a bonfire. We got a whole bunch of those poppy things. You know when you thrown then at the ground they make a loud noise. We also had sparkly things. You know those sparkly things. We threw those around. Sometimes they went into the neighbors yard. I got burned because I picked one up at the wrong end once. We also had those smoke things shaped like a cone. There was smoke everywhere. It smelled horrible but it was fun. Brian ran around with it and Nick put it in his face and his throat started hurting. Dumb kids these days. LOL. Anyways we also threw those popping things at people. I chased Matt with them. For some odd reason, he was afraid. I should have those all the time. LOL. We had smores(is that how you spell it? That's how they spell it with the cereal.) Anyways we went in and played more dodgeball. It was fun and crazy. The balls were going about 50 miles per hour right into either our body or the wall. Sometimes people got hit in the face. When Dan did, he went crazy. I got hit somewhere else that hurts a couple times. LOL. After a while, Brian's dad came down and told us not to play anymore because his mom and sister needed to go to sleep. We stopped and then did other things. Some of us played video games and some played Texas Hold 'Em. I played video games. We played Super Smash Brothers Melee. Matt and Ashwin made fun of us for playing that. Ashwin is acting really weird now. Like he keeps trying to correct me and trying to outsmart me. What's the point? Can't we all just be friends? I don't want to have a discussion on having cell phones. I have one live with it. I don't want to fight. Anyways back to the party. After we got a little bored we played rugby. We were supposed to play at 1 but since we were getting really bored we changed the clock forward. LOL. That was one hell of a game. People were going crazy. Dan was sweating like the Niagara Falls. It was really hard holding him down. It was me, Ashwin, Matt, and Nick. I didn't score much but I guess I played defense efficiently. People were going crazy. Dan sat on Ashwin's left lung so it was hard for him to breathe but he was fine afterwards. We watched the end of The South Park Movie. Matt and Ashwin went in the corner and talked. I joined them. We were just talking about ping pong and stuff. They played mini ping pong and I went to watch the movie again. It's funny. Anyways Matt and Ashwin snuck upstairs and had stuff to eat. LOL. They came back partially unnoticed. After that, Dan needed to go to sleep because he had church so we turned off all the lights and "went to sleep". Me, Matt, and Greg kept making noises. I used my cell phone light and Brian kept getting mad. LOL. Greg kept tapping (we think it was him.) After a while I reached for Matt and he got paranoid and thought every movement was reaching for him but I only did it 3 times. LOL. Ashwin pretended to go to sleep but I knew otherwise when he laughed at the yelling by Greg. He got really mad actually. LOL. Dan threatened to call his mom. It was weird. I don't see why Brian didn't let him sleep upstairs. After a while there was a huge bathroom break. Everyone needed to go to the bathroom. I DID go but some people went into the kitchen and got food. Brian got mad. Because no one went to sleep, Dan gave up and joined our awake party. We ate and talked. After more time Brian got in trouble and told us all to go to sleep. We "did". LOL. We used my cell phone light to see each other and we talked. Matt made funny, scary stories about CJ. LOL. We all went to sleep eventually. I woke up at 9 and called my mom and she said she would come. I was told that Sam went to sleep at 6 and I don't know about the rest. On my way out I got some donuts. I came home and went to sleep and like I said just woke up.   This entry took me one hour to write with one break and some IMs.

      Today I did nothing in the morning.&nbsp; I did nothing but edit my blog and try to get a GMail invite. I emailed Matt, Ashwin, and Sam to tell ask them if they wanted to go to see I, Robot. I didn't get any replies because Ashwin doesn't check his email, I accidentally emailed to the wrong email address for Matt, and Sam didn't check his email. I called Matt to ask him if he wanted to see I, Robot. He said yes so we decided to call Ashwin and Sam and ask if they wanted to see it. I called Sam and he said yes. Matt told me Ashwin would only see it if Joe went to it. I tried calling Joe but no one picked up. I called Matt again and he told me to come over. I went. When I got there, I found him and his brother finishing up Poker. Matt won a hand and then his brother did. I don't really know how to play but I picked some up watching Jigar play online. They said they would continue later and me and Matt went to Sam's to ask if he could do anything. No one was at his house so he let us come in. We went on the computer and I made a few calls. I called Joe to ask if he wanted to see I, Robot. He approved so we called Ashwin he was going. Then I called my mom and told her to pick up tickets for us. She did and she also got Brian C's present for his birthday. Sam's dad came home so we went to Ashwin's.&nbsp;We played Go Home and no one tried. Ashwin pretended he got his eyes pulled out and played with no sight. The 4 of us played Halo. Joe came at about 4:30 and watched us finish up Halo. After that we went outside and played Go Home. It was really long. We weren't trying at first but then we kind of did. It started raining so all of us rode home as fast as we could. When I got home I took a shower and ate pizza. I noticed that I forgot my watch on Ashwin's front yard. Please no on take it. LOL. I got picked up at 7:00 by Matt. He gave me his money&nbsp;for the ticket&nbsp;at the door. I got in and saw Sam. I collected his money for his ticket. Then we picked up Joe and Ashwin from Ashwin's. Joe kept leaning on me in the car. It was a funny ride there. The car was packed. When we got there, we went in and found seats. It was packed. In front of us was this old couple that blocked my sight. Behind us were these kids and parents. The kids made too much noise. They kept saying stupid things like "whoa!" or "awesome!". Come on, it's just advanced robotic technology killing a guy in a car. The movie was awesome: great effects, acting, comedy, and of course the robots. The coolest thing was the car. And to think that they actually made this car for the movie! It was great. My favorite quote in the movie was: *sneeze*"I'm sorry I'm allergic to BS". HAHAHA. We then left the theatre. Joe had his own ride but my dad wanted to drive around to make sure he got home safely. I bet he felt awkward when we kept driving past him. LOL. Then we left and I talked to my dad about my cell phone problem while Sam and Matt were throwing ticket stubs at each other. I got home and my dad tried to fix my Bluetooth Headset. I don't know if it'll be alright :'(. Anyways today was fun.

      Today I woke up and did nothing. Jigar went on a thing called JobPredictions. It predicted I would be a Superhero. I got a call from Matt later on telling me to come over. Then he caqlled me again to tell me that there was a difference between then and 30 minutes later. I laughed and then left. When I got there Nicole IMed me on my cell phone. I like talking with Nicole. It's great. LOL. Anyways we were jumping rope when we called Sam. He said he would come but he didn't after 15 minutes. So we went looking for him. We saw him on our way to his house. We stopped to talk and we decided to go to the park. Across the street from it, Sam realized his tire was flat. He left and we played tennis. Matt made me warm up with him so he could play his brother. He eventually came back and watched Matt and his brother play tennis. It was weird. His brother was acting weird according to Matt. After that me and Sam talked about making a new website hopefully coming soon. Then Sam left and me and Matt went to Ashwin's to ask if he was there. He was in Mount Prospect. So me and Matt went to my house and went on the computer and listened to music, talked to people, and played a little pool. Nicole left a comment on my blog. Actually it was her mom. She thought I got confused between her and her dad. For the record, I said "Nicole's mom or dad" because I didn't know who it was but I knew it was their car. We left after about an hour. Matt told me that whatever Ashwin told me last night was just a test. Ashwin told me hew was moving to India. I was really upset because I thought it was for real. Thanks for making me worried. Anyways, Ashwin called us and so we went to his house and played Halo. I came in last like always. I don't know how Matt got so good all of a sudden. At least I'm better than Sam. After that we rode around and then went to Rajiv's house. We shot around and then Adam K. and Alex Bahena came. Me and Matt pretended we had to go eat dinner because we were getting bored. We came back after 5 minutes. We eventually left and went to Ashwin's. There we did nothing because Ashwin ditched us for his sister's friends. So technically he went for the people and stayed for the pizza. It's just like the movies. LOL. Then me and Matt left for dinner. I ate and then Sam came right in time. We went upstairs and went on the computer and listen to music. He caught me with my homepage. It's a copy of his. I started cracking up. He started being funny again. If I didn't run away I would've died in laughter. Matt called to tell us he was going to be late. Instead of 7:00 he was going to meet up with us at 7:45 at my house.. We went on the computer again and I wrote in my blog because I usually forget the order in which I do things. Time flew and Matt was here. We all went riding around. We asked Ashwin's sister for Ashwin. She seemed mad. I don't think she likes me. It's weird...she really has a problem with me. Well anyways he wasn't there. We went to Ashley's to check for Ashwin because he was there previously. He wasn't. So we rode around. I wanted to play tennis but Matt didn't. We went around and found Ashwin at Yaz's. He pretended I wasn't even there when I even stopped on their driveway. They all gave me a "go-away" glare. Anyways then I caught up with Matt and Sam. We eventually went to Matt's to just shoot around. We did that and had some laughs with Sam. We decided to go to I, Robot tomorrow. Sam will be joining us. Hopefully Ashwin has time for us. LOL JK. We then played catch with a baseball. Matt and me were laughing at Sam's West Oak 8th Grade Awards such as best dressed, most likely to succeed, best sense of humor, best laugh (me). For each one he did the opposite of the action. It was great. We left at 8:55 PM. Sam and I rode to my house. Along the way I laughed more. I then went into my house and now I'm here. Yeah, today was actually OK. But not the greatest.

      Today I woke up and didn't do much. Yesterday Jigar told me he may be going to Michigan. That's going to suck. I went to Ashwin's at 1:05 and found Matt and Ashwin watching TV. I watched a little with them then we went to the park. At the park we were discussing a storyboard for our movie we're probably going to make. Liz and Katie L. then came to talk to us. Matt's dad and brother came with tennis equipment so we played tennis. Matt beat me and Ashwin. It was my first time playing. I wasn't that bad for a beginner. Then we went to Brian's house and got him to meet Rajiv. We all played basketball. Rajiv is not that great. I sucked today for some reason. I haven't been trying much. But then we I suck the whole game and then try to try I can't because I am down spiritually. It's an odd concept. Anyways We then played Capture The Flag. Rajiv was acting like a little kid. He spoke to Matt in private and said "Let's call time in and tag them." Well Holmes, it doesn't count. We had a little argument over that game. We eventually stopped playing. Brian went home and we played Halo at Ashwin's house. I had to then go home to eat dinner. When I came back to Ashwin's, his dad was fixing his bike. He didn't get it fixed, so I had to peg him like the rest of the day. We tried to get it to work but we couldn't. We went to Marissa's and Ashley was there and so we introduced them to Rajiv. They laughed a little. It's kind of odd when a teenage kid says "It's nice meeting you." I usually expect a "Waddup, put it there homie." LOL. Anyways so then Matt left and we just continued to ride around. At a point we stopped and me and Ashwin switched. He was riding my bike and I was on the pegs. He was playing around and "accidentally" collided into a tree. I'm still bleeding because of it. We walked home with Ashley(I was riding) and Ashwin picked up his bike. We rode around and got into the "I'm an out of control freak" conversation. By the way vote in my AIM poll and please support the Talats Campaign for freedom of laughter. Anyways I went home and talked online. I, Robot comes out tomorrow. I really want to see it. I may if Ashwin, Matt, and Sam don't have anything else to do. Ashwin and Matt don't really want to see that movie much. I haven't talked to Sam for a while because he has been gone to Tennessee. Stay in school.

      Today I woke up and did nothing but go on the computer. I was really excited and kept checking my mail because I just got a GMail account from Fitzpatrick(Thanks again by the way!) So I played a little RuneScape, looked for a good phpBB forum, and then I got called by Ashwin. I went over and found Brian C, Greg, and Nick there along with the usual Ashwin and Matt. We played BBall. Nick sucked. He made one shot because Brian wasn't guarding. Otherwise he'd get stuffed. He also kept forgetting who he was guarding on defense so I had to guard Brian and Greg. Then we went in and played Halo. I did good. Almost as good as Matt and not even close to Ashwin but I was way better than Brian and Nick. I didn't see Greg play but I heard he was bad. Then we went out again and played bball with new teams. Greg was going crazy and wanted to play baseball. Nick was really stupid. He said "Take this something Ambier" and then chucked it out into the street. He ended up chasing it. After that we ditched them and went back to Ashwin's. We went looking for something to do so we went to see if Rajiv could play. His dad said he would be home in about 15-20 minutes. Matt had to go home and so me and Ashwin went to my house. We just IMed and then Matt came so we went back to Rajiv's. There we created SCOOP-Sudden Change Of Obvious Path. Adam K. and Michael F. We all played basketball. Rajiv is not that great. Matt left and then we rode around. We wanted to introduce him to people around the neighborhood. As soon as I put my foot down to get off my bike and Nicole's house, it started raining. Odd isn't it? Anyways we all rode home. Then after maybe and hour I called Ashwin and we went to the park. We rode around and then ended up at his house and then had a along conversation on Ashley having a cell phone. It was stupid. Ashwin has horrible logic. He brings up grades and stuff into conversations about money. We rode around more and talked more. I ate dinner and now I'm continuing that stupid discussion with Ashwin. .I'll win because I don't do drugs. You shoudln't either. I'm Kevin Talati and I approve this message.  Blogger just had downtime. In those two hours I have been talking to Preeti The Great and What el Monkey (The Korvadi Family). Anyways Preeti seems to be really pissed at my laugh. I posted a poll in my profile so please honestly fill it out. The poll is if you think my laugh is too annoying. Support that Talats Campaign. Thank you to the supporters. They got bored and signed off on me like the always do. Anyways I got really mad I just felt like shouting but it's too late to do that. I guess I will go to bed. I am Kevin Talati and I approve this message.

      Today I woke up at 11:30 AM due to the "Awake Contest" we had last night. We all tied and went to sleep at 5:00 AM. The sun was already rising.I went on the computer and played RuneScape with Matt and Adam. S. This was new to me. I found it quite a good time passer. After that I got a call from Matt at 2:45 telling me to go to his house. Regardless of that short amount of time, I pop the pizza rolls into the microwave and switch on the TV. I just sat there eating for 10 minutes and then watched TV for the remainder of the show. After that I finally went to Matt's house. From there we went to Sam's to watch TV and so me and Sam could talk computer. Anyways Ashwin came over then. We talked online and arranged plans. Me and Matt left. We later made on progress. Playing 21 was fun but I was off. I bet it thought I sucked. O well I don't even like it. After that I went home for dinner and discussed our soon to be buisness with Sam. I went back to Ashwin's and we rode around a while and saw it on the driveway a couple times. We went to Saugatuck and met a kid named Rajiv. He's Indian and looked shy. He will be going into our school and our grade next year. He didn't look to outgoing. I hope no one beats him up next year. He isn't going to win best dressed next year I can guarantee you that. Not making fun of him. But those were my first impressions. I want to get to know him. I don't want to prejudice which i know I am not. Matt thought he looked like Mr. Tough Guy but I thought he looked like Mr. Don't Hurt Me Please. Anyways can't wait 'til next year. Lots of things are going down then. Another one of those things says it may be able to. I hope it's true. Anyways then Matt left and me and Ashwin circled Grosse Pointe about 3 times. We stopped and talked to Liz, Nicole's mom or dad honked at us, and I laughed at sayings such as "Let's chizzle with Czosek(Cho-sek)" and "Vandalize with Vladi." I came home and went on the computer. I am Playing RuneScape now. It's not a bad game. I have been warned that it's addicting. So I'll try to not get addicted. I really hope it can.

      Today I woke up and the first thing that I encountered was Ashwin's blog (www.xanga.com/whatelmonkey). It was so stupid. I think it was his sister but it might've been him. She wrote stupid, mean, things about our friend Ashley Z. She criticized one of her blog entries. It made fun of her it said things about her crying, and being happy because she straightened her hair. But what made me mad the most was the comment on having a cell phone.  "Imagine that, an 8th grader with a cell phone. What do you need a cell phone for in the 8th fricking grade?"  Kids can talk on cell phones if they want. Just because they're expensive and more adults use them doesn't mean we can't have them. Anyways she's a girl she can straighten her hair if she wants. Now it may seem like I'm standing up for her but the point is she(or he) shouldn't be trash talking on a Weblog about a friend. Anyways cell phones rock!  Anyways...the rest of my day: I went to Matt's and then to Ashwin's. We rode around and then decided to play Goldeneye. By the way I was still using my scooter then. We played I came second today becuase the losers ganged up (jk it's kool). I went and picked up my "fixed" bike. Actually they gave me a whole new bike (same kind). I then went to Matt's. Sam and Ashwin were there. We then went to the park and played 3 on 3 with Kevin L. and Andrew W. We then left, went to my house for drinks and then went back to Ashwin's to play Halo. For the first time in a while we played Free for All yet there were still stupid allaiances. We played 21 after that. It was really rough. Where's da ref when u need him? I went home for dinner. On my way Adam K. tried to convince me to go paintballing with him. Yeah like I'm goinig to pay $80 to get bruised. I went home ate, and then went back to Matt's. I had a great laugh. We then rode around. We had the oppurtunity but it was blurred a little. We didnt take advantage of it. Me, Matt, and Ashwin might have an "Awake Contest" tonight. Cheer for me. Peace out and long live cell phones!

      Today I woke up and cleaned up because there was going to be people from TX coming to stay that night. I did that and then went for a shower. Wal-Mart called and said they would call us after 2 to tell us to pick up the bike. Turns out the bearing was broken. So I ate and then went to Ashwin's. We went to Ashley's to play with the doggy and talk. I beat Matt in foozball but Ashwin beat me. Me and Ashwin had a close game. Then me, Matt, and Ashwin played Halo at Ashwin's. After that we went to Brian C's to RSVP for his birthday. We annoyed his sister because he was gone for a movie. After that we went to Matt's house to play cards, look at his futon bed, and play Goldeneye. I dominated in Goldeneye. We went to Brian's house again after 2 hours. We asked if he could play basketball. He said yes and so we went to Ashwin's to play. He "beat" me in 1 on 1. I lost fair and square. Maybe I'll really try next time and maybe I'll call half the fouls. Anyways then we played 2 on 2. Me and Ashwin beat Matt and Brian. After that we ditched Brian and hung out at the park. We also visited Michael Liu. After that I had to go home because we were going out for dinner with the people that came. It was fun: Jigar was driving me and Jess(my sister). The radio didn't work. LOL. So I came back home and watched Harry Potter 2 with Jigar, my sister, and the two little kids that are here. I just got done with that and that's why I am making this entry quite late. I think I'll stay awake for 30 more minutes. I never got that call from Wal-Mart. I think I'll call them tomorrow.

      Today I woke up and did the usual: eat, computer, shower, eat again. Then Adam K. came over asking me to come outside. I said no because I had to go get my bike fixed at Wal-Mart. I went there and then dropped off my cousin at his workplace. I then went back home got my sister and went to my eye doctor's to pick up her glasses and ask about my contacts. I have a one hour "instruction appointment" on July 22nd. Can't wait. Anyways I came back home went on the computer then went to Ashwin's where we watched TV and then played Halo. Joe called us and asked if we wanted to meet at his house for our radical band practice. We had a fun time: learned a new song and got a lesson from his dad. We also had pizza and me and Matt were laughing...A LOT! We then left and on the way Ashwin's dad got out of the car to pick up something. Me, Matt, and Ashwin called someone and planned to call that person back but we never did. The best part of the day was the band practice. I'll miss Joe when he leaves. He's much darker in the summer. I find the dynamically skin changing humorous. I then got home and now I am typing this and trying to get my site up and running. I may get a new one soon if I can't access this one. Stay in school and don't do drugs.

      This morning I went online first thing because I had to catch up on all that me and my computer missed. JK. Ya but I went on and Matt gave me a link to www.big-bunny.com. It's SOO funny there's a big bunny and ya find out yourself. They all talk funny. Ya but anyways I called Shwin and he came. Matt called and then came. We were on the computer for a while then Sam came. Then we began our trek to Ashwin's. We played basketball there: Me and Ashwin vs. Sam and Matt. Then we went in to play Halo. We played levels we didn't usually play (which there's only one of.) Matt left at 3 for his borther's ortho appointment incase he needed help with something. Then me, Sam, and Ashwin went to the park and decided to go to Nicole's. We went there and did nothing. Ashwin just talked to her and then we left. We were going back to Ashwin's but I didn't want to ride my scooter so we tried different ways to get there. We just stopped after a while and we sat there and laughed....A LOT!!!! Then finally we went to Ashwin's and played basketball then Halo. I had to go for dinner then. I came back and Matt left right away. Adam came justa  second later. We played with. Matt came back and we played altogether but then got bored. Ashwin went in and then we left. Adam went home so me, Sam, and Matt went to my house to shoot hoops and grab a drink. They then left and then I went in and went on the computer. I have to catch up on everyone else's blogs and xanga's so I'll do that. Stay in school.

      Over the past week or so my computer was broken. I had a couple software issues where Windows wasn't able to find the files it needed. I finally got it fixed this morning. After that I went to Motorola to "hang out" with my dad. I saw all the new phones. Their cool. Anyways then I came home and enjoyed my computer. I am now talking to people and updating my computer because it has fell behind so much.  In the past week I have done many things such as: gone to Matt's, Ashwin's(a lot), Sam's, and Nicole's. We didn't play that much basketball but mostly rode around and played Halo. I got a new bike. I went to downtown Chicago to see fireworks. I went to the summer band thing(BORING).I found out that a certain somebody that can date next year that my "friend" likes. Yeah I basically just hung out with friends and stuff.

      Today was the day we were going to Laser Quest. I set my alarms to wake me up at 10 because I didn't want to have to rush. I had breakfast and stuff and checked people's Xangas and Blogs. Sam said he went to sleep at 5:00 AM. What the heck is wrong with that kid? LoL. I had lunch and talked to Jigar. I had a 4 cheese Hot Pocket. I took a poopie and then watched TV. Brian came at 12:52 or something. Ashwin, Nick, and Brian were already picked up. We went to pick up Sam and then Matt. We then went to eSkape. We met Nicole, Liz, Katie(Brian's little sister), and Emily(Nicole's little). Anyways, we did a Laser Tag game almost immediately. It was 20 minutes and I came in 4th. I had to be on the girls' team because they wanted me to be and plus they needed an extra person so it would be even. It was all fun...except the girls really aren't that great. They would all pile up on the stairs and block me from running. Oh well. I still did well. Our team "surprisingly" lost. LoL. Anyways, then we had a short break where we did nothing. We then went back in for a 2nd game. This time it was me, Brian, and the girls vs. the guys and 2 other kids we didn't know. They won. I came in 7th this game. Stupid, non-working, gun. Anyways, we came out and had pizza. I had 2 slices. Then I went and watched Nicole and Brian play air hockey. Then me and Sam played air hockey. I won of course. Then me and Sam played DDR. I put in too many coins. LoL. Stupid, coin swallowing, arcade games. Anyways, we played 2 songs but then we had to leave our 3rd song half way for Laser Tag. This game it was me, Sam, and these kids we didn't know vs. the rest of our party. I don't know who won that game. All I know was that I came in first. Me and Sam then played a car race game. We couldn't play with each other because I joined in too late. I was doing better than Sam. Brian's mom said we were leaving now. I gave Brian the game and left. He was leaving with us but he still took over. I bought a Powerade and then we all left. Me and Sam talked about our website in the car. Matt and Ashwin were doing their usual gay look at each other and then laugh. They think they're all that and think they're so much better than everyone else. It's weird how Matt even comments on my site. They thought we were arguing. They're idiots. Anyways, we agreed to meet at Ashwin's house as soon as we got home. I got home and went on the computer because it would take a while until they all got to Ashwin's. I then went to Ashwin's. Everyone was already there except Sam. We shot around and then I versed Brian 1 on 1. He won. I lost because it was too hot and I didn't guard his outside shots. Oh well. Anyways, Matt called Sam and Sam was like "Ashwin's house...now?" LoL. In the car he was all like "ok ok". Sam finally came about 15 minutes later. We then made teams. I forgot the teams because I wasn't paying attention that much. While we were playing Nicole and Liz came to watch. As they approached, I got tranced by Nicole. Ashwin passed the ball and I kept looking that way. I caught the pass of course though. LoL. They came and sat on the small trampoline and watched. I wasn't doing so well. Ashwin and Matt kept making fun of me because I wasn't as good as them. Man, they're not going to get far in life are they? Nicole and Liz left in about 15 minutes. Anyways, we continued to play and then I accidentally passed to Brian 1ce and that just ended it. Matt and Ashwin got mad and just stopped playing and then we all just sat and took shots once in a while. I then had to leave because it was close to 5 o' clock and my mom was coming back home soon. She was at the hospital for knee surgery. I got home and went on the computer. I also watched TV. I was on the computer a lot. Anyways, I then ate dinner. Me and my sister prepared it. I watched  You Wish! and ate. My parents got home. My mom looked really tired and dizzy. She went straight to her bed. I went on the computer and talked to people. I then went to help my mom out because she wanted set things up differently. Anyways, I am now here talking to people and blogging. I got to start my summer projects. AHH! CyA later alligator! Hunger lures Kevin downstairs to have cake that his sister had baked earlier today for my mom.

      I woke up today and fixed my computer. YES! It works! LoL. Anyways, I ate breakfast and stuff and went on the computer all the way until 12. I then went for a shower. I got out and found Ashwin and Matt watching TV in my Living Room. I found out Jigar let them in. So I got ready, went on the computer, and then went downstairs to watch TV with the rest. I got hungry so Jigar decided he was having salad for lunch. I decided to have the same. He made our salad. He wanted to put things in like raisins and cheese. I rebelled but then gave up because I was curious and wanted to try and see how bad it was. We went downstairs to find raisins. Ashwin and Matt followed and said things like "Go Jigar!" They're so mean. They always do those things. Like diss me and say how much someone else or themselves are better than me. It's weird. Anyways, no raisins. Muahahaha. Anyways, I had my salad and then Matt and Ashwin went home for lunch. They're weird. Anyways, I chilled at home and did nothing until Matt called me over to his house. I didn't want to leave my computer. I was talking to Matt, Liz, and Ashwin. Liz told me that Gina, Nicole, and herself were talking and said how nice I was that day when I didn't follow Ashwin and Matt and instead played volleyball with them. I'm such a special specimen...I mean kid. Anyways, I eventually went to Matt's house but then talked to Liz because she was outside. I talked to her for like 5 minutes and then Ashwin came and just rode right past so I followed. We got to Matt's house and decided to play video games. I also saw his new Sharper Image fan. That's some nice stuff. So we decided to play a game on PS2 but the controllers didn't work. Then we called Sam over and when he came we played  007:Goldeneye  on N64. We did unfair teams: Ashwin and Matt vs. Sam and I. We lost. Then we played free for all. My dad called me home. I came in 3rd and left for home. I got home and my dad gave me my new HS820 Bluetooth Headset. It's turquoise. It's really cool. Matt told me to go back to his house at 4:15. I went there and everyone was playing poker. Then we went to Sam's house and Ashwin and Matt locked us out while me and Sam looked at all his stuff downstairs. Then we went upstairs and using my door opening expertise, I managed to unlock the door. LoL. We went inside and me and Sam played Simpsons: Road Rage. He won. Ashwin and Matt messed around with his computer and his brother's laptop. Ashwin play really loud music. Then Brian and Greg came and I hid from Greg because he said he was going to beat me up next time he saw me. LoL. He didn't do anything to me. Then we watched Chappelle's Show the Mad Real World 1. HAHA. So funny. Anyways, then Brian and Greg had to go. Then me, Ashwin, Sam, and Matt went downstairs to box. I am not bad for my strength. I'm just fast is all otherwise, Matt and Sam could beat me easily which they kind of did. Ashwin didn't want to box. That kid is losing his kid. LoL. Anyways, I then followed Matt home and then went home for dinner. I ate Indian food and then went on the computer. I called Ashwin and his sister told me that he told her to tell me to go to his house. So I waited about 20 minutes and then left. I was on the corner of my street and Ashwin told me that I was still signed onto my AIM account. I went back and signed off. LoL. I then went to Ashwin's house to find Matt, Sam, Ashwin, Brian, and Greg. We played a basketball game. It was me, Matt, and Sam vs. Ashwin, Greg, and Brian. I did really well that game. We won 11- like 4. Anyways, we then switched teams. It was now me, Ashwin, and Greg vs. Matt, Brian, and Sam. We lost. Then Brian had to go home and so did Greg because he was with Brian. We then just rode around for a long time. We stopped by Rajiv's and he said it was a bad time because he was having dinner. We then rode around more and tried to avoid Adam K. and Alex B. We rode around more and then we all went home at about 8:30. I am here now and I'm enjoying my working computer and I'm talking to Sam on Audio and Video MSN. It's cool. Anyways, I'm going to go to Brian's little Laser Quest invite tomorrow so I should go to sleep...Tomorrow. LoL. Tomorrow being 12. OK CyA.

      I woke up at 9 today! WOW! EARLY! But since I had nothing to do because my computer was broken, I went back to sleep. In case you're wondering...I'm this tomorrow(Aug 2, 2004). So I woke up again at 11. Whoa! A weekly high! HAHA. Anyways, I did nothing really. I decided to go to Ashwin's house at around 3. I went there and he didn't have Halo. So instead we played pool. He didn't have the cue ball so we played with a golf ball. He won by luck. LoL. Not by much. Actually by very little. Anyways, we then played NFL Fever and I lost of course. Sports on video games isn't my thing. Anyways, we got bored so we went to my house. We brought along  Pirates Of The Caribbean . We put it in. Jigar was asleep because he went to watch a cricket game on TV last night. He didn't join me and Ashwin. We watched the movie. It was funny and good. Jigar came down 3/4 of the way. He annoyed me. LoL. When the movie was about to end. My dad called and told me to come upstairs because we were going out to dinner. We watched the end of it. My favorite lines in the movie were "I can't breathe" and "why the rum?" LoL. I went to the bathroom and in that time, Ashwin left. I got in the car and we left. We got there and ate. Good food. We were thinking of telling them to sing the birthday song for Jigar because his birthday is on Aug. 4. We didn't do that. Saved him the embarrassment. We finished and left. We got home and me and Jigar tried to fix the computer. No luck. Then I thought about recovering the system. It didn't work. Then I tried again. It kind of worked but then I thought about fixing it tomorrow. I went to sleep...
