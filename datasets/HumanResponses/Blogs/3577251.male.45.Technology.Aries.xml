      So, I've been prepping for something like three weeks.  The big day is Thursday.  I think I'm ready, but there are some huge butterflys in my stomach (something from the pleistocene era).  What's thursday, you ask (come on, I know you're asking and if not, WAKE UP!)?  Not a game, not a race.  No, nothing so mundane.  It's a job interview (ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  I've been reading so much background information on the company, industry segmen. etc. I think I'm going into overload.  Blogs are great, but they can take alot of time. Kind of like when the internet first took off.  You find yuourself travelling down tangents, discovering new blogs, reading, clicking, "oh my God I've been doing this for 23 straight hours."  Anyway, I'll let you know how things go.  I'm withholding any more details until I actually go through it, so I'll let you know.

      Can you believe all of the people willing to wait in line to pay respects to President Reagan?  I think that says alot about how he will be viewed from an historical standpoint.  He seems to be associated with the rebuilding of American morale and end of the cold war.  Those two issues were the triggers with baby boomers like myself.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's, the threat of nuclear war and the constant competition with the USSR (there's opne for your kids...what does USSR stand for?) were always in the back of your mind.  Did you ever have to do duck and cover drills in grade school?  How about learning the way to the nearest fall-out shelter?  Or having a color coded tag to tell you which bus to get on during and evacuation?  Not like any of that would have helped.  US foreign policy for more than 40 years was dictated by Cold War politics.  Then Vietnam cam along and had us questioning everything our parents took for granted and "great" about the USA.  Throw in a dash of Watergate, a couple of assainations, the overthrow of the Shah of Iran and 52 Americans held hostage for 444 days and you can see why American's morale and view of ourselves needed a little boost.  Then came Ronald Reagan.  You can dbate all you want if the tax cuts he backed or his supply-side economics really helped stimulate the economy (I believ they did), but it's hard to debate that he made us feel good about being American, again.  He told us it's alright to have pride in the flag.  So, here's to you President Reagan.  Godspeed, Mr. President, Godspeed.
