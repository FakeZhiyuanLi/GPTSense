      Even though I am exhausted after today, I must get in my rant to get a good night's sleep. My sister freakin disgusts me. I'm completely serious. Those who've kept up to date with my family drama knows what she's like, but it's like she gets more disrespectful towards my parents, me, whomever, every day. And the fact that my folks continually put up with her sh** astounds me. KICK HER OUT OF THE GOD DAMN HOUSE!! I'm sorry, she no longer has gas money to get to/from work until her next payday because she's giving it to her deadbeat, no job, I-scam-my-own-kid-because-I'm-too-lazy-to-work boyfriend. Make her walk to work Dad, take the bus, whatever. MAKE HER GROW UP!! Stop bailing her out, literally, figuratively, you name it. Just stop. Stop cosigning her bankruptcy papers, stop interrupting your day to bring her lunch, stop letting her order beer with dinner after two DUI's, stop allowing her jackass boyfriend over without backing your threats to call the cops on him. STOP ENABLING HER! I'm beyond angry at her now-- there's no point anymore. She is and will probably always be a me-me-me person, and the way she treats my parents, she can frankly go to hell at this point. But the fact that my parents keep taking it over and over, saying that they're finally going to draw the line and enforce rules but then get lazy about following up with it, I'm about ready to distance myself from all of them. If your own lives, household, health, or sanity isn't worth fighting for, nothing I can try to say anymore is going to change your minds. You pretend to listen, but apparently I'm the only one who feels your existence is worth it. Kick her out, for the love of god, and let her finally live with the consequences of her dumbass decisions. She's freakin 24; she'll learn to deal.  My God! Are there any non-dysfunctional families out there anymore, seriously???  Okay, I'm done now. Really can't wait for the holidays now....

       Today Travis and I went out to run a few errands and have a nibble afterwards. In an attempt to do so, however, we discovered the true meaning of hell on earth as we know it. This hell is otherwise known as U Village. You may be familiar with it, what with its trendy, overpriced department stores and coffee shops, orange-fleshed patrons pushing the pedals of their graduation-gift Lexuses with their pristine Ugg boots. Hell. We honestly could not understand what about this place made seemingly normal people such twits. Parents suddenly flinging their toddlers into the street because they, after all,  do  have the right of way. Stay at home moms in trendy Touregs blocking entire lanes in the parking lot so that they could selfishly have that next available spot, no matter how long the line behind her was. HELL!    It all connects to a bigger picture to me, the things that rank high on my pet peeve list. It's why I hate leaving home on weekends. The chaos, the carelessness, the selfish people who think it's all about them in this world. It's making me already dread the approaching holiday season, for the love of God! I hope people don't mind more internet shopping this year; I fear that with my lowering tolerance and increasing road rage that my braking foot might fail at a very inopportune time for you, dear affluent family with your triple-seated stroller walking down the very center of the road without any regard of my approaching bumper right on your Tevas. Come now, would it really be such a shame to have one less of you out there? I thought not.

      Because I fear The Wraith and Hoggle equally as much, it will probably be a while before a young fellow called Kristensen will hear about my joining the blogging world. For those who do learn of my existence here, expect nothing earth-shattering or mind-blowing. You should know by now that I am a quiet one, not as politically savvy as the men-folk in my life, opinionated still but just choose to keep it to myself more often than not. So here goes, some inner thoughts.  I just read some of Foutsy's previous postings, and I have to say it, he's an outright liar.  When referring to the 4th's fireworks display, he states that he's "just not as impressed with big flashy things."  And yet not a single other person could outjump him or squeal louder than his shrill soprano voice could at Tim's bachelor party.  All of the other men had fallen silent at the sight of the groom-to-be's scrotal bling, but not the Fouts.  It was blinding and it was magnificent.  I like boobs. Most of you do too, admit it. They're one of the only true bonuses of gaining a few extra pounds, and I love it. They're squishy, they bounce just so, they help fill out an outfit just a bit more, they draw (sometimes flattering, other times creepy) stares, they're fun.  Picture two octopi rubberbanded together, and poke.   Neato.  Last night the kids and I went to a local eating establishment and met Tim's new coworker, Gina.  Sweet girl, funny, outgoing, cute for a borderline midget.  I, however, hope that we can use young Gina to get to her acquaintance with a most unfortunate name.  Run and hide,  Tora   Teenus , for you shall have no peace once you are found.
