      well hello people who decided to read this. just to let yal know my titles will never have anything to do with whatever i so choose to talk about.  anywhosle, here's a thought aqua teen hunger force has been moved to only sunday nights. i personally think that is crap.  i went to barnes and noble saturday for buff (chris') birthday and actually found myself sipping on a thingy grande vinty whatever the hell size drink it was of some frozen coffee with cream and it wasn't that bad  we were suppose to go bowling but after getting lost and finding it only because it's by hooters and that's the sign one would see first we then did not bowl but played games only to the guys dissapointment that i the skinny toothpic am stronger than them.  i got three body parts off of the tickets won that evening and one of those was a nose which i then threw on the ceiling of my place of work...the dixie...could not get it down and then laughed so hard someone thought i was crying....yeah no..... ~i think that's enough for one blog~                                                             TO BE CONTINUED......

       well i'm watching the olympics and i would just like to say that Carley Patterson and Mike Phelps are my idols! they kick bum and more power to Carley miss. baton rouge.      well i also went talk to my boss at work he told me that they are planning to move me to the back so i can stay off of a register and when i learn how to air brush they will make me my own little office space...slightly larger than some more like two cubicles to four put together and since i can't work in bakery i can still work for them just not in the actual bakery. so yay for me i can't wait to learn how to air brush i've always wanted to and then i can make cakes so that's even better. yay. i say ole chap that was some pretty stupendous news.      pip pip cheerios......mmm chicken

      le sigh. the job at the dixie might not last as long as i would of liked it to. due to the fact that no one is perfect i guess that's why they can't hold on to cashiers lucky me i got a second chance but i can't screw up any more. it's not like i don't work because i do but that's not important to some people. justin is moving in the back as part of the stock crew. i will miss him up front but if i get "let go" to put it politely i won't see him again. hopefully the guy has the gal to ask me out since he keeps giving hints that me and him should go hang out together.  when i got off of work last night i bought me some poster boards for my english project and he was like i'm bringing that to your car. well everytime he brings something to my car we end up talking for ten minutes. he says me and him need to go out unfortunately it would be with his friends...for now anyway. but i would rather just go out with him. the thing i like the best about him is i don't know him extremely well but i'm super comfortable around him and he can make me laugh to the point of crying and not being able to breathe. also he makes fun of me sometimes that would normally embarass me if a guy i liked would tell me that, like my eyes spazing out, but around the guy i find it funny and the fact that he mimics me makes it funnier. o i don't know what's going to happen. i think the thing that bothers me most about my future with the dixie is the fact that if i do get fired, yes i said it, i wouldn't see justin and i think that is what upsets me....hmm infatuation much?  i'm sleepy
