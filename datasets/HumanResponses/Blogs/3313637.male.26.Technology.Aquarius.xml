       So I took the time tonight to make a couple of dishes. First up was a sun-dried tomato pesto with penne pasta:  1 bottle of sun dried tomatos in olive oil 2 gloves of garlic 1/4 cup of pine nuts roughly 15-20 leaves of fresh(hydronated) basil  Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor including the oil from the tomatoes. blend well, remove and fold in a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  Cook pasta noodles al dente and combine with pesto, add roughly 1/3 to 1/2 cup of hot water from pasta to the pesto and stir well.  My other recipe was just a quick salad I threw together.  I took a couple handfuls of baby spinach, 1/3 head of red cabbage, 2 small cluster tomatoes, 3 apricots cut into 1/8ths, and combined them into a bowl.  Then I made a vinegrette using avocado oil and sherry vinegar, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  If you make 'em, let me know what you think!

       Ok, so I wasn't able to make everything I had to, but I got most of it done! So, without further ado, here are the recipes:    Smoked Salmon Guacamole  4 Ripe Avocados  Juice of 2 limes  1/3 cup of red onion, minced  1 tomato diced  1 teaspoon of chile powder  1/2 teaspoon of salt  1/4 cup cilantro  1 6oz filet of salmon, smoked(you can smoke it yourself, or cheat and buy it presmoked   Spoon the avocado into a bowl, add the juice of 2 limes. Mash with a fork until creamy and add chile powder, salt and cilantro, mixing well.  Flake the smoked salmon into small bits, then cut into smaller peices using a knife.  Add to avocado, mix well and add final ingredients.  I also made a traditional guacamole without the salmon,which was basically the same recipe minus 1 lime.   Sun Dried Tomato Salsa   10 sundried tomatoes  5 vine ripened tomatoes(about 2 1/2 pounds), cut into chunks  5 cloves of garlic  2 Scallion stalks  4 limes juiced  1 Jalapeno  1/2 C cilantro  1 teaspoon salt   Soak the sundried tomatoes in hot water while preparing the rest of the salsa, allowing them to reconstitute a bit.  In a blender or food processor, add the tomatoes, garlic, scallions,lime juice, jalapeno, cilantro and salt. Blend for a few seconds,allowing it to remain chunky.  Pour all but a cup of salsa into a separate bowl.  Drain the sundried tomatoes, and add them to the rest of the salsa still remaining in the blender. Blend them til they are well mixed with the salsa and add to the bowl.  Using a fork, mix well.  All turned out extremely well, and people raved.  I personally would have enjoyed the salsa more if it had only 1/2 a jalapeno, as it had just a bit too much of a bite.  The watermelon spiked with raspberry stoli vodka was fantastic as well, and the sweetness of the raspberry stoli really added to the flavor.  One tip, we found that buying a syringe from CVS allowed us to add the vodka with relative ease.  Anyhow, if anyone makes these recipes, please contact me and let me know what you think!  -Vegetable Man

       My roommate's friend, Melisa, has just moved into her new house and is throwing a small bbq party this Friday.  It would be unbecoming of me to show up empty handed, so I thought I would bring the following:     Smoked Salmon Guacamole   Sundried Tomato Salsa   Blood Orange Sorbet   3 Watermelons(1 spiked with grey goose)     I would bring more, but it really isn't my party.  Should be fun, hopefully that guacamole will turn out okay, I've never smoked a fish. I'll post recipes on Saturday for those interested.
