      currently listening to:  train -  she's on fire    wow, working for an american company is a strange experience, i can tell ya... today has been a long and tiring day...it was our opening day at  urlLink cheshire oaks ... the company i work for is called  talbots .  it's a clothes shop...huge in america apparently...i'd never heard of it myself... anyway, they are a bloody fussy company to work for in many ways... but i got a payslip this morning, so that made me happy! my feet are killing me...it's been a long time since i had a full-time job...and even longer since i had to spend eight hours on my feet! the only thing that got me through the day was remembering that i'm earning Â£6.50 an hour for this... i got my own set of keys today, and did my first cashing-up and closing the store... the only problem is that since i started there last wednesday, i seem to have done nothing but work and sleep... i'm turning into an old woman...it gets to 10pm (oh, it's that time now) and i can hardly keep my eyes open... think i'll have a nice long soak in the bath and then have yet another early night... just call me "grandma"...!  ;-)

      currently listening to:  supergrass -  moving    i'm back online...after 11 internet-free days, my isp  finally  fixed my connection...hooray! today was my fourth day in my new job...(or three if you exclude friday's two hour shift!!) my job is pretty damn boring (as i'd expected) but i'm managing to find things to laugh at (as usual) and i can't really complain.  i'm being paid for 24 hours work last week, when in reality i was only there for about 15 hours...and only physically did about an hour's work...if that! there is a lot of standing around doing nothing, which might sound like a good job, but it's deadly boring and makes the day go verrrrry sloooowly... but things are better this week.  we're now at the new shop, putting the stock out etc, and we open on thursday... i think it will be fine once we all settle in and get used to it there... and it's not forever anyway... just long enough to pay off my huge overdraft, save some money for transatlantic airfares, start looking for a good graduate job, finish my driving lessons, take my test, get my car and insure it etc, ... hmmm, i could be there for awhile judging by that lot... ;-)

      thank god, someone wants to employ me at last! the high-paid, but boring job i applied for is now mine... i'd be lying my ass off if i said i'm looking forward to starting, but the money is good...and let's face it, people only work for the money...! i'll have quite a lot of responsibility...i'll be a keyholder, so will have to open up and close the shop...i'll have to do paperwork, and cashing up the till, etc... but i'm sure i can handle it, and having lots of lovely money for it will, of course, be wonderful... one of the girls that's just been employed there has just graduated from keele (it's a small world, indeed) i didn't recognise her, and she didn't recognise me...but it'll be fun to have someone to talk about the good old days of keele... (i have my rose-tinted glasses on already it would seem)  in a completely unrelated matter let me just say that i hate my internet service provider... i lost my internet connection on wednesday night, and they still haven't sorted it out, despite the fact that i've phoned them several times, and so has my mother... so, i'm down at my local library at the moment...just to check my email for the first time since wednesday, and see what's going on in the world of blog...  oh, and Caroline (if you're reading this)...just wanted to let you know that i've finally yielded and read the first two  Harry Potter   books, and am half-way through the third... it pains me to admit i'm wrong (again! remember the  Lord of the Rings  and my refusal to watch it until i saw that gorgeous picture of Aragorn in your room?!) but i think they're great...i wish i'd read them years ago... i finished the second book on saturday morning (having no internet connection frees up a lot of time!) and then went to the video shop to rent the video...really enjoyed it... (and Alan Rickman is fantastic as Snape...) :-)

      currently listening to:  simon and garfunkel -  the sound of silence    i'm wondering if someone has put something in the water... something that makes the usually rude, grumpy and ignorant people of my hometown somehow happier, more polite, friendlier... when i left the house this afternoon, my neighbour actually spoke to me (nothing unusual there you think?  you're wrong.  i have not spoken to this woman for  ten years .  our whole family fell out with her about six months after we moved into this house...and none of us have spoken to her since...we hold serious grudges in this family!) on my way to the nearest bus stop, i noticed that people were smiling and / or saying "hello" to me (nothing unusual there either?  well, maybe not.  but this is not the kind of town where people acknowledge people unless they know them) then when i went into the jobcentre to see what the latest jobs are, i noticed that the usually bad-tempered, and frankly unhelpful, staff were being cheerful and helpful...taking time to have a proper search through the system for jobs that i might like to apply for... (anyone who's been to ellesmere port jobcentre will understand how bizarre that behaviour was!) other things i've noticed today too, makes me suspect that some  good fairy  has put something in the water to make us all this way... i wonder if it will last...? ;-)

      currently listening to:  richard ashcroft -  god in the numbers    it's too hot i know i shouldn't complain, because this gorgeous weather is something of a freak occurance in this part of the world (england), and i know i'll be wishing it was hot again when the inevitable poor british weather returns to us... but i still think it's too damn hot... sleeping last night was almost impossible...i had my window open as wide as it goes, but there was just  no air whatsoever  (well, there  was  air, or i'd be dead right now...but you know what i mean!) and it feels even hotter today. i just want to be lazy and sit out (in the shade so i don't burn) in the garden, sipping a cold drink, reading a book, enjoying the rarity of a british summer... but, no...i have things to do this afternoon (following my morning of cleaning, doing laundry, washing dishes, and being a general slave here at home) the sooner i get a job the better...i hate this working for free (although my mum would argue that i'm simply "earning my keep")  oh, and another thing...  i want ice-cream  :-)

      currently listening to:   the beatles -  eleanor rigby    i've been in quite a reflective / nostalgic mood today it all started when i couldn't find anything i wanted to listen to this morning, and decided to listen to music that i hadn't played for awhile... now, i don't know about you (if anyone  is  reading this), but i usually associate music with past events, people, times in my life... i don't do this for every single song i hear, or for every cd i own...but there are a hell of a lot of memories hidden among the music i own...  good memories   bad memories   sad times   happy times   people i miss   people i'm glad not to know anymore...  hearing music i hadn't listened to for a long time made me feel nostalgic, regretful, made me smile, made me shed a tear, and made me reflect upon my life so far... (god, that sounds melodramatic, doesn't it?!  i basically mean i started to think about my life...past, present,  and  future) i'm missing keele, i'm missing having my own space, i'm missing being  away  from my family (i like them better when i'm not around them), i'm missing the student lifestyle, i'm missing friends i probably won't get the chance to see much now... and i wish someone could wave a magic wand for me, or look into a crystal ball, and tell me what life has in store for me now (not every single detail of the rest of my days, but a brief outline would suffice!) but i know life doesn't work that way...we make our own paths in life...we are changed forever by our own experiences...and ultimately we only get out of life what we put into it...  end of nostalgia.  time for some forward-thinking...

      currently listening to:  embrace -  come back to what you know    today has to have been one of the most lazy days of my entire life (and believe me, there have been  many  lazy days) my excuse for being so sloth-like is that i'm ill, so i felt fully entitled to be a lazy little b***h for the relatively few hours in which i was actually awake today... i haven't bothered to get dressed at all...i didn't see the point when i knew i'd spend the day indoors...and a lot of time asleep. but it's been quite nice to be a lazy slob for the day (although it would have been nicer if i'd felt fit and healthy, along with the laziness)... i've done absolutely nothing worth mentioning, unless you want to hear about the episode of  Quincy  i watched?... or what i ate for lunch?... or about the crazy robot-sounding, script-reading moron who phoned trying to sell me double-glazed windows...?  nah, i didn't think so...

      currently listening to:  radiohead -  just    why, oh why do people  *never*  phone when they say they will? it really annoys me...a lot...i absolutely  hate  waiting... i had a job interview yesterday morning (just for a full-time job working in a shop.  nothing special or exciting.  but the money is  really  good for that kind of job) the interview went well...the hourly rate had actually increased (by fifty pence an hour, but every penny helps) since the job was advertised... the shop looked like an extremely boring place to work, but beggars can't be choosers...and, like i said, the money would be really good so i could put up with the boredom... the woman who interviewed me seemed really positive, even showing me the draft of the rota she had just drawn up to see if the hours & days seemed fair... i was then told that it was possible that i could get a phone call that afternoon (i.e. yesterday) or the next day (i.e. today) asking me to start on monday in the store in birkenhead, until the new shop opened in ellesmere port... but here i am, playing the waiting game...waiting for a phone call that will probably never come... such is life...

      currently listening to:  u2 -  electrical storm    well, i had planned to actually go out and *do* something with my day off work today, but when it came to it i just couldn't be bothered... i had planned to go out and do some shopping, and then go to see  pirates of the caribbean  at the cinema... but i woke up late, and then didn't bother to shower or get dressed until about an hour ago, and i just can't be bothered to do anything that requires  any effort at all  now. (and i don't feel remotely guilty for my laziness either...it's my day off, and i'll spend it however the hell i want to!) i'm still trying to readjust to non-student life, i think...  being lazy  like this, and  doing nothing constructive , would have made me feel guilty during my final months at keele... i'd be thinking "i should really be working on my dissertation...or finishing that english essay...or reading that book...or revising for my final exam..." etc... but now i don't have to do any of those things... i can come home from work at the end of the day and do  anything (or nothing)  i want to... but it still feels kinda weird to be honest...and i can't get used to having  real money  (by "real" i mean that it's  money i've earned ,  not borrowed ) i find myself thinking that Â£50 is way too much to spend in one go...but actually it isn't, is it?  it's less than what i earn for one day's work...and it's my money - i can spend it on what i like, and i don't have to worry about paying it back...

(fingers crossed everybody)  i haven't been able to get into blogger to update for a whole seven days...that's a long time...i've been itching to write and update my little effort of a blog. but now that i  can  update, i'm struggling to think of anything worth saying at the moment. oh, the irony...

      currently listening to:  grandaddy -  now it's on    i'm wondering how i managed to get my current job when i lack all commitment and enthusiasm for it... i must have done a good job of blagging my way through the interview, because otherwise my manager would have realised just how lazy i really am. i was technically  in charge  today...being the only full-time keyholder in today, with the two part-timers (catherine and julie)... so, maybe this meant i should have been giving them instructions?, or asking them to do certain things?, and arranging breaktimes?, etc etc... but i did none of these things...we just "went with the flow". and when it came to closing time (7pm) we had already closed everything down, locked the doors, cashed up, and done all of the paperwork... we were slamming the back door behind us at exactly 7pm... (i hope the manager doesn't check the times on the printouts, or she'll realise i closed everything down  before  the real closing time!) but do i care? no, i don't...my feet were killing me, i was hungry, and i didn't want to miss my bus home... i'd better start behaving myself, or i'll find myself out of a job by the end of my ninety day probation period. but, on the plus side - today was  our best day  for sales so far...so that will reflect well on me.  :-)

      currently listening to:  the coral -  liezah    i've realised that i spend far too much time moaning about things (both verbally, and via this blog). this could give people the  (probably correct)  opinion that i'm a miserable, moaning old woman... so, i've decided to sit here and think about the things i enjoy in my life... not necessarily the big things...just  life's little luxuries ... such as: vanilla diet coke; the smell of lime; garnier  body cocoon  lotion;  impulse zen  body spray; vodka and coke (with ice and a slice); long soaks in the bath; waking up in the morning and realising i have the day off work; pay day; getting text messages/emails/phone calls from friends just when i'm feeling a little unloved; buying a new cd; taking my shoes off at the end of a long day at work; nice customers (rare...very rare); babies' little hands and feet (awww); knowing that it's only a matter of days now until i can buy  the two towers  on video or dvd...  and so many, many more things...  see, i'm not such a miserable old cow after all...?! hahaha

      currently listening to:  the coral -  secret kiss    my nan had her meeting with her social worker yesterday and she's actually feeling much more positive about her own future now... she's accepted that moving into a residential care home is a necessity for her, and that it won't be as bad as she was imagining it would be. so, that's a bit of a relief for all of us...we just need to wait for a place now.  in the meantime she'll be staying in hospital.  i feel absolutely knackered today.  i  seriously  didn't want to get out of bed this morning, but had to because i was working... the day didn't go any better after that.  i never did manage to wake up fully, so i have been in  a mild zombie-like state  all day... thankfully, i have the day off tomorrow so i can have a lie-in and catch up on some sleep... i'm beginning to regret taking this job now though, and am wondering how long i'll be able to stay there before i either: (a) strangle my boss (b) stab a customer to death with a sharp pencil (c) go stark raving mad with the relentless boredom of the place, and end up in a lunatic asylum...  or (d) all of the above...  ;-)

      currently listening to:  athlete -  westside    i feel kind of sad today... it seems unlikely that my nan, who has been in and out of hospital for a couple of months now, will  ever  be able to go back to her own flat... she's having a meeting on monday with social workers, my mum, my uncle, etc. to decide  the best course of action  for the future, and it looks like it will involve my nan going into a nursing home... it's so frustrating because mentally she is in perfect condition...it's just her mobility that prevents her from doing what she wants to do, and what she needs to do, to be able to live in her own flat... i'm going to visit her in hospital this afternoon, and i'm not looking forward to it...it's heartbreaking to see her like that now, but i know she'll be happy to see me... i've never  really  thought about getting old before...but now i am thinking about it, and i'm dreading it already!! old people often say that  youth is wasted on the young , and i'm beginning to understand what that means now...

      currently listening to:  moby -  we are all made of stars      why, oh why, do my days  off  work go so quickly, while my days  at  work go so slowly that i sometimes think my watch may have stopped...? i was off work today = the day is over before i realised it i'm working tomorrow = i'll feel like i should have celebrated at least one birthday before the end of my shift (tomorrow's shift is particularly boring - 11am-8pm.  i guarantee we won't even  see  a customer after 6pm...)  but i must remember that i'm being paid for this...and therefore i should stop moaning.  my brother, Dave, appeared at Chester magistrate's court today (the charge was only "drunk and disorderly."  thankfully the police didn't realise that he'd also been driving!) he got a fine of Â£100 plus court costs of Â£60, and was made to feel  very, very small and disgraced  by the magistrate. i think that's more than enough of a punishment really... so, that's that over and done with, and now he's off to Majorca for a week (he joked before he left for court that if he wasn't back by 4pm today there was a free holiday on offer... to which i replied "great...leave the ticket somewhere handy for me!") aside from all the trouble he caused, it was really good to have him back at home for a while... and every time he visits he brings all of his latest cd's for me to copy, and get copies of all my latest cd's we've often bought the same cd's...but this time was good (i copied 9 of his cd's...he copied 5 of mine) add those nine to the two cd's i bought in the new  urlLink HMV  on Cheshire Oaks today, and i'll be busy listening for some time to come...!

AT A FIRE STATION...WITH REAL FIREMEN...!!!!!!!  no prizes for guessing which one i chose...  it could be fun... (but knowing my luck, all of the firemen at the station i get sent to will be old, overweight, and ugly!) at least it won't cost me anything...the company will pay all the expenses. and i've never been to London, so that will be a new experience for me... i just hope i don't get lost...

      currently listening to:  turin brakes -  blue hour    i spent most of my day at work today wondering why the hell i've had so many jobs in the retail sector when i quite frankly  hate  the general public... (okay, okay...that's a generalisation...but most of them are frickin' morons...) take today for example: we've been having some technical problems with our pdq machine (the machine that we swipe credit and debit cards through) and everytime we swipe switch cards (one of, if not   the , most commonly used card) the machine tells us we need to call the authorisation centre to authorise the transaction... so, i was serving a particularly awkward customer and had to stifle a groan when she handed over her switch to pay for the (hideous) clothes she was buying, because i knew she'd be annoyed by the delay... so, i phoned them up, and they ask for the card number, expiry date, etc from the card. when i'd got the authorisation and finished the transaction, the woman starting having a go at me...saying that i'd "compromised the security" of her card, and that i should have used the phone in the office, blah blah blah... well, i don't have much patience with people like this, and don't appreciate being spoken to in the way she was speaking to me, so i was less than polite in my response of: "well, what do you want me to do?  they asked for your card number, and how do you expect me to give that without speaking it down the phone?!"  to which she said:  "you should have used another phone...in the office perhaps?"  me:  "i can't do that because i can't leave the shop floor or till unattended"  her:  "well, you still compromised the security of my card"  me:  "how do you reckon that?"  her:  "anybody listening could have written the number down"  me:  "there's nobody else in the shop" [you stupid bitch]  her:  "well, i'm still not happy about it"  me:  "well, there's nothing i can do about it" [so why don't you just fuck off and get a life] blah blah blah...i thought she'd never stop moaning... meanwhile, her husband just stood there...keeping quiet and looking stupid...   it's customers like these that piss me off...

      currently listening to:  the strokes -  is this it    this is an awful thing to say, but sometimes i wish i was a single-child orphan... as much as i love my family when they are  normal  (which is very rare these days) i have to admit that they often just annoy, embarass, or anger me...  here's what happened this time: my  mum  (the alcoholic) stayed out all night...using my nan's empty flat (she's in hospital) as a drinking den...she finally came home at 11am, totally drunk and acting her stupid self, as is usual for her... my  brother  (happy 31st birthday today?!) got hauled off to the local police station at 3am for being  drunk and disorderly  it sounds quite funny, but i assure you that i wasn't laughing in the early hours of the morning...outside in my pyjamas, trying in vain to drag my brother through the front door, while no less than  four police officers  stood watching me... he'd been at a barbecue at his friend's house...drank way, way,  way  too much...didn't know what the hell was going on, and actually  drove his car home  in this state... then he got confused and was practically trying to break in to neighbour's houses...screaming, shouting, swearing, and being generally crazy along the way... needless to say someone phoned  the police ... by this time, i'd heard all the noise and looked out of my bedroom window to see two policemen grabbing hold of my brother. i ran outside (in my frickin' pyjamas!!) and told them he was my brother...then two more police officers arrived...then a bloody police van!!  it was like there was a riot going on or something... the police were really good though, and tried to get him to come inside (they weren't going to charge him, since he'd done no real damage) but he started going berserk...i was trying to drag him inside, but i think he was hallucinating or something, because he freaked out... so, after much struggling, screaming, shouting etc, they had no choice but to handcuff him (no easy thing, he was ready for a fight by this point) and bundled him into the back of the police car... all of our neighbours were watching all of this... to cut a long story short (!) he was released from jail this afternoon (after being charged with being drunk and disorderly)... what a lovely way for him to spend his  31st birthday...!!!

(sorry Scott!  25 is not  that  old...but then  i'll always be younger than you!  hahaha)

      currently listening to:  coldplay -  spies    urgh, i feel bad today...   and unlike yesterday when i got sent home four and a half hours before i was due to finish, i had to do my full shift today... i've also had to deal with the complaints of fellow employees, who find it much easier to talk to me, than to our manager... but i don't mind that. i think i'm a reasonable person...willing to listen to people, and attempt to give advice. sadly, there was not much i could do about a suspected case of internal theft, and a f**ked-up rota... i'm like a little go-between at work...they all talk to me about any problems they have, then i either a) sort it out for them or b) talk to the manager and get her to sort it out (i know how to handle her) so, anyway...i'm glad i've got the day off tomorrow.  i can just relax, and try to keep my nasty cold germs to myself :-)  on a totally different subject, i got a music-related email today, and it made me think about how much  i  value music in my own life... there is not a day that goes by when i  don't  listen to music... music when i get up in the morning; music as i get ready for work; music all day at work; music now as i write this blog (i can't go on the internet without music playing); music on my personal cd player when i go to bed.... and people wonder why i spend so much money in  urlLink hmv ...?!  ;-)

      currently listening to:  robbie williams -  me and my monkey    dammit...i felt great this morning, but now i can feel the horrible beginnings of a nasty cold coming on... and i just know that i'm going to feel even worse tomorrow morning, but will have no choice but to get up and go to work...  "oh, cruel fate...why do you mock me?"  (i never thought i would see the day when i'd be quoting homer simpson, but there you go...!) yeah, i know i'm being a little melodramatic...it's only a cold...it won't kill me... and it won't be able to wipe the smile off my face...only six weeks until i fly off to america... p.s. i  am  coming back...despite what everyone may believe (or hope...?) ;-)

      currently listening to:  turin brakes -  the optimist    it just goes to prove that to make plans is making sure that the unexpected will happen to alter the course of events... today was the second day of my three consecutive days off work, and as happened yesterday, the plans i had were changed... i went to look at the house my sister was interested in buying (as was planned) but that soon turned into a whole afternoon of visiting one estate agent after another, in a desperate attempt to find something suitable in my sister's price range. ellesmere port is one of the worst areas a person would choose to live (in my humble opinion, at least) yet the price of houses here seem to have rocketed (for some unknown reason) so finding somewhere halfway decent is extremely difficult. but, we seemed to be lucky in our search, and went to view the property straight away, and to my utter relief, it was very nice...very nice indeed...will she put in an offer?  watch this space...  by the time we got home (my home, at least) i was tired, hungry, and had a banging headache...but i only had time to have a quick shower, get dressed, and go out again, to meet my good friend, nicki, outside the cinema... her sister, bec, and their friend, matt, were there too...so the four of us went for a meal at  urlLink nando's  (chicken is the only thing on the menu...and good chicken it is too!) before joining a very long queue to get into the cinema (so  that's  where the entire population goes to on a wet and cold saturday night, is it? ;-) ) we saw  urlLink  underworld  . a strange tale of vampires battling against werewolves...and i've come out of the film with a still unformed opinion of it...i'm not sure if i thought it was good, or just bizarre...?! and now, saturday is drawing to a close...i have one more day off work left to enjoy, and in which to do all of the other things i had hoped to do this weekend... but i'm wondering what will happen tomorrow to alter my plans...maybe i should let fate decide what i shall do (either that, or just stay in bed all day and hide from the unpredictable world...) :-)

      currently listening to:  kings of leon -  happy alone    my plans for today were changed by the unexpected arrival of my brother, dave... he's back from the isle of wight for the weekend, and he turned up at our house this morning looking for something to do... he asked me if i wanted to go to chester with him, so he could go clothes shopping, but he didn't buy much there and wanted to go to cheshire oaks (where i work) to see what else he could get. we went into  urlLink diesel  to see my brother's mate, jamie, who was just about to finish his shift. jamie suggested we all go round to the  urlLink blue planet aquarium  (neither of us have been there before, despite living so near to it!) where his sister, laura, works... we got in there for free (normal admission costs Â£8.95)  and  got a free meal in the restaurant too! (food tastes even better when it's free) it was a really good afternoon...seeing all the weird and wonderful fish, frogs, seahorses, etc... and we went through the glass tunnel and stood as huge sharks swam over our heads...it was amazing... so, the plans i had made for today went out of the window...but i enjoyed the day... and i still have two more days off work after today...plenty of time to do all the other things i had planned... :-)

      currently listening to:  supergrass -  sun hits the sky    my results from  urlLink the past life test : "You were male in your last earthly incarnation. You were born somewhere around the territory of which we now know as modern Argentina, approximately in the year 975. Your main profession was: entertainer, musician, and poet. A brief psychological profile of you in that past life: You were both wise and respected by your peers, but also feared for your forward thinking and wish for change. A lesson that your last past life wishes you to learn in your present life is: You should develop your talent for love, happiness and enthusiasm, and to distribute these feelings to those around you."  no more quizzes now...i'm bored of them... (but you're reading my fourth blog entry of the day first, so you still have two more quiz results, and a regular blog entry, to read...you lucky, lucky people...hahahaha!)

      currently listening to:  the hiss -  clever kicks    this is how bored we get at work sometimes: me and catherine (or rather "catherine and i") had a ten minute conversation today on who's better: christina what's-her-name or britney spears? considering that both of us have similar taste in music (which certainly  doesn't include  the likes of christina  or  britney) it was quite a bizarre thing for us to talk about... [we didn't come to much of a conclusion...unsurprising when neither of us actually care!] and that is possibly the most interesting thing that to me happened today...?! that's pitiful, isn't it... ;-) nevermind...tomorrow is another day.

      currently listening to:  richard ashcroft -  brave new world    my nine hours at work today have been the slowest nine hours of my life... how can nine hours asleep feel like five minutes, but awake it feels like an eternity...? it wasn't that the shop was particularly quiet either...we were actually quite busy today (for a change), but still the day dragged on and on... and then, five minutes before we were due to close at 7p.m, an annoying woman came in and starting strolling around the shop, picking everything up, looking at prices/sizes/colours, taking her time...not even thinking that perhaps the staff have homes to go to... she eventually left the shop at about five past (yeah, i know...what's five minutes in a lifetime?  but, like i say, it was the longest day of my life, and she didn't even buy anything after all, and we still had to cash up and close everything down before we could go home...i don't think i'm being unreasonable)  and i just found myself thinking "what am i doing here? i have a degree, so why aren't i in a better job? why can't i ever do what i  want  to do? why don't i ever  know  what i want to do?..." and i'm sick of people asking me what i want to do now that i've graduated...and then asking me  why i don't know  what i want to do... is it so unusual for someone  not  to have their entire life planned out in exact and rigid detail? am i a freak for being unsure (even clueless) about where i'm headed in life? is it time i grew up and stopped floating around from one job to another...one course to another...one idea to another? or will people eventually accept that  this is me ...this is  what i am like ...this is  how i feel ...? and why should i care so much what other people (including my family) think about my life?  [too many questions...not enough answers...]  and anyway, if i were to tell them what i'm hoping to do, where i'm planning to go, and what i'll get up to when i get there, i don't think they'd like what they were hearing... so, i'll keep that information strictly on a need-to-know basis for now. it's best all round, i think.

      currently listening to:  grandaddy -  now it's on    have you ever noticed that if you just read the lyrics to a song (however good the song, and however much you love it) it just sounds a bit silly...? it's not like reading poetry. for example, at the moment i'm mostly listening to the album   sumday   by  grandaddy ... one of my favourite songs off the album is called   the group who couldn't say.   the lyrics to this song are:   the tale i'm gonna tell, is about the group who couldn't say, together they discovered with each other, the perfection of an outdoor day, they had won some kind of prize, for sellin' way more stuff than the other guys, they were the shrewdest unit movers, so their bosses got 'em tours of the countryside,  holly saw a certain bird, but she couldn't work up any words, she kind of lost her shoes and lost her mind, then smashed her phone upon a fallen pine, daryle couldn't talk at all, he wondered how the trees had grown to be so tall, he calculated all the height and width and density, for insurance purposes,  and at the desktop there's cryin' sounds, for all the projects due and no one else is around, and the sprinklers that come on at 3a.m., sound like crowds of people asking "are you happy what you're doin'?", and at the desktop there's cryin' sounds, for all the projects due and no one else is around, and the sprinklers that come on at 3a.m., sound like crowds of people asking "are you happy what you're doin'?",  becky wondered why, she'd never noticed dragonfiles, her drag and click had never yielded anything as perfect as a dragonfly, and then the supervisor stood, right in the creek and it felt really good, that's about the time when finally he had realized, the importance of this day, that's about the time he realized, that he was with the group who couldn't say, they felt so good it hurt, forget the words, they were the group who couldn't say.   doesn't sound too good, does it? but i assure you that it is...it  really  is!  :-)

      "The Iceman Cometh," by Eugene O'Neill, which opened on Broadway on this day in 1946; the following is part of the Act IV pitch which Hickey makes to the others at Harry Hope's last-stop bar, trying to get them to swear off pipe dreams:        "Can't you appreciate what you've got, for God's sake?       Don't you know you're free now to be yourselves, without       having to feel remorse or guilt, or lie to yourselves       about reforming tomorrow? Can't you see there is no       tomorrow now? You're rid of it forever! You've killed it!       You don't have to care a damn about anything any more!       You've finally got the game of life licked, don't you see       that? ... Then why the hell don't you get pie-eyed and       celebrate? Why don't you laugh and sing "Sweet Adeline"?"

      currently listening to:  the hiss -  back on the radio    oh dear, i amaze myself with my stupidity sometimes, i really do... i was completely bored at work tonight, so decided to get the vacuum cleaner out... but i wasn't paying attention to what i was doing, and sucked up the wrap-around thing from a particularly nasty cardigan we had hanging up...  (imagine a really bad, woolly, maroon-coloured dressing-gown-style-cardigan that not even your elderly grandmother would want to wear, and you're somewhere close to this monstrosity...i swear, whoever designed this s**t should be buried in it...) but anyway, i digress... so, the wrap-around thing was all wrapped around the roller in the vacuum cleaner...and then there was an awful smell of  burning rubber.   but my stupidity didn't end there, oh no, no, no, no...  i pulled it out of the vacuum cleaner, and then switched the thing back on to carry on... and then the smell became unbearable...and  smoke was pouring out  of the bottom of the cleaner... bluddy 'ell, i had visions of the whole thing catching fire, or exploding, and burning the whole shop (along with all the gorgeous stock...*snigger*) down... (slight overreaction there, i know...but you know how the mind can get carried away sometimes...!) but i'm too cowardly to own up to my own stupidity...i'll just say that it's faulty and should be taken back to the shop...or something...!!! catherine was there with me (laughing her head off at the whole situation!) and i know she'll back me up with whatever lame excuse i come up with. and it did liven up a particularly dull day, at least... :-)

[i'm just adding this as an afterthought...i want you to understand that these people i'm talking about are truly weird...it's not just me being cruel, nasty, unfriendly, unsociable, ignorant or childish...they are strange and i don't feel comfortable with them being around me...i'm sorry if that makes me sound like a bitch, but it's just the way that i feel...i know that we are all a little freakish on our own peculiar little ways, and that's fine...but  properly  weird people just scare me...and that's the way it is...thank you for listening.]

(or the last one is rearing it's ugly head for one more battle against my immune system, perhaps...) i blame the appallingly low temperature in the shop where i work...i'm sure it's against some human rights law to have to work in such cold conditions... anyway, the last cold i had took way longer than a normal cold would take to clear up...and i knew it was because i was stood in a cold shop for five days of each week...it wasn't allowing my body to recover...(or something like that, i'm no doctor, obviously...) and now i'm getting ill again...but i'm going to try harder to fight it this time... i've bought some high strength effervescent vitamin c tablets (at 1667% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin c) and i'm hoping this will awaken my immune system and prepare it for battle... :-) i also plan to cut my daily cigarette intake down as much as i possibly can stand to...that should help... but, urgh...i hate colds.

      currently listening to:  david bowie -  space oddity    i bought (yet another) cd yesterday...well, two actually. but one was only a single, so that doesn't count...! anyway, this one was cheap(ish) and has loads of cool classic songs on it... such as: gladys knight and the pips -  midnight train to georgia ; freda payne -  band of gold ; the animals -  house of the rising sun ; queen -  i want to break free ; foreigner -  i want to know what love is ; genesis -  follow you follow me ; and eva cassidy -  over the rainbow .... so, not the kind of cd i would usually buy, but i can put it with all the other oddball choices of cd's i've bought over the years (like,  the wizard of oz  soundtrack; the  o brother, where art thou?  soundtrack;  ella fitzgerald -  gold  ...and i'll stop there, before i embarrass myself any further!)  (there's no accounting for taste, i guess...)  i've finally admitted to myself that i'm beginning to develop a problem...  i buy waaaayyyyy too many cd's...!  so, i'm setting myself a little challenge...i will not buy any more cd's this year (commencing  after  i've bought  the strokes  new album, and  r.e.m. 's 'best of' album, naturally...) oh dear, what have i done...what  have  i done...?!  ;-)

      currently listening to:  sheryl crow -  the first cut is the deepest    i met a lucky man today...a  very  lucky man... it was the guy from securicor, who came to collect our feeble takings from the shop... the very same man who, a couple of weeks ago, was attacked as he left another shop on the outlet village... maybe "attacked" is not the right word... he was actually shot at...twice...with a sawn-off shotgun... but he managed to scramble into the back of his van...unhurt...and with the box of cash intact... and i have the nerve to complain about  my  job?  at least i don't run the risk of being shot at on a daily basis... so, i'll leave my moaning for another day...because you just  know  that it wouldn't stop me from ever complaining again... :-)

      currently listening to:  weezer -  undone (the sweater song)    on the bus going to work this morning i had to giggle at an advert for something (i forget what, strangely enough...) the main part of the advert said:  hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia - the fear of long words...  whoever came up with the official name for that particular phobia must have been a funny man (it had to be a man...it just  had to be ...) :-)

      currently listening to:  royksopp -  so easy    i had a driving lesson this morning...it's been ten weeks since my last confession (i mean  lesson ...) ;-) it was fun to be back on the road...putting innocent motorists and pedestrians lives at risk (hahaha...only kidding!) i wasn't as bad as i thought i'd be after such a long break from driving...at least, i  hope  i wasn't... then i had an afternoon of returning faulty / rubbish purchases for exchange / refund... namely, a personal cd player which had a mind of it's own and would only play cds it liked, and a dumb purse that wasn't quite big enough in the banknotes compartment to actually take banknotes larger than Â£5... ooh, and i bought myself a new jacket...call it my reward to myself for getting back behind the wheel of a car, and for being brave and taking rubbish things back to the shops they came from (i usually try and get my mum to do things like that for me...!) :-)

      currently listening to:  doves -  last broadcast    i went to liverpool today with the intention of spending lots of money on some new clothes, and i succeeded... usually, when i go out on a mission to spend money, i can't find anything i want and return home empty-handed and slightly down in the mouth... but today was good...and i'm thanking liverpool for my success... i hate the way that liverpool has a reputation for being a rough place...sure, some parts of it  are  rough, but isn't that the same with every city in the u.k? i will have to make more frequent trips to liverpool when i want new clothes...it's so much better than chester, or cheshire oaks... anyway,  good day for purchases, bad day for bank balance  (so i just won't look at that until friday, a.k.a payday, and it won't seem quite as bad...i hope...!) :-)

      currently listening to:  turin brakes -  stone thrown    my watch stopped at 6.15 (ish) this morning...and i've felt naked not wearing it today... i kept looking at my watchless wrist throughout the day, and always had a mild moment of confusion when the time wasn't there for me... it's amazing how much you can miss the simple things...like being able to know how long you've got left at work...how long you've been waiting for the bus, and how much longer you will have to wait for it...how long you've had so far of your lunch break...etc etc etc... i wasn't completely at a loss for knowing the time because i had my mobile phone with me, but it seemed so much hassle going into my bag each time i wanted to know the time...  lazy, i know...  pure laziness ... :-)

      currently listening to:  travis -  the last laugh of the laughter    (i have highlighted the parts i believe apply to me)  Thank goodness for open spaces, because the Horse  needs plenty of room to roam ! Energetic,  good with money  and  very fond of travel , Horses are the  nomads  of the Chinese Zodiac,  roaming from one place or project to the next . All of this Sign's incessant activity and searching may be to satisfy a deep-rooted desire to fit in. Paradoxically, Horses feel  a simultaneous yearning for independence and freedom .  Horses  crave love and intimacy , which is a double-edged sword since it  often leads them to feel trapped . Love connections tend to come easily to Horses, since they exude the kind of raw sex appeal that is a magnet to others. This Sign tends to come on very strong in the beginning of the relationship, having an almost innate sense of romance and seduction. Horses are seducers in general; check out any A-list party and you're bound to find the Horse in attendance. This Sign possesses a  sharp wit  and a scintillating presence; it really knows how to work a crowd. Surprisingly, Horses tend to feel a bit inferior to their peers, a misconception that causes them to  drift from group to group  out of an irrational fear of being exposed as a fraud.  An  impatient streak  can lead Horses to be less than sensitive to others' needs. These colts would rather  take a situation firmly in hand  as opposed to waiting for others to weigh in or come to terms with it. The lone wolf inside the Horse can  at times push others away , but this also makes this Sign stronger and is a key to its success. Horses are  self-reliant  and, though they might  lose interest fast in a tedious, nine-to-five day job , are willing to do the work necessary to get ahead.  Horses tend  not to look much at the big picture ; instead they just  follow their whims , which can result in  a trail of prematurely ended relationships, jobs, projects and so on . This Sign really  knows how to motivate others , though, and  get a lot accomplished . Once they find some peace within themselves, they can curb their wandering tendencies and learn to appreciate what's in their own backyard.

      currently listening to:  the coral -  in the forest    i've finally admitted to myself that the season we laughingly call  summer  is over, and  winter  is here (or is it just  autumn  in disguise?) okay, okay...it's not truly winter yet, but it felt like it today... it was freezing in the shop today (our heating is on the blink...d'oh!)... when i went out at lunchtime, i had to zip my big coat all the way up, and fight through the wind and rain with my not-so-trusty umbrella (i gave up after the third time it blew inside-out...) and it was already dark when i left work at just after 7p.m...i stood and waited for the bus, dreaming of a nice hot meal and a nice hot bath (in that order...) and now it's past 9p.m. and despite it being a saturday night (and despite the fact i'm only 24, still in the prime of youth...sort of!) i want nothing more than an early night, curled up in my nice warm bed, and (hopefully) some sweet dreams... before the cycle starts again in the morning, and i have to brave this wintery weather to go to work...  such is life.

      currently listening to:  elton john -  your song    today has been a day of therapy...laughter therapy, and cleaning therapy... (not that i need therapy, as such...just a means of taking my mind off my hectic thoughts for a little while...) i  really  didn't want to go into work today...i hate working on sundays.  it feels unnatural to be out of bed; dressed; and waiting in the rain for a bus at the ungodly hour of 10.30a.m. on a sunday, but i had little choice in the matter... but it turned out to be quite a therapeutic day... ange and i stood around and laughed at weird and/or stupid customers for most of the day...hence the laughter therapy... and then we did some manic cleaning of the shop for an hour or so, to try and make the day go by quicker...hence the cleaning therapy... so, not a brilliant sunday...but maybe it was more productive than the alternative...which, obviously, would have been pure laziness. and, of course, i shouldn't forget that i earned Â£58.50 for today...and that's what i'm doing it for, after all... :-D

      currently listening to:  the white stripes -  you've got her in your pocket    i was told two unusual things about myself at work today... 1. that i have a certain "healthy glow" about me since i came back from america... 2. that i'd be "worth a fortune" in the middle-east (apparently due to my hair colouring), but that i'd be worth more if i was "plump, rather than slim" (which made me laugh, as i wouldn't describe myself as "slim" at all...!) so, i'm not sure if i'm flattered by these comments, but there you go... :-)  i had some really bizarre dreams about space last night... they must have been prompted by me watching a documentary about  urlLink the last flight of the  columbia  space shuttle , and the reasons for that horrible disaster...seems it could have been avoided, which just makes the tragedy even worse...  and on a lighter note...we had a discussion in work today about brussel sprouts (yeah, it was a slow day), and why we insist on having them on christmas day, even though nobody actually  likes  them...what's that all about...?!

      currently listening to:  r.e.m. -  nightswimming    (...and yes, i'm bored out of my mind at the moment, and can't face watching  the bodyguard , which seems to be the only watchable thing on t.v tonight...)  it's physically impossible for you to lick your elbow.  (i tried...it's true)  most dust particles in your house are made from dead skin.  (i knew that already)  the electric chair was invented by a dentist.  (that figures...)  the human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood a distance of 30 feet.  (ahem...no comment...)  dr. seuss invented the word "nerd".  (god bless dr. seuss for that...)  starfish do not have brains.  (i never really thought they did)  granite conducts sound 10 times faster than air.  (science?...straight over my head...straight over...)  canada is a native indian word meaning "big village".  (awww, bless canada)  in 1987 american airlines saved $440,000 by eliminating one olive from each salad served in first class.  (expensive olives!)  when christening a ship, instead of using champagne, the vikings would sacrifice a human being.  (i wouldn't have thought they had champagne in those days, so that makes sense... ;-) )  any object washed up upon the shores of the u.k is legally the property of the queen.  (sounds like it could very well be true)  an iguana can stay underwater for 28 minutes.  (how, and why, did somebody discover that fact...?)  an original ingredient in coca-cola was the drug cocaine.  (i knew that already)  being unmarried can shorten a man's life by ten years.  (i'd have thought it'd be the other way around, actually...hahaha)  the average human eats eight spiders in their lifetime while asleep.  (eek! yes i knew that already too, but had forgotten about it!)  more people are killed annually by donkeys than die in air crashes.  (i'll be staying away from donkeys then...)   well, i feel better now that i know all that useless information... :-D

      currently listening to:  the electric soft parade -  lose yr frown    i'm in danger of letting my life just sweep me along...sweep me into routine, and monotony, and unhappiness... i've only been back at work three days, but already it's beginning to feel like i was never away from there... and that i'll  always  be there... but i cannot let this happen...i cannot let a temporary thing (which was what this job was supposed to be) turn into a semi-permanent thing... it seems that i'm approaching a fork in the road of my life (sorry for the melodrama, folks...i watched too many american soaps while i was in mississippi...! ;-) )... and i'm not sure which road to take... which will be the best for me? which road will lead to good? and which could lead to bad? and why do i feel like i'm having some weird kind of life crisis at the moment? could it be because i turn twenty-five in a mere six weeks?! and that i somehow see this as a significant milestone...a significant age...? i need to get a grip of reality, i really do...this is getting ridiculous... :-D

      currently listening to:  athlete -  one million    today was day one of being back in reality... after a hazy, sleepy weekend recovering from my transatlantic travel, it finally became monday morning... which can only mean one thing - time to go back to the hell that is commonly referred to as "work"... the day didn't start off too well, with me getting up late, rushing around like a lunatic, and getting to work with only seconds to spare... but the day was not as bad as i thought it would be (the manager was off, so i could leave an hour early)... however, it was still enormously crap to be back at work again... nothing has changed...i doubt anything ever  will  change there. i went to check the post in the afternoon, and for some reason (well, i'll try and pretend i don't know the reason, but i do...) a song suddenly popped into my head as i walked up to the mailroom... i can't remember who sang it, or the title, but it goes something like this:   and nothing ever happens... nothing happens at all... the needle returns to the start of the song... and we all sing along like before... and we'll all be lonely tonight... and lonely tomorrow...   i think my brain is warning me that i'm officially back into the monotony that is  my life  at the moment... and that i don't want to be lonely...  and that i should do something about it...but what?

      currently listening to:  i am kloot -  untitled #1    this is the first time i've blogged from somewhere other than my own house, and the first time from america... :-) it's only tuesday now, but already i'm beginning to dread the inevitable prospect of going back to work on monday morning (jetlag permitting, of course)... from the first day i started that job (mid-july i believe it was) i told myself that it would only be a temporary thing...that somehow, despite years of confusion about where my life is heading, i would soon know what i wanted to do career-wise... but, no, that isn't quite the case yet...i seem to wait in vain for a flash of inspiration in that department... anyway, being away from work has at least given me time to think about things a bit more...away from work, home, england...and i think it's about time that i sorted myself out... a few things that must be done: 1. pass my driving test 2. seriously look into what my career options are now 3. start paying off some of my mounting debts, instead of blowing my wages on junk 4. lose weight, get fit, quit smoking (hahaha...none of those are going to happen, but it sounds like the kind of thing that should be in such a list!) 5. think of some more things that  should  be in such a list... ;-)

      currently listening to:  the electric soft parade -  things i've done before    so that's it...my last day at work for a whole fortnight... it was a long, boring, and horrible day, and by eight o'clock i was completely knackered... so knackered that i completely lost the plot (so to speak) and messed up with the cashing-up... it took me about five times as long as usual, and i still have a nagging doubt about the accuracy of it... but, hey, who cares?  it's not my problem now... my holidays start now...so i'm not going to lose any sleep over it... and despite the bitter cold wind that threatened to dampen my spirits as i left the shop, there was still a spring in my step as i walked to the bus-stop to catch the bus home... and i strongly suspect that this was due more to the fact that i go to america on monday than the prospect of not seeing that shop again for awhile... :-D

      currently listening to:  david gray -  please forgive me    A carp in a New York fish market shouted warnings about the end of the world, two market workers claimed. They were so shocked that they killed the fish and sold it.  A Midlands man lost his false teeth while swimming in the sea on holiday in Crete. Local fisherman later found the choppers in their nets, and returned them to their owner when they asked round the town if anyone had lost a set.   Australian Dennis Carr chopped the head off a deadly snake with a spade. He later picked the head up, and it bit him.  A California man fell off a ladder on to an 18-inch electric drill, and speared himself through the eye socket and out by his ear. He survived - and amazingly the drill missed his brain.   A preacher in Ohio called out to God for a sign, shortly before being hit by lightning.  A sandwich shop owner from Manchester found he had the same phone number as God had in the film Bruce Almighty. He got up to 70 calls a week from people seeking advice from above.  A bull escaped from a market in Lancaster, and made its way into a china shop. Hundreds of items were broken.  A woman had "angle" tattooed on her back, after asking for the word "angel". The tattooist said he was dyslexic.  A Newcastle guillotine operator cut the top of his thumb off, and then cut his finger off when he showed his boss how he had done it.  Passengers on a bus in Shanghai got frostbite despite it being 35C, when the bus's air conditioning went wrong.  Nudists on a Dorset beach complained to the authorities when they were accidentally sprayed with weedkiller.  A Croatian man set himself and his house alight when he tried to get rid of a wasp nest.

      currently listening to:  rage against the machine -  killing in the name    i'm not sure what's wrong with me recently, but i feel kind of edgy... sort of nervous, for no apparent reason...and i've also become quite clumsy... i've broken a few things at home, and i'm forever walking into things... but, hey, hopefully it's just a phase... i've been worrying about my friend, Fleur, too...she's not having the best of times at the moment... she's been considering dropping out of her teacher-training course...but she assures me that she will take time over the christmas break to fully think about this, so i can stop worrying so much now :-) work is as crap as ever...my mum is sick of me moaning about it all the time, and tells me that i need to get myself "a plan or two"... this is easier said than done...i still have no idea what i want to do with my degree, or whether i want to move away from the area and try my luck elsewhere... i wait patiently for a flash of inspiration, but nothing so far... i'm also worrying about turning 25 next month...when i was younger, this seemed like a very grown-up age... i imagined that i'd be all settled by the time i was 25...all grown-up...probably married, with a kid or two...certainly not living at home with my parents still...and certainly not living in ellesmere port... how foolish young dreams can be... reality can be a bloody nasty bitch sometimes... :-)

      currently listening to:  doves -  where we're calling from    today and yesterday have officially been The Most Boring Days of My Entire Life So Far (TM)... i'm pretty sure i slipped into a temporary coma at several points during the day...but i can't be certain... they have also been The Slowest Days of My Life So Far (TM), with the twenty-one hours i've worked during the last forty-eight hours feeling more like a century, or possibly longer... if i didn't hold on to the thought that i only have two more days left there, i'd have found the nearest sharp object and slit my own wrists... yes, it really was  that  bad... the highlight of the day consisted of staring out of the shop window, watching big fat flakes of snow swirl around in the wind, before falling to the ground, and promptly melting away in the puddles of rainwater... how exciting... (in my chronic state of boredom and despair it really was quite exciting...and that's just tragic, i know...) but it didn't last long...and now the town seems to be covered by a sheet of ice...meaning that i slipped (but thankfully didn't actually fall) at least seven times in the brief time it takes me to walk from the bus stop to my house... there's no way on this earth i'll be having my driving lesson tomorrow afternoon if the roads stay as icy as they are now... i value my own life too much to take such foolish risks... ;-)

      currently listening to:  travis -  pipe dreams    the curse of the modern age - text messages waking me up in the middle of the night... i must remember to switch my mobile phone  off  at night (or at least put it on silent mode...) but, anyway...it's sunday, and i've actually had the day off work...(oh, sweet miracle...) after working the last three sundays it's been nice to have the day of rest  as  a day of rest... :-) and it's not been wasted...i've been to see  the lord of the rings: the return of the king  for the second time... tomorrow marks the first day of my final week at work...only another thirty-eight working hours of my life will be wasted in that place... and i'm holding on (no,  gripping on ) to that thought to get me through this week...

      currently listening to:  jeff buckley -  grace    after almost six months of regularly lying my ass off to old ladies at work (i.e. telling them i think the hideous item of clothing they are trying on looks goods on them) i decided it was time for some honesty - with surprising results... so today, when a woman asked me if the god-awful trousers she was trying on made her thighs look huge and bulging, i said "yes, to be honest, they do..." and she  thanked me  for my truthfulness...! she could then believe me when i told her that other items looked good on her (which they did...) and as she was leaving she said "thanks for all your help...i'll look out for you next time i visit..." but, of course, i'm not likely to be there next time...since i only have six working days left before i leave...!

      currently listening to:  the electric soft parade -  sleep alone    what the hell is the point of e.e.cummings' poetry? and why is it all so oddly punctuated? and am i a philistine for not liking it? answers on a postcard, please...   who knows if the moon's a balloon,coming out of a keen city in the sky--filled with pretty people? (and if you and i should  get into it,if they should take me and take you into their balloon, why then we'd go up higher with all the pretty people  than houses and steeples and clouds: go sailing away and away sailing into a keen city which nobody's ever visited,where  always        it's             Spring)and everyone's in love and flowers pick themselves

      currently listening to:  travis -  re-offender    this is the first time i've ever worked out my notice in a job... in the past, i've usually just quit there and then...never bothered to give them much notice... it's strange, because i'm wondering why i'm still there for another eleven days when i've quit... and everyone keeps asking for updates on what i'm going to do now (which i just don't want to discuss with them right now)...  but it's fun too ...i'm starting to take big liberties, because let's face it, i don't give a f**k if they sack me now...!! so, i'm taking increasingly frequent cigarette/drink/ just pure laziness  breaks; i'm taking slightly longer than sixty minutes for lunch; i'm not bothering to approach customers; i'm not attempting to persuade them to actually purchase something they don't want anyway; i'm reading a newspaper at the till; i'm nipping out to get some hot chocolate ("with cream, please") from starbucks; and i'm just going home when i get truly bored out of my mind (five o'clock today...i was supposed to finish at six-thirty, so i think i lasted quite well...!)  naughty me ... :-)

      currently listening to:  the vines -  homesick    so, i'm back...i've had enough of a break from the world of blog (the truth is, i kind of missed it...which is just sad, and weird...but anyway...) what's new?  well, not a hell of a lot, really... i'm  twenty five  now...(twenty five years and three days, to be exact...) and it's not as bad as i had feared...the body is still functioning; i don't think i require a hip replacement, or hearing aid  just  yet... work still sucks...i was toying with the idea of handing my notice in on monday, but my mother absolutely refuses to let me live here for free, and she can't stand the idea of me hanging around the house, unemployed and complaining about having no money... so, next plan = to sort myself out and get a new job  before  i quit this one...oh, how mature and sensible  that  seems... ;-)

      currently listening to:  i am kloot -  untitled #1    "...say you're like a field of tulips, cheap gold flowers in the sky..."   i now have a new job...i shall be working in a gift shop  urlLink here...  it's a lot less money per hour than my last job, but at least it's not going to be so deadly boring and quiet... and it's only seasonal, until september (or early october...), plus i don't have to start until the 28th of march... so, i have four more weeks of laziness ahead of me (legitimate laziness, this time...) i'm quite looking forward to it...i love the zoo...and if i  do  get bored i can go and watch the animals...maybe have a chat with the giraffes...and avoid the chimpanzee who hates redheads (according to the ever-wise julie, there is a chimp there that goes absolutely berserk when anyone with red hair is around...) and, of course, it all has purpose -  money, money, money...  (i hereby promise to be more sensible with my money this time...i have places i wanna go a.s.a.p...there's no stopping me now...)

      currently listening to:  the carpenters -  yesterday once more    "...when i was young i listened to the radio, waiting for my favourite songs..."   since leaving my job, i've lost my life of routine...i rarely need to set my alarm clock these days, because i rarely have a specific place i need to be at a specific time... i can hardly believe it's been twenty-five days since i last did a day's work...it's gone by in a blur of late nights and late mornings... i haven't been idle...i've been applying for jobs (but having no luck, so far)...i've been helping my mum with housework, and shopping, and the like (all highly exciting, i can tell you)...i've been catching up with friends (long time, no see)...i've been keeping appointments (dentist, job centre, council, benefits people); continuing with the driving lessons; blogging; listening to music (old and new); watching films (but not much television); reading books... but it's no longer a life of routine, of certainty, of regular pay days... and i'm wondering why i'm still here, and not in hattiesburg with scott (if you're reading this...i miss you)... as my ex-workmate, and still friend, julie said to me yesterday: "why don't you just pack your bags and go, mate?" i was lost for words...i know i  have  reasons for still being here right now, but they don't immediately spring to mind these days... it was something to do with driving lessons; and debts to pay; and other things i can't think of just now... but i know that the sooner i pass my test, the better...the sooner i find a job, the better...and the sooner i'm making my way to manchester airport, the better... because i may be here in body, but i'm not here in spirit... and these haven't been the easiest days of my life...but i'm holding on to good thoughts... always ...

(otherwise known as  shrove tuesday  to religious-types, but i'm only interested in the pancakes)... yummy...i love pancakes...i'll probably have about four, because i'm a pure glutton :-) so, that means tomorrow is the start of lent...maybe i'll give something up this time (despite being unreligious / non-religious...or whatever the correct phrase is...?) it would do me no harm (and a lot of good, too) to give up chocolate for a month... i'll give that some thought...perhaps...maybe...well, i'll at least consider thinking about contemplating the idea... ;-)  update:  i was good...i had three pancakes (although i secretly wanted a fourth...!)

      currently listening to:  paul weller -  above the clouds    "...time just lingers on the wind, bristlinâ through my open fears, i wonder what itâs going to bring..."   you know, more and more these days, i'm thinking about my purpose in life... (i don't mean that to sound so dramatic...i'm not contemplating suicide, or thinking that my life is crap, or anything morbid like that...and i'm not trying to work out the meaning of life, either...) i'm just wondering what the hell i'm doing...looking at the bigger picture...thinking about the tomorrows instead of the todays (and forgetting about the yesterdays as much as i can...) wondering how to deal with people asking me "have you got a job yet?" or "what are you going to  do  with your degree, anyway?" or "well, what would you  like  to do?"... would my whole life turn out to be a complete failure if i didn't ever get some fabulously well-paid and important graduate job?  who would it matter to, anyway?   i think i'm just going to have to accept what i have strongly suspected for a long time now - that i'm a drifter; that i have no set-in-stone plans for myself (and maybe never will); that i value happiness above success; that i want to earn enough money for the things i want, and as long as it's in a job i  quite  enjoy, then that might be enough for me... i'm not trying to save the world (i think it's beyond help, if the truth be told) i want an easy, stress-free life...i want to laugh (and sometimes cry)... i want to love, and be loved...and enjoy each day for what it is...  that could be enough for me... and i want to regret things i've done (although not too much!), and not regret missed opportunities and things i  didn't  get around to doing... " carpe diem ", and all that... :-) (am i getting stupidly philosophical in my old age?  if so, i do apologise...)

      currently listening to:  the kings of convenience -  failure    "...have no fear, your wounds will heal..."   i had the oddest memory today, and i don't know what brought it on...once again i am struck by just how amazing the human brain is - squirreling away odd little scenes, images, words, and emotions in the memory for future reference... anyway, the memory was this:   year:   circa 1992   place:   sutton high school (informally called 'mill lane')   people:   mr. speed (the biology teacher in my day...as camp as a row of tents...made me think of freddie mercury, for some reason...); and a class of teenage students (myself included, obviously...)   event:   mr. speed's collection of stick insects (don't even ask...) had "escaped" from the tank (or some comedian had left the lid off - a more likely explanation, considering the presence of immature students...)   reaction:   panic (mr. speed), fear (most of the girls), amusement and opportunity for mayhem (most of the boys)...   result:   people running around the classroom, collecting fugitive stick insects (myself not included - i didn't want to touch them...); boys picking up stick insects and putting them anywhere they thought would result in screaming (e.g. girls' heads; girls' backs; girls' chairs; girls' pencilcases; girls' bags...you see the pattern here...?)   conclusion:   a whole lesson spent in complete chaos (you'd have thought they were some kind of rare, exotic, and dangerous creatures, instead of stick-like creatures that aren't likely to bite, or attack anyone - unless provoked, perhaps...? ;-)...and one less hour of studying leaves or something equally as boring under a microscope, or growing weird and unspecified bacteria on petri dishes... a bizarre memory, indeed. :-)

(though i'm not entirely sure what the worm represents here...it certainly ain't a job...there aren't any of  those  around here...or none that i'd want to do, anyway...) so avoidance tactics are coming into place...the first one being: tidying my bedroom; clearing out old paperwork, clothes i no longer wear, and general junk that i don't need cluttering up my life; rearranging things that really don't need to be rearranged... and yes, i hold my hands up now, and admit i'm something of a fool for giving up a job that paid six pounds fifty pence an hour without having another job to go to... but i really couldn't have stayed there any longer...so i'm not going to start feeling sorry for myself now... what's done is done...and i still don't feel that i made the wrong decision...

      currently listening to:  jet -  last chance    "...you ain't nothin' to me, if you've got nothin' to say..."   one thing you need to understand about me, is the fact that i often suffer from  the rose-tinted spectacles syndrome ... no matter how traumatic; embarrassing; upsetting; boring; pathetic; or sad a situation has been - after a given amount of time, i will most likely be heard saying something to the tune of "oh, those were the days, eh...?" or "i do miss x,y, and z..." so, today, for example:  1) i saw an ex-boyfriend of mine, who i shall refer to as matt (since that is actually his name...), with his current girlfriend and child (who walked and talked, and told a passer-by to "shut up")...this was the first time i've seen matt since we broke up several years ago...but i think (or hope) that i hid my unease at seeing him again after all this time...i also hope i managed to mask the slight jealousy that he's now a father to someone else's child...now, this relationship was far from the best i've ever had, but this is where  the rose-tinted spectacles syndrome  comes in...because i saw him, and for a brief moment, i thought to myself "ah, i do miss him...those were some good times we had"...now, this is not strictly true, but it did have it's moments, and maybe it was just all the good parts that i wanted back...who knows?...because now that i actually sit and think about it, i wouldn't like to be the mother of his child...but that's another story.  2) i received a text message from my friend, and ex-workmate, julie...my phone beep-beeped at me, as i sat on a wall outside the job centre, smoking a cigarette, and waiting for 11 a.m. so i could go in and sign my name on the dotted line for (hopefully) the last time...anyway, i digress...the message was that the girl who got my job after i left it in january, is being "gotten rid of" because nobody likes her, and would i be at all interested in having my old job back...?  now, a) this made me feel good, because at least they liked me, and didn't want me to leave, and b) i got  the rose-tinted spectacles syndrome  again...for a moment, i sat there on that wall, smoking that cigarette, and wondered to myself..."should i go back...?  it was good money...there were plenty of laughs to be had...i got away with murder there..." (well, not literally, you understand)...and then i remembered all the times when i cursed that place; said i hated it; said it was the most boring job ever; and so on.  so, the curse of the rose-tinted spectacles hit me again...and i don't think it'll be the last time either.  p.s.  monkey  [see last blog entry] is nowhere near as laugh-out-loud funny when you're watching it alone...

Use the  third letter of your first name  to determine your new first name: a = poopsie           b = lumpy c = buttercup      d = gadget e = crusty            f = greasy g = fluffy            h = cheeseball i = chim-chim        j = stinky k = flunky            l = boobie m = pinky             n = zippy o = goober            p = doofus q = slimy              r = loopy s = snotty             t = tootie u = dorkey            v = squeezit w = oprah             x = skipper y = dinky              z = zsa-zsa  Use the  second letter of your last name  to determine the first half of your new last name: a = apple        b = toilet c = giggle       d = burger e = girdle       f = barf g = lizard       h = waffle i = cootie       j = monkey k = potty       l = liver m = banana      n = rhino o = bubble      p = hamster q = toad         r = gizzard s = pizza         t = gerbil u = chicken      v = pickle w = chuckle      x = tofu y = gorilla       z = stinker  Use the  fourth letter of your last name  to determine the second half of your new last name: a = head             b = mouth c = face             d = nose e = tush             f = breath g = pants            h = shorts i = lips               j = honker k = butt              l = brain m = tushie            n = chunks o = hiney             p = biscuits q = toes              r = buns s = fanny             t = sniffer u = sprinkles          v = kisser w = squirt             x = humperdinck y = brains             z = juice  Thus, for example, George W.

      currently listening to:  athlete -  el salvador    "...not seen my friends in ages, have i been left behind?..."   okay, i just want to clear up the whole "gypsy" situation here... when i say gypsies i mean travellers...groups of people who travel around the country in their caravans... families with many dogs and even more children... usually irish (think of brad pitt's character in  urlLink  snatch  , if you've seen that film...and say what you like about brad's dubious accents in other films, but he has that accent pretty much perfect i.e. irish, but you can't understand a frickin' word he says) travellers; gypsies; gypos; pikeys...call 'em what you like... (but not romanies, caroline, that would be much too romantic for this area...) ;-) they cause trouble; they love fighting and arguing; they steal... they show up a couple of times a year...find any piece of grassland they can, and set up home for awhile...sending their kids out to steal from shops, etc... they're just best avoided really... maybe the closest american equivalent would be "trailer trash"...except these people move around like nomads... and they don't appear on  the jerry springer show  to talk about how they got their sister pregnant, or want to marry a donkey... :-)

      currently listening to:  elbow -  red    "...this can't go on too long, you're a tragedy starting to happen..."   last year (i don't remember the exact month), a boy was kicked to death in a dodgy area of my town... he was only eleven, or maybe twelve, years old...and the two boys who attacked him weren't much older than that... he was a traveller...a gypsy... he'd come over here from liverpool to visit a friend, got into an argument with a couple of boys, and died on a field after having his head kicked in... today i drove past the field where he died, and was quite surprised to see that people are still putting flowers there...and coloured ribbons... a memorial to a tragedy... now, i must admit, i don't like gypsies...they steal...they cause trouble wherever they go...they put 'curses' on you when you don't buy withered pieces of 'lucky' heather from them... but they are still human beings...they don't deserve to be kicked to death when they only wanted to kick a soccer ball around with a friend... and now the fair is back in town...which inevitably means the town will be overrun with gypsies once again... but i might buy a piece of lucky heather this time...i've had enough curses put on me in the past...i could use some luck... and maybe, in some twisted way, i feel the need to make my own contribution to apologising for what happened to that boy in my hometown... but i have a sneaking suspicion that, even if i did buy a piece of lucky heather from an old gypsy woman, i'd get an unlucky piece instead...or she'd still go ahead and curse me anyway...just for the sheer hell of it... ;-)

(she was referring to me...and my own plans to fly the nest...)  the ties that bind are often stronger than we realise...  and it made me kind of sad to think of it...to think that it'll soon be time for me to fly again (we've all flown, and returned intermittently)... but not so sad that i'm having second thoughts, or getting cold feet about it all...(though i do have issues that need to be resolved first...) i think i need to stretch my wings again...and prepare for flight...  because i know that the nest is always going to be here for me...always willing to take the baby bird back into the bosom of the family...

An adorable little girl, all blonde curls and blue eyes, walks into a pet shop and asks in the sweetest little lisp:   "Excuthe me, mithter, do you keep widdle wabbits?"  The shopkeeper's heart melts and he gets down on his knees, so that he's on her level, and asks:   "Do you want a widdle white wabby or a thoft and fuwwy bwack wabby or maybe one like that cute widdle bwown wabby over there?"  She, blushing, rocks on her heels, puts her hands on her knees, leans forward and says in a quiet voice:  "I don't fink my python weally gives a phuck."

      currently listening to:  rolling stones -  (i can't get no) satisfaction    "...i can't get no satisfaction, 'cause i try and i try and i try and i try..."   okay, because i can laugh at my own mistakes and general foolishness, i don't mind telling you about the  mock driving test  i had this morning... and  failed , by the way...but i know you'd have figured that out already... so, it was with a different instructor (who only looked about 12 years old, but he was nice...) and in a different car... i was fine about driving with someone new, but i wasn't fine about the car... it felt weirder, and older, and harder to handle... (don't get me wrong, i'm not using that as an excuse...but i don't think it helped me a whole lot...) anyway, in the end i had  12 minor faults  (you're allowed a maximum of 15), but  2 serious faults ... namely that: 1) i accidentally went into fourth gear at a roundabout, instead of second (i do blame the car for that one...the gears felt so different!)  and   2) i was on a one-way street, so i should have been in  the right-hand lane to turn right , instead of the left-hand lane (but i hadn't realised it  was  a one-way...i take full responsibility for that though, i *should* have noticed!) so there you have it...i failed the mock...twice... but it was a really useful experience...i laughed it off...it hasn't knocked my confidence...and he did say that he can see i'm at driving-test standard...it was just the luck of the draw... better luck next time... my usual instructor will probably kill me before i get the chance though... ;-)

"what in the name of all that is sacred / holyâ¦?"  so, i guess if i  was  a god-fearing person, i'd be constantly "taking the lord's name in vain"... and i wonder how i managed to gain such vocabularyâ¦bloody hell, that's kinda scaryâ¦(see, i said it again!)... and did you notice what i'm listening to at the moment...?! i'm likely to be hit by a giant thunderbolt sent down from heaven at any time for being such an evil child of god...! (and i'm truly sorry if i'm offending anybody...it's really not my intention, okay?)  and please,  for the love of god , somebody please stop me (or at least leave a comment) from posting stupid lists on my  urlLink fugitive motel  blog  (a.k.a There's Something About Angela...) because i've posted seven times on that thing today, and i'm becoming seriously concerned about my own mental health and wellbeing... *twitch* *twitch* *mutter* *mutter* *twitch*... ;-)

      currently listening to:  athlete -  vehicles and animals    "...and there's no need for us to go back in time..."   my sister just sent me this...it made me laugh, so i want to share it with you...  True Friendship  Are you tired of all those mushy "friendship" poems that always sound good but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a "friendship" poem that really speaks to true friendship and truth itself!  Friend,  When you are sad... I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge against the sorry bast**d who made you sad. When you are blue... I'll try to dislodge whatever is choking you. When you smile... I'll know you finally got a sh*g. When you are scared... I will take the p**s every chance I get. When you are worried... I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to shut up. When you are confused... I will use little words to explain it to you. When you are sick.. stay away from me until you're well again. I don't want to catch it. When you fall... I will point and laugh at you. This is my oath... I pledge till the end. Why you may ask? Because you're my friend!  Send this poem to five of your friends or else you will get depressed because you realise you only have two friends, and one of them is not speaking to you right now anyway.  P.S. A friend will help you move house. A really good friend will help you move a body.

Your Zodiac Angel for 6th January:  Your Guardian Angel is the Angel of Tenacity - he helps people obtain wisdom and knowledge.   You have a logical and rational way of going about your business and no matter how many hurdles you must overcome, you rarely get discouraged. There is a quiet ambition to your nature that helps you achieve much. You are fair and impartial in your dealings and you relish a challenge. With the help of your Zodiac Angel, you will climb great heights of success.   i don't know if i believe in such things really, but since my name is angela, i'll keep an open mind...  and i  do  like  urlLink  it's a wonderful life  ... "everytime a bell rings, an angel gets his wings..."  awww,  bless ... :-)

      currently listening to:  the thrills -  santa cruz (you're not that far)    "...well, tell me where it all went wrong..."   well, here we are in march already...time seems to be going by so quickly... my mum always told me that the years go by quicker the older you get, and i'm just starting to believe her... i'm also appreciating how easy-going my parents were during my teenage-rebellion years (a bit late to realise this, i know...but better late than never...) i think this train of thought stemmed from yesterday's conversation with my good friend, nicki... you see, her parents are positively victorian in their attitudes, opinions, and general outlook on life (and religious too, but i still won't tar all religious people with the same brush...) so nicki and her twin sister, becky, keep a hell of a lot of secrets from their folks... thus, they both have to keep their tattoos covered at all times (and in all weather) so the parents won't find out they have about eight tattoos between them... (actually, becky  is  a tattoo artist...and a very good one too...but her mum and dad think she just works in a shop!) and nicki will never be able to tell her folks that she's gay, because they have already made their views on homosexuality perfectly clear... oh, did i mention that they are 28 years old...?  and still living in fear of their parents finding out things that would shock the living daylights out of them... so, i now realise how lucky i am to have parents that are relatively easy-going and understanding... they never even batted an eyelid when i came home with my nose pierced; or minded that i got tattoos (my dad even said i should go back and get my gecko lizard coloured in, but i wanted it kept black and grey...); and they have never said a word about me quitting college courses, or jobs, or anything else... they don't seem to mind that i'm something of a drifter (or waste of space, if you want to look at it that way!)... i think they just want me to be happy in whatever i do, and wherever i go... i really should thank them for being such good parents...and apologise for being a bad daughter when i was a teenager... :-)

      currently listening to:  the cult -  lil' devil    "...come on little devil, be my little angel..."   i'm totally re-living some childhood memories today... it all stemmed from going over to "borrow" some CDs from my big brother... i wanted to see if he had anything new that i could borrow and copy... but, after a thorough search through his mountains of CDs, i found some cool old stuff instead... not long ago, somebody asked me who my first crush was, and at the time i couldn't remember... but, jeez, how could i have forgotten the crush i had on  urlLink Ian Astbury  from  urlLink The Cult ...! i remember that my brother (who's 7 years older than me) had a poster of Ian Astbury on his bedroom wall (this would be during the late 1980's, so i must have been 8 or 9 years old) and i just fell in love with that poster...and, consequently, rock music too... so, my "unusual" taste in both men and music started at quite an early age... and my brother is to be held completely responsible for it... ;-) (p.s. for your added information, i truly believe that  Wild Flower  by The Cult is one of the best songs in the world...ever...)

      currently listening to:  travis -  driftwood    "...home is where the heart is, but your heart had to roam..."   i've become quite lazy in keeping up with  what's going on in the world  these days... i no longer watch the news on tv (my excuse being that it's too depressing...the reality being that i just can't be bothered to watch it...) i was never a daily newspaper reader - more of an "oh well, if i'm near a newsagents in the morning, and i'm going for cigarettes anyway, then i might just buy a paper too" kind of reader - but even  that  seems to have ceased completely... and, even though the bbc news website is my current homepage and i'm on the internet pretty frequently, i don't even read 'the serious' news on there anymore - i just scan it, occasionally read things that i think i should read (but not often), and always look for the comedy/weird/novelty type news items instead... so, i don't know what's going on in the world - outside of my own front door; or further afield... i hear the occasional thing, obviously, because i don't live inside a bubble... but i know less than i probably  should  know, and understand even less of it... but (and here comes my point), it feels quite good this way...i feel less cynical about the world...i feel less pessimistic about humanity...i feel less depressed about the state of the national health service; or the education system in this country...i feel less stupid for not understanding exactly  why  country X is fighting with country Y... although, this is probably not the ideal situation - i might start living in cloud cuckoo land, and refusing to believe that men rape women; mothers murder their children; creepy old men force little children to perform sexual acts; men go to war, and die for their countries; teenage girls get abducted, never to be seen (alive) again; people blow themselves up in crowded places, all in the name of Allah, or whichever god they believe in; planes fall out of the sky, and kill everyone on board; houses get broken into; cars get stolen; old ladies get beaten up in their own homes; gang members shoot rival gang members; towns suffer floods; children in third-world countries starve to death; people die of heroin overdoses; drunk-drivers hit school children; etc, etc, etc, etc...  sometimes, ignorance truly is bliss...

(and that's a question that i want no-one to answer...!) 3) why do i claim to hate them, yet own so many...? 4) why did i never know that the answer to my snobbish "oh god, does anybody  actually  buy these lame greatest hits albums?" question has, in fact, always been "Angela buys them.  She just doesn't like to admit to it." 5) i'm now concerned about my own mental health (not to mention my taste in music...) 6) i think i need psychiatric help... *twitch*  well, while i'm here committing social and musical suicide, i might as well admit to also owning:  The Wizard of Oz  soundtrack; the  O, Brother, Where Art Thou?  soundtrack; and  Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds  (but i'm not ashamed of that one, 'cause it's too cool...)    somebody help me...please, for the love of god, help me...   ;-)

(if i had Â£1 for every time i've been asked that question in the past year, i'd be so rich i wouldn't  need  to "do" anything...) but,  why  should i need to do anything...?  so, yeah, okay...i've got a good degree; i'm reasonably intelligent (*snigger*); and the world should be my oyster... but dammit, i don't want to grow up...i want to be a drifter; a layabout; a free spirit... and i want my entire life to be a gap year...who the hell  doesn't  want that...?

      currently listening to:  rush -  working man    "...well i get up at seven, yeah, and i go to work at nine, i got no time for livin', yes, i'm workin' all the time..."   this amused me, but i had to cut and paste it for you, 'cause the link didn't work when i tried that approach:  "After making waves playing angst-ridden teen queens in films like  The Breakfast Club  and  Pretty in Pink ,  Molly Ringwald  disappeared off the celebrity radar, saying that she needed to decompress from her movie star life. She moved to France, got married, got divorced and is now happy with her boyfriend and baby. Now 36, she has kept her hand in the movie business and has a couple of small roles lined up.   Corey Feldman  also took the route from child star to obscurity. Following roles in  The Goonies  and  Stand By Me , his fortunes took a downturn when he was arrested for heroin possession in 1990. His subsequent music career made no waves - the three rock-pop albums he released were slated. Today, he is still making movies of minor note and pushing his music career.  Nearly two decades ago, a flame-haired teen sensation drew huge crowds to her Shopping Mall Tour in '87 and sold four million copies of her debut album, before disappearing out of the limelight. Now  Tiffany  Darwish is 32 and a mother of one. Speaking of her long exile from showbiz, she said: 'I didn't have anything to say except 'I'm doing the dishes and taking my son to school', although in 2000, she did make a bit of a comeback with her album  The Colour Of Silence .  Blonde bombshell  Anneka Rice , who possessed the best known bum in her '80s hey-day, is remembered most for jumping in and out of helicopters for Channel 4's  Treasure Hunt  and completing timed charitable projects for the BBC's  Challenge Anneka . These days, you are more likely to find her on the American Network ABC, where she co-produced a similar show called  Challenge America  which aimed to help rebuild New York after 9/11.  Yet another '80s wonder: this time  Alex Winter . As star of  The Lost Boys  and  Bill And Ted , he showed immense potential but ended up shunning the Hollywood machine, (which co-star Keanu used to such good effect) and focused on directing. Now 37, he makes indie films and commercials at his own production company, Hyena Films. 'This,' he says, 'is what I've always wanted to do'.  We know him as the vertically-challenged Arnold Jackson from  Diff'rent Strokes , but since then  Gary Coleman  has experienced a major downslide. In the '90s, he successfully sued his foster parents for misappropriating his millions, twice attempted suicide with sleeping pills and appeared in court for punching a fan in the head. Recent doings? He appeared in Moby's  We Are All Made Of Stars  video and ran in last year's election for the governor of California won by Arnie Schwarzenegger.  At his '80s height, he was the biggest-selling artist in Europe. But fame is fickle and  Jason Donovan  fell headlong onto the slippery slope of has-been, losing a televised busking contest to a Jack Russell dog when he was at his lowest. His career has taken a much healthier turn more recently with a recent appearance as Caractacus Potts in  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang  in London's West End.  The good-looking one out of Take That (who incidentally was revealed by a Channel 4 documentary to have had a thing with Lulu),  Jason Orange , couldn't quite emulate the phenomenal success he enjoyed as part of one of the biggest boy bands ever. Leaving music behind, he embarked on an acting career which turned out to be none too distinguished. Today, he clings to the edges of showbiz and hangs out at the trendy Met Bar with other members of the acting fraternity.  For someone who achieved dizzying overnight success,  Rick Astley , the British clean-cut soul boy, soon disappeared from the celebrity treadmill amidst rumours that he couldn't handle the fame. After being out of the public eye for eight years, he released his comeback album,  Keep It On  in 2002.  Remember  Vanilla Ice ? During the '80s, he filled the white rapper slot before Eminem appeared on the scene. He reached his peak with  Ice Ice Baby , but his subsequent records failed to make the grade and he never managed to top his only hit song whose catchiness was in fact based on a riff taken from another tune - Bowie's  Under Pressure . Now 35, he's happy to ply his trade for curiosity seekers at downtown pubs in America.  Before boy bands became ten-a-penny, the original popsters New Kids On The Block caused a sensation on both sides of the pond. Lead  Jordan Knight  saw un-dreamed of success that set the mould for groups such as N-Sync. Today, Jordan is working on a comeback album and has just released the single  Don't Cry .  Danish sensation  Whigfield  who scored a success with the annoyingly catchy dance track  Saturday Night , was dropped by her record label who didn't think they were going to be anything but one-hit wonders. Despite this blow, she has worked ever since, enjoying success in Europe and South Africa and has now recorded her fifth album."   so...we can all sleep more soundly at night..and don't need to keep asking ourselves "whatever happened to Vanilla Ice...?" 'cause we now know... ;-)

      currently listening to:  marillion -  that time of the night    "...paranoia roams where the shadows reign, at that time of the night..."   i've got quite a bit to say today...  firstly, why do i often get asked if i want kids...? this question bugs me on a few different levels: 1) it's quite a personal question - how does the asker (and it's mostly men, for some reason...) know that i'm not infertile; or that it's a touchy subject 'cause i've had an abortion or a miscarriage...(none of these apply in my case...but the point is  they don't know that  when they ask...) 2) it makes me feel like i'm getting old or something - just because approx. 85% of the girls i went to school with now have kids who go to school themselves, doesn't mean that i have to be a mother of four by the age of 25... 3)  why the hell do they care anyway ...? maybe i'm just over-analysing it - it's a distinct possiblilty...but even so, i just think it's an odd question for me to be asked on a fairly regular basis...  secondly, i've had such a horrible day at work today... i'm being moved around all this week, like a nomad, because i have no-one to work with me in my little shop until they find someone... my friend, Julie, was supposed to be coming to work with me, but that plan has gone pear-shaped...she's decided to stay in our old place (which we both hated with a burning passion...) *sigh* so, today i was in the Ark shop (which i didn't like too much...) and i'll be in there again on wednesday... then on friday i'll be in the Fountain shop (which i don't like too much...) and then, at the weekend ( and i've lost my sunday off work, too...and i had plans, godammit...! ) i'll be back in the safety of my little Arara shop, next to the chimps and the orangutans ( my boyfriend will be thinking i've run off and left him ...) but i'm sorry, i don't know why i'm telling you all of this, 'cause you probably haven't even  been  to chester zoo...) so, i'm not going to bore you anymore with the rest of the misery of today...(and believe me, there was plenty of misery...)  thirdly, my sister e-mailed me a picture of my brother's smashed-up car... and it's worse than i thought... curse her for sending me that the day before i take my frickin' driving test...it doesn't exactly instill me with confidence...  which leads me nicely to my fourth (and maybe final?) point - i'm starting to feel kinda nervous about the test tomorrow... i've been told to stay confident; be optimistic; and to try and see it as a "fun thing"... i've also been told that if it should all start to go wrong, i should drive into the river dee (or the river mersey, whichever i'm closest too at the time) and make my escape by canoe... so, really useful advice, but i'm still kinda nervous... probably because they call it "a test" rather than a "hey, this guy wants you to drive around for awhile, so he can see how good you are, and then he might give you a proper licence, okay?" (calling something a test, or an exam, always makes my knees knock...and makes me doubt my own ability...)   wish me luck...

      currently listening to:  talking heads -  burning down the house    "...watch out, you might get what you're after..."   just 'cause reading this managed to make me smile...even after the horrible day i've had at the zoo...  Questions about love, marriage and sex were posed to kids ages 5 to 10. Their answers below are enlightening:  WHAT IS THE PROPER AGE TO GET MARRIED? ---------- "Eighty-four! Because at that age, you don't have to work anymore, and you can spend all your time loving each other in your bedroom." (Judy, 8) "Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find me a wife!" (Tom, 5)  WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE? ---------- "On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date."

(Jeanne, 8) "It isn't always just how you look. Look at me. I'm handsome like anything and I haven't got anybody to marry me yet." (Gary, 7) "Beauty is skin deep. But how rich you are can last a long time." (Christine, 9)  CONCERNING WHY LOVERS OFTEN HOLD HANDS: ---------- "They want to make sure their rings don't fall off because they paid good money for them." (Dave, 8)  CONFIDENTIAL OPINIONS ABOUT LOVE: ---------- "I'm in favor of love as long as it doesn't happen when 'The Simpsons' is on television." (Anita, 6) "Love will find you, even if you are trying to hide from it. I have been trying to hide from it since I was five, but the girls keep finding me." (Bobby, 8) "I'm not rushing into being in love. I'm finding fourth grade hard enough."

Diet Coke are currently running a "vote for your favourite film" thing... and i've just peeled the label off a bottle to see what the top 50 options to choose from are... but i just cannot decide which one i'd choose... if somebody held a gun to my head, and  forced me  to choose one film, i'd probably be dead by now... that's how bad i am at making small, insignificant  it-really-doesn't-matter-just-frickin'-pick-one  decisions... anyway,   urlLink here  is the link... and here's me typing them all out, just 'cause i'm not tired enough to go to sleep just yet:  1) The Great Escape 2) Terminator 2: Judgment Day 3) Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark 4) Top Gun 5) Rocky 6) L.A.

(gee, that makes me sound such fun...!) what i mean is, i've never been one to open up completely to people...i keep my feelings inside...i put up barriers and defences to avoid being hurt (but i  do  get hurt nevertheless...i just won't  show  it...) and as much as i might want to tell someone what is really wrong with me (if there  is  something wrong with me, that is) i rarely will... i bottle up all of my emotions and feelings and thoughts and fears and hopes and dreams and ideas...i'll bottle them all up inside, until i'm just about ready to explode...and i know that this is not good for me...i know this is very stupid...i know it, but i can't help it... i think too much; i worry too much; i am too hard on myself; i am too hard on people around me (by putting up my barriers and self-defence mechanisms)... and i want to change...i really do... (i apologise for the recent tone and content of my blog entries, but i'm kinda treating it as a form of therapy, or a personal diary at the moment, in the hope that it will make sense as i read it back to myself...and who knows?  perhaps one day soon i'll gain a sense of perspective...because at the moment, i seem to have lost that...)

      currently listening to:  elbow -  ribcage    "...i wanted to explode, to pull my ribs apart, and let the sun inside..."   do you ever feel like your life is upside-down?  inside-out?  back-to-front?  muddled?  confused?  going nowhere...? well, that's  exactly  how i'm feeling right now... i'm so  restless ...i want  something  to happen...i want to be  spontaneous ...i want to  go  places, and  do  things, and  see  people, and  be somebody ... and i hate feeling this way...i don't know why i'm like this, but people are noticing my restlessness, my twitchiness, my nervous energy, my lack of interest in the day-to-day banality of my own life (and, yes, that  definitely  includes work...) i'm bored, and fed-up, and looking for ways out...looking for the  answers  when i don't even know the  questions ... and i just want to  settle ...to feel  calm ...to feel  serene , and  content , and  happy , and  wanted , and  loved , and  satisfied ...to say "yeah, life doesn't get much better than this, it really doesn't..." what can i do?  how can i stop myself from feeling this way?  how can i be at peace with myself? how can i stop fretting, and worrying about what the future may hold, when none of us can ever know that?  someone...please...tell me where the exit is...

      currently listening to:  richard ashcroft -  new york    "...are you tuning in?..."   i've just watched  Freddy Got Fingered ...it's been a long time since i laughed so hard... :-) tomorrow is my day off work, and i'll either be doing  something or nothing ...i haven't quite decided yet... although, if my mum gets her way, i'll be doing something boring and housework-like for her... which brings me to this: I WANT TO MOVE OUT! I WANT TO MOVE OUT! I WANT TO MOVE OUT! i'm too frickin' old to still be living with my parents, with no immediate hope of escape... *sigh* yeah, okay, there  are  advantages to living at home, but at the moment they are being far outweighed by the disadvantages (of which there are many...) i also feel like i'm working for nothing, since my money has a nasty and unfortunate habit of disappearing pretty quickly...and i've got nothing to show for it... oh well, time for some organising of my own life, i think...nothing drastic, just a little tweaking here and there... phase one:  stop spending money on random crap that i don't even need ...

      currently listening to:  yes -  siberian khatru    "...sing bird of prey, beauty begins at the foot of you..."   it was just my luck today, that each and every time i went out of the fire exit door of the shop to smoke a quick cigarette, i was seen by a senior member of staff... oh well, they can fire me if they like... anyway, today was busy, but not as busy as i had expected it to be, especially considering this freakishly nice (but very un-British) weather we're having... it was too glorious outside to be stuck inside a tiny shop, dealing with hot and grumpy customers all day, and trying to stop the accursed gypsies from stealing things, but at least i didn't get chance to burn my pale skin to the shade of an angry lobster... ;-)

      currently listening to:  i am kloot -  untitled # 1    "...say you're like a tree or a bus stop, with your hands by your side, let's say you're like a field of tulips, cheap gold flowers in the sky..."   well, i'd like to say that the nice weather has made me feel uplifted and happy, but i would (unfortunately) be lying... i don't know what the hell is wrong with me this week, but i've just felt so damn miserable... nothing bad has happened to make me feel this way, and i'm hoping it's just a temporary mood... but, still...i hate feeling like this...when i get this way (and, thankfully, it's not very often) i usually end up making some kind of rash decision... for example, i've quit jobs when i've felt this way...i've dropped out of college courses...i've lay awake at night, staring at the ceiling, and thinking about my life, and my situation, and  what i want ...i've felt trapped, and looked for an escape route... so, i don't know what (or even  if ) my current mood is going to make me lie in bed tonight, unable to sleep, thinking about my life, and what i want to do, and how i can change things... but i hope not, 'cause my life really is okay at the moment (not  great , but not  bad  by any means...) and i really don't want to start making any middle-of-the-night decisions...'cause once i've made my mind up about something, i usually act on it, even in the cold light of day when things don't ever seem as bad... anyway, despite my weird and inexplicable mood, it's still great to see the sun, and feel warm, and walk home in a t-shirt, with the sweater that i needed this morning tied around my waist... and this mood will pass, i know it will...and all will be good again...

      currently listening to:  franz ferdinand -  michael    "...i'm all that you see, you want to see, come and dance with me michael..."   since my very first blog entry (way back in July 2003) i've given you the soundtrack to Angela's life.  or maybe not my  soundtrack , as such. but i've always told you what i'm listening to when i start writing each entry.  and then, in February 2004 (the 11th, to be exact. i've checked), i started adding some lyrics from my 'currently listening to' choice directly underneath the artist and song title. and i've often been struck by how apt those lyrics have been at that time. that moment. that feeling. those thoughts.  to Angela at that particular moment in time . at other times, they've had little to no meaning at all. just words. just the most memorable lyrics. or just the only lines i could decipher well enough to copy ('cause you might check. and i would look stupid if i'm wrong.)  the point is, sometimes a song can reveal a thousand thoughts and feelings. they can tell you things about me that i'm not telling you myself. if you looked hard enough. if you looked at all. you might see something i didn't mean to reveal. or maybe not. 'cause i actually don't expect you to even look at who, what, or why, i'm listening to that particular song at that particular moment. but maybe now you will.  and maybe you'll wonder what's bubbling away under the surface. and maybe you'll try to work me out.  or maybe you just won't care...(and i wouldn't blame you if you didn't)...it's only a song, after all...right?    "...i can imagine the moment, breaking out through the silence, all the things that we both might say..."  "...stumble through the crowds together, they're trying to ignore us, but that's okay..."  "...don't try to believe in anyone, for i will change your mind..."  "...this can't go on too long, you're a tragedy starting to happen..."  "...nothing could bring me closer, nothing could bring me nearer, where is the road i follow?..."  "...sometimes you hold the world in your hands, sometimes the world it baffles you with plans..."  "...i'm gonna keep catching that butterfly, in that dream of mine..."  "...and i'm a million different people, from one day to the next..."  "...and a sense of coldness detaches as it tries to comfort your sadness..."  "...you need some time alone, i need to stop before i fall..."  "...is this making sense? what am i trying to say?..."  "...i wanted to explode, to pull my ribs apart, and let the sun inside..."  "...you start a conversation, you can't even finish it, you're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything..."  "...and when we spoke, there was silence, 'cause there's no need to make a sound, when you've got smiles instead..."  "...it's just a place i'm looking for..."  "...on a day like today, i looked at you and i, saw something in the way, you stared into the sky..."  "...you know i'm going to lose, and gambling's for fools, but that's the way i like it baby, i don't wanna live forever..."  "...well i don't know what i'm gonna be, everybody wants me to be free..."  "...nothing is ever the way it should be, what we deserve we just don't get you see..."  "...i am what i am, most motherfuckers don't give a damn..."  "...hey, could you stand another drink? i'm better when i don't think, seems to get me through..."  "...time just lingers on the wind, bristlinâ through my open fears, i wonder what itâs going to bring..."  "...and when the sunshine, throwinâ me a lifeline, finds itâs way into my room, all i need is you..."  "...i don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlight begins, it's all a mystery..."  "...any day now, how's about getting out of this place, anyways..."  "...oh and i don't have a soul to save, yes and i sin every single day..."

      currently listening to:  my dying bride -  like gods of the sun    "...you fill me up with dark thoughts of you, the devil talks to me when you're touching me, my lust it burns deep inside of you..."   ...at wasting time.  i think it could be my one true talent in life. my parents should be proud to have such a champion time-waster for a daughter. my brother and sister should feel jealous of their little sister - the time-waster. my friends should feel privileged to know me.  'cause i truly am the best when it comes to letting time slip through my fingers like the grains of sand through an hourglass. i've been awake for nearly seven hours. yet i only got dressed about two hours ago. i had a brain full of things i wanted and needed to do today. yet i've done nothing. nothing constructive anyway. and now it's gone 3 o'clock. still time for me to go out and get at least a couple of those things i wanted and needed to do today done. but i just can't see it happening. especially because, instead of getting off my ass and going out, i'm sitting here and blogging about how good i am at wasting time. it's not that i'm lazy (although god knows that i am lazy) it's just that i want to do things at my own pace on my days off. i want to be my own boss on these days. and judging by this, i'd make a terrible [or excellent, depending on which way you wanna look at it] boss. oh well... if i make a move right now, i could probably catch the next bus into town. but i wanna smoke a cigarette first. and maybe make my bed. and brush my teeth. and put some make-up on so i don't scare people when i go out. and i need to find my shoes. and where did i put my umbrella? and i wonder if i'm missing anything good on television... you see? you see how easy it is to waste time in Angela's world? *sigh*

This unfortunate incident occurred in a slightly distressed Buick Skylark in Las Calamas, CA.  The deceased was reported to have shouted "Not my new shirt!" just before expiring.  Angela is survived by four sisters and a mule.  Funeral services will be held the 2nd of next month.   (wow, a whole four months between death and burial/cremation?  i'm gonna smell  bad  by then...)

      currently listening to:  slipknot -  duality    "...(i push my fingers into my) eyes, it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache..."   i can't even begin to tell you how much i wanted to just runaway from work today. suffice to say it wasn't the best day's work (if there can be such a thing) i've ever had. and not a word of thanks for all my efforts either. but i suppose being paid is thanks enough. maybe? anyway, i'm feeling a lot more positive about things now. the self-destruct mood didn't materialise after all.  ok, so i'm twenty-five and still living at home. but it's my only option for the time being, so i should stop worrying about it and see the advantages of it instead.  and yes, i've got a degree and choose to work in a shop at the zoo. but that won't last forever (i'll be unemployed by the end of the year) and the world can be my oyster if i want it to be. and yeah, there are many things i'd like to change/obtain/do/see/experience/be, but i am still young. and there can't be many people in this world who don't feel the same way about themselves from time to time. and there are people worse off than me.  i shouldn't ever forget that . oh, listen to me! pay no attention to my ramblings. just know that i'm smiling a lot these days. and i'm happier than i have been in a long time :-) and i did try to care that england got knocked out of euro 2004. i really did. but it seems that years of conditioning by my scottish family (especially my dad) have finally paid off. and i'm not as english as i sometimes think i am. still, it would have been great for us/them* to win something. but, what will be will be.  *depending on whether i ultimately class myself as being english or scottish. maybe i'll never settle that one...

(what planet am i living on?) so, just to make me see the error of my ways, i'm gonna tell you all what i bought. and hopefully, seeing it all in print (so to speak) will make me feel so ashamed of myself that i'll learn to spend less. much less. much, much less.

      currently listening to:  rage against the machine -  bombtrack    "...burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn..."    urlLink     i used to think that i liked chimpanzees. if you'd asked me a few months ago for a list of animals i liked, chimps would have been on that list. not at the top, admittedly, but they'd have been on there somewhere. but not now. no, not now. i don't like them anymore. it's been a slow and gradual progress into my dislike of chimps. it started with me not liking their big weird arses. i swear chimps didn't have arses like that when i was a kid visiting the zoo, 'cause i'm pretty sure i'd have noticed and laughed and said "mummy, why have those chimps got fuckin' weird arses?" (or words to that affect.) the next thing that lead to me disliking them was the noise that they make almost constantly throughout the day. fighting. screeching. squealing. and i can hear it all from the shop where i work (thankfully my view of them is blocked by some perfectly placed trees and bushes.) and sometimes they sound like a woman getting raped (not that i've stood by and listened to a woman getting raped, but you know what i mean, don't you? i imagine she would sound something like the damn chimps.) and they're bloody ugly too (well, okay, the little ones are cute, but they get ugly when they grow up); they look mean and nasty; they stare at me like they wanna kill me whenever i walk past them (or is that just me being paranoid?); they pick unmentionable things out of each other's huge weird arses (and their own) and eat it; they have the hands and fingers and fingernails of an old witch woman (not literally, you understand. i mean that they  look like  they have...)  and then i found out today that (apart from us humans) they are the only species of animal that kill for fun. they kill for fun. FOR FUN. and this is our closest genetic match in the animal kingdom. chimps. chimps, with their weird arses and an enjoyment of killing for killing's sake, are scarily similar to human beings. i've heard tales today of chimps murdering other animals. i won't go into details, 'cause it's not pleasant. and yes, i know it's all nature. but i don't like it. and i don't like chimps anymore. now, orangutans?  orangutans i like. and lemurs? i also like lemurs. but not chimps. no, i no longer consider myself a fan of chimpanzees. i'm done, don't worry, i'm not going to write about chimps for much longer. i'll just reiterate that I DON'T LIKE CHIMPS, and then i'm out of here...

      currently listening to:  david gray -  please forgive me    "...feels like lightning running through my veins, everytime i look at you..."   on my neverending quest to see everything there is to see at work, i went to see the meerkats, the new baby orangutan (awww, bless! and is it weird for me to feel broody?), and the rhinos today. i was actually more impressed with the rhinos than i had expected to be (there was very nearly some hot rhino sex action, but sadly the female was more interested in her food than her lover.) but i've been kinda subdued today. my thoughts have been with a friend who was attending a baby's funeral. and i can't find the right words... i never can .

      currently listening to:  red hot chili peppers -  suck my kiss    "...i am what i am, most motherfuckers don't give a damn..."    urlLink     isn't it strange how when you're trying  not  to think about a certain thing, you'll see things that  make  you think of it? so, here's me today, trying not to think about the Red Hot Chili Peppers goodness that's going on in Hyde Park tonight (which i'm clearly missing out on) and all day on the radio they've been playing Red Hot Chili Peppers songs.  the adverts at the top of this page are offering tickets for sale for (yes, you guessed it) Red Hot Chili Peppers, and searches related to RED HOT or CHILI PEPPERS (PSYCHO GIRLFRIEND is another related search option up there too, but i'll ignore that one!) in the staff canteen today they were selling chili con carne (i gave it a miss). and, what else? i'm sure there was more that made me think of the Red Hot Chili Peppers...unfortunately it wasn't naked men wearing white socks over their privates, that's for sure ;-) anyway, yeah, i'm very upset that i'm not there right now. i'll have to settle for listening to it live on Radio One. but it's just not the same, is it?  :-(

      currently listening to:  my dying bride -  here in the throat    "...thank god i wasted you, no longer will i fall, i will live again, your grasp on me has gone, your downfall and your end, at last my peace has come..."   every so often, i'll become just completely obsessed by a particular band or album. not all the time, luckily, or i'd drive my family mad by making them hear the same music over and over again. in the space of an average day i listen to probably four or five different albums, of different styles. 'cause i need that variety. but then sometimes i just wanna hear the same thing over and over and over again. today is one of those days. and i have listened to  urlLink this  more times than i care to admit to. and it's been fantastic 'cause i've been home alone for most of the day. so, no limit on the volume it's been played at :-) and i finally got round to cleaning my bedroom today too. it was becoming a serious health hazard, so i feel a lot better now that it's all clean and tidy again. just don't ask me how long it'll stay this way for ;-)

      currently listening to:  red hot chili peppers -  higher ground    "...iâm so darn glad he let me try it again, âcause my last time on earth i lived a whole world of sin..."   just because i, like  urlLink Kristian  (who i clearly copied this idea from), have too much time on my hands...     Choose a band/artist and answer only in song titles by that band.   are you male or female:  animal  describe yourself:  at my most beautiful  how do some people feel about you:  disappear  how do you feel about yourself:  she just wants to be  describe an ex boyfriend/girlfriend:  so fast, so numb  describe your current boyfriend/girlfriend:  hope  describe where you want to be:  the great beyond  describe what you want to be:  the wake-up bomb  describe how you live:  imitation of life  describe how you love:  talk about the passion  what makes you happy:  all the right friends  share a few words of wisdom:  it's the end of the world as we know it (and i feel fine)    and if you don't know which band i chose, i'm not going to tell you. so there.

      currently listening to:  red hot chili peppers -  fortune faded    "...come on god, do i seem bulletproof?..."   why, oh why, do i always feel like i've wasted my day off work? i should be making the most of it. doing  things  (whatever they might be.) going  places  (wherever they might be.) seeing  people  (whoever they might be.) i planned to go searching the local tattoo places for some ideas. some inspiration for what i can get done. but. yeah.  but ... i went out last night. so today i didn't get dressed until nearly 2 o'clock (and yes, i'm talking 2 o'clock in the afternoon.) and by the time i actually left the house, i really couldn't be bothered to look at tattoo designs. maybe on my next day off. or am i tempting fate by even thinking about it? anyway. i'm probably the only person in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and England (or whatever you choose to call this country) who watched neither the England v. Switzerland match nor Big Brother tonight. but i did watch  24  (my nerves can't take this. what's going to happen next?  urlLink Caroline , don't you dare answer that. it was a rhetorical question, okay?) and woohoo!  urlLink Lindsay  is blogging again. what's going on in Accrington these days, anyway? i attempted to download a polyphonic ringtone onto my new phone today (did i mention i had a new phone? ;-) )  but it has not worked. although they have charged me for it. Â£4.50 and no ringtone. excellent. truly excellent. tune in tomorrow for another exciting installment in the life of Angela. or not, as the case may be... but hey, i've got some new music to listen to. so i'm happy. :-)

      currently listening to:  iron maiden -  man on the edge    "...nothing is ever the way it should be, what we deserve we just don't get you see..."   no, seriously. i've got nothing. nothing to report.  nothing.  except some weird little red bumps on my arm (heat rash, presumably. or, hopefully.) and i bought a new pair of jeans. and a belt. and a pair of boots. and eye-liner. and i'm kinda tired, but okay, really. and i'm currently getting to grips with predictive texting on my new mobile phone (much quicker than my old method.) so, if u get a msg from me and it has some odd choice of words in it, blame my phone and not me. and that's about all. so, not quite nothing. it was something, after all. but not much...

      currently listening to:  motorhead -  ace of spades    "...you know i'm going to lose, and gambling's for fools, but that's the way i like it baby, i don't wanna live forever..."   my day off has gone so quickly, so i'm delaying going to bed for as long as i can. and, in case you are interested (though i don't know why the hell you would be, but i guess someone does read this crap, so i shall continue to write it) the day off consisted of:  being woken up at 10.30 a.m. by one of those annoying text messages that reads something like: "We have been trying to contact you. You have won a cash prize of up to eighty million pounds. Please call the following number to claim...calls cost Â£3478.57 per minute, minimum call length 3 days, 7 hours, and 38 minutes..." eh, i'm sure you know the ones. very annoying.  being generally quite slothful until about noon.  then finally showering and dressing; doing some washing (i.e. so i don't have to wear a dirty uniform tomorrow); eating some lunch.  being slothful for a little while longer.  having a driving lesson between 2.30 - 4.30 p.m. in a blisteringly hot car. what fun.  going shopping (because it's pay day, godammit!  what do you expect?!) and buying  urlLink this ,  urlLink this , and  urlLink this  (and i hate reading instruction books, so it's gonna take me awhile to figure out how to do everything.)  eating dinner; washing the dishes (can you see my halo yet?); annoying my mum by playing my music too loud (oops, i guess my halo slipped already); and watching the latest episode of  24  (poor ryan chappelle...)  and now i'm just sort of avoiding going to bed 'cause that means sleeping (which i love) but waking (which i don't love) and going to work (which i definitely don't love) and serving pain-in-the-ass customers (which i hate).  well, i'll shut up now, i think. g'night y'all :-)  (p.s. i just realised that i forgot to post my vote!  oh well...)

      currently listening to:  richard ashcroft -  a song for the lovers    "...something in the air tells me the time is right..."     &nbsp;  anyone who knows me at all will already know that i'm completely un-religious (or "non-religious"?).&nbsp; i've got no beliefs in that whole area at all.&nbsp; i don't believe in God; or Jesus; or Allah; or Buddha.   i believe that people are free to believe what they *want* to believe, as long as this is their own choice and not one that has been forced upon them.&nbsp; but, all in all,&nbsp;i have a  live and let live  attitude about religion.  (though i will never understand how such a holy thing as religion can cause so much pain and misery in this world...but i'm reluctant to open that can of worms here...)   my point is - i'm not a religious person.&nbsp; so, this leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions in life.&nbsp; and the one that seems to be the most difficult for me to deal with is the question of what is going to happen to me after&nbsp;i die.&nbsp; we're all going to die - that is inevitable - and i can just about cope with that.&nbsp; what concerns me slightly is what happens afterwards...   if all the good religious people are going to Heaven; and all the bad religious people are going to Hell...what about the rest of us?&nbsp; where are we going?&nbsp; where am  i  going?   i've spent twenty-five years believing that when you're dead, you're dead.&nbsp; The End.&nbsp; there is nothing else after that.&nbsp; you're gone.&nbsp; if you're lucky, you'll live on in the&nbsp;hearts and minds of those who loved you.&nbsp; but spiritually and physically, you're dead.&nbsp; there's no Heaven or Hell to go to.&nbsp; you're just dead, and that's that.   but lately i've been wondering about all that.&nbsp; because even though i don't believe that i am one of God's creations, i do believe that i have a soul...a spirit...an essence...the essence that is Angela, which merely lives inside this shell that is Angela's body.&nbsp; so, when that shell is broken what&nbsp;will happen to my spirit?&nbsp; will it merely fade away?&nbsp; or will it float away&nbsp;on&nbsp;a summer breeze?&nbsp; or will it explode into a million little dew drops?&nbsp; (i'm assuming that my spirit has some physical form, but i'm probably wrong about that&nbsp;- it's just easier to imagine it as vapour or a puff of smoke, or something.)&nbsp;   and i've decided&nbsp;that maybe - since i like stripy things so much and love rainbows - that i want my spirit to become a rainbow.&nbsp; and i know that sounds silly and childish, but it's what i'd like to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;my essence could shine out in a rainbow...something that people could see, if only for a couple of minutes.&nbsp; and yes, i know that rainbows are just a prism or whatever the hell it is (i actually, at the age of twenty-five, could not tell you exactly what a rainbow is - all i know is it's got something to do with prisms, and light refracted through something - and it's not that i'm stupid&nbsp;[although science was never my strongest subject] it's because  i&nbsp;don't want to know  precisely what a rainbow is.&nbsp; i just want to be able to see a rainbow as a beautiful sight.&nbsp; i don't want it to be a boring&nbsp;scientific thing.&nbsp; i don't ever want rainbows to lose their magic.&nbsp; a rainbow is a rainbow.&nbsp; so, don't ruin that for me by telling me it's a blah, blah, blah of science caused by a blah, blah, blah shining though a blah, blah, blah.&nbsp; i don't wanna know about that...)   but&nbsp;ultimately i hope that whatever you want to happen (after&nbsp;you draw your last breath and beat your last heartbeat) is what actually happens to you.&nbsp; so, if Joe in Edinburgh wants to go to Heaven - that's where he'll go and it'll be exactly what he wants it to be.&nbsp; and if Paul in New York wants to be reincarnated as a goldfish - that's what he'll be and i hope he'll merrily swim around in a nice fishbowl for&nbsp;many a year.&nbsp; and if Laura in Sydney wants to become a shining star in the night's sky - that's what she'll be (but&nbsp;Laura then&nbsp;faces the risk of being  urlLink "bought"  and named by some romantic bastard, and given to his long-suffering/loving wife, via a certificate and a vague map of the solar system, on their twenty-fifth wedding&nbsp;anniversary).   and me?&nbsp; i want to be a rainbow.&nbsp; a big, full one.&nbsp; not one of those little weak efforts you see sometimes.&nbsp; i want to be&nbsp;big and bright.&nbsp; and i want for my rainbow to make somebody smile when&nbsp;they look up at it.&nbsp; i hope it brings someone a little happiness and hope.&nbsp; and if there&nbsp;should be&nbsp;leprechauns and a big pot of gold waiting at the end of my rainbow, then so be it...but that's what i wanna be - a rainbow...    urlLink      (this is not the exact kind of rainbow i want to&nbsp;be...it was just the nicest picture of one that i could find, ok?)

      currently listening to:  badly drawn boy -  another devil dies     "...well, your face still makes my day, just like it did in the past..."     &nbsp;  i'm so tired of arguing with customers (read:  women ) about bringing pushchairs into our shop.&nbsp; the men are fine about it. as long as i smile at them and sweetly ask: "can you leave the pushchair outside, please?&nbsp; it's only a small shop, you see...thanks."&nbsp;they are totally ok about it.  but the women?&nbsp; jesus, the women.&nbsp; you'd think i was&nbsp;asking them to leave their limbs outside.&nbsp; the battles i've had in that place...   well, today i was not in the mood for it.&nbsp; so, i just let the stroppy little bitches come in with their huge&nbsp;[and usually empty, 'cause the kid&nbsp;has jumped out already and is&nbsp;pulling everything down from the shelves to play with] pushchairs. and watched as they struggled to get around the shop with all the other&nbsp;customers tripping over the stupid pushchair at every turn.&nbsp; anyway.&nbsp; it wasn't my problem today.&nbsp; i just stood there, draped over the till counter, and watched them get all hot and bothered.&nbsp; then, when they complained, i told 'em they were lucky i let them in at all, didn't they see the big sign outside?&nbsp; NO PUSHCHAIRS ALLOWED, YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKERS (well, that's what i *wish* i/it said...)   'cause i did not care today.&nbsp; no.&nbsp; no caring coming from my direction.&nbsp;  not even for the&nbsp;woman who had lost her digital camera. ("i only put it down on the grass for a minute, and when i went back it'd gone."&nbsp; this is england, sweetheart.&nbsp; people will steal *anything*, especially if you leave it lying around.)&nbsp;  or the kid who'd been stung by a wasp.&nbsp; (oh, get over it.&nbsp; you're acting like someone chopped your arm off.)  or the countless number of people who'd put Â£1 in the coke&nbsp;machine outside but hadn't got a drink. (well, have you tried kicking the machine?&nbsp; no?&nbsp; well, try that.&nbsp;&nbsp;but it's really nothing to do with me, sorry.)&nbsp;  or the woman whose kit-kat was all melted (not my problem - i don't sell kit-kats, love.&nbsp; you&nbsp;bought that from the cafe next door.&nbsp; so, don't be so lazy and take it back there to&nbsp;complain.&nbsp;&nbsp;oh, there's a big queue, huh?&nbsp; tough.&nbsp; not my problem.)&nbsp;&nbsp;  or the kid who brought back&nbsp;some damaged something-or-other toy-thing&nbsp;and wanted a refund.&nbsp; (no. you can have another one but i can't give you your money back.&nbsp; have you even got a receipt for that, anyway?&nbsp; and don't tell me you didn't get one...no-one leaves my shop without a goddamn receipt.)   well, by 2:30 i just wanted to scream. or cry. or faint. or kill someone.   i felt dodgy.&nbsp; i couldn't hold myself up.&nbsp; my head was pounding.&nbsp; my stomach was just killing me (stupid period pains).&nbsp; i felt like i was suffocating.&nbsp; i was far too hot.&nbsp; and i started to feel the beginning of...i don't know...a panic attack, maybe?&nbsp; i wouldn't know.&nbsp; i've only ever had one incident that i'd describe as "a panic attack".&nbsp; and that was about seven years ago.&nbsp; but, it was  something.&nbsp;  and i just decided to get the hell out of there.&nbsp;   so, i&nbsp;clocked out&nbsp;at 3.&nbsp; and the ten minute walk from the staff entrance/exit to the bus stop up the road was the very thing i needed.&nbsp; it was quiet.&nbsp; there were very few people around.&nbsp; there was a nice cool breeze.&nbsp; the walking eased my stomach cramps almost immediately.&nbsp;   and just  that feeling . that feeling of being&nbsp;set free...of being allowed to go away from a place i really didn't wanna be today...well,&nbsp;trust me, it was a good feeling.   tomorrow's problems can be dealt with tomorrow...i'm not even thinking about tomorrow's battles .&nbsp;     &nbsp;  and do you see why i *really* shouldn't work with the&nbsp;great british general public...?    post script:&nbsp; after re-reading what i've just written, i feel the need to apologise for (but not delete) my use of the word "motherfuckers".&nbsp; i don't like to swear/curse on my blog.&nbsp; it's a sign of a very limited vocabulary, i know, which is why i usually refrain from using expletives.&nbsp; but, in this case, it was necessary.&nbsp; still...i do apologise for any offence i may have caused to my more delicate readers.&nbsp; do forgive me, darlings...&nbsp;:-)

(just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;i got theskyisfallingin from a Radiohead song; fugitivemotel from an Elbow song; and tinylittlefractures from a Snow Patrol song.&nbsp; i'm completely incapable of having an original thought, ok?)   anyway, the new blog, Tiny Little Fractures, is just whatever i want it to be.&nbsp; i've got no specific plans for it as yet.&nbsp; it'll just be a snapshot of what i'm thinking at the time.&nbsp; or what i'm feeling.&nbsp; or a song that means something at that particular moment. or maybe even just random words.&nbsp;   but it'll mostly be random anyway.&nbsp; with no explanation.&nbsp; and&nbsp;(probably) infrequently updated.   although, like i said, i haven't worked out the details of it yet, so you never know...

      currently listening to:  reo speedwagon -  keep on loving you     "...and i meant every word i said, when i said that i loved you, i meant that i love you forever..."    you may or may not have noticed that i've changed the font of my blog.  i hope you have noticed the difference.&nbsp; but if you're anything like me, you might not have.   i'm one of the least observant people ever.   i could meet you on the street, and stand and chat to you for an hour, and if someone asked me later what you were wearing i probably wouldn't be able to tell them.&nbsp; (unless, of course, you were wearing something unusual - like an itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny yellow polka-dot&nbsp;bikini in the middle of winter; or a shocking-pink wedding dress with muddy green wellington boots and a pirate's hat; or a clown outfit complete with scary wig, comedy nose, and extra big shoes; or your birthday suit (ooh la la, baby...); or a Spiderman costume - i'd be just plain dumb if i didn't notice any of  those ...)&nbsp; but if you were just dressed "normally" (whatever the hell  that  means)&nbsp;i probably wouldn't really notice what you were wearing - not enough to give details about it later on, anyway.   and i'd be utterly crap if i was ever the victim or witness of a crime and had to give a description of the offender.&nbsp; 'cause unless he looked  exactly  like johnny depp, or elvis, or jim carrey, or whoever, i'd be stumped to remember what he looked like from such a (hopefully) brief encounter.&nbsp; but i'd be ok at identifying that bastard from photos or a line-up.&nbsp; i'd remember him then, goddammit.&nbsp; i'd just find it difficult to describe him from memory alone.   and if someone asks me what someone else looks like (someone that they've never seen, obviously, else why the hell would they be asking me?) i usually say something weak, such as "well, he's tall.&nbsp; and he's got dark hair.&nbsp; and arms, yeah, he has arms.&nbsp; and legs, too.&nbsp; two of 'em, in fact.&nbsp; two legs.&nbsp; and...." by which point the person who i'm trying to describe the second person to&nbsp;is usually saying something like "oh, for christ's sake.&nbsp; nevermind.&nbsp; it was a simple bloody question. why do you have to be so damn awkward, Angela?"   anyway.&nbsp; i seem to have lost my point.&nbsp; it's entirely possible that i didn't even  have  one to begin with.&nbsp;  (surprise, surprise...)   just leave a comment anyway, ok?&nbsp; i haven't had one for a few days, and i'm feeling lonely here ;-)

      currently listening to:  coldplay -  shiver     "...and on and on, from the moment i wake 'til the moment i sleep, i'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me..."    well. it's nearly midnight on a sunday. which means that tomorrow must be monday. (monday usually does follow sunday, don't you know?)  and how i hate mondays.  i still get the monday-morning blues even though it's been nine years since i left high school - the place where the monday-morning blues began for me.  and it's not like i have the whole weekend off to dread going back to work on monday. 'cause unlike some of you lucky bastards, i have to work weekends. although i was off today, but that's not the point....  (....damn, what is my point....?)  ....ok. there is no point.  except i don't like mondays ( "tell me why. i don't like mondays. tell me why. i don't like mondays." )  and now i have only six minutes of sunday left to enjoy. so, i'm gonna smoke a cigarette. and then go to bed....  'cause Scootah's waiting for me already. and i want to get to sleep before he starts snoring and mumbling in his sleep about  The Lion King  being totally unrealistic and  Born Free  being such a big pile of crap. he's one crazy lion cub, i tell ya. missing africa when he hasn't even been there?!&nbsp; how can you miss something you've never known?  that's what i wanna know ...  anyway, 'night 'night people. sleep tight. even though you don't have a Scootah to keep you company....*sigh*

'cause you don't even know why they are there.&nbsp;  and smile again.  and laugh.  it's the best medicine.  that, and chocolate.  cures all minor problems.  laughter and chocolate.  (alcohol for the major problems.)  ok.  now stop.  stop writing, for christ's sake.  stop.  you are happy.  so stop trying to find things to worry about.  because there is nothing to worry about.  everything will be ok.  or, in the words of Coldplay: Everything's Not Lost.  so just stop writing.  right now.  stop writing.  stop.  and go.

      currently listening to:  travis -  indefinitely     "...time exists, but just on your wrist, so don't panic..."    it's been a weird kinda day. do you ever feel like, even though your job is crap, you still wanna put&nbsp;some effort into it, and see what you can achieve?&nbsp; well, that was the kind of day i had today. it began with a lot of stifling of bored yawns and (failed) attempts to look interested in what my workmate was rambling on and on and on about. in&nbsp;an almost desperate bid for freedom, peace, and harmony (or, just a moment's silence...) i even went out to the horrible, killer-moth infested shed that is our storeroom. and i was in there for about thirty minutes - just getting some stock; tidying it up a little bit; and cold-sweating with the absolute fear that, at any given moment, one of those sneaky&nbsp;bastards could come flying out of a box at me...determined to&nbsp;kill me by it's mere presence.&nbsp;anyway, it didn't happen (this time...) although there were a fair few moth corpses lying around in there.&nbsp;with a bit of luck they've got&nbsp;themselves an evil&nbsp;insect-enemy in there - one&nbsp;that is slowly&nbsp;but surely reaching&nbsp;it's goal to drive the buggers to extinction.&nbsp; here's hoping that's the case, anyway.  so, in a very small way, i felt that i had achieved something. sure, it was only going out to the shed for stock. but if you understood how utterly petrified i am of those bat-sized moths, you'd know&nbsp;what i put myself through in there. and you'd be proud of me. it's&nbsp;worthy of a pat on the back,  at least . (although i secretly think i deserve a small medal; a certificate for outstanding bravery and dedication to my job; and a Â£50 HMV gift voucher. but oh well...)  other than that, the day was long and tiring. and little of any significance happened.&nbsp;oh, except the chips in the staff canteen were particularly tasty today. and i got a free bottle of diet pepsi. and a free packet of cadbury's buttons. (healthy, ain't i?) and...well, actually, that's pretty much it...*yawn* ;-)&nbsp;

(i think i'd have a few problems with all that being  a parent  involves now, and i'm 25!). and then, to be 14 and pregnant, and  then  have to deal with a miscarriage...well, just how do you cope with that when you're nothing&nbsp;more than&nbsp;a kid yourself. but jesus christ, give the&nbsp;girl a break. hasn't she already been through enough without being given her dead baby in a jar to take home? it's just too horrible to even think about any longer...   ...so, i'm gonna move on to the lighter stuff:&nbsp;those crazy Americans have now devised a way for US soldiers to hydrate their dried food with dirty water or even....wait for it...  urlLink urine . and i'm left&nbsp;wondering what would be more gross - eating food that has been hydrated by one's own piss, or by someone else's...? hmm. can't quite decide which would be more stomach-churningly weird...   ...Peter Frampton is complaining about  urlLink bikinis . or, specifically, having his face printed on bikinis. if that was my biggest concern in life, i'd consider myself extremely lucky, Peter...   ...filming has begun on the new series of  urlLink Dr Who . i'm really dubious about Billie Piper being in it. i still see her as a really annoying kid who released a couple of really bad songs and then married Chris Evans and spent a hell of a lot of time drinking. but maybe she'll prove me wrong...i hope so anyway...   ...and finally...  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  amused me. especially the "who listens?" part :-)

      currently listening to:  black sabbath -  paranoid     "...people think i'm insane, because i am&nbsp;frowning all the time..."     &nbsp;  people were looking at Angela&nbsp;like&nbsp;she was a freak this morning (or maybe&nbsp; she  was just being paranoid...but&nbsp;she must have looked&nbsp;a bit odd,&nbsp;anyway...) 'cause the sun was cracking the skies. and&nbsp;there was Angela -&nbsp;carrying&nbsp;her sexy, green, standard issue&nbsp;fleece jacket to work. (not  wearing  it, but carrying it.)  &nbsp;  but who was laughing at approximately 3 p.m. when the sun disappeared? and when it got chilly? and when it started raining? who was laughing then? yep,&nbsp;Angela was.  &nbsp;  all those fools (staff  and  visitors) who'd left home in their summer finery were shivering and getting soaked. but not Angela...no, not Angela.&nbsp;she was all snug and warm&nbsp;in&nbsp;her fleece, and (when it was time for Angela to leave) all dry under&nbsp;her umbrella. when are people gonna learn that they have to be prepared for all possible weather scenarios in this country? tut.  &nbsp;  anyway, enough of this "oh, how brilliant Angela is!" nonsense...  &nbsp;  Angela has&nbsp;started reading a book. yes,&nbsp; a book .  Angela is reading a book . she did tell you that she had bought one a couple of weeks back. but she didn't get very far with it. 'cause it wasn't as good as she thought it'd be. and she tired of it very quickly. so this morning, on the bus going&nbsp;to work, she began reading another book. a book she's had for absolutely ages and never got around to reading yet. (or,  forgot that she even had , if she's telling the truth). and you know what? she was enjoying reading this book so much that she nearly missed her stop. she looked up from her book just in time to realise where she was, and where she was meant to be getting off the bus. that was lucky, wasn't it? the book that Angela is reading is called  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy .&nbsp;  and it was written by a very funny man called Douglas Adams. and Angela is enjoying it very much so far :-)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  [Angela&nbsp;is sorry, but she doesn't know&nbsp;why she is talking about herself&nbsp;in such a detached manner. but it makes a change from writing "i...i...i...i..." all the time, she guesses...]

Youâll be surprised how many times you have to cross the same river. &nbsp; Laugh a lot. A good sense of humour cures almost all of lifeâs ills. &nbsp; Never cut what can be untied. &nbsp; Be willing to lose a battle in order to win the war. &nbsp; Never eat the last biscuit. &nbsp; Smile a lot. It costs nothing and is beyond price. &nbsp; Remember that winners do what losers donât want to do. &nbsp; Learn to listen, opportunity sometimes knocks very softly. &nbsp; so, there ya go...inspiration on a plate (or, on a blog, if ya wanna be picky about it. and i bet you do, you pesky little blog-readers...) &nbsp; now go forth, children! and practice what i preach...just don't come crying to me when it all goes wrong. i'm washing my hands of the whole thing.

(until i realised just how pathetic&nbsp;that was!)  &nbsp;  and that extra 75 minutes (excluding time after closing to cash-up and have a quick tidy around the shop) has made me feel so tired.  and we've got another six weeks of this...oh, joy...roll on september when the little blighters go back to school...    but, anyway...  &nbsp;  look what's finally up on Angela's bedroom wall, after about three months of&nbsp;it lying around waiting for the addition of Blu-Tack and a good place to stick itself:  &nbsp;   urlLink     &nbsp;  &nbsp;...it's in pride of place, above Angela's bed...snug up against one-of-two posters of Aragorn i have in my room.&nbsp; now, don't you boys be fighting over me...you can share me... &nbsp;  oh,&nbsp;a girl can dream, can't she ? ;-)

        currently listening to: supergrass  -  moving    "...and when it's over, i'll see you again..."   &nbsp; well, i sort of&nbsp;promised not to blog again for a few days, following yesterday's monotonous bloggy antics... &nbsp; yet, here i am. &nbsp; i go through these phases, you see. sometimes i wanna write a lot, and keep a record of whatever the frick i'm doing or thinking. other times, i can't be bothered or just have nothing to say. (or nothing that i want you to hear / read anyway...) &nbsp; so, it's nearly midnight. i was feeling extremely tired up until about twenty minutes ago when i got a sudden and inexplicable burst of energy. for a moment, i thought i actually wanted to  do  something...go to a dirty, sweaty rock club...or have a game of soccer...or bake&nbsp;a cake...or  something . then, as quick as the moment came, it was gone again. and the tiredness returned to me like a tidalwave. &nbsp; i've got to get around to either going to see a doctor; or buying (and taking) some iron supplements or something. 'cause i'm just not sure it's normal for me to be feeling so tired and drained so often. sure, i love my sleep. and i love being lazy. but i like laziness-out-of-personal-choice and not this jeez-i-might-wanna-be-active-but-i-just-don't-have-the-energy thing that i'm having. and i'm pretty sure it's just a lack of iron in my body that's doing this to me. or it could be another side-effect of my desperate need for a break. or, even better, a&nbsp;holiday...somewhere warm; somewhere new and different; somewhere  outside  of Great Bloody Britain...  maybe a long, lazy lie-in tomorrow will do me some good in the meantime...while i'm waiting for that holiday to materialise...it won't hurt to try, anyway, will it?&nbsp; :-)

How true is this, aah the good old days!  Hello children of the 80's. Read this, it will take you back but be careful 'cause it will also make you realise that you are now actually quite old.......   1..  Um Bongo, Um Bongo, They drink it in the Congo.   2.. You played with "My Little Ponies."  3..  Friendship bracelets were ties that couldn't be broken.   4..  You ever read Nancy Drew.   5.. The Hardy Boys, The Babysitters Club, Forever or Sweet Valley High.  6.. You wanted to be on "Jim'll Fix It".  7.. You wore one of those slap-on wristbands at some point...or heaven forbid one of those T-shirts that changed colour with heat (Global Hypercolour).  8..  You were upset when She-ra, Princess of Power and He-Man got cancelled.   9..  You can remember watching Saved by the Bell.   10.. You even wore fluorescent-neon clothing... (if you can call it clothing!).  11.. You could break dance (ok, you wished you could).  12..  You remember when Amiga was a state of the art video game system.   13..  You remember M.C. Hammer.   14..  You can still sing the rap to "Fresh Prince of Bel Air".   15..  You can remember when it was Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince and NOT just plain Will Smith!   16..  You own ANY cassettes.   17..  You have ever pondered on why Smurfette was the ONLY female smurf.   18..  My Little Pony, Gummy Bears and Transformers are familiar to you.   19..  You ever had a Swatch Watch.   20..  You believed that "By the power of Greyskull, you HAD the power!"   21.. With your pink (or blue) portable tape player, you sang to kylie and Jason!  22..  Partying "like it's 1999" seemed SO far away.   23.. You were led to believe that in the year 2000 we'd all be living in space.  24..  You recorded songs off the radio with your boom box.   25..  Your arm was full of rubber bracelets.   26.. You wore those wide, colourful shoelaces.  27..  You never questioned why the A-Team were always imprisoned in places that had sufficient tools to build an armoured tank.   28..  You ever did the top toggle of your coat up around your neck without having your arms in the sleeves, and you knew you looked like a superhero.   29.. You remember watching a house inhabited by a jester, A pantomime horse and a woman who sneezed, and thinking that this was perfectly normal.  30.. You've never had more than 10 sweets in a 10p mix-up.  31..  You could have got away with it if it wasn't for those meddling kids.   32..  You remember Fingermouse and Dangermouse (not forgetting his trusty sidekick Penfold!).   33..  You remembered Monster Munch when they were 10p.   34..  When 'Computer' Tennis, Pac-Man and Donkey-Kong ruled.   35..  You remember hearing the tune then running out to buy an ice cream cone on a warm summer night - 99's, screwballs or a cider Lolly.   36..  You got up extra early, especially to watch Saturday Morning cartoons.   37..  You remember Ant and Dec as PJ and Duncan.   38..  Water balloons were the ultimate weapon.   39..  It wasn't odd to have two or three "best" friends.   40..  You remember when Snickers were Marathons and Starburst were Opal Fruits.   41.. You remember when 25p was decent pocket money and you'd reach into a muddy gutter for 10p.  42..  Important decisions were made by going "eeny-meeny-miney-mo."   43.. Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better and taking drugs meant orange-flavoured chewable aspirin.  44..You called Going Live on 081 811 8181.  45..And you had your own Gordon the Gopher.

      currently listening to:  supergrass -  brecon beacons    "...there were tiny tears on the cheeks of witches..."   i seem to be writing a lot of crap here today.  and i'll probably be back later with some more...if you're unlucky ;-)  i only wish i had something more interesting for ya!!

      currently listening to:  supergrass -  za    "...'cause time waits for no-one, so why don't we get it on?..."   i've just had a moment of total confusion. i woke up to see 8:03 in big digital numbers on my bedside clock; curtains closed; light peeking into my room through the gap where i hadn't closed them together properly...  and i panicked. for a moment. pure panic. i thought it was tomorrow morning. i thought i was going to be late, and miss the bus, and have to get a taxi in to work...  and then i realised it was still thursday. [it is, isn't it? i didn't sleep straight through to 8.03 p.m. friday?] i didn't even really realise that i'd gone to sleep, actually. last thing i remember it was roughly 6:30 and i was just lying down on my bed to rest from my busy day (hahaha!) for a minute.  it must have been in a deep-ish sleep too. 'cause i slept through a text message on my phone and an instant message from  urlLink Caroline  (sorry, mate! wasn't ignoring ya...i was away with the fairies!)  i'm hungry again....

      currently listening to:  guns n' roses -  sweet child o' mine    "...and if i stared too long, i'd probably break down and cry..."   well, the day (so far) has turned out to be pretty dull. mostly due to a sudden heavy downpour of rain which soaked me and my jeans, and forced me to go home and change.   so, i've been hanging around in my bedroom for the last couple of hours. listening to the two CD's i bought today. and reading this week's copy of  urlLink NME  while eating Starburst Sour Chews (they're not very nice; they make my face go all screwed up, like i'm sucking on a bitter lemon; but i've still managed to eat a fair few of 'em so far.)  and i'm once again struck by the fact that i've just managed to completely waste a day off work. but since i'm giving serious thought to phoning in sick tomorrow (so i can have three days off in a row) i'm not gonna worry about it all too much. laziness, thy name is Angela...  (p.s. the apple flavour Sour Chew is particularly sour...i don't know if my face is  ever  gonna unscrew itself....)

      currently listening to:  iron maiden -  wasted years    "...i'm travelling on, far and wide, but now it seems, i'm just a stranger to myself..."   well, it's now noon. i've showered and got dressed. i've smoked more than one cigarette. i've moved on from My Dying Bride to Iron Maiden (again). i've put on make-up and jewellery (watch; necklace; and the tacky mood ring i inadvertently stole from work and "forgot" to return...). i've shown my dad how to open the bloody DVD player (again). i've watched my mum crying, about something, in the kitchen. i've sent a couple of text messages; read a few blogs; and i've idly gazed in amazement at the state of my bedroom. but i'm not gonna clean or tidy it today...i just can't be bothered. i'm hungry but i don't know what i feel like eating. my eyes are no longer puffy - i'm looking better already. and i'm wearing stripy socks today :-) i'm awake!   so, what next...? i'm sitting here, blogging again. but what comes after that? well, it's pay day, so  that  opens up a whole new set of possibilities...hmmm...(can you hear those little cogs turning in my head...?) ;-)

      currently listening to:  my dying bride -  grace unhearing    "...beat it out, out of me, cut me up and watch me bleed..."   i'm up way too early considering that (a.) it's my day off and i've got nothing specific planned to be up  for , and (b.) i didn't go to sleep until about two-thirty this morning.  but, i'm awake. and online. and blogging. and listening to My Dying Bride, for some bizarre reason 'cause it's really  not  made-for-first-thing-in-the-morning music. and i'm drinking cold lemonade; being driven crazy by the persistently-slipping-off-my-right-shoulder strap on the little vest top i wore to bed last night. my eyes feel (and look) puffy, as they always do when i first wake up. this is me looking at my very worst - first thing in the morning. it looks all damp and miserable outside of my bedroom window, and i'm tempted to crawl back into the warmth and safety of my bed...  but i'm not gonna do that. i'm gonna go and smoke a cigarette; have a shower and wash my hair; get dressed (eventually); and then see where this day takes me...it's a mini adventure... really .

      currently listening to:  kings of convenience -  i'd rather dance with you    "...the music's too loud, and the noise from the crowd increases the chance of misinterpretation, so let your hips do the talking..."   firstly, i just wanna say that  urlLink Kings of Convenience  have (a) a cool name and (b) two cool album titles now, with  Quiet Is The New Loud  and  Riot On An Empty Street . they are also tip-top perfect for chillin' out to on a sunday afternoon (and yes, i'm aware that it's tuesday evening, but it can be a sunday afternoon if i goddamn want it to be...)  anyway, just wanted to tell ya that.  so, what's new? well, not much really. i'm still working my little fingers to the bone at the zoo. and not being paid near enough for it, either. but that's the way life is, so deal with it, Angela. (just talking to myself there...don't worry about it...)  but, all in all, life is going pretty well for me right now. i'm smiling more and worrying less. so that's gotta be a good sign? i think it is, anyway...   today, a friend told me that i "think too much" and while this isn't exactly a revelation to me, it did make me think [which was probably the opposite of what was intended, but whatever...!] that i totally  do  think too much. but that is what i was given a brain for, surely? so i can't see me changing that anytime in the near future. besides, there are worse habits to have than that of "thinking too much."   and one of these days, i may even come up with something... you just never know ...

      currently listening to:  rush -  the trees    "...the trouble with the maples, and they're quite convinced they're right, they say the oaks are just too lofty, and they grab up all the light..."   i've just realized today's date. it's the first anniversary of my graduation from university... one whole year as a graduate .    and i'm left wondering where the last 366 days have disappeared to. this time last year i was filled with hope. i certainly didn't think that, one year on, i'd still be living here. i thought i'd be far away. i was meant to be, but things change.  and usually for the better...  i'd never have believed i'd still be living with my parents. but i'm accepting the fact that, for now at least,  it is my only option ... i'm on my second crappy job since graduating. but the second is infinitely more fun than the first (even if it does pay less) and i've met so many great people there, who i'd never have known otherwise.  so everything has it's value...  i'm still in debt up to my eyeballs.  but i'm learning not to worry so much about that...  i still haven't passed my driving test.  but i'll get it next time, godammit, even if it kills me...  i still don't know what i'm going to do with the degree i gained one year ago today. but i still keep that hope...that one day,  i'll know . i'll wake up one day and  i'll know ...or that's the plan, anyway.  and in the meantime, while i'm waiting for a flash of divine inspiration, there's some living to be done...there's some wasted time to be made up for...and there's some fun to be had... :-)  oh, and i forgot to mention that the amazing  urlLink Gern C. Branston  has returned to the world of blogging after a very long absence. i can't believe they finally let him out of that lunatic asylum, but i'm so glad that they did...

(just kidding! i don't do that!)  dreaming.  'cause we all know that actions speak so much louder than words...

      currently listening to:  badly drawn boy -  takes the glory    "...summer takes all the glory, blue skies are turning to grey..."   i really didn't wanna go into work today...like,  really . i lay in bed until my mum came banging at my bedroom door (one of the many annoyances of living with the folks is the fact that they'll moan at me if i don't go into work) reminding me that i should be getting ready. or be out of bed, at least. so, i got up and stumbled around like a zombie and tried to decide whether to phone in sick or not. i thought about it in the shower. i thought about it while i got dressed. i thought about it while i smoked that all important first cigarette of the day. and before i knew it, i was thinking about it while i was phoning for a taxi to take me to frickin' work. so, i went in. but then, as soon as i got there, i wished with all my heart and soul and every fibre of my body that i had phoned in with a mystery one-day-only illness. but it was too late by then. and the day was about as dull as dull can ever be. and all i could think about is those fireworks i'm missing out on today. and how i wished that i was there instead of here...   happy fourth of july, America .

(and i actually haven't even had any chocolate today, so i've just ruined my own comparison, but so what? i'm sure you get the idea...)  and:  1.) never underestimate the intense heat of melted cheese.  2.) try not to look so utterly horrified if you meet someone who doesn't know who Marlon Brando is/was. learn to accept that there are some people in this world who haven't seen  The Godfather . (but also note that those same people aren't worth knowing, anyway. for that very reason alone.)   3.) don't throw water-filled squeeze balls at customers (or, learn to aim better at your workmate target.)  4.) don't wear new shoes when you have to walk great distances and keep the damn things on all day. even when the skin has been completely rubbed off your heels. ouch...

[played through my computer :-( ]  oh my god. i don't believe this. my cd player seems to be broken :-( my beloved cd player, which i love and adore and use far too often, is dead (or dying.) and i was only thinking a couple of weeks ago how long this cd player has lasted. how faithful it's been. how wonderful it is. how it's never given me any trouble. and how i love it so. and now it's just spinning and spinning and spinning when i press that little button with the triangle on...that magic button that  should  make the beautiful music flow out of the speakers...filling my room, and my heart, with happiness. oh, this is bad. i can't live without my music. and i can't be bothered to have to play stuff through my computer all the time... that's just not the same . *ok...breathe, Angela, breathe...stay calm...deep breaths...it might be fixable...don't lose hope just yet...maybe the lens just needs cleaning... please remain calm ...*

(i did see two or three really cool lizard designs, but i figure that one lizard tattoo is enough for me. but they  were  really cool, so who knows...)  i want to get my nose re-pierced too 'cause i've left my nose stud out for far too long now, and the hole is half closed up. my one attempt to reopen it myself ended in just a few tears and plenty of bloodshed, so i'm not trying  that  again...   (oh, and, in case you're interested, the man across the street is now attacking that garage door with an electric circular saw. he means business now...)

      listening to:  billy idol -  white wedding    "...it's a nice day to start again..."   just because, after the total bitch of a day i've had, this made me laugh...  From a little book called "Disorder in the Court." They're things people actually said in court, word for word.  Q: What was the first thing your husband said to you when he woke that morning? A: He said, "Where am I, Cathy?" Q: And why did that upset you? A: My name is Susan.  Q: What is your date of birth? A: July fifteenth. Q: What year? A: Every year.  Q: What gear were you in at the moment of the impact? A: Gucci sweats and Reeboks.  Q: This myasthenia gravis -- does it affect your memory at all? A: Yes. Q: And in what ways does it affect your memory? A: I forget. Q: You forget. Can you give us an example of something that you've forgotten?  Q: How old is your son -- the one living with you. A: Thirty-eight or thirty-five, I can't remember which. Q: How long has he lived with you? A: Forty-five years.  Q: And where was the location of the accident? A: Approximately milepost 199. Q: And where is milepost 199? A: Probably between milepost 198 and 200.  Q: Sir, what is your IQ? A: Well, I can see pretty well, I think.  Q: Did you blow your horn or anything? A: After the accident? Q: Before the accident. A: Sure, I played for ten years. I even went to school for it.  Q: Do you know if your daughter has ever been involved in the voodoo or a cult? A: We both do. Q: Voodoo? A: We do. Q: You do? A: Yes, voodoo.  Q: Trooper, when you stopped the defendant, were your red and blue lights flashing? A: Yes. Q: Did the defendant say anything when she got out of her car? A: Yes, sir. Q: What did she say? A: What disco am I at?  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Recently reported in the Massachusetts Bar Association Lawyers Journal the following are questions actually asked of witnesses by attorneys during trials and, in certain cases, the responses given by insightful witnesses:  Q: Now doctor, isn't it true that when a person dies in his sleep, he doesn't know about it until the next morning?  Q: The youngest son, the twenty-year old, how old is he?  Q: Were you present when your picture was taken?  Q: Was it you or your younger brother who was killed in the war?  Q: Did he kill you?  Q: How far apart were the vehicles at the time of the collision?  Q: You were there until the time you left, is that true?  Q: How many times have you committed suicide?  Q: So the date of conception (of the baby) was August 8th? A: Yes. Q: And what were you doing at that time?  Q: All your responses must be oral, OK? What school did you go to? A: Oral.  Q: Do you recall the time that you examined the body? A: The autopsy started around 8:30 p.m. Q: And Mr. Dennington was dead at the time? A: No, he was sitting on the table wondering why I was doing an autopsy.  Q: Are you qualified to give a urine sample?  Q: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse? A: No. Q: Did you check for blood pressure? A: No. Q: Did you check for breathing? A: No. Q: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy? A: No. Q: How can you be so sure, Doctor? A: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar. Q: But could the patient have still been alive nevertheless? A: It is possible that he could have been alive and practising law somewhere.  Q: She had three children, right? A: Yes. Q: How many were boys? A: None. Q: Were there any girls?   Q: You say the stairs went down to the basement? A: Yes. Q: And these stairs, did they go up also?  Q: Mr. Slatery, you went on a rather elaborate honeymoon, didn't you? A: I went to Europe, Sir. Q: And you took your new wife?  Q: How was your first marriage terminated? A: By death. Q: And by whose death was it terminated?  Q: Can you describe the individual? A: He was about medium height and had a beard. Q: Was this a male, or a female?  Q: Is your appearance here this morning pursuant to a deposition notice which I sent to your attorney? A: No, this is how I dress when I go to work.  Q: Doctor, how many autopsies have you performed on dead people? A: All my autopsies are performed on dead people.  Q: You were not shot in the fracas? A: No, I was shot midway between the fracas and the navel.

(which i bought today, along with  The Alltime Greatest Rock Classics of the 70's, 80's & 90's -  which is a bold claim, and one i'm not sure i entirely agree with it, but whatever.)  ...and it seems that Anthony Kiedis either (a.) thought i was there (i woulda been too, if i hadn't been so damn lazy about everything) or (b.) just wished that i was there (and why the hell should that surprise anyone? huh? people love me, you know....) because right before they start playing  Brandy  he says:  "this song....if you were in the early 70's....you mighta been really cool and liked Zeppelin or Black Sabbath or Queen....you mighta been a rocker....but if you were just slightly obscure....kinda mellow....and you wore gold chains....you mighta liked this song....i promise you....i assure you...you will love it....there's at least one little redheaded girl in the audience that will absolutely adore this tune..."  so, d'ya reckon he was thinking about me? i can only wish... ;-)

      listening to:  coldplay -  shiver    "...sing it loud and clear, i'll always be waiting for you..."     head hurts. hate driving (today.) thunder. and now rain. need to go out and buy birthday card and present for my dad. oh, and some cigarettes. but i just wanna sit here and listen to Coldplay.  and read other people's blogs. and i'd eat chocolate, if i had any. my bed isn't made.  and that makes me wanna get back into it.  and sleep. i'm the laziest person in the world. chew gum and listen to Coldplay. that's all i wanna do today. but i'd better go out.  get some money; spend some money. it's thursday, after all.

      listening to:  elbow -  powder blue    "...your eyes are just like black spiders, your hair and dress in ribbons, babycakes, in despair or incoherent, nothing in between..."   i just love  urlLink this . it's beautiful and simple and sad and...well, just see for yourself.  (warning: if you don't like Radiohead's  Creep  [for some bizarre and stupid reason] then you probably shouldn't watch it, but you'll be missing out.)

      listening to:  r.e.m. -  orange crush    "...follow me, don't follow me, i've got my spine, i've got my orange crush..."     see where i sit and write this crap...   urlLink     see the graduation bear... see the stolen pen... see the one dollar bill... see the fake peacock-feather mardi gras mask... see the collection of little animals... see the green elvis shot-glass... see the rainbows on my desktop... see the guardian (with sword) who watches over me... see the general junk that lives on my desk...

      listening to:  marillion -  punch and judy    "...whatever happened to morning smiles? whatever happened to wicked wiles, permissive styles? whatever happened to twinkling eyes?..."   well, i'm writing this purely because it's the first of august, and this will be my 300th post on  clutching at straws  (formerly known as  the sky is falling in ;  where i end and you begin ; and :  gold for the price of silver  : )  i really don't have anything remotely exciting to say.  or anything unexciting either, for that matter.  it's been a long, hot, and tiring day at work - complete with the obligatory attack by an alien-looking insect; swarms of screaming children; and their f**king annoying parents (other people's parents, not my own); arguments about pushchairs and Â£50 notes; and other such s**t.  anyway.  it's over now.  nearly time for me to go to bed; sleep; wake up; get showered and dressed; and  do it all over again ....  *groan*  somebody, get me away from here....please....i'm beggin' ya....throw me a frickin' lifeline....
