						    Time....How many of us seem to think we never have enough of it or how it doesn't pass quickly enough for us....Time has got to be a figment of our imagination...Because it never seems to be like we need it to be LOL....It's been a busy few days. All of a sudden the hope I had that my book would be published has become a reality and now of course time is of the essence....  This leaves me in a very quirky predictament.... Why? Because now the story that is directly from my heart, as well as my life will be public and open to scrutiny...Whoa....What a concept eh? I always did believe 'be careful what you wish for...You just might get it!'   I got it!   In other strands of my life, things are picking up with sweets...Interestingly enough it is an oddity to be in love with someone and not be sexually active at all. Sweets and I have never been sexually active with one another for no other reason then we haven't gone that far yet...Today I was laughed at by someone because we didn't live together or have a sexual relationship...Of course then she went into a tirade about the very husband she lives with and has sex with....hmmm...She's miserable doing the very thing sweets and I haven't. Not sure why she laughed....Seems to me the fact that we are happy and she and her hubby are not speaks volumes.....  People...Go figure...Their as enigmatic as time....

						    I had to take a breather from working...once again I found myself getting lost in the world of my book and within the feelings of the characters...ugh, I hate that! Sometimes while writing I become so engrossed in what the characters are feeling, my own feelings seem to die off. That's so hard to shake off and probably one of the main reason's I started this....to have a safe place to regain my sanity after writing for hours on end.   I probably should write some about who I am, however I am going to continue to remember the old adage "anything you say can and will be used against you..." The last thing I need is for someone to equate this blog with my pen name and say wow I know where so and so writes her thoughts at...LOL    So I little about me; where to begin? I am a 35 year old female. I have no family left alive so essentially I am all alone in this world now. Most find that disheartening, I have found it almost easier to be alone then to deal with the family ties. I am a tiny person standing just under 5 foot tall and weighing less then 95lbs. I am definately a secure person, and while some might assume I am cocky or arrogant I am actually just very self assured and comfortable with my looks and who I am.  I honestly hate describing myself so other then the above description I think I will not bother. Spirit knows I don't need this to sound like some bad personal add....LOL  Obviously my passion is my work, otherwise I wouldn't become so wrapped up in it and need an escape of some sort. Due to my work I often spend time alone, although I wouldn't call myself a 'loner'...I do enjoy the company of others as long as they aren't stupid. Stupid people are my biggest pet peeve. There is nothing wrong with not knowing something, thereby having to acquire the knowledge...but when your just plain stupid.....ack that kills me..... Of course the world would be pretty dull without stupid people...but none the less, I could stand to see a lot less of them!  Well I have wasted enough useless brain cells babbling here for now...I had best get back to work....hopefully soon I can pull myself away from my work enough to work on this blog...Keep your fingers crossed!

						     There is nothing more exciting then moving into and learning more about a new home...during the day today that is precisely what I am doing. Since I have never blogged before learning the various way that I can change, manipulate and operate this thing is providing me with a new diversion for my already too busy mind. I should be working but what the hell right?
