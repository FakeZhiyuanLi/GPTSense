      This blogger thing has been great and very easy to use, but it is time to build a website of my very own =)

       Lounge fun...          Me:&nbsp;Would you like to get a drink?    Somewhat attractive girl: No!    Me: I think you misheard me. I said you&nbsp;really stink.       Good thing I kept the last comment to myself. I always get sniped when&nbsp;I say these SMART comments out loud, by accident of course =)&nbsp;   The other day I saw&nbsp;an attractive&nbsp;girl walking her dog. I pulled up to a stop sign at the same time she stops on the corner&nbsp;wanting to cross the street. I always wait for the pedestrian to signal their intention to cross the street or for me to go, but in this case&nbsp;I failed miserably.&nbsp;&nbsp;We made eye contact and she even gave me an alluring smile and wave, and me being so cool listening to "Usher, Confessions" not even return a smile or wave just drive off.  Did you ever do something and a second later think to yourself&nbsp;"I'm such an IDIOT" ?   Moral of the story, pay better attention to opportunities and quit being such a tool. No matter how great the song is and how tight you look, beautiful girls are better.&nbsp; Now i must find that girl to apologize =(&nbsp;

      Why is it that I always get this LFO song in my head when it is sunny outside.  New Kids on the Block had a Bunch of Hits Chinese Food Makes Me Sick And i think its fly when girls stop by for the summer I Like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch I'd take her if i had one wish But she's been gone since that Summer ...   Summer has been great so far. I have not been spending a lot of time with a friends (the TEAM), but we all know we will always be there for each other no matter what. I have been doing a lot of thinking about what I am going to do in the upcoming months. I have recently become interested in teaching English overseas because of my bestest friend but we'll see =)  I have started my excercise routine to become physically fit for the PARE, I enjoy the pain. Applications are out and now it is just a waiting game.

      This is what I think about everyday, the venom that slowly poisons me.  I never knew, what to do, what to say, to make you to believe in my dreams, my silly dreams.  I need a chance to tell you...
