       Well... I haven't posted in a while because I have been pretty busy in the past few days. Okay, I lied. I just didn't feel like posting. Anyways, as my blogmates know, I am now residing at a boarding school by the name of IMSA. It is quite nice here, and I am glad to say that you are missing out Blas. Yesterday IMSA took us to the Brookfield Zoo. I had fun up the wazoo. Okay, I lied again. It was horrendously boring. Hmmm... what else to say? Ah yes, I just remembered that movies are $4.50 here... as opposed to $7.50/$9.00. By the way... guess what kind of computer I am posting this from Blas?

       What the hell, three posts in one day?? You must be bored Blas. Why yes, I am.  Anyway, I just had the sudden urge to start school already. I guess it isn't THAT bad. Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this post so I'm just gonna go play something now.

       Well, Alex is off at IMSA and school is starting soon (20 days = soon) and..... I don't know what else to say. Well, I guess I can laugh at Bianca for realizing (again) that there's no reason not to eat meat. I suggest you all make fun of her in your comments for extra pissoffness. Besides that, nothing is happening. I've realized I'm going to need to put much time into Warcraft III once I get my G5. This includes doing all that lame stuff people did to get better at Starcraft that I so ignorantly badmouthed. I shudder at the fact that I'm going to be watching replays and actually TRYING to get good but unlike in Starcraft, I'll know I reached my goal of being a decent player when I get to level 25 which is the current level average. Eh, that's all for now.

       Seriously, my posts take up like half of our whole blog. If we're ever going to "crotch-thrust forward into the limelight" as Alex so carefully worded it we need to be more active. I'm not saying a post a day but at least one every 3 or 4 days. Anyway, that's all.

       Okay, just so you know, some of this sounds like bullshite but some of them do work.    "All of this comes right from the inside, and much of it comes directly from employee meetings that I have been too. (Oh yeah, and the topic title is a reference to Conan, in case you didnt get it.)  1. If you ever steal anything from the store, the employees are not allowed to touch you in any way. Employees are not even allowed to come up to you and "Interrogate" you unless they see you take the item with their own eyes, and if they lose sight of you for even a second, they must go about it as if you never took anything.  2. Standard procedure for theft is if you beep upon exiting to "politely" ask you to stop and go though again. If you beep the second time, employees are to ask if you took anything and "forgot to pay". If you say no and they didnt see you steal, you can just walk right out and employees are not even allowed to call the police.  3. The only time employees can call the police is if they actually physically see you take something and walk out with it.  4. If you take something and nobody saw you. You can literally sprint out of the store like a bat out of hell and not even worry about it, even if you beep we cant call the cops.  5. If you ever want to keep a VHS that you rented. Just carefully peel off the title sticker of the one you just rented  stick it on a blank VHS and return it. Make sure its blank though, that way it isnt suspicious and can just be "chalked up" as a defective tape. Few people know this, but as long as you arent the first person to rent the item, we CANNOT, by policy accuse ANYONE of being the customer that put the item in defective condition and just have to "take the loss" of the "defective" item.  6.(Usually works only once) If you ever want to keep a dvd, just rent it and be sure to take note of if the cashier opened up the box and checked for the correct item inside before giving it to you. If they didnt. Just leave the store. Wait about 10-20 minutes and call the store up claiming that the item was not in the box when you got home, or that the wrong item was in the box (Replace the DVD you want to keep with some crap one you dont want anymore. More believable this way.) As long as you call the store soon after you leave, we have to just "Take the loss" and blame it on poor "check in" procedure on the part of the employees.  7. The "12 noon" check in, actually takes place at 1PM. So as long as its in before 1PM on the due date. You wont get charged. Not 12PM.  8. If you are one day late in returning an item, just act as if you rented it again and keep it as for another 5-7 days depending on what type of rental it was because you only get charged for late fees based on the rental cycle of the particular item. IE. every 5-7 days depending.  I got tons more... But its late and I want to see if this even gets a response first."

       Okay, this isn't a trick question so don't go looking for tricks in the way the words were worded. There is a solution. Find it out! Here's the puzzle:  You have a very nice, shiny watch. But this is no ordinary watch. This watch can answer two yes or no questions 100% accurately per day You ask, and either a blue or yellow light will flash. Unfortunatley, you don't know which light means yes and which light means no, and you can never find out because there's a 50-50 chance of the lights switching every night.  You happen to be on a game show. The rules are simple. There are three doors. Behind two are goats. Behind one is a shiny red car. Obviously, you want the car. You can choose any door, after asking the watch two questions.  So tell me, What are two questions you can ask so that you will have a 100% chance of getting the car? Remember, it has to work EVERY TIME.   Who will solve it first?

       Yup, decided to add dreams to here.  Number of dreams I can remember today: 3 Number lucid: 1  Six Flags --------  Ah, this dream was awesome. So we all went to Six Flags and there were already a lot of people there. I remember going with Adrian, Diana, Alex, and that's all I can remember. We were walking and all of sudden I realized I had my headphones on. I looked around and everyone had some too, but around their necks. I tried this but mine didn't fit so I put them in my backpack that Adrian had for some reason. I asked him if I could put them in my bag and he said okay, I then offered to carry it and so I did. Along the way more things appeared out of nowhere, mostly clothing that I had to put into the bag. I remember Diana was sad about something and some lady parent was there with us too (who was there with us just at this time). We all said that a roller coaster would probably cheer her up and so we went to go look for one. After searching for a little we found one and it first it looked intimidating but then I realized it was something I had ridden on before. It then looked crappy so we went to look for another one. Along the way we bumped into Henry, Kevin Rabichow, and some other guys. Henry followed us while the rest went along on their own way. Not soon after Henry had joined us we saw James walking along alone. I said something about everyone being here today and James joined us. We never found another roller coaster and it seemed we kept going in circles. The edge of Six Flags was by some really dirty looking factory place but we never left the park. Soon we ended up somewhere and I suddenly was able to fly. I flew around with Diana and the parent from earlier didn't approve. I could tell this by seeing from her perspective me flying with Diana while also dropping something I thought would be a decoy.... for some reason. After that I regained sight through my own eyes and we flew into the attic of this house. There was this werewolf-man puppet thing there who was shaking around. We asked about why he was a puppet and he showed us this curse thing on the wall that he said countered his curse and left his as a puppet. I think after that I flew away by myself and I was finally able to go really high up and anywhere I wanted. Somehow, I remembered having this part of the dream before. Some guy was talking to me in my mind and while I flying around I gained force sight and saw where I had to land. It was in this field with a forest on the right of it and a factory walling its left with a big tree in front of the field. I think Matthew was there and he told me what I had to do. I climbed the tree and broke parts of it off but could not figure out what I had to do as Matthew had not been clear. It was at this point that I realized I was playing a videogame and I kept remembering how everybody I knew knew how to solve this part of the game (it was kind of like Myst) but I could never do it. Frustrated I just flew away. I think that was the end of that dream.  Skinner Before the Evil ------------------- Next I was at Skinner. I think it started with me watching some thing Ms. Clark was presenting but I'm not sure. I don't remember this dream as vividly as the previous dream. I think kids were also outside. I remember walking around the auditorium and then leaving. A lot of stuff happened and I remember Herman's Dad walking towards me in the aprking lot with Leen. And I remember he had an older brother named Victor who looked just like his dad. After seeing Leen and Herman's dad I walked back into school via the place where the special ed. and those other kids boarded their little buses. Some other stuff happened and I was outside of a door (still in school) marked Orchestra (or something like that) with Herman. We were not allowed in if we had not taken Orchestra class and I said that I had taken it for 3 days which he said would be enough.   So we went in and my dad was there watching something. It turned out there was some band thing goin' on and kids I knew from school were playing in a band expertly. Meemee was there and she was playing the drums. We acknowledged each others presence for some reason. After that I think there was another auditorium meeting (something was on but I can't remember what) and somebody discovered that there was this secret switch that revolved the walls to feature bookcases. Also, I think the chairs switched or something, something useless like that.   Skinner During the Evil ------------------- (I separated this part of the dream because the mood is just too different to call it the same dream)  I went into one of the bookcases and flipped the switch to go to the other side. There was a small room with another bookcase and switch. I turned it around and on the other side was this library but it was really dark and scary. I could hear other people's voices but they sounded friendly. Even still I was scared and turned it back around and went into the safety of that small room. Wondering about the auditorium I turned the other bookcase and went back only to find that everyone was gone and it was dark. I got scared again and went back to that little room. In there now though were a little pocket messanger thing that had Proteus (my AIM client) on it, my backpack with all of my school things, and this bag of stuff my dad bought at some time that I don't remember. It didn't make sense for any of that stuff to be there. Scared, I tried to lock the door leading back to the auditorium (the bookcase was replaced by a door) but it wouldn't lock. I sat down and started playing with the pocket Proteus thing and somebody had messaged me. They said something like "I think it's safe. The swordsman left." I replied trying to use my fingers but found it was hard as the buttons were so little. I looked around and found a stylus and typing became easier. Just then, I got the urge to lock the door again as I was really scared of that swordsman guy. The door still wouldn't lock but this time I pulled it really close to me and tried to lock it again. It did and I felt much more safe in that room. Soon my mom came in and I don't think she knew where I was but was telling me that it was okay now and that I should come out. Of course, whenever something like this would happen in my nightmares, it'd always end up being some scary person on the other side. I didn't say anything and she told some random people that I wasn't here and to lock the doors. I jumped at the thought of being stuck there for a long time and opened the door and tried to run and yell to mom. I was REALLY slow and my voice was only a whisper even when I was yelling (like how it always does in these situations) but instead of her getting away, the amazing happened and she saw me. She told me to get my things and I went back to the room and gathered everything I could hold as I was too afraid she'd leave me to put everything into the backpack. Again, contrary to any dream I've ever had, when I came back she was still there, and outside of the auditorium it was really bright.  Skinner After the Evil ------------------ (I'm counting this dream as the same part of Skinner Before the Evil because the moods are the same again, hence the 3 dreams instead of 2)  I walked outside and everybody was out there. Kids were playing in the field and parents were outside with them. The sky was still gray and ugly though. It was then I realized I was dreaming and I became lucid. The first thing I wanted to do was fix the sky. I moved my hand across the gray part and in place of it came the blue you see on a cloudy day. Next, I wanted to make the blue much more clear (like when it's sunny with no clouds) but I couldn't. Instead, I added yellow to the sky (even though there was no sun). I then tried to add the sun but I couldn't. After a bit of trying I woke up and that's the end of this long post. Dreams are fun.  P.S. Excuse any gramatical/spelling errors as I am too lazy to fix everything in this huge post.

       Today, as I slowly made my erratic way through the heart of downtown, I saw left and right the stores that rich assholes went to, the stores that poor paupers went to, and the stores that the cool middle-class people go to, but I will touch on the topic of rich assholes later. Today I rant about the Disney Store. I'm walking on the sidewalk, bumping into people on purpose like a dickjob, when suddenly I am greeted by bright colors and a childish interior. "Holy shit!", I said to Alex, "We need to go there". Alex promptly agreed and we penetrated the store, through the revolving door. At first I was quite satisfied with the items on display. A tiny Power Ranger tent, barely big enough to hold my package, a twenty dollar Power Ranger backpack, barbie dolls, Mickey Mice, and Blue and Red Ranger costumes. It was perfect, I was going to be the Blue Ranger 'cause the Blue Ranger is the best, and Alex was going to be the Red Ranger because the Red Ranger sucks ass. But then, what happens when we try out the Power Ranger outfits? We find that they are not made for us, but for children who are five or more years younger than us and who have lesser packages. I suddenly realized the message that they were trying to send me. "People with big packages shouldn't have fun." The allure of the Disney Store soon wore off. Disillusioned, I made my way out of the store onto the sidewalk, where millionaires and bums alike can take up space. I'll have you know that I am boycotting the Disney Store now.

       Hey Blas... guess where I am. No, you're wrong. I am at the Apple store. Aren't you jealous? What satisfies me the most is that I don't even want to be here. I'll try to set safari to www.tubgirl.com, just for you, alright? Enjoy, fatboy.

            urlLink Elftor.com , home of the gangbanging money making playa that rocks your grandma, is worth a vist now and then. I almost didn't give it a chance due to its crude visuals, but, after reading the first ten segments I was hooked. It's satirical witty in your face humor is what gives itself luster. The themes of the comics are usually that of real world events and our beefed out society. So, the most recent comic was basically talking about the fact that when people that are not of a race of Afro-Americon are trying to act black, jokingly, suddenly turn off and start acting more to their own sterotype when a real man of the motherland brings his grace. I found this particular really funny because this kind of situation happens to my friends and I all of the time. My friends and I would be walking down the sidewalk messing around and respecting African American culture when all of a sudden my friend gives warning that a blackman is in proximity, our fun is then doused and we quickly act according to the norm.  It then takes awhile for our roots to kick back in.

       I've come to the realization that so far our blog freakin' rocks. What with all the sarcastic remarks and bitch-ass comments, what's not to like? Contrary to what Matthew is saying, I don't feel it necessary yet to make our blog gain more notice. Of course, the link is in my AIM profile and if you guys cared about our precious blog you'd put it in too! Anyway, that last sentence contradicts what I just said so... I don't know where I'm going with this, oh yeah! We need to make our blog more appealing than everybody else's crap on the net so the first step should be what I said. LiNK IN PROFILES. That is all.   END TRANSMISSION

       I do not have a friendship gauge. I just have a simple caste-system with 152 levels of friendship/acquaintance-ship. The levels range from "Punk-Ass Bitch" to "Rank 2 Soulmate". Which level you are on depends on a mere 26 factors.  1.  Length of time we have been acquainted. The longer we have known each other, the more I love you. 2.  Your physical beauty. Your face has to be as if chiseled out of stone, with features rivaling Brad Pitt's or Johnny Depp's. 3.  Your intelligence. In reality, I have to say that all of my closest friends are way above average in intelligence. 4.  Your gender. I just can't look at you the same if your boobies are bigger than mine. 5.  How big your package is compared to mine. Bigger? Ha! As if that is possible... 6.  How much of an asshole you are. I am the only one allowed to be a dickjob. 7.  How much of a push-over you are. The softer you are, the more respect I have for you. 8.  How I met you. Eh... where, how, whatever. 9.  Who your friends are. I would respect you much less if you were friends with Rebecca Tolman/Blas Diaz. Come to think of it... Blas DOES look a lot like Rebecca doesn't he? And if you rearrange the letters in Blas Diaz, you get Rebecca Tolman. What a revelation... 10. Who your parents are. It changes things in many ways. 11. If your parents hate me. To combat this, I wouldn't moon and get caught by your parents. 12. If my parents hate you. Things wouldn't be as easy if my parents hated you. 13. How much time we normally spend together. More time allows for more sexual bonding. 14. The special more memorable things that we have done. This differs from the time spent together. 15. Quirks you have. If you like sniffing my ass we might have a problem. But of course if you're not that bad and you're cool it doesn't matter. 16. What your skin color is. This ties in to the parents and my hate of Asian people. 17. Your taste in women. Especially if you're a girl. If you're a guy... I really don't give a shit unless you come onto me. 18. Your taste in music. Since I like almost everything... I'm musically attuned with you unless you like country a lot. But this one doesn't weigh that much anyways. 19. How close you live. The closer the better. 20. Stuff you do. Better if you have Starcraft or AIM or play basketball/go swimming. The more things we can do together/share in common the better. 21. Interaction with other friends/acquaintances. 22. Contracted STDs. If you have upwards of three and a half STDs, I will probably find you too much of a slut to be with. 23. Parent-Parent relationship. Basically, it would help if your parents were Chinese and talked to my parents or "co-mingled" with them. 24. How caring and not cold and calculating you are. Basically, as long as you don't laugh if say... get accidentally castrated. Before that point, anything's game. 25. Who you are, and what do you do. Gangbanger, thug, leader, etc... 26. How old you are. It does make a difference. Age gaps when you're in Elementary or High School makes a difference.  Holy shit, I made it to twenty six. Not only that, those are legitimate factors too. Booya. And sometimes making an excuse is necessary, or easier for the majority of the parties. Say if my parents hated a friend of mine and absolutely would not take him on a trip, what am I supposed to tell him? Or maybe its not that serious, but its just quicker and easier. And it is not worth posting everyday, but it would speed this blog up if you did. I might do it for the first few days until I am bored. And of course Grand-dickjob can exist with such an awesome person as I. We'll just rival each other on this blog. 'Twill be something to behold.

       What is friendship? I'm finding myself in a personal struggle to grasp the true meaning of it. I know I posses friendship with many people, but do these friendships contain gauge? Can we have friends that mean less then other friends? Should we? I mean, if in your mind you have a friend that you deem to be lesser than another friend you shouldn't really be friends with him or her. Right now, friends that are my mine are all on the same level as each other. Other people that I enjoy being that arn't friends are aquaintnces, people that I can't put before a friend. A big problem with having friends is sharing your time with friends and feeling torn between friends. People that do put gauge to friendship wouldn't have such a hard time. They would just humor which ever friend is higher to them, maybe trying to make some bogus excuse for the other friend so that it doesn't feel like it's being ditched or left betrayed. Right now I feel betrayed. I still haven't decided whether or not I will be posting in this blog once or twice a day. Is a day interesting enough to hold worth for two blog entries? Disappointingly(speaking for today) apparently it isn't. Also, making plans and posts for this blog is like preparing a meal for a dying man. I can be apprehensive due the current rate of decension. Is it possible for such conflicting entities such as Blas and Alex to exist on one plane in the information highway?

       Heh... don't forget that we LET you be the maker of this eye-crust we call a blog. Heh, if you didn't notice, my first post was basically directed towards you Blas, if you didn't catch the not-so-subtle hints. GrandMaster? More like Grand-Dickjob-with-erectile-dysfunctions! Ha! Enjoy, fatboy.

       Hmm... 5 Technical Fouls eh Alex? We'll see about that, don't forget that I am the supreme ruler of this fledgling blog and I'll edit yo' ass in a second. Nah, I guess I wouldn't do that... Anyway, way to steal my idea for your post from my other blog, also you stole words from Adam Sandler's songs. Come up with your own damn stuff you freakin' communist bastard. =)  That aside, I'd like to say your eye-crust post was exceedingly stomach wrenching Robert, was that your desired effect?  Not much else to say now besides that so I'll end my first post here.   P.S. I'll be expecting a witty remark from you Alex. And take heed, the GrandMaster doesn't like to be disappointed. Bitch. =D

                Eye-crust is one beast of a bitch. Especially for me, every morning that I oversleep I have to deal with task of eye-crust extraction which takes a bit of time, taking longer if I am doing other things like posting in a blog. You have to switch from doing whatever you are doing to rubbing your eye a bit, each time scrapping a small amount off, still leaving a sizeable annoying amount. But after awhile it becomes second nature, switching from task to extraction as a weaver weaves in and out with needle, thread, and piece. When finally reaching your goal of an irritatant free eye you can go back to your work with a bit more efficienecy feeling accomplished and relieved.   I can't find a reason to eye-crust either, only that it is one of those inconsiderate things that just get in the way and make your life harder for no particular reason.

       Some people would consider me a dotard for me writing on a "blog" at three in the morning, but I have something to say to that. Fuck off. I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm horny, and I need to take a leak. Besides, I have nothing better to do. Sleep you say? Well, sleep is for pussies. All a dark, handsome stud like me needs is lots of water and Rocky Road ice cream. A few gallons of testicle-shrinking Mountain Dew® will also do. Well, back to the task at hand. I seek to bring this blog forth from the obscure masses and crotch-thrust it forth into the limelight. But to do that we will need discipline. So here are the ground rules. If you are not me, and you post anything obscene about your pee pee on this blog, that's a technical foul. If you have one or more breasts weighing you down, you need to stop reading immediately and go back to cooking and cleaning/having babies. If you resemble either a) Blas Diaz or b) Rebecca T., in any way, you get five, count 'em five, instant technical fouls. The penalty for having a technical foul is painful circumcision. Of course the penalty is waived if you manage to do seventeen cock push-ups. There is more to come. I will keep you updated.
