       There are 10 types of people. Those who understand binary, and those who do not. (source  urlLink thinkgeek.com )    There is another people classification. Those who divide everything into two, and those who don't.    Regarding change in Indonesia. I think there are two types of people. Those who care, and those who don't. Those who cares can also be divided into two ... the evolutionaries and the revolutionaries.    The revolutionaries are those who want change, and they want them now, now, now! They want to create breakthroughs, they want to  change the system . They want to throw out the president and put a new one in. Revolutionaries are usually young, independent people, full of spirit and idealism. They want change to happen before their very eyes.     On the other hand, the evolutionaries are those who want change to happen slowly. They feel secure that whatever they are doing (whatever it is) creates a difference. Evolutionaries believe that the system is good, and  working in the system  will benefit people. For them, change can happen in 10, 20, even 50 years, and it will happen. They're usually older people, who's been through a lot. They know that sudden change will likely hurt someone, and that's what they're trying to prevent. They've spent 30 years under the same president, what's another 10 bad years.     The conclusion? There are many ways of creating change. Don't be mad at someone if he doesn't share your enthusiasm for change, he may be an evolutionary. On the other hand don't be mad at someone if he creates radical changes, which may do a lot of damage. He's probably a revolutionary

      It's 6.30 in the evening. Planned to go swimming, but it's raining. I don't want to walk in the rain. So here I am in the nearest starbucks (which is next door to the office), just waiting, drinking (needed something warm in my throat) and out boredom writing something for the blog.     It is these kind of times that I remember Indonesia.     Not the starbucks, I've never stepped inside a starbucks before coming in to the US. Come on Rp. 20.000 for a glass of coffee? Gimme a break. Even now when I look at the prices of starbucks I think, '$2 for a cup of coffee? Gimme a break.' The difference is here I can afford to buy a $2 cup of coffee.    There's a real difference in buying power. Everyone knows that. Not that I've got an instant solution (for once :) ). There's a blind beggar in this starbucks. He always comes in for a cup of coffee here. I know he's a regular because all the waiters/waitresses call him by name. Wonder what would happen if a beggar came to starbucks in Indonesia. Probably get kicked out.    I guess that'll be the sign that Indonesia has progressed economically. When a beggar in Indonesia can afford to buy a cup of coffee at starbucks.    Anyway, what I remember most about Indonesia is the rain. Yes.. the rain. The humidity in the air. The cool weather before the rain. The smell of water droplets. The building covered in a fine mist. I'd like to say the smell of earth after rain, except it's all pavement here in the US. It's little things like that which we usually take for granted that reminds me most of Indonesia.     The rain seem to be abating (even though I've only been here 10 minutes or so). I'll just finish my tea ($2.60 + 7% tax) and get out of here.

      I just had one of those ideas while sitting at my desk (well, maybe by walking around a little). It is (drum rolls please) ..... an online traffic fine payment for Indonesia.     The idea is, when a driver gets a traffic ticket. Instead of having to go and wait for a trial for paying a fine. The driver can plead guilty and just pay the damn thing online (through a credit card, or even a bank transfer).     It's not a new idea ( urlLink http://www.gov.ab.ca/home/index.cfm?Page=754 ). Others have used it. I believe it would be a good idea to implement it in Indonesia.     The advantages of this approach:        Cuts down on the number of police corruption (well, theoretically of course). The offender does not have to go to court. Thus it won't be any easier to pay the police off than paying to the court (it may be cheaper, but it won't be easier).      Cuts down on the number of illegal intermediary in court (calo/makelar). Since payment is direct and quick. Intermediaries are not needed.      More time for judges to do other things. Like giving death penalties to corruptors.     Some lucky group of IT developers will get money. What more do you want?       The main purpose of this system is of course to cut down the corruption in Indonesia. Ironically, the developers will probably have to make a big pay-off to people in the government to get this project rolling...

      The first phase of the Indonesian 2004 presidential elections was held in July. Current results show that either Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono or Megawati will be our next president. That depends on who gets the most votes in the second phase of the elections on september.      Now I'm confused on who to choose in the second phase. My original choice, Amien Rais was eliminated in the first phase. I thought that out of all the candidates, he was the only one that has the capability to really create change. Too bad other people didn't think so (or didn't care enough about change to vote for him).      Well what's done is done I guess. So I now have to choose between Megawati and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.      Megawati has been mainly an invisible president. She just doesn't show up. You wonder what she's done for the country at all. Megawati doesn't seem to have a vision on where this country is going. You feel that she's just a symbol, a vote getter, but you don't really know who's calling the shots. If there is actually any shot calling at all.    Susilo on the other hand is unproven. Well he made it to being a general, so that must mean something. The main problem I have with susilo is that he is from the military. The military is one of the main forces of corruption in Indonesia. How would a military man (who's been taught for thirty years that the army is his family) be able to be firm to the military?     There are also a whole lot of rumours about Susilo (wonder who started these rumours). The rumours with Susilo is that he is controlled by 'external' forces. Who? Well, it's not the martians.     Another choice would of course be, to not vote. Or 'golput' as the Indonesian call it. It's a simple way out. It means that I don't have to think my choices through.     One reason (stated by many people) is that by voting golput we weaken the legitimacy of the president. I don't believe it works that way. According to all the laws as I come to understand it, the president is still the president even if 90% of the population chooses not to vote. What's more, even if we do not vote, the president's actions would still affect our daily lives. Unfortunately we can't say, 'well I'm not gonna follow your laws because I didn't vote for you', that's not how this works.     I don't see a good reason to not vote. In fact, I feel that by not voting, we may actually find ourselves in the hand of the wrong president.     In this case it would be more correct to say the 'wronger' president.

      The first post is always a welcome post is it not? For the blogger, it is a gigantic moment, signifying the first step towards ... well towards making sure the blog is not deleted by the tacky administrators of the server for one thing.     Okay, joke asides (and not very good ones either :D). Let's go to a possible FAQ about this blog.     Q:  What is the purpose of this blog   A:  Well, Indonesia is a dump right now. It's chaotic, people are apathic towards everything. The poor is still poor, sick, dying. The rich is still rich. This blog is a collection of thoughts about the situation and hopefully some proposed solution.      Q:  What will be in this blog   A:  Problems, ideas, and grievances facing Indonesia.      Q:  Personal life?   A:  Maybe you'll get a glimpse of my life, but that won't be the main thing. I have a diary for that, and you won't be seeing it anytime soon.      Q:  Why is it in English?   A:  I tend to write better in english. More relaxed, it's just a style I'm used to.      Q:  Talk is cheap man... do something.    A:  Sure. Talk is cheap. Talk is easy. But at least I do it. How many people actually talk about the problem?

      Yes.. I'm going to talk about change again. But this time I'm talking about change to the template of the blog. The current template just doesn't work for me. Maybe because I talk too much, and it kind of makes this blog look like a textbook with a lot of text. Who wants to read that... I get dizzy just looking at it.  Well that's what happens when you use a template created by blogspot. Thing is... I hate designing :) :). I'm not a very good web-designer. I don't know the first thing about harmony of colours, or composition of objects or any of that stuff.
