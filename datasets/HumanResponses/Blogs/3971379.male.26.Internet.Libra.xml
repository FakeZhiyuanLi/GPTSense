      I found myself pondering that very question this morning because that's what its costing you and me for security at the DNC. $60 million - and for what? For a 3 day PR event? The conventions have no meaning in this day and age. There's no question that Kerry is going to be the Democratic nominee. There's no question that he's running with John Edwards. So why the party? The Replublicans are no better either. I'm sure it'll be at least as much to hold their convention in New York - and again, for what? In what way does this serve the American people? Our last election made it quite clear that the will of the people has very little to do with the outcome of the presidential election, So why the formalities? Why spend over $120 million just to put on a pagent to make the American people feel like they still have some role to play in democracy. I say save the money, spend it on something useful like yak herding, and stop the act.

      Shellhammer's has a half-price cheese steak on mondays. Its only $4 and its really not that bad. Certainly not Geno's, but still respectable. When I was in high school, and perhaps even before that, I had this little game I played with myself to get over what I later found out was depression. I'd pick one thing - anything - that I could look forward to on a given day. It could be something big like playing a show, or something small like - well like a half price cheese steak. The point was, I'd fixate on that one thing, and if at any point during the day I needed some sort of motivation or pick up, I'd just think about that day's thing and I'd feel all better. Anyway, there's a half-price cheese steak tomorrow at Shellhammers with my name on it. I'll be reminding myself of that around 6:30 when my alarm goes off.

      Went to a wedding party of sorts at Danny's parents house today. Denyce had to work so I had to go solo. There were lots and lots of kids there. A sure sign that you're in the suburbs. Kids running here and there, screaming, falling down, catching toads, and jumping in the pool. It was like a family circus comic. I've always felt somewhat uneasy around kids. I think its because I don't know what to say to them. I'm scared I'm going to say the wrong thing and leave them scarred for life. Then when they're 25 and picking random people off from an elevated position somewhere in America and the FBI is called in to talk them down, it'll be me that they'll blame when they're asked why they're doing this. Its just too much responsibility. Someone my age you can tell to fuck off and they'll probably forget about it in about 20 minutes, but kids are fragile. Their little minds are just soaking everything around them up and basing the way they'll feel about the world for the rest of their lives on what they see and hear. And not only are they emotionally fragile, they're physically fragile as well. Something as simple as playing catch can easily end in bloodshed as a result of nothing more than a fraction of over-exertion. So you can only imagine what was going through my head when Danny handed me a glove today to play catch with him and his nephew. Here I am hurling a projectile at this kid who's skull just recently firmed up - and this is supposed to be what fathers and sons do to relax. Maybe its because my own father and I never really played catch, but I really think its just sadistic. I remember playing baseball and my uncle's mother's house once and getting smashed in the back of the head by a ball and wondering - why is this legal? Who's decision was it to let kids play with these things? I guess kids are tougher than I think though because I was a kid and despite my many current emotioal imparments, I managed to live through not only the aforementioned game of baseball, but also ice hockey, street hockey, years and years of skateboarding, and the high school wrestling team. This of course coming from the guy who's back went out cleaning boxes out of his office not a few weeks ago, but that's not the point.  Danny's brother-in-law is getting sent over to Kuwait in a few months. Him, his wife, and 2 kids were there today. I had the chance to hear him talk about it briefly and to hear his wife talk about it. It really made me think. This is the same scene that's taken place in countless American homes over the last year or so and it doesn't look like its going to let up any time soon. The very thought of it was pretty damn overwhelming. His youngest is going to have long since said his first, second, and third words before he returns. Its really easy to divorce yourself from the reality of what's happening over there. To forget that its more than just pictures on a television and stories on cnn.com. Its real people going over there and risking their lives in a war that we have absolutely no business being in. These people really are heros, and my objection to the reason for sending them into harm's way should never be interpreted as a lack of support or respect for them.

      And I thought last year was bad when her birthday came around after we'd only been dating a month. But now its been over a year and I'm really supposed to know what she wants, what she likes. I've got a few ideas, most of them even good ones, but I just want it to be perfect. Why do I obsess over this? Somewhere deep down I know she'll love whatever I get her because I know she loves me, but I still can't help wonder - Is it enough? Is it perfect? Will she love it? So this is my task for the day. Wish me luck.

      My folks got me the first season on DVD last year for Xmas and I'm just now getting to watching it. I'm 3 episodes in and I'm totally hooked. I only wish our own president was 1/2 as interesting. This show makes me miss Clinton. Remember when we had a president who could you 3-syllable words without stumbling like a drunk?

      Long long day today, and a hot one at that. Moved a whole rack of servers for a customer to our other datacenter - and I thought I worked with computers because I *didn't* do manual labor. Got to play with OSPF static redistribution route-maps though which was a first and was really fucking cool. Went to dinner with Denyce tonight at that noodle place by the ritz in olde city. It was our first time going there and it was really yummy. I was kinda hoping that they had some crazy polynesian drinks in pineapples with crazy names like "virgin's demise", but no such luck.

      So I've been really getting the urge to play music again lately. All my equipment has been at Josh's house since last year's Hellfest, but I think I should really get it sometime soon. Maybe even do another band. Tom and I have talked about it on a few occasions and I think between us we could come up with something really cool. Besides, it would be really nice to have an outlet for frustration again that doesn't involve drinking myself to sleep.

      ...oh how i love thee, let me count the ways. I love they reuse the same actors from season to season for different characters. Like the DOD agent in Ghost in the Machine playing the city cop in Mind's Eye. Or like the SAC in the beginning of the Fight the Future playing one of the detectives in Sister. Cracks me up.

      ...for my Pulp Fiction poster. I opened it up only to find that the glass was cracked. Now I have to drive allllll the way back over to Peal and return it. I need to get one with a black background as it looks like the poster isn't exactly 24x36. Bummer. Guess I'll just get finish getting my drawers put together and do some laundry.

      This is one hell of a movie too. Saw it in the theater once and loved it. Bought the DVD and I watch it all the time. At first I didn't really care for vol 2 when I saw it in the theater, but after some more pondering I've decided that it was definitely as good as the first, if not better. Granted they were both replete with "Tarantinoisms" but is that really such a bad thing?

      This is a really underrated remake if you ask me. I saw it in the theater and I loved it. I later bought the DVD and I watch it at least once every couple weeks. Its one of those movies that even though I own it, if I'm flipping through HBO and I see it on, half-way through, I'll still stop and watch it. Denyce hates it because we've watched the second half like 20 times now.

      What a wonderful thing. Sitting around in my boxers watching xfiles season 5. I'll be done with season 5 soon though, which means its movie time, then on to season 6. Haven't been able to find season 6 anywhere yet though. I haven't tried the Tower on Broad St though. That's where I found season 5. I should read some today. Go the bean, get a bagel and read. I really hope work doesn't call me.

      First, if you haven't seen this movie yet and you plan to, stop reading now. Its definitely best that you know as little as possible about this movie going into it. My parents saw it a couple days before me and my dad ended up telling me just enough about it so that I figured out the plot long before Shyamalan revealed it. Nonetheless, the movie was GREAT. It was incredibly suspensful, had great visuals, and had an overall ambigulously creey feel that underscored every scene. The lack of overdone special effects was also really refreshing and really helped to give the whole story a very "it could really happen..." feel that really stuck with me. So much so that I had to talk to myself all last night while working in the datacenter alone to keep from getting creeped out. Finally, just as in Signs, Shyamalan had a bit part in this movie, though you might not notice it the first time around.

      Went to Atlantic City this weekend for Danny's bachelor party. It was a great weekend. The cast included Danny's brother-in-law Danny, Nick and RJ from work, Fong and myself. Our stretch SUV (as seen below) picked us up saturday night in front of Danny's apartment and wisked us away to The Borgata while we watched Star Wars in the back and got started on the weekend's drinking. We got there around 8:30, got checked in, and had a few drinks before we started playing. I started out playing Blackjack, but the tables were packed (well aside from them $100 tables - and I wasn't *that* drunk yet) so we started playing craps. You'd almost never know that I had NO IDEA what I was doing either. I just sorta followed Fong's lead and hoped for the best. As it turned out, once I figured out what the hell was going on, I was pretty good at it. Unfortunately, I still have yet to master the art of stopping before I lose everything I've won so I ended up about $50 under where I started. No biggie though - anyone who knows me knows that I've lost plenty more on past trips.   urlLink     Anyway, after a few hours at the Borgata we decided that it was just way too croweded and took a couple cabs over to Caesar's. We ended up playing craps there til about 3 in the morning. By the end of it, our group had the whole side of the table and chants of "Come on...baby needs a new 7600!" were heard far and wide. We headed back to The Borgata around 4AM, ate at NOW for a second time, and crahed for the night (er...morning). We got up around 10 and hit the breakfast buffet, after which we played some more craps while we waited for the limo to get there. We left around 1 and put in Empire Strikes Back as our entertainment for the ride back.   urlLink     urlLink     We got back to Delaware around 4PM and said our goodbyes. Despite being exhausted, Danny, Tianna, and I ended up going to the see The Village at that place that used to be Funscape. Its not quite as fun or scapey anymore, but its still a decent theater. That however is another post.

      I used a whole bottle of Drano tonight and its still back to normal. Its close though. I can feel it. One more bottle should do it. I'm going to start making little introspective notes like this like Mulder does in the X-Files game from now on. Its fun.

      This game just keeps getting better and better. This scene included the alien assassin shape shifter posing as Scully and was mostly a dream sequence not unlike those that Mulder experienced after Anasazi. Hell of a thing. In the next scene he returns to Tunguska, where he was originally infected by the alien black oil. There's a lot of references to the artifact episodes too which is making me remember how cool they were. Were they season 6? Season 7? I can't remember. Damn I've gotta get season 6 soon. And season 2 of The West Wing.

      I haven't been too into gaming lately and then I was in EB last week and saw this and had to pick it up. Since then I've been playing his game every chance i get. Its great! You basically play through what they describe as a "long lost X-Files episode". I did employ a few cheat codes that I found online, but that's only because I'm not really so interested in the game itself, just seeeing how they employ various parts and characters from the show in the storyline of the game. So far they've done a great job. I've run into Kirsch, Skinner, Cryczek, and there's been a few scenes of the cigarette smoking man too. I can't wait to see what comes next. Note to self - I really need to find season 6 on DVD soon.

      Along with The Rapture and Interpol. All in all it was a great show. The Rapture are always a lot of fun live and while Interpol wasn't exactly jumping out of their skin, they still sounded great. I was a little bummed that they didn't do more with the songs off Turn on the Bright Lights for the live show in light of how long that record's been out. It was pretty much like listening to the CD. They played some new songs too that were less than exciting. Very much like the last record, but with very little meat to them.  The Cure were absolutely spectacular. Robert Smith still has a great voice and really put his heart into the show. They opened with Plainsong which, while it wasn't what I expected them to open with, was the perfect choice. The rest of the set was all hits. Someday, Fascination Street, Lovesong, Faith, and finally Boys Don't Cry. I was amazed how good they sounded. Going into it my expectations weren't that high. I know Robert's getting kinda old and I just didn't know if he still had it in him. God was I ever wrong. From the first note I was captivated. By the time they got to Fascination Street, I didn't even realize it was the third song of the set.  All in all it was an amazing night and I've got to say that as much as I liked to new album before, I absolutely LOVE it now.
