      				seminar was ok....lots of common sense, but it's good to be told/reminded stuff. there are some worksheets and stuff that i think will be useful. open house was "a success," according to Don. Wonder if it still will look like a success when they see all of hte g&a hours put into it.

      				Tonight I'm going to a seminar, "Smart Women Finish Rich." It should be insightful. I wonder if i can still finish rich when I don't make enough to save?

      				on tuesday i was driving down our street to go get sandwiches and beer, and I passed a house with a huge dumpster out front, as well as some furniture. it looked very 50-60s, minty fresh era, so I stopped to look closer on teh way home. lo and behold, there are 6 chairs! 2 cool dining-room types, 4 metal-frame, orangepatterned vinyl ones. I drove home, convinced james to jump in the jeep, and we rescued them. will include pics soon. now i have to figure out how to make covers; it looks so easy on TS when hildi and laurie do it; I ran into corner-type problems when basting last night. another half-done project, and we have houseguests coming.

      				Today I am making an effort to be happy. I look nice, I feel good. When I got to work, I realized that there are a ton of bills that are unpaid (that's why I feel like I have too much money in my account....) Now I don't feel as good. :( I will shrug it off...I will. ok, off to work now.

      				yesterday i found out where my brother is. A city of about 443, 500 people south of Baghdad. He said they were "guarding" the city. as soon as i got to work i looked up where that city is, and any news about it. seems like there's nothing huge going on htere---not that thousands of "liberated' Iraquis looting the city isn't huge. I wonder if he has been in a doctor role at all, or what. james says he can't wait to pick rob's brain and ask him about what he's seen there, how he feels about it, etc. i don't know if i feel comfortable asking about that. it seems like an intensely personal thing.   i looked up guidelines for sending stuff to soldiers, and printed out 19 pages. too bad i forgot the address, b/c i could have saved about 16 or 17 pages by just looking up hte zip-ish code and seeing what restrictions apply. I also printed out a stack of name change documents, and plan on hitting hte SS office and DMV (or MVA in MD, will never get used to that) on thursday afternoon. it's james' birthday, and it was a ruse to get out of work early and thus get home early, but i hope it doesn't backfire.

      				the weekend flew by way too fast. friday night was fun; seeing the "band" was great, and James had a good time. saturday was a totally wasted day, however. we had brunch w/mark and his fam, but then went home and did nothing. i slept from about 3:30 till 10:30 without meaning to. went up for a nap b/c james was on couch and i was uncomfortable, and woke up at 10:34 totally confused. stayed up till 1 and went back to bed. woke up early sunday with a frantic sense of lost time. had flashes of hating life/work all day.   the good news is that i got all of the mosaic tiles on the cover of the album. maybe tonight i will grout. or tomorrow. need to do laundry too. realized yesterday that we won't be back till late on monday night, which blew my hopes of having part of monday off work. not that i'm not looking forward to this weekend, i am, but i have come to value my weekend days as my only "sane" days. man, do i need a working vacation. just a week or two off where i can make stuff, including plans, without having to interrupt my energy by coming to work. i just cannot give myself to this job. it won't happen. i realize that more and more every day.

      				It's amazing that a magazine can have power. I read a Self magazine last night, and it had great articles about setting goals, etc. This morning I rode the bike! For only 10 minutes, and it was long, but I did it. The test will be if I do it again tomorrow. I have been too complacent in my habits lately. I am slack about doing things I want to do, and slack about work, which makes me feel slack in other things. I don't want to keep this job forever, but I don't want to hate it while I'm here, or get fired either.   Today is the first day of the rest of my life. This is the first day that I feel that I have control over my future. I am setting goals, making plans. These goals lead up to, "In xxx amount of time, I will have paid off my credit cards. In xxx amount of time, I will have saved/made enough to start my business AND QUIT MY JOB." I don't know enough to know how soon these things will/can happen. Part of effective goal setting is making the goals realistic. For now, knowing I HAVE goals is enough to make me feel a little better.

Would you say that your desk is organized right now?   4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?   5.

      				Gown preservation. Is this the final cost of a wedding? Not including pictures, which could be a neverending cost. Although I saw a cool canvas collage on Exposures for $149 (on sale), and I checked around and found the same thing for under $25. Scammers. I can stretch it myself, and I can create the collage myself. In fact, I'd rather.  Need to make my mom a present tonight. I'm thinking a fabric-covered picture frame. Should be doable. Would like to work on my album cover, but am not going to have time

      				are you hard at work, not reading this until after the workday/weekend? are you in the library, taking a study break? are you on the road, crammed in a Wrangler? or are you at work, but with not a whole lot to do, SO happy that it's finally friday, since it's felt like friday since tuesday?  ...you guessed it, that last one is me.  After nearly 6 weeks of waiting, I finally have a definite status of my wedding proofs. They will be here next week. Yay! I sent a firm but kind email to Rodney today saying that I understand that he's busy, but I don't like being jerked around. (in nicer/more diplomatic words). He responded right away, apologizing, saying that the b&w proofs are done, but the color lab didn't give him prints up to his standards, so they're redoing htem, and they should be done early next week. He offered to send the b&w separately, and also threw in 5 free prints (which are about $20, so that's really generous!) I am now confident in my powers of persuasion/diplomacy/getting what I want.   I will now start working on our photo album--I'm making it out of wood, with a glass mosiac tile cover. Pretty cool---it'll probably look woefully thin when it's done; maybe the pages will have to be thich board or somethign to make it more substantial. I'm excited, and I get to use power tools to cut the board! I'm also working on the veil of Miss Annabelle, which is coming along nicely. Tulle makes you feel blind after a while, like looking through a screen and focusing beyond it, then on it, then beyond, etc.   Our neighbors, Jon & Michelle, are having a Cinco de Mayo party tomorrow. Hopefullly it will quit raining by the time it starts. Nothing like going to a party right next door--almost the convenience of getting drunk in your own house with none of the mess!   Tomorrow morning I'm going to pick up these two chairs that I got for free from a woman on a mailing list online. They're retro chrome and vinyl ones, and they're FREE! This is in addition to 6 chairs I picked up from a dumpster down our street last week. One man's trash...you know what they say. But now our house is in danger of becoming a chair farm.   Also, I took Kitty out on the leash last week. It probably looked pretty funny to passer-bys. We didn't walk; she doesn't know how. We just sat and she explored the front yard. Now whenever the door is being opened, she thinks she's going out. Oops. Maybe not so good. I want a dog, can you tell? Putting my poor cats on a leash...  Can't believe it's only 2pm. Not even. I didn't even take a lunch break. I told my boss 2 days ago that I needed work, but she's given me small stuff that I'm done with, and I don't feel like asking for a lot more. Yet. I will be a good employee, just not right now. Maybe I'llmake a list of all trips/gifts/otehr expenditures outside of the normal rent/food/utilities, etc for the foreseeable future. That will be a form of Setting Goals, which was emphasized in my Smart Women Finish Rich seminar I went to on TUesday night. I think the only person finishing rich these days is the guy getting the royalties from tehse seminars. I guess it was helpful. It's hard to think of saving lots for retirement when I just got started on this job rollercoaster thing. 65 is so distant to me. But putting 2% in my 401(k) is a start, better than nothing.

      				why oh why can't I still be in the days where getting spilled on didn't ruin my night?  Red wine, no less. Dripping from my eyelashes, all down my dress, covering the shawl draped on my arm--which otherwise could have covered up the dress.     Some Clemson asshole who James says was totally looking at my chest when he ran into me.     Of course my first reaction is to cry. It was my second glass of wine. If it had been my 5th or 6th, the first reaction could have been for me to yell at him, causing James to wonder if he was going to be forced to fight someone to back me up.    Later, at the bar after-party, wearing my Curious George t-shirt and shorts, dress soaking in the hotel, I see John (Clemson asshole) who tries to apologize once again, and then says that he's not sure whose fault it was, which negated the apology in my eyes. I said it was definitely his fault. This was many drinks later, and I was feeling a bit less cry-y, a bit more bitchy.     At around three, the bride went up to the groom in the suite we were all hanging out in and said that he had to come have sex while he still could, prompting a discussion of the Mach family and their resistance to or susceptability to, whiskey dick. With the groom's father.     A fatal car crash on route 85 just north of Atlanta that stopped traffic for 3 hours. Cars turned off, doors open, endless speculation and meeting of the minds in the middle of the highway. Me having to pee.    So, how were your weekends??

      				why do tuesdays always feel so terrible? someone urlLink   wrote something about tuesdays being melancholy, but to me it's much more than that. tuesdays feel desperate, like things just can't get any worse. now there are budget problems at work--we're way over for the rebid contract. if i dont' have my charge codes to dump extra time into, i don't know how i'll function.  i'm sick of coming to work i'm sick of playing timesheet juggle/let's see who gets billed i can't wait for this phase of total undecidedness, up in the air-ness to be over james needs a job, we need a budget we need a PLAN we need GOALS  i am sick of pretending to be interested in govt work. i don't really care if kids do drugs i don't really care if we get the rebid being chained to a desk sucks the only things my hands touch all day are the keyboard, mouse and phone. nothing is produced. nothing is changed. my mind does not grow. THAT's my problem.

      				i had a breakdown last night. an extended crying jag that lasted over an hour. my eyelids are swollen; i was on the couch for an hour this morning with ice on them, but they still don't crease in the correct spots.  i feel terrible for making james feel more inadequate by being unemployed, but i can't help but feel trapped here by health insurance, mostly, and the knowledge that if all else failed, i could at least cover our rent if nothing else. health insurance is necessary, i guess, but right now it only really benefits me by giving me cheap birth control. teh whole idea of insurance is to INSURE that IF somethign happens, we won't go broke. i know that, but it still seems liek a waste. so james said that when he gets a job, i can go on HIS insurance and quit this job, and do what i need to do. i am just praying for that day. i can make it, i think.

      				 Leaves?    Last night I had a dream. I was looking in the mirror, checking my skin for clogged pores, blackheads, etc. I pushed my nose aside to look in the nose crease on the left side of my face, and I saw the end of a stem under a thin layer of skin. I scratched the skin off and tried to grab the stem. As I did, my skin started peeling back, and an entire leaf was under a layer of my skin. Under the leaf was the raw-looking skin that looks like it's bleeding but isn't.  The leaf was wet, and small, maple-ish, and brown. It was as if a leaf from last winter had tried to find a hiding place. I went to show James. No idea what his reaction was. Dream was over.

      				It's been a long time. Over a month. In that month there has been the last wedding of the year, the last forseeable bridesmaid dress-wearing time for me. Yay! Maybe I'll be able to spend my money on things I want...wait, no, Christmas is coming up. Need ideas for good presents for the kiddies. Seven of them. Ages 10-1. Yep.

      				those that know me know that i am constantly making stuff. many things never make it out of the "prototype" phase, meaning that i have grand plans to perfect them and sell them to one and all, but i keep "refining the design," which really means "making myself cool stuff." maybe it's just because i am so attached to my creative efforts, maybe i'm just afraid that someone will purchase an item and discover all its shortcomings, maybe it's both of these things and more.   however, this weekend will be  bGum's Sewfest 2004 . that's right, the thread will be flying this weekend as i savor my opportunity to spread out my projects all over the downstairs with no hesitation, knowing that my beloved will not be bothered by me sitting on the floor cutting fabric right in front of the tv. when he gets back in town sunday night, all that will be left of  Sewfest 2004  is a pile of freshly created fabric goodies. that's a promise.   update:  results of Sewfest 2004 are two skirts, not yet hemmed, and lots of ideas.

      				so now james has a name for my fits of rabid craftiness. a day overcome with the need to create is called "making day." makes total sense, really.  this weekend's making days goals were: 1. design modifications to wallet styles 2. design receipt-holder for melissa 3. make one of each style  accomplishments: 1. done. 2. done, though needing reworking (see below.) 3. mini-mod: done except button. receipt-holder: almost done, but major design flaw exposed. needs redesigning.  I am officially off bags, at least the big type I can carry all of my stuff in.  Reason? The latest one I've been carrying around didn't meet my needs, both use needs and looks needs.  i found the perfect bag at south moon under, and I snapped it up. a picture is emailing itself from my phone to the computer so i can post it, but dreamhost is down....again. bleh! i am getting sick of this. will add it later. it's awesome. it's orange.    edit: here it is!

      				after that one teaser day of 75 degree weather a while ago, followed by COLD, it seems like spring has (maybe?) arrived for real. today was so gorgeous. it puts me in a much better frame of mind, although it's a little harder to work. everything in life is a trade-off, though, no?

      				we were waking up in our house for the first time as a married couple. we were packing for our mini-moon to st. michael's. we were thinking about how things seemed the same, but different. i felt like life afterwards should get to be better; i would get to have a job i liked, james would get a job at all. the house was a mess; pre-wedding neglect plus days away equals messy. especially when you add unpacking/packing. the cats had no idea things were different. they just knew we were back and they were hungry, and that the food in their bowls, while ample in quantity, was just a little too stale for enjoyment.  this past weekend, out in the social world, we were made to reflect on the fact that yes, we had been married almost a year. saying it to other people made it seem like a point of pride. look at us, we are successful as a married couple. it wasn't until sunday, in the kitchen making our super-special anniversary dinner, that we reflected together. james said to me that this has been the happiest year of his life, cutting me off just as i was about to remind him to rinse glasses out before putting them in the dishwasher. i paused, feeling guilty about what i had been about to say. me too, i answered. then i laughed and told him what i was about to say about the dishwasher. mundane, yes. real life, yes. happiest ever,  yes .  may this have been the worst year of the rest of our lives. i feel certain that it will unfold that way.

      				i will track every dollar i spend. i will attempt to stretch every dollar i spend. i will attempt to pay off my cc debt in under two years.  urlLink Here is a calculator to see how long it will take with certain payments.  For me, right now, it will take $400/month to pay this off in 2 years. ouch. not sure if that's possible.

      				the mouse makes your hands tingly-numb and swollen when you use it for a full day. i should have gotten a belt sander--not really, but it took a LONG time to sand down the finish on the dresser. it's oak with a nice light stain, plus a black-based stain that is only black in the grain and sinks WAY down, plus an impenetrable shellac. I got fed up on the drawers and got some stripper for the frame, but still had to sand.   this sounds like a frustrating experience, but it really wasn't. it was a beautiful weekend, i was on the screened in porch, and i got great satisfaction out of seeing the results of my hard work. i did go to the hardware store three times in one weekend, but that's ok. the first was for the original materials, the second for the stripper and more coarse sandpaper pads for the mouse, the third for blue paint when i decided that the inside and sides of the drawers and cabinet section would look really cool blue (and i wouldn't have to sand!). they recognize me there, i think.   i also spontaneously decided to paint a blue rectangular design on the bathroom walls, since the blue i got was the blue of our shower curtain liner. it looks cool, and it will (hopefully) be easy to repaint white when we move out.  i've been taking pictures of the progress of the dresser, from before to almost-there. i still have to give it a final light sanding and coat of poly (the third!) and put the handles on, which should arrive early next week. will post when it's done.

      				i ordered a handheld power sander (a black & decker mouse, to be specific) from amazon so i can sand down and refinish the dresser this weekend, and the shipping estimate is march 8-10, which is too late. however, i have been tracking it on ups, and from yesterday to today, it went from IL to PA, and the distance from the place in PA is much shorter than IL to PA was. maybe it will arrive tomorrow!!!

      				   i brought in some fun-patterned fabric to cover my wrist support by my keyboard. it was $2.77 a yard, and i bought 3 yards. it's soft and pretty.     i had an idea about how to make the strap on the purse i'm making tonight better and i can't wait to get home and do it   i  love  nike dri-fit fabric. i bought three shirts, and now i wish they made sheets, pants, everything out of it.    the 90s indie channel on spinner is the  best ! it keeps playing awesome music like pavement, jicks, aluminum group, stereolab, sea & cake, etc.....love it! and, since my office-mate is away, i don't have to wear headphones!

      				i take in stray furniture. i think that if i could, i would also take in stray animals, but there are things preventing that: renting our house, working full time, ongoing upkeep costs, emotional attachment, you get the idea. stray furniture is much easier--it's free or low-cost, sometimes takes some money to fix up, but after that it's only requirement is space. which we do not have. stray furniture we have at the moment: -tall dresser (acquired from my brother-in-law this weekend, requires full refinishing--plus there's another in their garage that we couldn't fit) -table and four chairs (50s, circular table, painted all legs, began upholstering chair pads) -two straight-back fully upholstered dining chairs (pottery-barn style, yet authentic, acquired at a dumpster down the street, nearly completely reupholstered, needing tacks down the sides) -four orange and brown metal and vinyl chairs (acquired from same dumpster, scrubbed, frames repainted--complete) -three aqua and white chrome framed chairs (acquired for free from a listserve) -glass and metal oval two-tiered beverage cart (acquired by j from a plumbing job for free, metal repainted) -two nice antique radio consoles (acquired from j's grandparents) -one crappy old radio console (acquired in a trade by me--for painting designs in a friend's bathroom) -one glass dining room table (acquired for $40 from a listserve) -one large clawfoot dining room table with leaves (acquired from j's family) -one antique sideboard (acquired from j's family) -one 50s couch ($85 at a consignment shop) -one swivel rocker ($35 at same consignment shop--at dump now, since we bought a La-Z-Boy) -one bedroom set (bed and dresser with mirror; tall dresser is at j's brother's in Phoenix, acquired from j's family) -one Hitchcock coffee table (from j's family)  I'm pretty sure there's more, but you get the idea. our house is chock-full. and i have a new project for this weekend:)

      				that's right, i didn't know how to ride a bike. i reached the age of 25 not knowing how to ride a bike. have i been ridiculed? yes. have i been stubborn? hell yes. i finally decided recently that i was not going to turn 26 not knowing how to ride a bike. i was going to suck it up and learn, dammit. and it was going to happen this past weekend.  sunday morning, we woke up and called the bike place. as we were getting ready to go rent one, i had visions of some cool bike person making fun of me because  i don't  i didn't know how to ride. i was near tears. seriously. was this really a good idea? nevertheless, we were on our way.  people at the bike shop were very cool--no big deal that i didn't know how to ride. we picked a slightly smaller bike, a Gary Fisher Gitchee Gumee (funny name), and loaded it in the car. we went to the nearby school, thinking i was going to start out on the grass, since it hurts less. as we neared the fields, a stream of 7-10 year old boys and their dads began trickling onto the fields. oh no! not little boys; little boys are the worst! ever since i was walking down the boardwalk with a funnel cake and a seagull dove at it and flew into my head and little 8-year olds laughed at me, i have feared the riducule of little boys. (although that seagull incident must have looked pretty funny.)  i panicked. we headed for the parking lot. after allowing a few cars to park and unload, we got started. i was getting my humor back. a man pulled up with two small kids and two small bikes, and said that he had some learners too. i actually was able to laugh.   so, now the learning. james held on to the handlebar and the back of the seat and had me pedal. i'm not sure if my reluctance to have him hold up  all  of my weight played a part, but i found myself balancing without even knowing it. "i'm barely holding you up at all," he said. after just a few minutes of this, he asked if i was ready for him to let go. i was. success! i was a big girl! stopping, shifting, turning, i've got it all down. one sore ass later, i am a bike rider.  urlLink this  is what i hope will be my birthday present.

      				last night we went to stereolab. mice parade opened, and they were actually pretty cool. after last time's quasi performance (that was the name of the band, and they were terrible), we were wary of the opener. but mice parade was interesting. i'd like to hear how they translate in studio.  stereolab was great. without mary, the vocals were spare and less haunting, since they did nothing to replace mary's parts. the songs were tight and powerful, all except for the last 2 in the encore, in which they felt the need to do the droning thing that is the one thing i don't like about earlier stereolab albums. by then it was 11:20, which is about 2 hours past my usual weeknight bedtime, and i was fading fast.   we got home to find our maryland tax return check, which was about 15% of what we expected it to be. $950 we won't be getting but were expecting, thanks to a mistake from our accountant in which she put us as exempt from local tax. i'm mad, but mostly panicky about not having the money, which was going to help bail us out of our hole.  anyone got a shovel?

      				the weekend after james' parents visited was easter weekend, and i went up to pa. during easter dinner appetizers i developed strep throat. went to the doctor monday only to find that they no longer accept our insurance, went to cvs to pick up amoxicillin, only to nearly faint in there, got a ride home from a really nice woman only to have to pick up my car later. missed two more days of work, bringing me farther into the negative.   last weekend was full of absolutely gorgeous weather. james' band came over to play in the afternoon, and while they played, i sat outside sipping a limeade cocktail or several and read my bookclub book. it was james' birthday, and after they left, we had a few more beers, decided to not cook dinner, and went out. a really perfect day.  sunday was 90 degrees. i finally got my car cleaned, vacuumed, and pinstriped! it feels like a new car. tonight we go see stereolab. that's all i have for now.

      				i was in a store this weekend that sells really cute clothes that are pretty pricey, mostly rightfully so and/or due to the fact that they're expensive brands. the store also has accessories. i saw that they had ribbon belts and quickly hurried over to check them out, since i had recently purchased materials to make a ribbon belt myself. they were $28. for oh, two ribbon lengths, two D rings, and (i think) some webbing inside. total materials cost: about $4. yes, horrifying. i went home and made mine instead of continuing to put it off. it took me about 20 minutes, and mine is a) more complex than the ones i saw and b) much cuter! i am sporting it today. here it is.

      				lately i've been thinking about drawing.  Sites like  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  have helped spur these thoughts. there was a time that i was drawing all the time, and i was good at it. it's been years since i was consistently drawing, and it shows whenever i attempt it. yesterday i resolved to begin a journal, one with words and pictures, but mostly pictures. i will use pen and be unrepentant about my efforts. i will force myself to keep at it until it comes back to me. i know it will, it will just take some self-inflicted ego wounds.   i'll get started as soon as i make the journal. and a little thing to hold my pens. i have all of the materials. just need some time.
