      Sometime in September of last year, my friend and I sat in some random Red Lobster in the middle of NJ, wondering what sassy saying we could toast to. After having just jumped out of a plane for the first time, we both thought we had a new outlook on life and were trying to find a perfect way to sum up our newfound desire to live life as wildly as possible. We finally decided to toast to New Beginnings. It was in September and the new school (law school) semester had just begun and it seemed as if the world was full of wonderful and crazy adventures.  Well, it's nine months later and not only has our friendship ended, but it seems as if all of the crazy and wonderful adventures that I have experienced in that period of time haven't been that exciting at all. If anything, in these last few months i've been somewhat forced to constantly examine who i am and what i want out of life on a somewhat daily basis. and at this point, being completely and utterly drained of emotion and feelings, i am still no closer to identifying those things than i was 9 months ago. in fact, the only thing that i've realized is that i am totally desparate and afraid (i'm borrowing that saying from a friend). and it's funny, b/c i'm starting to realize that a lot of people really feel that way, but are afraid to say so outloud, especially women, b/c they'll be pigeonholed into all of these pathetic stereotypes of single, alone women living in Manhattan trying to find love and all that jazz. But hey, i said it and i think it's a positive first step.  see, i'm a complet and utter television and movie junkie. i make all different types of references in life from television shows and movies. one of the greatest movies ever made was what about bob with bill murray. i think you can go through everyday of your life making at least one quote from that movie that makes sense in any given situation. hence the title of my blog - Baby Steps. Bob was taught to take baby steps to get through life and i find that the greatest advice anyone could give.   so my first step in this whole looking-for-love-self-discovery thing is realing that i'm not only desparate and alone, but i'm confused as hell as to what and who i want and ultimately who i am. is that normal for 25 year old? who knows? who knows what's actually normal? all i know is that being the control freak that i am, i've given myself until the end of the summer to figure this all out. I admit that i might need some help, so feedback is welcome to whoever is willing to read this (constructive criticism).   i guess that's all for now.  E
