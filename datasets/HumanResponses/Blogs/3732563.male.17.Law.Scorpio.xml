      Oh I say, this blog is simply capital!   well yeah hmmm...Had a fucked up dream about Toilet parrots and tribal guys with machettes, but we won't go there.   Went to loch's place today, met his friend Ben, who is quite the Capital chap!   Matt had a simply sensational Capital shot in darts and smashed the outside light. Capital entertainment that! When Loch's mummy returned Matt faced "Capital" punishment.   oh I say! Capital!   Thief is still in the "Capital" of Queensland. How you doing down there Thief? Is the feeling quite Capital?   Well this Capital old chap is off to do some music practice!   oh Capital!

      "Everyone I know Goes Away in the end..."   Even Ya rassoul allah (sala alaho alaihi wassallam) has left me...So to save everyone the pain, misery and hassle, I shall become a social recluse, and keep myself to myself.   "One man is ill fit to govern his own actions, let alone those of others..."- Juan Marcados  That is why I am&nbsp;'leaving', because I don't deserve amazing people like you (who&nbsp;are good enough to read my shit of a blog)...so, to save you all the hassle of having to deal with me, put up with me, humor me&nbsp;etc. I'll stay away.  So guess this is cya later  I bid you all a very fond farewell,  Much Love  El Fahey&nbsp;

      well, &nbsp; Since fish seems to almost incessantly ask me about "what I want to be" , I have given it considerable thought and come up with this. &nbsp; As mentioned in a previous post, I should very much like to become a wandering blues man. But also more then that! A pistolero without the pistols, a sufi mystic without the dogma, a bush doctor without the " 'erbs ", a dalai kwoung without the begging bowl, an academic without a field, and a Man without a care in the World!  &nbsp; I shall wander from place to place playing and learning music, and learning in general. I will walk ancient and new roads, meeting old and new people and&nbsp;sharing life in general. That's what I wanna do, so don't knock it!  &nbsp; and no thief I won't "walk away" from my problems, I will just walk.  &nbsp; el fahey&nbsp;

      I am tired of all the pragmatisms and boring realities of “every-day life”, so I have decided to change it. The first step in changing my life will be the recreation of myself as a wandering blues-man, and I shall henceforth be known as “Blind Rufus Johnson”. I shall wear a suit, but fear not! I shall not be some yuppie or upper-class blues-man. No; I shall remain unkempt and sleep in my suit, thus ensuring my blues-man nature and persona remains very much intact. My only cares shall be the procuring of a steady supply of strings for my geetar, and of some matches, with which I shall create fire; both as a base requirement for survival and also by setting other things alight as a perverse form of entertainment.  I shall travel only along operating rail-lines, as this is befitting of a true wandering blues-man. I would ride in the carriages with the other Hobos, except that Hobos get welfare now and so have no need to ride on the railways. So I shall sit alone in the carriage (except for my equally unkempt and quite mad and eccentric biographer, who shall document my exploits and troubles as a blues-man in a bemoaning book, which will no doubt be made into a high grossing telle-movie/documentary at a later date, cementing my legacy to the world of blues) playing my blues and howlin’ like a wolf. Yeah I’ll probably also keep updating this blog…So don’t be too worried about me, just worried enough to buy my albums ensuring the beginning of my blues legacy.  Ciao all “Blind Rufus Johnson”

      hey all,  Just recently had the pleasure of listening to some Michael Bublè (pronounced Boo-blay), who does the new spider man theme song.  But, his best cuts are definately renditions of the old Sinatra and Van Morrison (amongst other greats)  standards.  If you like jazz, are looking for something different, or have ever thought about listening to some jazz (or even if you haven't!) then give him a listen! well worth your while!  well good night all!  el Fahey

      I am appealing to anyone who happens to read my blog to live more simply so that others the world over may simply live.  Give up what you don't really need, restrain your appetites. Appreciate what you have, and what has been given.  So many millions of people are starving, are dying, are living uneducated, and are being exploited (consciously or unconsciously) by you and me.  Care and compassion is what I am asking. Please, do your part to make this a better and fairer world for everyone!  much love  el Fahey
