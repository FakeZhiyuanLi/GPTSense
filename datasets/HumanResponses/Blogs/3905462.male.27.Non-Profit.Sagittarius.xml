       Holy Biscuit church was awesome today! Some of you might not understand that comment. First you would have to know that I attend one the greatest churches in the world. It is called  urlLink New Spring Community Church . If you are ever in or around Anderson, SC come by and check it out. If you have had bad or boring experiences in church in the past, I assure you  urlLink New Spring  is not what you think. Today we got to listen to several people talk about what Jesus has done and is doing in their lives. It was positively incredible. Not to mention the band, if any of you guys and gals happen to read this I just have to say that Jesus ROCKS through you all.   This weekend I also got to go to the DMV and brighten up their day just a little bit. Seriously, how incredible is it when Christ works through us for the benefit of others. It is amazing what God can do when we rest in Christ and allow Him to live His life through us.   Here is a thought...what if the Christian life was supposed to be simple? Not without troubles, but simple. Good news! It  is  supposed to be simple! Check this out:      "But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ. (2 Corinthians 11: 3)      Kinda cool huh?   Saturday I got to go to a surprise party for a friend of mine named Sarah. I met some really cool people and we had a great time. Who would have thought that I could have that much fun playing "Marco Polo?"   Today I got to cut some grass. As I was getting ready to do so someone stopped by and asked if I cut cut their grass as well. I figured "why not." Let me tell you...that yard kicked my tushy. I wanted to do it for free but he wouldn't let me leave without paying me. How cool is God that He would give me that kind of opportunity right when I needed a bit of money? Yay God!!   Well I suppose that I am going to relax for a bit while I wait for the most wonderful girl in the world to give me a call. (Quick explanation: My girlfriend, Dixie, is currently at her parents' place in Florida. She will be back at Anderson College in about 3 weeks. Praise God!)

      Some very close friends of mine, as well as myself, find this verse very cool.  I figured I would share it with you all.  Philippians 1:6  For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.  As we learn to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we will realize that the perfecting does not come from us.  The more we learn to allow Christ to live His Life through us we will begin to really live.  Yay God!  More on this subject later!

      Isn't today awesome?  How cool is it that we (Christians) can enter into a day with the knowledge that we are God's kids.  How amazing is it that He loves us as much as He does Jesus?  I know that today is going to be an incredible day.  I'll tell you more about it later.  For now I need to get working.
