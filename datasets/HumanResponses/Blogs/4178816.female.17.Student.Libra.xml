        My tears have gone out im freezing I’m getting cold and I with a slight shrill a feel my heart breaking into pieces. I wanted to cry, i wanted to explode, like a  tiny gas filled balloon poked by a sharp needle. I’m a victim of love which i never really wanted it just came and HIT me HARD....so hard that i can't move.. i can't breathe    It's 12:45am but my eyes won't shut down, still I can't believe and still I think of the love i've lost...YOU....the person whom i loved with all that i am, was finally out of reach. I never knew that giving all is not enough, It's hard to find happiness and constantly give it BUT it's harder to let go of the feeling which serves as your cane in this lifetime journey.     I never knew that the love that dominates me for a couple of years was killer it made me feel ill..it made me feel weak..My strength have run out and i have lost the meaning of life..I have lost you   It's hard to remove all the memories.... it runs in every inch of me from my veins thru my spines...from the tons of morning messages to the excitement of being together plus the joy of killing time in all those amusement parks...These moments won't definitely won't fade out It's the biggest part of my totality.     Goodbye is painful it's not easy to blurt it out but i rather say goodbye than seeing you unhappy and un-contented for the rest of my life ..I'd rather feel the pain that your memories have caused rather than to live with the suffering which your eyes express    Im willing to let you go with no pretensions no hesitations no hatred....but I’m hurting....I love you and always will be...Thank you for the memories... ***may you be blessed,and find true happiness*** ***may feel loved, even in the rare places*** ***may you live, with your own choices***

         Why is it sometimes it's hard for us to say our thoughts?!! It's hard for us to speak our mind and  make something concrete out of the millions of ideas which is flowing in our neurons..the answer in this question is something that interests me...I really wonder what hinders our courage to move, to speak, to be TRUE...    Consequences, probably this one of the reasons why speaking out is hard for most of us...I think other than the consequences that will come out..Fear is one of the factors which halts us!!     We have this fear of saying things that is out of ordinary..Fear of being secluded because of the miss matched ideas..Fear of offending someone who means so much to us...and this is where the sad part begins..    I wonder how many failed relationships occured just because of our being timid and being silent?..how many familes broke up because of the absence of communication?..how many relationships ceases without even plunging into it, only because of not letting our feelings explode?...     There is really one thing that I have realized..It's importance of expressing our thoughts...letting our grievances flow..letting our mind speak out..and be true to our feelings..   ---and why am i righting this?!!! i don't know...Just wanted to speak my mind---

      ..whew..i've been staring at my screen for about fifteen minutes and i stll can't think something tangible to write..it seems that im  under a time pressure competition or its just my ideas have blown up..Im not a good writer i know..my work wasn't made of a genius..my perceptions maybe shallow at times and my opinions can't pass for an editorial page.. But writing is my only escape through the complications of the world wherein i can expres myself with no hesitations nor limitaions...this is just being me... i may not be good but i can i try to be best....hope this thing works..=)
