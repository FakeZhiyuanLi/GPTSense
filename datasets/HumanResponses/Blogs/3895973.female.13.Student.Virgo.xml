      I was born in phoenix and i lived there until i was about 7, Then i moved to cotten wood i lived in a house there with my mom, brother, sister in-law and there kids. My brother got a bed for my neice from a hospital so people had died in it so it was like haunted and it made the whole house haunted, at night i would see little kids run from the hall way to the kitchen and i would see people out side but i didnt know it was haunted then so i was really scared of that house my mom told like a year after when we were moving out, but i think its pretty cool now and i beleave in ghost. after that we moved back to phoenix and nothing really happend then i met a few people had a little fun then we moved AGAIN lol this time we moved to tucson we lived in a little apartment there and i went to this school were i was like the coolest girl in this group i hung out with lol which is weird cause i didnt know why i was but i went along with. It around that time my dad who was having lung probles was move from a hspital in phoenix to UCLA. I was scared cause he was like the best dad and i really missed him since my mom and him broke up when i was like 7. After my dad lung transplant he was starting to get better until he started having heart probles a few months later he had a heart transplant but it didnt help to well and we knew he was dieing so my mom was going to take me to visit himone last time but she picked me up from school and said that there was no way we could get there in time to see him i was really upset i felt like going out and killing myself and i was only like 9 or 10 after he died in january of 2000 we move north a little to a town called oro valley i loved it there i met alot of great friends and well one not so great, her mom was crazy and spray painted her porch say weird stuff and said that me and my friends haley and nicole did it then she put a restraning order on us we went to court to try to get rid of it and we won so her and her family moved back to holland were they came from. Around that time these guys travis and tyler moved in to where i lived they were brothers and really really cool. Travis was the hottest guy ever he liked me and i liked him but he didnt know i liked him and i was really shy, one day he asked me out but i was scared and said no (what the hell was i thinking?) he got over me but i was still like in love with him. I was staying over at a friends house i was like 11 then and we were playing a game on her balcony and writing on these cards that said __name__ i think your smokin! and we were writing in travis, my friend haley through them over the balcony and it was about 2am and we couldnt go outside so the next morning we got up early and went to get them before anyone found them and there werent there it turns out that his mom found them and knew we wrote it so she told him, and we didnt know she did. He moved a few months later and everyone else started moving then i had to move back to phoenix i missed it there so much i never had so much fun. Every now and then i would go back to visit a friend who still lived there and one day i was talking to her on the phone and she said the travis had moved back into the apartment complex so i planned a trip to go down there cause i really needed to see him but he was away at motox that weekend so i didnt get to see him. about a year later my friend was moving to south carolina and i knew i wouldnt see her in a long time. :(  Like 3 months after she moved me and my other friend haley who had moved to phoenix after me went up to visit and we saw travis and all are other friends and travis was even hotter but it was kinda weird cause we hadnt seen them it a long time and they were kinda spoiled but still hott, we had a fun time there but we didnt stay for long 2 months after that and about 2 months ago now my friend haley moved to oregon where she lives now and i havent seen her since but i still talk to her and her sister nicole alot and now i still live in phoenix....again i hate it here and would do anything to go back to oro valley :D

      My life is kinda weird even though i dont really have to much of one. Most of the time i play The Sims Online and i dont really sleep alot im mostly up from 6pm-11am i like the night its alot more peaceful, I guess the day is just well to bright haha. I like to watch tv i have a couple favorite shows and thats the only thing i watch. I dont date to much i guess i just havent met anyone that i feel comfortable around.
