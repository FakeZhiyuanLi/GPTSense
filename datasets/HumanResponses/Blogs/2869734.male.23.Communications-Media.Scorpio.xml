      Today i read in some magazine that "love is a bio chemical process that is triggered off in a small corner of one's brain when it gets the 'right neurochemical impulses'.....". What the f**k !?^$@#!^? Yeah thanks. Next they'll come up with some theory about how love and other emotions can be expressed an an infinite series of partial nth degree retro-harmonic semi - orthogonal functions. What is it with these people.. bored psychologists...morons. Ok so maybe there is some link between specific brain activity and love-like emotions but why trivialize it so much and make it sour. These guys even go to the extent of saying that the love between a mother and her child is because of so and so neural impulse in so and so part of the brain... thats really cool mr.scientists but all i'm saying is that when you know that your 'love' for someone is no more tha some bio-process in some nook of your brain its kinda ...well disappointing. I guess thats because we humans have a much more  respectful image of ourselves and our emotions. Its disheartening to know that you are just a biological process that will end someday like all processes. The're no dignity.. nothing special about us. Just a very complicated biological system. period.

      Ever wondered what it is about booze that gets people going ? How is it that the simple looking colourless liquid (I'm talking about Romonov btw) makes even the deepest emotions tucked away in the corner of our hearts come chirping out. Heh heh... another brilliant testimony to this effect was on display on my hostel terrace (and later in BluePussy's room). There was laughing, crying, yelling and lots and lots of story telling ;)   I'm not going to write about the intricate details of the storytelling but let me say that now we all know each others families really well... on a first name basis...down to second cousins n all. Then there are some people who are simply unaffected by booze. One wonders what the're made of really.... Take RG for instance. Sober as an upside down tree! Keep it up RG.

      Don't try to love someone. Don't even think about it. It will lead you to pain and misery. All attachment is futile. All emotion is mortal. But I don't ever give up, do I ? Fall once, Jump again. Fall again, jump again.   Every day the beauteous daughter  of the Sultan walked up and down  in the evening by the fountain  where the white waters splash,   Every day the young slave stood  by the fountain in the evening,  where the white waters splash;  every day he grew pale and paler.   One evening the pricess went up  to him and said suddenly:  "I wish to know your name,  your country and your kindred!"   And the slave said:  "My name is Mohamet,  I am from Yemen,  and my tribe is the Asras  who die when they love."

         I was reading an introductory article on game theory today when I came across the phrase "doomsday device".. something that I'd heard in the movie ' urlLink Dr. Strangelove '. I didn't know this doomsday thing was for real! Apparently it was... the movie, ofcourse, is a satire.       The nuclear arms race that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union after WW II, led to the formation of an instance of a classic problem variant, known in Game theory, as the  urlLink Prisoner's Dilemma . Both the USA and the USSR maintained the following policy: If one side launched a first strike, the other threatened to answer with a devastating counter-strike. This pair of reciprocal strategies, which by the late stages of the cold war would effectively have meant blowing up the world, was known as ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’, or ‘MAD’. Game theorists objected that MAD was mad, because it set up a Prisoner's Dilemma as a result of the fact that the reciprocal threats were incredible. Suppose the USSR launches a first strike against the USA. At that point, the American President faces the following situation. His country is already destroyed. He doesn't bring it back to life by now blowing up the world, so he has no incentive to carry out his threat, which has now manifestly failed to achieve its point. Since the Russians know this, they should ignore the threat and strike first! Of course, the Americans are in exactly the same position. Each power will recognize this incentive on the part of the other, and so will anticipate an attack if they don't preempt it. The expected outcome is therefore a race between the two powers to be the first to attack.    This game-theoretic analysis caused genuine consternation and fear on both sides during the Cold War, and produced some rather bizarre attempts at setting up strategic commitment devices. President Nixon, for example, had the CIA try to convince the Russians that he was insane, so that they'd believe that he'd launch a retaliatory strike even when it was no longer in his interest to do so. Similarly, the Soviet KGB leaked fabricated medical reports exaggerating Brezhnev's senility with the same end in mind. Ultimately, the Americans broke this deadly symmetry by using a ‘doomsday device’. They equipped a worldwide fleet of submarines with enough missiles to destroy the USSR, and arranged their communications technology in such a way that the President could not be sure to be able to reach the submarines and cancel their orders to attack if any Soviet missile crossed the radar ‘trigger line’. Of course, this strategy depended on making sure that the Russians were aware of the device.    In 'Dr. Strangelove', the world is destroyed by accident because the Russians build a doomsday machine but then keep it a secret! As a result, when the mad American colonel launches missiles at Russia on his own accord, and the American President tries to convince his Soviet counterpart that the attack was unintended, the Russian President sheepishly tells him about the secret doomsday machine. Now the two Presidents can do nothing but watch in dismay as the world is blown up - due to a game-theoretic mistake.          urlLink              +      Update:         # Kubrick on game theory: "I started out being completely unfamiliar with any of the professional literature in the field of nuclear deterrence. I was at first very impressed with how subtle some of the work was -- at least so it seemed starting out with just a primitive concern for survival and a total lack of any ideas of my own. Gradually I became aware of the almost wholly paradoxical nature of deterrence or as it has been described, the Delicate Balance of Terror. If you are weak, you may invite a first strike. If you are becoming too strong, you may provoke a pre-emptive strike. If you try to maintain the delicate balance, it's almost impossible to do so mainly because secrecy prevents you from knowing what the other side is doing, and vice versa, ad infinitum . . .       ## Peter Sellers played three different roles in the movie: President Merkin Muffley, RAF Group Captain Mandrake, and ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove. Kubrick originally envisioned Sellers playing a fourth role,    as Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens in the film), but his inability to create the right Texan accent and a broken leg necessitated finding another actor.

         After a lot of thinking I've been able to recall the lyrics of our own-comp, "The Last Lap" in the Western Music Group Litsoc 2002-03. Heheh.. it was sooooo funny. It wasn't SUPPOSED to be funny of course. The song, written by sux, I and Arjun was about Jam cheating in Litsoc (Don't laugh.. it was a serious thing back then). So we sat down and made up a tune and came up with the weirdest lyrics that didn't even rhyme. The 'oil' and the 'white crow' (wtf !!) in the song are courtesy Sux and they represent 'betrayal' and 'cheating' respectively. Sux played lead, Arjun played some good bass and i did a metallica voice-over for the chorus :) It was the last event of the Cul - year. We ended up coming 3rd and won Litsoc by 2.3 points over Jam.      And we're almost there  Not tired but stronger  And better then you    And suddenly a white crow  You throw in my way-ay  How could you ?    Why-ay-aaay-ay why why?  Why-ay-aaay-ay ay ay?  Why-ay-aaay-ay ay ay?     Yesterday's gone and tomorrow's here  The moon through the branches is as beautiful  And friend your oil under my feet  Makes me put on my shoes and run-  Harder for the last lap     I say Why-ay-aaay-ay why why?   (streched out and really loud)        [Sux's solo comes here.. it was awesome.. seriously]    Yesterday's gone and tomorrow's here  The moon through the branches is as beautiful  And friend your oil under my feet  Makes me put on my shoes and run-  Harder for the last lap  Harder for the last lap  Harder for the last lap...    +

       I'm not sure if I should write about this at this time but if I don't, It'll get all hazy in my mind. Its about a concept that I'd once discussed with Matak. I'm not sure what its called. I think some Irish philosopher guy first wrote about it. Its something all of us take heavily for granted but all the world 'as we know it' depends on it. No, its not some wieldy physics theorem like relativity or anything. Hell its a lot simpler than physics.                  Let me begin with an example: What you perceive as the colour GREEN may not necessarily be what I perceive as GREEN.  This sentence is written in the colour GREEN.  Yes, we both agree on that of course.. but the colour you perceive in your brain when you see that sentence, may not necessarily be the colour that I perceive. It is quite possible that I perceive the colour that you normally call PURPLE. However I still call it GREEN because that’s what I've been taught to call it since I was a kid. Get it?                    The implications of this concept are quite astounding as I realized when I first understood it. The concept is not limited to colour... it applies to anything that is perceived by us.. to our entire world 'as we know it'. It means that the true cognitive perceptions of different individuals about a single object are actually independent (and may be different) - however the individuals may still consider their perceptions to concur.                    But here's the best part:  There is no way to prove that you are actually perceiving the same colour as I am when you are reading this sentence.. we both call it green, but there's no real way to be sure that you're seeing what I'm seeing!  For that, we would need a third person/machine that can simultaneously 'see' (or in general, 'perceive') what both of us perceive.                  +                         # Ok, if you’ve understood what’s written above, here’s my question: If two people perceive the color green completely differently, but still call it green, then which one of them is right ? :)                   ## 'Any Colour You Like' was part of Pink Floyd's 8th album 'Dark Side of the Moon' released in  1973 . It totally kicks ass! However, have a look at the lyrics of ' urlLink Eclipse ', another track from the same album.. the're totally 'in-tune' with the theme of the above discussion.

       What's the difference between a Bollywood movie and a Hollywood movie ? While Hollywood movies range in subject from schizophrenia to whacky space oddesies, a Bollywood movie is always centered around a love story between two good looking people of the opposite sex ( Girlfriend  doesn't count ok). It now makes perfect sense to me. A movie is intended to provide entertainment by taking the viewer into the realm of the fantastical. Love stories are fantastical to Indian audiences! Since the days of Madhubala and Mumtaz, we've been watching two people fall in love with one another, movie after movie, because we are a race of people who belive in arranged marriages (read as "tying the bullock to the cart". Really, the garlanding and the going-round-in-circles with ends of clothing tied in a knot are symbolic of this) . My guess is that when a white man watches a dubbed or subtitled version of a Bollywood movie, he only appreciates it for the fact that it is ALWAYS a musical with choreographed pelvis shaking dance sequences! All the coochie-cooing and (fake) kissing are nothing new to him... he's already done those things in real life. But young people all over our huge country get turned on by the slightest nuance of lust and educate themselves of what they'd like to do with their partner, if they had one.    +

       The last weekend was spent at a famous Gurudwara near Nairobi.  Yes Gurudwara  ! Built in 1901, the Makindu Gurudwara is known for providing shelter and food to anyone who happens to drop by, irrespective of religion or nationality. The beautiful building, situated 250 kms east of Nairobi city can be spotted miles away by a 40 meter tall flag mast with flag bearing the Khalsa symbol on it. The Gurudwara complex itself is spread over several acres of land that include a farm, 48 cottages for visitors, a museum and a massive dining hall apart from the Gurudwara's main building and the Persian style archway overlooking it.    After a sumptuous breakfast of Aloo Paranthas and Lassi, I cover my head with one of the white bandanas lying in a basket and enter the gurudwara's main hall. In the sanctum sanctorum, a recitation of the Guru Grahanth Sahib is being performed. I am informed that the recital never stops.. it is carried on endlessly through night and day. The hall is beautifully decorated with pictures of the ten gurus and a unique calmness pervades the entire place.     Later we all sat around the Sardarji in charge of the administation and were told stories about the circumstances under which the Gurudwara was built. It was during the days of British rule in Kenya when the historic railway line was being laid between Mombasa and Nairobi. Several Indian men lost their lives in its making. The Sardarji spoke proudly of the glory of the Gurudwara and of the Sikh religion. He left us with some facts about the Golden Sikh Temple at Amritsar:             The Temple's outer crust is made of solid gold.        50, 000 people eat at the temple everyday.        On special occasions, between 150,000 and 200,000 people eat at the temple everyday.        At all times, the temple is stocked with food supplies of three months.    +

      A purple haze is on my mind Escape is of no avail A simple joy I cannot find But my mind is set to sail  So I do what I do best In a white robe she appears My heart is now at rest Seeking succor as she nears  Black flowing hair she has And smiles that melt a stone A million maids can’t match her flair No more am I alone  Slowly she rests her head on mine I can almost feel her glow Slowly now I’m feeling fine All my troubles seem to flow  Within her warm and sweet caress As soft and smooth as butter She straightens up my utter mess And makes my heart go flutter  Where I can hear her laughter Where I can feel no pain Happily ever after Wish I could just remain  But something from the real world Wakes me from my daze And so abruptly I am hurled Back to the purple haze.   +   Jimi Hendrix died in 1970 at the age of 27 of a drug overdose.

      Just watched Requiem for a Dream AGAIN! Never thought i'd watch it again. The sountrack is just brilliant.. and funnily the scene that sticks to me is the one in which Mariann and the guy are in top of a building making paper planes and then they run away after she triggers some sort of an alarm.

      Ahhh.. I'm finally at home and in front of my computer. A hot cup of coffee in my hand and jimi hendrix in my ears. This is the life... finally done with all the boring dinner parties of the weekend. Have also been spending quite a bit of time into tweaking and playing with this blog template.   I've got a job as an intern at this company called ROM Communications International for the remaining month that I'm here. They install cellular base stations for  urlLink vodafone  et al. Not really 'fun-stuff' but it keeps me busy anyway... am going to their tower fabrication workshop tomorrow morning and then to a STM tower installation site not far from the city.

      If you look at it carefully, Natural Selection is a very beautiful thing. Its beauty lies in the fact that it causes constant change. It is a law. Laws are good because they help us to understand things systematically as against abstract concepts and whacky ideas that don't conform to logic. The law of Natural Selection states that under a constraint of limited resources and a growing population, members of the new population are decided based purely on their merit of fitness. In other words, the law says that only the fittest survive. You don't need a whole branch of science to understand that. Natural Selection doesn't require a driving force to be implemented. It just applies itself without any effort while being consistent and without being partial to anybody or any object. It is an absolute law. It is what I call a universal law. Very basic in nature and unchangeable.   There are other such laws. Another one is the law that says that all material things have finite lives. That’s a simple one too. Matak and I have had an interesting conversation on its validity. One only needs to look around oneself to see the absolute validity of the law. Very simple but very unchangeable. One comes to a quick conclusion that everything in the world is material so everything must have a finite life.. everything must end. That’s true. SOME things are not material. Those things, according to our law, will not end.. they will continue to remain forever. But we'll come to a description those infinite things later.

      So the big question is whether we are intelligent creatures made by god himself (or herself) destined to rule over the planet and over all other forms of life on it OR are we the result of a hundred million years of evolution ? Charles Darvin first raised this question in his famous theory of evolution and immediately created a furor in the church at the times. It was an established fact that humans were superior to any other form of life and it was so because the human race had been 'designed' by God in his own image, made specifically to possess the unique powers of thought and the ability to articulate and perform tasks. Nobody was prepared to accept that our race could have evolved from some sad unicellular organism. So are we really the products of natural selection through millions of years?   The reason Darvin's theories shook up the whole of Christianity was not because he had put forward a new theory of which nobody had ever thought of before but because it implicitly questioned the function of God and indeed the existence of God itself. After all if we evolved over the centuries from one organism to the next then what role did God have to play in making us. Surely the story of God 'creating' man on the nth day of creation and the story of Adam and Eve were pooptalk. Today, it is sufficiently well established that Homo Sapiens are indeed the product of a very long and complicated evolution chain that might have gone through creatures resembling chimpanzees, some sort of amphibians and it all probably started as unicellular organisms in the ocean. For some people, the question of whether or not we are the result of evolution is an important factor in deciding the personal viewpoints about the existence or non-existence of god. Therefore, for them the question: "Does God exist?" translates to "Is the theory of evolution wrong?" But does the theory of evolution really preclude the existence of God ? No.    The truth is, it doesn't really matter whether we were 'created' by God in one day or we evolved of millions of years. The time span of creation is immaterial: Either way we were created. Natural Selection and evolution are more consistent with the logic and mathematics that are the tools of our time.

      It is based on conceptual models which have no connection or origin in reality. In other words, the reality that we perceive is based upon rules and ideas that we have designed for ourselves and which do not emanate from true reality.   In 'Simulacra and Simulation', the French postmodernist philosopher Jean Baudrillard explains that such self-evolved models become the determinant of our perception of reality and the real.

      It is a moment of creation. An irreversible clockwork has been set into motion. A spark has been lit. This spark will light up a million different lights. It is the instant that knowledge is imparted to a child’s mind. Its virgin brain accepts everything it is fed. What it hears and what it sees. And so begins the mind its long journey, before it is even aware of its own existence and without even being given a choice.   There comes a time in the lives of some people, when they stop living and start thinking about the things they took for granted. An uneasy feel covers one's consciousness like a shroud. The mind becomes aware that something is wrong with the way it perceives reality. For me, that time is now.  The essence of normalcy is the refusal of reality. The human mind lives in a constant need for happiness. It derives happiness sometimes in the form of love or praise and sometimes from just a simple raw pride at being what one is. It constantly reminds itself of why it is happy, always working to look for new reasons to be happy. Happiness is like a fuel for the mind. When it runs out of reasons to be happy a man becomes visibly sad and can even go into depression – an acute state of absence of happiness. And so the mind creates its own comfortable artificial world in which it needs to be happy. The artificial world is a bubble surrounding his life, blinding him, carrying him farther and farther away from reality. The tender mind that was once blank thus becomes an indoctrinated machine hungry for happiness which it consumes endlessly and ruthlessly. At the very core, it understands only one language: that of happiness, its universal currency. I know what you’re thinking. No… there isn’t any such thing as mercy or kindness. Everything is either happiness or the absence of it. Brilliantly, it calculates its every move planning to maximize potentially available happiness. Call it selfish if you will, but it just wants to live on, and it can’t without its fuel.  Which brings us to the question: What is our final aim? Is it to be happy and content with peace love joy and happiness always, or is it to seek the true nature of reality, or in other words, to seek the truth?   What does one gain by knowing the truth, the absolute nature of reality? Happiness? If it were only for the happiness then why take the pains of looking for the truth? Or perhaps its such a huge amount of happiness that its worth it? Perhaps then it is all about just happiness? We would never know, would we?

      The following is a piece of writing whose meaning and spirit I share with a close friend. The word 'they' has special emphasis.   . . You start a journey knowing you are right. You create relationships knowing that they will last forever. You realize that your journey is achieving its purpose and you reach a state of contentment.  All of a sudden you recognize a change... you are not seeing anyone. The voice has gone.  You realize that it was a shadow and not someone in reality. Then you start thinking "what is reality?" They say “it was a mistake, a sin, a state of illusion that they gave you the false happiness. It was a state of confusion that they thought your company was invaluable, a state of impulsiveness in which they chose to speak with you”. All of a sudden things change. The world around you shrinks from a large sky with unlimited space to a black hole with unlimited darkness. You loose your mental balance as you have failed to differentiate between shadows and humans. You go deep down inside your senses and curse them for betraying you.   You forget to differentiate between dreams and reality, conscious and unconscious, living and non-living and you question the perfection of your senses. You don’t feel cheated by anyone but by your own senses which made you believe that they speak truth, that they were yours forever and that they are “humans”.  Blood replaces the tears in your eyes and water replaces the blood in your veins. It’s the replacement that kills you from inside and you loose the human element in your heart. You start looking at life from a different perspective. The replacement of body fluids help you loose the sense of pain and joy and reach a state of detachment, which Zeno proposed centuries ago. Stoic-ness. You start looking at your emotions as your weaknesses, your cause of pain and want to get rid of them. You stop loving and caring for people and see them as a cause of fear.  Pragmatism is a part of human judgment and governs most of our basic actions but there has to be some room for your emotions, for your human-element that influences the index of kindness in your personality and thoughts. Impulses and dreams are ephemeral..  but their impact and  effect on human actions are eternal. Living life by impressions and constraints make you feel good for a short while until realize that you are not yourself. Being driven by your emotions and having the energy to justify them requires an inner confidence and faith in your self. Follow your inner voice in every.. action guided by that divine flame which keeps burning in your heart and fuels your soul.    Fear of death and darkness goes away. But emotions run deep inside you. You learn to deny them, even though you are aware that these emotions and hormones are what make you human. You are on the verge of loosing your identity as a human. Think!! The element of kindness and life that makes you a human and gives you superiority over other species in this universe… you are on the verge of loosing the very basic thing that has made you so great and helped you achieve so much.   Sit in a lonely place, close your eyes, take deep breaths, feel your heart beating and the blood flowing in your veins. You are about to make a very big decision about your transformation from living to non-living. You are about to die...  +

      ok two things:  1. I was talking to someone at a party last night when they asked me "..so what exactly did you do for your BTech project ?". And I just stood there... couldn't remember a thing of what I'd done. After a good 20 seconds, i said some made up stuff that included the words "wireless", "bit error rate" and "performance". Kick me for this Harry ! It was much much later that the words "channel tracking" hit me.   2. Kournikova is out,  urlLink Sharapova  is in :) Wow she was just amazing in the wimbledon's women's finals.. watched the whole thing twice. This goddess actually wins grand slams.  over n out.

      P A R T - II   The next few weeks brought tons of litsoc points to Mandak and we ended the year with a 120-or-so point win over Alak, the closest competing hostel. (poor Alak!) We had 'fought' our way to yet another consecutive LitSoc win. The next litsec would say in his inaugural speech, "... We have been winning Litsoc for n+1 years ! We've gotta win it for the (n+2)th time!... blah blah" . Oh Boy ! What a blast !  [All this is not to say mine was the only hostel that did shit. I'm sure every hostel did, does and will continue to do truckloads of shit every lit-year. The whole system is flawed. Scrap the  damned litsoc I say. Yeah ! Let people participate for personally glory. Not for the glory of their hostel. 'Aint no such thing as hostel spirit. That's what I say!]  In the middle of all this fighting, we had lost the bigger picture. We didn't know why we were devoting so much time and effort into winning. Perhaps some of my friends realized it earlier than I did (You know who you are. Good for you !) and some never really realized it. It was like waking up from Neo's dream. When I did wake up, it wasn't an abrupt dawning of facts. It was slow and painful. A large fraction of people in my hostel don't even know what litsoc means, leave alone having enthu to participate in it. Oh heck ! What the hell !  In my third year I learnt a great deal about the internal working of Litsoc. Deeper and deeper I went and it consumed me. I've never admitted it to myself but now I think this whole litsoc thing had a huge influence on my academic output. (Heheh.. Who cares ?) During this year I handled major hostel decisions in the lit-scene and also attended some litsec meetings... thanks to my good friend...oops COLLEAGUE, Mr. Bose. Yeah, he was the litsec then and he made i moved my ass a good deal so we could push our hostel to yet another victory. After all, who'd like to loose a Litsoc under his litsec-ship, especially a litsec-ship won through great pains after a four way election  ? hahahah. (I love the colleague thing btw!).  So in April 2003, we did another Mandak Litsoc win. After a huge amount of haggling, flinging of accusations, the details of which i will pass, and court-of-law-style quarreling with rival hostels and the culsecs, all of which hated us by now, we 'engineered' another glorious win, this time beating rivals Jam by 2.5 points. I was to be the next litsec of Mandak. Man, it felt good. Oooohhhh yes it did.   I learnt a great many things in the following year. My finally year at IIT and at Mandak. The most important of these was the realization that everybody in Mandak wanted to win the Litsoc (even though some of these people didn't know what LitSoc really was) but very few people wanted to do anything to contribute towards that desire. I inwardly felt we didn't really deserve to  win if we didn't have the will to. Ten or twelve people in a hostel of 250 just wasn't good enough. And so in April 2004, we broke the chain ! We lost Litsoc to a very deserving Alak. I wonder now if the loss meant anything at all to the bulk of people who live in Mandak. Hmmm.   When I look back now, i see the mistakes we made, the mistakes i made. We were blinded, i was blinded. Litsoc really isn't about winning - and I don't say this because we lost under my litsecship (but then again I wouldn't have had the chance to reflect had we won again) - its about participating and having fun ;)   (Ye hear that gape ? Its about having fun! 'course you don't understand a word of that , do you ?  Heheheh... )    ^Above left: Gapa. Our new litsec (enjoying a lighter moment) All the best to you baby! Others in the pic: PLD, Danny (love you bitch), matak (fighter, whore! Look what I did ..heheh) and Jhantoo.    To all the good times we've shared !  . . . . .  Waiting for your comments on this one.     *Litsoc is the annual interhostel championship for literary and cultural events and competitions. It comprises LITerary and SOCial activities.

      P A R T - I   My romance with the Litsoc began in my very first week of college when I teamed up with Harry  Balls and Megs (At that time he was called Banjar) to play ‘Dumb C’ and ‘Picto’ under the able guardianship of Phani Kiran and 1D. We’d practice for long hours and we were invincible - Best freshie team and finalists in both picto and Dumb C. ‘So this is what life in IIT is all about’, I thought to myself. It was a unique high. Sam was the Litsec then. I held Sam in very high regard. The first thing he told us freshies in the ‘meeting in the mess’ was that Mandak had been winning the LitSoc for n years and we just had to win for the (n+1)th time. And so we began a journey that would take us to dizzy heights. But we had set out on the wrong foot and we didn’t even know it.   Litsoc in my freshie year couldn’t be completed and the trophy (a huge piece of wood with some brass on it) stayed safely in the Mandak common room. The next litsec was Phani Kiran. Phani and 1d always hung out together and most people I knew had immense respect for the duo. So did I.   It came to dawn upon us at some point during this lit-year that we were under threat of losing to Alak [another IIT hostel.. full of strange people :D ]. And then one day a very strange thing  happened. I was in my room with 1D and phani discussing “strat” when Bose burst in with his black fake adidas bag which he immediately opened and shot out a string of questions which he was going to ask the following day in the India Quiz (Bose was an India Quiz co-ordinator). Before I fully realized what we were in the middle of, Bose had revealed a good fraction of his question bank (an act for which Parande, Bose’s co-co-ordinator never really forgave him and for which Mandak became the perennial butt of jokes in Alak).  I don’t think I was majorly upset or shocked by this open act of cheating then because the phani + 1D  duo had had enough ‘faith’ in me to let me know that the ‘threat’ of loosing to Alak would be ‘neutralized’ and it was ‘no problem’ as we had enough event co-ordinators in our hostel to take  care of that. This is not to say that any of my seniors were thugs or rotten heads but I guess we  were all so blinded by the need to win that we’d lost sight of the bigger picture. Sure, I was a little stunned and a little confused but I continued to smile. We were cheating !   Hurrah !    ^ Me making a backdrop for the mandak 2002 fete stall. It was the most fun I had in 4 years.

       Naah.. I'm not in love. I'm just in love with the thought of being in love. What a stupid thing really. No no.. not stupid.. 'how totally peurile and inanely naive'.. there.. thats sounds better. Perceptions: Thats hitting the nail on its head. Don't blame  me , blame my  perceptions , don't blame my perceptions, blame the processes that gave rise to them, ahhh the processes. Don't blame the processes either, because processes are but a slave to ambient circumstance and the trigger of stimulus. Stimulus is determined by a billion other factors (not including destiny... you didn't think i was heading in that direction did you ?) and what can we say about circumstance eh ? I'm rambling.

       With a week left before i leave, I can detect a sudden and definite shift in my parents' focus of conversation. Everytime I so much as  mention  a female's name, I invite a very interested glance from dad and a HUGE smile from ma. Before i can say anything more, the inevitable twist in conversation happens: "so xxx is a nice girl don't you think ?" or, a seemingly innocuous "tell me more about this xxxx.. what's she doing ?". Gimme a break people ! Yeah yeah... I wanna get married too but this is outright ridiculous. Everyone I mention is looked at with the prospect of being my potential bride. I'm running out of time god. Help me. Need to find someone quick. Need a miracle. Waiting.  In other news, I am hopelessly addicted to the this new song I just heard "Allah ke bande"... must've heard it like 50 times today after I  urlLink downloaded  it (did I say 'new song' ??? Heheh). The guitaring gives me a high.. reminiscent of the way the guy who played Deewana for Fubar strummed. The chords just swept me off the ground. The title words "Allah ke bande hasde" make me really happy somehow... lyrics are like a fresh cool wind... makes me forget about all the worries in the world. I'm listening to it right now and fantasizing that I'm singing in the Central Lecture Theatre at iit-m in front of a packed audience. What a high!  +

        I've gotta go away no matter what you say Babe I'm gonna leave you No its not that I am gay  Its just that I've to leave now 'cross oceans and far lands A new life I've to weave now Far from indian sands  Hey don't you fret 'bout me don't you fret at all Fit and fine I will be Winter spring or fall  I'll miss our sweet talks though I'll miss our stupid brawls The dinners and the long walks too, And all the missed calls  And oft in solitude I find When i think of you my friend A stinging sorrow fills my mind With the agony of the end  And then my heart goes flutter With memories that remain In ecstacy pure and utter In wild and free refrain  Like so my heart goes flutter Like mild and mazy motion Like melting snow or butter Like soft and sweet sensation  Like the pleasure and the pain of running up the hills Or Dancing in the rain Like Wordsworth's golden Dafodils  Wish I could forever stay now Until the very end of time I hate to go away now It's the end of my rhyme     I'm never going to leave you babe ;)  +  # Suggested listening: ' urlLink Babe I'm gonna leave you ' - Led Zeppelin

       I ask my dear friend "The 'other' I" for advice. Following an infinitely prolonged awkward situation with a cherished female-friend I have to decide whether or not to contact her and initiate conversation. The 'other' me instructs me that the decision, of course, depends on whether I want to give up on her and abandon any hope of a relationship or not.  Me: Okay, so what if I don't want to give up on her?  The 'other' me: You don't call her.  Me: But you said I don't call if I wanted to give up on her.  The 'other' me: Right.  Me: So I don't call either way?  The 'other' me: Right.  Me: So what's the difference?  The 'other' me: There is no difference right now. See, mate, the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her when SHE comes to you. But you can't do anything to make her want to come to you. In fact, you can only do stuff to make her not want to come to you.  Me: So the only difference is if I forget about her or just pretend to forget about her ?  The 'other' me: Right.  Me: Well that sucks.  The 'other' me: Yeah, it sucks.  Me: So it's like a retroactive decision, then? I mean I could, like, forget about her and then when she comes back, pretend like I just pretended to forget about her ?  The 'other' me: Right. Although probably more likely the opposite.  Me: What do you mean?  The 'other' me: I mean at first you're going to pretend to forget about her, you'll not call her, I don't know, whatever... but then eventually, you really WILL forget about her.  Me (after some thinking) : Well what if she comes back to me first?  The 'other' me: Hmmm... see, that's the thing, :D somehow they know not to come back until you really forget.  Me: That's the thing then.  The 'other' me: That's the thing.  +

       Today was a sad day for electrical engineering. Four years of gruelling work at iit madras and today i failed to correctly use the 'knowledge' that I'd hoped i had 'gained'. I messed up big time. Here's what happened: I, very ambitiously make plans to connect my computer's sound card to the big stereo we have in the living room so that the collection of mp3 music can be put to good use. So I go and spend a fortune buying 35 meters of stereo cable (yes i know the signal levels would fall in such a long wire... vitto ki maa kaa), RCA female plugs and a stereo jack. Most of friday and the better part of saturday is spent in setting up the cable and convincing my dad of the the return on investment. The whole thing is finally ready and whaduyu know.. it works ! So I'm swaying to the tune of 'Nothing else matters' when i think to myself 'Lets push this thing to higher volume level'. I go and hike up the volume of the comp speaker from whose headphone port i have taken the sound output for the stero jack. All is well for a while. Suddenly, Metallica is inturrepted by a PHHssshhh-TackkKKK sound and i see smoke rising from the comp speakers. I am left with no speakers and a burnt sound card. Well done. Bravo ! BRAVO !!!!  I spend the next few hours pissed with myself, slowly realizing the mistake I'd made. I don't even have enthu to write the funda of what went wrong. Kill me please. Today is convocation day. I'm supposed to be officially become an electrical engineer for goDDDSSAke !!!!! EEEeeeaaarrgghhHHHHH !!  +
