       Monday Gaming   It seems like I have competition now. We had some of Charles' meat (venison) and we all liked it. Of course, it was me who breaded it *wink wink*. My character was a bit useless during the game. I pretty much just sat there with Charles' character betting on who would get hurt first, betting that Morgan would drop his rock on his foot and lose HP, just betting... and the one time where I got to swing at an orc I roll a friggen 4... I guess I should have cast true strike instead. Oh well, we all leveled up yesterday, and I'm picking a fighter level over mage. Sure, the group would be better off if I'd choose to be a mage, but that just won't work with my character - he's a fighter that chose to know a bit about magic, but he's not 100% interested in it (just enough to be able to kill a certain other mage.) That, and I get another feat for picking up fighter. I'll definitively get Exotic Weapon Proficiency - Dwarven Waraxe so that I can use it one-handed. The other feat might be Quick Draw, but I'm not 100% sure about that (I'll have to ask Jeff if the holster for the axe I got provides the same functionality as Quick Draw, since he said it would allow my character to draw the axe quicker than normal.) Or maybe I'll pick up Improved Called Shot, but my crit range is bad to start with anyway... or perhaps I'll get up Power Charge. Well, I'll first have to see whether I need Quick Draw or not.

       Friday at work   I forgot to mention several things that happened:  1) I skipped class and went straight to work. That ain't a bad thing though, it's not like I missed anything. 2) I installed Debian Linux on one of the new servers. The problem is that the kernel that Debian comes with does not include support for our network cards, so I have to compile and install a new kernel.  3) The other folks from the SAD project group came over and I gave them a quick n' dirty tutorial about basic system administration 4) Philip Tilton came and went on working on the Cisco router (I hate that thing... we put ~$500 into it, and it doesn't work. For that price, it should make me coffee and fetch donuts). Well, Philip got it kind of working... the DNS tables are still f*cked up.

       Gaming decisions   Well, it looks like I'm joining the Saturday group for a Vampire game. That means I'll have to drop the AD&D game, but I'm getting fed up with D&D anyway... I need a change. I already got the type of character in mind that I want to play... it'll be fun. I finally get to play a character that is not chaotic stupid (well, there's the character for Jeff's game on Mondays too, but that one's not  evul  (yes, ev u l).

       Friday night happenings   After anime club we went to the Lotus Cup. They were having erotic poetry night, and it was a blast. There was so much fun stuff going on, my sides were bursting. After that we dropped by Carol and Amber's and I made milanesas a la napolitana (unfortunately we didn't get the right bread... sure, pan lactal is the easiest to use, but I should have gotten mignoncitos). Oh well, everyone  liked my meat , and Carol got disturbed when I was  stroking my wood  in her kitchen *hehe*.

       Sing a song   Every time I hear  The Fallen One  by  Hammerfall  my eyes get watery. It's not just nice lyrics, it's the whole melody that just brings up a whole bunch of emotions. But it's not just that one. There is a whole bunch of songs that make me feel all giddy and fuzzy inside. There's  Always Will Be ,  Remember Yesterday , and  Glory to the Brave .  There are other great bands as well. Many songs by  Stratovarius  bring out my soft side, including (but not restricted to)  Dream with me ,  The Abyss of Your Eyes ,  Celestial Dream ,  Falling into Fantasy , and  Season of Change . They have a great array of energetic songs too:  Lord of the Wasteland ,  Soul of a Vagabond , and  Magic Carpet Ride , among others. Next is  Blind Guardian . Their array of songs is just as impressive as  Stratovarius ', with the bonus feature of having great epic songs (most based on Tolkien's Middle Earth), which I'm a sucker for (I am not a  Homo Sapiens , a thinking man, I am a  Pan Narrans , a storytelling ape). Let's start with slower songs:  A past and Future Secret ,  The Wizard ,  Lord of the Rings ,  Mies del Dolor ,  Black Chamber , and  The Bard's Song - In the Forest  are just a few. Whenever I need an energizing jolt I like to listen to  Thorn ,  When Sorrow Sang ,  Blood Tears ,  The Quest for Tanelorn ,  Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns) ,  Mirror Mirror ,  The Bard's Song - The Hobbit ,  And then there was Silence .... gee, just about any of their songs.  While on the topic of  Blind Guardian  I have to give  Demons and Wizards  (D&W) a mention of honor. D&W is a co-production between  Blind Guardian  and  Iced Earth . The former brought in their bombastic chorus and fanciful melodies, while the latter brought in raw emotions and strength. The two bands complement each other really well, and D&W is the perfect example. When I get angry there is almost nothing better to calm me down than two of their songs,  My Last Sunrise  and  Heaven Denies . The former is great - it starts slow, almost brooding, and carefully picks up energy bit by bit, word by word... and then there's an explosion of emotions, and all the rage just flows out and trickles away... the song is slow again, and energy builds up, the anger accumulates... a short silence... and then all the bile just flares up and consumes itself, but the song keeps up its tempo, and you take all the anger and hate you got in your head and add it to the song, until at the very last you spent it all, and the song slows down... ah, that was refreshing. I feel much better now.  I mentioned  Iced Earth  (IE), and it fits in perfectly after D&W because theirs are great anger management songs as well.  Damien  is specially good, because it not only has the tempo changes from D&W's  My Last Sunrise , it also tells quite an interesting story. If by now I'm not calmed down then  The Phantom Opera Ghost  will... the whole song is set as a dialog between Eric and Christine (from the play), and the whole story unfolds as they sing... beautiful. Like  Blind Guardian , IE does a lot of epic songs, but with a different setting. Whereas  Blind Guardian  likes fantasy themes, IE prefers settings about human nature, sorrow, roots of evil...  The Suffering - A Question of Heaven  is just lovely... it's based on the Spawn comic book, and it basically tells the end of the story as if Spawn was telling it. Very emotional.  Let me wrap up this rant with  Iron Maiden . There is not much I can say about them that hasn't been told already. I got their new CD less than a week ago,  Dance of Death , and it really surprised me. When  Brave New World  came out it was a big change compared to their older records, a lot slower, a lot more melodic. I liked it, but classicists weren't happy.  Dance of Death  pretty much bridges the gap between old and new, and the results are just awesome. The variety of riffs and melodies in this record span all of  Iron Maiden 's history, as well as other bands'.

       Braiiins....   I can't believe how burned out I was today... yesterday... err... 7 hour ago (how's that?). After leaving work (we now got  all 12  of our servers in there, and the printer came in too; we're still missing the switch, and we're probably need to get 3 dedicated power lines), so we can't use all of the servers yet. And they're wickedly noisy to boot) I went to S&T to meet with the other 2 people in my Systems Analysis and Design (SAD) project group. I basically explained the project to them, gave them a little homework ("get on the internet and learn the basics of how rsync works") and we agreed to meet at the lab tomorrow... today... on Friday after SAD and I'll teach them the basics of package management with Debian Linux (which is a breeze,  apt-get  is so cool). But I digress. After the group meeting I went home, did a little detour to Carol and Amber's to pick up what was left of my ice cream (I was surprised that there was any left at all), got home, dropped my backpack, forgot to put the ice cream in the freezer, and crashed the bed. Almost 7 hours later I wake up to find out that Richard and the others were here and finished their Exalted characters. Apparently they let me sleep because Morgan didn't want to mess with my sleeping pattern (see, he can be nice sometimes - although I think that they wouldn't have managed to wake me up even if they wanted to). So what is the lesson of the day? Well, for once it's not good to only get 3 hours of sleep within the last 48 hours.

       But, but...   Lately I seem to start every second sentence with a  but . Hmmm, I guess it's because I tend to want to look at both sides of an issue, and because I have the bad habit of wanting to defend each side as well.

       Gaming   Last night's game was ok. I mean, I had a lot of fun towards the middle/end of the game, when I pretty much saved the party (one of my magic missiles got extended duration, so we ended up tossing it around at the group of skeletons that was attacking us), then almost got them killed (my detect magic spell exploded), then saved them again twice (ended up using oils to set the party's weapons on fire to kill a gelatinous cube, and then made a successful knowledge check to realize that a wererat can only be hurt by silver and magical weapons [ I  knew that, but  my character  didn't]). They also turned me into the party's guinea pig, and made me test potions and powders, so now my tongue is magical, I tasted a potion of invisibility and a powder that we don't know what it is (but I got a pretty good idea >:] ) and we don't know what effect it caused (can't be worse than the effect of my character snorting the stuff though - yes, he  snorted  some unknown powder) so it'd be interesting to find out what it is.  Now to the bad stuff: I don't think this person realizes it, but some comments made by a-certain-person-who-I-don't-want-to-name-but-we-all-know-who-it-is would be considered offensive by certain friends of mine. I personally don't mind because I know them not to be true, and I believe them to be said in jest, but I know that other people don't have nearly as much patience as I have, and even mine was drawing thin there... but then again, I'd rather forget and forgive than hold a grudge for something silly. The game has also been drawing out for too long. I think that soon I won't be willing to play anymore because it's too much of a tax on my health and my sanity [random CoC reference] roll for sanity... botches! [/random CoC reference] and I'd like to spend my time on other things apart from gaming, like my friends and my projects.

       Shinies!   Weee... today at work a part of our orders came in. Four spanking-new Dell rackmount servers with 2.something Ghz Pentium IV Xeon processors, gigabytes of RAM, hot-swappable drives, gigabit Ethernet, and shiny LEDs.  We also got 2 UPSs, which can handle 3000 W each, but we're worried that the power grid on the building may not be able to handle them (which is also going to be a problem for the servers, because each server has at least a 500 W power supply) so we need to get someone from physical plant over to survey the power grid and give it an a-ok before we do anything.  Not everything is rosy color either... the machines come with RedHat Linux installed, which I don't like, so I'm going to have to install Debian Linux on them... and we were intending on adding serial ATA drives to expand the storage capacity of the servers, but there are no power connectors for those on the servers... maybe external sATA drives?

       Mending misconceptions    Disclaimer: please don't take this personally . Some people seem to think that I am a really nice person. I just want them to know that I'm not. Sure, I  try  to be nice, and I haven't done many un-nice things lately, but I'd like for everyone to know that that's only one side of me. The other side (which I hope none of my friends will ever see) has done really bad things in the past, and this is just one of my ways for making up for it.  There are other reasons for me to make an effort to be nice, which I won't disclose right now, though they are more important than my need to make up for old wrongs. Maybe one day I'll tell y'all about it.  So what's my point, you ask... my point is, o faithful reader, that those who know me should be wary that there is a bad side to me, and I wouldn't want them to put too much trust in me and then get deceived by my other self. That would hurt their feelings, and I couldn't live with myself if I ended up hurting my friends for trying to be a better person.

       A clarification of a previous post   At some point I rambled on about how we were all pissed off about having to move stuff that ain't ours. I was going through the archives and happened upon that rant, and it just seemed to me that it may have sounded that I'm angry at Abhi... but I'm not. He's just doing his job. It's f*cking  Steidly  who's the goddamn bastage, cheapass windbag, leaflicking, mandolin strumming, tree humper.

       1 4m t3h 1337 h4XX0|2   Nah, not really. But now that the old cluster is on a router I can work on it remotely, and work on configurations as I see fit. Now, if I could only figure out why the hell my kernel image is too large even after compressing it... I'll have to take a look at the syntax and see if there's something missing (and knowing the tricks that The Lady likes to play on me, it's probably something very silly and irrelevant.)

       I've been thinking...   No, seriously, I *have* been thinking. I know that I complain a lot about how horribly stupid that English Literature class is, but I like to look at both sides of an issue. And it is there that I remembered one of my favorite books, "The Science of Discworld", by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart, and Jack Cohen. One of the early arguments that the books makes is that we live in a society of lies. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly causes confusion from time to time. The authors call that practice "lies to children". If you look at how we teach things then you'd notice that we start out with outright lies: for example, in mechanical physics we first teach Newton's laws, even though we know that they're only a rough approximation. But they are easy to teach, easy to learn, and once you understand them then you can more easily understand quantum mechanics. In other words, Newton's laws are lies to children.  So maybe this English Literature class is just another lie to children, and I'm just pissed off because I know that it's a lie. Mind, knowing this won't prevent me from bitching about the class for the rest of the semester - I still think that it's a complete waste of time for me.

       Just to set things clear   I'm a bastard. A stubborn bastard, and I don't see the forest for the tree. I get easily pissed at people who criticize me, and I don't apologize enough. In retrospection I did a lot of selfish things this last week, and I'm sure I bothered at least a few of my friends. If you're reading this and feel that you're one of those, then please accept my sincere apologies. I've talked to someone else about this, and I admit that I'm a blind asshole as far as other's feelings are concerned. If I am behaving like an asshat then please tell me so straight one. I'll be likely to throw a fit, but I harbor no ill feelings and once I get time to think things over (which is usually that same night when I'm alone) I will realize what an asshat I've been. So don't be afraid to hurt my feelings... I'd get more offended if there is something wrong with me and no one tells me, because I  need  people to tell me that kind of stuff.

       More English Lit. Hate    "They shouldn't have censored the play because it is supposed to be the age of enlightenment, and that means that they're supposed to accept new ideas" . F*CKING BITCH, IT WAS US WHO CALLED THAT ERA THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT. There was no moment where everyone suddenly looked at the calendar and said "Diddely-doo, today is the first day of the age of enlightenment, let's all go put flower circlets on our heads and listen to new ideas". I should rip out your spleen with a spork dunked in ammonia and jam it up your nose for even thinking of such a retarded thing. And you, stupid bitch, we know what you mean, so DON'T F*CKING REPEAT IT FIFTY TIMES IN A ROW AND ASK IF WE KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. Just shut the f*ck up and think for a second like an adult.

       This is not my shit   I went to work today and Evan told me a story that has me very upset. It turns out that Abhi wants the CSClub to clean out the Beowulf Cluster lab because he thinks that having the club sponsor the project is equivalent to releasing all responsibility from CAMS. But it's f*cking NOT! The machines all have goddamn CAMS property tags, and it was made perfectly clear to us that we were borrowing the machines. So excuse me if I'm pissed off when a f*cking CAMS cheap bastage thinks that their money is not good enough to pay someone to move their own shit, which they would have had to pay anyway. We cannot pay for it with our own money, because  that is f*cking illegal  because the money is strictly for the research, not for getting rid of someone else's trash. And we're NOT going to get students to help because if someone gets hurt then we get all the shit. But we're not going to give in that easily. Oh no. If he wants us to move all that f*cking shit fine, we'll move it...  back to where it came from .

       *You*   You who treat others like you're doing them a favor. You who mingle among my friends sowing the seeds of dissent. Yes, YOU. You better watch out pal, because not everyone has the patience I do. And my own patience is running low, and when it drains away then you get to face Him, and He is not someone you would like to meet. Heck, not even I would like for Him to see the daylight ever again. You are threading dangerous ground here, demanding favors in exchange for nothing. Good people don't demand favors, ever. They give them out, and they get them when needed. Favors are no currency. So you better think about what you're doing.

       On Wednesdays   Well, I talked with Morgan about the AD&D game/Lotus Cup conflict, and we got to a sort of compromise: I'll be playing every second Wednesday. That way he'll know when I'll be playing, and I'll still get to be with me friends often enough. Well, at least things worked out. I'll have to say a prayer to The Lady for fixing that one.

       Rain   I liked yesterday. It rained a lot, but not too much. Reminded me of the summer showers back at home. There is nothing nicer than taking a rowing boat out through the Parana delta on a rainy summer day: It keeps you cool, you don't have to worry about getting sunburnt, and there are less assholes in powerboats out there, which translates into less waves, which makes me a happy, happy Panda. But then again I haven't touched a rowing boat for ages... not as if there are any here in Corpus.

       Cluster news   Well, it seems like things are turning out better for the cluster. We won't have to go through the hub anymore to purchase equipment, because they f*cked up on their responsibilities twice in a row, giving us a price without even checking if they could actually get the hardware. So now we're speccing out the workstations, we're going to purchase the parts from Axiontech because out of all the crap out there on the internet they're the least likely to earf*ck us with the orders.  Charles started working for Scott on Wednesday, so we'll be stealing him for lackey work. And Philip Tilton e-mailed Evan saying that he wanted to volunteer and work at the cluster, so if he turns out to be a decent worker I might train him to take up my job after I leave.

       I f**king told him   So, Morgan was all pissed off yesterday because I went to the Lotus Cup last night instead of playing in his little AD&D game. Even though I told him the first time that Wednesdays wasn't a good idea because if the pack goes to the Cup then so am I. I gave him fair warning, and I regret nothing... it was a very entertaining night yesterday at the Cup.

       Good News   It seems that things within the pack are working out. There are considerably less conflicts than there were last time. That makes me a happy, happy panda! Now I only need to work on getting enough sleep to not fall over.  I also bought some nice posters today. The overall selection wasn't all that good compared to previous semesters, but there were some nice things in there.

       Gaming news   Yesterday we finalized most of our characters for Jeff's game. He got each of us some fancy magic items (I got a  necklace of fireballs  - my dwarven fighter/mage is going to have  so  much fun! :] ) and I wrote him a 5-page background for my character - aye, I was on a writing spree. And I found some nifty spells that have no somatic components and are thus not subject to arcane spell failure due to wearing armor. I still need to look up on the cantrips though... I'll probably wear armor until I get a chance to get my 4th character level, and then pick up  Mage Armor  (the 3rd character level will most likely Fighter, so that I can pick up an extra feat) and drop the physical armor, which will also get rid of the check penalty. One thing I'm wondering though is whether I should change the greatsword for a one-handed weapon and get a shield instead. I could swap DEX with WIS on my character and get that extra will saving throw. Worst case I'll do the kamikaze attack and run to the front lines and drop the necklace at me feet... "BANZAI!!!!"

       Sweet melodies    urlLink Tracy  got me a CD of  Blackmore's Night . So many memories... most of them happy. Things are starting to turn for the better here. I only dread the phonecall from... a certain person. I admit, I still don't get along with my family. Sure, I still love them - they  are  my family after all - but I know that when I talk to them I will lash out again at the worst moment. I completely lost all patience with them, which is why I don't want to talk to them. At the moment, no communication is the best communication.

       And I thought that I had it bad...   Sure, what went on just a week ago was the emotional low for me this semester (it actually being the first time that I had to go out and ask for help) but it doesn't nearly match up to what has been happening to the group this last week. The worst thing of it is that I know that there is nothing I can do to help, but there is nothing I would want to do more than that. It's like having to stand by the road and watch your house burn down. I know that time will fix everything, but I only wish that this will happen soon enough for us to spend a happy last semester together. I want to leave with happy memories, thoughts I can hold on to when I feel down. Maybe it's just a romantic idea, but that's somethign that the world is missing lately. What happened to all those stories of heroes? Why did they get replaced with  E! ,  Fox News , and all that other scum? When has the world become so selfish? Bah, I don't want to talk about sad stuff anymore.

       Eh...   It's Monday again, and it sucks just like every single other fricken' Monday so far. My schedule is not the best either... for the past two weeks I've been getting up 3-4 hours earlier than I normally would, and been getting to bed much later. Probably the only thing that keeps me sane so far is that I take regular naps, but I need a good sleep schedule or I'll burn out.    School and friends   I finally got the official admission from  urlLink Waterloo , which means that I can now go ahead and apply for the visa. On one hand I'm very happy, because I'll be going to a really neat school, probably the best in Canada on the field. But every single day that passes I realize that this also means that I'll have to leave all my friends behind. I did that once, when I came to the States, and it sucks... I'm not the kind of person that makes friends very fast, and it pains me to leave these people... I owe some of them a great deal, and to me they've become quite a family to me. The worst thing is that there is nothing I can do that would allow me to stay, apart from marrying someone.

       Dammit...   I forgot to mention... last Friday was the first CSClub meeting, and Simon quite ruined it... he  forgot to order pizza , and he has absolutely no willpower to manage the crowd. Sure, I didn't plan the meetings myself when I was president, and Simon is only VP, but at least there was stuff going on when I was there. And we  ALWAYS  had pizza.

       Hug me!   Yesterday was  urlLink Programmer's day.     This last week...   ...seems to have been horrible for the group. It started bad enough for me, but at least The Lady smiled on me and things got better towards the end. For some of my friends though it seems to have gone down the drain. And there's been certain people who haven't helped the situation at all... and considering what they've done and who they've done it to, I could wish no less than having the flies of a thousand camels infest their erogenous zones. And that would only be the beginning, for if there is  anything  in common between me and my other self then that is that we're both very loyal to friends (mind, it's for different reasons, but we're both loyal nevertheless). Those guys better watch out...   Gaming   I can't believe how much I forgot about AD&D... oh wellses, most of it will come back with practice.

       I hate it   That English literature class pisses me off. First of all, the professor can't spell every third word. Alchemist is NOT spelled alchlimiast! And then he rambles off all this crap about Greek theater being a cleansing experience, and that the masks they wore were to symbolize the actor hiding his true self... BULL-SHIT! Greek theater was performed at festivals to the goddess of wine, revelry, and art... they went to those festivals for a wee picnic, get drunk, find someone to go back home with and f*ck, and maybe watch what's going on on stage. And the f*cking masks were not worn to hide the actor, they were worn because you can't see an expression from half a f*cking mile away, which is where most people were (think of it as an ancient Woodstock).

       Index   I was mirroring the Debian ftp server over the weekend. When I came in on monday, all I had downloaded was 3 GB of index files. Oh joy... NOT!   Space   Well, I finally got to mirroring the  real  debian package files, but the machine ran out of space. Fun stuff happens when a linux box runs out of space.   Blinky!   Yesterday we had fun in the lab by making the keyboard lights blink randomly and making the machines crash.

       Gaming   So... there seem to be some discrepancies between my friends at the gaming group... there's those who don't mind the Monday meetings being a social event, and there's those who are a wee bit upset because they think they're wasting their time. There's the ones who absolutely hate 3rd edition D&D and would much rather play something else, and then there's the ones who want to play D&D because they've been playing too many White Wolf games lately. I personally don't have a problem with either, but maybe that's because I'm not a harcore gamer. It's fun, but that's about it. I guess that with a bit of time everything'll work out just fine.    Underworld   I was watching the Daily Show last night, and they showed some new clips from the movie... they absolutely turned me down. Ultra-f**ing-violet light charged bullets? That's just idiotic! If you're going to use ultra-violet lights to kill a vampire then just open a damn tannign salon!

       That is MY bacon!   Well, I was over at Carol & Amber's for dinner tonight... And at some point I was lying on the couch, using Carol as a pillow, and she poked me in the thigh, so I said "That's my ham", and then she poked me in the ribs, so I said "That's MY bacon", and Amber's head almost exploded, and she just splurted out "Not while I've got my back turned to you!". Then Carol poked me in the ribs again, and I squealed "That's my pork chops!", and we ended up rolling on the floor laughing for about five minutes, with phrases such as (from Amber) "And I ATE his pork chops!"... They made me leave the apartment before Amber got turned into a vegetarian.

The machines won't recognize their network cards, or they will recognize them but not start them on bootup, or they'll start them on bootup and they won't work... And then it turns out that the switch wants an IP address... And it even gets offered one by the dhcp server, but nooo, it won't grab that one, it'll just go on sending out dhcprequests.

       Fear me!   For I've been put in the same group as  Trogdor, The Burninator .    You are Form 5,  Dragon : The Weaver.   "And The Dragon seperated the virtuous from the sinful.  He tore his eyes from his sockets and used them to peer into the souls of those on trial to make a judgement.  He knew that with endless knowledge came endless responsibility."    Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena (Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya (Indian).  The Dragon is associated with the concept of intelligence, the number 5, and the element of wood. His sign is the crescent moon.  As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and wise individual.  You weigh options by looking at how logical they are and you know that while there may not always be a right or wrong choice, there is always a logical one.  People may say you are too indecisive, but it's only because you want to do what's right.  Dragons are the best friends to have because they're willing to learn.   urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?

       A productive uneventful week   Yes, we've been very productive at work this week. We probably got more done since Monday than in the two months before that. The only catch is that we did that during the first half of the week, and now we're sleeping on the laurels. As my history teacher from high school used to say, "Hazte la fama y echate a dormir".

       The cold strikes back   This week has been a full-out war between me and my cold. I usually win during the day, but as it gets late the sinuses perform their secret ninja sabotage techniques, and when I sleep the sore throat decides to creep up on me. I need to make some more soup...

       "And here we see a geek in his natural environment..."   Yesterday Charles, Richard, Evan and me hauled some partitions from the warehouse into the lab and put them up. They have Plexiglas windows and look really neat, and now the room is very silent since we put all the servers behind the partition. We can finally talk to each other without yelling.  Today we spent most of the time setting up the machine names and installing Debian clusterwise... We still have problems with mosmon not seeing anything... And some of the machines don't have all the necessary libraries, so some binaries are broken. I'm going to have to reinstall Debian on those.  In the meantime, Philip finally got the Cisco router working, so the Netgear one is unused now. We might bring it out again when we get the laptop so that we can use the wireless hub.  Finally we had some fun with the partitions... Whenever one of us would go in to work on the computers (that would mainly be me or Evan) the rest would go and say "And here we see a geek in his natural environment. Oh, he seems to be upset about something! And remember children, don't feed the animals".

       Sickly sick   I still got a slight cold, but I can live with it. The worst part is in the mornings when I wake up and my throat is all sore because my nose gets clogged up when I sleep, but a hot milk with honey fixes that.

       Slow days, good movies   I got up late in the morning, and found out that I had a terribly sore throat. Apparently the cold had been productive that night. I decided to destroy it's work with a nice hot cup of milk with honey... That last chug of liquid honey really put the energy back into me, and my throat has felt smooth like silk since then.  Just like Saturday, I spent all morning chatting online with friends (yes, Amber was among them too.) There was a link to this one site on Ars Technica about this group that put 11-13 year olds to play Atari games (such as Tetris and Pong) and the comments they made made me feel really old. I had a meeting with the project group for English Literature at 2, so I headed over to the library. We (they) decided to work on Mary Wollstonecraft for the project. I don't really care, as long as I get that done. On the way back I stopped at Amber and Carol's place to get some company, because I didn't feel like sitting alone at home. Chesney was there too, and they were watching  Spinal Tap , but decided to watch something else as I got there. We first watched  High Spirits , which was fun and reminded me of this other movie, whatchamacallit...  Haunted Honeymoon ? Anyway, after that one Chesney left and we watched  Boondock Saints , which absolutely rocked. I loved the cat splat scene, it was fucking hilarious. By the time we finished that one it was almost 7 pm, and Carol hadn't arrived yet, so we started getting a wee bit worried. She arrived 1/2 hour later (we were watching  Brotherhood of the Wolf  by then) and it turns out that she had just left home late. Well, that was one less thing to worry about. Anyway, Amber and Carol went over to Rebecca's to practice, and I went home and made myself some good soup to knock out the cold. You know it's good soup when your sinuses dissolve like butter in a hot pan while eating that soup.

       Saturday...   ...Went pretty slowly. I woke up a bit sore and knew that I had a cold... But I was fine for the day. I spent the whole morning and a great part of the afternoon talking to friends online (mostly Amber.) At 4 pm I had a meeting with the SAD group, and I got them the news that the new cluster is underway, and gave them instructions for scripts they have to write to automate certain processes on the cluster. But before that, on the way there, I stopped over at Amber's to drop off the pumpkin ice cream for later that night, and found out that Tracy was sick, so we weren't going to meet that night. I hope she's alright, I haven't seen her online since Friday. She's probably staying in bed and getting taken care of by Jeff. About 1/2 hour after I got back Morgan appeared. He had gone to Houston just as I had thought, but he was actually planning to run a game that night (which I didn't think would happen). Anyway, I took alight nap (couldn't sleep well with the cold, but at least I could recover from the fever that was assailing me), and then Morgan bursts into my room and says that Amber and Rebecca were at the door. Apparently they had gone to Pancho's and brought me sopapillas, which I thought was very nice and considerate of them. Anyway, apparently the rest of the gaming group had launched a stealth ninja assault on the apartment and were gathered in the living room already, so we started the game. Honestly, it was a boring game that night... A dungeon crawl with fight after fight, and Morgan was bitching a lot about Jeff's game. At one point we got into a discussion about calculating die rolls on percentiles and I got really pissed off because they fucking kept interrupting me... I almost snapped there. I went straight to bed after the game, but couldn't sleep for a good while, so I started thinking about a lot of stuff and got really depressed and cried myself to sleep. But that's ok, a good night's sleep helped me out a lot, and I feel a lot better now.

       Anime and Dinner   I don't remember what we watched at Anime Club, except that it wasn't very entertaining... Or maybe it was just me being pissed at the MFAT thing which I had walked out of just 15 minutes before. In any case, I wasn't paying much attention. At one point Richard asked me to help him with his laptop. He wanted to use his USB ethernet card but forgot how to load the modules, so I tried messing around with it a bit. I think I forgot one step, but the basic setup was done. Charles took me to HEB an hour before the club meeting finished so that I could get stuff to make dinner... I made shepherd's pie. It came out pretty well, except that I miscalculated the portions and made too little... Well, with what we had there was no way that I could have filled those two casserole dishes... In the end it was just enough though, because we also made garlic brushetta for appetizer, so they filled themselves up with bread beforehand. I also think that the mashed potatoes were too salty.

None of the skills that come in useful to a computer scientist are included, and pretty much every skill that you will never ever use again unless you're some crazy mathematician (and a computer scientist ain't no crazy mathematician) is evaluated. Someone give me back those two hours of my life!

       Good news, it's a suppository!   Except that it isn't. A suppository. But it's good news anyway, because we  finally  managed to get custom kernels to work on the cluster. And my prediction was right, it was one f*cking itty-bitty line that was missing. The trick was that it wasn't a default option in the kernel, so we  had to add it manually . On the bright side, we now learned  a lot  on proper kernel compilation and installation. In a sense, this two-week setback increased the knowledge gap between us and conventional CS students here.  After work, Carol and Amber invited me to Bubba's Icehouse. They have really good pork ribs there... The meat just peels off the bone. And free ice cream is always a bonus.  Lastly, we played Exalted last night. I was exhausted, so I was pushing for an early start/end, but Pat was late, so we didn't start until about 10pm. We did end at around midnight though, so that was ok. I didn't get to do much as far as action is concerned... Most of my time was spent sneaking around and... Umm... Sneaking around.

       Some catching up to do   Well, Tuesday was fun. We watched more  Full Metal panic ... We got as far as episode 10. I also kept watching  Airmaster . Episode 8 is a jewel, I'll have to inflict that upon the Anime Club. Of course there will be those people that don't like action, drama, comedy, or whatever else we bring, that will complain a lot about how it sucks. But oh well, I'm not going to worry about that anymore. If they don't like it, then they can go play hide and seek and go f*ck themselves for half an hour. But let's go back to happy stuff. Tuesday night I made  empanadas  for Amber and Rebecca... They were ok, but not as good as they should have been. There were several key ingredients missing. Don't get me wrong, they were still good, but not as good as they should have been. Oh well, at least I know that I can still make them, and now that I have better dough rolling techniques I can churn them out faster... I might even make some for Monday.  Wednesday... Got to work before noon (and no, I wasn't sick - I just got up early)... Then I spent some time working on that friggen' machine... I think I'm getting close to the solution. Taekwon-do at 4:30, then back to the lab for a meeting with the SAD group. We still have that problem of needing to rsync as root... We decided to cheat though and allow root ssh without password on a few machines. Not a good idea, but oh well, can't do much else if we're going to stick with rsync. So what we need to do now is write up a lot of documentation and a lot of scripts to automate tit and tat. Oh, and the gigabit switch came in... Weee! We've also ordered a laptop, because wee "need" a mobile platform.  After that I went to B&J's with Evan, Brooke, and Shelley... We were there for a few hours and had a couple of beers. Brooke and Shelley had this beer called "Liberty Ale", which I swear tastes fruity.  I got to the Lotus Cup around 10pm, and found out that I had missed Tracy's poetry...  Sooooorry!!!  We found out that there's going to be an Erotic Poetry Night not this Friday, but the one after.  Finally we went to Tracy's for a while... I was really tired, and almost fell asleep on the floor there. Of course, almost, because as soon as I settled down someone would go and poke, fondle, or otherwise manhandle me. Jeff had made a chocolate mint cheesecake, and it was still oven warm... Deee-lee-choos!!!

       Quizzy   Well,  urlLink the Jung Typology Test  is not as fun as the ones Tracy posts on her blog, but it definitively is insightful. I didn't feel that the post-analysis by  urlLink Keirsey  matched my personality a lot (there were bits and pieces that I could relate though,) but the analysis by  urlLink Butt  nailed it. The best thing about the Butt link however is that at the end it also gives neat information, such as famous people of your type (but  why  did I have to be of the same type as Descartes?! Well, at least Henry Mancini is someone I don't mind, and it was funny that I got to be of the same type as Jung - the one who created this test,) and suggested relationships for your type.

       Random shtuff   Ok, in Airmaster it seems like the bouncy-bouncy chick has the hots for the fighting chick. I'll definitively have to watch more of that, if just for bouncy-bouncy's sake.  More Nyquil madness: We did the math, and a $3000/week Nyquil addiction it a lot of bottles... Hence comments like "Bottles! I see bottles everywhere" "Yeah, because the floor is littered with them!," and "Nyquil kegstand," and "Nyquil bong," and "Nyquil vaporizer." Yes, we are _that_ bored.

       The good, the bad, and the fugly   Ok, so I started downloading random stuff off Animesuki (see previous post,) and some of the shit they have is really cool! I got hooked on  Airmaster  - It's basically about this voluptuous high school chick that fights by spinning around in the air a lot (hence the name Airmaster,) and then there's this other chick with bouncy-bouncy, and then the first chick fights this Mexican Lucha Libre wrestler... The stuff is just so random that it's cool!  I also got an episode of  Hunter x Hunter , which picks up pretty close to where I stopped reading the manga, so that's cool too. And, and, and.... They have  Space Adventure Cobra !!! YES!!! *Happy Panda dance* So, I didn't get to play AD&D tonight because Morgan decided to tell everyone else but me that there wasn't going to be a game tonight. Sure, I knew that he was going home over the weekend, but I figured that he was leaving after the game and coming back on Sunday night or Monday. This thing with the game just ain't working, and I'm considering just not playing in it at all anymore.

       Another week goes by   So, it was Friday again... I got up unusually early, which means that I'm stressed out again. The good thing is that I got to say good-bye to Carol and Amber (well, just Amber, but at least I could leave a message for Carol) before they left for the weekend. I went to work about quarter after ten, and we spent some more time trying to get the Dell servers to boot with custom kernels. This morning I got a hint at something that may have been wrong with the kernel image, so we're going to take a look at that. Frank from the SAD project came over, and we worked a bit on the rsync server that is basically the core for the user account system... Getting that to work is about 95% of the work we need to do, everything else is just beautification (and yes, that word exists.)  There was a CSClub meeting at 1 - with pizza! Evan (my boss) gave a presentation about HPCDC (the name of our organization that maintains the new cluster. It stands for High Performance Computing Development Center) and all the fancies about it. He  did  make some small mistakes though - I'll have to chide him for that on Monday. He forgot to emphasize that openMosix is only intended as a load-balancing platform, not a straight clustering system, and he didn't mention Grid Computing as the fourth supercomputing platform.  After CSClub some of us went to best Buy and I picked up two more  Full Metal Panic  DVDs. When we got back it started raining and pouring and flooding. This kept on until about 5-ish, and then it stopped as suddenly as it started.  The Anime Club meeting started at 6, and we spent most of the time until then watching Robotech... Then, when we were about to start the Anime Club meeting the projector in the room we were in crapped out, and we spent an hour between trying to fix it and migrating between rooms (the other room had a working projector, but the computer didn't have DVD playing software.) Once we got it all working we started by watching the first two episodes of  Full Metal Panic . After an hour of watching that most people seemed to get bored by it, so we decided to watch something else. After five minutes of "What do y'all want to watch?" "Uhh... I don't know..." I got tired and set an ultimatum - either they decide on something within a minute or we would watch  Kodocha . Boy, did they jump! After 5 seconds we were watching  City Hunter  which brought up mixed feelings with the crowd at the club. There were those who really liked it (with me among them,) and those who really hated it. Once it was done, we watched two episodes of  Naruto , and then we were out of time. A considerably large group went to watch  Kill Bill . They seemed to have liked it and are all hyped up about it. I personally don't really feel like watching it - for some reason I got the impression that it's Charlie's Angels-esque. Anyhow, those of us who didn't got watch that movie got together at Tracy and Jeff's. Jeff made stir-fry, and we watched Kite and Mezzoforte. I had already seen Kite, and had liked it a lot (it's got loads of gore, and a really wicked story,) but I hadn't seen Mezzoforte yet. It absolutely kicked major ass!  Also, Richard got a picture of the 2 gallons of bacon for $4 sign...

       Up up down down left right left right   I've been feeling a bit down lately. I guess it's just now that I've begun to realize how little time I got left here with my friends, and how fast that time is running away. In a way I wish I could be like  Death  in Terry Pratchett's novel, "Reaper Man": In that story Death is about to be retired by the Auditors, which are entities that despise individuality... The basic rundown is that at one point Death finds the hourglass with his own name, and when asked what he was going to do with it, Death responded "I'M GOING TO SPEND IT." I wish that I could do the same, being able to spend time without having to worry about the consequences... But I'm stuck being myself, always worrying about consequences, always wondering if I could have done things differently... And then there are those happy times like last week when I forget about everything that's wrong and just wish that time would just stop on that one happy moment. And I've had a great deal of happy moments since I got back from Canada... Probably more than I've ever had before. *sigh* I'm going to miss this place.

       More computing hell   Ok, I  f*cking hate  those Dell powerEdge 2650 servers!!! We've now spent over a week trying to get a custom kernel to boot one of these whiny beasts, and every time we get the same f*cking error - VFS blah blah cannot mount root. The root partition that is pointed to  is  the right one (/dev/sda3, aka 803, aka 08:03). The drivers for the RAID card also seem to work... So what the f*ck is wrong? And apparently everyone else using these machines has the same problem... Today (I mean, yesterday) I even tried with the latest beta of the 2.6 kernel, which supposedly includes all the fancy drivers needed, but it crapped out too (I  did  get a different error upon kernel panic, but that's probably because I enabled kernel debugging.) I asked around the openMosix listserv, but noone could help there either. My last chances are with the Dell listserv and the software that came with the servers... Given, most of it is for RedHat Linux, but maybe, just maybe, they have the proper patches. All I need is a bootable kernel with the openMosix and Migshm patches applied... Is that too much to ask for?

       Of Bacon and Nyquil   At the Circle K near the university there's a sign that says  Gallon Milk 2/$5 Bacon 2/$4  The first thing that pops into my mind is "Two gallons of bacon for four bucks?!" Then it hits me... "Two gallons of bacon?!"  So I was driving with Charles to pick up Tracy and Jeff to go get dinner, and somehow we got to the phrase "Pot is a designer drug. Try the heavy stuff - Nyquil." Which of course led to "Stoners on Nyquil," which then lead us to "Hey, I consume 4 bags of pot a week man. What do you do? - I take 50 lines of coke a week, dude. What about you? - I spend $3000 a week on Nyquil - Wow, that guy's hardcore..."

       And nothing got done   I didn't do homework. I didn't clean up. I didn't do the laundry. I didn't finish my characters. I  did  call in to get the door fixed.  So, on Saturday I woke up to the tune of the badger song - you know,  urlLink this one . Apparently Morgan snuck into my room (which is easy, since I sleep like a boozed up rock, and my door is broken) and had it playing for the better part of an hour before I woke up. He was leaving for the UC to play XBox with the folks he works with. In the meantime I went with carol, Amber, and Tracy to "The Dreamworker" and got presents for Jeff. Then we got back (and another of my immobilizing scratch spots was found out), and we spent some time at Carol and Amber's. I got ticked until my stomach hurt. Then I went back, Morgan showed up shortly, we watched Army of Darkness on SciFi, then Greg and Matt and Aubrey showed up and we started the AD&D game. I almost got chewed to death, turned an orc pink, killed another enemy with the secret ninja move staff critical, set a whole lot of stuff on fire (including myself and the other party members)... And got the most experience out of it. Oh, and I found out that when I lick stuff now I can find out whether they are magical or not. By then it was 4am so we broke off there and I went almost straight to bed.  Sunday: five minutes after I wake up (I was with a pillow on my head, trying to go back to sleep) Amber IMs me, so I end up having to get up. She came over for some yerba mate tea, we talked random talk for about an hour, and Amber decided that she wanted to wake up Carol now. So she does. Everyone agrees that we should rent a movie, so we do, and get snacks... We watched Dreamcatcher and Dogma. And I got tickled a lot again... My sides still hurt. But it was fun. I got to lick both Tracy and Carol in retribution. This is going to be another of those precious moments in my "memory warehouse". Hmm... Time runs again.

       So much to do, so little time   At work, we found problems with the networked filesystem. Can't say that I know how to fix that yet. For class, I need to send in that reading assignment I missed. And I need to study for the second psychology test on Tuesday. And I need to prepare the assignments for the systems analysis and design class. And I need to do the readings for philosophy. And I need to think of a thought experiment for that same class.  For gaming, I need to finish my Exalted character. And my Vampire character. And I forgot to ask Jeff about the quick draw thing... And I need to get my door fixed. And get my name changed on Gods know how many records.  And do the laundry. And clean up my room.  *sigh*. Sometimes I wish that time could just stop, and that I could live in the same moment forever and ever. And then reality slaps me in the face and reminds me of my curse... Will I ever be able to settle somewhere? Will I ever be able to say "This is my home, these are my friends, here is where I stay"? I won't let that pull me down though. As long as I get remembered by the good things I left behind I'll be fine.

       Bite the news bullet   We got new shinies at work. Our workstation came in, so I set it up (Evan had to leave for class). All the old slave nodes on the cluster have been turned off, and we're running more of the new machines instead. They still need to have mpi set up properly, but now at least they balance the load much better. We had problems with one machine appearing and disappearing though... We think it's because we've reached the limit of the power grid in the room.  Since Evan is going to be using the new workstation most of the time I get the "old" Athlon machine. I'm installing BeOS on it at this very moment. The only difficulty for me is remembering which keyboard goes with which mouse with which machine. Once the Athlon machine is finished installing BeOS I'll have to migrate all the stuff over from the old Celeron. The room is really loud with 4 servers running... Those beasts scream like banshees. We had to resort to building a fort with old boxes around it to dampen the noise... It helps a bit, but not much.  Did I mention that we got flatpanel monitors now? One for the workstation, one for my machine. And we're planning on getting laptops for mobile platforms. We've been looking at brands, and the Toshiba and Fujitsu ones look best (the ultraportables). We don't mind them being slower as long as they're not too slow to run most of the games at low detail.  When I installed the new workstation I cleaned up the cabling layout for both disks. The desks are *much* less cluttered now.  We got all this stuff, but  the gigabit switch still hasn't arrived . Damn bastards.

       Musical Underdogs   This time I'll be brief. I just wanted to list some bands that I haven't mentioned often enough, even though they are just as great as those that I mentioned as my favorites a few days ago.  The top of this rank is taken by  Helloween . So, which songs do I recommend? All of them. Helloween is the Swiss army chainsaw of music. Following we have  Divididos ,  Sumo ,  Rata Blanca , and  Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota . All of them are great rock bands in Argentina, but they're nearly unknown outside of it. They got good stuff.  My friends know that I'm a sucker for  Blackmore's Night , so no need to talk about that.   Edguy ... Very similar in Style to  Bruce Dickinson . Moonspell .  Poisonblack . And I'm too tired to keep counting. Plus I said it'd be brief. So there.

       Lotus Cup   So, we went to the Lotus Cup tonight... Yesterday night... The night we are on that started yesterday. So, I was doodling in my folder, and one of the doodles inspired me. It started as a small doodle, a black pellet (a pearl maybe) from which a flame was rising. I was going to make a bigger one, but I was too bored to fill in a large circle in black with a pencil, so I doodled around with it and made a wee spiral inside. So now it looked like an eye on flame, and that's when the muses struck me. Now, this piece is not intended as literature... it is intended as a play, and gestures, expressions, and intonation are important, so I will interleave lines with instructions as to how it should be read. Usually the instructions come in two parts, separated by a forward slash ( / ). The first applies to the first half of the line, the other to the next. With a bit of imagination it should be easy to match them.   The Watcher  Can you see him? He can see you.   questioning look / "I know something you don't" look   He's watching... Can't you see him?   explaining / disturbed look   He stands in your shadows.  He follows your every move... Can't you see him?    stalk around / despaired look & voice   His eyes blaze like fire, but they shed no light.   entranced look, stare following imaginary eyes / confused look   His voice, a stampede... Can't you hear him?  cover ears, as if hearing loud noise / despaired look.   He's there... There... There... And There.  Point, point, point at people in the crowd / Point at own chest  OR  Point, point, point at shadowy places in the room / Wave hand behind self   He's screaming! Whispering.  Scream / Whisper   He's raking at you... Pleading at you  Rake air angrily / Despaired look, begging   Can't you see him?  You can't see him. But he's there... Waiting for you.  Disappointed look / Sweep crowd with a warning gaze (maybe point finger at some)   The basic idea of this play is to go through a wide set of facial expressions in a short time. An exercise, if you wish to call it so.

       Upsies and Downsies   Tuesday started so-so for me... With having to go to that cursed English Literature class and all. If we were doing something that resembled literature then at least it would be bearable, but it turns into an armchair philosophy class, and not one of the good ones either. Five minutes into the game one can start to smell the crap spewing from their mouths.  Well, at least I had a better day at work. I was actually productive! Evan decided to upgrade to the new openMosix kernel on the old machines, but of course they wouldn't work out of the box. So it was up to me to fix everything again. The new server where I installed Debian has crapped out... There are several packages missing, dselect is being a bitch with the location of packages, and so on and so forth. But in the end I was quite productive. We've decided that until the power drops arrive and I finish a proper Debian installation on  one  machine we're going to take all the RAM and the processor out of half of the machines and drop it into the other half, and use them as slaves on the old cluster (which was the reason for Evan upgrading the kernel). Since the supply of electrical power is an issue, we're going to have to take down 3 of the old machines for every new machine we boot up. I should start bringing ear muffs to work. Yeah, noise is going to be an issue. We're probably going to end up talking to each other by IM. Not as if we're not doing that already. Yes, we're nerdy bastards.  While I was at work I was IMing with Tracy, and she was a wee bit upset because of a certain comment posted on her blog, so Carol and I went over there for moral support. She seems to feel better now, so that's a Good Thing (tm). I consider her to be in the circle of my best friends, and my best friends are like family to me (just better), and I don't know about here, but in Argentina we take good care of our families.  Anyway, I went back for class (Psychology) which I was dreading because I thought that I had done really bad on that first Midterm. Well, I ended up doing better than I thought - 135 out of 160, which amount to about 84%. I had expected something more along the lines of 60-ish%, give or take 10. So that kind of made my day. I have to remember to say a prayer to The Lady for this... She definitively had a hand in this.  Finally, since Carol had invited Tracy and Jeff for dinner and I felt like cooking for someone I figured that it'd be only fair to invite Amber over for dinner. I made pork chops and broccoli and rice casserole. Morgan also made a pizza cookie (a cookie the size of a pizza) so we had that as dessert with tasty, tasty ice cream.

       Damn... Wednesday Already?   If there's one good thing about bad days is that time flies when the shit hits the fan. Well, most of the stuff I've managed to deal with, so I'm left with the things that I can't control (but maybe influence). There's the carpal pains for example (which is also the reason why I'll keep this short).  Lately I've been wondering whether Grad School is worth the effort. Sure, I get to do stuff I've liked so far, and I'll get to learn all sorts of neat things I hope, and Waterloo is a  lovely  place... But then I wonder whether it's really what I want to do. On days like these all I really wish for is a nice and quiet living, with a job that'll make me a living but where I don't have to be on my toes all the time. Computer Science is fun and exciting, but it's one of those careers where it's easy to get left behind. Cooking, for example, is different - and something I'd really like to do for a living at this moment.  Blargh... I'm rambling late night again.  Bad me, bad! Go to your place. And no treat either.

       1337ifying the system   Well, I finished the first complete version of the dsh script. The most difficult part was to manage all the different optional arguments, but I did the smart thing and looked at CPAN for a module that would do it for me, and lo and behold, there it was. I feel a bit sorry for the lackeys though - I let them try to work it out the hard way. Wait a minute, what am I saying? I don't fell sorry for them. It's not like they have anything else to do... Let them work their brains out.  Now, that script is only the first stage of the 1337ifying program. Now I want to take all the other scripts we're using and upgrade them. And soon I'll be the only one who knows how the whole thing works, muahahahaha! Job security it is.

       Of bashing scriptures and pearls   Well, it's more about Perl and bash scripts. On the cluster we're using this one set of tools, from the  urlLink KludgeKollection , to make our life a lot easier. Those scripts weren't doing exactly what we were needing, so today I said to myself "Hey, I'm smart. I can improvise pretty well. I can take a look at these scripts, and maybe modify them to our needs?". So I did. And I've concluded that the author of those scripts is a moron. Not a whack-your-head-into-a-lightpost kind of moron, just a this-script-sucks-big-donkey-**** kind of moron. Just by skimming over the contents of the file I could point out heavy design flaws... So I spent the greater part of an hour just rewriting the whole goddamn thing, making it stronger, faster... BETTER. I still got several additions for it in mind, which I'll probably work on tomorrow.  Oh, and another thing:  I got mail, yay! I got mail, yay! I got mail, yay!  I had ordered the Demons & Wizards CD, and it's here! It's just  SO cool! I love it! It's my  preciousss!    Endless stairs A guiding light It seams to shine bright But it's cold Wicked signs will mark our way Wicked signs will mark our way Mark our way Mark our way  Call me Messiah - I am god A true lord but alone Call me liar - oh I won't deny That I'm mad  Am I evil, am I good Mad existence, faith and greed  The universe a gallows Pole Extinction of the living soul  Towards the sun we'll keep moving Fate I hold in hand Dancing 'til the end I am condemned Oh I bring all mankind's end The end Oh I've seen All life die  A shattered heart, an empty soul Just one false move and it took it's toll The rising of an evil seed I can't describe the pain I feel Outside it's dark, inside it's cold The sun still shines bright But it's time is short  Endless stairs A guiding light That once was warm But now it's bitter cold  It's freezing hearts It's freezing souls Soon icy shades will cover all It pretends to be alive It pretends to be alive Be alive Be alive Be alive  Collapse of the mother All will die The void it frightens me I've faced the demon And he dwells inside  And when I laugh, it's tears I hide And when I cry, it's joy inside A fool disease has stained the land The bitter harvest of a dying bloom And when I cry, it's joy inside A wicked smile for all the tears I hide It hurts to hold all the pain I feel The bitter harvest of a dying bloom  Nothing is real Nothing but him

       Daily Update? We don't need no stinking Daily update!   Ok, ok... I'll be the first one to admit that I've been slacking as far as the blog goes. So, let's see, what happened last week?    Friday  Not much going on job-wise... We got all the machines up and running, all nice. There was this one bad bit of news (which gets exponentially worse as we travel into Saturday), but I'm not allowed to talk about it... Yet. So, after work I went to philosophy class... We discussed... What? I forgot. Anyway, Berkich said he'd have the papers graded and in his mailbox next week (which he doesn't, I checked today, and he hasn't returned my book either, which I need for the paper due Friday). I bet he hasn't even updated the website yet. But I digress. Charles and Rebecca didn't show up for philosophy, which means that they're in deep shit (figuratively) because they  did  show up after for Anime Club. Anime Club, yes... We watched Photon, Naruto, Wild Arms, Full Metal Panic? - Fumoffu, and... And... What movie was it? Ah, yes: Mezzo Forte. Really cool one. And we wrapped up with more Full Metal Panic because it's cool and funny and everyone seemed to like it. After, everyone that had stayed till the end went out for dinner, and I went home to take a nap. On the way I stopped by the girls' place to check on them, since they had both left early and some of us were worried about them. They were Ok, just tired.    Saturday  I got up around noon to the bad news that I'm not supposed to talk about and thus won't (unless  they  push it too far... If they do then I'll have to make them regret it).  I spent most of the evening procrastinating at the computer and practicing tae-kwon-do every half hour... It was a good way to vent all the anger, practicing punches and kicks. Oh, and I made a pie/cake thingee. Late afternoon Charles got online, and after some discussion all of us (Charles, Amber, Carol, Rebecca, me) decided to go to Waldenbooks, where we spent an hour or so browsing. Well, they did... I went straight for the Terry Pratchett section - I needed some humor. After that the girls dragged me (literally) into Victoria's Secrets and tried to make me model lingerie. Well, I was lucky though... Brian wasn't at work. And truth be told, I was glad that they could have fun at my expense, because they were  having fun , which means that I was having fun (being the emphatic person I am), which means that I wasn't thinking about the bad news... Anyway, after that we went to Taqueria Acapulco for dinner, and then to Half Price Books, and then to the girls' place and watched Fantasia 2000.    Sunday  Let's see... Got up late again, Worked out... Watched TV, got disgusted at the crap available, took a nap. When I got up again, Morgan had gotten back, and we were about to start gaming. The game that day was pretty entertaining actually... I had some really crazy surges, which were actually very useful. And there was a maze, and we set up traps (hehehee... That was fun... Let's do it again!). Then we went grocery shopping. And then I slept.    Monday  No class again... Work... Got there late. We did... Not much. Then the afternoon game. We got Chinese food for dinner. Gaming-wise it went ok... Maybe a little bit too slow for me, but then that could be because I'm of the ants-in-your-ass type, who can't stand still for 10 seconds. We  did get pretty far plot-wise, and it's not like there was no action at all. I guess I'm too used to taking the lead lately, and am having trouble stepping back. Anyway, we killed some stuff at the end. I only wish we had gotten a bit more experience... 100xp, that's all I'm asking for! I'm just  THAT  close from leveling up. Darn. I already know what feat I'm taking and everything. Oh yeah, and I got new dice. Who loves my dice? Who does?  I do!    Today  Got up early for a change! Went to work, did some homework, went to class, got really bored, went home to pick up the ketchup, went to work, had Evan make lunch (which is what we needed the ketchup for), ruined a hard drive (don't worry, it was a crappy one anyway), studied for the midterm later, played some on the XPS system at work, went to class again, took the midterm, got home, ate myself half sick on  Julio's corn chips , and now here I am. Considering whether I should give in and reply to the questionnaire myself... I can hear their voices calling, beckoning... "Go on, do it! You know you want to."

       Crazy week so far   I don't know what's wrong, but it seems like everyone I know (including myself) has some or another sort of problem this week. If The Lady has any hand in this, and I suspect she does - always meddling in people's affairs she is (but she's my deity and I love her a lot, thank you very much), then she'd better make up for it next week, or she will have a very... Upset... Follower. Sure, she's already made up for it in my case, but I certainly won't just stand there and watch while she toys around with my friends' lives.  Anyway, today at work we figured out why  Trogdor  was acting up - It turns out that it has a bad memory module. We've turned it off for the moment, and Evan is going to run the Dell diagnostics on it tomorrow (even though we already know that it's faulty... That's what  memtest86  is for) and ask them to get it replaced. Apart from that, we didn't get much done. I brought  Boondock Saints  to work today, and Evan just cracked up at the cat scene. He loved the movie, and just  had  to show it to his wife.

       Slow day  Hmm... I hadn't noticed how much of my life revolves around my friends until now that they're not here. Yeah, most of them went to Houston to Ren Fest. The day was pretty uneventful, leaving out work. That is, because all hell was breaking loose when I got there. Evan got the crazy idea to try to get the Dell gigabit switch on the cluster again, even though I've  told him a million times  that it's a piece of crap, so the entire cluster was freaking out, and it was up to me (again) to fix everything. *sigh* Well, once I got everything back to normal, I worked a bit on the password updating scripts. The problem was that I had to run those scripts as root, and had no idea how to do it. Well, eventually I told the other members in my SAD group to go look at alternatives (namely nis and ldap), while I kept hacking away at the scripts. It wasn't until much later hat I got a half-success - I managed to figure out the whole  setuid  thing. Basically setuid lets me run a program as the creator of the program, without my account needing the creator's permissions. So I tinkered around with it for a while and managed to update two out of the three files that I needed to synchronize. And I have a good idea of what's wrong with the third - it should be only a problem with the uid and gid settings in the rsyncd.conf file. And I also improved on the other scripts we had written the day before - the monitoring tools, and the updating and setup tools. In the evening we had Philosophy of Science Fiction. Well, it turns out that I was the only one who did his reading (well, part of it - I read some 30 pages out of over 50), so I did a wee little presentation for about 1/2 hour about it. Then we talked about the next writing assignment (gee, and I haven't even turned in the first one), and then we somehow came to the topic of the Game of Life and emerging computations. I really wish I had had my "The Science of Discworld" book on me for that (that reminds me that I have to ask Evan to return it to me).  After class I went home, got online for a bit until my network connection crippled itself, at which point I gave up and just went to bed for a few hours. I skipped anime club, as I really wasn't in the mood for that. I had planned to clean up my room this afternoon, but I figured I'd better do that by daylight. It's much nicer to stay in bed, all warm and cuddly with my softy blanket. Sure, it would have been so much better if I had my cuddly blanket  and  was with me friends, but you don't always get what you want. My only fear so far is that this kind of feeling will become common once I'm in Canada. That would make me a sad, sad panda.

       Week recap   Hmm, I've got a lot of catching up to do. Where to start? Well, let's do random bullets. * New stuff: All the stuff I ordered from Thinkgeek came in today. Christmas gifts for almost everyone on my list. And if you're not on my list then you don't deserve a gift from me. Where's my list? That, I won't tell you.  * More stuff: My Stratovarius stuff came in today too. Pretty shirt, cool CD. I'm happy.  * We're doing great at  urlLink the cluster . OpenMosix is working, we wrote our own neat monitoring software, tons of management automation scripts...  We are on a  roll ! * The fricken cold won't go away. But now I got me  urlLink magic blanket  (it's  soft ! It's  fluffy ! It's  warm ! It's  cuddly ! And  it says blanket ! Watch out Cold, you've got competition now! /dev/blanket is out to get you! * Wednesday night we went to watch  Matrix Revolutions . It started out good, with really smart dialogs, but as the movie went on it degenerated into a pretty mindless action flick. I was really disappointed with the ending, it felt rushed and left too many loose ends. I really hadn't expected much from it to start with (having read reviews of it at Slashdot), but I had hoped at least for an interesting plot twist, something unexpected. Instead we got bombarded with cliche after cliche. It wasn't a  bad  movie, but it's not one of those that I would pay to see at the theater.  * Tuesday... Oh yes, Mikey's birthday dinner. We had... Hamburgers, and onion rings, and fried 'tatos. And we watched...  Stigmata ? And then... What? Oh yes, I went home early, because I had to go to work early next day.  * I'm getting annoyed at Morgan... He's playing with that fricken ball in the living room and dropping it every minute or so. One of these days I'm gonna snap and grab that ball and bash his head in with it.  * Monday... Game! Yeah, so we started early, and we recovered the last item we needed, and are now heading back. We got attacked by some shadow mastiffs, and... That was it?  * My BeOS machine at work is freaking out. I fixed one of the problems (basically, I can't let the screensaver turn off the monitor... Else it won't restart again). I think I need to allocate more memory for the video card. I'm tempted to just put in the Matrox one. It sucks, but it's probably more stable than the craptastic built in one.  * Well, it turns out that I need to get my name change documents certified in Washington, because the Canadian government won't accept a Texas judge's signature as a legal document. So I'll have to get my visa as Claus W. Strommer, as on my passport, and not at Claus Spitzer, as per the document. I hate legal systems. So inefficient.  * Exalted. This night's game was  fun . I got a great chance to sew the seeds of dissent. I got the party to split up (well, it was  their  fault for backstabbing Pat, I just took the chance to retaliate in his name), so now they're wandering around without a map and me and Pat are the only ones with a clear idea of where to go. The stone is rolling, and there's nothing they can do to stop it.  It's fun to be evil!

       Anime Halloween Madness   Eh... Not much out of the ordinary happening there that I can recount, apart from the  urlLink strange events  during  Petshop of Horrors . Of course, after anime is when the fun started. We went over to Carol & Amber's for dinner, and decided that we were lazy, so we ordered pizza. Cyrus was nice and paid for all of it. We watched something... Can't recall what. Then Charles took Tracy and Jeff home, and we started talking about crazy stuff, and somehow (don't ask me, I wasn't involved in it) the conversation drifted towards dolphin sex, and someone pulled up a website about it, and Cyrus read  all of it , including the part about dolphins being able to wrap their penis around things, so now the word is out that he has dolphin penis envy.

       Exaltation & Treason   Thursday's Exalted game finally picked up the pace... Lots of weird shit happening. Pat's character got poisoned by Morgan and Matt's characters ("It was only supposed to knock him out" - riiiiight), Layla revealed another corner of her character's twisted thinking and took over Pat's legions, and me... Hehe, well, let's say that I got the opportunity to pull the party around by their nose. They have  NO  idea of what's in play for them *evil laugh*. I almost feel pity for the poor sods... No, wait, who am I kidding? No pity.

       Things are working out just fine   Never before have I felt that words of my faith being more true.  "The Lady takes first and then gives it back tenfold."  This last semester a lot has been taken from me, more than I would have wished to lose. But in the end, I got it all back, with interests. Very good things have been happening, and this last week something has been returned to me that I had thought lost forever -  HOPE . I do not doubt that The Lady had a hand in this, and for that I'm eternally grateful. I can now say that all those nights I spent alone in my room, tears threatening to break out, have not been in vain. I am happy beyond measure. Here's a toast to everyone who made it possible! (well, I'm toasting with water, since I'm not allowed to drink alcoholic beverages until next year, but the effort is what counts, isn't it?).

       To be loved...   It feels so nice to be loved... To know that one's passage doesn't go unnoticed. This night was a great revelation to me. A great emotional weight was lifter off more than just one person this night, and I think everything is better just for that. There are others that I need to talk to as well... Maybe with time, I'll find the courage to do so. I hope.

       Wow   Proving that I'm not beyond surprised yet, my parents dropped the big shocker for the night. I was guessing on it for a while, but tonight they confirmed it - they got me a new car! It's a silver 2001 diesel Jetta, really nice condition. And it drives like a charm! So now I'm working on the name.  arfl  is one choice (it's part of the license plate). Another one would be  Greebo . Or  Gaspode . Or something else. I'll sleep over it.

       So far...   Well, it wouldn't be a proper holiday without something going wrong. Like dad turning on the cleaning cycle on the oven  while the roast beef is in there . He turned it back off. But the problem with that oven is that it locks itself until it completely cools down. So we're digging into everything else in the meantime.

       It's good to have friends.   I think  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  about sums it up. It is hard having to leave everything behind. On Friday I could still hold it back a bit, until after watching  Lilo & Stitch . I just broke out crying in Carol's arms. And Saturday all I could think of during the graduation ceremony was how I wanted to see all my friends again. Dinner was good, and I got along well with my family (for a change), but... After tomorrow morning I won't be able to see my friends for a long time. Well, I'm getting ahead of myself there. Anyway, once dinner was over I scooted over to Tracy & Jeff's, since they were having their gaming night. To hell with packing, friends are more important. They were having a good time, which made me happy. And after everyone else left, I just couldn't bring it over myself to leave. I just wanted to stay there forever, with all the people that helped me get through the semester in one piece. I am not exaggerating when I say that I wouldn't have made it without them. After (heck, even while) all the shit had hit the fan this past Summer I was about to give up on myself. The one thing that kept me going was the knowledge that there was someone to return to. If not... If not I would have just withered away. So I was there for a long while, but with each minute I became more restless. My feet were tingling, and my stomach was turning circles. Because every minute that passed was a minute closer to good-bye, and I didn't want that. I  hate  good-byes. I really wanted time to stop right there and then. I really did. And all the time I kept thinking if there wasn't anything I could have done to stay a while longer. What if I had told my parents all of a sudden that I didn't want to go to Waterloo anymore? But I knew that I couldn't have done that. Because I would have caused more harm than the one I was avoiding, and I would have been selfish. I am my own bane. And I knew I couldn't avoid my curse. I cannot stay anywhere for long after making friends. Something will always drag me away kicking and screaming. I am destined to remain a memory only. But I am fighting it with every ounce of strength in me. I will see these friends again, even if I have to drag all of Canada behind me to do it. I will...I will... I will be back.  It pained me a lot to have to leave these friends. A  lot . And again it was up to me to be the bastard and be the one that forced in the departure. I almost didn't though. When I went down the stairs my feet felt like lead, and when I was leaving the building I nearly turned around. But... But I am a coward. I couldn't face them anymore. I wouldn't have been able to go on being a bastard. Step after step I dragged myself to the car and drove back to my apartment, and cried myself to sleep. Hah! How true that song sounds right now...   ...  And when I laugh it's tears I hide And when I cry it's joy inside A foul disease has stained the land The bitter harvest of a dying bloom And when I cry it's joy inside A wicked smile for all the tears I hide It hurts to hold all the pain I feel The bitter harvest of a dying bloom  ...   *sigh* Saturday was both the happiest and the saddest day in my life. And all I can think of now is  O'Hana means family. Family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten . Nobody. Nobody will be forgotten by me. They will forever have my heart and soul.  Tomorrow morning I'm leaving for Canada. This is it. I'm gone. I... I don't know what to do. After this, how can I make new friends? How can I face my life and the prospects of yet another good-bye? They say it's a small world... But how come that it feels like the distances separating us are infinite? That it would take an eternity to see them again? If this is such a small world, then why can't I stay with those I love most? I promised that on the first opportunity I get to visit I would be there with them, and I plan to keep that promise. But... But what if I'm forbidden from having such an opportunity for two years?  WHY THE FUCK  can't I get back for two years after my studies are over?  WHICH ASSHAT  decided to put that clause in a student visa? Xenophobic fucktards. I don't want money, I don't want power, I don't want control... I just want my friends back. I want to be happy, and I want them to be happy. Is that too much to ask for?

       I swear I'll won't touch a drop of alcohol again   ...Well at least until new year. My  head ! So this is what happened: We were at the party at Keith's yesterday. There was a  lot  to drink. And I had brought 10 pounds of spare ribs. Yum! But I digress. I barbecued the ribs. There's no problem with that. But I also had way too much to drink. Starting on an empty stomach. 4 Coronas, 4 or 5 shots of Rumpelmintz, and a shot of Southern Comfort, 100 proof. Well, that was the last one I remember. Which was, I took the shot, I put the bottle back into the fridge, I closed the fridge, and started walking out of the kitchen. On the way I apologized to Keith's roommate because I hadn't been paying attention to the last batch of ribs (which he was eating) so they could have been overdone, and he said they were fine. Then... NOTHING. That would have happened around 9pm I reckon. The next thing I remember is someone giving me a bucket or something and asking me to try to throw up (which I did) and me thinking "How did I get to the couch?". And in between there was Carol talking about "Lilo & Stitch". And I was asking for an aspirin. And then they were ushering me into Carol's car, and me asking them to get my bag (the one with the laptop), and then Carol drove me home. On the intersection of Ennis and Nile I remember getting angry at the light for being so bright (and I  know  it was that intersection, because I asked). Then I passed out on Carol's couch. Which was around 1pm. Doing the math, I lost 3 hours of my memory. There's absolutely nothing in there. Zip. Nada.  So that's what I remember. Now from what I've been told here's what happened: Supposedly after the Southern Comfort shot I walked outside, was there for a while, and then walked in and asked for a drink. Well, I got a drink.  A glass of vodka . Not a shot. An entire glass. Next thing they know, I'm falling to the floor in the kitchen (which really scared Carol). So they drag me into the living room, onto the couch, and supposedly I turned into a sobfest (I'm not sure what I was crying about, but the most probable reason would be having to leave all these good friends behind - I admit to having cried about that before), and they took turns taking care of me. Apparently at some point I had buried my face in Emily's chest, and Richard has a picture of it. Then they decided to make me throw up to get all that shit out of my stomach. Which is where I started remembering again. Yeah. That's something I won't be doing again anytime soon. Or later. Or at all.  So what else happened this week? Well, there's the paperwork issue. So, I checked on my sail account for my grades, and lookee there, one of the grades is missing. That asshat of a professor hadn't submitted it! SO I had to wait until that was done (which happened last night). Well at least  now  I have done everything needed for the Study Permit. I just hope that the letter of admission gets here before I leave, or I'm going to be in  really  deep shit. The good news though is that there is a good chance that there will be housing there waiting for me - at the very least a temporary one. The bad (unrelated) followup is that the asshats at the court here lost my namechange paperwork. Fucking great eh? And I thought I had left all that behind when I got away from Buenos Aires.  Argh, my head feels light as a feather. It's not painful, but it feels... Weird. It's probably the loss of weight from all the neurons I killed off yesterday. That does it. I'm taking another nap.

       Time to relax a bit. But not too long   Yay! I finished all my classes. And I found out from the consulate that I can file the study permit application in person, in which case they might actually get it done in a day or two. I've spent the last two days relaxing. I can't start to tell how stressed out I was. Remember that nasty,  naasty  cough I had? It's gone! Poof. Vanished. Kapput. Auf wiedersehn.  Gone .  I can only regret that I have to leave in a week. On the one hand, I don't mind leaving this cesspool of political bile. But on the other hand, my best friends are here... I will miss them  a lot . The majority of my good memories during my stay here are related to them. I can confidently say that I've become attached to them. I will be lonely up in Canadia without me friends... I guess I'll have to work hard to find new ones, but I definitively want to stay in touch with the current ones.

       Bloody fucking hell   Well, I did it again - I left the blog unattended for what seems like eons. What, you're still surprised? By now you should be used to it. So, what happened in the meantime? Well, for starters, I've been running all over the place like a headless chicken. Why? Well, because I cannot get my study permit for grad school in Canada until I get my letter of admission from Waterloo. And I cannot get that one until I graduate. And I cannot graduate until I finish all my courses this semester. If I were to leave everything to its course I wouldn't graduate until the 20th. Which is the day before I'm supposed to leave for Canadia (yes, Canadia, I like to call Canada Canadia, any problem with that? I thought not. Wanker). And there's NO way that those lazy bastards at the consulate would process my study permit over the Christmas weekend. Well, I'm lying there. The Canadian consulate in Buffalo has some very nice people, and unlike those f*cking bastards at the US embassies they actually process your stuff right there, on the same day. You walk in one morning with your documents, and by noon you're ready to cross the border. Not at all like those paranoid ignorants at you know where. *Sigh* That felt good. Anyway, I still reckon that the study permit would not be processed on Christmas week. And I need to be ready and settled in Waterloo by the 7th of January. I think. They keep changing their mind, telling me on one side that I have to be there two weeks before classes start to get training for my job. Well, both sides say that. Where they dissent is on what date that is. One side says classes start on the 7th, and I have to be there 2 weeks before... Which puts me there on the 23rd. Which I  seriously  doubt is correct, but it's the earlier date so it's safer to assume that I have to be there right after Christmas. Plus I told that to my family, that way I don't have to spend so much time with them. Mind you, they're my family and I love them, but I prefer to love them at a distance. I don't know, it's something in the blood I'd guess, but I get more jumpy the more time I spend with them. It's not just me... But I'm the only one that openly shows his feelings on that matter. But I digress. The other side says that I have to be there on the 7th, and that classes start 2 weeks after that. I hope with all I can hope with that this is the case, but I learned not to trust my hopes on such matters. For all I know, classes started on the 7th of December and they're all fucking around with my head. Sideways.  And here? Well, I have to write this f*cking paper for Philosophy. At least I finished the  other two  that were due for the same class, and the final report for SAD. But I am getting tired of having to rush so much. And my parents are not doing anything to help. Nooooo, they expect me to quit everything here on the drop of a pin. Couldn't even enjoy a good final summer vacation. It's not that I have anything in particular against them, but their definition of relaxing is not my definition of relaxing. Let me tell you what they think is relaxing: Spending hours with them, doing housework, in complete boredom. Let me tell you what  I  think is relaxing: spending time with me friends, doing stuff that is entertaining, and most important of all, that is distracting. When I get bored I start thinking, and when I start thinking I get depressed, because I don't really have anything better to think about when I'm bored than all the shit that happened to me in my life. On the other hand, when I'm distracted, I still think, but I think about the happy stuff, so that's good. But I don't expect that they'll ever understand that. No, they want me to be what they think is the male model, and they want me to do what they think is the right stuff. Ohh, no,  of course  the problem is with me when I snap at them. Because I  snap at everyone , right? FUCK NO. I got more patience than you can shake a stick at. But they always,  always  manage to freak me out. Because they can't accept the fact that I am different from them. *Sigh* I guess I'm selfish too for wanting to spend my last Christmas here with my friends instead of the people that I can spend other holidays with? And it's not like I get to know these things in time. No, I'm always the fucking last person who ever gets told anything. Just today I hear that the honors ceremony was on Saturday. And did anyone from the University tell me? Fuck no! Bloody bastards, all of them.

       Weekend of Hell and Heaven   Time to catch up again. Well, probably the only thing I have to say in my defense now is that there was no chance for me to blog from where I was. So, let's start then: *  Wednesday night  - Went over to Jeff and Tracy's, met Shawn. Interesting guy, knows a lot about music. Has a neat Giger deck too.  *  Thursday  - Off to Deer Camp. Got there early afternoon, went out to track some deer, didn't shoot anything (except for beer cans & bottles), got rip-roaring drunk, passed out.  *  Friday  - Got up early to hunt deer, sat in the blind for 10 minutes, then everyone decided to go back and take a nap. Agonized the entire morning due to a hangover. Andy arrived. Went for a trek to the old foxhole. Got back, had dinner, got slightly drunk, saw lots of shooting stars, passed out.  *  Saturday  - Got up not so early, had breakfast, went for a hike up the hill by the pig pen. Got back, Chuck arrived, the others went hunting, we decided to get drunk before everyone got back in case they got a deer and wanted us to help clean... The rest is a blur, but I remember my "cool" idea of using an electric fan to fan up the bonfire (and it worked like a charm too), and that Evan promised to throw a party at the end of the semester to which everyone at the Anime Club is invited. *  Sunday  - Actually got up early, packed up while Chuck and Andy and Tony were hunting, finished packing, Chuck got back with a 9 point (and for some reason an extra leg), we left. Got back home, had a shower, went with the girls to Jo-ann's and then to World Market, went to Tracy's, got back, passed out.

       Trust me! I know what I'm doing...   I woke up this morning with the attitude  urlLink I had scraped up earlier . Rather early, on top of that. I  knew  that I'd have to spends some time getting my car out of the snow (which mainly consists of brushing it off the car and scraping the ice off the windshield). What I didn't expect was having to spend ten minutes shoveling to free the tires. But it was good exercise, and the cool air was quite refreshing actually, what with there being hardly any wind. I got to school just in time (good thing I didn't stop at  urlLink Tim Hortons  for my usual tea and donut. Yes, you read right,  tea  and donut. I'm glad to tell you that I haven't touched coffee for over a month now. Anyway, as I was telling, I got to  urlLink class  just in time, still feeling a bit down about school... And after 50 minutes I was a changed man. Yep, hard to think that one course can change my opinion about school, but this one somehow cheer me up every time I go. It probably has to do a lot with the fact that the entirety of the course revolves around in-class discussion and there's practically no lecture.  After class I spent a little time configuring an Apache webserver as a proxy so that I can use my IM from school. Which reminds me: There is something wrong about the security on a campus when they are in the process of disabling ftp in favor of sftp but actually cheer people on to use  telnet  to log into their accounts. Shame on them I say.  In the afternoon I began freaking out because I had no clue what to do for the  urlLink Software Architecture  assignment, what with starting late and all. And  then  I met with Lixiao (who happened to be without a team as well so we paired up) and it turns out that it's a piece of cake. Her software model had some minor bugs in it which I ironed out, and now I'm writing up the dependencies and module interactions. This turns out to be easier than I thought. I think I'm actually going to enjoy this class as well! When I got back I went through another shoveling adventure... The driveway had about 2-3 inches of tight packed snow. I figured that it would be no problem to get in, what with me being able to leave in the morning.  Big mistake . I got maybe two feet into the driveway when the wheels started spinning free. I had to dig myself out of the snow again. So I said "screw this" and parked the car on the street, and then I spent some good twenty minutes clearing the driveway.  And then the nap. Mmm, I so do love those.

       Snowy   So... Yeah. I got up this morning, all freaked out because I had almost overslept a meeting at 8:30. So I leave in a hurry, only to find out that school's closed because of the bad weather. I should have stayed in bed, but nooo, I had to do the responsible thing. Well sod that. So I went back home and got ready to get some rest. At which point I get a really nice phone call. With an even nicer followup online. Hehe. Mwehehe. Anyway, after that I went to do some groceries - and I was thinking of doing the homework I was supposed to have done yesterday, but then the sensible me took over and I decided that since school's out for the day so should I be. So I went to bed and slept. A lot. It's the nicest thing about the cold weather - being able to say "Fuck this, I'm staying in bed".

       So very tired   I'm exhausted. Tired. I feel as if my bones were missing. Right now, there's nothing I'd want to do more than just go back to take a nap. Um, wait. I take that back, there  are  things I'd rather do. Oh yes. Specially today. They don't include, however, things like doing homework, driving back to Waterloo, or doing anything productive to society.  I haven't noticed how out of sync I still am with school. Last semester I've gotten used to do - well nothing. I was at work most of the day, and I can do that. But school - spending hours at a computer looking up material... I can't do that anymore. Which means that I'm having second thoughts about my Ph.D. I might just go for a job after the Masters. Or maybe it is just that I need a sabbatical from studying. And computers. I might just work at a restaurant for a year or so, to clear my head. DO something that I  really  like to do. *shrugs* Eh, it'll work out somehow. But now I'll go call someone. Because I want to.

       Jumping on the quiz bandwagon   Since everyone else seems to have done it. Yeah, I'm a peer pressure whore. Live with it.   1) Using band names (or artists), spell out your first name: Creedence Clearwater Revival Luis Alberto Spinetta Alice in Chains U2 Stratovarius  2) Have you ever had a song written about you? If you count all the Christmas songs written about Santa, then yes.   3) What song makes you cry? There are many  Blind Guardian  songs that catch me on the soft side, such as  The Eldar  and  Thorn . And then of course there's  Demons & Wizards - Gallows Pole .   4) What song makes you happy? Oh, there are so many... But if I had to pick one, I'd go with either  Carnaval toda la Vida  by  Los Fabulosos Caddilacs  or  Bobby Mc Ferrin - Don't worry, be happy .  5) What do you like to listen to before bed? Whatever is on the playlist. And since that includes everything I own, then it could be just about anything, from Heavy Metal to Electronica to Tango.  6) Name a song by Coal Chamber. No clue. And I hope that's not a real song title, or I'd feel very awkward.   7) Who was/were your idol/s when you were younger? Isaac Newton. Then I found out he was a crook, and that didn't change a thing. He was a fricken genius.  8) First album you ever bought? AC/DC - Live.

       Small changes   If you pay close attention to the right, you'll notice that I've split up the links section. Exhibit A here at the top is the list of blogs and livejournals of people I know. Exhibit B contains standard issue geeky links. Both are sorted alphabetically.

       Fire. Meat. Good   For those who are wondering what that's all about: It's a hamburger chain's slogan. Mmm... Beef. Today was the first day in  Software Architecture . This one's a keeper. And in a world that seems to be running on one or another flavor of UNIX (half of the machines here run Solaris... *shudders*), this professor takes a stance for Linux. Good. Now we're going into familiar terrain.  I have to get a crossover cable. There's no way I'm going to pay $4.50 a month for them to plug my fucking ethernet port into the switch. So technically the old laptop (P150) running Debian is off the net, because it doesn't support cardbus peripherals, and the WiFi card is one of those. BUT - the other laptop (running Windows) does, so I'm going to route requests from its ethernet card to the WiFi connection, and voila. All I need then is the crossover cable, and I'll be free of csh hell! Long live bash! Long live ping! All hail fortunes!

       Weird in, weird out   First of all... YEARGH! *head explodes*    Aphrodite/Eros    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Greek Gods Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Good grace, how the hell did that happen?  It's the third week of class, and I'm already exhausted. Sure, all that long distance driving could have something to do with it... Bleh. I'll have to see where things go... In class, at work, and about the... Other... Stuff.  *stretches* Eh, it's nice to procrastinate. It is.

       And the week ends   Crazy stuff, school here. I am settled in one class -  Social Implications of Computing  is a keeper. But the other one... I dropped  Intro to AI  because it had  Algorithms  as a prerequisite. Now I'm taking  Software Architecture . The one good thing about it is that it's only one day a week. Oh, and I'm submitting a paper to the Graduate Research Conference. First prize is a PDA, worth $500. Sweet deal, for just a 10 minute presentation.  I went back to visit my parents for the weekend. Mom wants me to set up one of the laptops in the kitchen, so that she can e-mail from there, because she doesn't like the basement, which is where her computer currently is. Probably the best thing is to get her a WAP and a WiFi card, that way she can use it wherever she wants to - even in the garden, during the summer.  The weather has been really cold here this year - even Waterloo residents are having problems. I'd be fine with it, if only the wind wasn't blowing. Even a 5 mph wind can seriously hurt you at these temperatures.  Finally, last night I had a pretty long discussion with certain people about... Umm... Some things. Which are getting complicated. I really don't know what to do at this point. I just hope that I don't mess this one up.

       Grinding away the hours   So I'm finally settling down up here. After a lot of effort I got to meet my advisor, which in many points resembles my old advisor. And classes... Well, there's the good ones and there's the bad ones.  Social Implications of Computing  is quite enjoyable, and a definitive keeper.  Algorithms  is not. It reminds me too much of  Discrete Math . And  Intro to AI  is even worse - most of the formulas are gibberish to me. The only saving grace to it is that I'm much more advanced in the logic area than students here, and half of the class is about that.  The computing environment here is very different from A&M. First of all, there's no Linux. Just Solaris and Unix, and  neither of them have fortunes installed . Sacrilege! Well, at least I can still use the cluster for all my Linux needs, and for Windows boxen I borrowed my dad's laptop and Wi-Fi card. I just can't wait till my BeOS box finally gets shipped.  Work... Well, it's just started. I got the first batch of assignments, which got split among all of the TAs for the class. There's four of us. Yesterday one of the senior TAs showed me around the campus a bit. I finally got around to visit the grad house and their selection of draft beers - didn't get any though. But I  did  find out that there are wine tasting and beer tasting and other cool clubs around. The talks about quantum computing sound interesting.  There's still al lot to do however. For once, I need to ask for a PC instead of a thin terminal client, and ask for permission to put Debian GNU/Linux on it. And I got to check out the clubs. And the parties - can't forget those. And roleplaying groups. Maybe I can inflict my characters on other people, hmm?  Getting a regular sleeping pattern would be nice too. I'm up early in the morning most days. Then during the evenings I basically just sleep, and at night... Well, let's just say that nights are interesting enough.

       Round and round she goes indeed...          I am The Wheel of Fortune    The Wheel of Fortune represents unexpected encounters and twists of fate.

When the energy of the Wheel arrives, you will feel life speed up. You are caught in a cyclone that may deposit you anywhere. "Round and round and round she goes, and where she stops, nobody knows."

Month:   Day:   Year:          That was a jolly surprise.  Not!  Well, maybe. A bit. We did the nose. And the hat.  The weekend was... Eventful. Really interesting things happened. Some of them, well, I would have liked to go differently. But it could have gone worse. And to that special someone, if you're reading this, I'm not mad at you. Not a single bit. You did what you felt was right, and I fully understand your position. So don't go on getting depressed about it or anything, because I  will  find out. And do something about it. Something nice, that'll cheer you up.  Sunday I went back to Waterloo (oh yeah, I didn't tell you that I was spending it with my parents in Kingston, did I?). I went to see one of the places renting rooms, and the landlady had told me that if I liked it I could move in immediately. It turned out to be not exactly as nice as the one I'd seen before, but it was available immediately, and it was cheaper. So I said "what the hell, it's only 4 months" and took it. So now I got a new address! Yay for me. I pretty much went to sleep right after moving in.  Today was eventful too, in a different kind of way. I started the day with "Social Implications of Computers", a very interesting class. Definitively a keeper. Then there was a run to the bank to start my account. Which I did. Yay. Then back to school. Get the key to my office. Get my computer account. Find out that it's not working. The account, not the computer. Have to go activate it. Then to class - Algorithms. Darn boring too, but I had brought books, so no harm done. Then... Well, since I had no computer and needed to write my paper due for tomorrow, I decided to drive back to Kingston (yeah, I'm crazy, so what?). At least now I'm going to be taking the laptop with me, and tomorrow I'm getting a wireless card, and hopefully then I'll have internet access. No printer yet, but something is something. Now... Well, I think a nap is in order, then I'll hopefully get up in time to talk to some folk online, then off to Waterloo again. It'll be another long day I'm afraid.

       Well isn't that special?   And the World gets turned upside down again.  This time it was my turn to talk seriously to someone. A  special  someone, and a beautiful one on top of that (despite her claims to the contrary). Things turned out well... A lot of things that needed to be said were said. I am glad that I found the courage to do it.  I was planning on going to Waterloo this morning, but was exhausted due to lack of sleep. What I did instead was sift through the list of apartments and get the half dozen that most appealed to me. And... Um... I got a new phone.  So, I finally got in contact with my advisor. Surprise surprise... Classes have already started! Oops. Well, there's not much that I can do about it now. So I'm not going to worry. Not that I care anyway... I've got more than my share of happy moments last night.

       Yeargh   This it getting tiring. And the semester hasn't even started! Here's the recount:  - Sunday evening - Trip to Buffalo. No problems at the border (it was  too  good to be true... Read on for details. Arrived late in Buffalo. Went to sleep.   - Monday. Got up early, got passport picture, went to consulate. Bitch says I need bank statement. And medical examination. By the time it took to get it, consulate is closed. Sux0ring ensues. Slept the rest of the day (and night).   - Tuesday. Went to consulate (again). Bitch says "where is I-94". SUX0R! Customs officer never gave me one. Also, bitch could have told me that yesterday. Trip to border and back. Too late again. Got on internet, found on Canadian Immigration website that I  don't  need medical exam.   - Wednesday. Go to consulate. Give bitch paperwork. Tell her I don't need medical exam, for quote-and-quote reason. Bitch says Letter of Admission missing. I think "BITCH! I JUST GAVE IT TO YOU!". Turns out it was upside-down and she's an idiot. I ask to see her supervisor. An hour later, I get my Study Permit, no medical examination, no other problems. Bitch is very nice to me all of a sudden. Off to Canadia! Waterloo, to be specific. Several-hour-drive, eventless except for the fact that we find the car missing its gas tank cap. Waterloo: Turn in my study permit. Got to talk to housing. No on-campus housing available. Get big-ass list of off-campus housings. Will spend all night reading and selecting. Go see if advisor is in office. Not. Drive back to Kingston. 3/4 hours. To do: Get bank account. Get cellphone. Get apartment. Get dad to hospital for biannual checkup. Get sleep. Get Smart. Err... DEFINITIVELY get sleep. Get campus ID. Get insurance. Get enrolled in courses. Get bills. Pay bills. Get gas cap for car. Get a drink. Now. . .  Back. Talk to... Um, someone. Ain't telling who. Get Canadian drivers license. All that and more before Tuesday. Fucking great, eh? Also: FUCKING NETSCAPE! LET ME SEND MY FUCKING E-MAIL! FUCKTARDS! ALL OF THEM! *throws hands up in disgust and walks away*

       And another episode draws to its conclusion   Tomorrow I'm going to Buffalo, and on Monday I'll be at the consulate to get my study permit. I don't expect anything to go wrong... The procedure is fairly normal, and there's no reason for them to give me any trouble. With luck they'll give me the permit on the same day, if not the next, and since I already have my visa (the worst thing that'll happen is that I'll have to extend it), and then I'm set for school. Well, mostly. I'd have to drop by the office at Waterloo and get cleared to sign up for courses, and then I will need to talk to the person in charge of housing, but that's too far into the future to worry about. Right now I'm a bit tired... I've been up late yesterday *waggles eyebrows*. I think I'll take a nap. Yeah, that sounds nice.

       Don't you love...   ...Quiet evenings? I know  I  do. I like to do nothing but lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Maybe read a book. But no running around the place, no appointments to keep up... Just  wasting  time.  On another note, here's the results from a quiz I took. No big surprise really.    Mage: You can bend and twist reality to your whims as long as you are willing to pay the price. Knowledge fuels you, and spurs you to new and challenging heights on a regular basis. Magic is your tool of choice, and no matter how you invoke its power, you can control and shape it to your whims. You try to slowly change consensual reality in order to allow others to experience your power, as well as lessen the negative effects of casting your spells. One day you hope to transcend this mortal husk that binds you and become something greater.   urlLink   What type of World of Darkness Creature Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       2004   Well, it's really just another number. But things as small as a number can mean a lot to us. They announce new chances, and we use them as closure for old issues. If there is any magic in numbers then these are it - the magic is not in the number itself, but in how we think of them. Happy new year everybody, and may The Lady's blessings go with you all.

        urlLink A day to remember    Well, after the  urlLink fiasco  yesterday I spent a great deal at night redoing the whole fucking thing. The good news is that I finished not only with the top-level architecture repair, but also with subsystem repair. The bad news is that now I need to write up the report for the whole thing. Well, at least I got a good night's sleep... Something I haven't had for quite a while.

        urlLink Somebody shoot me    I spent all afternoon working on this cursed assignment. What I had to do was take the concrete architecture of Gnumeric, which we had constructed before based on our conceptual architecture. Now this isn't exactly difficult. But it's horribly tedious. One needs to go through nearly every file, weigh all the backwards dependencies, and choose which module they belong in. We had already done a rough job there, but the structure is rather horrible, and there are rogue dependencies to the left and the right. Not to mention that in case of most orphans (files that don't belong into the module they are in) don't show clear signs of where they should go. So one has to sift through the functions they contain, and then go through all the other files that use it, and find some indication as to where they belong.  Well, I had done a pretty good job fixing the top-level architecture, and was about to send it off to my lab partner. So I close the architecture viewer and copy the file up one directory to archive it and e-mail it off... And that's where I made the first mistake. Which turned out to be the last one too. Because the directory where I had run the viewer from was not the directory where the changelog was. No, it was the  backup  directory, and what I copied was the original file... Over the changelog. Hours,  hours  of work ruined in a second.

        urlLink When things go bad    I shamelessly stole that link from  urlLink Richard's blog . So, this week has been quite weird for me. I've been awfully tired. Pretty much all the time. If I had my way I'd be sleeping all day and night. But I don't, so I can't. The closest reason I can think why I'm this tired is the large number of caffeinated drinks I consumed last weekend, and that I relapsed into caffeine dependency. Oh, well, it's not the end of the world. And I just happen to  like  sleeping, so no harm done.  Now to the good news: I did my Ontario driver's license last Thursday, so now I don't have to rely on the Texas one anymore.  Even better news is what got here in the mail yesterday. It's shiny, lovely, and I'm wearing it right now (no, it's  not  a pair of golden pants.) It's a little bit too tight, but close enough to fit most of the time (not, it's not  that  either... Pervert.) So once I get off my lazy tired ass and get to work I'll be showing it off all over the place. But first, lunch. Which is not until 2 hours from now, so I'm going to bed again.

Which I wouldn't have worried about, except for the simple fact that it arrived in the one mailbox that I normally don't get any spam in. So I looked at the headers:   ----------8&lt;-------------- ...

That is unusual, because I don't officially use it except to receive mail from my official address. Furthermore, I don't even advertise that address! This again makes me believe that UW's e-mail got opted into mass mailing lists.  Tsk tsk tsk ! Shame on them! Of course I could think sensibly and assume that the address is on  some  page and has just been harvested. But that is only the beginning. A quick  urlLink Google search  for the offending company indicates that there are several such mails, all addressed to a different industry sector. The whole issue reeks of spam.  I also did a little whois on the URL posted at the bottom of the e-mail, and found this:   ----------8&lt;-------------- Domain ID:D103443577-LROR Domain Name:TECHADVICE.ORG Created On:14-Dec-2003 11:01:46 UTC Last Updated On:17-Feb-2004 22:34:40 UTC Expiration Date:14-Dec-2004 11:01:46 UTC Sponsoring Registrar:R91-LROR Status:OK Registrant ID:GODA-04811183 Registrant Name:  Hellen Vo   Registrant Street1:6805 Louise Ave #510 Registrant City:Van Nuys Registrant State/Province:California Registrant Postal Code:91406 Registrant Country:US Registrant Phone:+1.8185718328 Registrant Email:hellenv105@aol.com Admin ID:GODA-24811183 Admin Name:Hellen Vo Admin Street1:6805 Louise Ave #510 Admin City:Van Nuys Admin State/Province:California Admin Postal Code:91406 Admin Country:US Admin Phone:+1.8185718328 Admin Email:  hellenv105@aol.com   Tech ID:GODA-14811183 Tech Name:Hellen Vo Tech Street1:6805 Louise Ave #510 Tech City:Van Nuys Tech State/Province:California Tech Postal Code:91406 Tech Country:US Tech Phone:+1.8185718328 Tech Email:hellenv105@aol.com Name Server:  NS1.SUSPENDED-FOR.SPAM-AND-ABUSE.COM   Name Server:NS2.SUSPENDED-FOR.SPAM-AND-ABUSE.COM ----------8&lt;--------------   But wait, there's more! A search for Hellen Vo produced   urlLink this  . And a search for her e-mail address brought  urlLink this  up. Finally, a reverse whois on the ip from which the mail originated indicates that is comes from  Giant Food Inc . Which looks like a legitimate business, but has nothing to do with computers. Looks like they're being used as a spam relay. Neither does it seem to me that  urlLink Michael Byrne , whom byrne@acm.org seems to belong to, is a person who indulges in spam propagation. Who knows, maybe I should drop him an e-mail?

        urlLink Let the show begin    Well, I finally got to a point where I can rest. Believe it or not, today is the first day here that I'm not lagging behind with some kind of assignment. Shame that it won't last long - tomorrow I got to do the presentation I've been working on during most of the weekend. It's supposed to be just 20 minutes, so I've had to do a lot of work cutting back on material. I've pretty much dumped all of the math part.  Then of course there's the project for Software Architecture. After lots of struggling (and giving up) with software that depended on GTK but wouldn't build I decided to go with non-GUI software. First choice was lam-mpi, but that didn't work out because the tools used to build the architectural landscape have trouble parsing cxx objects. So I tried ssh, and finally got something working all the way. Now the only decision is whether we'll write the concrete architecture of it (it's rather small for that) or if we'll trace the evolution of the system. Eh, we'll see.  Now, if you haven't clicked the above link, do so. There's a really neat video there. I keep getting amazed at the neat stuff Hubble finds. Now if only the folks at NASA were to stop being such asshats and worry more about the scientific value of Hubble than about politics and money, then we could look forward to many more pretty things from the space telescope. But as it stand, they won't do a damned thing to maintain it, so it is expected that the chance of its orbit decaying and Hubble burning up in our atmosphere by 2006 is about 50%. And going up. The worst thing is that the next space telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2014. That's 8 years of stalled astronomy. But NOO, instead they work on space weaponry. Idiots.

        urlLink The ups and downs of a Valentine    My morning was great. I talked to two people I care a lot for, and doing that made me very happy. I was overjoyed, as a matter of fact. Then I went to take a nap, but for the first time in... Hmm, in a long time... Since mid-January, I have to say, I did not sleep well. I kept turning over and over, but there was something nagging in my mind. It was that today, eight weeks ago, I said the final good-bye. On that Saturday I last saw everyone from the pack. I really miss them. I miss the mirth, I miss the company. I'm meeting people here, but it's just not the same. I left part of my heart in Corpus Christi, and as much as I may complain about the city, it was my home for almost four years. Many of my fondest memories are from that time. What got left behind is more than just friends... It's a family.

        urlLink Damn the Winter, damn you, and damn the Wright brothers!    Ok, I don't mind the cold. I  like  cold. What I have an issue with is the wind. It turns cold into  fucking freezing , and no tin the fun way. This morning was nice. Heck, even the sun was shining, and temperatures were nice enough that one could walk around with just a sweater on and that was ok. But then it got bad.  The university here is ok, but there are some points I just can't agree with - like copy services charging almost $4 for a 2 page fax. And there is not much activity going on as far as cutting-edge research goes. It's almost as if the professors and students are afraid to take the risks. I think I know what one of the causes of this is - unlike TAMU-CC, here it is not considered ok to have a project which turns out to be crap. At A&M, we are encouraged to take the positive side of it and write a dissertion on why the project failed, which creates a legacy so that other students avoid the same problems. But here they think that a failed project equals a failed researcher. Which has probably a lot to do with the number of business ties that the university has.  BTW, it seems that the source code for Windows NT and 2000 has been leaked. Microsoft has confirmed this to the BBC, and blames somebody in St. Petersburg. Evan for once welcomes our Russian mob overlords. I on the other hand voted for Kodos.

       Things I hate when driving   1) Asshats driving at night, on a 6 lane highway with heavy traffic, during snowy/rainy days,  with their high beams on .  1.5) Fucktards with those halogen headlights. Yes, you can see better with them because  they're the equivalent of a normal high beam . Goddammit, I thought I'd go blind. The only exception are the bluish ones - those are actually pretty easy on the eyes. But still worse than a standard headlight.  2) Tailgating asspants. If you want to go faster,  switch to the fucking left lane . Speaking of which... 3) Idiots that drive slowly on the left lane. But they're not as bad as 4) Morons that drive twice the speed limit... On the rightmost lane. Now, this isn't Texas here. There's snow, and ice, and more ice on the roads here in Canadia. I hope they  urlLink slip and impale themselves on a guardrail . 5) Stupid executive bitches on their cellphones in their Acuras and Audis and BMWs (add 1.5 to those too) that cut you off and then slam the brakes.  6) Anyone in a sports SUV.

       Suckage   Well I got the base table done. There was a bit of a problem yesterday with a bug in the indexing routine, but that got fixed.  Now  the problems start - I fond out that the table implementation in FxRuby is quite limited, and that even though I can make a cell  look  like a button, I cannot make it  behave  like one. It can't send click events, nor can it display tooltips. Well, maybe I can try to have it inherit its methods... But I don't know how that will affect the table yet, and I got other things to worry about. Like the three papers I have to finish today. Got one 1/5 done. In the mean time -  urlLink The Exorcist in 30 seconds . With bunnies.

       Photos   Now that my project is happily churning away at numbers, I have some time to post some updates.   First, there's pictures. These are from Thursday, when Prof. Brian Kernighan visited campus. These were taken by the computer science club sysadmin. The gallery is  urlLink here . I show up  urlLink here  (to the right, fat guy with black shirt and coat) and  urlLink here  (on the right again, way in the back at the table). I just have to say that Brian is an awesome guy. Words fail to describe his awesomness. He out-awesomes anyone I've met so far. He's the man. I pity the fool who misses a chance to meet him.   Project: Well, I got it to work. Sort of. Ok, ok, I cheated. I gave up on trying to get the color thing to work, and used the  stipple  method instead. I can select one color for all stipples (LightBlue1 make good color, but any color goes) and then I select different shades of stipples for each cell. Just like they used to do coloring in the 'ol days of monochrome monitors. Ain't that neat? I got a whole 15 shades to work with, plus white.  So, the idea is to build a list of all the files in every version of openssh. Then we create a comma-separated-value (csv) file that has the following:  An empty cell, followed by the list of  all  the files in available for any version of openssh. That we have, it's the list I talked about before.  A line for each version, with the version name, followed by either just a comma if the file is not in that version, or the number of dependencies if the file is in that version.  Do you get a picture now? Basically what I'm creating is a table with the filenames as columns, and the versions as rows. If the file is not present for a file/version combination, the corresponding cell is empty. If it is present, the cell has a number in it, which is the number of dependencies.  What good is this for you ask? Well, let me roll back a bit. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the evolution of openssh, and to point out any architectural instability. Now, the best way to do that by far is visualization. That's where the table comes in. First, it will let the users see how the files are distributed among versions. Second, it will allow me to colorize the cells to indicate file stability - if the dependencies of a file change from one version to another, then that file is unstable. The way to colorize that is to use the lightest shade to start. Every subsequent version that has the file turns the file a shade darker if the dependencies are unchanged, and a shade lighter if they changed. So the darker the cell, the more stable the file.

       Ignore this unless you're a Ruby developer and are eating your own brain out trying to set the color for a singe cell   I just need to write thsi down before the information leaks out of my ears.  Some background: the method  urlLink Fox::FXTable::setCellcolor(  row, col, color )   is weird - it does not let you set the color for a single cell, as one would infer from the name, but for rows and columns of cells only. So there have been several people wondering about this, and I myself am in dire need of that sort of functionality, so I did some inverstigative work to try to figure out if there is some way to do it other than overriding that method. So here's what I found after some rummaging:  I can get the cell in question with  urlLink Fox::FXTable::getItem(  row, col  ) . The cell is an  FXTableItem . I should then be able to set its color with  urlLink Fox::FXTableItem::drawBackground(  table, dc, x, y, w, h  ) . Now I know how to get  table  because it's the parent that the cell is in and that's already defined. I know how to get  h  and  w  (from the  FXTableItem  methods  urlLink getHeight(  table  )  and  urlLink getWidth(  table  ) . I can get  x  and  y  because they're the coordinates of the item in the table, and I would know that beforehand. And I'm pretty sure that  dc  is a  urlLink FXDC   object. But I still need to figure out how to set it up. I'm thinking that I need to be using the  FILL_SOLID  fill style. And the color would probably be a decimal RGB setting, because that's what is used everywhere else on the examples.  ----  Update  Ok, that doesn't work. First,  x  and  y  have to be the actual pixel coordinates. Those I can get with  Fox::FXTable::getColumnX  and  Fox::FXTable::getRowY , but  drawBackground  still craps out on me. I have come to a dead end more or less. Documentation is sparse, so my only hope is that someone on their mailing list/forum qill answer to my pleas. As alternatives, I could fill the cell with an icon (a graphic) but that is sort of crude, or I could use colored text. Neither are really good options.

I mean, I loved it before - after all, I'm pretty much the one that argues that it should replace Java as the language used to teach OOP - but every time I use it I am amazed at how  good  it is at anticipating what I need to do. It is truly the  urlLink pragmatic programmer's  language.

But that's normal - when I have a cold then I feel the worst of it in the morning when I wake up and my throat feels as if I had swallowed a cheese grater.  As for keeping me busy, there's always work. The presentation  urlLink on Tuesday . The presentation on  urlLink Tuesday after that . The  urlLink project  for the same class that those two presentations are for. The  urlLink paper  for the other class. The  urlLink other   urlLink two  papers for the other class.

Ingredients   Chicken  - Because everyone knows that chicken soup is the best for colds. Get something boneless. Chicken breasts do well.   A ginger root  - Show those sinuses what you're made of!   Pepper  - Backup for the ginger. Also gives the soup a nice extra flavor.   Anything else you can think of throwing in a soup  - Pick whatever you want. Good stuff to add are rice, potatoes, carrots. Don't use pasta. The stuff will sit in liquid for a very long time, and the pasta will get all mushy. Hard vegetables are the best. Onions, celery are good to add flavor.   2 laurel leaves  - Two are enough.   Water  - It's water.   A deep frying pan or a wok  The latter preferred. I will use a wok for the instructions, but the frying pan will do just as well. Just make sure it can contain everything.    Preparation  Take the chicken, and cube it into bite-size chunks. Warm up the wok. You will know it's hot enough when you flick in a drop of water and it dances around without evaporating immediately.  If it evaporates right away the wok is too cold!  That is because a really warm surface will create a cushion of vapor under the drop, so the heat doesn't get as far as the water. IF you're using a Teflon-covered or other non-stick surface, then this won't work. You'll just have to use your judgment then. Cook the chicken cubes until they're browned. While those are being done, chop the veggies you have (cubes do well in most cases, carrots can also be cut into thin short strings,  slice the ginger and make them big enough to be fished out later!  Then add a cup or two of water.  Don't run off to get a measuring cup. You will add more water later anyway . Put in all the veggies, the ginger, and the laurel leaves. Add enough water to have it all stewing around. Now, here's why I prefer the wok: You can push everything to the edge and cover it. That way you can steam everything. Anyway, when the veggies are starting to soften up add pepper. More. More. You're not paying attention,  more pepper!  Alright, that's better. See, the idea is to have you actually  taste  something. You can't taste bland soup when you're sick. Cook until all the vegetables are done, and add water as necessary. This is not science, and the amount will vary depending on what you cook. Done! When consuming, don't eat the ginger slices. They're way too strong.    Variations  * Add more water to make the soup more liquid. If you add rice it will need more water anyway, the rice absorbs a lot of it. * Replace chicken for pork or beef for different flavor. But then it's not chicken soup, so I won't guarantee their effectiveness.  * Add spices to enhance the flavor. Preferred are green leafy ones: parsley, cilantro. Dries leaves are good too.  * There was something else but I forgot. Feel free to experiment.

        urlLink [Thou art] a fusty nut with no kernel!    Well it certainly sounds worse than it should be.  My head hurts. I've been putting too much work into this paper. The good thing however is that it will all be over tonight. And then I'm going home and will make myself a good dinner, pork chops and mashed potatoes. With just the right amount of butter and salt. And garlic, can't leave the garlic out.  And with that I leave thee,  Thou surly elf-skinned flap-dragon!

      Well, I did not get the CSGSA position. It was awarded to a 3rd year PhD student, which I guess makes sense. I should have probably applied on the first notice. Oh well, it's my fault for slacking. There will always be future positions available. On the good side, it'll give me time to delve further into my projects. I might even decide to take some of those online courses offered at ACM, since they're free as in beer.  Thinking back on my recent ramblings about driving, I think I know what is wrong - many drivers lack a good amount of courtesy. It doesn't really matter that you know all the rules. It's about having enough common sense to be  nice . On Tuesday I was complaining about this person parked on the middle of the road, just to watch some ducks on the side. Thinking back on it, it wasn't really the car-stopped-on-the-road part that pissed me off - there could have been circumstances that I was not aware of. Perhaps the ducks were crossing, and were by the side of the road at the time that I passed that car. However, the driver could at least have been nice enough to turn on the hazards, instead of just stopping for a long time. The same goes for my ramblings about people hogging the left lane and turning without signals. If you are on the left lane and see someone approaching, you could at the very least move over to let them pass, instead of having everyone stuck behind you.  The Spring term starts on Monday. Wee. Look at me. I'm so excited.  I'm quite dedicated to expanding my software for the evolution view right now. I haven't started with Tk yet (and probably won't for quite a while), but I'm getting better at what I'm doing. And I like it.  A discussion on the Ruby mailing list got me thinking: basically one person was saying that part of what made him become a Ruby user was that the community doesn't flame. All questions to the listserv are answered nicely, and usefully. And I agree with that. Ruby pulled me in for its sensible syntax, but I didn't really get to appreciate its full potential until someone there rewrote my code into a more Ruby-like way. See, back then I was a heavy C/C++ and Perl user, and as a result my syntax was accordingly set. Perhaps the biggest leap for me was when I learned to treat Ruby objects as, well, objects, instead of just arguments. That was when it clicked. I guess that most people that turn to Ruby had the same problem, and as a result  urlLink this tutorial  was created to be presented at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON) this coming July.

      If anyone tried to e-mail me within the last few days, there seems to have been sporadic downtimes on my mail forwarding service, so some of those e-mails may have been dropped. If you e-mailed me and got an  unknown recipient  response (or similar), then please re-send.  Now to the good end: I just love Gmail. It does an awesome job at managing long threaded discussions, and for all I care, the ads can stay. They've non-intrusive, and they're actually relevant. Having said that, I can invite 2 persons to try out the service. So if you are interested, drop me an e-mail, and I'll follow up with the invitation.

      Notice to everyone in duck-infested areas: If there is a pair of ducks  on the side of the road , DO NOT BLOCK THE WHOLE FUCKING ROAD! Damn it people, what the fuck is wrong with you? Ducks are a fucking plague here. Also: if you're moving 2 feet to the side of the road to apparently let a car pass, DON'T MOVE BACK JUST BEFORE THE CAR GETS THERE! YOU FUCKING RETARDS! DIE! DIE! DIE!

      Ok, it just dawned on me that I don't need to give up clickability on my software when transitioning to tk. That is because the code I'm currently using implements its own event handlers, so I can just port that code over to its tk equivalent. Ergo. All I have to worry about then is layout management. I even figured that I can use a single canvas and have all cells painted on it. Sure, it will be close to trying to emulate an FXTable in tk, but at least I will be able to properly document my interfaces (don't get me started on the horror that is FXRuby documentation).  I got the draft in from Jingwei, and it looks pretty good. He did his own implementation in Java (basing the coloring algorithms on mine), but he says that my software is still faster, which I don't doubt. Java is the king of suckiness. Well, maybe the Queen - VB is pretty bad too. Either way, Java's a bitch to work with. But I digress. Jingwei had some neat sorting in his code, in which he sorted the files by earliest appearance instead of alphabetically. I guess that makes sense for what he needs to demonstrate. But what I'm really interested in is the database files he has, because he's not only using my OpenSSH DB, but also some he created himself (or that someone else created for him) for PostgreSQL and GNU/Linux, which are both about 2-3 times as large. I want to get a hand on those to see how fast my code goes with larger databases and if needed improve some of my algorithms. Sure, I can fake a DB, but that's beyond the point.  My advisor sent me an e-mail with the "Future Work" thesis section of one of her previous students, to see if I can use some of it for my own thesis, and lo and behold, quite a lot of it matches my interests. This of course brings up a small dilemma, because I've started to get hooked on this software evolution thing, so I might go careening down a completely different track. Right now I'm thinking of staying away from anything AI-based because I've had very little to do with it as far as courses go, and Software Architecture is one of my strong points anyway, and I've had my fair share of experience in it. Another thing that I may get into is writing up some advanced clustering tools, but I'd have to come up with something that is unique.  One way or another, I need to go to sleep, my brain's been redlining since I woke up and I haven't had that much sugar to start with. If I don't rest then I'm going to burn out soon. So ciao everyone, and remember, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy".

      Alright,  urlLink this is just hilarious .  The weather report says that it's going to rain. Or snow. And it's nearly May. Fucking April weather.  Well, it looks like I may become the CSGSA (Computer Science Graduate Students Association) president. Mind you, that's a  may . But apparently they're desperate for one, so I get a good chance at it. And it comes with a nice paycheck too! I worked a bit more with my software, mainly some color spike/decay alterations, so that the brightness/contrast can be adjusted better. Anyway, that has left me mentally drained, so I'll better take a nap before I become  urlLink dangerous to society .

      While digging through the e-mail that has been accumulating in my inbox these last few days, I came upon one from my TA for Software Architecture. He's working on a paper for color-encoding of software project changes, and wants me to co-author his paper. That will be nice, as I'll get an extra publication in. On the other hand, I've been working on my old project, trying again to enable individual cell coloring. Right now I can use only one color, and it just occurred to me that the cell is using the table's color as a base (which would be bad, because then I couldn't use different colors for different cells). On the other hand I was thinking of taking an entirely different approach and use drawings and/or 3D objects instead, both of which are supported by FXRuby. I've already messed around a bit with drawings, and did a simple  urlLink binary clock  (and a  urlLink funky version ) (both worked for me with the FXRuby supplied by the Windows Ruby 1.8 installer, but they should work even on Linux). Now I should probably write up some classes to make the transition go smooth - something to parse arrays into images comes to my mind. Another advantage is that I won't depend any more on the FXTable class, albeit I'll also lose some of its advantages (clickable cells, etc - I can emulate them, but it'll take quite some effort). On the other hand I  could  (and to make it easier on Jingwei,  should  be using tk instead of Fox, so I might just delay production until I got a hang of tk).

      Boy, does it feel good to just  sleep . Well, that's what I have been doing the last 2 days. Though my bones feel like rubber now. I need to go back and do some good exercise.  On Thursday was the all-day grading madness. Not only did I have to get there by 9 am, but it lasted all day. By the time I was finished my hand was all contorted and twisted on itself.  Fear the claw!  Wednesday was proctoring day. Which means that I had to sit for 3 hours in a quiet room and watch students quiver in fear over the exam. That was fun for a while, but soon got tiring.  Which brings us back to today. I got up early this morning and began making ravioli. With spinach dough and ricotta and Roquefort (that's blue cheese for those who don't know) filling. I  was  going to make another batch of bolognese, but by the time I was done my back ached so much that I hat to lie down and get some rest. Then I got up and began reviewing the application for a professor's ADDS status.  I also noticed that as a  urlLink Blogger  user I get to beta-test  urlLink Gmail . If I like the service I will probably end up migrating my Netscape mail over to that one. Despite all the hype about the privacy concerns of Gmail, I don't think it's any worse than other web-based e-mail offerings. Having said that, my address is docboobenstein  at  gmail.com . And before anyone asks, no, my ACM address is still the main one. The Netscape one was just used for mailing lists and whatnot, and the Gmail one will serve the exact same purpose.

      Well, the financial part got mostly sorted out, so I can breathe for now. That's the good news. The bad news is that tomorrow I have to proctor a final, and then the day after I'll probably spend all afternoon grading. Until then, I'm going to take a good nap. And read more of that fantabulastically entertaining book I've been rambling about yesterday. And nap some more. Maybe eat something. Oh, you're still there? I'm done. You can stop reading. I mean it. Stop. Reading. You just won't stop, will you? That's it, I'm pulling the plug. Seriously. I will. You just watch me.

       Khaaaan!   Well, there's been a lot of things happening over the weekend. On the one hand, I applied for a position as a sessional teacher for one of the intro courses at UWaterloo. Which I hope I get, because I could really use that extra money, what with the next semester rolling up and tuition fees not getting any cheaper. If not I'm probably going to have to look for a second job. Yay. I'm trembling with excitement.  Then there's the work I'm doing towards my Thesis. I know it's probably too soon to even worry about it, but I want to get an early start and get some work done before I run into more deadlines along the road.  This whole being-the-tech-support-guy-for-the-whole-family is getting a bit on my nerves. I think I may start charging for that... I fix their computer, they buy me dinner. Or some shit like that.  I'm fascinated with  Quicksilver . Unlike  Cryptonomicon  (which was still an excellent book) this one got me hooked from page 1. No, wait, that's a lie. It was page 3. The only complaint that I have is that it's not going very easy on my back. I'm going to have to acquire a backpack where I can fit both the laptop and the book, plus some other things. Got to keep an eye on my health after all.

       Last night I looked out of the window...   ...And what did I see?  Snow . Fucking snow. For those of you that claim that Canadia isn't a block of ice all year long:  It fucking feels like it is . Now, let me set this clear - I don't mind the cold. I don't even mind the humidity (if I did, I'd have left Corpus Christi after a month). I mind the  wind and the snow . The wind, because it gets between your clothes and makes the cold unbearable. The snow because I have to scrape it off the fucking windshield every morning. Which is a bad thing if you leave your gloves in the car. Well, on the good side, my DPs are nice and cold.  I got the judge's comments back from my presentation for the conference 2 weeks ago. They were pretty much as expected - raving on the delivery part, good on the content part. Although one of them miscounted. Not that it would matter I think. I kind of expected them to complain a bit about the lack of content - basically one of the reasons was that it wasn't as much research as the results from the work we had been doing at HpCDC. That, and the fact that I wanted to prove to this one grad student that you  can  do a presentation about how something  doesn't  work and get away with is. And I did. Because you can. And like the last time I used it, they loved my penguin analogy.  This morning I got an e-mail from the CSCF (Computer Science Computing Facility) saying that they were working on my PC for my cubicle, and that deserves a big cheer, because I hate the terminals. Can't even get a decent curses-based UI to work. So basically they were asking me about details for the installation. I figured that I'd want to keep it exclusively for work, and restrict gaming to my laptop, so I asked them to install Debian on it. Of course if the hardware is nice enough I might be persuaded to throw Q3A on it, hehe. And the other good thing is that depending on the setup I might even be able to use it as a gateway for the laptop, and then I'll be able to apt-get from there as well. And if I can't, then I will at least be able to use it as an apt cache. Either way, it's a win-win situation.

       Your dog wants steak...   Well, Easter weekend was rather busy for me. Aside from the one thing I'm doing (which I won't give details about because I promised so) which is taking up a lot of my time I received a few news, and some deadlines are creeping up on me. So let's go straight to the bullets that don't kill:  * I've gotten a position as a graduate student on the Representative Council at UW. It'll mean that I'll be busier starting May 1st, but it will also mean that I get a chance at having some impact on what happens around here.   * Wednesday is the due date for the paper for  The 6th Workshop on High Performance Scientific and Engineering Computing (HPSEC-04) , which means that tomorrow I'll probably spend a lot of time working on that with Evan.   * Naruto does indeed kick ass. And this episode is the one that catches up with the manga while I was reading it, so anything to come will be new to me. Which is good for me, because I like suspense, and good for you, because I'll stop saying  "I told you so"  and being a total piss about it.   *  Shura no Toki  looks like a promising series. At first glance it's another one of those  "Oh, look, samurais and ninjas and whatnot and the main character is a badass of course and so is the other guy and so is the third. Anything new?"  type of series, and it probably is, but I'm interested nevertheless. Which is more than I can say about  Bakuretsu Tenshi , which is so cliche-ridden that it's not funny anymore. And I only saw the first episode. Plus I don't think that rollerskating mechas should be allowed. Beshaba's buttocks, you could at least take a clue from so many other mecha series and use some nifty hover action instead. And some may think I'm crazy for saying this, but boobies just for fan service's sake are not good. Yes Virginia, I just said that boobies are indeed not always good.   * If my relationship with my family is any indicator, then the less time I spend with anyone the better I get along. Which probably explains why I get along so well with my stepbrothers and -sisters.   * On that account of news, Brenda (my stepsister) is having another baby. And so is Kim (my stepsister in law... Or to make it easier, my stepbrother's wife. There, that wasn't so tough, was it?) One is due around May 6, the other early June.  Alright, I'm going to go back to do my whatnots.  Oh, for last words: Creed sucks.

       Fixination   Well, the cluster got fixed. Which is good. But the event made me think, and I need to come up with some tools for such contingencies. One thing I want to make is a rescue disc for the cluster - a live-CD version running our own kernel. Also including a Server one. That way, if something bad happens, we can always drop in a CD in each fucker and they'd be up again. Not to mention that we could eventually add more machines without needing to install shit on their drives.  The other thing I'd like to try is a nfsboot kernel. I know Evan is against it, and I was too in the beginning, but the kernel only gets loaded on boot, and the rest is local. That will make it easier to roll out new kernels.  I spent all afternoon at my stepsister's, setting up my old computer for her - and failed miserably. The motherboard blew a cap (and I noticed that several others had started to leak - probably due to long exposure to the saline atmosphere in CC). So I ended up taking the burner and the TV card out of that machine and putting it in the other one. She also got my speakers. They're no Klipsch Promedia, but they're definitively better than the crappy desktop ones she had before. At least these have a subwoofer. The sound card of course didn't work. Y'see, the card is a SoundBlaster Live!, and this card is known for fucking up when on machines with Athlon motherboards and running Windows 2000/XP. So she still got that onboard crap going. The one thing that I took out for myself is the hard drive. Now, I know that certain people hate Quantum Fireball HDs, but this fucker survived trips all over the place - I had originally bought it in Buenos Aires, way before I moved to TX, and it still keeps on kicking. So I'm going to put that one on my mom's computer, and use it to store my backups. Or maybe I'll throw Linux on it, and make the machine dual-boot. Not as if she'll ever notice. I also started working on my proposal for a graduate project. I want to work on interaction of AI agents in an environment that is not regulated (e.g. where input data is not verified to be true). But to do that I first need an engine that can handle tainted information, and make decisions about the "truthness" of statements based on what it knows. So I'm looking for an AI system that can do that. If there isn't any, then I'll have to write one, and that will become my Master's thesis, and the social AI thing will go for the PhD.

       Ah, the power of bad scripting   So, I messed up the cluster. Badly. With one fell swoop, caused by a script with a typo, I crippled all but one machine on the cluster by overwriting the shadow password files. Well, it's fixable. All that needs to be done is take the hard drives out of the other machines, mount them on the one good one (good thing that they're hot-swappable too) and replace the shadow file. What ticks me off is that I could fix it myself if I was there. But I'm not. So I can't. Which sucks. Big time. Through a rubber hose.  Well, on the good side of things, I found  urlLink this  neat origami site. And a good  urlLink quiz  to keep the moods up.

       What a trip!   I just got back from Kingston to Waterloo, and the usually boring drive was a whole new adventure today. It just happens that the first 100 km or so (~70 miles for those not used to the metric system) of the way were covered with black ice. Yep, even the 401 (the 400 series of highways in Ontario are the equivalent of interstates in the U.S.). Take a map of Ontario, follow the 401 from Kingston to Cobourg - that's the stretch. All because of freezing rain. You know it's getting bad when you pass under a bridge and the tail of your car gets sideswept because of the wind. I saw nearly a dozen accidents during that stretch, even a fresh double one where a black Mustang ended in the ditch on the left and a white F-100 on the right. That makes it about one accident every 10 km. I bet the police must be happy... Not! But the road got much better after that, once I got into the dry Toronto area everything was a blitz. And since I was following the flow that meant that I was doing an average of 130 kph on that part, even through downtown Toronto, so I made it home about 1/2 hour faster than usual.  And before I forget, let me reiterate my utter hatred for those that cruise on the left lane.  Specially those that cruise at 90 kph in a 100 kph zone. I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate those fucktards, may their erogenous zones be infested with the fleas of a thousand camels!  Whew, I feel better now.  Now to one thing I forgot on the last update: A little while ago Richard indicated on  urlLink his blog  that he had started Dungeon Siege, and I just wanted to agree with his statement that this game requires absolutely no mental activity. It's really  Diablo Light . There is no way to stray from the right path (since there is only one way to go) and one doesn't even have to worry about elemental strengths/weaknesses like in Diablo. Whether you hit an Ice Warrior with a fireball or an Ice Bolt doesn't matter, you will always do the same damage (for equal-strength spells, that is). Having said that, I got recently interested in Temple of Elemental Evil - It's supposed to be the most D&D - faithful game available. I might give it a try, if the specs on my laptop allow it.

       I'm not dead   Nope, not at all. I was just very busy these past few weeks, what with the semester finishing and the graduate research symposium coming up. Well, I'm glad to announce that pretty much most of it is over. The symposium definitively, and the classes almost.  Most of it is boring, so I'll spare everyone the task of having to read it. But I  will  give you some bullet-list updates:  * There was this one guy at the Q&A during my presentation that completely dissed my results and went on with some highly questionable ramblings, and ran (literally) out of the room once he was finished. The judges still liked my presentation despite of that, so that's ok.   * I am giving my old computer to my stepsister for her kids to play with. It barely survived the shipping anyway, so I figured that if her kid's computer is going to get messed up anyway, it better be one that has already survived all types of ordeals. I'll miss having a decent graphics card (the laptop I'm currently using has a crappy Intel one), but once I rake up enough money for my own laptop I'm getting something decent.   *Raspberry sherbet! Good stuff.   * iPod -I finally got to the point where I filled it up. I'll probably go back and re-encode my CD's to a lower bitrate (960192 vbr is quite large).   * Camera -I finally borrowed a decent digital one, so I'll be taking pictures here and there in the next few days and will maybe post them here.

      SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT SHI TITTY  (mmm... boobies) SHIT FUCK THE FUCKING FUCKER FUCK FUCK FUCK DAMNIT FUCK SHIT FUCK.  I spent the entire  fucking week  chewing on the fucking problem from last week's assignment (needless to say that what I turned in was pure bullshit) and now that I forget about it for a night and glance at it the fucker clicks. I was approaching it from the wrong fucking direction! So here was the problem: I was to prove, using the Recursion Tree method that  T(n) = T(n/3) + T(n/2) + Theta(1)  was  O(n) . Now I spent a lot of time banging my head against the wall trying to work out the sloppy cost of the leafs nodes, but I just realized that  I didn't fucking need to!  He had already given me the answer with the problem, and all I needed to do was to plug  O(n)  into  T(n)  and prove that  T(n)  . Which is a much,  much  easier thing to do.

      Just thought I'd post a bit of an update on recent happenings with friends...   urlLink Richard  moved to VA. Layla is currently following on his heels. So good luck Mr. Richmeister on your new job, and a safe trip to Layla.   Brooke is getting married to Aaron. No date set, but they're planning for next spring.   John Piccarazzi is also getting married. In fall.  Shabnam got her Master's, and has moved to the ECE department for her Ph.D.  Well, that's it for concrete news. And since I don't like spreading rumors, I'll stop there.

      Few things feel quite as rewarding as spotting that asshat that was doing 140+ kph on the right lane getting pulled over by a cop. Among those few things is driving down the 401 through Toronto, with signs everywhere yelling  "We got cops out on the road! Don't speed!" , and still seeing people pass you at exorbitant speeds on the right lane only to get pulled over by  -gasp-  a cop! Well, at least it wasn't a  urlLink møøse .    Update :  urlLink This article  explains why there were so many pigs on the loose.

      The other day I was walking home from school. Nothing cute about that. But the road I take goes by a pond/lake thing by the university fields, and that day there were two families of geese there. It's fenced off, but the mother geese were still mightily angry that someone would have the balls to walk 2 meters from their chicks and were hissing to the left and to the right. And that was the day that I'd left my camera at home. But I'll take it next time - hopefully they're still there and I'll get a good shot.

      I was initially against getting my parent's suggestions to get a bike. After all, I'm just a relatively short (~30 minutes) walk away from school, and it's good exercise. But I recently found some really nice areas in the vincinity, and taking a bike trip through the countryside looks more and more promising each time. I could do that in the car, but   I want the exercise and.  The car deserves a rest.  I've been looking at prices, and what's surprising me the most is that there's few places left that will sell you just a fucking plain bike. They constantly have to add 18+ gears, weird-ass frame designs, and whatnot. Mind you, I'm not 100% against gears - going uphill can be tough - but 3 is more than enough. If you're going up a hill that would justify the 18 gears then you're probably better off by getting off the bike and pushing it anyway.  Having said that, I had hoped for a nice sunny day to go off picnicking in the hills, but it seems that wish wasn't granted to me. So I'll do homework instead (or at least pretend I do it by thinking about the assignments every hour or two).

      Yesterday I had to drive to Toronto to attempt to fix my dad's laptop (which ended up not needing fixing). Now, I left a bit early, and halfway there I realized that I'd be 1/2 hour early. I didn't want to wait for that long so I was pondering what to do. By then I was approaching Halton Hills, which cradles the 401 and offered a really nice view every time I passed. I had also recently spotted a lake in the vincinity, and it all looked gorgeous with lush green fields and all. So I took a detour. Boy, was I happy I did! It's an absolutely exhilarating drive. The uphill is nice, but the downhill is where it really shines - it's practically a mountain pass, snaking down from the top. And for the time it lasted, it really made me forget about all the other crap going on these days (which I won't talk about - I want to keep the blogosphere nice and happy).  I didn't get a chance to visit the lake, but I'm thinking of going this weekend for a leisurely evening of nice driving and perhaps even a picnic. Yeah, that's something I haven't done in a while, which is really a shame, because there's lots of great places for that in the area.  Damn, all this food talk made me hungry. And wanting a beer. A  urlLink Grasshopper  to be precise.

The Human Equation  is one of those discs that make you want to immediately run off to the store and buy it. Which means that it's on my wishlist now.

      A recent visitor on the Ruby mailing list (who seems to me had a C/C++ background) asked why in Ruby zero was not false. This sparked some comments, but as of the time of me reading it no one had considered Ruby's ancestry. Ruby borrows many good concepts from languages all over the board. That was done on purpose, and done very well I would say. Two languages that heavily influenced Ruby were Smalltalk and Scheme. Now, one Scheme had the following idea: Everything is true except  false . More on this later, but first to C, where zero  is  true: I recall Dr. Michaud talking about why zero was a convenient  false  in C (well, he didn't say exactly that, but went on about a nice talk on why there is no "bit" type in C, and that can be applied here) - this is because zero is an integer, and integers can be nicely fit into a byte/word. Boolean true/false values on the other hand would need only a bit, but would need a byte/word to be allocated anyway. This is a huge waste of allocation space, which not so long ago was a quite precious resource. Plus, integers can do all these nifty things, like addition, substraction, factorial, and so on and so forth. Since zero is the nicest non-positive integer, it makes just sense to use it as false. It also takes the least effort to represent, so it's better at being false than a negative number, and doesn't encompass an entire range.  Now back to Ruby. In Ruby, integers are just another subtype of objects. And why should an object, something that has been given metadata, be considered false? It doesn't make sense. Effectively, this makes everything except  false  true. But there's more! In Ruby, as in Scheme,  nil  is also false. This follows directly from the previous definition of false, because  nil  is not something, and therefore does not belong to everything.  And that is the story on why only  false  and  nil  are false in Ruby.

      Fine, you can tell me that it's important because it proves that Insertion Sort is crappier than Merge Sort. I got that. But what's the fucking point in trying to prove it over and over again in a myriad of new and painfully tortuous ways? It's not practical, I'm not going to spend 2 hours trying to come up with the efficiency of the code that I spent 30 minutes on. Neither am I going to go and code my own sorting algorithms - That's what libraries are for.  But what really,  really  pisses me off is the fucking textbook. They use the worst fucking notation I've ever seen in a book, and I've seen a lot of pretty shitty stuff. For example,    they use  lg n  as a shortcut of  log2 n . Now I don't know how that goes hereabouts, but I was raised to know that  lg n  is a shortcut for  log10 n , and  log10 n  only.   They show some pseudocode, and only show the pseudocode conventions two pages afer that.   They use some weird-ass signs to signify comments and assignments that no-one used before, because they're not standard ASCII characters. And then they claim that they're using notation common to languages like Pascal, C, and Java. Fuckign liars.  They change the meaning of notations. When could you ever see a notation that uses  f[x]  to say that  f  is a field of the  x  object? Only in this shitty book. Everyone sensible would wather use something like  x->f , so as to prevent confusion with the array notation.   The book tries to use buzz-words, but ends up fucking up horribly. They even try to describe a  von Neumann  architecture as a, get a load of this,   generic one-processor, random access machine (RAM) model  . I was confused. Was this a fuckign joke? Or were they really that stupid? Sure, random access machines are not made up, but they just shouldn't throw the word out and then make up their own shitty definition.  And this is a book from the MIT press. What has the world come to? Eh, fuck it all.

      ... Is  deskullination , brought to you by  urlLink Something Awful  and the letter  42 .  Summer is here. I'm amazed how the weather transitioned from sub-zero-freezing-my-ass-off-fucking-cold to sweaty-balls-hot in more or less a month. Well, at least the rains cool things down, but the problem is of course that after the rain comes the humid heat and the dreaded bloodsuckers.  Next week is the start of the soccer league here. Just like at TAMU-CC, the Computer Science team is the crappy skill/good standing one. Unlike TAMU-CC, these games are outdoors, something I'm quite looking forward to because that means we can slide *grins*. Of course with the amount of exercise I've been getting lately I'll more likely roll than slide.  Mom seems to be getting along pretty well with Linux. She doesn't use the computer much for anything apart from e-mail and word processing, and she manages pretty well with Firefox and OpenOffice. So it seems unlikely that I'll be installing Windows back on that machine any time soon. Now the only problem is to get my iPod running on Linux, so that I can upload my music. Before I had been using xPlay, which is a quite decent software for what it does, except that it sometimes forgets to update the song index so I'm stuck with the old one until I re-update.  The iPod should be recognized when plugged in, or at least when the modules are loaded. I don't think there's a problem there. Last time I tried I failed to mount it though, but now I know that it's because I was trying to mount  /sda , which is the zip drive (see, even that one works on bootup). So I'm guessing that I have to look at  /sdb , or some other drive. Eh, I'll probably check online.  While on the topic of Linux, I need to find my Q3A CD so I can install it at work. What? It's for, um, research. Yeah. Um. I'm, err, doing some software architecture thingjamabob with it. Yeah, that's it. I'm not slacking off. Not at all.

      Ok, I fixed the color part... Mostly. After some important changes (including an ugly bug that had crept in and had me banging my head against the table for a good hour or two) I can now use more than one color base. Well, mostly. There's only one problem because by using two color bases they taint each other, so instead of yellow (for red + green) you get a dirty yellow. Which would be acceptable except that the initial spikes are not tainted, and thus stick out. It's probably just a matter of figuring out how they interact, but right now the official stance in my documentation is "use just one color, I'm not responsible for anything else". For the moment I'm stuck waiting for a response on the  connect()  method implementation. I figure that I'll spend the waiting time looking at Jingwei's code and importing some of his program's features, specially the importer for his databases.  Or  I could just go ahead and work on the sorting algorithm. Hmm, yes, that sounds like a better idea.

      I've been improving my program to customize the colors. I still need to change a few things, but I'm hoping that soon it'll be able to individually set any of the RGB base colors,or any combination thereof. I've added methods for Red, Blue, and Green color scales, but they don't work together yet, because they're still mostly based on the old archaic code. Eventually I'll fix that though... I hope. And I also need to change the coloring methods to determine the color that needs to be darkened based on the color that the cell owns. The problem with that though is that if one cell has a blue base color and the next a red base color, then it will change the blue color on a red scale, and that is just asking to be shot in the foot and having the leg blown off while you're at it. No, I need to have the class get a base color, and use that to override the cell colors. That shouldn't be all too difficult... Most of the architecture already works with such changes in mind, and all that needs to be changed is the target from which the base color is extracted, and that's just a one-liner.  Setting up the events handlers is a bit of a pain though... The API is not clear on how that works, and the modules that I included that should have fixed that didn't... So I'll probably go back to my trusty source of the FXRuby mailing list and pester them until someone gives me an answer.  OT: Someone brought to my attention that the comments section required a Blogger account to post. That has been fixed, or so I hope.

      Well, following on the steps of a major update on  urlLink Blogger  I decided to try some of them new templates here. Things are going to be changing around, until I settle on something I like. There's definitively room for improvement here.   Update: Well, I fixed a few things here and there:    The links are back.  I got comments enabled now, so I'm scrapping the tag-board. It was difficult to follow conversations with that anyway.  I tried resizing the columns, but the template uses images to round off the corners. Unless I edit the images, it would fuck everything up. So until I change that, the width will remain as it is. I got an idea on how to set the corners to resize dynamically, but it's too much fucking work for just a blog, so I'm leaving it as it is.  Colors are fixed now. The previous template looked fine on my monitor, but on other systems the sidebar colors did not match the background color as they were supposed to.   I learned to use fantabulastic bullet-lists now.  I switched over to actually using the title field for post titles. Before I'd do it by hand because the title formatting on the old template was crappy. But now the titles are used on the new template for the archives. I switched the last month or so worth of archives, everything else is still in the old format.   Anyway, here's  urlLink something to break y'all's heads .

      ... And a shitload of rain. That's what I got myself into last night driving back home. I could see it when I was passing Toronto: A rolling black mass closing in from the Southeast, over the lake. Half an hour after that the show began. Lightning lit the sky, and at that moment I really wished I had a camcorder because it was fucking beautiful. Lightning was striking just a few hundred feet from the highway. Well, it was nice while it lasted. Then came the rain. Which felt pretty much as if someone had dumped the contents of a bathtub over my windshield, all at once.  Then today the sun was shining. With all the humidity and the mosquitoes coming out, it felt just like being back in Texas. Except that there's actual trees around here.  Green  trees. But then on the way back I looked West, and there came the rain clouds again. I got home about 5 minutes before the rain started, and let me tell you, it reminded me of the summer rains back in Buenos Aires. Still air, temperatures rising because of all the heat being pushed forward by the rain, then a nice breeze picks up, and then splash, and the temperature drops to a nice cool level. And the smell... I love that irony, electric smell.  I'm doing some progress with the software evolution program. I had scrapped the table in favor of a canvas, which is much,  much  faster, and had stumbled upon the problem of scrolling the window. Finally somebody helped me and now I can resize the window and scroll it. Next step is adding rules to implement the  connect  methods, so that I can launch events on click/keypress. Then I need to revise the coloring rules to make them more dynamic (it currently only uses one color, and the color spike/decay rules are hardcoded). Then I'll look into Jingwei's code, because he uses a different source format and I want to add an option to use that instead (with my csv option as the default). I also want to look at the code he uses for his zoomable views. I wonder whether he he uses SVG graphics for that. Fortunately I don't have to do much to re-implement my color contrast/brightness modules, since all that needed to be done change the spike/decay values, and everything else is already implemented.  But before I do any of that I need to review the latest draft of the workshop paper, and before I do that, I need to get working on the homework for tomorrow.

      I wish more people would pay attention to that. It'd save techies like me a lot of trouble. But ohh no, they had to go with the cheap solution. And now my parents will have to get used to using Linux, because I am not going to put Windows on  my  hard drive, which I bought over 7 years ago, and still works like a charm. It's a good old pre-suckinness-era Quantum. Go me! Well, I  was  thinking about installing that  Ignalum  distro I heard about today on Slashdot, but in the end I figured that I'll stick with good ol' Debian based stuff, and have my parents use OpenOffice, Firefox, and Thunderbird instead of MSOffice, IE, and Outlook. And if they fuck something up, I can give instructions to them over the phone to set up port forwarding on the router to give me ssh access and then I can fix it remotely. Ain't  that  nice? Anyway, I'm going to bed now. I've been driving for 5+ hours... Today I took a big turn around Toronto instead of having to deal with the traffic downtown. The good thing is that it took me about the same time, and I saw some lovely landscapes. The bad thing is that I put an extra 5 miles or so on my route. Well, it's still better than stop-n-go traffic. And the amount of rolling hills brought forth a good number of  WEEEE!  and  WOOOO!  moments.

      I've been away from math for too long. I completely forgot how to prove by induction... I'm supposed to prove that the inequality  n   is true for all positive integers... And am stuck. I remember part of the thing... Such as starting out with the truth  for n=1 P(n)=2 , and that the recursive expression  P(k+1)=2*P(k)  somehow gets into that... But after that my brain just slips off the clutch and careens down a cliff and there's blood everywhere, and the baby's crying, and the cop is standing at the top of the cliff shaking his head and saying "boy, what a mess".  Help?  I  know  that  n  , I just don't fucking remember how to prove it nicely.  Classes started this week. I'm definitively sticking with the Meta Programming Languages one (which gives me a  good  chance to use Ruby), and of course I have to take the Algorithms class... Distributed Networking sucks big donkey balls, so I'm out of that one, and I probably won't take the AI one for credit (but I will go to it anyway just to learn the shit once and for all), which should give me a fairly balanced schedule overall. Well, until I start working for my TA assignment. Which apparently is a lot of work this semester. One way or another, my weekdays start very early and end very late. My typical day this week has been   * get up at 6-7am  * Go to the office, work on papers/projects  * Go to class  * Go to meetings  * Go to class  * Work more on my papers/projects  * Drag myself home (usually it's 6-7pm by then)  * Have dinner  * Sleep till morning Needless to say, a 12-hour workday has not been too nice on me, and I'm feeling drained. Today was the firsts day where I slept until after 9am, and that was because I forced myself to stay in bed. Early classes aren't helping that much either... My parent's PC broke down again... From their description of the problem it sounds like the disk where I had LILO installed is kapputt... I'm hoping that's not the case, and that it's just a problem of a bad connection. In any case I hope to create a  urlLink BartPE  CD for them in case this happens again. With that at least they'll have something to get their PC working. It will also be nice in case it gets hit with a virus. Well, as a result of all that they suckered me into going to visit them this weekend. I don't mind doing it every once in a while, but I already went last weekend, and gas isn't free... Plus it's 4 hours (per one-way trip) out of my life that I won't get back. Not that I have that much of a life anyway... Damn.  But while on the topic of PCs, I got a decent one in at work earlier this week. With Debian installed as requested. So I spent a good time  urlLink customizing it to my liking  (those are icons from the BeOS theme) and getting things to work that should have been working already, including (but not limited to):  * Killing  esd  when I log in (it blocks  /dev/dsp , which is used to play sounds)  * Setting the ssh daemon to start on bootup (was disabled, tsk tsk tsk) so I can log in from home  * Changing the hostname ( daedalus  is so much nicer on my command line prompt than  csgradpc11 )  * Installing the fortunes. Got to have the fortunes! There are some things that I should have requested earlier... Such as reiserfs instead of ext3... But all in all the person did a good job. And he used aptitude, which made me happy when I wanted to go install it and found it already on the system. He's got a lot to learn however - the job used to be done by someone else, and the new person doesn't know much about maintaining a large number of machines. He didn't know how to install a second root account (even minimalistic ones like  sash ), doesn't know that he could get root access anyway with a LiveCD, and most importantly  he was installing the machines one by one . Now for small systems like HpCDC this may be ok, because there are only 12 machines and the specs don't change from one machine to another... But for a larger environment he should at least have used some cloning tool, such as  systemimager .  Back to my PC - there are things that I still need to get working. I need to check with them to see how their policy is on me adding my own hardware (I want a firewire card for my iPod). And I want to set up the USB connection for my camera so I can upload pictures from it.

      I think I should go home now. Time flies when programming. Good thing that there's no coffee to be had at the university at this time of the day, or I'd be up all night.  When I go home I'll probably crash the bed (no, I'm not  driving  it), so good night folks.

      One of the assignments due soon require me to write some program in C, C++, or Java. Now, the problem is that I haven't seriously used any of those for a year and a half or so (though it feels like more than that). I never  needed  to. So I'm pretty rusty on any of those.  Java is, in any case, out of the question. I abhor the language. That leaves me with a choice between C and C++. Today I've started writing the base of my program - a linked list - in C. Which would have been ok, except that I've been spoiled by proper O-O languages (read:  urlLink Ruby ), and my brain now refuses to think in a procedural way. It would be very easy to write this program if I make some assumptions and use a few global variables, but I just can't. It feels  wrong . So I'll end up writing the whole thing in C++. Now the problem I foresee is that all my C++ experience is pre-gcc3.x. So I'm not used to the slight new variations, such as having to use  namespace std  or using  &lt cstdio &gt  instead of  &lt stdio.h &gt  and whatnot. Which shouldn't be too much of a problem in itself, but it's a nag.  On the good side, I have the good fortune of having brought along with me the book I used in Data Structures at TAMU-CC, and that has pretty much all the definitions of data structures I need. So I'm going to drag it out of the drawer at work where it's collecting dust and put it to good use.

      I had been thinking about it for some while, but the  urlLink recent article  on bOING bOING pretty much set my mind to it. There is something missing in bayesian filters, and that is a way to tag certain words as filter-unworthy. For example, if a mailing list gets spammed, certain words, such as the mailing list name and address, should not be trusted... but that doesn't mean that any other e-mail on that list should be tagged as spam, when the proportion is perhaps one in 5000. So there would be two ways to solve this - to put more weight on all the spam-related words, or to reduce the weight on the unreliable words. Hmm... perhaps that would warrant a little project.

      ... But I won't have any because I don't have anyone to drink  with  and drinking alone is just not right.  Anyway, the situation with dad is as follows: He's throwing the whole  "Oh I'm dying, I'm so depressed, nobody loves me"  act. There's more to that, but I'll stop there. And he's done it before I'm told. So after going today to see what the whole situation is I've come to the conclusion that I'd better put some distance between myself and the whole shit. I don't drag  them  into my problems, so I don't want them to drag  me  into theirs. And my stepbrothers and sisters pretty much agree there. I did a last thing out of pure nicety which was to bring everyone else in the family who has a fucking life up to date, but things are stopping there. I can't afford to sacrifice half my day for this shit, and contrary to the beliefs of some people, I do have a life, and a pretty busy one on top of that.  As for dad's health situation, it seems to be either a pulmonar infection or a heart condition (or possibly both or one that cascaded into the other). However, it's nothing that should be a problem if takes care of himself. Which is the tough part, because he's a stubborn bastard. But whatever happens I'm staying out of it.  Now, there is still part of the evening left, the sun is shining, and I intend to enjoy it and  The Confusion . And I will let nothing short of bad weather or an alien abduction ruin that.

      My dad got in from a trip a few days ago, but he's staying at St. Michaels hospital in Toronto. Apparently he had a severe heart failure, and it is likely that he will need to be operated. Which by itself isn't so worrisome, but the bad thing is that it comes chained with quite a few other health conditions.  Eh, one way or another there is nothing that will be fixed by worrying, and those who know me are well aware that I tend to be a no worries person.  So to brighten things up I will say that I finished  Quicksilver  yesterday, and am merrily looking forward to inflicting it upon my stepbrother. He was looking for historical fiction, and has never had a taste of Neal Stephenson (literary-wise, you pervert!), so I thought to drop the book by his house when on the way to the hospital to visit my father. And while I'm at it I might as well go grab  The Confusion .

      Alright I admit it, it's more like rain and more rain. No matter how many times I experience them, thunderstorm have this certain uniqueness to them. One moment you're driving down a dry highway, the next moment it's water splashing all over and everyone that has some brain in them is crawling along at half speed with the hazards on. Notice that everyone with some brain, because there's always some stupid asshats that end up killing themselves. Like the one I passed by. All 3 westbound lanes were closed, and fortunately the accident happened by an exit so we could get around. The suicide fucktard was driving a Corvette. I know that because I saw the car's tail, which is about the only piece that was left of it. The cab was crushed, and the engine was shredded to bits. From the looks of it the guy was going too fast, lost control, and ended up under the wheels of the 18-wheeler that was parked diagonally across the highway. I'd feel sorry for the guy (or gal), except that he/she probably had it coming. So it serves him/her right. I do feel sorry however for the trucker.

      Shut down the internet, thrash your computer, because as of 5 minutes ago I stopped caring. You go out of your fucking way to make things fucking  easy  for them, and all you get is "Why doesn't this work like it used to". And when you try to explain them that it's because the system they're using right now is different from what they were using 5 years ago all you get is deaf ears and a dumb stare. From now on, I will stop trying to set things up like they want to and begin doing it like they should have it, and if they don't like it, then they can stick it where the sun don't shine, because I will not waste my time on unappreciated work.

      Excellent, excellent! Contents follow.  -----  Good news, we got the paper in.   -jingwei  Thank you for your submission to IWPSE 2004. We are happy to inform you that your paper,  Evolution Spectrographs: Visualizing Punctuated Change in Software Evolution  has been accepted as FULL TECHNICAL PAPER to be included in the proceedings of the technical program. This year we received 27 paper submissions with a large portion of good papers among them. The competition was high and only 17 papers were finally accepted.  We enclose a set of reviews of your paper. Please make sure that in your preparation of the final paper you incorporate the suggestions of the reviewers.  You will receive an author kit from IEEE in the next couple of days. The page limit for full technical papers is 10 (TEN PAGES). Please note that the deadline for the camera-ready paper is June 28.  We look forward to seeing you this September in Kyoto.  Best regards, Harald Gall and Tsuneo Ajisaka IWPSE 2004 PC Co-Chairs                -~-~-~-~-~-~ start of review data ~-~-~-~-~-~-    Reviewer 1     Detailed evaluation:   Originality 4-high  Novelty 3-average  Evaluation 4-high  RelatedWork 3-average  Quality 4-high  ProblemFixing 3-average  JournalConsideration 3-average   Summary:   The paper studies the punctuation aspects of the evolution of sw systems. Punctuations are suddent and discontinuous changes in the evolution. The authors study the evolution of three open source systems with the help of the evolution spectographs and show cases of sudden changes in the system evolution.   Positive aspects:   very readable paper  empirical evidence with three case studies  spectographs reveal the eveolution of the system   Negative aspects:   changes may appaer as punctuaction because a large set of files have been committed in the repository at once. So, the evolution contain sudden changes that may be the result of a long and slow change process. Only at the moment of commit they become visile. The authors note this fact in the linux kernerl case study (page 8, sec 4.3). The question is: are all the major changes detected as punctuation or are there major changes in the system that are not visible as sudden changes ? The authors should bring evidence for the second case too. This should clarify what this technique can do and what cannot do.  Good approach for documenting the past but the developers already knew about these sudden changes. It's not clear what added value they can bring to the development or maintenance process. It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate more on this point.   Detailed comments:   Related work is good but the authors should clarify the contribution of the paper wrt the related work  Page 8 line 10, should be "outgoing" instead of "incoming"?                 -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~--~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-   Reviewer 2     Detailed evaluation:   Originality 3-average  Novelty 2-low  Evaluation 2-low  elatedWork 3-average  Quality 4-high  ProblemFixing 2-low  JournalConsideration 2-low  Summary:   A new visualization technique, called evolution spectrographs, is especially suitable for highlighting "punctuated" change---that is, a change that affects multiple components at the same time.   Positive aspects:   novel visualization technique  technique shows that evolution sometimes undergoes rapid changes   Negative aspects:   Who believes that software evolution is a continuous process?  Benefits of spectrographs (over other visualization techniques, or no visualization at all) not clear   Detailed comments:   My main concern with this paper starts at the first sentence: "It is commonly believed that software evolution is a slow process of incremental change."  Is this so?  I do not believe in slow incremental changes - in fact, I am well aware of big changes, such as integration of merges, before a final release, and therefore challenge the authors to provide claims for this statement - otherwise the first result of this paper, namely that software evolution is punctuated, becomes a non-result.  My second concern is that the individual punctuations should be qualitatively evaluated.  It may well be that global changes to source code, such as version bumps, license changes, or integration of meres, induce a punctuation without any effect on the actual executable. Please discuss.  I liked the spectrograph metaphor as a visualization that highlights punctuated changes and the fade out of their possible impact.  However, I am unable to tell whether this is better than a common bar chart.	You might just as well plot the number of changes per week, and thus visualize punctuation in a way that is easy to convey and understand. It may also be that other visualizations perform just as well.  Please give some evidence (or at least some argument) for why spectrographs are superior, possibly using examples.   Overall, despite the paper being clear and well-written, it fails to make its point.  I doubt that the visualization is superior to the state of the art, and I fail to see that evolution being "punctuated" comes as a surprise. The paper should present more evidence on these points.   Minor comments:   Lanza's evolution matrices actually have boxes with three (not two) dimensions: the color is also used.  The visualization suggests growth over time; however, files that have been deleted still occupy space.  Please discuss.  Although evolution of files may be superior to evolution of directories, why not being even more fine-grained and think about evolution of classes or methods?

Positive aspects:   Interested topic and results  Clearly written  Paper well structured  Very relevant to IWPSE   Negative aspects:   More credit should be given to authors who have pointed out the emergence of discontinuities in software evolution  Proceedings will be printed in black & white,  but the paper uses colors extensively  Slightly over the page limit (11 pages, when maximum is 10 pages)   Detailed comments:   This is an interesting and well-written paper reporting on research which is relevant to IWPSE.  The theme of discontinuous change in software evolution and the paper could give more credit to other authors which have published results in the topic.  There are some references to Biology in the paper but the conection with the Software Evolution theme is not clear. Moreover, one can argue that the relationships between Biological evolution and Software Evolution are many.

      Well folks, I will be offline for a while, starting soon. I dropped the laptop (well, I didn't  drop  it, I put it on the couch and it fell off it because I was stupid enough to put it too close to the edge, so one way or another it's my fault) and now it is only running on battery, because the connector where the power supply gets plugged into is all jiggly and sparky (and not in a good way). I got about 2 hours of battery life left, and I figured I'll save those for when I need them. It sucks, but I'll have to live with it until it gets fixed.

      Well, after finishing the homework for Algorithms (which also doubled as a review thingee for the final) I decided to do what I do best - be a flaming geek. See, I have this neat-o flash thumb drive. Which works fine on my laptop. But it didn't work on the workstation at work. It all came down to the kernel not having the proper drivers, which I promptly fixed by getting the newest source and rolling my own kernel (and while I was at it I cleaned the beast out a little bit - the person that set this up just dumped in about any kernel module he could find, even for archaic crap like ISA). So now the thumb-drive was all nice and working, but... The sound card stopped working! A little bit of investigation revealed that the problem lay with the alsa headers, it being that there were none installed for this kernel. No worries! Good ol' Google saved me there, and all I had to do was apt-get the alsa-source, build it, and reboot. Now, I still need to add a few bells and whistles here, because I can mount the thumb drive with two clicks on the laptop, but need to manually mount it on the workstation. That's no biggie, since I use the command-line quite often anyway, but it's still a thorn in my side. I'll just have to go back read the automount documentation.

      Yesterday I tried a new dish. Well, it's not quite new, more like a modification of an old one( Ginger Bacon Chicken ), but it was still so good that I've decided to share it with you.    Lemon Bacon Chicken with 'tatos   Ingredients:  Chicken Breasts.  Bacon (2-3 strips per piece of chicken).  Lemons (1 per 2 pieces of chicken).  Potatoes (1 medium to large per piece of chicken).  (Optional) Green herbs. Thyme does well, parsley too. Tarragon is also good.  Salt, pepper, whatever else you feel like adding.  Preparation:   Preheat oven to 400F. Slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch thick slices. Spread out on a baking sheet, so that there is a layer of 2-3 potatoes. Add salt, pepper, and maybe a drizzle of olive oil (not too much, else it smokes!). Toss with your hands. Stick into oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the top layer of potatoes starts to brown at the edges.   While the potatoes are in the oven, take each chicken and wrap it in bacon strips. The way I like to do it is to put 2-3 strips on a piece of plastic wrap (saves cleaning up the greasy slimy stuff afterwards) so that they are parallel, one next to the other. Put the chicken across in the middle, cross the ends of bacon on top. You don't need to pin them down with a toothpick as we did with the Ginger Bacon Chicken. Once all the chicken is wrapped, take the lemons and slice them into thin round slices.   Time to check on the potatoes! They should be ready any time soon, just don't take them out too early. Once they're out,  let them cool a bit.  Once they're cooled down, you can shuffle them around a bit. The bottom ones will have probably stuck to the baking sheet, which is why we let them cool down, they'd break otherwise. You'll notice that they're not done yet. Once shuffled and tossed, Sprinkle the herbs on top. Then place the chicken on top of all that. Just on top of the potatoes, that's it. Next come the lemon slices, which cover the chicken. Now put it all back into the oven, and wait until it's done. How do you know it is? Well, because the bacon will be done. Just watch the bits that are exposed, and once they're all nice and crispy then you can be sure that the chicken is done, potatoes are steamed and baked. Neat, huh?  Alternative: You can also pre-cook some other vegetables (carrots, squash) and place them along with the potatoes under the chicken.  As you've seen, this dish is very similar to my Ginger Bacon Chicken in execution. The problem I had with GBC was that it's a bit dry, and the flavor wasn't well balanced. BLC fixes those two problems.

      So, I got this wee camera with a memory stick. I plug in the camera - Windows crashes. I buy a USB stick reader. Windows can't find the driver (even though I specify the location with the right driver). I unplug my (USB) mouse and plug it into a different port. Can't find the driver. I plug in a printer. Can't find the driver. I cry. Can't find the driver. Then I check on the internet, maybe someone there has a solution. First link is a Mandrake Linux forum. They seem to not have a problem... Hmm! I boot into Linux, and  LO AND BEHOLD!  There the fucker is. No problem whatsoever.

      *Geeky laughter & snorting ensues* Alright, I got the presentation for MPLSA done with. Which is good, because it was a 1-hour beast that kept me sleepless all week. Which is bad, because sleep is good. So now I'll be able to get some decent rest for a little while. A few days at least. Ok, would you believe me if I said one day? A night? Would you believe me if I said that I won't hurry to go and do all the stuff that I need to get done? Alright, I admit it, I will end up stressing myself again really soon. Mainly over the Algorithms midterm. And then the stuff for work. Because the folks in the Operating Systems class are turning their assignments in really soon. Which means that I will be doing a lot of work. Someone kill me, please.

      For some reason I cannot fathom the street that I'm on has been claimed by a couple of ducks. Probably the same couple that caused that fucker in an ugly-ass Aztec (seriously, that car looks like it was designed by a blind retarded mime - no offense meant to blinds or retards) to stop in the middle of the road (which by the way has been torn up to apparently replace a water main) without turning on the hazards to watch them ducks on the side of the road. Now the reason for it to be unfathomable is that the nearest lake/pond/major puddle of water is at least one mile away from here, and every time I see them ducks they're further away from it. I got pictures, I'll post them once I upload them to my computer.  As I'm writing this I'm watching some big-ass clouds roll in. It looks like it's going to rain.  Again . It seems that hereabouts you get 4 days of rain per day of sun. On the good side, them's some darn pretty skyscapes to be seen, specially when the clouds move in from over the horizon.  I got a recall notice in the mail. It seems that earlier (99-02) VW Jetta models have a potential problem with the brake light switch that can cause the brake lights to fail. Fortunately that hasn't happened yet, but I've got an appointment at the dealership anyway to get it fixed. And since the car's due for its 60k inspection (well it's at 64k now but that's ok because I had the oil change done at 54k) I'm doing both at the same time.  I met with one of the TAs for Algorithms today and went over some of the assignments. That is, he explained me how to solve them, and I went "Ah, so  that's  how it was supposed to go." In the end I concluded that a lot of my troubles are because I haven't memorized logarithm conversions. But at least now I've got a bit more of a clue as to how to approach the problems. See, what they call the  "easy way"  is actually the  "long and tedious but requiring little thinking if you  memorize all this shit way."  Every once in a while I come upon a band that sounds so-so when I first hear it, and then 3 years after I listen to the stuff again and think to myself "wow, that is some good shit."  Dream Theater  is one of them.

      Someone pulled the fire alarm today. Again. With finals coming up, there always seems to be some loser who can't deal with the fact that he's (or she's - let's not discriminate), well, a loser. I don't know about you, but in my opinion anyone who thinks that pulling a fire alarm or calling in a bomb threat (yeah - that happened too) will save their grade deserves to fail, and should never get any job better than making hamburgers at McFatteners. Oh yeah, I shot this by the way   urlLink    It took less than a minute for these folks to get here from when the alarm had gone off.&nbsp; urlLink

      Things like this make me want to give up   Hi all, I remember that with a c++ char, it always has a trailing '\0' right? so if i have a char named name and i want it to hold 5 characters. Then i would declare it with char name = new char[6]? and when i do strlen it would give me 6 too right?  please clarify thanks.   These are 3rd year students. Did the world turn retarded while I wasn't paying attention?

      I'm generally not very aware of the environment when walking to school, but even someone as distracted as me gets to see quite a lot of the local wildlife. There's the  urlLink American Crow, American Goldfinch, and American Robin  - all of them pretty common sights on my ways. The Canadian Goose of course is a regular. Many more are just out there on plain sight. The only problem is that they tend to not be still, and by the time I dig out my camera and wait until it powers up they're usually gone. Even when I get enough time to take a picture it ends out being quite crappy, since the camera doesn't have optical zoom.

       I find it amusing that  urlLink these   urlLink two  newspieces were posted head to head on  urlLink Fark .   Also there's all these  urlLink complaints  about the Google IPO. You'll have to excuse me for not chiming in. I thought that Google had made it clear in their initial announcement that the IPO deal was not designed to profit the shareholders, but to provide an opportunity to invest in a high-risk deal. Boo-hoo for you, mister economist, but I think that their actions couldn't be better. Someone had to have the balls to go and try new things, and if there's a solid company backing it, then the better. And in the long run, it  will  be better for Google. They got where they are now by being innovative and staying one step ahead. If they settle now and focus on just making money they will soon be overrun by the stampede of companies behind that are just itching to get their foot into the lead. Similarly, I do not whine about their policy regarding scanning Gmail e-mails for advertisement. The scan has to be done anyway for their search and indexing service, and all they did was turn it into an unobtrusive service that boosts their earnings. Or would you rather have them attach 3 paragraphs of advertisements onto each e-mail like other free services do?   When reading articles like  urlLink this one , I can only shake my head skeptically. While the idea to debug code in plain english is laudable, it is not a magic tool that replaces proper design, unit testing, &amp;c. More importantly, the tool is of little use to professional developers. Domain-specific solutions to design-time debugging are more appropriate than a tool for release-time debugging. And from the description of the program, I have my doubts as to how well it works with fully reflective languages. I would prefer source code transformation tools that allow the programmer to abstract compounds within the code, and that guarantee that these abstractions are both atomic and reliable.

      What is tall, shiny, and buzzes when wet? Power lines!   Today was the last class day for Algorithms. the last assignment is due tomorrow, and the final is next week. So that's keeping me pretty busy it is. I know better than to cram all week however. I do not perform well under stress, so the best thing for me to do right now is to study bit-by-bit, and to take any possible chance to relax. Of the latter, there are plenty now. I've been getting up pretty early, but I've also been going to bed early as well. And I don't know if it's because of that or because I've been getting my life straight and on tracks, but I've been way more energetic these days than I have been for a long time. Of course, it could also be the beer. Damn good stuff it is, and relaxing on the Grad House patio and enjoying what I got at hand is not something that I can complain about.

      ...And it doesn't involve high explosives!    The past week has been quite eventful. I won't deny that it hasn't been good for  everyone , but what happened was inevitable. It is not something that I did lightheartedly, but I don't regret it. Amy was right in saying that I can't always act selflessly, and that I have to think about myself from time to time.   There are only 3 weeks left to the semester... It sure doesn't feel like it. It's been a busy time, and will be busier as the finals start creeping up. But despite that I am satisfied. I learned much in that time, both about school and about my life. Work is challenging, but not repetitive. And as much as I dislike Algorithms, I do have to admit that I enjoy many of the topics covered. Even the assignments are enjoyable -  because  they are tough it is much more satisfying when I find the solution. Perhaps some more programming and a few practical problems instead of pure theory would be nice, but I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.   Life is good, and I am happy. And just for this moment, that is enough. Cheers!

      I spent more than was planned on the programming assignment for Algorithms. I have everything working, except for one teeny little bit, which I just now figured out:  Y'see, the last part of the assignment is to implement Hirschberg's linear space algorithm for finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings. Which I have implement, but for one part: the place on the middle array where the longest path crosses it. The problem was that there is only one paper that describes how that is done, and in a very cryptic way. So I was banging my head against the wall all weekend, trying to figure it out. And today, when I woke up, it hit me (not the wall): What I need to do is traverse the middle list and for each element find the LCS length of what's up and to the left, and of what's down and to the right. The element where these sum up to be equal to the total LCS is one of the possible crossing paths, and that's where the rest of my program works doodly-well.  So, knowing that, I can finally dedicate some time to other things that I have neglected: The other assignment that's due tomorrow, and the readings for  urlLink MPLSA . That'll keep me busy until next week, where I'll have to start worrying about the next batch of assignments that I have to grade rolling in from Operating Systems.

      I've been toiling at this programming assignment for Algorithms all week. I don't think that the professor really expects us to do that much work on it. For all I know, we could have used simple arrays so that we could have focused on actually coming up with the right algorithms. But I'd already done that on the first day (coming up with the algorithm). It was, however,  fucking ugly  from a pragmatic programmer's point of view. See, the point is that the assignment expects our programs to run with character strings of millions of length. Two of them. And  then  the code they gave us as a hint for the algorithm makes a 2-dimensional array, with each of the string's length as the side length. So the first thing I did was put the two premises together mentally, and figure out that that's a  lot  of continuous space that gets allocated, most of which ends up not being used. So I did what any compulsive-obsessive geek would do, and started making my own data structures to work with this. And because I really like the way Ruby does things, I tried to emulate it in my data structures. Which ended up being a hell of a wok, but the results are very satisfying. Because now everything works, and the code is  elegant . Well, most of it. I cheated on one part, but only because I didn't want to deal with  friend  classes and whatnot. Which I could change I guess.   Well, now that I've implemented the first algorithm out of three I need to do the other two. And write the documentation. And some more tests.

      One of the many things I learned at TAMU-CC is that it sometimes is OK to not finish a project. It happens in real life - things get delayed, expectations are too high... One way or another, people here at UWaterloo get too worked up if they can't finish a project. They start acting as if it's a matter of life and death. Much of it is a result of this university's ties with the tech industry. Professors are scared of taking on risky projects because they might fail, and it does not look good in the eyes of the IT overlords when professors fail. So they stick to low-risk projects, and always try to find a justification for doing things. I wish that for once someone here apart from me would just do things "because it's neat/cool/interesting". Everyone's so uptight here, they all walk around as if they were really constipated.

       Today  Yesterday a student addressed me as "sir". Suddenly I feel old. Very, very old. I guess it's time for me to get a senior citizen card, pull my pants way up, and get a checkered jacket. And I'll have to work on providing involuntary flatulence. Bean dip, here I come!  At least there's a farmer's market close by for me to plow through with the car.

       Q: Why is the page size a power of 2?  Wrong A: Because computers work with bits (or variants) Wrong A: Because pages store code, and code is binary. Wrong A: Because it is nice for computers. Wrong A: Because the OS uses bits, and there are only two bits: 0 and 1.   How did these people get past their first year courses?

      Well, after an outrageous day of sleeping, sleeping, and more sleeping (Tuesday) I got back on track with work this morning with renewed energies. Assignment 3 for Operating Systems has been graded, and I can say that nearly all of my groups did a superb job. Tomorrow is their final exam, so I have to be at the university by 8 (am) to get ready for proctoring, and after that we'll dive right into marking the finals. I predict that it will be painful like an acid trip on a Halloween party. But then again, tomorrow afternoon there's the SCS fun party meeting at Kennedy's pub in St. Agatha. So if you're in the CS department, head over there for beer and some fun. Plans are for folks to be arriving there around 5:30 - 6:00. I can only hope that we'll have the finals finished by then.  Friday and Saturday will probably be rush days too - the project for MPLSA needs wrapping up, that is, we need to get some shit done by Sunday. As said before, no big problem there, since we pretty much already covered all the aspects that we wanted to when writing up the bullet-list outline, but we need to actually go and write the stuff down now.

      Since I don't watch broadcast news, I am pretty much detached from much of the media sensationalism. So I tend to just shake my head whenever people ask me if I heard about this crime spree or that beheading. And when I finally hear about how unethical news corporations are with their boradcasts, it kinda makes me glad to be so detached. Sorry bolks, but I have no sympathy for any group that blatantly claims to tell the truth but doesn't check on the facts, and then  urlLink blames third persons  for their own fuckups. Laugh at me for watching cartoons - at least  they  make me smile.

      So, I picked up the take-home exam for ECE 750 this morning. It's not very difficult, but it does take a lot of time, and I'm unusually tired today. So I decided to go home for a nap, and sleep over the problems. That's how I usually get my best inspirations, and today is no exception. The first question relates to reflective dimensions. As an example we are given the classic reification, with introspection on one end and intercession on the other. So my first thought was to look in the documents for other types of reflections, such as behavioral reflection and structural reflection. But when I woke up from my nap I had a new idea: reflection covers  what one does  with the meta information. One can just look at it and act upon it (introspection), but one can also modify it (intercession). But the papers also cover other things:  What  gets reified,  when  something gets reified,  how  it gets reified...  I am sure that both methods will yield a satisfying answer, so I'm not worried about which to use. But considering the distribution of topics in the documents, I think the latter is more homogeneous to the topics.  It suddenly got dark outside - looks like a thunderstorm is approaching. So there goes my intention of walking back to the office to continue working on the exam. Not that either way is that much better - sure, walking will get me the extra exercise I could need, but with the car I can make a stop by Sobey's and get some caffeinated sugary goodness for an all-night writing frenzy. Too bad that caffeinated Mountain Dew is not allowed here. Anyway, off I am on my road to academic glory.

      Articles like  urlLink this one  make me cringe - Not because they portray Newton as an alchemist (which he pretty much was, among other things), but because of phrases like "When we think of Isaac Newton, we usually think of [...] his invention of calculus." Now, repeat after me children: Newton did not invent Calculus. The term  Calculus  was created by Leibnitz, and Leibnitz alone. Newton would put your face to a blender if you spoke of Calculus. Yes, he came up with the ideas behind Calculus (1). But Leibnitz came to the same methods independently, and while Newton sat on his work and turned to pursue a career in alchemy and theology, Leibnitz did the true work to develop Calculus itself. As of today, there are two schools of Calculus - the one used in Physics (delta this, delta that) and the one used in mathematics (d this, d that). The first one relies more on approximation, the latter on clever formulas. Neither is wrong. But only the latter is, by origin, Calculus. And no matter who coined the term, no one  invented  it. It's not like it didn't exist one moment and suddenly  BOOM!  there it is. It was discovered, not invented. Capiche? Having said that, the  urlLink article  itself is decent material (excluding the aforementioned horror). Just as it happens with about every known important character in human civilization, Newton has been glorified by history books. Newton only had an exceptional intellect, but he also erred and had his superstitious, like every one of us. And it doesn't happen only to important characters. Many times we see news broadcasts proclaiming a rise in gang activity, as if gangs were a 20th (now 21st) century phenomenon. That is untrue - things happen, and they happened a long time ago as well. In the 19th century. In the 17th century. In ancient Rome. In Japan. Everywhere, everytime. What  is  different now is that information travels faster now than it did a mere 30 years ago. People feel overwhelmed by the barrage of news they get, and distances seem to shrink. This last week there was this newspiece about a supermarket fire in Paraguay. Some time ago that news would have taken months to get to the US and Canada, if at all... Now we hear about it on that very same evening. But such things happen now just like they happened in the past. History doesn't wait for us to repeat itself. But those that say that "it was better in the old times" are full of bullshit. At least now you don't have to worry about smallpox and fanatical religious persecution. Err, scratch that last one. The way things are developing in the US, you  do  have to worry about religious persecution.   --   (1) Some Leibnitz enthusiasts claim that Newton was a crook and stole the concept from Leibnitz. Newton's followers claim the contrary. I used to believe the former, but after reading  urlLink  Quicksilver   I ended up giving them both credit. Speaking of which, the third book of the Baroque Circle is out next month. That is something I'll be looking forward to buy.

      And it was everything I expected it to be. If you don't recognize the quote, then you should go see Office Space.  I needed a rest. For the last month or so I've been getting up regularly at 8 am (for those that don't know me, that's some 4 hours sooner than normal for me) and that's really been putting the drain on me. So I went to bed early last night. And slept in today. I'd say that I put in some 12 hours of continuous sleep. Then I had some tasty lunch, and went for another nap. So, now that I'm all nice and freshened up, I think I'll start working on the project that's due... Uhh... Friday? Some time around that. The good thing is that I already know what I need to write down. The bad thing is that it takes a fricken' long time. And with the last final coming up on Monday, and the Operating Systems coordinator wanting the assignments back on Wednesday, I won't have much free time this week... Again. But the week after that should be fun. Concerts, heavy drinking, and hitting on pretty ladies. My kidneys will hate me afterwards, I know, but that's way too far into the future to worry about.  Hmm... I think I should be going to bed again, and skip dinner in favor of a nice breakfast. With bacon. Can't have breakfast without bacon.

      In the past year or two I've seen Flash turn from a rather neat browser plugin to a horrifying plague. If it wasn't because jewels such as Strong Bad's E-mail are in Flash I would have dumped it quite a while ago. I specially hate those Flash ads that use sound - it's not only disruptive, but the sound is generally crappy too. Fortunately Mozilla (Firefox) has the Adblock plugin, which is a blessing, because it lets me specifically block flash ads. I've come to the point of considering to even starting to allow image-based ads again just so they'll fucking stop the flash ones. Well, as long as they're not the blinking, seizure-inducing type.

      During the last week I've noticed that the Google text ads at the top of my blog started showing links to sites related to parrot training. Which is rather funny, considering that I never talked about parrots. Or training. Of course, a title like "Your Eclectus Will Obey" brings all kind of ideas to mind if one doesn't know that Eclectus is a parrot. I wonder if they use  urlLink the crab  to teach them.

      Every once in a while I pick up a decent recipe on TV. The last one was on  urlLink David Rocco's Dolce Vita . I forgot the title of the recipe, but it was basically eggs poached in tomato sauce with cheese topping. I tried it last night, and boy is it tasty! So you take a frying pan, empty a can of tomato sauce in it, warm it up, put 3 or 4 eggs in, top it up with grated cheese (I used mozzarella), and presto! Well, for a spin I fried some bacon before adding the tomato sauce. HOT DAMN is that good! Definitively a keeper. And cheap too! Use 1/2 can and 2 eggs for individual portions.  Of course Alton Brown's  urlLink Good Eats  is always a good place to pick up ideas. Did you know that the guy has a  urlLink blog ? He's a pretty smart fella, and the good thing about his cooking tips is that they can be adapted and mixed into other recipes. One of the tips that I use most is how to pick a good pineapple. Specially now that they're on a special at Sobey's. Damn tasty they are.  Who else is on my "good recipes" list? Well,  urlLink Jamie Oliver  of course! The nice thing about  his  recipes is that they are not only fancy, but they're also done with considerably common ingredients. Part of my famous bacon-wrapped chicken recipe was adapted from one of his recipes.  But I have to give the most credit to  urlLink Mario Batali . He's the one who kickstarted me into fancy cooking. His recipes are down to Earth, but he manages to mix the flavors quite like an art.  Now, one of the shows that I'm most looking forward to this season is  urlLink Forever Summer , because the recipes I've seen there are not only tasty, but also add in nice presentation right into the preparation. Plus, the hostess has a rather dashing voice and look.

      The worse of this semester's courses is done with. Had the final today, and I'm terribly glad it's over. Plus, I got to get a nice buzz afterwards, and a decent conversation with a good looking girl. Can't complain about that, eh? As soon as the buzz wears off I'm heading back home for a good nap. Tomorrow I'm taking the car out to get new tires - I'll probably take it for a spin around Halton Hills in the afternoon - the roads there are pretty good for some nice cornering. The next final is on Monday, but it's a take-home exam, so I doubt it'll be that difficult. After that, all I have to worry about is grading the cs350 assignments, and probably proctoring the final for that course.

      I've had it with people associating boolean values with 0 and 1. That is a C-ism, but ends up being thought of as a universal case. That is  wrong . Very, very wrong. There is nothing special about 0 that makes it false. Zero is just another number. It is one of a set, be it Integers, Real numbers, or Fractions.  Now, take the value  false  on the other hand. It explicitly declares falseness, so it's a true false boolean value. It is a  nice  false, and gives you no chance of looking at it and think "Oh, it says false, so it must be true".  And while we're covering the topic of sets, let's add  nil  as well. Nil does not represent an empty set - it represents no set at all. It's nothingness. Not nil is something. And something, except  false , is true. So not true is false. To look at it in another way, always remember that "Nothing but false is false". Nil is nothing. So nil is false.  And that's the entire collection of falesess representatives:  false  and  nil . Everything else has  true  associated to it. Now don't let me ever catch you again trying to sneak in a  0 == false .

      ... The  urlLink bullshit  that the DOJ comes up with. My history teacher from high school used to have 2 sayings:  - Hazte la fama y echate a dormir. - No te duermas sobre los laureles.  The first one translates into "Get famous, then take a nap", and the second one to "Don't fall asleep on the laurels." They both had the same purpose: to remind us that we had to keep making an effort throughout the year actually be able to finish the course. But it also applies very well to the error that these pro-intellectual-copyright, anti-sharing fanatics represent. Because the trick is not to get a great idea and then sit on it. If you do, someone else will come up with the same idea through entirely different means, and then you're back in the gutter. Take a look at Google. They're doing quite well right now - but they know that they have to keep working to stay ahead. If you want to win the race, it's no good to try to keep everyone else in place. You actually have to move forward.

Byhakee byhakee now that you're here I've changed my mind, I'm filled with fear. People who go with you don't reappear. So leave me alone. I'll stay at home. I will forget we ever met.

      I first started using Hello, and it was good. But there were some things that I didn't like, such as not being able to add a title to the post, or edit it otherwise directly within Hello, and of course it not being available for Linux. So I gave Flickr a spin. And it's good for quick posts, specially when I'm at work. But when their webpage was inaccessible today I ended up going back to Hello. And since it's free now, I thought of giving Picasa a spin. Boy is that a neat application for cataloging pictures. It's a keeper. I can see why Google invested in it.
