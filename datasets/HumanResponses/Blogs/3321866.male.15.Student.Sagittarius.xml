      So yesterday was fun and such and I went to James's house right after school and he taught Steph and (somewhat me) the guitar. Me being the impatient one didn't quite listen so I just randomly played. Then we went to Claytons and had fun there and ate and oddly we all ordered the same thing...The waitress was great cause she put up with Chris's antics and we had fun. We walked Steph home and then found a shopping cart and tried to lewer CJ away from Emo ball. We failed so we went to video land and rented  "Better Off Dead"  and that was fun and Chris and James meet my grandparents and saw my little brother amuse them and my room which is cool I guess and Steph came and was scared by Chris and James. That was fun. Today my mom says "your shoes are too small" so we bought some Converse at the exchange that are navy blue and are cool and I also got some cool shirts that my dad owned when he was young and they look like something Gordo would wear so there cool. I'm going to wear them on Tuesday :). This is my life....Cool.

      Spanish project due tomorrow and all needed is editing and woo hoo its pritty much boaring but ok. All ours is is a birthday at a resturant and a commercial of Albertsons. Unlike Collins which is a super good awsome gun fight matrix pariody movie thats cool ours is simple and...simple. All the editing realy needs is a slide show tibit of Albertsons stuff. I really want to see the finishing product on Collins though :)  On another note yester day was my moms birthday and also (drum roll please) my half birthday!!! That means i can get my permit (Technically) and i just realized that when Ryan Jones said "Dont you know you can get your permit now?" and then i write. The first thing that comes to mind is "Road Rage" woo hoo. At our neighbors house we went to eat and for my moms B-Day and we started a conversation about road rage and the whole time i was listening i thought of "Road Rage Brad". I heard stories of Mr. Couture and his road rage and then the conversation stoped due to the stupidity of Kenny (8th grade friend) who climed well tried to over a turned over coucn on its end and it fell and he almost hit tons of Priceless pottery and Mr Couture said "Geise Kenny, why dont you just take a bat and hit the pottery!" It was great! Then we all realized that it was 10:30 so we left.  Im writing a story of Link and his adventures just for fun and its pretty good so far even though its one paage long...its good  adios....i think

      Jon is being a blog tyrant and I don't want him as an admin cause WELL HE ASKS ME IF HE CAN BE ONE AFTER ONE COMMENT AND COLLIN ON THE OTHER HAND HAS COMMENTED ON EVERYTHING SO HE IS ONE AND NO JON YOU DIDN'T ASK WELL ENOUGH AND DON'T YOU KNOW THAT COLLIN CAN DO THAT AND YOUR TO BUSY TO DO THAT CAUSE YOUR CAUGHT UP IN YOUR COSTUME THING AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING AND NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S GOING ON WELL JON IS RIGHT BEHIND ME AND DURING THIS WHOLE WRITING I ACCIDENTALLY PRESSED CAPS LOCK AND IM TO LAZY TO TYPE AGAIN. Ha um so no hard feelings Jon but one helper is enough and if you commented more than just that once then you would have had a fighting chance and such so.....School is dumb. Hunger pains.  Bye.

For those of you who don't know that really isn't my IM and it really is RynImp but as I said it makes my computer mad well it does. Add some comments on how to make links if anyone who knows how knows how who views this por favor.(for those who are Spanish stupid out there POR FAVOR means PLEASE)

      As on the last post  Zelda Four Swords Adventures  came and Jeremy got it and...It's one of those games...Were...It can't be bad. This game is awesome and can't go wrong! Force gems should  be ruppies but they aren't money so maybe they shouldn't. I always am the HERO OF DARKNESS and its kind of cool that I won a game with that title once. Tingles tower has a new meaning to all you Wind Waker fans out there and its this awesome mini game place. So far we have 2 out of 12 I think and the 2 we have are still really fun and they're suppose to get even better along the way! Hammer Tag as James saw on the web site is the next one and just the name makes it good. Were stuck on Death Mountain level and I think Collin Nik Jeremy and I all hate the bomos medallion part cause "I was trying to protect him!";) part is pure evil and that's only the first level of 3. More coverage on game in future.                                             urlLink

      THESE NEXT FEW SENTENCES PAST THIS LINE ARE RANDOM!!!  ******************************************LINE***************************************  Crime Scene  Man lying face down with blood trailing out of back. Two cops look over the body to  find the cause of death. The Chief comes by to find the results.  CHIEF: Did you find the cause of death?  Cops look up at chief.  COP: We believe it's the knife in his back sir.  ******************************************LINE***************************************  END OF RANDOMNESS!!!  WOOHOO! Staying' up is fun and watching  [Adult Swim]  is cool cause I get to see show like  Wolves Rain  and  Cowboy Bebop   and after watching those shows I realize that the DVD's of Bebop will be at Comic-con and that's a great and funny and cool show. Silent Hill is Fuckin' scary to watch or play! Chris, Alec, and I played it at his house after a game of Mario Party 1 and *shivers Pictures image of a bloody basket ball hoop with a dogs head underneath.* Awesomely Scary! As the title says woke up at 2:00 P.M. so I'm up...Still and board. Tomorrow I guess I'll roam until I find people. If I were  Mario  for Comic-Con.                               Still need for costume:                                         1)Overalls                                         2)Gloves                                         3)2 Big Yellow Pins                                         4)Brown Boots                                         5)Hat                                         6)Mustache                                         7)Red Shirt                                         8)Help  I might as well not be any thing since its  Day 17 405 Hours Remain  (and Collin, In Majoras Mask this message comes up at 6am and pm of each change where  it becomes night and day but my systems different)If I were to be Isaac I would need a lot of help from Collin and people who have seen him in a game cause his looks hard to do. I might just be picture guy.   Do the new poll.    ALSO  Check this picture of  urlLink Isaac . Isaac now that I see looks a whole lot easier than I thought so I might do both so on Parade Day I will consult wit my people. Remember these words I tell you.    urlLink Blades Will Bleed. Shields Will Shatter. But As The Light Fades...Will The Hero Rise Again? Or Will Darkness Reign?   Joy and Rapture:D
