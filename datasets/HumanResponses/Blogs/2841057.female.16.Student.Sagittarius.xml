      For you... (so little time by arkarna)  Took a while to drag me out of bed, aim some coffee at my head, saw the clock I'm running late, it's an ordinary day. And I'm like a dog on head, knock one out and then fall asleep, it's sad but true, I'd rather be with you. Don't you forget about me, When you're a celebrity, It will be only you and me before too long. So little time so much to do, I wanna spend my days with you. So little time so much to do, I'd like to spend one day with you. And if that day is not enough, maybe we can stay in touch, but I'm not making plans for tomorrow, for tomorrow nevre comes. Said I've been selibate for years, not out of chance there's no-one here, see I can't get my end away, another ordinary day, And I'd love to see a little more of you, Your clothes would look better on my bedroom floor...bedroom floor. Don't you forget about me, when you're a celebrity, I know you're busy, but we all need somebody - before too long. It's in your eyes, oooooh...

      Midnight Serenade - 12:12 pm   Sweet midnight serenade Under the moonlight's calm shade Listening to the music made While fireflies cast in parade  A lovely night with smile Of a moon from a thousand mile  Then the breeze humms for a while Whisperin words longer than the Nile  The beauty of nightfall, The stars made it all, As they scatter at the sky wall. so inviting, like giving you a call.

      May kilala akong isang babae. Di gaanong katangkaran, maputi, matangos ang ilong, at medyo payat ang pangangatawan. Lampas balikat ang kanyang tuwid na buhok. Madalas siyang antukin at mahilig matulog kahit abutan na siya ng pagtirik ng araw. Madalas din siyang puyat dahil sa pako-computer kaya halos araw-araw siyang huli sa kanyang klase. Masayahin ang batang ito kapag nasa kondisyon pero minsan ay seryoso sa mga bagay at solohista kung kinakailangan. May masasabi sa klase ngunit tamad mag-aral. Marunong gumuhit ng iba't-ibang naiisip at kung minsan ay dinadaanan niya ito sa malikhaing pagsulat. Kung hilig niya naman ang pag-uusapan, rock ang gusto niya sa mga musika. Pero minsan, dala ng emosyon at kalagayan, nagpapatugtog din ito ng mga musikang sentimental at mga tugtog na pwede kang sumayaw. Curious siya sa mga bagay na hinid niya pa alam kaya kung minsan ay nagsasaliksik ito. Marami siyang naiisip na mga bagay-bagay. Minsan nga lang ay hindi na niya nasasabi ito dahil para sa kanya, mahirap maipaliwanag ang mga bagay sa mga taong hindi handang unawain. Pero alam mo, sa tuwing kasama ko ang taong ito, parang nakikita ko ang sarili ko. Marahil siguro, ang tinutukoy ko...ay ako.

      Ang nakasulat sa isang papel na napulot ko sa kwarto ko...  It's friday evening, 7:25 in my clock. The breeze is cold and the rain just keep on pouring down. I have nothing to do and still bored on this day. Suddenly, something popped in my mind. It made me smile then I realized, you came into my mind. I think about yesterday and our conversation for hours. Siguro nagtaka ka bakit ako tumawag kahapon. Alangang oras at araw. Wala lang. Wala lang akong magawa and my last resort is to use the phone, so I called you. You're shocked and puzzled at the same time but you chose to talk to me. It's been a long time since the last time we talked together like that. For me, it's just an ordinary conversasion of a friend and I hope it means the same to you. Ang linya kong "hay nako," you miss it like the others, don't you? Nasabi ko 'to at napangiti ka at sinabi mo na it's been quite a while since you heard that sweet voice. Well, it's nothing. Don't mke deeper meanings of it. I hope that our friendship last 'cause I wanted to help you. I'm just here to help, so see yah!

And if I will continue that lifestyle, I'm sure I will have a stomach ache, isn't that a wonderful idea? hahaha... joke lang... hehe la akong magawa e.

      There is one thing I can promis you, I will miss you. And it will be so much that in every smile that I glance when I look at you is a tear that hides behind my eyes. I will weep as I laugh and try to forget the things that will remain forever. There may be some who are trying to bring back the joy in my eyes but it is only you who got the key to open it and bring back to life. I don't fear this moment, the moment of missing you, because I love you and it is enough to confide me. You have my faith even then, and it is still there, growing in my heart for years. I will miss you so much and it is hard to explain why or how or how long will it take. It is difficult to understand but everything comes in a matter of consequences. You taught me everything - to grow, to think, and to be what I am. How can I forget the years in my life that I spent with you? Just tell me how for a relief. And another tear had fallen from my eyes...

      Naalala ko habang tayo'y naglalaro ng baraha, naalala ko natalo mo ako, naalala ko na ayaw mo ng cakes, naalala ko kung bakit ka nagtataka nang umalis ako imbes na hintayin ka, naalala ko ang mga jokes mong corny, naalala ko nung gabihin ka at nag-aalala ka kung ano na ang nangyari sa mga alagang mong hayop na nakakatamad, naalala ko ang pagpunta mo sa bahay, naalala ko ang iyong pag-aalala, naalala ko ang mga compliments mo, naalala ko kung pano kita pinilit kumain ng cake, naalala ko nung magkasama tayo, naalala ko kung paano ka nakipagsiksikan para lang makadaan ako, naalala ko ang mga sinabi mo, naalala ko ang mga lessons mo, naalala ko ang lahat. Naalala kita...dahil ba bukas wala ka na? Wala lang naalala ko lang ang mga sinabi mo.

      Hello there, the angel from my nightmare The shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley We can live like Jack and Sally if we want Where you can always find me We'll have Halloween on Christmas And in the night we'll wish this never ends We'll wish this never ends  Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick strange darkness Comes creeping on so haunting every time And as I stared I counted Webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their insides Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight Stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (miss you miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)

      Tired, tired, tired. The way I am everyday after school. Nothing is new except for the rushed project that we finished early this morning. Good thing it was still accepted even though we're a little late. We got late because of that damn traffic.   Anyway, I'm here at home talking to my computer imagining the crowd at the Incubus' concert. Damn coz I miss it. But then it's alright coz I got loads of works to do. I need my time. They just made a wrong timing and I guess it's just their first and they'll go back. I'm not in the mood to booze an energy in a concert. I'm tired and what I really like is a relief. Something calming...something like a beach.

      Last night, I was reading this article my friend sent me, --- masarap talaga ang feeling ng IN LOVE...   lahat naman tayo naiinlab...  pero marami sa atin ang INFATUATED lang...   both LOVE and INFATUATION are sure to live as up to cloud 9...   pero MAG-KA-I-BA sila...suriin mo ang nararamdaman mo...  ang INFATUATION ay matinding paghanga...  it is an instant desire...  matindi ang iyong pagnanais na makasama ang isang tao...  samantala, ang PAG-IBIG ay tila nag-aalab na pagkakaibigan...  ika nga, it takes root and grows one day at a time...  kusa itong sumisibol...  hindi ito padalos-dalos o pabigla-bigla...  kapag ikaw ay INFATUATED, may feeling ka of insecurity...  hindi ka mapalagay...  oo nga at excited ka ngunit hindi ka totoong masaya...  sometimes, you doubt him/her...  sometimes you always ask but seems to find no answer...  may mga bagay din tungkol sa kanya na gusto mong malaman...  at pag hindi mo ito magustuhan,   like hindi mo pala gusto yung taste of clothes niya,   you'd feel very disappointed...  it might shatter the image you've built about him/her...  LOVE, on the other hand, understands...  it knows that your loved one has imperfections...  ito ang totoong pag-ibig...  binibigyan ka nito ng kalakasan...  you even feel his/her presence kahit na malayo siya...  distance is not a hindrance for your love not to grow...  you're sure he/she is with you in spirit...  of course, you want him/her near...  but near or far,   you know he/she loves you as much as you love him/her...  you can wait for him/her...no matter what...  when you're INFATUATED,   you tend to say that you want to get married as soon as time  possible...  masasabi mo na," I can't afford to lose you!"....  samantala, when you're IN LOVE,   you don't rush into anything...  you're patient...  you don't panic...  you plan your future carefully...  INFATUATION is smart with sexual excitement...  you want constant intimacy with him/her...  samantala, LOVE is a maturation of friendship...  it is always best to be friends first before becoming lovers...  pag INFATUATED ka,  iniisip mo na baka nagiging unfaithful na siya sa'yo...  LOVE is trusting the other person...  you know you can trust him/her...  and by feeling this way,  he/she even becomes more trustworthy...  dahil INFATUATED ka,  maaari kang makagawa ng mga bagay   na maaari mong mapagsisisihan in the end...  but with LOVE, you are sure of your every move...  maginhawa ang iyong pakiramdam...  you function well...  nagiging mas mabuti kang tao pag alam mo  na pag-ibig  nga ang iyong nararamdaman...  think about it...   think about the difference between   LOVE and INFATUATION...  you know, GOD is NOT a killjoy in love affairs...  LOVE is HIS idea...  He wants you to enjoy the REAL THING!   but......you have to be WISE!  or else, you might MISS it out...  worse, you'll just break hearts  or find yourself singing,  "sinaktan mo ang puso ko..."   after all, you're not settling for second best, right?  --- Napangiti ako sa nabasa dahil alam kong totoo 'to at matagal ko na 'tong  naisip. Mahirap manatili sa loob ng selda ng infatuation. Minsan hindi mo na  alam ang tama, Parang ang mundo ay umiikot lang dito at sa iyo at sa kanya.  Mahirap pigilin ang sarili habang inuudyokan ka ng puso mong mapanlinlang.  Akala mo tama, akala mo pagmamamahal. Masaya ka habang nandito dahil ni  hindi mo naisip kung bakit ka napunta sa loob ng seldang ito. Hindi mo maiisip  kung bakit ganoon ang mga ginagawa mo.Mahirap talaga. Pero sa lahat ng  mahirap ay ito ang pinakamahirap, ang tanggapin na hindi ito love kapag  nagising ka na at lumaya ka na sa katotohanan. Kapag naisip mo na ang lahat  ng iyong ginawa sa puro kasinungalingan. Wala kang paroroonan. Wala kang  hahantungan. Iiyak ka sa mga bagay na sana ay hindi mo na lamang ginawa at  mga bagay na hindi mo alam kung bakit mo iniiyakan. Iiyak ka na lang sa isang  gilid dahil nilinlang mo ang sarili mo. Sinundan mo kasi ang udyok ng puso  mong sinungaling at bulong ng tao. Napayaan mo ang lahat habang nasa selda  ka ng infatuation kung saan walang totoo, totoong pagmamahal.  Pero dadating din ang araw na maiisip mo na hindi pa huli kung ika'y  magbabago at babangong muli. At sana panibagong pagkakataon, mag-isip  ka nang mabuti. pag-aralan mo ang iyong nararamdaman nang hindi ka  ma-broken hearted dahil sa love walang malungkot.

      Admit it or not, I know what you feel towards me. Your jealous. Am I right? haha! What a mess. There's nothing you have to worry about. What's mine is mine and yours is yours, all yours. Poor little you cause you don't know who he really is. Whatever it is, I don't care. I'm minding my own business. I'm happy with my life and nothing has changed with or without you. :(

      Some say that in this world, nothing is for sure. Things do come and go whether you expect it or not. Most of the time, things come in unexpected places. Matters happen the way we never expected. Maybe, all we have to do is to expect the unexpected, cause life is full of interesting surprises.

      Essential Things - 10:16 pm 1/29/04  the eyes are blind for the mankind For they cannot see things that are lovely  They said that what is essential, Is invisible to the eye  They are priceless yet worthy,  Invisible yet powerful.

      Matagal-tagal na rin simula nang magsulat akong muli dito, at ngayon heto nanaman ako... nagsusulat ng kung anu-ano.  -ooooo-  Nakakapagod ang bawat araw. Napakaraming kailangang gawin. Mga bagay na kailangang asikasuhin at pagtuunan ng pansin. Pero minsan, naisip ko na maganda ang pagpapakapagod lalo na kung makikita mo ang mga magagandang naidulot ng iyong pagsisikap at ang kasiyahan ng ibang tao.  Nakatambak na sa aking desk ang mga paper works para sa school. Pero sa totoo lang pare, talgang tinatamad akong gawin ito. Hindi ko mahikayat ang sarili ko na simulan ito nang matapos ko na rin. Mahirap talaga kung hindi mo gusto ang mga ginagawa mo. Mahirap magpatuloy...mahirap magpakapagod.  Minsan, pumasok sa isip ko na ano kaya balang araw kung lahat ng kailangan mong gawin ay pwede na lamang pindutin sa isang button? Ngek! malabo mangyari iyon. At kung mangyayari man, hindi na kikilos ang mga tao bilang tao. wala nang dahilan para magtrabaho at magsumikap. Mawawalan ng saysay ang kalakasan ng ating katawan kung hindi natin gagamitin. Hay nako...! talaga naman ang katamaran kapag umatake walang gamot kundi ang ating sarili.

      Have you ever asked yourself that some things are so essential yet don' notice it? It is true. I'm taking my lunch earlier this day when something popped in my mind. It is about realizing that some of people may be very important to you but they never noticed it. Just like how you inspire or how others value you without knowing it.   Then after few chews, I rememeber the story that read from a book. It is about a man who has barber for more than twenty years. They had a good barber-and-customer-casual-relatiionship. They shared stories everytime he visits his barber shop. They talked about father and everything in their lives. then the moment has come. The barber have to leave his place cause his family have a new house and they have to move for a reason. So he went off with his family.  Few weeks later, the man's hair is growing. He miss his old barber friend. Hi miss his monthly visit for a usual hair cut that he used to have since his hair was still brown. The barber may never know that this man miss him but for this man, there are things great things that you'll never notice. Unknowingly, he thank his barber for giving him a perfect shave and haircut. He thanked him for sharing his life stories with a simple customer like him. He thank him for being a good barber and a nice person.   Well, as I said you may never know how much you mean to others. How thankful they were in meeting a person like you. How you inspire them in your own little ways which seems simple to you. Many people know me whether a little aquaintance or a good friend. But most of them never knew how grateful I am for hearing my nonsense stories. For listening to my old nobody-loves-me-monologue and for laughing at my boring jokes. (coz I talk so soft and in minimal voice, and jokes don't look like jokes.ü). To all those people, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I really appreciate it whether you also do or don't. hehe.. And to those if there are some whom I inspired, (is there anything inspiring about me?) hehe... THANK YOU na rin po. I love you guys... whether you hear it or not it's precious cause I really mean it from my heart. ü

      Iinsiip ko nanaman ang mga bagay na iyon. Mahirap pawiin ang mga masasayang nangyari na nangingibabaw sa aking alaala at isipan. Mahirap kalimutan ang taong tumulong sayong bumangon. Ang taong pinagkukunan mo ng dahilan at lakas. ang taong alam mong lagi mong masasandalan. Ang isa sa mga lubos na nakakaintindi sa iyo at naniniwala sa kakayahan mo. Hindi ko na kaya. May luha nanaman sa aking mga mata na dulot ng pinaghalong lungkot at saya. Bakit kung kailan maayos ang lahat noon pa mawawala ng biglaan. Ang pagkawala, pag-alis, at paglisan. Wala akong magawa at naiinis ako. Bakit kasi ngayon pa nangyari ito? Sana ay kahapon pa o di kaya'y bukas na lang, wag lang nagyon. Kung mapipili ko lang ang mga pangyayari sa bawat araw. Wala akong magawa sa dahil ito'y biglaan. Mahirap pero tulad ng sinabi ko at sinabi mo, ay kailangan. Nakakainis bakit kailangang malungkot pagkatapos ng saya? Bakit kailangang mawala ang ilang mga bagay. Hindi ko alam at hindi maiintidihan. Sana hindi na lang, hindi na lang nawala.

      rock on!  It's a blast! I just heard an old song from the Offsprings. It's really different when you hear your favorite song played in the radio especially those who are hard to find these days. Speaking of Offsprings... well, I guess latest songs weren't that giood as they used to be. I think they're better before when they were playing punk rock music which really rocks. *huh?*

      rock on!  An angel of truth and a dream of fiction, A woman is a bundle of contradiction, She's afraid of a wasp, will scream at a mouse, But will tackle a stranger alone in the house. Sour as vinegar, sweet as a rose, She'll kiss you one minute, then turn up her nose, She'll win you in rage, enchant you in silk, She'll be stronger than brandy, milder than milk, At times she'll be vengeful, merry and sad, She'll hate you like poison, and love you like mad.

      rock on!   While doing this post, someone texted me. It was my friend who just celebrated her birthday a couple of days ago. I told her that I don't have enough money to buy her a great gift kaya ganun lng ung gift ko for her. But I'm damn glad that she like it very much and actually, she said that she often wear it. She also said that it is the one that she'd been lookin for at the malls and she is so happy that I gave one for her. Well, I'm even happier for her. IT just means that I'm a good crafter. And you know what? I think she likes it evry much better I made it so special, just for her. *If you're reading my blogs, You're welcome! ü*

      Yellowcard  There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

                                      To see you when I wake up, is a gift I didn't                                  think could be real                                  To know that you feel the same, as I do, is a                                  Three-fold utopian dream                                  You do something to me                                  That I can't explain                                  So would I be out of line, If I said                                  I miss you.                                  I see your picture, I smell your skin on, the                                  empty pillow next to mine                                  You have only been gone ten days, but already I                                  am wasting away                                  I know I'll see you again                                  Whether far or soon                                  But I need you to know, that I care                                  And I miss you

      I took a candymag onine quiz on what will I be if I'm a boy and this is the result.   Everyone agrees Incubus’ lead singer Brandon Boyd has an edgy, scruffy charm to him the girls really dig. He’s deep, passionate, and practically a slave to music. And you, Candy girl, are no exception. With your sharp ear for melody and genuine love for lyrics, you know your calling has always been in music. And this has affected every corner of your life: from your point of view to your fashion sense. Rock on!

      I'm tired but I'm still here, sittin next to my pc and doing my post.   The Girl I Was With You  Listen, just hear me out Yes, I know we agreed When we break up, we'd never give in to this need To admit to each other, I miss you  Listen, just hear my cry No, I won't break my word If I do say, "I miss you," it will never be heard Let my heart whisper all that it needs to  How can you make and take a start And just leave me here hanging Can't even say what I'm feeling How could you make then break my heart If I can't say, "I miss you" Let me say one last thing  I miss her and all the things she could do I miss her just as much as I miss you I miss her, I know you're wondering who I miss her, I miss the man I was with you  I will never be the same  Listen just hear my voice, can you hear all the tears That I'm planning to hide for the next thousand years Just as long as you know, I love you  How can a blind girl see the light How can I find our kind of right How can you take away my sight How could you lose me in the night Then you come and take my heart away Now I'm losing this fight No, I will never be the same  I miss the girl I was with you...

      Life is a matter of perspective. Even when we talk about a sensitive subject such as love, it all depends on how you see it and it all depends on your perspective.  Here's a funny article about loving something, this is how it goes.  The Original version: used to be this:  If you love somebody, Set it free... If it comes back, it's yours; If it doesn't, it never was yours in the first place.   But the Pessimist's version is this:  If you love somebody, Set him free... If she ever comes back, he's your. If he doesn't, well, as expected, he never was.  The Optimist's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  Don't worry, he will come back.  The Suspicious' version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, ask him why.  The Impatient Person's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he doesn't come back within some time limit, forget him.  The Patient Person's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he doesn't come back, continue to wait until he comes back...  The Playful version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  *If he comes back, and if you love him still, set him free again, repeat*  The Lawyer's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  Clause 1a Paragraph 13a-1 in the second ammendment of the Matrimonial Freedon Act clearly states that...  The Bill Gate's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, I think we can charge her for re-installation fees and tell him that she's also going to get an upgrade.  The Statistician's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he loves you, the probability of her coming back is high.  If he doesn't, your relationship was improbable anyway.  The Possesive's version:  If you love somebody don't ever set him free.  The MBA version:  If you love somebody, Set him free... instantaneously... and look for others simultaneously.   The Psychologist's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, his super ego is dominant. If he doesn't come back, his IQ is supreme. If he doesn't go, he must be crazy.  The Marketing version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, he has brand loyalty. If he doesn't reposition the brand new markets.   Here is my version.  If you love somebody, you will care enough to share your life to help, to give, rather than to get or to receive.  If you love somebody, you will begin to invest more of your time, listen carefully to what that person is saying.  If you love sombody, you will rejoice at that person's success.  That's what the real issue in love is all about. And that's the right perspective.

      Together, we have seen many changes in our lives and the world since we first became friends. But somehow, even with all that has happened, our friendship hasn't changed, except to grow stronger.   Feeling close to another is such a special feeling and adds so much to life... no wonder your friendship means so much to me!   When I stop to think about it, the closeness we share is right up there with the things I value most in life. Just being together always means the start of good times... thought-provoking times... and even provoking times! (But isn't that the way it should be?)   If we couldn't talk things over and make things right, we never would have made it through these changing times, remaining the good friends we are.   There aren't many people I could say this to, but I can say to you--if there's ever anything I can do to boost you up or help you out or get you through, I'll be there. And if you simply want me to be with you to share a joyful moment... nothing could make me happier.   We've been through so many changes... some of them for the good. Others have been difficult. But through it all we've known we could always count on each other!   That's why I feel so good about the times we'll share in days to come...positive about life and all the happiness it can hold. And I truly know in my heart, through all of life's changes...  We'll always be friends no matter what. I value this friendship as much as I value you, cause you're so special to me and I love just the way you are. ...we'll always be friends.ü

       11:06 PM 07/18/200  &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday morning, I woke up with a pleasing mood. My day was great and I'm happy that my best bud finally gave a chance to meet me. 'hay nako.. utang na loob ko pa... anyway' hehe... We went to a mall and had some donuts instead of a cup of coffee because our favorite cafe dont have a branch on that mall. hehe... Well then, of course, what we did is the usual-window-shop-for-future-shopping routine. Then, she left cause she need to meet someone and I decided to stay at the mall. I looked for the book "Who Moved My Cheese? by Stephen Johnson" at the National Bookstore. We need it due to our book report which we have to submit few weeks from now. Gosh! It's so expensive, though it seems that its price doesn't worth it, maybe because it's a bestseller and the author. Hmmm... anyway.. well then... I went home without any book purchased. Hehe...

      Friendship is a pricless gift, that cannot be bought or sold. But it's value is far greater than a mountain made of gold.   For gold is cold and lifeless, it can neither see nor hear. And in a time of trouble, it is powerless to cheer.  It has no ears to listen, no heart to understand. It cannot bring you comfort, or reach out a helping hand.  So when you ask God for a gift, be thankful if he sends... Not diamonds, pearls or riches, but the love of real true friends.

       Our preliminary examination in math is through, though I still don't have the permit. Luckily, my prof allowed me to get the exam and just tell our tiny proctor to write the "no permit" mark in my test paper. Anyway...it's not an ordinary day. hehe...cause I came home so early that I still got the chance to watch a movie. Our exam tomorrow will be ics and philosophy. I'm quite nervous, not because of the test but because I still don't have the permit and if the proctor will allow me to take the exam. Where is that f--kn student's copy which I need to get a permit. I've been at the osa and dean's office but it wasn't there..whatta h--. They told me that I'm supposed to get it two weeks after the first day of school but I missed it. But then, there are also other students who missed to get it but when they came back yesterday, it's there. Where's my damn copy! Sh-t I need it! Grrr... I need to go to the osa again to ask if I can get another copy and just give the requirements. Huhh... Too tired for this. I need a rest and a time to review. See yah!

Hay nako... talaga naman.. buhay.ü Di ako makapag-aral ng masyaso dahil ang hirap ng biyahe. Araw araw, sa tuwing pag-uwi ko, pagod nako kaya inaantok na at makakatulog na. Tapos maaga pa gigising kasi maaga ang pasok.
