      It's good to have a day off, well...kinda. I had to work in the morning, but I think that's better than working at night... any day.  So, as soon as I came back home, I had to sleep since I had only about 4 hours of sleep the previous night. But during my sleep, I was thinking about life in general. I don't think most of us realize how valuable this is. Especially those of us who don't believe in eternity. I mean, this life is all we have. Once it's gone, it's all over. I really hate sounding negative, but this is reality for us. The day we lose someone, that person is gone forever. Yet, despite this stark truth that's right under our nose, we still bicker and fight about simple trivial issues. I remember reading about this debate where the theist argues that since this life is all that there is, it doesn't matter how we live it. I mean both Hitler and Mother Teresa came to the same end, it doesn't really make a difference as to how they lived their lives. In some ways, I do see what he was trying to say, but in my humble opninion, that was perhaps the most unintelligent thing to say.  I agree with the argument that the atheist put forward and that was, because of our mortality, we must make every effort to make the most of us. In the sense, we must live good and ethical lives in order to preserve humanity. Life is beautiful and the biggest sin is to take it away from someone.  For instance, I understand fully well that Al Qaeda does not represent mainstream Islam but are just a radical group that have taken to the highest level possible. The beheading of Berg, Johnson and now the Sun-il. I'm not sure how their logic of a heavenly reward fits into this grand scheme.  If there is a god, then I sure hope they get their dues.  But I believe the point I'm trying to make here is evident, i.e. life is precious and every single waking minute must be utilized carefully.

      Sometimes, I wish life was simple. But the sad part about it is that it's not. For most people, this is actually a blessing. I guess they relish the challenge of working it out, trying to make ends meet. But I'm pretty sure that this group would represent a minority...very sure.  I'm still studying but everything seems so complicated. The number of people you meet everyday, the tasks to be fulfilled, the obligations to be met, it's just so unbelievably taxing on oneself. But then, I have the blog to come to... something tells me that this attempt might just actually last.  The problem I think lies in the fact, that I've still haven't found what I really want to do. The even bigger problem I think is that I'm not doing as much as I should be...or even close to it.  I can't remember who said it, but I love this quote because I think it definitely has some truth value, "How you spend your days is quite accurate of how you will spend your years". Now if this is 100% correct, then I'm in deep deep trouble. I think a very bad excuse at this point would be "but so are blah blah others". This, I believe, downplays the accountability that one should have towards oneself.  What's the resolution? I have no freakin idea... if I did, I wouldn't be writing this entry. But that's one purpose of this blog. I am going to try to track down myself...how I go about accomplishing my stuff.   That light at the end of the tunnel seems so far off.

      Just finished my exam on Thursday, honestly, all I need is a pass and half my worries will be over. It shouldn't have been this hard. But then again, being a chronic procrastinator, the inevitable cannot be prevented.  Anyways, I was just chatting with my web designer buddy on msn. I was quite surprised to find out that he wasn't satisfied with his line of work. I mean, it seems like this was the stuff he was born for and now, that he wants a career change is disturbing. Yes, disturbing would be the word I choose... why? what if, after all this searching and hunting, I end up finding something I "love" and to realize later, that I may have been wrong?  I'm not sure I'd have the emotional stamina to go through this whole process again. Speaking of the present one, I'm far from even getting an idea of what I want to do.   Oh well, as they say, sometimes, only time can tell.

      I'll be honest, this isn't the first blog. I had about three others (the third lasted about 50 mins) and for some strange reason, I just couldn't get to finish them off. Well, I mean continue them. And actually the reason isn't strange or unknown, but I think that I felt like a different person in those blogs and that just isn't right.  The whole purpose of blogging is to remain true to yourself. I mean everywhere you can be this cool, "mature" person that everyone expects you to be. But here, in this lil bloggin world, that ain't happening.  As I mentioned in the profile, I am working towards acquiring a bachelors in Com Sci. It's fun, except I just wish I could get it done and over with... maybe not. I still know squat...  Anyways, I guess I'll end this entry with that, got to go for work in an hour. RM

      So, I guess today marks an "auspicious" day, since today we added one more to the business team. I must admit that I am a little worried since our business plans are quite diverse. On one hand, we want to start with off with B2C idea and stay in our own home turf. The disadvantages of this would be that even though we are aware of what the market's like, we also know that it's extremely competitive, downright nasty and little scope.  On the other hand, there's a goldmine out there, but too far and a lot of investment and capital would be required to make the jump. But once it's made, it'll be a good one...really good one. But that initial jump is a real big one and would require at least 5-6 times the investment required to start off from home ground.  I'm not really sure how to go about deciding as to which route to take. Perhaps, both can be approached? I'm really not sure at the moment and there's a lot of pondering to do.

      So far, this summer has been one heck of a busy one. But, as I reflect about this, I think I like being occupied. I'm exceptionally good at wasting time when it's in abundance. But of course, there's still a long way to go and many wasteful habits to be unlearned.    After talking to Steve, I began to wonder about my money (since the topic was about savings). Everything deals with money in this life...unfortunate, but that's the case. The more you have, the results are boosts in so many areas, like confidence, friends and pretty much life in general. And then after talking to Adam, he invests in books and his movies. I mean that's an awesome hobby and lots of people indulge in it. But I need something for the long haul. Hence, the business plan that is already underway between Stan and moi.     I think one of the big ones I missed in the above list was respect. People for some bloody reason respect those who have a lot of dough. Gone are the values, knowledge and wisdom. "It's all about the money".
