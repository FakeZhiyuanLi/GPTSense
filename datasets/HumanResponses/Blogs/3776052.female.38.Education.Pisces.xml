      Hi all, Well here we go again. I don't feel quite so fed up today, just REALLY tired. I had to get up during the night for a pee (oh the joys of being pregnant!) which consequently disturbed the puppy. She then decided that she needed to pee aswell and so I got up with her. There really isn't much on the television at 3am so it was pretty boring, but once I'm awake, I'M AWAKE!! So there we sat, watching drivel, hoping beyond all hope that boredom may just lull me back to the world of nod. The puppy fell asleep almost immediately in the most awkward place that she could find meaning that all hope of sleep was now lost to me because I am a really wriggly sleeper. I eventually managed to get her into a different position at about 5.30 this morning, and I have to get up at 6!! I suppose, as someone trying to be funny said, that this is maybe good practice for getting up for night feeds with the baby. WELL THEY ARE WRONG! I consider myself to have had more than enough practice of getting up with babies as I have already done it with 4 other children single-handedly, and feeding a baby is quite different from getting up with a puppy. When you get up to feed a baby it is quite relaxing and it helps you to get back to sleep afterwards (assuming that the baby goes to sleep afterwards). With a puppy you have to take it outside, wait around for it to do what it needs to do, then hope that it wants to go back to sleep and not play. I have tried to rest up a bit today to make up for the sleep deprevation, but there's so much that needs doing around here. Unfortunately I don't seem to have the enthusiasm or energy to do any of it. I just kind of sit there thinking to myself 'oh I must get those cobwebs down in a minute', then think, 'exactly, in a minute'. It never actually gets done. I always thought that when I finished work that as I would have more time that I would be able to keep on top of the housework, thats's a joke! I was reading a magazine this morning. There was an article about 'Ante-natal Depression'. I can't say that I've ever heard of this before. Apparantly it's quite common, I think maybe because we all such unrealistic ideas about how pregnancy is going to be. I assumed that my pregnancy would be like the last 4 only to be proved totally wrong. Oh well, it's nearly time to go get the kids from school, best go and at least wash up!!  Chickie

      Well this may be incredibly boring to most of you people out there in cyber land. I'm just writing this to get a few things off my chest. Being a Mum of 2 with another on the way, and being so very ill with this pregnancy, I don't get out much so this seemed like a good way to talk, without actually having to talk to anyone. I've always disliked Mondays. I thought this would get better once I actually stopped work, but its pretty much the same. Instead of worrying about going back to work and what the week holds for me, I now fear being left here alone again for the whole week (there's just no pleasing some people eh!). We've recently got a puppy (Yes I know I'm mad) but we had been promising the kids for a long time that we would get one, and there wasn't much of an excuse not to now I'm at home. I love my kids, but they drive me mad. Is that normal??? Anyway, I digress, the puppy is really cute but is not house trained (puddles and piles everywhere), and whines a lot. I really haven't got the time or the energy to play with her constantly, I try to as much as I can though.  I haven't found this pregnancy easy, maybe because I am getting old (won't tell you how old but let's just say that 40 is creeping up rapidly.) I have gotten over the morning sickness, but still feel queasy at times throughout the day. My husband is the most understanding man in the world and I really appreciate the way he helps me, but what he doesn't understand is that I've never had a very good self esteem, and at the moment where I feel 'ill' most of the time and I'm getting bigger by the minute, I feel a little insecure. Now before you say it, yes I do trust my husband. I can honestly say that I have never trusted anybody more than him, but I also know what a kind and caring kinda guy he is. He spends a significant amount of time on the internet on a certain website 'chatting' to people. I don't think that he would lead anybody on purposely, however, I know that he can tend to take other people's problems on board and try and help as much as possible. I have read some of the things he has said to people and they could easily be misconstrued by somebody that isn't in their correct state of mind shall we say. I've spoken to him about it but I'm sure he thinks I'm being silly. I suppose I feel silly. I don't know, but I do know that it's getting me down. Well that was my very first moan, I feel a little better I suppose. Let's wait and see what happens next then shall we........  Chickie

      Well today I decided to be a good parent and go to the annual Govenors Report to Parents at my children's school. I was reluctant to go because normally you just sit around and listen to them whittle on and then go home, but today they decided to get parents to go that they would let you look at your children's work. I told the kids that I didn't feel up to it this morning, but then after running a huge guilt complex all day I decided that I really should make the effort. So I turned up smack on 2.30 when it was due to commence, and as I thought, we sat and listened to them go on for a bit and that was about it. I'm kinda glad I did go in a way because only about 4 other parents turned up. Consequently I was at school until nearly 4pm because I had to go over both the childrens work (quite meticulously) lol. This kinda made up for the morning I had. I have desperately been trying to get my hands on my form MATB1 (certificate of pregnancy) for the last week. I need to have it for my employers by the time I reach 25 weeks or I will loose my Maternity Pay. Also my husband needs it by 25 weeks so that he can register his intention to take paternity leave. My Midwide EVENTUALLY decided to get back to me today to tell me that I couldn't have it until I had reached 28 weeks. WHY??????? So I spent most of the morning chasing my tail, trying to find out what to do next from my employer, my doctor and the Maternity Alliance. Why is nothing every straight forward???? Well I suppose today could have been worse....... it could have been Monday!!!

      It would seem that this has turned into somewhere where I just go to moan,but never mind. Today I have discovered that I am totally useless. I have gone from an independant woman who has her own income and can provide for herself and do everything for herself, to a gibbering useless idiot. I seem totally incapable of the most basic tasks for one reason or another. Today whilst trying to assemble a shoe rack it fell on me. Yes it was a little painful, but not enough to usually reduce me to tears. Unfortnately I then started to feel sorry for myself and realise that this was something I could have done standing on my head in the past. When I moved into my house (5 years ago now) it was a shambles, totally unfit for human habitation in my opinion. However I put my nose to the grindstone and did my best to make it better for myself and the children. This meant decoration throughtout and some DIY stuff. I did this without any trouble at all, but now even something like sorting out a chest of drawers has turned into a major ordeal. I just feel useless, like I can no longer contribute to the family, and that I am putting too much pressure on my already over pressurised husband. I think the strain has been showing on him lately too, he seems very discontent with things as they are. I just don't know what to do to make things better. I feel so exhausted most of the time (exhaustion like I have NEVER felt before) this compounded with the fact that I'm not sleeping well either is some of the problem, but not all. I can't see anyway to change it until the baby is born, but that just seem like such a long time away, and there is so much to be done in the mean time. I sometimes feel that I just get in the way and make things worse for everybody. And guess what...... yes tomorrow's Monday, guess which day isn't my favourite day of the week????????

      Well here we go again on yet another moan. For the past 48 hours or so I have felt generally nasty. I didn't sleep very well on Friday night and was up at early o'clock Saturday morning so on top of feeling like poo I was knackered aswell!! According to all the journals and bits and pieces on pregnancy I should be in the 'blooming' stage..............blooming awful if you ask me!! There was me being all complacent thinking that this pregnancy would be the same as the rest. I should have realised things would be different as I am now that much older. I'm totally fed up with feeling ill and useless. It makes you feel like you're letting everyone down. The children have been on school holidays for the last 3 and a half weeks and we have done next to nothing because I just can't stand the heat and get out of breath so quickly. The house is being pretty much neglected. I'm trying to keep on top of things, but again I just can't, and if I do go all out to catch up I end up feeling a lot worse than I did anyway. It's a good job that I've got probably the most understanding husband in the world, however I can see the strain on him but just don't know what to do about it. I went to bed for a lay down yesterday afternoon and just cried and cried. I just thought that there was no reason for me to be around, that I was just making people unhappy and that I should not be such a burden. Luckily it wasn't too long before I dozed off because if my husband had seen me in such a state I know it makes him feel bad, and that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid. Oh well, I had a decent nights sleep last night so maybe today will be a bit easier (I hope!). Once more unto the breech............  lots of love Chickie xx

      Well just to make things more interesting I have just returned from the midwife who thinks our baby may be a little large,  5  weeks too large to be exact. So now I am suffering with a bad case of ' Giant baby syndrome',  or at least that's what I have lovingly decided to call it!   I had thought for a long time that the baby was seeming to kick awfully high for it's date, but today my worst fears have been recognised lol .  That's just what I need, to try and give birth to an enormous baby, as if it isn't painful enough trying to give birth to an average one! The upshot is that I have to go for another scan next week to check the real size of Little-bump. Oh well, maybe they'll discover that my dates are totally wrong and it will come early, I do hope so, this heat is killing me!  Chickie xx

          Well here we are several weeks into the school summer holidays and if I hear the words 'I'm bored' or 'are we going somewhere nice today' I think I may just go mad!  Why is it that children nowadays seem to think that parents were put here solely for entertaining their children? Or, is it just my children?   When I was a child my father worked strange shifts and my mother didn't drive. We lived in a small village about 8miles from the nearest town and the bus service was virtually non existent. Asking my Mum if we were going anywhere nice today' would surely have earned me a clip around the earhole!  I'm not saying that I never got bored, I just knew better than to complain about it and managed to find things to do to amuse myself.  We bought a puppy back in June. I kinda thought that the children may have some fun with her but if you mention playing with her or taking her for a walk they have some reason why they don't want to ie. I'm watching this on the tele. This happens if they've only been complaining how bored they are minutes before!  To make matters worse the kids can't seem to get along for more than about 2 minutes before they're at each other's throats (quite literally). I feel so tired just recently (guess it's the hormones or something) and quite frankly the children are driving both me and my darling husband up the wall!!  They don't seem to be able to see that they're driving you mad until you're nose to nose shouting at them. I just don't know how they can be so unaware of people's feelings.  I love them to death, of course I do, I just could really do with them not being around at the moment. Does that sound bad??  Well I've got that off my chest. Any advice would be gladly accepted.
