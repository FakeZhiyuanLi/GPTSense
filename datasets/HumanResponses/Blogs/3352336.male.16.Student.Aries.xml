       Finally!  After one mother of an Economics exam, I am free from the horrible experience that is   GCSE  .  I actually think I did quite well in that exam, and am rather pleased with myself that I could answer all of the questions presented to me. For once.  Whether or not I got the right answer is another matter...

       urlLink http://www.swift3d.com/illuminations/   This looks like quite an impressive site, showcasing some greater flash sites that use the Swift 3D technology.

      Welcome to my new blog: Best Uses for Broadband.  Here I will post all the cool sites where broadband is required, or enhances the experience. I am dying to see them in their full, and will probably go though this list once I get broadband.  If you already have broadband and would just like some extra sites to surf to, don't hesitate to take a look at the links on this website. There should be some really interesting ones, and it would be quite kind of you if you would comment on the particular link in question.

      Many people think, it was the last episode of 'Friends' last night. I also have my 'contacts' who have told me otherwise. there is going to be another episode if the sitcom, but as it is 'The One Where They All Die'. it is slightly unsuitable for family viewing. there you go. NOT the last, just almost.

      That's right! I know!  It will be very interesting, because the new contestants are somewhat, special.  But I can't tell you. Sorry. Security reasons. Just tune in.

      I was wondering if you knew that the   world is actually a cubic shape  . It's true!   Scientists   made the whole spherical thing up  just for more money, but I know the truth. All those photos from space are  just fakes !

      According to my good friend Ronnie Werner, of  urlLink Ronnie Werner Illustration ,  Mr. Foreman and Miss. Beacon are getting married!    You heard it here first, folks!   Details of the most prestigous union of the year will follow.  I sure do hope they allow  Hello  or  OK  the rights to their wedding photos. They will be the most interesting and glamourous yet!

       I was happily walking down the dirty streets of liverpool today, when I saw Mavis Beacon.  Now it was only a shot glance, but I am positive it was here.  For those of you who do not know, Mavis Beacon is the brilliant typing tutor and black (oh, sorry, afro-carribean) woman, who found software so good,  she put her name on it !  Much like  urlLink George Foreman , come to think of it.
