      CNN  urlLink reports  today that brand name drug prices have increased 3.4% (3 times the rate of inflation) since Bush enacted his new medicare policies.  The new cards do not make price savings certain for consumers, allowing drug card companies to modify their "discounts" any time they please in order to maximize profits.  The most interesting point of the article states:   AARP researchers looked at the wholesale price of 197 brand-name prescription drugs most used by older adults.  When manufacturers charge wholesalers more, "this added cost is generally passed on as a similar percent change in the retail price to most prescription purchasers," the report said.   It would seem that in an attempt to privatize medicare responsibilities, the Bush administration has actually increased the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, a key demographic in its constituency.  Additionally, the Center for American Progress recently  urlLink  discovered  an unsettling connection  between the major drug companies involved in the discount program and large campaign contributions to Bush.  It seems that 20 of the 73 (roughly one third) have been involved in fraud charges.  Scary!

      I decided to go for a slightly less offensive blog template.  The green was hurting my eyes, and probably yours as well.

      I went to see the much anticipated  Fahrenheit 911  last night with a friend of mine.  To say the theatre was packed is a serious understatement. It's the first time I remember waiting in long lines to get into a movie at Kips Bay.  Michael Moore bigger than X2 or Matrix?  Crazy.  The movie is basically Moore's book  Dude! Where's My Country  (which I read) put onto a film reel.  If it was Moore's intention to lash out at Bush and take every stutter, every incomplete answer, every "bushism" and string them together into a seemingly endless 2+ hour movie experience, he achieved it.  The movie is not bad, but it does at times lack substantiated proof to support the claims providing the foundation.  This, by itself, does not reveal much, especially since the very nature of a secret is that it remain a secret.  Like Pearl Harbor or the Kennedy assassination,  most of the secrets Moore tries to examine in his film will never see the light of day.  It is clear to me, however, that Bush is simply a cog in a huge political machine.  Instead, I believe Moore is simply trying to put as much information as possible out there to increase awareness before the election.  It's like he's saying "look at the coincidence that a failed pipeline plan through Turkmenistan was immediately resurrected after Bush invaded Afghanistan.  Need more?  Is it just another coincidence that Halliburton has been given millions of dollars in defense contracts?  Still not enough?  How about the planes that were arranged to fly the Bin Laden family out of the States right after 9/11 that were authorized at the highest levels of government?"  Although Moore definitely has a statement to make, I think he is trying to encourage people to look at the information that we do have; to see Bush's endgame.  Although I do find many of his coincidences a little too coincidental, I am not going to take the movie as gospel.  As someone who is not intending to vote for Bush in November, the movie is not going to be the single issue I take with me to the voting booth.  Still, I wonder what effect this movie will have on the people voting sitting on the fence.  Or the ones voting for Nader.

      On Columbine...   Slate recently posted  urlLink this article  describing how a group of well respected psychologists and criminal investigators assembled 30 miles outside DC soon after the shootings.  They concluded that Eric Harris, one of the two shooters, fit the textbook definition of a sociopath.    Having done my minor in psychology, I'm almost ashamed to admit that I never considered the connection.  Still, not having seen all the evidence myself, there was really no way I could form an educated opinion on the subject.  Here's what I'm wondering: why do we have to come up with some sophisticated (sounding?) psychobabble to explain the hateful thoughts of a scorned boy who was angry over feeling powerless? Although Eric exhibited a complete disregard for human empathy by killing several of his classmates, is he really a sociopath?  Could it be that he just wants to be the one in control; to have the kind of power the bullies at school had?  In one of his many audio recordings with Dylan Klebold (the other shooter), Eric says:    My parents are the best fucking parents I have ever known. My dad is great. I wish I was a fucking sociopath so I didn't have any remorse, but I do ... This is going to tear them apart. They will never forget it. I really am sorry about all this.  It fucking sucks to do this to them.   Now, on the surface, this seems to display a genuine sense of remorse for his plans.  Below the surface, however, I get the feeling that it's insincere, with the exception of the reference to sociopaths.  All this means is that while he's manipulating his parents into thinking he cares, he is really taking the opportunity to say what he really wants to be.  What if he idealizes the power that he feels sociopaths possess on the world?  Isn't it possible that he is just trying to manipulate his parents into thinking that he really  is  sorry for what he is planning?  He wrote in his journal:   I lie a lot.  Almost constantly, and to everybody, just to keep my own ass out of the water. Let's see, what are some of the big lies I told? Yeah I stopped smoking. For doing it, not for getting caught. No I haven't been making more bombs. No I wouldn't do that. And countless other ones.      So which is it, Eric?  Are you really sorry or is this just another manipulation?  The fact that you care enough to consider how your parents would feel, even if it's just another form of manipulation, shows that you care on some level.  Right there, we've betrayed the textbook definition of sociopath.  If you need yet more evidence, consider this:  Eric had to attend youth counseling after being caught breaking into a van and stealing things within it.  As part of completing the program, an essay was required to tell the administrators what had been learned and achieved.  Eric had this to write:   I am happy to say that with the help of this class, and several other diversion-related experiences, I do want to try to control my anger.   In his private journal, however, he said:   Isn't America supposed to be the land of the free? How come, if I'm free, I can't deprive a stupid fucking dumbshit from his possessions if he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van out in plain sight and in the middle of fucking nowhere on a Frifuckingday night. NATURAL SELECTION. Fucker should be shot.   Here's what I think.  Lying is just another form of power.  Psychologists call this phenomenon "duping delight".  Everything about Eric indicates to me that he was just a powerless kid who allowed his rage to consume him.  He frequently quoted Hitler and even planned the shootings for what would have been his 110th birthday; he desired the power and therefore idolized the man.  It's not that he completely disregarded human empathy, it's just that his thirst for power and attention completely devoured him.  Over time, his hate and need for power were fuelled by a symbiotic relationship with his growing ego and superiority complex until it completely boiled over with the deadly shootings at Columbine high school.  Like Hitler, Eric Harris took his own life.  Isn't a bit suspicious that he left behind such a detailed paper trail describing the very hate underpinning the framework for his plans?   He knew that his words would not only incite people into demonizing him as the powerful monster he wanted to be, but would also provide the bloody, indelible ink for the history pages.  It's all seems too deliberate.  Eric got what he wanted.  People think he is a monster.  I think he was a scared, frightened, powerless kid who's inability to function in society destroyed the lives of countless people around him, nothing more.

      Last Saturday, as I was preparing for my trip to London, I was listening to NPR when they announced that Reagan had died.  I was too young to notice the soaring 14% fixed mortgage rates or the debt ballooning 300% to  urlLink 2.6 trillion dollars  in the 8 years he was President, but I do remember the spirit that surrounded him.  There is no doubt about it, Reagan was a charming man.  It's hard to forget the laughter that erupted from the press whenever he was in front of a microphone.  And, unlike our current President, Reagan at times embraced his humility by  urlLink admitting  when certain high profile mistakes were made.  Despite this, as President of the United States, the buck stops with the executive.  Disavowing any knowledge of illegal covert operations does not excuse the fact that they occured in the first place.  Being charming is simply not enough.  Personally, I do not understand why many people hold Reagan in such high regard; the statistics collected during his presidency simply do not support the credit he receives.  Many argue that Reagan was the most popular president since WW2, but a close  urlLink inspection  of approval poll data simply does not support this claim.  Others argue that he is responsible for the booming economy of the 80s, but with a 11.5% unemployment rate in 1983, it also does not seem to be true.  Perhaps it was his effective drug policies that curbed cocaine use in the 80s; nope, not that either.  Reagan did have great hair, though.  Gotta give him kudos for that.

      Anyone who lives in New York City (or any urban city, I suppose) knows what a fitness craze a lot of people are on right now.  I've never been to a place where there are so many hunky guys and extremely hot girls   everywhere .  It all seems to fit consistently considering this city is Superficial Central.  Carrie's walk down the platform on HBO's  Sex And The City  inspired thousands of New Yorkers to drop what they were doing, rush to the nearest gym, shower, then high tail it to the nearest designer clothes store.  It's not at all uncommon to see people sporting Armani, Prada, Donna Karan, and Gucci gear taking their trash out.  Carrie just poured a little more fuel on an already burning fire.  I mean, we're talking highly combustible and incendiary stuff here.  The growing popularity of reality shows like The Swan indicate a disturbing explosion of interest in "making over" our bodies.  Fox doesn't mind the interest at all.  According to the Nielsen ratings, The Swan consistently pulled in roughly 11 million viewers each week, following their other hit show, American Idol, which did significantly better at 28 million.  Plastic surgeons don't seem to mind the hype either.  US News and World Report And World Reports estimates that Americans spent close to 9 billion dollars on plastic and dermatologic surgery last year alone.  Let me say that again: 9 billion dollars.  I wonder how much that Hooked On Phonics company made last year.  Are they even still in business?   I am simultaneously fascinated and frightened by this trend.  Who hasn't thought to him or herself, "I dont like this part of my body.  I would love to change it."  Well, now you can.  Lips not puffy and alluring enough?  No problem, here's some botulinum toxin.   And what about those extra pounds you packed on last Thanksgiving?  We can suck those right out of you.    Still, despite the exhilleration that comes along with instant gratification, some prefer to stay fit the old fashioned way, the gym for 50 minutes, 3 times a week.  That said, I do understand the entire psychology surrounding plastic surgery.  I just wonder what's next?  Gene manipulation for receding hair lines?  It's just a bit too Gattaca for me.

      A few days ago, I posted a  urlLink blog  on here about Michael Moore and censorship.  I still maintain that the republican controlled executive and legislative arms of government fervently try to  suppress  opinions that dissent from their collective agenda.  In spite of this, I wanted to make sure that there was some substantiated fact to support my claims.  Then I happened across  urlLink this article .  In it, Daschle asked the Bush whitehouse to explain the extra $600 billion dollars it was requesting for defense, driving the total cost of the defense budget up to $4.7 trillion dollars for defense over the next 10 years.  He states, "if we're going to commit those resources, and if we're going to commit those men, those women, those lives, then I think we've got to ask the questions that are required of us."    Of course, just asking the question was all that was required to get the conservatives fuming.  Senator Trent Lott cried: "How dare Senator Daschle criticize President Bush while we are fighting our war on terrorism?"  The article points out that Lott's selective memory is preventing him from recalling his own comments about President Clinton's policy in the Persian Gulf.  At the time, Lott stated,   "real patriots have a responsibility to question policies they believe to be wrong."    I guess that responsibility is only truly felt when your party doesnt control the executive, eh Trent?  As if Lott's rebuke wasn't enough, other republicans hopped on the "burn Daschle burn" bandwagon.  Ads ran in South Dakota, Daschle's state, showing pictures of Saddam with the caption "Why is America buying 725,000 barrels of oil a day from this man?" Next to a picture of Daschle with the caption "Because this man won't let America drill for oil at home."  Oh, I see, caring about the environment is now tantamount to aiding terrorists.     Getting back to my original point: criticizing people who raise questions about highly partisan issues not only undermines our ability to exist in a free thinking society, but sets a dangerous precedent to democracy.  People have a right to express their opinions (I think it says something about that in the first amendment), without being labeled "disgusting" by Tom DeLay.

      I'm having a really difficult time deciding if Jessica Simpson is completely brainless.  Or, perhaps more frightening, that she's not.  Jess is stirring up news lately.  The popstar antidiva is mad at an event promoter, 4 Dog Promotions, for cancelling a product placement endorsement at a race in Puerto Rico last October.  Apparently, Jess was supposed to wear a shirt with "MOTOROCK" plasered on it.  It's an auto racing company, that personally, I've never heard of -- that doesn't say much considering there's lots of stuff I dont know about cars, much less cars and  racing.  Still, it's not as if anyone would have noticed her endorsement between being blinded by the lights reflecting off the Moutain Dew and MSNBC cars whizzing by and putting mustard on a hotdog.  140k just for wearing a tshirt.  Score!    Now, this is not all that interesting.  The promotions guys didnt pay her, she has every right to be upset.  The question I have is: why do we care?    America has become socially obsessed with the ridiculous.  Jessica Simpson, launched to serious stardom with her hit show The Newlyweds on MTV.  Roughly 11 million people tuned in weekly to see Jessica and Nick unintentionally question the calculus of conflict in everyday life (relatively speaking anyway).  You might remember Jessica asking Nick "is this chicken, what I have, or is this fish? I know it's tuna, but it says 'Chicken by the Sea.'"  I mean, how great is that?  It's one of those times when you actually catch yourself questioning if it really  is in fact  tunafish, then quickly realize that you've allowed someone to bait you into something utterly ridiculous.    Curses! (in mock Gargamel voice)  I'm not sure I buy it.  I think there is a deliberateness to Jessica Simpson, which is reinforced and intensified by the fact that she epitomizes every blond stereotype we know we shouldn't have.  While watching, we ask with ourselves.  "is she really that stupid? what a blond.  but i know i shouldn't have stereotypes about blonds, so i shouldn't believe she's really that clueless.  but then again, what if she really is a total buffy?  does that mean i think all blonds are buffies?  wait no, that can't be right" ad infinitum ad nauseum....  And what is Jessica doing right as we ask ourselves these questions?  Well, she's only sitting on a pile of cash.  She even has a fragrance line coming out soon.  Hey, Glo worked for JLo (rhyming completely unintentional).  It has to work for her as well, right?  Maybe not...

      How ridiculous is Usher?  I mean seriously.  I've always liked his music, even back to his very catchy first hit single "You Make Me Wanna".  Recently (Friday to be exact), I was listening to Internet Radio on iTunes, which if you dont use, you should, when I heard his latest single Confessions, Part II.  Now, I only can take Usher so seriously as an artist, so I dont usually listen to his lyrics.  On Friday, however, I did.    Ok, rewind.    Usher was on Ellen Degeneres' show a week or two ago.  He performed the smash single Yeah.  I was impressed.  It was coreographed nicely and Usher was wearing nice gear, but in listening to the interview afterward, I lost all respect for him.  Here's what happened:  Ellen comments about how much she loves watching him dance (and seriously, he can really dance), and he responds that he dances for her and that (get this!) when he takes off his shirt and dances on stage, he's thinkin of her.  Ok, Usher, I'm not sure if anyone told you, or if you were still in diapers (you're all of 12, right?) that Ellen is gay.  Not only is it inappropriate and disrespectful to make prude and lascivious comments to women, but where do you come off doing it in your blinged out diamond chains and very expensive lip moisturizer in front of millions of people?  If you're going to prove that you don't think, at least try to minimize the exposure.    This is where I realized it.  We created Usher.  He's barely in his 20's, and he's livin the fabulous life that we're paying for.  Now, don't get it twisted here.  I definitely do not have a problem with people who are successful.  I do, however, take issue with people, especially entertainers, who seem to forget the people who bought the cds or bought movie tickets.  Usher has an  entire smooth operator image going on, but last I checked, Sade sang the song.  Ok, fast forward.  I hear Usher's new single on the radio.   In the middle of the song, he starts to talk in a "look at me, I'm sexy" voice and here is what he says:  This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do To tell you, the woman I love That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this And hopefully you'll give me another chance This ain't about my career This ain't about my life It's about us Please  Ok, does anyone else see the problem with this?  "I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this".  Nevermind the fact that I cheated on you.  Nevermind that I obviously didnt use a condom.  You should accept the fact that  I am man enough to tell you  that I'm a lying, cheating, bastard.    Usher, are you for real?

      I have to admit, I'm at a loss for words over all the hype the new Michael Moore movie is stirring in political circles.  His new movie, Fahrenheit 9/11 is apparently simultaneously provocative and chilling, so much so that Miramax, or more accurately, Disney refused to release it.  Why did they do this?  It's been reported that Michael Eisner, a man already in danger of losing his cushy executive job, personally blocked its release.  It was apparently too anti-dubya for Disney to justify its release, possibly risking millions of dollars in tax incentives in Florida.  Nevermind that it won Cannes film festival awards, this film is so dangerous that it had to be pulled.    Another thing, I don't know about you, but I for one am sick to death of hearing about the dissension (all of its forms) in Florida.  Between the much disputed 2000 ballot counting to Noelle Bush's (Jeb's daughter) predilection, and subsequent arrests, for anti-anxiety prescription drugs, I think the American public has had its fill.  Enough already!  *wipes sweat from forehead*  Anyway, back to the point.  I am beyond amazed at the preponderance of political censorship currently happening in the media.  This is not Michael Moore's first brush with censorship.  HIs first book, Stupid White Men, was blocked for months by Regan Books after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Regan Books decided that Moore's book was too controversial and critical of President Bush to be released.  I must admit, I'm not all that surprised by this.  Regan Books is a subsidiary of Harper Collins, which is in turn a subsidiary of News Corp.  What else does News Corp own?  You guessed it: Fox New.  Who owns all of this?  Rupert Murdoch.  Enough said there.  It just seems to me that people or groups of people who openly criticize Bush's leadership (or lack thereof) are labeled immediately as unpatriotic.  Everyday, I listen to Al Franken's show on Air America.  He routinely gets calls from people who tell him to start supporting our President because it's the right thing to do in times of war.  Despite the sour, lip puckering lemon that was sold to the American public, people still believe we should be supporting this meaningless search to find WMD's.  Hey Bush, why not use some of that 200 million dollar election campaign money you've hoarded to pay for some of the war?  Alternatively, how about using some of the 14.9 million dollars you earned from stealing land when you owned part of the Texas Rangers?  It kills me that given this gross injustice, the Bush administration actually has the audacity to use its position to not only create a war, but also censor those opposed to its agenda.  Our grandkids wont be able to pay off this war for "democracy".

      So my nifty friend  urlLink Yaron  turned me on to the idea of blogging.  Normally, I would think that blogging is for those 12 year old girls wishing to keep a modern day diary, but after reading some of Yaron's delightfully (or not) conservative views on the world, I decided to chime in with my two cents.  If you think I'm too liberal or on the left, well, I really just dont care.  This is for me.  All for me.  A little about me.  I'm a wall street drone.  I help develop derivatives software for a bank.  If you dont know what derivatives are, you totally rock -- I dont think anyone should have to know what they are. I enjoy working out, but have started to take it far less seriously. I love Whoppers from Burger King and can finish off a pint of ice cream on my own. I love putting on clean white socks and parking myself in front of the tv. There are constantly dishes in my sink that need to be done. I will let laundry pile up for 3 weeks and realize there will have to be a day where I wear old underwear and socks waiting for it to finish. I frequently forget where I am in the middle of a sentence, get frustrated that I cant remember what I was saying, then quickly change the subject to cover it up. I am constantly listening to music, mostly on my ipod, and singing along out of tune. It annoys me that all the yuppies in the world now own ipods and dont bother to change the distinctive white headphones to make it less obvious -- when did ipods become status symbols? Oh, people at work who try to use business buzzwords (leverage, utilize, weapons of mass destruction, and the like) in every sentence they say really irritate me. I like tv shows that make fun of white trash. I actually like tv shows that make fun of anything. I love the idea of being in love, looking at the manhattan skyline from the 59th street bridge at night, and especially walking down the street sharing a soda with a friend (the ones who dont mind my backwash anyway!). Im a gemini, so I'm moody (by default), but intensely loyal to the people who can put up with my shit and call me on it. I find the color blue soothing, but it has to be the right shade. I really enjoy listening to Smash Mouth and singing along. I love people who can finish my sentences with the exact same words I would have chosen.....oh, and Semi-Charmed Life is still one of the greatest songs ever.  So, that's me.

      CNN  urlLink reported  today that Jeffrey Jones, movie star from the clasic cinematic nuggets Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Howard The Duck was charged July of last year to probation after employing a 14 year old boy to pose for "sexually explicit" photos.  He was sentenced to 5 years probation and was ordered to register as a sex offender.  Problem is, he never registered, and now he's back in the news.  I read this and felt completely nauseus.  My first thought was, why was he only charged with 5 years probation?  Furthermore, why do the courts leave it up to the very people charged with crimes to register as sex offenders at all?  Then, why do we give any grace period whatsoever?  After leaving the sentencing, he should have made a direct line for the youth offenders division to fill out forms.  The very purpose of these laws is to make other people aware that laws have been broken.    I can understand Jones' reluctance to register.  He's the guy from Ferris Bueller, one of the greatest teen movies ever produced; helping kids everywhere understand that licking your palms is a surefire way to play hookie.  How cool would it be to have such a inexhaustibly determined principal trying to catch you?  In spite of all this, it was in the news last year that Jones had been arrested, and knowing the media's complete lack of compunction for reporting on sex offenders (especially famous ones), I would think he'd want to avoid more bad press and just get the registration thing over with.  He could have moved on with his life.  I dont think he should have gotten probation at all.  I think adults who ask 14 year old anythings to pose for explicit photographs should be put away somewhere where we can study and rehabilitate them.    Maybe I'm not so liberal afterall, eh?

      I came across this little blurb today, which I thought was kinda neat.  It puts an objective spin on the irrationality that can occur in relationships.  A Buddhist teacher once explained that there are three stages in the character development of human beings: dependent, independent and contributive. Unfortunately, most people are completely unaware of the third, the contributive (or interdpendent), state of life. For them, there are only two options, independence or dependence. Independence,the stand-alone self, can be a happy state because we are in control, a necessary condition of happiness. The strong confident self however, can easily become arrogant and isolated. But arrogance and companionship don't mix well. It is all too likely that an arrogant person willl be unable to sustain fulfilling relationships. Instead, those relationships will most often end in conflict and strife. The alternative for most is dependent (or codependent) relationships. People give respect and love, but not freely; strings are attached. This is the let's make a deal approach to relationships, "I'll love you as long as you give me what I need." Life in this sort of relationship can only be an emotional roller coaster, climbing to exhilarating highs and plunging into desperate lows. This is because your happiness is dependent upon another's behavior--upon his validation of your worthiness of being loved. Happiness in any situation can not be acchieved with out a sense of control. Depending upon another to validate that we are worthy of love gives that person control over our emotions and our self-esteem. We have given up our power.

      Coca Cola is a threat to national security.  Yes folks, today, CNN  urlLink reports  that the military has warned all personnel to be aware of the new Coca Cola cans being issued as part of a summer promotion.  These highly dangerous cans are equipped with GPS chips, which as we all know can track movement and eavesdrop on private conversations.  When does this bullshit end?  As the article points out, it's no different than the CIA making all that fuss over Furbies years ago because they could repeat phrases.  What exactly do they want us to believe?  That the Coke execs are sitting in some dark room, dimly lit only by cigars, marvelling in their ability to infiltrate and extract information from the most secure military installations in the country?  Wait, maybe Coke isn't limiting itself to GPS chips.  Maybe these execs are adding mind controlling drugs to their secret formula.  Think of the security threat if powerful people at Coke could actually control politicians.  They could control the world.  The possibilities are boundless.
