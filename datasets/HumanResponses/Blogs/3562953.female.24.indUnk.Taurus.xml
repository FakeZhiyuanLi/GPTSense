      After 13 or so posts I've run out of things to say. Truly sad.  Does anybody have any good music suggestions for me? I need new bands to listen to. I've been listening to a lot of the Autumn Defense, the Zombies and Wilco (no surprise there). But I know I'll get tired of it soon.   As I said before, the music stores I've been to recently have nothing in the way of interesting music. I did see a couple of Ed Harcourt CDs but I've never really heard anything from him. I wonder if I should take the risk?   Downloading is a bit difficult for me as well because I don't use a P2P program because Kazaa messed up our last computer and I have a phobia now of installing anything suspect so I just end up searching for "legal" downloads.   There's a lot of free music out there but it's really hit-or-miss.  urlLink Largehearted Boy  has an extensive list of music links everyday, and I've randomly downloaded some of his suggestions. The one that I've enjoyed the most is this band called  urlLink The Mountain Goats . They're an intelligent band that tell good stories. I suppose they're like Death Cab but not so sad. The other one I've downloaded was "Milking" by  urlLink Deerhoof , who seems to be the band  du jour  of the moment. I can't say I liked it. They're like a Japanese garage band, noisy guitars and distortion and a cute girl singer. I enjoy the occasional noise and fuzz but I just found her voice annoying. Not my cup of tea. But I've only heard one that one song so I could be totally wrong about them.  If you're interested in hearing either the Mountain Goats or Deerhoof you can download some tracks from the links below.   urlLink The Mountain Goats    urlLink Deerhoof

       urlLink CNN  calls "A Ghost is Born" the most eagerly awaited  weird  CD of 2004.    Wilco's music is, by turns, enigmatic, compelling, thrilling and absorbing. And it's often -- let's be honest here -- just plain weird.  urlLink    Good band, bad hair   Ahh, when are they going to start selling it here?! Music One and Tower are completely worthless. Worthless!!! Their selection of music is a joke. I hate you Music One and Tower Records! You don't deserve to be called music stores!  Okay, my one minute rant is over. Let's go back to the love.  From  urlLink IMDB :   Pop hunk Justin Timberlake has come to the rescue of troubled ex-love Britney Spears' career - by offering to write songs for her. The Cry Me A River singer, who is now dating Hollywood star Cameron Diaz, has offered to help Britney's flagging career after watching her suffer the heartbreak of having to cancel her tour.   As some people may know, my love for Justin is unfathomable, but I don't think resuscitating a career that should have ended in the last century is a good idea. Dating Cameron Diaz isn't so great either. Maybe he should just go help the misguided JC Chasez. That poor boy sure needs it.

      For the curious, you can see Rivers' profile on myspace  urlLink here . You don't have to be a member to see it.    urlLink    Isn't he adorable?   Okay, this is going to be one of the last posts that exposes my teenybopper-ness.   I love the music, dammit!

      Well, I sure had a good time at Fete last night even though the rain dampened the party mood (and caused the World Music stage to collapse) and Mel and I couldn't get into the reggae venue.   urlLink    Poor Radioactive Sago  It was like a huge reunion for everyone who went. People screaming "Hi!" and hugging each other while decked out in their hipster finest. I stayed mostly with my high school friends (plus  their boyfriends) and we spent a lot of time making fun of Mark, who I'm sure was the cause of the sudden downpour as a result of his singing. I suppose I was partly to blame because I requested that he belt out "Back for Good" by Take That to entertain us a little.    urlLink     Me, Mel, Genie the birthday girl, and Deng  I was a bit wary of having it in Eastwood because of the ridiculous price of beer. But I was lucky enough to run into people named Paolo because one Paolo gave me a stub for free beer and the other Paolo carried around a home-made alcoholic concoction (and he provided plastic cups). I spent absolutely nothing last night, except when my brother asked me for money. Phone jockey!  Ahh, I can't wait till next year for the next Fete. Maybe they can have it semi-annually or something. Can somebody start a petition?

      I came across this at  urlLink Pitchfork .   In the meantime, Rivers has utilized MySpace.com, a Friendster-like community website that allows members to upload pictures, music, and whatever (but at speeds much faster than the frustratingly slow Friendster), to circulate three solo acoustic songs. The tracks, which are free to stream but don't appear to be downloadable, appear alongside the sort of personal bio information you'd expect to see at a site like this, including the fact that Cuomo is a straight Gemini, "not a movie guy," and that his favorite TV shows as a child were Bob Ross' The Joy of Painting and The Guiding Light.    I remember Bob Ross! He used to paint trees with invisible squirrels! My old art teacher Carlos hated Bob Ross. I think he called him a hack.   I don't know if I'm going to run off to get an account at My Space just to see Rivers' profile but it sounds really intriguing. I think I'll sleep on it.  Oh oh oh! I met up with my friend who-shall-remain-nameless and we went shopping in Glorietta. We were in a some store that sold J.Lo and Tommy Hilfiger merchandise when she said, "Look, Weezer t-shirts." I thought she was just toying with my fragile Weezer obsession. But when I looked at where she was pointing, there were indeed Weezer t-shirts! In my size! I babbled incoherently for a few seconds, happiness taking over me like piss on a bed.   It was a good day. I still can't stop smiling.

      I take making mixed tapes (well, CDs now) very seriously. I think I got the bug from my dad. He’d list down all the songs in a notebook (with many corrections) and time how long they were so it would fit into a 90 minute tape so no songs would get cut when the tape ended. For me, I get kind of anal when it comes to the order of the songs. I re-arrange the songs over and over so the songs flow into each other smoothly, so it doesn’t jar whoever’s listening. Yes, I know that’s OC of me, but I really don’t have many hobbies.  I think my dad would have been blown away by the whole mp3 to CD burning phenomenon if he was still around. I can just imagine how excited he would be by fact that you can get any kind of music for free now.   I’m currently making my friend Mel’s Annual Birthday CD (hey, Mel!). She can come home from a crappy day at work and listen to my expertly mixed disc. I’m quite happy with this one. Apparently on the last CD, I made the grievous mistake of putting a Jason Mraz song. Mel, I am so sorry, I don’t know what I was smoking.   I’ve also had really good mixed tapes/CDs given to me too. Kitkat gave me a really interesting 2-tape mix of songs in high school for my birthday. I had to harass Mel into giving me a good mix of kinda sad and kinda sappy songs she had in her collection. But the best one I’ve received so far was from Eloisa (hi Eloisa!). The 2-CD mix has some really excellent stuff from bands that deserve more attention than their getting.   I don’t want to spoil Mel’s Annual Birthday CD surprise, but I’d like to share a song that I’ve included in the mix. The song is ‘Silence’ by  urlLink The Autumn Defense , a side project of Wilco bassist John Stirratt and new Wilco member Pat Sansone. It’s such a beautiful song. It reminds me of long lazy summer days. You may download it  urlLink here .   I came across  urlLink this  site, and today’s subject line, where people can show off their mad mixing skills. You might want to share yours too.

      If you've never heard of "Invader Zim" then you're totally missing out on one of the best shows ever. I can't begin to describe how funny and smart it is. It's too bad it had a limited run.   I love Zim's inept yet completely adorable sidekick Gir. My brother and I love yelling out quotes from the show for no reason. Dorky, I know, but it just makes me laugh.  "Gir! You're waffles have sickened me!"  Ha! I love it.                                  ***    urlLink The Stranger  has been one of my favorite things to read since my uncle sent me a copy in high school. So influencial was it on me, that I based my grad book write-up on it. Thankfully they have an online version, so I can get my weekly dose of inane-yet-insightful-and-somewhat-gay news.   They have this great feature called "Drunk of the Week". It's pretty self-explanitory. My favorite so far is  urlLink this one . That picture makes milk come out of my nose.

      Here's a review of Wilco's   urlLink A Ghost is Born   (from  urlLink largeheartedboy ).  Speaking of good music, I was watching "The O.C." last night and I nearly fell out of my bed when I heard "A Movie Script Ending" by Death Cab for Cutie in the background. That Ben Gibbard is a genius.  "The O.C." is already one of my favorite shows because Adam Brody is such a cutie and his character Seth makes me melt. I credit my friend, who prefers not to be mentioned *cough*Claude*cough*, as seeing him first. So she's got dibs on him.  Is it just me but doesn't the girl who plays Summer look like a slightly bad version of Mila Kunis from "That 70's Show"?

      My mom has recently become an NBA fan. I think she's suffering from withdrawal because there has been little to no tennis coverage in the past few months, and now she's taken to watching the NBA finals (go Detroit!). There's no use arguing with her over the remote control so I've had no choice but to watch it as well.  She doesn't really know how the game works. She doesn't know why they get fouled or the differences in points depending on where you shoot from. She'll just turn to me and ask "Why did they stop the game?" or "What's that timer thingie below?" And I of course would know the answers to these questions because I took notes in high school.   I remember we would have basketball as P.E. sometimes. Although, I really don't like basketball, I didn't think it was so bad because I was always relegated as a substitute, so I never got to play, which is fine with me. We were such horrible basketball players that the final score would usually be in the single digits. None of us could dribble well, no one could pass and there was lots of shrieking. Watching us play was so funny because it looked more like a wrestling match than a basketball game. Most of us got hurt. If someone had possession of the ball and there were people all around her swatting to get to it, more often than not she would curl on to the ground like an armadillo hugging the ball. We really played like girls. Really sissy girls.  Good times.  But enough of that. In a few weeks it’ll be Wimbledon and I’ll get to sit back and watch men in short white shorts chase a fuzzy yellow ball around. Ahh, that's the stuff.

      It was really nice to see the girls again. We find it hard to get together often because of people's conflicting schedules, that and Pilar being thousands of miles away.  It was fun to catch up with everyone and realizing that we are indeed older, but not much wiser.   Nina was missing in action because she overslept. Why am I not surprised? Bitch!    urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     I wasn't able to catch another French film. Too bad it ended yesterday. But there'll be a whole new bunch of foreign films to look forward too at Cinemanila soon.   Speaking of foreign film fests. Why do I always get stuck sitting beside people who insist on talking during the movie. It wouldn't be so bad if their comments were insightful or at least funny. But it always turns out to be some yokel making fun of people's names or reading the subtitles outloud. (I can read, thankyouverymuch).

      I almost got this template thing figured out. I spent most of Wednesday decoding and trying to understand what goes where. I did have a break in the afternoon to make a blueberry cheesecake (including the crust). It turned out pretty well. A little too soft, but it tastes like the real thing.  I had a college professor tell me once he knows girls from my high school are good at two things: making blueberry cheesecake and being excellent politicians' wives. So I got one down.  Anyway, I went to Greenbelt yesterday thinking it was the day of my lunch date with my college friends(it's actually today). So after cursing my ability to read properly I had an enjoyable lunch with Nina and took in a French movie as well. Might as well make the most of being in Makati. I hardly ever go there because I it makes me sad that I can't afford anything. Also, I never fail to get lost in Glorietta.   To be honest, I like hanging out in Cubao. I found "The Portable Beat Reader" there in Booksale for only Php110. It was a good day.

       urlLink    Run for cover    EEE!!! I'm so excited I could pee.   Oh no...  Wilco's new album is coming out on June 22 in the US. I hope they'll have it here but I'm not holding my breath. I've downloaded live performances of the new songs and my favorite as of now is "Theologians".   urlLink Here's  a link to some Wilco bootlegs.   This band is so good it hurts. I don't understand how awful, awful bands like Linkin Park can flourish spewing out bile and yet sell millions.  This is why I have so little faith in humanity.

       urlLink    It was a lovely wedding.    My friends Jopay and Bong got hitched last Saturday. I really wish them the best.   I was thinking that it was too early for either of them to get married since they're around my age, but as my brother pointed out, I'm 24 and that really isn't young any more.

      This is what joblessness and too much time on one's hands gets you.   Also, I guess I got a little envious of everyone else I know who have  urlLink interesting blogs  and I had to have one of my own. That and the aforementioned idle time.  So I guess that explains that.   I think I'll stick with this blogger provided template for the time being. I think it's pretty. And I have no idea how to make my own. All those tags intimidate me.

      Holy cow! Four posts in one day. Are you happy now?  Of course no music round up would be complete without mention of Wilco.  Wilco is releasing a picture book along with a CD of the unreleased recordings from  A Ghost is Born .    urlLink The 160-page book will feature contributions from, among others, author Rick Moody (The Ice Storm), artist Fred Tomaselli (paintings and stuff), and photographer Michael Schmelling (Spin, Wired), alongside archival material from Henry Miller (oversexed author of Tropic of Cancer, among others). Additionally, the band provides background to the book's images in the mode of long-form captions about such topics as touring and recording-- you know, all that band stuff that most of us know nothing about. Additionally-- and here's the really good news-- a full-length 40-minute CD of unreleased material will be included in the package.    So far they're calling it, wait for it,  The Wilco Book . Will I ever get my hands on it? To caress it lovingly and reading and re-reading it till the pages are tattered and dog-eared? *Sigh* It will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine.  And lastly, for Mel: "Show Me Love" by Robin S is currently playing on my computer. Pencil in on your calendar baboy dancing soon.

      Okay, this is officially the coolest thing ever: William "Captain Kirk" Shatner has a cover of Pulp's "Common People". How cool is that? Super cool, I tell ya.  From  urlLink Pitchfork : Captain Kirk-Hooker overreads the lyrics, inflecting so oddly that he alters their meaning and sounds grossed out by the idea of fraternizing with proles: "Are you sure... you want to sleep with common people?" Ewwww. But [Joe] Jackson's mighty handling of the peaks maintains the populist Priceline.com synergy. This Leonard-Cohen-as-Warped-Tour-game-show-host track deserves a listen; it's the funniest Britpop novelty since the Oasis rendition of "Wonderwall".    urlLink      I don't have a link to the song but I do have one  to the  urlLink original  by Pulp.

      From  urlLink Billboard  (via urlLink lhb ):  Cuomo chronicles the radical lifestyle changes he says led to a spiritual and musical "epiphany."   The shift came in the wake of Weezer's re-emergence with 2000's "The Green Album," which Cuomo says sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. But its 2002 follow-up, "Maladroit," "was not the big hit that it had threatened to be," after which Cuomo "fell into a life of ego and vice."   Doesn't that sound familiar? Isn't that what happened during the success of "The Blue Album" then the disappointing sales of "Pinkerton"? I guess Rivers didn't learn much from the experience before. Rockstars, yeesh. Oh, but there's more:  Cuomo goes on to describe how [Rick]Rubin introduced him to the love poetry of Hafiz and Vipassana meditation in February 2003. "In accord with my understanding of these teachings, I abruptly dropped all of my business responsibilities and hard-won power, and isolated myself once again," he says. "I fasted and lost 15 percent of my weight. I took a vow of complete celibacy. I gave away or sold most of my possessions, my house and my car and lived in an empty apartment next to Rick Rubin's house for the rest of the year. I moved to settle outstanding lawsuits and reconcile myself with enemies. I apologized to many people. I volunteered six days a week at Project Angel Food in Hollywood, preparing meals for people with HIV."   I hope to god he doesn't change his name to Ester. You know, like Madonna...forget it.

      I've been trying to stay away from the computer these few days because I did't want to abuse my pre-paid card. But I guess it's about time for an update.  I was quite a social butterfly this weekend. My standard of being a social butterfly though is very low. It basically means I went out of the house more than once this week to see people.  Friday was Mel's birthday. It was a girl's night out (when is it not with us?) at Xaymaca to see Brownman Revival. We got good seats (on account of being there at 8:30) and Mel's UP friends are a lot of fun. The only thing that ruined the night for me was the people standing behind us. I know they were only having some good clean fun but whenever the guys behind us would do the reggae version of the "woohoo!" which is "PRRRRRRR!!!" (where they would roll their 'r's), I would get sprayed with spittle. I hoped to God it was the beer that he was holding that was the cause of wetness, but I think it was spittle. Ugh.  We left really early (not because of the spit) seeing that Mel and I were blind from the dense cloud of smoke. It was so heavy I couldn't breathe. I don't know why people willingly kill themselves that way.  Anyway, on Saturday Tina cooked us very good paella and roasted chicken. Good food, good conversation and a lot of making fun of Genie's boyfriend (K-Zone = Gay-zone? Hee-larious!).  And yesterday I went to a wake. Not really fun but hey, I went out.  So that was my weekend.  Thanks for putting up with my self-indulgence post. I thought I'd reward you (yes, you!) with a link to  urlLink some live Deathcab for Cutie mp3s .

      I came across a good article about the celebrity as himself phenomenon.    urlLink What's interesting about the "as himself" cameo is that it's no longer just a gag—as it was when Frank Sinatra popped up as the piano player in 1956's cameo-studded Around the World in 80 Days. These days, the cameo has become a kind of product placement for celebrities. Just as characters routinely swig Diet Pepsi or drive Cadillacs in implicit product endorsements, celebrities are popping up in films to hawk the one product most crucial to their success: themselves.     I saw a movie yesterday that had Scott Baio (of  Charles in Charge  fame) playing himself and he was wearing a bright yellow spandex outfit. Disturbing. And to think, he used to date Pamela Anderson! Oh, how the mighty have fallen!  On a different note: I caved in. I have Kazaa. And now I'm staring at it blankly, not knowing what to download. The same thing happens to me at the music stores. It's like everything is laid out infront of you. The choices are endless. But I freeze like a deer blinded by headlights.   And I only have an hour left on my internet card!  Tina: Clive Owen is hot.  urlLink Many people agree with me . He was even hot in  Gosford Park !

      Yeah, me too.  &nbsp;  I just renewed my crush on Paul Rudd. He's been visiting the talk shows recently promoting  Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  starring the second funniest man over six feet tall, Will Farrell (the first, of course, is Conan O'Brien).  &nbsp;  Paul guested on Late Night at the same time  Clueless  was on HBO. Coincedence? Probably. But the fact that his cuteness is still on the same level as it was 10 years ago is pretty amazing.  &nbsp;   urlLink      That man is hot. And  urlLink Fametracker , a wonderful site that examines and decides how truly famous the truly famous should be, recently audited Paul Rudd's fame. They pretty much summed up my feelings towards him.&nbsp;    Let's set Paul Rudd up in a series of showdowns with more famous stars of all stripes, then decide which one is more likable, more talented and more appealing:  Ethan Hawke vs. Rudd: Rudd.  Vin Diesel vs. Rudd: Rudd.  Josh Hartnett vs. Rudd: Rudd.  Matthew Perry vs. Rudd: Rudd.  Ben Affleck vs. Rudd: Rudd.  Charlie Sheen vs. Rudd: Rudd. Rudd Rudd Rudd.  Colin Farrell vs. Rudd: Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuddddddd.   &nbsp;  They even mentioned my favorite Rudd moment in the movie  Wet Hot American Summer  (which I do all the time to annoy my mom):    His little temper-tantrum dance when Janeane Garofalo forces him to pick up his scattered lunch dishes. If you don't know what we're talking about, you must remedy that condition quickly.    So what are you waiting for? Go! Go&nbsp;buy a DVD of&nbsp; Clueless ! Go see  Wet Hot American Summer ! Go rent  Object of my Affection ! I've seen them all so I'm just going to sit here and twiddle my thumbs until  Anchorman  comes out.

      I saw the new Avril Lavigne video "My Happy Ending" recently and it seems like everyone's favorite rebel has decided to grow up. In Avril-world however, growing up means hiring a much older looking guy to cavort around with in music videos. My god, this guy looks like he's thirty-five and she looks all of sixteen. I know she's of age, but the sight of her in  bitin  skater pants and doesn't help her cause to be, in her words "like, more mature." Avril and gramps look so mis-matched that I imagine the cops busting in any minute and arresting him for corrupting a minor.   urlLink     All grown up.   You may think me an Avril-hater, but I'm really not. She's harmless enough and in a few years she will be but a distant memory, like NKOTB and MC Hammer Pants. I have to say though there are a lot of young and hungry grrrls out there ready to snatch the crown away from our skater girl. My favorite from the bunch is Ashlee Simpson, Jessica's sister. My guilty pleasure of the moment is her song "Pieces of Me". She sings pretty well, and I guess the reason why I like her is that she doesn't seem angsty at all. It's like she doesn't want to be the new Avril Lavigne, which I think is more reason for her to be the next Avril Lavigne.   That reasoning makes sense in my head.   I heard there's a Deathcab for Cutie version of "Complicated". If anyone out there is nice enough to find it and download it for me, I'll make you a cheesecake!

      I am really liking the new Black Eyed Peas song "Let's Get it Started", and I'm not ashamed to say it gets my boo-tay shaking. Actually, I like all the songs they've released so far, except for "Where is the Love?".   I don't know where this is going, but I just wanted it out there. I'm not thinking straight. I think it's weight of my foggy future that's affecting my psyche.   Anyway, while waiting for the next Weezer album to come out, fans can enjoy some mp3s straight from Rivers. His newest post is a special 4th of July cover of  urlLink The Star Spangled Banner . "Spangled" is a funny word.  I saw Sonic Youth recently on the talkshows. I'm not really familiar with their songs, since I'm not into the fuzzy distortion stuff, but I will probably download some of their  urlLink mp3s  that they've generously put up on their official site.   And last of my music musing for the day is news (from  urlLink lhb ) that Jacob Slichter, drummer for  urlLink Semisonic , has released his book of behind-the-scenes of being a rockstar. I've been reading his past journal entries on their website for a while now and he is very, very funny. My favorite rockstar moments was when they were on tour in Europe:  Down the autobahn we went through a frightening series of near collisions that, judging by the indifference of our driver, were entirely routine. My arms and legs grew heavy as we leaned into wide sweeping turns and then straightened out. The world distorted into a fisheye lens. Nausea appeared in the rearview mirror of my mind, gaining fast.   Finally, we pulled off the highway and rolled through the narrow streets of Cologne, pulling to a stop in front of a radio station. Everyone else got out. I remained in the van for several minutes, misty-eyed as I looked around at trees, grass, and flowers and reflected upon the miracle of life and all I had ever taken for granted.  If the book ever comes out here, I'll make sure to take some time and read it at the bookstore. Or get a friend to buy it.   Well, that's all for now. Toodles.

      She who puts up with my crap and my remote control hogging. She who sings without knowing the lyrics and eats peanuts on the bed. She who loves tennis if only for the cute guys. She who cooked an apple and squash soup that we will never forgive her for. Happy birthday to my mom!    urlLink    She's the groovy girl in the shades.

      Yesterday I finally had my hair dyed again, seeing that last year's red hair was edging off my head. My mom (after much nagging from me) did the honors again this year. I had a plan, and I thought it was a very good plan. I would have her bleach it first, and then apply the red dye so that the color would come out brighter. Good plan eh?   So when I finished waiting the requisite 30 minutes and washed all the red dye off and dried it well. I pull my hair back and it's...orange! Flaming bright orange. Like my head's on fire orange. Now I know what Anne Shirley felt like, except I don't have a church picnic to go to (go read the  urlLink book , it's wonderful). And green might have been a little cooler than orange.   urlLink    I guess it's not too bad. But I'm considering dyeing over it so it'll be just the right shade. Sounds like a good plan.

      The above subject is taken from my 1997 journal, the first week of July. Apparently, my life wasn't going too well then, despite the fact that Blur was on Letterman and our WYS website went up. I have no idea why I was having a bad week, I didn't really expound.  On the same week in 1996, I had gum surgery! I remember that. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. And in the week of July 5-11 of 1999, I bought a Sebadoh CD, saw  The Graduate , ruined my mother's birthday, and saw some films at Cinemanila.  While it may seem like I keep my journals up-to-date, I am a horrible diarist (is that even a word?). My 2003 journal has around ten entries for the whole year. And it's not that I had a boring year, lots of shit went down, it's just that I'm too lazy to write it when it happens. My 2004 journal isn't fairing any better. We're mid-way through the year and I have around three pages. Pathetic! But then again, I have this blog, so I can print out some entries and pass it off as legitimate memories.   Here's a little poem my friend Ana Esposo wrote in 1996 about our other friend  urlLink Tina :  Super feeler  tina weena is a super feeler the true and real feeler the only feeler there shall be only one. only one? I said to you. Why not two you say to me and a to you.  Man, that is deep. Good times.  While I'm on the subject of my high school years, here's a few links to some songs I liked way back when (all the tracks are live versions, I think):  urlLink Blur - Song 2    urlLink Sebadoh - Not A Friend   urlLink Weezer - Tired of Sex  (right click on the link and then select Save Target As)

      My friends and I were 15 when we saw  Before Sunrise . Aw man, we swooned over that movie like school girls (which we were, so back off). My favorite part (like everyone else I think) was when they commissioned a poet to write them an impromptu poem.   Daydream, delusion, limousine, eyelash  Oh baby with your pretty face  Drop a tear in my wineglass  Look at those big eyes  See what you mean to me  Sweet-cakes and milkshakes  I'm delusion angel  I'm fantasy parade  I want you to know what I think  Don't want you to guess anymore  You have no idea where I came from  We have no idea where we're going  Latched in life  Like branches in a river Flowing downstream  Caught in the current  I'll carry you  You'll carry me  That's how it could be  Don't you know me?  Don't you know me by now?   Well, Linklater decided that the two lovers should meet again, nearly ten years later so now we have  Before Sunset . The film is getting positive reveiws, like  urlLink this  one from the Stranger.  I'm really curious how their second day together will go, but I suppose I have to revisit  Before Sunrise  again to remember everything.

      Well, I was wrong. Sharapova took the title away from Williams. It was a pretty exciting match. Sharapova just taking the carpet from under Serena. And it wasn't so much that Serena self-destructed as she is sometimes wont to do, but Maria was just wizzing the winners past her.   Unfortunately, I was right about the outcome of the Ancic/Roddick semifinal. Roddick won in four sets. Mario Ancic put up a good fight against Roddick, tumbling around the court like a young Boris Becker.   Anyway, I'm looking forward to tonight's final with Federer and Roddick. I hope Roger crushes him in straights sets.

      Wimbleton is almost finished and it's mostly come down to the usual suspects. Serena is sure to take the title, but I know my friend Pao is happy enough that Maria Sharapova is in the finals. I think it's unfair that some people compare her to Anna Kournikova. Sharapova is obviously a better player (having won tournaments already compared to Kournikova's goose egg), and she's far better looking too. And perhaps even blonder.  I want Roger Federer to win so badly. I hope it'll be a really interesting final between him and Roddick. The semifinal results haven't come it yet but I think it's safe to say it'll be those guys in the finals. Of course, if Mario Ancic is able to upset Roddick, that's just fine with me.  Ancic is my mom's new boy toy. She replaced Gustavo Kuerten with him because she doesn't see "Guga" anymore. My mom's only reason for watching tennis is the cute guys. Hey, that was my reason too!  Ancic is 20 years old and is Croatian but he looks really Latino. I've only seen him play once or twice, but he seems to be extremely talented and I'm sure he'll be everywhere sooner or later. Let's hope he doesn't have a penchant for vodka and the ladies like Marat Safin does.  urlLink     Oooh, what if Ancic and Sharapova get together? That's so cute. Mario and Maria sitting in a tree. Aww...   Okay, I'll shut up now but I shall leave you with a link to a song by My Morning Jacket called " urlLink Heartbreakin Man ". NU107 has their song "One Big Holiday" on their current playlist. Gasp, does this mean NU is getting back to their former state of quality? I guess not because I also heard them play Katy Rose's song too. Ugh. NU, I used to love you!

      I would like to share with you (all four of you who may or may not read this blog) a little song called "Halfway to a Threeway". It's by  urlLink Jim O'Rourke , who is a member of Sonic Youth and who produced Wilco's excellent album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. This song is one of the most beautiful and sickest songs I've ever heard. I think it's supposed to be a little humorous but it still comes off as being seriously creepy. Here's a little excerpt:  I tried again and again  To indulge in just one sin  All you have to do is lie there  While I push aside your wheelchair   And I do everything it takes  To change your mind and apply your brakes  So I know that you can’t roll away  ’Cause I’m halfway to a threeway   And it gets worse:  I just can’t get you to sit  You and your stupid epileptic fits  And I know that you can’t run away  ’Cause I’m halfway to a threeway   As I lay you down on my bed  It don’t matter that you’re brain dead  I can get so you close to ya  Now that you’re in a coma   Ain't that sweet? I haven't heard any of Jim's other stuff but from his discography alone, he's quite a prolific musician and producer. I'm most interested in hearing his band Loose Fur, which also includes Wilco members Jeff Tweedy and Glenn Kotche. So  urlLink here's  the link to the song for the curious.

      Good news to all who missed Late Night's 10th Year Anniversary Special. If you've been watching Conan recently then you would know that they've just released two new DVD's (the 10 year special and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog's Best Of). I already saw the Anniversay Special, thanks to my Conan-loving cousin  urlLink Nicole , who was wonderful enough to send me a copy. But I'm still interested in seeing the extra features and footage.   One of the best clips from the Anniversary was when Andy got Conan really mad. Man, you don't want Conan angry! You won't like him when he's angry!   Funny stuff.  If they included the Walker Texas Ranger lever with the DVD, it would make a good thing only sweeter...for me to poop on!

      I caught the  urlLink Mutual Admiration Society  on Conan a few nights ago. The band was composed of the lead singer of  urlLink Toad the Wet Sprocket  and members of  urlLink Nickel Creek .   Seeing Glen Phillips again brought back some memories. Like one of  urlLink Tina's  recent blog entries, I also remember those lazy, hazy days of high school. Specially our senior year, because after I got my acceptance letter from UP, I completely stopped taking notes or listening to the teacher. Tina, Criselle and I, because we were seated at the backmost row, would just read magazines or take naps. Yeah, we were bad girls. Or at least we tried to be.  One of the songs I really remember from that time was Toad the Wet Sprocket's "Come Down". Glen Phillips was such a cutie and he would sing without any shoes on. It was his thing!   Anyway, it was nice to see he's still working.   As for Nickel Creek, my brother and I were listening to them in the car radio. We had a conversation that went something like this:  He sneers: Hey, isn't that Stephen Speaks? Me: No, that's Nickel Creek. Two different bands. They just came up at the same time. Paul: They sound the same. I thought you hated Stephen Speaks? Me: I do, but that's Nickel Creek. Paul: So isn't that the same thing? Me: No, Nickel Creek is a little better. They have a mandolin player and they cover Wilco songs. So they're cooler. Stephen Speaks is not cool. Paul: But they sound the same!  Me: They are not the same! Paul: Stephen Speaks lover!  There's no agruing with that logic.

      Because the times they are a-changin'.  I have a job. Yes, a job. No more sitting on my ass at home and eating potato chips. It doesn't pay much (in fact, it pays shit). But I know I'm going to learn a lot and I think I can get along with the people there. So get off my back!!!  I really had to think very hard about accepting it because of the aforementioned small pay. I made up my mind that I wouldn't take it but after a long sleepless night, the next morning I changed my mind. Weird. I think I had one of those dreams where "the truth" dawns on you and everything makes sense, then of course in the morning you remember nothing.   (You ask, how can you have a dream and have a sleepless night? That's impossible! You're just making it up! Liar! Yeah, well, get off my back!!!)  Wish me luck, pray for me, burn some incense for me, kill some chickens for me, anything would be okay.  Ooh, Kristine's a big girl now.

      Some disturbing news from  urlLink ETOnline :  "Taps" will be playing for one of the characters when "CSI: Miami" returns for its third season on Monday, Sept. 20, at 9 p.m., on CBS. The cast and the crew were sworn to secrecy as to whom they will be laying to rest, but since ET was behind the scenes and spoke to star David Caruso, we are betting it is not him. Damn! Man, if they were going to kill off anybody my choice would have been David "Scene-chewer" Caruso. Here's a picture of the funeral.   urlLink     Red-headed freak: check. Tweetums blone: check. Token ethnic actor: check. Cutie Slater boy: Hey...waitaminute!  I was willing to give this show a chance just to see Rory Cochrane on a weekly basis, but now they can keep their damn spin-off!

      I've been watching American baseball from time to time but only when The New York Yankees and the Florda Marlins (the two teams from last season's World Series finals) are playing because 1) I only recognize players from these teams and 2) that Derek Jeter is a babe.  From  urlLink lhb :   urlLink Name That Tune in MLB...  You're out at a big-league ballpark, and you hear a few seconds of some song as the batter steps into the box. Immediately, you find yourself wondering, "What the heck was that song?" or "Who sings that tune again?"  Most players prefer hip hop stuff like Eminem (Jeter and Carl Pavano) or 50 Cent (my favorite player Miguel Cabrera). But the best one I thought was Yankee Hideki Matsui's choices of Coldplay, the Beatles and the Who. How adorable is that? And since his nickname is Godzilla, the music people will also play the theme for him.  I know tennis players also have music when they come out. I remember one time Yevgeny Kafelnikov came out and the music they played was Bon Jovi. Oh lordy. I forgave him for that since he's Russian and they really don't know any better.

      Do ever get this immense feeling of dread whenever you remember a conversation you had with a person important to you (like a prospective employer or crush) and you think you said some incredibly stupid things that keep replaying over and over in your mind like a rash that won't go away and maybe days later you forget about it but you see or hear something that makes you remember it all over again and you want to purge the thought by banging your head against a wall repeatedly?  Yeah, me too.

      I'm happy to know I've changed some people's lives (even just a little) through sharing my favorite music with them. I had a long talk with someone who prefers not to be named *hack*Claude*cough* about the catch 22 of our current similar situations. And she told me that whenever she felt particularly down about something she would listen to the CD I gave her! Aww! That makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!   You're welcome girl-who-doesn't-want-to-be-mentioned-in-my-blog!  And because I'm in a somewhat good mood today here's a link to a wonderful cover of Britney Spears's "Toxic" by some guy named Michael Gum. Yeah, I've never heard of him either but his version is truly heartbreaking. Download it  urlLink here  (right click then choose "Save Taget As...). And  urlLink here  is a link to his Live Journal.

      I came across this site called  urlLink Paradise Engineering  while trying to find the lyrics for "Common People". It's a site that promotes future paradise, hedonism, and drug use (because as we all know it's impossible to be truly happy without some chemical assistance). All that and it hosts mp3s to some songs by REM (It's the End of the World as We Know It and Nightswimming), The Monkees (The Last Train to Clarksville), and They Might Be Giants (Birdhouse in Your Soul), to name a few.   Here's a little quote from their intro page:  The Hedonistic Imperative predicts we are poised to explore a spectrum of outrageously beautiful states of consciousness. Potentially, states of consciousness far more sublime than today's fleeting "peak experiences" can become part of the texture of everyday life. The advent of utopian biotechnology permits our genetically enriched descendants to be animated by gradients of immense well-being - in contrast to our animalistic mix of pleasure and pain. In the new reproductive era of "designer babies", gradients of innate bliss can form the bedrock of invincible mental health.  Okay...  I've been reading some Isaac Asimov lately and this is the kind of thing he writes about in his novels about the future. He doesn't mention any "spectrum of outrageously beautiful states of consciousness" but apparently there's some kinky robot sex in our future.   If you don't want to search through pages and pages of new age quotes and pretty pictures of beach scenes and horses in the mist,  urlLink here's  the page of the mp3s.
