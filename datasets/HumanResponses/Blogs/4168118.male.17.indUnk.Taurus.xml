      ok ok .. today`s plan was supposed to eat , play arcade and catch the movie AVP(aliens vs predator) but obvousely some fuck nuts have to screw it all up ... ok ok was being childish when i left the train at kallang and came back half way ... so they decided to go bugis and play arcade but gerald was not allowed as he was under 16 ... so he had to stand out side and watch them play , then went to have lunch , we left there and waited for samuel this is where te trouble came ... everyone started unable to make up their minds for some reason , samuel said he "watched" the movie (which we tested him by asking he ending which he couldnt ans) and said it was lame wtf ! just as river from tgp one said... "If you want to disprove any or many aspects of well-founded scientific knowledge, every person on the planet is free to do so with research that shows the earlier work is limited or false. If someone says, "I think this house is haunted", they should say exactly what this means, and how precisely they have just disproved vast subdisciplines of biology and physics"(in shorter terms do no buy any thing they have said see it for ur self) ... they continued not making up their minds and gerald left (oops u guys just hit the treshold) ... tried to persuade him back but no avail , so we left for orchard road and went far east plaza saw a gal in gothic and casper made a fool of himself there when the shop owner told him off when his hands begain to itch wahaha... went lido cinema again still they cant make up their fucking minds , samuel wants to watch "quill" which is about the story of a fucking dog (oh please i rather be thrown off the building than to watch the show!) , casper wants to watch either AVP or twin effect, peck wants to watch twin effect which is full of stupid looking props and special effects that look like they paid some monkeys to do the  job  ...as for me i sticked to the plan watch APV ... they also gave some suggestions like sneaking in into some nc16 show which obviousely u need to be 16 before entering the shows are ferenthight 911 (which i rather watch the news) , open waters ( which i rather go home and watch  porn ) and colleteral (obviousely some of them are underage) .. end up no movie ... so samuel decided to see girls playing billard  *edric still pmsing *peck has be trying to avoid responsibility the whole day *sa-mule has been trying to give lame suggestions the whole day like the fuckin jap dog movie and threatens to go home *caspa cant make up his mind *gerald damm tu lan ... *nice fucking day.. *this script shd be put to nc-16(exceive vulgular language)
