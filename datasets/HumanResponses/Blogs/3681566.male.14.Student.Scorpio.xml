      Blah...I've been really tired lately. I have been getting to bed around 2 o'clock in the morning for the last week. I'm working on a secret project for Admin Central :-X *cough*  website  *cough* I never said anything.  I have just found a host, which was one of the hardest tasks of my life. That is all that I'm going to tell you.  PBv4 is one it's way. Really close. I mean really. I can't wait. I'm going to go do a victory dance on my front lawn when it is released!  G'day to yall!

      Whew, I have been really busy the last few days. Our end of the year party was a no-go, mostly due to our good buddy being suspended, for, some reason, it doesn't really matter. That did not make me happy, but, what can you do? Summer has started and I'm already bored as hell! Maybe I'll give Jason a call and see if he wants to go golfing, or out to the driving range. Well, see ya'll later, probably, unless I get really busy agian!  Mike

      Today was "officially" the last day of school. I had my last exam today, and was deeply saddened that I would not beable to see most of my friends over the summer. I may call up my good buddy Jason and see if he wants to go golfing next week. Personally, I hate golfing, I find the game pointless. You are expected to hit a little ball so far and land in the place that you want it to. Right, the only thing that ends up where I want it to is my driver in the pond! The beginning of the summer is horrible for me. I wasn't home for 3 hours today before I was bored out of my mind! Imagine what I am going to do over the summer. Yeesh! Well, it's only 7:18, and time is going by so slowly! Maybe I'll go for a walk, and that can be the highlight of my day!  Mike :P

      I finally figured out how to use it! Pretty simple. Anywho, I guess I will use this to sorta introduce myself!  I am Mike, but alot of people either call me Mikey, or Mikkeey. I am 14, and live outside of London, Ontario! You probaly would have been directed here from either a Proboard or Student Center.  The best thing that ever described me was this personality test that I took. It sounds exactly like me:   Sevens use their mental intelligence to create a positive spin on life by coming up with various utopian possibilities about how things could be. They can be very inspirational as they assert their utopian ideals about how people can live better lives or make the world a better place. Robin Williams is a well-known Seven, and his character in the movie Dead Poets Society is an excellent example of this. By regularly imagining how things can be good or made better, Sevens tend to be very optimistic, and their optimism gives them the confidence to assert themselves in the world, going after whatever it is they want   Well, today I am basically going to sit on my ass all day, maybe eat some chips, or get a pop. I have an exam on Monday, so I might do some of the review sheets our teacher handed out. Either than that, I am going to see Harry Potter 3 tonight, and I might go see the Terminal (starring Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones).  See y'all around, MIK3Y

      Well, this is my first post in this blog, and I really haven't figured out how to use it yet, I bet it is really simple, yet, it would still be difficult for me. When I have it figured out, I will post more!  Cheerio!

      I finished my first placement at Byron Day Camp. Yeesh, what a group. We went and saw "Around the World in 80 Days". Great, I thought to myself. A busload of screaming kids, and then as we headed up to the movie, I exclaimed to my fellow LIT, "Great, first it was a bus full of screaming kids, now we can have a theatre full of them". My experience there was great though, I met some awesome people and had a wicked time. Well, I've been really busy lately, not really an excuse for not posting, but what the hell... &nbsp;

      This week I am in the LIT program for the City of London Recreation and Neighboorhood Services program. LIT, you might ask? Lost in Translation for me, Leader in Training for everybody else. This is the first of two steps to becoming a qualified counciler for the City Daycamp programs! I have volunteered the past two years for the City of London and also the YMCA. My aim is to become a teacher when I am older, so hopefully this will help me accomplish this goal!  Well, I haven't been on the net for about 2 days now. I have only been on for about 30 min/day. Scary for me. I just sorta ran out of things to do. Temporarly that is.  Mike

      Three more days until I leave for Florida. Buyah! Yippee! Cha-Ching! At least I don't have to worry about Admin Central anymore. I still like to go back there once and awile to lock some threads, warn some members, you now, like I'm a control freak, except I wouldn't call it that. I'm packing my bags tonight. I printed of a PHP Tutorial that I can read on the drive down. Too bad I didn't have a laptop, or I would work on some codes and my website. Well, I am taking some movies, and my PS2 down. Maybe that can help me get through the two weeks. I am going to miss my dog and rabbit. I will post a pic of them this week. Maybe Wednesday, possibly, if I can find 5 minutes to take a picture, upload it, copy the URL, and post it here. I'll do that.  ยง33 ยฅ@, Mike

          urlLink http://ccc.1asphost.com/xnews   I have just posted our Month's Special: "Canada Camera". I urge you to check it out! Be amazed, and get a good laugh.  Number of posts posted on PB Support in the last 2 days: 107. Amazing, at least my personal opinion.  I'm leaving for Florida in 4 days now. I'm getting excited. Antsy almost. Well, better go see if I can "up" that post count.  *Mike*

      Well, 10.8 MB worth of crap is what it was. I stuck with my original idea of XNews and found a new host.  urlLink http://ccc.1asphost.com/xnews . Simple design. It took me a total of 4 hours to do the WHOLE thing! Half of that time was looking for a host. I got a new bike too! A good one! It looks awesome, and rides good too. Me and my rents went over to Sport Mart last night. I really like that place. I bought all my back-to-school clothes there. Plus, they know us now. I really liked this pair of pants, exept they where $69.99. I asked him if he was serious, and he said maybe he can lower the price $20 under there "clearance policy". So he did. I probably have spent $500 dollars there now. Everybody, if you live near a Sport Mart, or Sport Check, GO THERE NOW!!!  5 days until I leave for Florida. Better bring my raincoat!

      Yeesh. I stayed up until 1:30 last night on Proboards Support. I got up at 9:30 that morning. A 16 hour day! Veryt tired, but I am already creating my 2nd website (aside from XNews). I think it is going to be a blog, that everybody can use, much like Blogger.  But I have some good ideas that is going to separate it from all the others. Only 1 more week until I go to Florida! Sun, Sand, and well, and PS2! I might be going and getting a bike tonight. The last new bike I got was when I was 6. Sad almost. I am currently download 10.8 MB worth of blogging software, so I expect to be on the interent most of the day. Yipee! I'll keep you posted.  Mike

      Great, just lovely! This is all that I need, honestly. 38 wonderful new messages, fan mail I hope. LOL. Well, Admin Central is gone, out of my power! I gave up the position of head admin on Saturday. I needed some time away, plus, I am creating my new website, XNews:  urlLink http://xnews.000k2.com/phpnuke/index.php . I'm hoping that it can be finished by the time I go to Florida. If anyone wants to contribute, you can read the first message on the main page!  Anyways, I was going to say something.....I forgot. Damnit. Well, farewell for now!  ..::``Mike``::..

      Well, I finished the LIT Program, and had a fun, enjoyable time, and met some totally awesome people. I am probably going to take LIT 2 in the fall, so I can become a leader for the city next summer. Among other things I am now persuing is a soccer referee for the Byron Optimistr Club, and a speaker/presenter for Pillar. For Pillar, I would go around to different schools and show them a presentation on how to become a volunteer! Exciting stuff! I now have 2 weeks to relax, and then we are going to Florida for the last 2 weeks of summer! Go get a tan, and look for some t-shirts are my goal. I finished shopping for clothes last weekend. I got these awesome shoes, and some cool pants ($69.99 mind you). So, I've been happy lately, and thats all that matters!  Mike :-P
