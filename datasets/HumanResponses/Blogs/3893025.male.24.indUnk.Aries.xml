       I f there's any piece of music in the world that should be listened to, regardless of what one normally listens to, it should be Gorecki's Symphony Number 3  also known as the Symphony of the Sorrowfull Songs, the "Symphony" (as it will be reference from hereon in) is an hour of dark, sorrow-filled music.  I first heard it on a commute home from work. I was scanning through the stations, since they all suck, and I came across NPR playing the third movement. I couldn't bring myself to change the station and as soon as I got home and put the car into park, I jumped on iTunes and found the symphony and purchased it.  The lyrics of the three movements of the symphony are composed of three separate but equally sorrowful subjects.  The first movement is based on a 15th century Polish poem called the Lamentation of the Holy Cross in which Mary begs her dying son to speak to her.  "The second movement is based on a message found scrawled on prison cell wall in 1944 by an 18 year old girl Helena Wanda Blazusiakowna  The final movement is based on folksong, a mother searching for her son (source:  urlLink A Good Music Guide Review ).  The full text of the three movements is as follows:   1. Lento - sostenuto tranquillo ma cantabile   My son, chosen and loved, Let your mother share your wounds And since, my dear son, I have always kept you in my heart, And loyally served you, Speak to your mother, make her happy , Though, my cherished hope, you are now leaving me.     2. Lento e largo - tranquillissimo   No, Mother, do not weep, Most chaste Queen of Heaven Help me always. Hail Mary.    3. Lento - cantabile semplicez   Where has he gone, My dearest son? Killed by the harsh enemy, perhaps, In the rebellion. You bad people, In the name of the Holy God, Tell me why you killed My dear son.  Will I have his protection, Even if I weep My old eyes away, Or if my bitter tears Were to make another River Oder, They would not bring back My son to life.  He lies in the grave I know not where Though I ask people Everywhere Perhaps the poor boy Lies in a rough trench Instead of lying, as he might, In a warm bed.  Sing for him, Little song-birds of God, For his mother Cannot find him. And God's little flowers, May you bloom all around So that my son May sleep happily.

      Although I'm not too big a fan of the city of Los Angeles, I do appreciate its long and diverse history. The ACLU, however, appears to want to remove a tiny portion of Los Angeles' history by threatening to sue the county (or city since it's both) in order to force it to remove a cross that appears on the county's seal.  I'm all for secularism. I don't think any religion should be expressed outside of the home. Religious expression in public presents too many problems because too many people have too many differing beliefs. I think we Christians should keep our crosses at home and everyone else should do the same with their religion, Jewish, Muslim, hippie, whatever they are. In any event, the ACLU obviously has nothing better to do than to catch a tiny little cross on the county's seal and to make a big deal out of it.  Often times I wonder who really is doing all this bitching. The whole of America's traditions seem to be changing due to one occaisional person bitching about something. The ACLU shitting themselves over the pledge of allegiance because some bonehead thought that because he was uncomfortable with it, the other 280 million or so Americans shouldn't even be given the option to say it makes me wonder what will continue to happen to our traditions because of the occaisional whiner. Hello, sir, some of us are still patriotic to our country. Some of us do more than pledge allegiance to the flag every day.  This is insulting.  This reminds me of the Associates Press' report about American History dissappearing before our eyes... well, before the eyes of school-age children. In a nutshell, all history being put into texts these days is negative propaganda as opposed to a mix of America's good accomplishments as well as her bad. Since most people don't care to venture beyond what they're told and think for themselves, stuff like this is what makes radical liberals that decide the ACLU is their best friend.  It seems that we've venturing more and more into collectivism. Or at least we're letting outselves do so, well, not so much 'we' because I'm bitching about it constantly.  I suppose you can say that little changes don't really matter, and I suppose this is alright unless you take into account that a bunch of little changes in order to keep a few people happy can result in one BIG changes.

      Welcome to Spring in Nebraska. The wonderful things that pressure differences can bring to one's life are countless.  In any event, the weather's been fairly nasty over the past few days, this weekend. There was plenty of havoc reeked in the south where an entire town was destroyed but hey, that was 80 miles or so south of us here in Omaha.  Until today.  If you're ever given the chance to commute 25 miles into a strong Midwestern storm during a tornado watch, I strongly advise against it.  As I left work, I noticed the skies to the south were grey, but to the north, in Omaha, the skies were black. The closer I got to the Kennedy Freeway-I-80 Interchange, the more apocolyptic the weather began to get. Sitting, stuck on the 75-80 Interchange, the radio was interrupted by the infamous Emergency Broadcasting Service's warbling tone, followed by an oh so 'oh shit' message warning of a tornado warning (as opposed to a watch which is where we'd been all day long) roughly five miles south of my apartment in Sarpy county (and approx. 10 miles southwest of where I was sitting trapped in traffic). Apparently cloud rotation had already been observed.  Wonderful, I though -- keep moving and get home ASAP.  So, averaging about 25 miles per hour on the Interstate, I begin pushing my way home trying to avoid whatever mother nature's planning on bringing to Omaha. Then it happens. The winds begin to pick up, the car begins rocking, the rain begins to pour and I can hardly see.  Keep going, only a few more miles left.  Then the hail starts.  Get off the freeway and onto surface streets -- hey, if worse comes to worse, at least I can run indoors if I need to, right?  So I escape the freeway only to find that the surface streets are flooded and littered with disabled vehicles.  As I stop at a red light, one of the four horeseman of the apocolypse pulls up.  He waves and moves on, the light is green and my day's getting worse.  More hail, more rain, less visibility -- shit. Keep moving, I'm almost home.  As I turn off of the main road onto the side street that leads to my apartment, the hail stops and the rain begins to let up. The sky is now grey as opposed to black.  By the time I arrive at my apartment complex, the rain has stopped and the sun is peeking through -- just my luck.  One nice close call for me, though, as this was too close for comfort for me. Work had already issued a duck-and-cover due to a tornado that never touched ground (thank goodness) headed towards the base.  It's these little things that make life interesting....

      So, apparently we were hit here pretty hard in the good ol' Husker State of Nebraska. I enjoyed having my lights flickering off and on as OPPD's power grid was thrashed by the wind and rain. I just disregarded and went to sleep. About 3 in the morning, however, I awoke to a bright flash of lightening followed shortly by the loud clap of thunder -- the thunder was so loud that it actually my bedroom actually shook and car alarms were set off. In the morning I noticed some of my picture frames were off-center. Gotta love Spring in the Midwest.

      The  urlLink BBC  has an interesting  urlLink article  about Medicaire paying for stomach-shrinking surgery...    I used to be  fat , so I can get away with commenting about it.  I used to be  very  fat, as a matter of fact.  At 14 I weighed 300 pounds.  Now, at 24, I weight about 170.       I understand that for some few individuals, stomach-shrinking surgery is the only option for losing weight. It is, however, not the only option for every overweight and obese individual skulking around America (especially Nebraska, home of the fat girl).     I don't want my taxes to pay for people to get surgery to lose weight. That's about as bad as my California taxes going to pay for abortions (although now I'm exempt from paying California taxes and Arnold can kiss my hairy, sweaty, English-speaking, natural born ass).     As I said before, I used to weigh 300 pounds. I didn't need surgery to lose weight. I needed to stop eating so much food. I needed to stop drinking so much pop and eating so much candy. I was a vegetarian for six years, as a matter of fact. Now, I go out every morning and run 2 to 4 miles before work and on nice Saturdays, I head over to Iowa and run 6 or so on the  urlLink Wabash  trace.  When I want a pop, I drink diet -- you eventually get used to the flavor if you're not of the mindset that you  need  sugar. Fruit tastes pretty good, you know, and it doesn't cause your teeth to fall out of your head. Plus it help you to go to the restroom. Meat's good, once and a while, but you won't die if you don't have it three meals a day, seven days a week. When you first start out exercising, it hurts, I know. So do something light. Don't go out and try to run 26 miles at first, walk around the block and eventually, maybe jog around the block. It takes time to change. Don't just awaken tomorrow and give up all your vices. Little changes, slowly. If you drink 10 pops a day, make one diet, then two, then three. Snack on vegetables and fruits.     It's doable, damnit.  I know and I don't stand for this "I can't lose weight" bullshit.     I still have the mindset of a fat person. That's not so easy to break. But, that also gets me out of bed on frozen Omaha mornings and out to the gym to do my morning run.     There's nobody to blame but your ownself.  Nobody can change you but your ownself.

      This year alone I have flown out of Eppley Airfield, here in Omaha, Nebraska, 7 times. Every single time, I am passed on to secondary searches where wands are run across me and I am further scrutinized. These, I cannot say, are random, as airport officials claim them to be. For example, during a three week period in which I was commuting between Omaha and Washington, D.C. every weekend, with a work-companion, I was thrice "randomly" picked for further scrutiny, while my traveling companion was never picked. Only once, in D.C. did I have to go through extra scrutiny, because my gold necklace was picked up by a metal detector. I did not have this problem in Denver, Ontario, California, Chicago (Midway), Indianapolis, Reagan International (with the exception of that one time after which I made sure to remove my necklace before entering the metal detector), or the Okaloosa County Airport when I ventured south to Ft. Walton Beach. Just here in Omaha.  urlLink Read Michael Smerconish's statement before the US Senate Appropriation Subcommittee on Transportation, etc.

      Interesting forwarded e-mail I received this morning.  Thought I'd 'share the wealth.'     "Food for thought...........       Learn these facts to properly debate    our poor misguided friends &  family before election time !!!      There were 39 combat related killings    in Iraq during the month of January.....  In the fair city of Detroit there were    35 murders in the month of January.      That's just one American city,    about as deadly as the entire war torn country of Iraq.      When some claim President Bush shouldn't    have started this war, state the following ...      FDR...  led us into World War II.    Germany never attacked us: Japan did.    From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost,    an average of 112,500 per year.      Truman...  finished that war and started one in Korea,    North Korea never attacked us.  From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost,    an average of 18,334 per year.      John F. Kennedy...  started the Vietnam conflict in 1962.    Vietnam never attacked us.      Johnson...  turned Vietnam into a quagmire.  From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were lost,    an average of 5,800 per year.      Clinton...  went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent,    Bosnia never attacked us.  He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter    three times by Sudan and did nothing.  Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions.      In the two years since terrorists attacked us    President Bush has ...  liberated two countries,    crushed the Taliban,    crippled al-Qaida,  put nuclear inspectors in Libya,    Iran and North Korea    without firing a shot,    and captured a terrorist who slaughtered    300,000 of his own people.      The Democrats are complaining    about how long the war is taking, but...  It took less time to take Iraq    than it took Janet Reno to take the  Branch Davidian compound.        That was a 51 day operation.      We've been looking for evidence of    chemical weapons in Iraq for less  time than it took Hillary Clinton to    find the Rose Law Firm billing records.      It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division    and the Marines to destroy the Medina    Republican Guard than it took Ted Kennedy to  call the police after his Oldsmobile  sank at Chappaquiddick.      It took less time to take Iraq than it took    to count the votes in Florida!!!!     Our Commander-In-Chief is doing a GREAT JOB!        The Military moral is high!      The biased media hopes we are too ignorant to realize the facts.      PASS IT ON."

       urlLink What the hell is this ? According to FoxNews, Mexican President Vicente Fox is "outraged" at the fact that immigration performed sweeps during the month of June and arrested and began deportation proceedings on 420 illegal immigrants.     The FoxNews goes on to say that     "At a Chicago rally for Mexicans living in the United States — now about 10 percent of his nation’s entire population — Fox promised that his government would not permit violations of the human and labor rights of Mexicans living in the United States. 'We will stand beside every Mexican woman and man in this country,' Fox told the crowd. 'We will defend them against the raids being carried out in the state of California.'" What in the hell is this? Fox doesn't stand behind his own damn people in his own damn country, but when immigration officials in the United States take actions to remove illegal aliens residing within the United States, it suddenly becomes a human rights violation and he (Fox) is the self-proclaimed champion of expatriate rights? Furthermore, who the hell is Fox to criticize "human and labor rights" at all when the Mexican government is notorious for human and  labor  rights violations.      Read the article.  It'll piss you off.  Unless, of course, you're a liberal, then it'll probably make you cry for those poor, poor immigrants who are being oppressed.  Yeah, right....

       A nother night and I can't sleep.  Perhaps I should pay the doctor a visit.  Knowing my luck, though, I'll have come down with some terminal illness.  And it won't just be a terminal illness, it will be an embarassing terminal illness, like cancer of the penis or something that ends up with me becoming more bald than I am now.  Blah....  Well, though, since I am up, I think I'll post the most random explination of network segmentation ever.  It was part of my homework this evening:   Prompt:  You arrive at your new job and your manager asks you to explain the role of network segmentation in improving performance. Remember that your manager does not understand technical buzz words; use language your manager will understand.   Response:  Network segmentation is akin to dividing a group of employees working on separate, unrelated projects into different offices where they cannot interfere with one another. Consider a group of 100 employees working on 10 separate projects. If you were to put them into one 10'x10' (100' square) room, with only one computer, one fax machine, one single-line telephone and one unisex restroom, things would get ugly really fast. All 100 employees would have to compete for everything: resources (restroom, computer, fax machine, etc.), physical space, and possibly even water (there's only one water cooler). Imagine trying to speak in an environment where everyone else is trying to speak at the same time. If someone yells, the entire room's going to hear it and be interrupted. Now, imagine your unsegmented network. Your 100 employees now translate into 100 devices – computers (clients and servers), VoIP telephones, printers, etc. These 100 devices are all sharing one trunk, possibly one router that connects to the network point of presence. Now, every time one device broadcasts (yells), the entire network is interrupted, regardless of weather the broadcast was meant of 1 or 10 devices, all 100 would be affected.   Enter network segmentation, our hero in short shorts. Let's go back to our 100 employees (forget the 100 devices for now). They're working in 10 separate groups, but stuck sharing one of every resource in one fairly cramped room. Let's assume our organization stopped being so cheap, and we moved into a building with 10 separate working areas (and more restrooms, assign a quantity as your heart (or bladder) sees fit). Now, our 100 employees are split into 10 rooms, with 10 people in each room. Each room is a segment and our employees are now segmented. Let's take two arbitrary rooms, we'll call them rooms 'A' and 'B,' for the purposes of this explanation. Suppose we're the wall between these rooms and can silently and invisibly observe what's happening in each room. In room 'A,' our group of 10 people is working on the color scheme for our organizational web page. In room 'B,' our group of 10 people is working on our organizational mascot. Group 'A' is fairly calm and quickly picks a set of pastel colors because they feel that such a pallet promotes synergy or something like that. Interaction between group members is frequent, however, our group is very polite and they wait until a speaker is done speaking before they speak (and only after raising their hands, this probably explains the choice of pastels). Turn the cheek to room 'B' where our group is working to pick our mascot. This group is fairly rowdy. 3 members are afraid of the other 7 and just sit in the corner, rocking back and forth, intimidated. The 7 members not in the corner are loud and interrupt one another in order to present each individual point. Finally, one member shouts/yells out that he thinks our mascot should be one of those little plastic bears that holds honey (the ones you buy at a supermarket). His yell interrupts the entire group and they stop their bickering to hear him, then to wonder at what the heck he's been smoking to come up with that. Group 'B's' yeller, despite interrupting his group with his yell (broadcast), did not bother anyone in Group 'A,' because his yell/broadcast was limited only to his segment. Group 'A,' meanwhile, is busy faxing and e-mailing copies of their proposed color scheme to someone that cares. Group 'B's' fax machine and computer sits waiting to be used, unaffected by what group 'A' is doing, since it's in a different segment. Such is with a network. Your network devices are divided such they they can work without consuming the entire avaiable network resources.

       S o, I couldn't get to sleep until one this morning.  I awoke at 4:30 and just stared at the ceiling.  At 5:30, it was time to go to work, so I stared at the coffee pot as my morning pot brewed.  Life is good, but not for those who can't sleep.  I went running at 7:00.  At least today I didn't almost pass out like yesterday morning -- that was wonderful.  The heat and humidity was so bad, I couldn't cool off.  I only ran 2 miles.  Today I ran 2 1/2, it's too damn hot.  I guess 6 mile Saturdays are out for a while.  I opened my  urlLink CafePress  store.  Now just to come up with sometime to sell.

      I'm moderately intelligent, at best. I figure, though, if one's going to do stupid things, they should do them to the best of their ability. Therefore, I recommend not doing something that I would do and if one should ever decide to drive from the heart of the United States to either coast, I highly recommend that you do it over the course of several days as opposed to one, long haul.  In any event, I rented a vehicle from  urlLink Enterprise  (since they were the only company that would not charge me an additional $10 to $20  urlLink fee , per day, for being under 25) and began my journey late last Friday morning. I covered the 1500 miles from Omaha to California over the course of two days and approximately 20 hours (as opposed to the 26-hour estimate given to me by  urlLink Rand McNally ). A few hours outside of the cesspool of hedonism popularly known as Las Vegas, Nevada, I sped past the  urlLink world's tallest thermometer . Located in the parking lot of the Bun Boy Restaurant, the Baker thermometer is visible for miles. On this particular day, it read 106 degrees, Fahrenheit. Stepping out of the car in order to use the facilities, I was greeted by a rush of dry, blistering heat. Tepid, though, in comparison with the sweltering conditions left behind in Omaha.  I proceeded towards home, not knowing whether I should have Liberalfornia-grown pride the fact that before I entered California, I had already traveled through five states (Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and Nevada) and it was only in California that I saw graffiti on every single overpass, regardless of the remoteness of the overpass' location. I marvelled at the fact that gang members need to lay claim to every piece of remote, harsh desert that they can lay their socially deviant hands upon (although, I think that their behavior is know the norm and that hard working, law abiding people are now the social deviants). I'm always proud (** sarcasm **) to know that California is the only state (out of the five I travelled through prior to arriving in California) where almost every overpass, regardless of the location, had some sort of gang-related grafitti plastered over it. It's good to know (** sarcasm** ) that those wonderful, hard-working, community members (as they tried to define themselves in court) are taking it upon themselves to spruce up the barren desert with colorful Spanish-language artwork. It makes me even more proud (** sarcasm** ) to realize that I share a similar ancestry with these fine, upstanding citizens and that their actions are the basis for most ingorant beliefs regarding me and other Hispanics. I'd smile, but I'm pissed.  I arrived home with 1504 miles put on to the rental car. Thank goodness for the unlimited miles. A few days later (or simply three), with an additional 1,050 or so miles put on the car from traveling within California, I left to return to Omaha. I figured this time I would just take the drive in one fell swoop. Easy enough, I suppose, but for the fact that I would lose two hours' time traveling east.  Traveling through SoCal, Nevada and Arizona was uneventful. Just outside of the tiny town of  urlLink Beaver , Utah, though, in  urlLink Beaver County , I crested a hill just in time to see a silver car sitting in the grass median of the Interstate. " Shit " I thought as I let off the gas. I passed the sheriff and continued on my way, staring into my rear-view mirror, hoping that I wasn't clocked, but I was. The flashers came on and I pulled over. 93 in a 75 zone. 2 miles per hour short of wreckless driving. Only $157.00 fine, which I was happy to pay (since my last ticket was almost $300).  The rest of the drive was mostly uneventful. Nearing my 20th hour behind the wheel and some 200 miles or so outside of Omaha, I began to see cliffs, recalling images of driving through northern Arizona. Creepy hallucinations. I had to pull over, stretch and take in a 15th cup of coffee.  The entire drive took a mere 22 hours. Not too shabby considering last year's long-haul from Lavalette, NJ to Omaha, NE took 26 hours (but a good deal of that was me being lost in Ohio since I'm too stupid to use maps).

      How I love to be behind the wheel.  The open road in front of me and the city behind me.  I have to make an quick trip to my least favorite state in the union, Liberalfornia, in order to attend to some personal items at home.  Since I must travel 1,500 west (3,000 round trip), I figured, why not drive.  Omaha to Los Angeles is but a few hours shorter than Lavalette, NJ to Omaha was (approximately 4 hours difference).   Friday I leave.  I'm hitting the open road and thank God it's not too late.   I make it a habit to take at least one road trip of note during my summer.  This will be it, although sadly for only a week.  My goal, though, is to make the entire trip from O! to LA in the 24 hours, 55 minutes estimate given to me by  urlLink Rand McNally .  We'll see.  Last year, I made it as far as the western suburbs of St. Louis when all the caffeine that I had been drinking since I began driving out of New Jersey caught up with me -- countless Red Bulls, some Xenadrine purchased at a truck stop, and about 8 cups of black, Interstate-grade coffee.   I doubt the driver behind me on I-70 was pleased when I suddenly had to throw my head out of the window and eliminate some caffeine from my stomach.  Lucky it was a beautiful morning in Eastern Missouri and the weather was pleasant enough to let me drive with the windows down.  Perhaps I should just stop in Grand Junction, Colorado, for the evening.  That's an approximate halfway point.  We'll see, though.  Maybe this year I'll finally get to see the Oregon Trail ruts off of Interstate 80.

      I weaned myself off of news this week. Friday, Saturday and Sunday I didn't even look at current events. It's nice. Current events bother me --  urlLink the   urlLink world  is  urlLink such  a  urlLink screwed  up  urlLink place . But, today is a new day and back to the old grind of reading the newspaper and wondering what rights I'm losing so that some activist gets his/her right (or how my grammar needs to change so that some activist get  his  way -- 'his/him' used to be correct in that sense, now it's just taboo).  As an aside, the text of  urlLink Roe vs. Wade  offers and interesting trail of cases, to include RvW, that guarantees an individual's right of personal privacy. As to whether one supports the ruling in toto is solely up to them, but I found this portion of the case, particularly section VIII, to be most interesting since I can now use it as argumentative fodder against the  urlLink PATRIOT Act , especially when arguing against those that believe that there is no right to privacy, according to the government.
