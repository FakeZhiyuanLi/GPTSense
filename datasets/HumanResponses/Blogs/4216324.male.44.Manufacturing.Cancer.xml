       I'm building a flagstone patio in the back yard.  It's been one of those kind of projects.  Financially expensive.  Physically exhausting.  Time consuming.  You're not supposed to start these kinds of projects in the middle of the Arizona summer.  "Now why did you give me  this  woman for a wife Lord?  To get me into these kind of hassles?"   The flagstone itself has been interesting to work with.  The various pieces aren't consistent in thickness.  Some are riddled with cracks.  Most are heavy, yet far too fragile.    The boys and I have worked like mules.  First carting 2500+ pounds of rock from the front yard delivery spot into the back yard.  There were two "washing operations" to see what I have to work with.  The worst has been working a "jigsaw puzzle," with 100+ pound pieces, to figure out how best to place the individual slabs.  Much good will come from this project.  One of my sons suddenly understands what a lack of education will do to him.  He's taking school a little more seriously now (I think).  The boys and I have been working together in relative harmony.  That must be good.  The work has put muscle back on me, and re-toughened soft hands.  (I really needed the exercise, anyway.)  My local church hopes to be building before fall.  I suspect I'll be using my freshly recalled constuction skills on the new Church House.  I see God's timing in all of this.  I have tried to avoid breaking up the stone.  Eventually, I will have to break the bigger pieces into smaller pieces.  Already, I have "trimmed some of the slabs so they'll fit in where I want them.  As a member of God's Church, you're a lot like those slabs of stone.  Too heavy, yet too fragile.  You're going to need trimming to fit in where He wants you.  He may break you up into smaller pieces, so you'll fit the pattern he is weaving.   When the work is done, you'll be a treasure and valuable addition to House.  The chisels and hammers, in the Makers hands, are your friends.  You'll just have to trust Him.

       Today I went to that bastion of character and morality, The American Red Cross, and allowed them to scrutinize my life. I must say I passed the examination and was allowed to contribute to this society and culture.  Okay, so all I did was donate a pint of blood.  They did look into my character.  If you haven't donated blood lately, there's a not-so-trivial, invasive inquisition to go through.   They ask you who you've had sex with. They ask you about the conditions under which you've had sex with people.   No answers?  No donation!  They are quick to discriminate against drug addicts and homosexuals. They aren't too keen on extended international travel either. (I didn't realize that where you travel contributes to your character.)  They're somewhat fussy about family history also.  Character matters.  If you lack character, eventually you'll drive into an error.  The error will be what people remember, not your great accomplishments.   The legacy of Dick Nixon is all about Watergate instead of China or the economy.   Bill Clinton's presidency will always be marred by "that woman" instead of the economy and balanced budget.  I go down to donate for the inquisition as much as the sick kids.  It's a object lesson reminder...It matters who you are and what you do, even when you think no one's looking.
