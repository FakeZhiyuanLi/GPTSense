      The beginning....  Prelude  I got my first job when I was 11 years old. I've helped found an investment bank in an East African country that most of you have never heard of. I worked as VP of Marketing in an offshore bank on a Micronesian island. I consulted a commercial bank in Central Asia. I raised millions of dollars for a transportation company. Graduated from UC Berkeley. All of this before the age of 21. Today, I am 27 and I am still travelling a different path.   By now, you must think that I'm a narcissistic jerk.  Well, not really.  The purpose of the story that I would like to tell is not to espouse my own greatness, because I, of all people, know that I'm really not all that hip. Different - I'll admit to. The reason I decided to sit down to write this blog is simply because I have an entertaining storyto tell. I know that the reader will be the judge of that and tell me if  what I write makes you dream of a  ventii latte. I do, also, have one alterior motive that I'll admit to right away - I hope that at some point, you will stop and think whether the life that you lead mirrors the life that you imagined when your dreamed about what you would become rather than what you would own.   Please dont misunderstand me - I am not making the assumption that the few people who would bother to read my ramblings are blatantly materialistic. I know that most of us like money because we believe that we can use it to buy freedom. I certainly do. When asked about our career and life choices, we often think of ourselves as victims of circumstance. Bills to pay. Mouths to feed. Mortgage payments to write. All of that is just reality.  At the same time, I would like to borrow one quote from a brilliant Czech writer Milan Kundera.   If Czech history could be repeated, we should of course find it desirable to test the other possibility each time and compare the results. Without such an experiment, all considerations of this kind remains a game of hypothesis.   Einmal ist Keinmal. What happens but once might as well not have happened at all. The history of Czechs will not be repeated, not will the history of Europe. The history of the Czech and of Europe is a pair of sketches from the pen of human life, unbearably light, light as a feature, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow.   Now substitue the euphemism for Czech Republic and Europe for your own life. Your own history. It can never be repeated, but it is made with every single moment that you walk this earth. Will your history be as light as "dust swirling into the air", or do you believe that whatever the elements of your existence add up to, really make up a sum that's greater than just its composite parts?  The epiphany that I had, and the one truly serious point that I would beg you to kindly consider, is that we must escape the blame game and make sure that we do not regret the life that we live; that we must use our life for one single purpose: to realize our potential. To express ourselves so well that once we are done, we do not feel the emptiness of a life lived for the benefit of survival, but the lightness of a man who knows that he simply has nothing else to give...  I will now stop with the Tolstoy-like prelude (forgive me for that) and move on to the first part of the story that I truly hope will entertain you.  Chapter 1 - The First Job  Moscow, Soviet Union. Summer 1988.  As I mentioned before, I got my first real job when I was eleven, and not because I was looking for one. I was certainly not what you would call a "regular" Moscow kid when growing up. I was massively anti-social, ridiculously shy, overweight, unable to fistfight (an absolute must in Moscow playgrounds among maturing alpha males), unable to play soccer (basis for immediate excommunication and qualification as an untouchable), and quite frankly an aspiring screenwriter. I had by that age read pretty much all of Chekhov and Tolstoy and was shooting for Dostoevsky. Not that I totally comprehended what I read, but books were my only friends.  My mother, on the other hand, was a progressive business-person. She had a bustling couture business that she ran out of our living room, hussling cheap Polish jeans, Polish Chanel dresses, and packages of bubble gum. The business was highly profitable and highly dangerous, because she had no "krysha" (cover) in the ranks of the militia or the street racketeers. Nevertheless, even though she made a brilliant living for those times, when an opportunity came up to accept a new legitimate job with a good salary, she jumped on the bandwagon of the legitimately employed. (Not that she really ever stopped hussling merchandise from our apartment - she just scheduled appointments around her work hours).  The job that she accepted, with the second cooperative ever to be registered in the Soviet Union, was highly unusual for those times. In order for you to understand just how unusual, let me remind you that the years is 1988. The 'Law on Cooperatives' was adopted May 26, 1988 and implemented July 1, 1988.   The 'Law on Cooperatives', was a radical departure from traditional Soviet dogma and offered real changes. Minimum membership requirements were set at three individuals, full-time work in the cooperative was permissible, and no special permission was needed to form one. While hiring paid workers was still not allowed, cooperatives could hire individuals on a contract basis, reducing the wage labor issue to simply an ideological relic. The cooperatives were clearly intended to function in a market system and featured independent production planning, financial accountability, and democratic management.   This cooperative was founded by a talented, brutal, autocratic, maniacally self-involved person who will play a huge part in my later life - let's call him Mr. L in order to protect his identity. Following a brilliant career within the circles of the Soviet elite, he had founded the first private enterprise in the Soviet Union that concentrated on manufacturing domestic computer hardware and software. Within the next two years, the company took off like a meteor, with revenues of over 50 million USD (converted at the official rate) a year. Mr. L was to pay heavily for his success - a fascinating and revealing story; but more on that later.  My mother's position as "procurement manager" enabled her to leverage her abilities to make the impossible happen without a hitch. If a VIP delegation was coming to visit, she would make sure that the banquet table was always furnished with the finest vodka, cognac, and wine as well as the sevruga caviar and fine cigars - items that were simply impossible to find during the Perestroika years. She dressed the entire company staff in bootleg foreign attire (of course, she never forgot to make a nice mark-up for herself). If the boss wanted to get tickets to the Bolshoi for a sold-out performance the same night - DONE! Too bad there is no such thing as deficit in the USA, or my Mom would be rolling in benjamins.  Anyhow, Mr. L has always been the one to test the patience of the authorities. Therefore, as a part of Alf'as marketing strategy, he devised an idea that was part genius, part madness. Sort of like the man himself. This idea really turned shit upside down for him and for me both.  He decided to hire five kids, who would travel around the country to various IT-related trade shows and conferences and demonstrate the software designed by "Alpha" to the adult professional attendees at the company stand. By doing this, Mr. L would violate circa twelve laws, including child exploitation, child employment, distribution of wages to children, and a number of other that I cannot quite recall. He would also gain a number of impressed customers and massive media exposure. Regardless of the commercial rationale, the prospect of giving the government the finger gave him a true hard-on, so he made the decision of hiring this group of 11- to 15- year olds without hesitation and any regard to his partners' well-documented dismay.  During the interview process, we were subjected to a 2-day long session during which the HR staff (Mr. L took the hiring process with his usual paranoidal intensity) tested our IQ, stress tolerance, behavioral characteristics, and personability. From among about 20 applicants, I made the cut. And as much as a I begged and pleaded with my mother, explaining to her that I would rather die than engage in dirty speculation (Cultural note: in the Soviet Union, the country of extremes, the same people who in 2004 are making billions on stolen assets, were in 1989 advocating the principle that all activity which involves making a profit beyond your regular salary is highly immoral and is called 'speculation' - it was extremely offensive and derisive for a good Soviet to be called a 'speculant'), she insisted that this position would be an opportunity of a lifetime for me. I now grudgingly admit that for once, she was actually right.   Following a sleepless night that involved a non-verbal litany of self-deprication, homicide plotting against my Mother, and a half-hearted suicide attempt, I took the metro at 8.45 AM with the firm knowledge that my life is officially over and a faint hope that I would be dismissed immediately on the grounds of tardiness.  When I walked into the headquarter of "Alfa", the long-legged receptionist gave me an indifferent stare and directed me to the room where the first day of "training" was taking place. The moment that the door opened and I walked into the conference room converted into a temporary training center for the kindargarten bunch, the first words that I heard were "You are late, baldie. Sit here and shut up." (I was bald because I had just undergone treatment for lice, not an uncommon occurence for children growing up in the "communal" flats of Moscow). Pause.... Silence.... Giggling..... None of it had registered in my shaven head.  All I could do was stop and stare at the angel who had just uttered the sweetest eight words that I still could not gather myself to process.  I don't want to hear that 11-year-olds cannot fall in love. They might not understand what love is, but the intensity that you experience the first time you see a girl that you like is something that even the best orgazm of your life cannot ever touch. You only get to feel it that strongly once in your life, and I hope that some of you are as lucky as I am to remember this moment vividly.  My career and love life began at the same untouchable, embarassing, fleeting moment... I did not understand it then, but this was my first experience of the Unbearable Lightness of Being.
