      I went a long, long time before ever seeing a baby born in the caul (inside the amniotic sac). In hospitals, the membranes are ruptured (broken) somewhere along the way in every birth I have been to. Even in birth centers, Artificial Rupture of Membranes (AROM) is absolutely commonplace. At Casa, the students need to learn to rupture the membranes (and yes, "rupture" isn't the prettiest word... some say "release" which IS nicer, but absolutely contraindicated in AROM), so we routinely did so... sometimes with our fingers, fingernails (inside gloves), or with the AmniHook... a long crochet-needle looking thing with a beak on the end that snags the bag and breaks it, releasing the water.   (Rupturing membranes is a blogspot unto itself... another day... remind me!)   Then, a midwife at Casa thought it would be a grand idea to see how many babies we could have born in the caul and the game was on. I'd heard about an OB that was so disgusted with AROM that he offered a $50 bounty for every caul birth and shelled out thousands before calling the game... proving that it  is  possible and  isn't  dangerous and not AROMing did  not  slow labors down, but, in fact, helped women cope better.  The first caul birth I saw was so cool! I was doula-ing at UCSD at the Birth Center (on the 4th floor) and the CNM was terrific in wanting to leave things alone. As the baby was being born, it dawned on me that the mom's membranes were still intact; soooo cool! The baby was born with a tight sac on the face and shoulders before the midwife used forceps to break and lift the bag off the baby's face before the first breath.  Another I saw was at Casa. I spent a lot of time there in 2002... about 9 months total that year. There were times I was so exhausted, I could not get up to witness births. My first trip there in 1993, I went to every single birth I possibly could... 90 in 3 months, catching 30 myself. These long months of "getting numbers" in order to sit for the California exam, were exhausting and sometimes I just ignored the "Birth in the Bear Room!" call over the intercom.  But, when cool things happened, I was asked to come anyway to photograph. I always made sure the mom was asked if it was okay before I was awakened because I had shown up once with a camera and a mom was horrified. I left with camera in tow.  So, there was a birth happening and the membranes were still intact and someone knew the birth would be something to see. Groggily, I grabbed my camera and went to the birth, watching and taking picture after picture of the most amazing sight; the sac began protruding, water filling up the sac gradually... a slow, s l o w birth where the sac came long before a head did. I began seeing hair floating in the water behind the amazing amnion and chorion... flecks of vernix swirling around as the head began being able to be seen.  I have a picture here:   urlLink http://www.picturetrail.com/gallery/view?p=999&amp;gid=4228092&uid=631889&amp;members=1&galleryPassword=emTzTTD1RyAd2&amp;   As the baby was born, the bag broke and water spilled onto the bed and the midwife lifted the bag over his face. I loved capturing it on film!  One birth here in San Diego, I was the first assist and was behind a kneeling mama with the midwife. It was cave-dark and we began watching the membranes bulge the perineum. This midwife had not seen a birth in the caul, so I gave whispering instructions about how to manage it so the baby can breathe.  When the head is born, it is important to watch for breathing motions because if those happen, it is important to remove the sac from the face. If s/he isn't making a motion to breathe, allowing the body to flow out inside the caul is perfectly fine. Once the chest is born, removing the sac is imperative since the first inhalation often comes from the release of chest compression from the vagina. I explained about lifting from the chin upwards because two midwives I know had babies aspirate their amniotic sac because it was pulled downwards from forehead to chin and as it came down, the baby inhaled. (Remember how I said we are a product of our experiences? This is a lesson I learned without it happening to me directly!)  So, as she is pushing, we see a darkness in the forward moving sac... vernix? meconium? I had the third assist grab the flashlight and we peered into the sac. Inbetween pushes, the floating stuff settled to the bottom of the "bag" and we had to wait for the next contraction to stir things up again. It was wild to watch! Once the contraction began, we saw that it was, indeed, meconium and pretty darn thick, too. The midwife asked mom's permission to break the water right before the head was born so she could suction with a DeLee (something we don't do anymore) and mama said, "okay," so we did. I often wonder what that would have looked like to let the baby keep coming in the floating mec pool. Probably safer.  As this baby came out, even though the midwife had broken the bag, the amniotic sac was still covering the baby's face. She, however, did not see it! I showed her how it looked like cellophane and that anytime there are late ROM, to check closely to get the face cleared. She was wide-eyed as I pulled a completely covering film of amniotic sac off the baby's face... chin to forehead. The baby inhaled as I lifted.  It is said that babies born in the caul are special or gifted. Various traditions around the world say that the baby will never drown... that the baby will be a midwife... that the baby will have a second sight (a view into the Other Side or psychic powers). I find, as time goes by, that I touch membranes less and less. I believe they are there for a reason... will break when ready... and serve a purpose we might never know.  But, can I tell you quick about how the gift of an amniotic sac helped my partner Sarah after her eye cancer surgery?  You see, in hospitals, placentas (with their amniotic sacs) are "donated" by the women. Cosmetic companies and, ever increasingly, medical supply places buy them for a variety of reasons. Many of us feel women should be paid for their placentas, but the hospital considers them donations (tax deductible? I don't think so). Hardly anyone knows about this donation, either.  So, many parts to the story that I will eventually blog, but Sarah had to have some lymphoma cut out of her eyeball (in the white, not over the part where she sees) and the surgeons were discussing the surgery and all that it entailed. They told us that they would graft it (cover it, actually) with one of two things: the foreskin of a circumcised penis or the amnion of an amniotic sac. I could NOT believe, first of all, that they really sold and USED foreskins from babies. She said she could not have that in her eye because then she would be cock-eyed. They didn't laugh. Really, truly, she told them ethically she could not do that. They said fine, amnion it is (there are two pieces to the amniotic sac... the amnion and the chorion... each has its role in the baby department and can be separated, but is very much like sticky cellophane pulling them apart). They were equally unamused when I offered to bring in swatches of amniotic sacs to see which one matched her eye color best. We thought it was hysterical.  After her surgery, we could see this precious gift from an unknowing mom and baby... a centimeter-wide circle that was covering where the cancer had been dug out and sutured with 40 stitches... teeny tiny stitches that she blinked on for several weeks. We both thought of and sent prayers of thanks to this mom and baby that they would give this gift so Sarah's eyeball cells could regrow together, using the amnion as a scaffold to cross and join together as it healed.  Within weeks, the amnion was covered and we couldn't see it anymore. Her body had absorbed it... made it her own.  What a miracle our bodies are!

      Already, I have gotten email asking why this mom died... how did that happen... could it happen at home... what meds did she have in labor.  While they pretty much knew why before the autopsy, the diagnosis stated that she did, indeed, die of an amniotic embolism (amniotic fluid embolism... AFE)  Here are a couple of sites to read about the syndrome:   urlLink http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic122.htm   Here's one that has case studies where women lived:   urlLink http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ija/vol5n4/amniotic.xml   AFE happens at home, in birth centers, in hospitals, in ORs during cesareans. It just happens and no one really knows why.  Some women feel, once they know about AFE, that they are safer in hospitals so they can  do  something if it happens. I have heard of 3 cases of fatal AFE in my life (including the one I witnessed) and they were all in the hospital. Granted, by sheer numbers, the odds are greater, but the hospital did not save the women. The babies did, all live (1 was already born with the AFE occurred), so yes, a cesarean could possibly save the baby if done quickly during the crisis. But, by looking at the stats, even that isn't a guarantee... and, sadly, many of those children are compromised.  The mom whose death I witnessed had no medications at all during her labor. She did have an IV, but only with Lactated Ringers. IVs do not cause AFEs... women have had them without them.  I know all the discussions that revolve around my story. I have heard them since she died in 1986:  What if she had been up walking? What if she hadn't had a vaginal exam? What if her waters weren't broken? (they were not artificially broken, she ruptured her membranes spontaneously)  Believe me, if there was something that caused this that someone could pinpoint, we would surely not do it anymore... it is that dramatic.  (I am reminded of Star Trek IV [again! someone just mentioned this the other day] when the doctor is in the hospital and sees a woman going in for Dialysis and he comments how archaic that is! and fixes her immediately. I pray that is what will come to pass each day I work with pregnant and laboring women; that something miraculous will be discovered and women will not have the risk of AFE ever again.)  I often say that midwives are a product of their experiences. (Everyone is, but midwives make judgement calls based on theirs.) This woman dying in my sight kept me from midwifery for another 15 years. I simply was not mature enough emotionally or spiritually to take the lives of two people in my hands.  I am sure that pisses off many UCers reading this... that those lives aren't in my hands. But they ARE when someone hires me to keep them alive should one or the other... or both... need to be re-lifed until help that surpasses my skills arrives to take over.  When I had Tristan, I was so inducted in the Medical Model, I thought his birth was perfect! (I promise to write it out soon... all three of my own birth stories are over-due.) I wrote letters thanking the hospital... thanked the nurses with flowers... the doc with chocolate and a letter of praise.  When I had Meghann, I was angry with The System. My Bradley class taught me all I needed to know to birth alone and, I thought, safely. Dr. White's  Emergency Childbirth  on the dresser, visualizations of perfection continuing, dozens of books under my belt... and endless discussions with Marilyn Moran (the founding mother of American UC)... all served to help me feel more than ready to have a baby without the hindrance of a midwife or doctor or hospital. I could do it!  And then Meggie nearly died from a shoulder dystocia that no one knew how to resolve. Blessedly, the Universe/God/Nature/her Spirit, twisted her out and she was born needing resuscitation and reviving... a few pumps of her heart with fingers, included. It was terrifying.  I was still in that place of arrogance, however. She had made it. She was so beautiful! I had squatted and had a 10 pound 6 ounce child at home with no midwife, no episiotomy, no tear... delivered my own placenta... nursed perfectly. I was HIGH!  Pregnant with Aimee, I watched this woman die and my pendulum that had swung so widely between Tristan's and Meghann's birth... finally found its center.  I have remained in that center.  Even as I explore a more hands-off birthing style, I am ever grateful and thankful that I have the skills I have... and that I have them available should women want and need them (and their babies, too).  I found humility that day.  I thank the woman for the gift she never consciously knew she gave me... she gave me the maturity to wait many more years... she gave me balance to see that doctors aren't all animals out to eat their prey... that even the most repulsive men and women can work until they fall to their knees to save another human being. I watched men and women, whom I had written off as having no souls, sob into each other's shoulders and their own hands. She gave me a reality... a biting, painful, slapping reality... I had never expected in birth. Hearing about death is one thing, but witnessing it is completely something else.  Witnessing death in birth... another thing altogether.  Thank you, dear woman, who gave her life so I might gain mine. You will never know the gifts I have received.

      I had had that sucky hospital birth, then my UC with Meghann and, even though I had trouble (shoulder dystocia), I was still euphoric with the Perfection of Birth when I was pregnant with Aimee in Frankfurt, Germany. I was doula-ing for women regularly at the Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center... sitting happily with CNMs, RNs, and even some of the docs... asking a zillion questions about birth. I was more than a dry and parched sponge; I simply could not learn enough even with the 10 books I read a week on birth (no Net or tv or videos back then!).  One of the nurses called and told me a woman needed some help, could I come and help her out. Sure!  I got up there and worked with her for a few hours... it was really nice. She had some nubain, so was dozing and I was out talking at the nurse's station and another nurse came and said a woman really needed a happy face for a minute... could I please come and talk to her. Absolutely.  I went in and spent about 10 minutes with a sweet couple... talking about their baby coming... helping her move from tears to smiles... and we had a couple three contractions together. I held her hand.  I was sitting at the nurse's station as she was wheeled to the Delivery Room and I went and stood outside the door to watch her have her baby.  As she began pushing, the usual scene unfolded... she was draped, she grabbed the hand grips, her man at her head (dressed head to toe in blue-green), and the nurse and doc were exhorting her to push.  Then, hell entered the room.  The woman passed out and she began bleeding. A nurse hit the button on the wall and a storm of green came from every orifice of the hospital. Within a blink, the father was shoved next to me, anesthesia was gassing the mom, and blood began pouring everywhere. Creeks, rivers, oceans of blood.  This mom still encased her baby and I could hear the docs screaming with confusion about what to do first... get her under anesthesia? was she already dead? just cut her open?  My head was swirling with horror and fear as I grasped the father's hand who was out of his body with fear.  I watched doctors I despised work until they fell down from exhaustion only to be replaced by other doctors I adored. I watched as the docs worked as they were  trained  to do; to save a life... it was their ultimate training and, for the first time ever, I respected that training.  I watched a choreography of bloody dancers, bagging and intubating the mom, doing CPR on her as she had heart failure, nurses who'd opened two more IV lines in her neck squeezing blood into her body... over and over... the anesthesiologist screaming to just get the baby OUT and the OB finally deciding it was time to get to the poor suffocating baby. 7 minutes hadn't passed since she entered the DR.  The floor was already puddled with red, but as the doc used his scalpel to open the abdomen, a waterfall of blood poured out of her body and over the table and I saw the mom begin bleeding from places I never imagined. Her nose, eyes, mouth, fingernails... her very skin turned red as she went into complete DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation). I thought I was going to vomit from the scene, but I prayed for the baby they pulled lifeless from her body.  Another team grabbed the baby and waded to the warming table and began working on the blood-covered baby. Wiping him with towels, they intubated and brought the baby to a groggy and brain-damaged life.  Dazed, dad went with the baby to the nursery and I went to sit against the wall across from the DR. I began crying and could not stop. The nurses and docs who filed past me gave me no notice whatsoever; they were in their own pain.  I had my other mom still in labor and she was going to be delivering in her labor room (highly unusual) so no one had to go down to the DRs until things were tended to and cleaned up. From down the hall, I watched as the mom, under a clean white blanket, was wheeled down to the morgue... and I walked into my client's room, held her hand, breathed with her, and watched as her precious... oh so precious... baby was born.  They both lived.

      What is it about birth that is so unpredictable sometimes?  It is common knowledge amongst caregivers that those that live in their heads (dancers, athletes, computer geeks) have the hardest time allowing birth to happen in their bodies.  Some women take several childbirth classes and read a hundred books, all in the hopes of conquering the mysteries of birth.  But, those mysteries are different for every woman and not taught in any book.  In 21 years, I have known 3 women to have general anesthesia for their cesareans.  2 in the last year.  I find that incredibly odd.  In preparing for The Perfect Birth, women read all the "right" books, take Bradley and Hypnobirthing classes, hire homebirth midwives that believe in them, hire doulas to tend to the needs the midwife or partner can't or doesn't... and visualize, meditate, pray... all in the dream of creating a peaceful, wondrous (usually) waterbirth.  Labor arrives (or not) and obstacle after obstacle falls in the way of that Perfect Birth.  The due date comes and goes far, far away... membranes rupture long before labor begins... blood pressure climbs... a posterior labor digs into the pain threshold like no one else can understand... a fever elevates... fetal heart tones do funky things... exhaustion sets in.   What is the lesson?  Is it surrender?  How much  does  one have to surrender before the obstacles vanish and something resembling the original birth desires materialize?  Even when the woman does surrender, I still see the Universe throwing shit at the woman's birth plan: she gets the crappiest doc on-call... the vacuum doesn't work even after 3 tries... the baby is too high for forceps... her vagina gets cut and THEN she has a cesarean... the spinal or epidural don't take... and then she is out for the entire birth.  Why do some women have to experience this?  The worst is that 2/3 of the women I know who had this experience will never birth again (choice), so replaying their births differently will never happen.  Therapy, talking, rebirthing, etc. have still not quelled the pain of not being there for their babies' births (consciously).  I speak often to women who talk to me about their Perfect Births... about how there are 2 players in this game of life.  That mom might be totally evolved and ready to birth the way she visualizes, but the baby might have its own agenda (don't they always?) and might need to be born out the belly instead of through the vagina.  Perhaps in another day and time, out the vagina might have meant death and they remember that, so choose out the belly instead.  Surely they know things we don't know about how to move inside the uterus, right?  What happens when there is direct conflict between two extremely powerful people's needs?  Someone gives in.  Oh, sorry... the common (PC) word is "compromise."   cough   And if mom isn't the one to give in, the baby does... and one person's needs vanish.  This is my issue with UC.  Whose will wins?     taking a break for a few minutes    I don't understand so much about birth.  I wonder if women in the jungle ponder their birth stories as much as we do.  There is no need for marriage counseling in cultures that have black & white rules about what marriages look like.  Someone might be unhappy, but that's just the way it is.  Women's vaginas fall out in Africa.  Women's bladders fall out in Asia.  Women struggle with bodily injury due to their caregiver's inability to respect and help properly.  From what I know, they don't call it birthrape.  Are we thinking too much?  If we lived in a subsistance culture, would we have time to worry that we can't write a letter because our midwife yelled at us?  Our culture affords us too much time, I think.  Blogging probably isn't a priority in Ecuadorian pueblos.  Navelgazing can often spiral into vertigo.

       This is part of a post I wrote a couple of weeks ago and since it is part of a birth story, I am re-working it as the complete birth story.  Some details are removed to keep anonymity, but I am not exaggerating at all.

      This story is one part of the catalyst for my transformation as a midwife.  I will write Connie's birth as another part soon.  Of course, each birth that I have witnessed or participated in has assisted the growth and change, but Connie and Donna were very much my ChangeMakers.   Donna's telling of the story is very different than mine... similar events, but each of us has the timing off somewhat... irrelvant to the actual feeling of the birth.  In Donna's story, I am but a comma in her novel and I love that about this story!  This story, from her perspective and her family's, is this IS their story.  Not the midwife's.  That is the highest compliment.       The story below, as written, will appear in the Dec. 2004 issue of Midwifery Today.

      This will be an on-going list that began out of my birthrape blogspot. I asked others to write me and tell me what was said to them that I hadn't heard myself. Already, I am getting painful emails filled with stories of disrespect, disbelieving, and sometimes, disgusting examples of what others, who are supposed to be caregivers, have said to women in pregnancy, labor, birth, and postpartum.  Please send your examples to me, Barb Herrera, at  urlLink msgardenia@cox.net   -------------------------------------------------------------------------  * There's not much happening here (as the midwife does a vaginal exam)  * One woman wanted to stand on her own during her births, but, both times, was forced to do a deep squat or be supported by others, causing vaginal tears and "mad" that she wasn't honored at her own births (her words).  * I had a midwife write me thanking me for disclosing what she, too, has seen in her training. Blessed Be! I am not alone!    This next series from a nurse friend of mine:    *  "Stupid Bitch" (said by a Doc before he even left the room) *  The same doc (we hated this prick, he still practices) elbowed a woman (hard) in the thigh because she wouldn't open wide enough for him *  "Well, the Anesthesiologist is here now for another pt and he wants to go home, this is your last chance for an epidural" *  "If you would just stop moving we could get a good tracing on the baby" (and other variations of the same) *  "Quit being such a baby" *  "Oh come on, it doesn't hurt that bad, you are only ____cms dialated." *  "These stupid wetback women just scream and scream, I wish they would shut up" (same prick as above) *  "If you don't hurry up we will have to do a c-section" *  "No way is that one going to deliver vag, did you see the size of her?" (I personally have never seen a vag delivery of anyone over like 200, that is after preg weight) *  "No you can't walk because you are on pit" (everyone I have ever seen in labor was on pit) *  "Walking doesn't do anything for labor" (said by a doc, different one than above) *  "Oh no, she has a birth plan" *  "If you wanted to walk you should have stayed home" (after her IV is in and she is on pit now) *  "Give her a sleeper already so she will be quiet and stop bugging us"

      Second time mom, first homebirth after a very difficult hospital vaginal delivery for her first... lovely couple, 5 year old daughter... and mom is in labor. I hear noises as I run in from outside to see if birth is imminent and toss my stuff down, stethoscope on the dining room table that is laid out with food (grandma was there taking care of everyone).  Another midwife is there (again, I am second assist) and we sit with mom for a few minutes as we assess what is going on. The other midwife checks her and she is about 4cm, so we know we have time to get our equipment and such together and set up.  I smell something foul.  Wrinkling my nose, I walk out into the livingroom and there, on the dining room table, is my precious Littman stethoscope on fire... nearly fired in half. I slammed something on it (a plate of hummus?) to put out the fire and then shook my head at the stupidity of throwing something onto a table with no less than 5 candles burning. (The duck story after this blog story happened less than a week after this!) Dang, did it stink in there. We opened windows and fanned things (it was December) until we were freezing too much.  Labor progresses slowly and mom, a beautiful, sensual, big woman, decides it is pool time, so she climbs into the blow-up birth pool we sell and proceeds to make it her new home. As the hours pass, we continue our emptying and re-filling ritual I call Going To The River since it is removing water with pans and pitchers and refilling with kettles and pans of boiling water... walking to and fro, over and over, hours at a time.  We were tired and one midwife was dozing on the couch a few feet from us. The assistant and I were leaning close to mama and dad was also kinda dozing behind mom who was dozing between contractions, but moaning beautifully during her surges. We all kinda zoned between contractions.  The dog of the house had an itching fetish, so had to wear a cone around her neck at all times. We chuckled at first, but got used to it. The kitty thought we were nuts and kept coming around trying to see what mom and dad were doing (sis was sleeping with grandma during much of this). The cat sat on a chair next to the pool so she could watch mom in labor and, in a moment of impulse, the cat tried to jump  into  the pool! She missed. What she did get done was she got her claws dug into the top ring of the pool and it began leaking.  Suddenly, we were all bolted awake... looking for tape, talking calmly with mom who was laughing, too... covering the claw holes... and then looking for the bike pump to pump the ring back up. (Where was that patch kit that came with the pool anyway?!)  As things settled down again, mom was leaning her head on the pool and it slowly deflated. As her ear would touch the water, the assistant would use the bike pump to pump up the ring again. Mom's head would inch its way out of the water, up to the proper place again, only to have the experience repeated every 15 minutes or so. It was so funny to see... down, down, down... up, up, up! She wasn't bothered by the movement at all.  Easily, 2 hours of this go by and the dad pumped once instead of the assistant, and he took the pump hook-up out of the little pokie thing in the pool. Miraculously, the pool didn't deflate anymore! We should have just pumped up the pool and disconnected the pump... would have saved hours of pumping, mom's ear in the water, and laughter. Well, the laughter was a good thing.  smile   During one time that mom got out to wander around, she was swaying during a contraction and a spider on a web dropped from the ceiling... right in front of her... dropped fast... and then abruptly stopped in front of her face! The spider swung there for a moment or two and then continue his/her descent. We looked at each other and laughed. This birth was getting to be rather amusing.  On cue, the dog walked in and we turned our heads sideways to figure out what was different. The cone was gone! Dad walked around the house and outside looking for the cone, but it had vanished. Maybe someone walking by took it off? We couldn't imagine the dog wouldn't have barked; it was only 5am.  Not long after dawn (we sent mom to dig her feet and hands in the earth to remind her Self of her basic connection to it... right up her alley of requests for us to do), mom had a giant little boy with everyone delighted and amazed at his beauty and enormity. Once everything was tended to, we left them to heal and bond.  I did the postpartum visits on days one and three. On day 3, I had an intuition to go to the corner of the yard and dig. Within two digs, I found the dog's cone. I debated taking it back to the owners (thinking how clever of the dog to hide something that annoyed her so much!), but she was scratching herself raw and that was worse; she would have to be medicated a lot for it and possible infection, so I returned the cone to the owners. I swear the dog stuck her tongue out at me.  Mom talked about all the signs she had that laughter was so important in this birth. She, usually happy and laughing, tended towards being kind of morose and somber during labor. The humorous things that happened brought much-needed levity.  I often use humor to remind people of the joy that is happening. Sure, labor is work, but it can be joy-filled work!  I have several new stethoscopes now (all Littman) and am very careful where I toss them.   laughing

      A beautiful labor... second generation homebirthing mama with 13 family members in the room (all homeborn but one), plus the cutest white dog you have ever seen.  One sister had a video camera going for hours... labor was nearing its end, mom was feeling grunty and began pushing on her side on the bed.  As is typical with birth, the energy pulls people in in a spiral motion... the spiral starting further out early in labor, and the spiral closing tighter until the actual birth and then the spiral reverses and starts moving outward again.  Because birth was close, everyone was tightly surrounding this lovely mama.  Her midwife (I was a second assist) always has ice for pushing because many women find the ice soothing.  As this mama was pushing, she, without opening her eyes, says, "it's burning" and the midwife says, "tell me where and I will put ice on there for you."  Mom's eyes fly open and she says, "Something is BURNING!" and we all look up and not one foot from my face is a down comforter on full fire next to the bed.  The midwife jumps off the bed, grabs the quilt, runs across the room with it (as embers are floating behind her!) and she tosses it into the baby pool mom hadn't gotten in at all during the birth, popping the top ring on the pool, but putting out the fire.  The room started laughing hysterically at the very weirdness of the experience and the mom, having a baby (for crying out loud!) hollers at everyone, "Shut up!  You all shut up!" and we stifle everything we can behind our hands and tight lips.  Mom has a beautiful girl not long after and when the subject of the fire comes up again, now we all could laugh and talk about it.  The sister who had been been videotaping tells us that she had to change tapes during the Running of the Comforter!  On the tape, you can see the client laboring, a huge flash of light in the corner, and then black... and then the birth.  We'd missed the whole thing on tape!  The most bizarre was how, of all the people in the room, the laboring mom was the one to smell, see, sense the fire.  It is yet another indication that women in labor are not so out of it they have no sensibilities.  The client tells us that when another brother came over the next day, he looked into the baby pool and saw the charred feathers and said, "What, didja have a duck?"  This client is pregnant again (my client this time) and we promised not to throw comforters on candles during the birth.   laughingsmile     An aside:  This baby walked at 9 months old.  Well,  ran  at 9 months old!  I had never seen anything like it before.  I went to their home and she ran in the yard with knee-high grass!  It was like watching a computer graphic, that's how surreal it was.

      I had a doula client in Frankfurt... a nurse (relevant to the story)... who had herpes so bad during her delivery, she had it on her breasts, her fingers, and belly besides the lesions on her pubic area and mouth.   She still delivered vaginally and breastfed.  This birth is where I learned about Tegaderm... it was rare back then, but now, I keep supplies of it for many purposes, herpes being but one.   Tegaderm is a bandage kind of thing, but clear (and expensive!).  Most people know it as the clear plastic stuff they put on top of your IV when they are done putting it in.  Tegaderm is what we put on Sarah's operated-on eye during the fires and when she showered so nothing could get in it.  We use Tegaderm with stitches so showers can be had without wetting them (I did that for all my biopsies).  The literature calls it "transparent dressing."  In births now, we use it to cover the Hep Lock so women can be in water without concern for the IV site.  Tegaderm also covers lesions allowing for birth to occur without "contaminating" the surrounding area.  We have done this in homebirth, too.  (I am avoiding the whole issue of shedding without lesions, the risk of herpes and newborns, the un-likelihood of any OB using Tegaderm on a lesion and allowing a vaginal birth, the possibility of lesions inside the vagina or on the cervix that Tegaderm cannot touch, etc.  I am merely sharing a story of an experience I was a part of.)  This mom had a quick labor and wore a glove on her herpes'd hand, Tegaderm everywhere else, including her outer labia that had several lesions.  She Tegaderm'd the lesions on her breasts (they were not on her nipples) and brought her baby to her breast as she nursed wonderfully after the birth.  She had a lifetime supply of the stuff and her baby never caught the herpes (that we could tell), but last I heard, the titers for herpes were non-existent in the baby.  I  highly  doubt this preferential treatment would have been given to anyone else that didn't work on the L&D floor.  Tegaderm for all!

      I was a doula in Frankfurt and had many clients in the hospital there.  One of the cool things of the time there (1985-1988) was that epidurals were not an option unless the woman was having a cesarean.  Women did just fine in labor without them; it reminds me that women can still do perfectly fine without one now.  Oh, and the word "doula" did not exist in birth at that time.  I called myself a "Labor Coach" or a "Labor Companion."  I only met one other doula during those years at a La Leche League Conference... I wonder where she is now!  Women were triaged in one room, labored in another, birthed in the Delivery Room (DR), recovered in the Recovery Room (RR), and then were moved to the Postpartum Floor.  The Labor Rooms were at least 2 women together, sometimes 4, but they tried not to do that too much.  Rarely, women got their own room until the hospital was being renovated and the renovation complete.  Even if they had their own rooms, they were separated by a thin wall and there were no doors on the rooms, merely curtains... opening into a hallway where the nurses station was and the nurses and docs sat and yickety yacked and laughed loudly while women labored feet from their seats.  The Delivery Room was an Operating Room (OR) and women were moved from the bed in the Labor Room to a gurney then to the OR table in the middle of the DR for the delivery then to a gurney after delivery and then to another bed for recovery and yet another for postpartum.  Lots of butt lifting and sliding; epidurals wouldn't have been helpful!  After the birth, moms got a cursory "bonding time" of about 30 minutes, but that was more theory than practice.  More usual was the baby in the Nursery for at least 2 hours postpartum; the time mom was also in Recovery.  So, I have this woman in labor... she is progressing beautifully.  Most women were confined to bed, but after time, they got to know me and I was able to get my ladies sitting, standing, etc. as long as the monitors were functioning.  I have held more fetal heart monitor electrodes in place for HOURS than any woman should have a history doing.  This one particular woman was moaning so nicely... and she was sharing a room with another mom who was not doing so well.  After a few hours, the other woman was being prepped for surgery, but I stayed focused on my client and her needs.  Her husband was there, too, but scared (I can see his eyes now!).  One of the things I love about being around so much birth is offering normalcy to a strange situation for others.  He was scared, I smiled, and he relaxed... we did that dance a hundred times that night.  When my lady got to about 8 centimeters, she said she couldn't do it anymore... was just too exhausted.  For those of us in birth, we know that she is in the home stretch when she says that, but saying that to a woman who is in that scared place isn't so easy sometimes.  I sat with her... face to face... and told her she was strong, that she  could  do this, that she  was  doing this... and she began crying.  Next to us, separated by a mere curtain, the nurse was reading the waivers for surgery to the other crying woman who was getting ready for a cesarean.  Monotone and precise, her questions about allergies, dentures, spinal difficulties, etc. were read and somehow checked in the appropriate box.  My client looked at me desperately.  I looked her in the eye and something said, "help her!" and I said to her, "Look me in the eye... let me take this next contraction for you so you can rest" and she looked at me funny, but stared deep into my eyes.  As her contraction built, I felt a buzzing of Energy that started in my cunt and radiated outward, through my abdomen (uterus?), through my back, up my spine, into my heart, and pushed tears out my eyeballs.  She relaxed more and more with every passing second of the contraction as I let the Energy flow through me... "taking" her contraction.  She was pretty non-verbal during this phase of labor and after the contraction, I said, "That was great... your turn" and she was visibly frightened.  She begged me to take one more... just one more... that the rest had been perfect.  I told her "Only one more because this is your labor and you need to birth, not me" and she readily agreed and then the next contraction began.  We repeated the same scenario... staring deep into each other's eyes... hands touching... knees to knees... her man behind her touching her shoulders... and the contraction building as she released the Energy into me and I embraced it and loved it for her.  The contraction peaked, then subsided and she thanked me quickly and dropped her head and closed her eyes for a moment and then lifted her spirit for her own next contraction.  Within 10 minutes, she was pushing her baby out.  In Recovery, she went wild with her astonishment at what we had done.  While I was mildly fascinated with the transfer of energy, it wasn't totally foreign; but, new in birth.  She went on and on about how she had felt  no  pain during those contractions, but she knew she was having them... or rather, that  I  was having them... and she was just  so  excited!  The monotone nurse from the next curtain came in and took me aside.  I thought, "oh, crap... I'm in for it now."  The nurse tells me that she used to be a homebirth midwife and she had done Energy Transference many times in labors at home, but she had never seen anyone do it in a hospital.  She thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I was embarrassed!  The client heard the midwife/nurse and they began chattering away like birds in the morning on a telephone wire (which are almost obsolete, aren't they) and I had to ask them to please stop talking about it.  I didn't ever do that kind of overt Energy exchange again... in all these years.  I'm not sure it was right to do it.  I have often sat the woman's SO down in front of her (or her mother if she didn't have an SO there or if he was not a part of the birth experience) and had them do this Energy exchange without saying what I was asking for... I think that the intensity of love can just infuse the laboring woman with belief and power and energy... and unless I am the only choice, I don't really think that is my place.  The way she fawned over me was not right; her birth had been hers and I tugged a big piece out of it from her.  Now, can I sit in a room and push Energy towards a mom who is struggling?  You bet.  Do I?  You bet.  Do I save some for me?  Absolutely.  Unlimited giving is as dangerous as not giving at all.  Do I know how to replenish Energy from the earth?  Ayup.  Is it a skill midwives/birth workers/mothers/everyone should know?  Absolutely!  While I am glad I was able to help her through her intense exhaustion, I did things differently from then on.  What an amazing experience it was, though!

      I had just gotten to Casa for my second stint there (I had been there in 1993, but returned in 2002) and was just on my first shift as an Intern (under a Certified Midwife).  The baby had been born and I was in doing vitals and the kid was clearly in respiratory distress.  Tachypnea (fast breathing), retractions (the chest caving in), and nasal flaring (the nostrils spreading wide with breaths)... all signs of respiratory distress when, if left alone, can cause a baby to crash.  I snatched up the baby and took him to the midwife on duty who looked at the baby... took my stethoscope (a Littman, top of the line cardiac stethoscope) and listened to the baby.  She heard the rattles I did in this baby's lungs... counted the respirations as incredibly fast... but just said, "Let him nurse, he'll be fine" and pushed him back to me.  I was a tad distressed and blinked my disbelief at her.  Another hour went by (I never left the baby's side) and now the child was grunting (audible struggling for breath) and I took him back to the midwife.  She took my Littman and listened and then said, "Get me a sethoscope from the room" and, confused, I told her this was a Littman... that she would hear much better with this than the $15 ones in the rooms.  She said she knew what she wanted, to go get it.  So I did.  When she listened with the $15 stethoscope, she couldn't hear the rattles or the grunting anymore (she said).  "That's better!  He's fine.  Take him to his mom."  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  The baby did get better with time and oxygen (that I begged another midwife to let me use on the baby), but it was frightening watching a baby struggle for breath that way.   I am still amazed at the desire of some people for inaction in the face of danger or necessity... just to cover their butts.

      A woman came to us 2 days after 40 weeks pregnant needing a midwife. She had just moved to San Diego County and was a squatter on an organic seed farm. She and her man and her daughter shared a trailer with 2 other families high in the desert mountain country near the edge of SD County... about 2.5 hours from my home. In August, the temperature outside where she lived was 115 degrees.  2 days after meeting her, we were called to her home (I was a second assist, so there were 3 midwives) and drove out there to be with her as dawn was breaking, thankful for the air conditioning in our cars since it was already about 100 degrees.  The trailer was amazingly hot and stuffy and there were about a billion flies inside, so the client asked that the pool she wanted to deliver in, the ones we sell now, be set up outside under the Pepper Tree. We grabbed lawn chairs and sat watching her labor quietly and gently with her man at her side. Her daughter wasn't so interested in her labor, so played elsewhere on the property. The stranger-housemates, stayed inside the trailer making food. Periodically, the midwife would listen to the baby, but it was a relatively quiet and quick time we were waiting. The midwife also had her then 8-month old nursling there and would nurse her when she needed to.  As Birth Time arrived, the nursling went into the stroller and she sat and watched the entire birth, wide awake, and not making any noise at all. I was sitting back in a chair, the other midwives closer on their knees next to the pool that both mom and dad were in (naked). I'd been having some odd glucose issues of my own lately, so had a supply of unwrapped hard candies in my pocket.  As the birth unfolded, everything around us seemed to be silenced. The only sounds I heard were the leaves when the wind mercifully blew and the bees in the Pepper Tree... and mom's occasional tiny grunts as she brought her baby closer.  I began to feel funny, so popped a candy in my mouth. I felt more and more disconnected and feared fainting (thanking the goddess I wasn't in charge of the birth!) and kept popping candies in my mouth and sipping water from the water bottle. I felt my head swirl around and my body floating over the pool and I quickly grabbed my own grounding cord and shoved it into the earth to keep me from floating off the mountain!  The beautiful boy was born, nearly silently, in the water and I watched as the midwives were the most hands off I had seen in my time watching them do births. I was still feeling so high, I popped another candy in my mouth.  When the mom and dad had left the water to sit on a blanket under the tree and the placenta was born, the three of us went to the other side of the trailer (still outside) and ate some hot watermelon fresh from the garden. I thought my mouth was going to orgasm from the intensity of the flavor!  A few minutes go by and we begin whispering about the birth. I tell them how weird I felt and how I was glad I had the candies so I didn't have a hypoglycemic episode on top of the birth. They both looked at me and each other and they said that they, too, felt high and floaty! They both told of grabbing their grounding cords and digging deep to hold them down. My head swirled with the coolness of the universal-ness of this experience.  While I had not expected such a cool birth, this birth is one of the ones that sticks out in my memories as being one of the Holiest births I have ever been to. When I went back to do the one and three day visits (alone), I took my camera and took several pictures of the Pepper Tree with the circle-space where the pool had been and have that picture on my desk as a reminder of the Holy-ness that birth can and should be.  The mama wanted to lie in her bed, so we moved her to her part of the trailer and the father had installed a swamp cooler thingie (air conditioning was too artifical). It was only 95 degrees instead of 115. The flies were horrendous, however, and with a freshly bleeding mama, we had to do something about them.  The father was shoo-ing them out with a magazine. I asked where the fly swatter was and the entire trailer gasped saying they would never kill that indiscriminately. Whatever. So we watched as the trailer folk shoo-ed the flies out of the house with their energy and magazines. I wanted to roll those magazines and smash them. Karma be damned.  The mom and I were alone during the Fly Be-Gone Dance and she leaned over to me and whispered at one point. She said, "Please don't tell anyone, but when no one is here, I vacuum them up and let them die their natural death inside the vacuum bag." She was so ashamed at her inability to cope with a million flies... and that she wandered the house with the vacuum hose aloft, sucking in random flies so that they may die a natural death out of her hair and face... I hugged her tight and quick (we were sweaty!) and smiled gently and told her she was much kinder than I would be; I am sure her karma will remember her kindness. Inside, I was howling laughing at her justification and coping skills! I loved it!  Very shortly after, they moved on, but we just heard from her and she has had yet another birth... hopefully, getting her new midwife good and high on Birth Energy!

      Over the years, there have been some pretty amusing ways people pick their names. Family names, honoring dead relatives names, names that thank the nurse or midwife that helped during the birth, psychic talking to the babies, dreaming names, trying on names when the baby is born, using the names one knew they would use when they were 9 years old.  There is always the ever-popular waiting until the last minute to figure out the baby's name... 2 weeks?  6 months?  I have seen it.  One woman I assisted last year let her 2 year old decide the baby's name.  When we went to the home visit, there had to have been 60 pieces of paper with names all over the walls and windows. When a "name" popped into mom and dad's head, they would write it on the paper and pin it up. When the baby was born, the 2 year old pointed out the paper that had the name the baby was eventually named. I just shook my head and laughed. Cute name, though.  I have been to the coolest Baby Naming Ceremonies, too.  Babies that knew their names before any friends or family... dad whispering it into the baby's ear right before everyone else being told.  Baby namings that used to be called a Bris (the circumcision of the Jewish male) are becoming more popular as the "ritual" of circumcision falls further and further out of favor with even observant Jews.  I watched at Casa, over and over, as the Mexican women would name their babies after midwives that worked there.  When I was going by "gardenia," I didn't understand why no one named their baby after me.  Then, one nice older Mexican woman told me that gardenias were the official funeral flowers in Mexico (like Lilies of the Valley are here in the US).  I stopped calling myself "gardenia" on the spot.  I was even going to change it legally!   Still, no one ever named their baby "Barbara."  "Barbara" means barbarian... savage.  Fabulous in Spanish, ugly in English (to me).  Revivals of Mabel and Gertrude have occured, but Barbara remains in the Nursing Home crowd.  I remind myself, even as I removed the  Feral Mermaid  from my email address (the nickname I have had since my 1995 introduction to the Internet), I shall always remain Feral (Barbara).  I have had women fawn over my help for them in labor... the mother who was just in for the birth, telling the daughter... name her after the midwife! and the daughter looking over and saying, "Her name is 'Barbara'" and the mother saying, "How about Lucinda?"  laughing   I have watched little Mexican babies (whose parents spoke zero English!) be named Jeff, Courtney, Madeline, Tiffany, and Frank.  I have seen some odd names. Chlamydia being the grossest (Hispanic woman). Candida (there is a song with that name, too, so someone thought a yeast infection was yummy) was another odd one.  Cycles of Megan's (every spelling imaginable), Christopher's, Jennifer's, Michael's, and now even Tristan's (my son was the only one 21 years ago!) galore.  Lily's abound! And Talon's. And Isabella's.  Thank goodness the Tiffany craze is over. Can't you just hear the nurses in the Nursing Homes in 50 years? "Tiffany, ready for me to change your Depends?" "Brooke, time for your dinner, hon."  And then, everything old is new again. Sofie, Sofia, Edward, and other old names.  Thankfully, all my kids love their names. I did good! Tristan Ian, Meghann Alyssia, and Aimee Isabel. Yeah!

      One time when I was at Casa de Nacimiento for an extended period of time, Sarah came to visit and I asked her to watch me work.  Of course, everyone loved Sarah and she even assisted a couple births (those stories later).  This one however, had happened in the middle room and there were a  lot  of Interns there, the midwives, and me catching... and some family.  Probably 8 or 9 others besides the mom in this small room.  The Interns (and Sarah) were against the wall as they are instructed to be, just to watch... no talking.  The woman is having her baby... nice and gentle... me talking softly in Spanish... and the baby is born and goes up onto her belly as we do.  We are sitting and waiting for the placenta... the family yacking and giggling and looking at the baby and the mom tells me she feels like she has to push again.  Great! No problem.  When you feel that again, go ahead and push.  A contraction comes and I am waiting patiently for her placenta (something I wasn't often allowed to do) and, as she pushes, a HUGE HUGE explosion of blood comes projectile-ing out of her vagina... splashes all over me and around me... and  hits the wall  behind me (about 4 feet away!) where the Interns were standing!  Sarah, right behind me, has reflexes like an animal and ducked out of the way of the exploding blood.  I, on the other hand, was covered, from head to thighs.  My glasses were dripping, my nametag was full, my pen had blood inside it... and I could not move before making sure she was fine.  She was perfectly fine!  So, another midwife took over so I could go change.  Sarah came with me to the other side and began peeling the clothes and items off in the bathroom while I stood in the shower.  We laughed and laughed about how strange that was, but how cool she felt perfectly fine even with that much blood.  Then, Sarah reminded me that earlier in the day, another woman whose baby I caught, had lost less than a teaspoon during her birth and the birth of the placenta.  She kept the same chux throughout the actual births!  Unheard of.  Sarah says to me in a quizzical way:  Interesting the variations on the norm for blood loss during a birth.  Interesting, indeed.

      I had just sat in the office at Casa de Nacimiento making snide comments about midwives who don't use gloves.  When the others chuckled and said they just had babies come too fast, I smirked that they weren't paying attention to their woman enough to know that baby was coming out.  No one commented.  Not an hour later, a woman who had been early laboring along, but was alone without family, so had nowhere else to go to labor, asked for company to the bathroom.  I wasn't with anyone else so walked with her to the toilet... talking to her about her labor... and she was sleepily saying she was barely feeling anything.  I told her she could totally sleep for awhile more and then if things slowed down more, she could go back home.  She thought that was a good idea.  After she peed, we walked back the short distance to her room (the Bear Room for those that know) and then kinda screamed and I looked and saw the baby's head completely out in her chonis ("underwear" in Spanish)!!  There was another birth going on, so no one else was around but me and I yanked her chonis down and the baby fell out into my hands!  She was stunned and I laughed and hollered for someone to help.  A midwife running to the other birth threw me a chux as she dashed off and I wrapped the baby in the chux and then tried to figure out how to get this 4 foot 5 woman up onto the tall bed the Bear Room has...  and  get her baby between her legs and onto the bed (the bed was waist high for her!)... she was facing the bed, me behind with the baby and she said she was feeling funny.  I told her sternly she was going to climb onto the bed (getting on the floor was not a clean or sanitary option) and she would be strong so we could get her baby in her arms.  She stood up straighter and climbed up onto the bed (streaking blood and amniotic fluid along the way) and as she lifted her leg, I pushed the baby under it and gave her her baby.   I got the bed set up for her, worried about changing the sheets later, and once she was nursing her baby, she and I had a huge laugh!  I couldn't leave to go wash my hands because no one else was around, so used baby wipes, put gloves on, and caught the placenta; all alone.  Oh how the Universe shovels our words right back into our mouths sometimes!

      My best friend in the whole world, Anne, asked me to be at her birth.  This is 1985.  I had already been to a couple other ones and was fresh off my UC to Meggie in 1984.  I was delighted to fly from Tacoma to Orlando and remain for 3 months and wait, leaving behind a cheating husband and a failing marriage for awhile.  Anne looked small during the pregnancy and, despite meds, she had hyperemesis gravidarum.  Knowing Anne, I knew the hyperemesis was not an in-your-head thing because she is the least hypochondriac person I know in the world.  She didn't even complain about it until she was so ill she was fainting.  After being hospitalized for nutrition and fluids, she was released on meds to quell the nausea and vomiting.  Her baby was still very small; she barely showed her pregnancy until the 9th month.  When Anne went into labor, I had worked hard to brainwash her.  Tried to get her to have a homebirth, but she adamantly refused, but had a great doc who was doing births in his office and she worked at the hospital where she was delivering, so it was all cool for her.  I learned to not be so hauranging at this birth.   laugh    Anne called and said her water broke and she was going to the hospital per instructions.  I shook my head and told her it was too, too early... she should stay home if she wasn't having contractions.  She said her husband Kenny (another lifelong friend) was nervous and was driving her to the hospital.  I said I was on my way.  When I got there, Anne was gowned and sitting up in the bed.  I said, "You're 3" and she retorted, "I'm TEN and they are waiting for me to push!"  I almost fell over.  Her water had broken less than an hour earlier and she was sitting there in  no  pain.  I was just stunned.  When she began grunting, the doc came in and within 5 minutes, Roxie was born.  We all wept and it was delightful!  Roxie weighed about 6 pounds... small, but decent-sized.  Roxie did not want to nurse.  I was becoming a La Leche League leader at this point and was a major nursing mom to Meggie... very militant.  I worked my head off to get that baby nursing.  Once home, we worked non-stop... it was incredibly frustrating!  I called my LLL leader in Tacoma (Marie Foxton, my mentor!) and she suggested, after 1000 other things, that I try nursing Roxie and see what was happening.  When I put Roxanne to the breast, it was like nursing a butterfly!  Her suck was almost non-existant... she could barely latch and had even less suck.  I memorized that sensation and can feel it even now, 19 years later.  Within a week, Roxie had lost over a pound and was put on premie formula.  I offered to express, but Roxie was losing weight so fast, Anne chose the formula (I believe she chose rightly, but I would have done both).  Soon after Roxanne's birth, I had to go back and face my failing marriage, got pregnant with Aimee and subsequently delivered her one year to the day of Roxanne's birth (April 20 for both girls).  We moved to Frankfurt Germany 3 months after Roxie's birth.  I met Sarah (my partner/spouse) in Frankfurt when Aimee was 2 days old at a La Leche League meeting.  So, without the Internet and having to talk on phones across the ocean and being rather money-challenged, Anne and I didn't talk much.  She was busy, but mailed letters when she could.  Once Aimee was born, I talked to Anne who told me that something was wrong with Roxie, but no one knew what yet.  She hadn't rolled over front to back until she was 8 months old (!!!) and the pediatrician had reassured her that that was normal.  Roxie being her first kid, she bought it (didn't know the difference) and let it slide.  Her mom, a nurse, kept telling her something was wrong, but the ped was reassuring, so it went much longer than it should have.  By the time Roxie was a year, she was in The System and starting to be tested.  A huge battery of tests couldn't find a cause for her developmental delays and eyes that bounced all over the place, but, through discussions with the genetic counselors and specialists, two probably causes were found:  Hyperemesis Gravidarum (incessant vomiting) Toxoplasmosis (a parasite that is often found in cat feces)  Anne had several cats... I think 5 at the time... that were outdoor cats and constantly brought home "presents" of birds and rodents.  Most people who have cats their whole lives are already toxoplasmosis-immune (the infection manifests mildly like the flu), but rarely, it doesn't kick in until later in life... in Anne's case, probably during Roxie's pregnancy.   Toxoplasmosis is horrible when contracted in pregnancy and why caregivers ask about cats and gardening during the first prenatal visit.  Here is one link about toxoplasmosis:   urlLink http://www.womens-health.co.uk/toxo.htm   Roxie looked perfectly normal as a newborn until about 2.5 years old.  Then, her facial traits began changing and by the time she was 4, she looked profoundly mentally retarded.  I have not explored the mechanism behind facial changes after the birth, but find it fascinating that a child that looked absolutely normal for 2.5 years, now looks extremely retarded; it is obvious she is mentally challenged just on looks alone.  Roxanne did not roll over until after 8 months.  Sat up at 2.5 years.  Walked like a toddler at 4.5 years.  Didn't speak until 6 and still speaks as an 18 month old.  She didn't learn to use a potty until she was over 7 and still wears diapers at night.  She is 19 years old.  Roxie walks, runs, and laughs a lot.  She has some anger and is known to bite.  She is fully integrated into the family and has been in therapy since she was 18 months old.  She  loves  paper and folds all the time.  I joke about teaching her origami so she can be wealthy.  Anne has to hide plastic bags from her, too, because she loves their crinkling.  Reams of paper disappear as Roxie finds it and folds, folds, folds... she keeps stashes of paper like an addict hiding her drug of choice.  Because of the therapy, she signs more than she speaks, but Anne and the family (now 4 kids total and dad) encourage speech and it works.   Roxie and I adore each other; she loves my kids, too.  We lived with Anne for years when I was disabled... Her three kids (at the time), Kenny, Anne, me, my three kids, her 5 cats, my 2 cats, 2 other kids and their father out in the garage, and ONE bathroom.  It was amazing!  Anne would never turn us away and I have needed her a million times in my life; I can only pray I am a source of strength for her, too.  I will write separate stories of Anne's other births.  I was there for her 4th baby, LeeAnne (Lee Lee), 7 years ago.  What did I learn?  *  I learned that when I think something is wrong, get it checked out sooner than later.  Not that anything beyond therapy could have been done, but at least the information would be out there.  *  I learned to be more gentle about bottle feeding... that sometimes it saves lives.  Roxie would have died a natural death in another day and age.  She was nursing as she was because her genetics didn't want to stay on this earth.  *  That when a mom says, "I want to go to the hospital" to listen to her even if I think it is too early.  *  That when there is hyperemesis, to be more aggressive with meds and nutrition.  *  To test a woman with cats for her toxoplasmosis titer at the first blood draw.  *  That women  can  have painless labors and births (some call them "silent" labors).  Some women have painless labors despite zero preparation or meditation or visualization trying to manifest the same.  It was a moment of clarity that sometimes thoughts do  not  create reality after all.  *  That sometimes women don't whine or complain like me and I need to listen harder to what they are saying.  *  That sometimes docs are as clueless as the untrained eye.  When in doubt, find another eye.  *  That sometimes the person closest to God is handed the most shit on a plate and I gather strength from witnessing the pressing on of a life saddled with hardship and pain.  (Anne's husband Kenny is now totally disabled after a heart attack and then hospital-induced infection that caused pneumonia, heart failure, strokes, and months of fevers and over a year of hospitalization.  Anne never stopped for a second... kids to soccer and cheerleading, Roxie to Special Olympics, Lee Lee to tee ball, and they visited Kenny every single day for over a year.  I do not think I could have done all that.  Anne is more inspiration to me than she can ever understand even though I try and tell her... she laughs and blows me off.  It is just life to her.  I believe she is a Saint!)

      One of the most sensuous births I attended was with a mom who was American born Anglo, but converted to being Muslim for her husband.  During prenatals, we never saw more than her face... a round piece of whiteness amidst flowing robes and coverings; it was a normal matter of course.  When this mom came in in labor, however, within seconds, she was stripped naked and roaming around the room in her man's arms.  Then, in bed, they began making love.  Not intercourse, per se, but making  love .  The other midwife and I left the room after every required listen to fetal heart tones so they could continue their love making.  This mom was moaning, sighing... we could hear her in her lovemaking and it was definitely voyeuristic when we had to go in for vitals and such.  With averted eyes, we would do what we had to do and leave quickly.  They never paused even when we were there.  This dad was pulling on her nipples, touching her vagina (clitoris, most likely), licking her neck... nuzzling her, whispering to her... and this is just what we saw in the few moments during FHT checks!  It was yummy that he wanted her/loved her so much.  And surely assisted the oxytocin factor tremendously.  Mom had the only birth orgasm I have ever witnessed in 21+ years of birthwork.  Her baby was born over her orgasmic cries and it was amazing!  2 hours after the birth, mom, dad, and baby left the center (a few hours earlier than usual, but she was delighted to feel so good she could leave)... baby in the carseat and mom, once again, completely covered, head to foot, in her robes and coverings... except her glowing face flushed from her birth orgasms.

      I remember the client at the birth center who was a soprano.  Her voice was so beautiful!  During her pregnancy, she recorded a cd, but wouldn't let anyone hear it until after the baby was born.  Her labor was nice... she laid in the bed a lot.  In fact, she was from Martha's Vineyard and her mom who still lived up there, took a photo from outside the client's bedroom window, and had it blown up to fit the window of the room she wanted to birth in at the center.  Because she was lying down so much, we had to turn the picture sideways, making us dizzy, but her happy.  Once the baby was born, and I mean the MOMENT the baby was born, one of the assistants was asked to hit "play" on the cd player and this mama's lovely voice wafted out of the mechanism... singing lullabies to her brand new baby girl.  Her husband snapped a picture that remains on the great-selling cd to this day!  We all blubbered because it was so beautiful.

      Stream of consciousness here... (do I have any?)   *&nbsp; After interviewing 6 women for the Office Duchess position and choosing one, she came in for the second interview today saying a "large company" has offered her a job at 10 times the pay rate, but she is undecided... needs to go in to them for another interview.&nbsp; We have benefits they don't (holistic approach, etc.).&nbsp;  sigh    *&nbsp; A man I interviewed on the fly today (while I sat in the lobby with my head lolling backwards and my eyes nearly rolled into the back of my head from exhaustion) sounded PERFECT!&nbsp; 2 wonderful homebirths, loves holistic healthcare, etc., but wants to work weekends and do school full-time.&nbsp;  note to self: &nbsp; keep resume for when weekends are cranking!   *&nbsp; Jacqui (the outgoing Office Duchess) said she would really prefer to train someone in the next two weeks so she can have her mornings to study the colonic training thingies when she starts in 3 weeks, so if at all possible, please have the training completed.&nbsp; I'm trying!   *&nbsp; Our chiropractor, whom I have given untold pieces of marketing information in the last 2 weeks alone regarding being a chiro to the pregnant stars and who told us 3 weeks ago she wanted to "talk to us" and then reneged, told us (actually, she knew better than to talk to me... she met with Sarah alone)&nbsp;today she wanted out of her 18 month contract, of which a mere 8 months is fulfilled... so she can go work with her man 3 blocks down the street.&nbsp; I am  SO  angry there are not words.&nbsp; Betrayal, thief, and wimp are some that do come to mind.&nbsp; Where is her integrity?!?&nbsp; I swear to god, if she starts marketing herself as a chiropractor for pregnant women, I am just going to have to go have a cow patty on her new office stoop.&nbsp; And to think I encouraged her to doula, to take doula training with Gerri, gave her SO much of ME!&nbsp; I redesigned her brochure, for goddess' sake!&nbsp; I have written articles on ezines touting her.&nbsp;  Grrrrr &nbsp; I am just so pissed.   *&nbsp; Kinko's nearly killed Meghann and I because of our shirts needing their iron-on logos.&nbsp; They screwed them up last night (5 hours late anyway) and then she spent 2 HOURS at Kinko's trying to find someone that knew how to open the friggin' cds with the logos on them.&nbsp; Last night, when we went 5 hours later to pick them up, they tell us that two won't work... and I hollered "why didn't someone call me?!?" and I get a "we did try to call..." and I said, "I talked to you all twice for crying out loud! Why didn't someone say something in the afternoon so I could go get new shirts instead of telling me at 10 pm so now I have to race to Wal-Mart (which I despise, btw)!"&nbsp; "Oh, sorry" was about as much as I got out of them... though didn't have to pay for their mistakes either.   *&nbsp; So, after the Kinko's fiasco last night, we dashed to Wal-Mart (which I despise... did I already say that?) and found 2 shirts for Sarah, but not for Kim, so that meant a delightful early morning romp to Target.&nbsp; Goodie.&nbsp; We did, found the shirts, dashed to the Embroidery place, placed the order, and then drove through horrendous traffic to work and got there by 9:30.   *&nbsp; Started seeing people about 10:05 and the flow didn't stop until 4:45pm when I did a vaginal exam on a kinda not client, but acquaintance of a friend who doesn't believe the docs, but won't hire a midwife.&nbsp; She is trying for a VBAC and they want to induce next Thursday and she wanted me to help kick start her.&nbsp; I didn't because her cervix was high and that baby higher.&nbsp; She said it was the most gentle exam she ever had.&nbsp;  whew &nbsp; Nice to know I still know what a cervix feels like after all this time.&nbsp; (Not that it is crucial or anything.&nbsp;  laughing!!! )   *&nbsp; I'm washing our newly logo'd and embroidered shirts.&nbsp; Kim is picking up the ones that Kinko's is struggling with after she gets off work.   *&nbsp; We made Spec Pets.&nbsp; (A blogspot unto itself... more later.)   *&nbsp; The Massage Therapist is chronically depressed and swore she would come in to meet people and get some marketing done.&nbsp; After days and DAYS of crap, I told Sarah I wanted her GONE.&nbsp; She must have swirled her ass around a May Pole or something last night because she came in with make-up on, pressed scrubs, no clients on the books, but delightful and helped us make Spec Pets.&nbsp; I hope her days of 1. not showing up 2. not calling 3. coming in and grabbing a pillow and blanket and sleeping in Room 8 are OVER.&nbsp; Sarah asked me why I didn't go wake her up and tell her to do something.&nbsp; I bellowed (understatement) that I was FUCKING BUSY and didn't have a SECOND to go wake up a practitioner that couldn't DO anything but sleep and if SHE had that kind of time, then go for it.&nbsp; She called the woman herself.&nbsp; I kept interviewing and getting a thousand hundred things ready for the Fest this weekend.   *&nbsp; I am making little coupon thingies galore... one for Dyke Childbirth Classes, another for Queer Mom's Support Group, another as a Classified for a CHIROPRACTOR that won't stab me in the back, and then the coupons with PAY NOW! discount rates and coupons for if they come in from the fair.&nbsp; I am learning Publisher fast and furiously and love it!&nbsp; My Dyke Childbirth Class ones are the best!&nbsp; Sarah said some might be offended by the word "dyke."&nbsp; I said, "uh uh" when I really meant, "tough shit."&nbsp; I am in no mood.   *&nbsp; I have so much emailed piled up with tender mamas that are sharing their wounded hearts with me.&nbsp; I pray they forgive my tardiness.   *&nbsp; After a day without Pez, Aimee decided to go back to him and the apartment she was moving into with her friend is now not large enough and they are going to move into a 2 bedroom.&nbsp; I planned to go be with her on August 8 because Meggie leaves the 11th and Aimee said, "it wouldn't be a good idea."&nbsp; I stifled my sobs until after the phone call ended and then cried like a baby (a hurt mommy?) for 15 miles in 5 mph traffic.   *&nbsp; Mom is out of the hospital (I think).&nbsp; She had a horrendous lung infection and they considered intubating her.&nbsp; Apparently, they didn't.&nbsp; She must be on the Net because her line won't stop the annoying busy signal.&nbsp; Who in the entire Universe besides my mother still has dial-up for god's sake?!?&nbsp; With ONE LINE?&nbsp; I hate busy signals.   *&nbsp; The pregnant midwife is acting like she is an invalid and cannot come in for consults.&nbsp; I decided  I  will do consults now.&nbsp; Aren't I brave?&nbsp; She isn't even but 38 weeks, for crying out loud.&nbsp; She's gonna have big fun when she is pregnant with her 3rd and chasing 2 kids around.&nbsp; Whatever.   *&nbsp; I'm showing my bitter and tired side.&nbsp; Can ya tell?   *&nbsp; I still haven't cancelled my nasty 6 hour Full-Body CT scan for the morning.&nbsp; I haven't had a second to do it.&nbsp; They are gonna croak loudly when I don't show.   *&nbsp; One of my VBAC doula clients is moving to a big ol' house and after a LOT of introspection has decided to go ahead with an HBAC with me and Gerri and Jewel.&nbsp; I am ecstatic!!&nbsp; She is due in Nov.&nbsp; I am thrilled.&nbsp; She's a nurse and so is her family... that will be fun, too.&nbsp;  smile    *&nbsp; The client mentioned above reads my blog, too.&nbsp;  waving &nbsp; I have wondered if my sharing my blog with clients and such is a good idea since I am really pretty darned honest here.&nbsp; I don't want to hold back and don't want their eyes to cause me to censor myself, but I also know that most people rarely hear/see this nasty part of another human that is their caregiver or even friend.&nbsp; These thoughts and feelings are usually reserved for the loving ties of marriage or blood relatives.&nbsp;  laughing maniacally    *&nbsp; I have more ulcers on my tongue and nose again and my hair is just falling out in clumps.&nbsp; I am so disturbed, but don't have time to consider it except in the shower where my hair sheds into my hands and my tears fall down into the part of the drain my hair doesn't clog.&nbsp; My leg hair has stopped growing in most parts.&nbsp; I eagerly anticipate my pit hair's demise.   *&nbsp; I am so tired and so so so tired.&nbsp; I am scared that all this work and stress is going to just make me relapse and I cannot have that; don't have time!&nbsp; ( And you clients reading this, you are my joy and my light!&nbsp; You are the zero stress in this world for me ... it is working so much and so hard with nary a moment's preparation for this in my existance.&nbsp; Who the HELL decided to buy this business?!?)&nbsp; When I am asked when I am opening a birth center it is all I can do to not throw up and become hysterical laughing all at the same time.   *&nbsp; I want to turn another 2 rooms into colonics and a bathroom.&nbsp; Sarah says it isn't possible.&nbsp; I want to know why.&nbsp; I want to eliminate the issue of Marriage and Family Therapy.&nbsp; They are too hard to find.   *&nbsp; I am eating so many carbs, I am so glad I am on Diflucan so I don't scratch my woo woo to shreds.&nbsp; Ulcers, yeasties... ulcers, yeasties... actually dunno which is worse.   *&nbsp; I finally picked up my rx for the pill again.&nbsp; Meggie forced me to... telling me I was a leetle bit touchy.&nbsp; Crying at Charlotte's miscarriage on  Sex & the City  was the catalyst.&nbsp; I love that Charolette's clothes.&nbsp; Why aren't I demure and graceful like that?&nbsp; I am a cow with swinging udders in a china shop.&nbsp;  sigh    *&nbsp; I want a girlfriend.&nbsp;   *&nbsp; Trying so hard to Be Here Now regarding Meggie leaving.&nbsp; It is tough.&nbsp; I love her so much and she is SUCH a joy to be around and works SO hard.&nbsp; I am going to be so so alone without her.&nbsp; Sarah is working more and more and more... does she want me anymore?   *&nbsp; I miss friends.    tears falling    Gonna go watch Jeopardy.&nbsp; Is Ken still winning?

      I am in this place of trying to figure out what a doula really does.&nbsp; The hoopla around the country about doulas getting certified or licensed by this or that organization has prompted my continued thinking that women can and should be in a place of Power themselves during birth.&nbsp; If women felt power-full, then would we even need doulas?  I proposed this to a few of the women in my mom's group yesterday and got great responses.  One woman had a preemie and his birth was very traumatic and included the loss of this baby's sibling (another third of the triplets she was originally carrying).&nbsp; She said that when things went crazy, she was frightened and her partner was equally unable to be the translator during the craziness.&nbsp; Even something as simple as putting on the cd she wanted to hear... wanted the baby to hear... as he was being born... was forgotten in the distress.&nbsp; A doula, she said, would have remedied that.&nbsp; And she is right.&nbsp; She said that even if she has a planned cesarean next time, she will have a doula to help keep the flow kinder and their family's thoughts clearer at a time that can be overload.  I know that I lose a lot of processing in overload.&nbsp; I use the word "overwhelmed" a lot lately.&nbsp; I utilize those around me that know and love me to play the Fill-In-The-Blank game I play too much.&nbsp; I lose nouns and really worry about how I project myself in the company of clients and business associates.&nbsp; "Can you hand me that... uh... you know, that thing that holds paper together?"&nbsp; "Paper clip?"&nbsp; "Yeah! That's it!"&nbsp;  groan   Is that same sort of overload what happens to women in labor?&nbsp; Do we foster it with the mechanization of birth?&nbsp; Do we make birth so complicated we need a series of classes that we have to&nbsp;pass just&nbsp;to get to the birth itself?&nbsp; Do  we  make birth this way at all or is it&nbsp;the OBs and midwives (usually CNMs) that insist on medicalizing birth so that they are held aloft as the Fixers, the Healers, the Saviors?&nbsp; How can we unravel this silly string (absurd string!) and find some balance in that the doula doesn't become a necessity, but a luxury in-case-of?  What is my role in the brainwashing that women need a doula, a midwife, an OB?&nbsp; Is it brainwashing?&nbsp; Or experience?&nbsp; Creative fantasy?&nbsp; Or reality?  I am in correspondence with someone on a UC list who is having to listen to women who are so radical about UC they believe it is more important for a mother and baby to die than to seek help in pregnancy, labor, birth, or postpartum.&nbsp; She is distressed and cannot begin to counter their intense volume of the What Can Happens in labor.&nbsp; I asked if she thought my laying out a What Can Happen blogspot would be good... one for homebirth and another for hospital birth.&nbsp; She thought that would be good!&nbsp; I will work on that later.  My day is interviewing receptionists since Jacqui leaves for colonic therapy training in 3 weeks.&nbsp; In two, we take Meggie back to Texas.&nbsp; This weekend is the Gay & Lesbian Fest and we are making coupons, gift certs, etc. preparing for the show.&nbsp; It is fun, fun, fun, but  long  hours and a lot of hot work.&nbsp; I pray we get a million clients from it this year.&nbsp; Last year we held aloft the pics of babies coming out of vaginas and scared the shit out of the fags and dykes!&nbsp; Femmes loved them, the butch dykes freaked.&nbsp;  laughing &nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; I got to show how babies&nbsp; really  come out and how glowing smiles are a part of birth, not screaming and drugs.&nbsp; Sarah said I can't show that this year.&nbsp;  sigh   More later... off and running!

      There is this belief that women in labor, especially once they are in kicking labor, are unable to make decisions for themselves... that they cannot remember to pee or drink or change positions.&nbsp; The belief unfolds even further in that women seem to hire a midwife so that she is able to guide the energy of the labor and birth when (not if) the woman goes into that place of Other-Worldly-ness.&nbsp;  Birthing From Within  fosters this belief... a book I love!&nbsp; Whole paradigms foster this belief.&nbsp; Birth plans foster it.&nbsp; Doulas foster it.&nbsp; Dads as Coaches foster it.&nbsp;   Is this paradigm reality?   ( Paradigm :&nbsp;  a set of deeply held beliefs; usually someone else's )   Women who UC know when to pee and move and shift and wiggle and touch and poop and get into and out of the water.&nbsp; Women who UC in other cultures (they call it "birthing") know how to do these things, too.&nbsp; I acknowledge that our culture doesn't see birth in its normalcy like other cultures might (tribal or migration cultures), but can our bodies be so inherently disassociated that we don't even feel when we have to pee anymore?&nbsp; If the woman was so disassociated when  not  in labor that she didn't know she had to pee, I might buy that she might not know when in labor, but that isn't whom we are speaking of.&nbsp; We are talking about women in their right minds and bodies... merely in labor... a process made to perfection (most of the time).   Is it my job as a midwife to be the Energy Shifter?&nbsp; Is it my job to say to a woman who has remained in bed for 5 hours (or 20 minutes) that it is time to get up and move so her labor will pick up?&nbsp; Is it my responsibility to offer her sips of water between contractions?&nbsp; Will a woman who is dehydrated not know she is and find herself, eventually, dangerously dehydrated?&nbsp; Where does that belief originate?&nbsp; If I can see a baby is posterior (or hear it with fetal heart tones), is it my job to offer ideas to turn the baby?&nbsp; When does that responsibility move to me and away from mom?&nbsp; Is she offering her Power to me so that I can assist with my knowledge and experience?&nbsp; How do I hold her Power in honor and love without her feeling like she failed?&nbsp; If I see the bladder full, do I assume she can't feel it and ask her to pee? How do I traverse that woman's journey with her without leading her by a leash?&nbsp; Is asking enough?&nbsp; Should I even ask at all?&nbsp;   This is today's concern.&nbsp; How can I discover what a woman can and cannot say in labor if most women are brainwashed/convinced in childbirth classes, by doulas, by midwives, and&nbsp;by OBs that they don't know what they feel?&nbsp; Whom do I ask?&nbsp;   With my clients I have now that are pregnant, do I begin with, "When you are in labor, I will let (probably a sucky word, but after trying different ones, I came back to "let")&nbsp;you guide the Energy... you tell me when you have to pee or drink... you tell me what you need from me."&nbsp; (I can hear some clients now!&nbsp; "What am I paying you for?!&nbsp; Aren't you my caregiver?&nbsp; Why would  I  be the one to know when I need to pee... isn't that what I hired you for?")&nbsp; How in the world do I come off as someone who is encouraging the retention of Power as opposed to someone who wants to slack on the job I was hired to do?&nbsp; When does the discussion begin for a client?&nbsp; At the first meeting?&nbsp; The interview?&nbsp; Do I take clients that only want to retain their Power?&nbsp; Or do I take clients that want the gamut of "care" and then gradually release the Power they gave me back to them (or not take it in the first place).&nbsp;   I work to offer choices, of course, but that is different than the Here and Now of labor and birth where the midwife is  assumed  to take control of the Energy... it was what I was trained to do!&nbsp;   A discussion on a doula list right now is about doulas&nbsp;not buckling under to the hospital protocols... not signing them... so they (doulas)&nbsp;can stay autonomous and represent the laboring mom in her time of need.&nbsp; What happened that we believe women cannot speak in labor?&nbsp; When did that happen?&nbsp; I have heard women in labor be  very ,  very  expressive of their needs.&nbsp; Why do we think that it is an oddity that they would speak up sometimes and not others?&nbsp; What is it that we who work with laboring and birthing women think we have to be the translators for the client... translating medicalese... translating their own body's signals (or lack thereof)?&nbsp; Why can't we share the information prenatally... offer an OB dictionary so they understand the language being spoken around them in labor... role playing telling the caregiver to " SPEAK TO ME  since  I  am the one in labor here!"&nbsp; Why is there information we don't share?&nbsp; Why do we concentrate on the biomechanics of labor and birth instead of the path to remembering our Power and capabilities in times of stress?&nbsp; Wouldn't that benefit humanity much more than how big 10 centimeters is?  I often say that, in my doula role, I am a walking childbirth class... a sort of cheat sheet should something be forgotten or misplaced during the stress of labor.&nbsp; I would like to see myself like that as a midwife, too.&nbsp; Just an augment... a place to turn when confusion is the emotion of the moment... but, ultimately, returning the Power to the laboring mom/baby/couple/family... as they get their balance again.&nbsp; Similar to when I helped Donna when she was saying she was scared at the end of her labor.&nbsp; I could have gone in and touched and "helped," but, instead, I believed in her... and let her know she could do it... that it was okay, that fear... that she could hold it&nbsp; and  birth her child.&nbsp; And she did just that and she soared with that experience!  And so did I.&nbsp;

      As I write in the lists about the upcoming ICAN/CAM/BRN Conference, the topic of UC keeps coming up (as mentioned in a previous blogspot) and I would love to develop something revolving around that topic... I think connected to birthrape, too.&nbsp; I need to lay out some ideas.   This from another list where the UC discussion is unfolding:    The topic is my seeing another viewpoint... that my saying that UC isn't safe is no different than a doctor saying he advocates homebirth, but... he has seen some dangerous things and just can't really suggest women do it.&nbsp; The woman wants me to see that perhaps I am not the best person to bring up UC even though I have had one. &nbsp;   There is absolutely no difficulty in my hearing your thoughts... at all.&nbsp; Things you have said are nothing new, of course, but bear repeating... and I am hear to listen.&nbsp; I know that the discussion we are having will help me formulate a fantastic workshop on As   Midwifery As It Is    vs.    Midwifery   As It Could Be  .&nbsp; UC as a choice... especially as a feeling of forced choice... is imperative to what a midwife can do to wake-up and Be the caregiver a woman wants and needs her to be.&nbsp; Too many women are manipulated or coerced in birth and I acknowlege that and want to bop some midwives on the head to wake them up!&nbsp; I can't do it across the world personally, but I can sure try with my words in writing and speaking.&nbsp; You and others here and elsewhere (including the women in my past doula/midwife-life) are all spirits that help guide me to what I feel my &nbsp;true  calling is... reminder of our perfection.   What I have to offer in that reminder, however, is that I am deeply rooted in the belief of technology  in its place .&nbsp; My clients tell me that they know if they transport, they damn well needed to be in the hospital.&nbsp; I beam when I look at where I am as a midwife right now.&nbsp; Not that there isn't  always  room for growth, but I am reveling in my evolution today.    The woman prompts that the only essentials in birth are the woman and the baby and that anything... people, meds, things, etc. are "technology."    I often encounter the "Birth Is Natural and If We Left It Alone, It Would Be Perfect" discussion.&nbsp; This is often followed closely by "Our Bodies Instinctively Know What To Do."&nbsp; I agree in theory, BUT, these bodies aren't what they were 500 or 500 thousand years ago.&nbsp; The grand majority of these bodies in North America do not live like our bodies were made to live.&nbsp; I often use  Dances With Wolves  or my new analogy,  Girl With The Pearl Earring , as examples of what our bodies were meant to do:&nbsp; walk to the river for water, make our dishes, plant our food, weed the garden, harvest miles from our home, cook everything from scratch, migrate twice a year across the continent, starve in winter, feast in summer, walk, Walk, WALK miles and miles a day.&nbsp; Sacagawea, at 14 years old with her newborn, walked with the Lewis & Clark Expedition an average of 16 miles a day!   Instead, most of us in this culture sit... at the computer, in front of the tv (in a recliner), in SUVs (in a too-reclined position)... walking to the end of the driveway for the paper is a complaining chore!&nbsp; Pregnant women especially get so little exercise it scares me.&nbsp; (I was one of them, please know that.&nbsp; I was over 300 pounds with each kidlet.)&nbsp; Our diets are dramatically different than our bodies were made to digest... fast food, processed food... even organic foods suffer from pollution, soil depletion, etc.&nbsp; We inhale toxins, eat toxins, sit on toxins that our ancestors couldn't have imagined in their worst nightmares!&nbsp; Evolution just doesn't happen that fast that we would have different birthing instincts from a foremother 1000 years ago.&nbsp;   I rarely saw posterior babies 20 years ago.&nbsp; Now, whole books are written on the subject and it is a common topic of discussion amongst pregnant women.&nbsp; If we cleaned animal skins on our hands and knees, gardened, picked veggies, etc. posterior babies wouldn't be nearly as common.&nbsp; But, we don't, so we have to simulate it with pillows and exaggerated sitting positions to try and avoid posterior babies.    Sometimes extra is horrible.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; Sometimes extra is fantastic!&nbsp; And yes, the indiscriminate use of technology SUCKS.&nbsp; The judicious use, however, can and does save lives.&nbsp; Seeing everyone as a potential tragedy is just as wrong as believing that every birth when left alone will go off without a hitch.&nbsp; Babies and mamas died without midwives way back-a-when.&nbsp; Midwives  were  only called when needed, but it was usually too late for one or the other of the birthing couple.&nbsp; It is how midwives began attending births during the labor, so they could catch a potential issue before someone died.&nbsp; Does it mean midwives have to be all in the space with hands in and on the mom?&nbsp; That is where my own walk is taking me and I shout a resounding NO!&nbsp; (There are, of course, the legal issues I haven't even touched on and that is a whole 'nother topic of Midwifery With the Law Hanging Over Your Head.)    The poster mentions mothers and babies that would have been alive or healthier had they been at home or left alone at home.    Oh, absolutely!!!&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; From birthrape to infection to death... I have seen and heard all that you say.&nbsp; I do not discount that  at all .&nbsp; You are absolutely right and that what you shared in that paragraph  MUST  be said in this hypothetical workshop I am writing... absolutely.&nbsp; You are more right than you know.&nbsp; I despise that the norm in birth is the hospital.&nbsp; I get sick to my stomach thinking of all those normal women lying like gutted fish in the infection and impersonal clanking, stinking hospital.&nbsp; I am totally on your page there.&nbsp;   Whew.&nbsp; Lots to say about this.&nbsp; I should write a book.&nbsp;  laughing &nbsp; You all are great to listen.&nbsp; Thanks lots.&nbsp;    I actually would like to impart that UC as a forced non-option could be remedied by a midwife who was hands-off and who allowed things to unfold normally and be there only if needed or asked.&nbsp; The law, of course, is another matter altogether!&nbsp; Is this coming together as a topic for speaking or&nbsp;am I muddying the water considerably?

      A high school friend emailed that she looked around my website and was amazed at my work and that I was one of a few that made a difference in the world from our high school.&nbsp; She runs an ABC affiliate's camera department... handing out assignments, etc. and I make a comment about that near the end of my comments to her.    It's funny... I just don't even know how I fell into midwifery, in love with migrant women, in love with service to other human beings.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   For so much of my life, despite compassion, I was so self-centered and selfish, I just don't even know where the push to midwifery service occurred!&nbsp; I am often asked how I got into it and I have no clear answer.&nbsp; Circumstances put me in birthing women's lives, yet it took until a move and a second child before Life's mallet hit hard enough on my head that,  oh! you want me to be a midwife?!&nbsp;    &nbsp;   In my childhood, I could never in a thousand million years, have imagined a life assisting women in finding their path through the rite of passage called birth.&nbsp; I still shake my head in amazement (and confusion!).     &nbsp;   But, that was the long way around to thanking you for the very kind compliment about my calling.&nbsp; It is a miracle being asked into women's/family's lives during a year of change and transition and joy and a walking through fear; I am so blessed.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   You tell the story in a different way... through pictures.&nbsp; I speak through words (written and spoken).&nbsp; Your storytelling isn't any less valid.&nbsp; And I depend on your medium a LOT... wish I had more access to it because the standard press is so immune to the real ways of birth, we are on a mountain climb to show that what you see on tv (even un-reality birth shows) is&nbsp; not  how birth can or should... or even  is ... when the women are loved and cherished and respected to birth in their Power.    As we plan the 2005 Reclaiming Our Choices in Childbirth Conference (a combined International Cesarean Awareness Network, California Association of Midwives, and Birth Resource Network conference), we are still coming up with dream speakers and one name that came up in several circles was Joni Nichols who is a midwife working with an OB named Jose Luis down in Guadalajara, Mexico.&nbsp; Joni happens to travel to the US periodically and has a home in Newport Beach, California (about an hour from me here in San Diego).&nbsp; Joni came down on Thursday and Gerri and I met with her for about 4 hours and discussed many aspects of birth and the conference and life.&nbsp; We talked Joni into coming to the conference as a speaker and I had already formulated what I wanted her to speak about... she was humble and I had to ask her to move the humility... we all knew she was, but that she had stuff to say and she needed to say it!   This is a portion of what I shared with the Conference Committee regarding the topic I would like her to speak on:    I asked Joni to speak on some aspect of how to stay in the sun when the medicalization of birth was eclipsing the natural beauty that was possible. While Joni works in a bubble-like environment with an OB, she does have to function with medicalized birth all around her as the rest of us who do birthwork do... how does she stay so idealistic? How does she keep smiling and believing that all the women who need to be at her birth center are there? How do you stay faithful despite the pressures to conform or change your practice/protocols? I want her words to inspire caregivers AND clients... the focus she demonstrates in the unwavering belief of the perfection of birth... the perfection of a woman's instincts... I believe many people need to hear her words.     &nbsp;  I am working on this Conference and am formulating a proposal of my own regarding speaking about Hands-Off Midwifery (I need a new name... think!).&nbsp; UC was requested as a workshop and this is my response:    I had a UC with my second child in 1984.&nbsp; I am in a place of transition as a midwife from a Hands-On to a Hands-Off midwife (Gerri and I together, actually!) and am writing extensively about it.&nbsp; I, however, am not supportive of UC and have major issues about that as a choice for women.&nbsp; Now, I know that is a horrible thing to say as a proponent for choice in every aspect of birth, but it is how I feel.&nbsp; Mind you, I am on a couple of lists where many, if not most, women UC and I offer any information they ask me (how to do cervical checks, how to get out of prenatal tests, how to work a shoulder dystcocia when alone, etc.) because I believe everyone has a right to the information... it is not proprietary information by any means.&nbsp; I am not a knowledge hawg!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   But (and this is often a cop-out line, I am aware of it as I say it out my lips), I have seen too much to encourage women to UC.&nbsp; I do not believe a midwife has to have her hands all over a birthing woman and that the birthing woman can take major responsibility for her own and her child's safety, but on a very small list I am on (250 members),&nbsp; two  women have had their babies die during UCs that they  know  (their admission) would not have happened with a midwife there.&nbsp; A midwife can sit in the other room.&nbsp; A midwife can sit right outside the door of the home.&nbsp; But a midwife or someone trained (doesn't have to be anyone licensed) can save a life or two when nature does its random-ness as she is wont to do.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Natural is beautiful!&nbsp; But, even earthquakes and tornados are natural... and can be devastating depending on where you are in relation to those natural acts.&nbsp; We have a brain to use.&nbsp; I advocate for brain usage.     My own UC was a shoulder dystocia that required EMS and extensive resuscitation... neither of which would have been necessary with a trained person there.&nbsp; Sure it colors my view, but doesn't everyone's experience color theirs?     I am in an interesting place as a midwife right now.&nbsp; I am being confided in regarding something called "birthrape."&nbsp; Long story, but birthrape is the act of penetrating or assaulting a woman in labor and birth without her permission or with her direct refusal at such offenses.&nbsp; I have been asked to write an article (and am in the middle of it) for  Midwifery Today  and other magazines ( Mothering ) and am hearing stories of hate and anger and horrible abuse and post-traumatic birth/stress disorder... and I am holding those stories tenderly and lovingly as I reach out with my words to expose what doctors, nurses, and MIDWIVES do to abuse women during pregnancy, labor, birth, and postpartum.     I would love to be part of a panel discussing&nbsp; why    women would choose UC... discussing birthrape... but cannot advocate a workshop on&nbsp; how  to do a UC... that is too deeply unsafe for me.&nbsp; I don't have all the right words (despite writing a couple hundred of them!).&nbsp; I don't mean to offend anyone about their choice of UC and the women on my lists know how I feel about it, but I&nbsp; am  respectful of their choices... and am there to answer their hundred questions throughout the pregnancy.&nbsp; But, I am not&nbsp; there  (where they live)&nbsp;so cannot offer my services as a homebirth hands-off midwife.&nbsp; Here, however... if we had a conference here... I could not advocate UC after hearing local stories of pain and suffering that might have been relieved with another knowlegable caregiver/friend.    Off to work at the office... Queer Mom Support Group today.&nbsp; More later!

      Michael came for a week yesterday.&nbsp; I hope he lightens up.&nbsp; We are going to Disney today (California Adventure) and Meggie told him he was gonna have to listen to Disney tunes along the way and he said he doesn't "do" Disney tunes.&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; Well, if you are a part of this family, you sing Disney on the way to the parks... just the way it goes.&nbsp; I told him as much, too.&nbsp; He said he would wear head phones... I told him he would sing.&nbsp;  laugh    Meggie took Aimee her Income Tax check last night... Aimee is staying in Mission Beach until they move into this new place Saturday.&nbsp; I don't know when we will be taking her her boxes, but I sure miss her.&nbsp; Meggie said she was skinny.&nbsp;  sigh and frown &nbsp; I will make sure we bring her food... brownies!&nbsp; I miss my baby.&nbsp; Apparently, Aimee called Bo and asked for money; he did not give her any.&nbsp; She tried to get Meghann to go to a "party" on Saturday, but Meggie declined and said she would be willing to do other things with her like go to the beach and stuff.&nbsp; I don't know what will come of any of it.   Meghann and Michael will have the car this weekend and I have to work on the CAM/ICAN/BRN Conference.&nbsp; Tonya Jamois gave me my assignments and I have to get on them... inviting folks to speak, getting things in order for vendor opportunities, etc.&nbsp; I also have to re-work some of the website to try and reach more people.&nbsp; When I Google, I still don't see Ama Mama for midwifery in San Diego and it is making me crazy with worry that we are being missed!&nbsp; I wish I had a marketing degree, but suspect my slogging through is as much learning as I need.&nbsp; I'll just keep going.&nbsp; I am playing catch up and am a tad panicked about our finances right now.

      I am sure this is of no interest to anyone but me, but hey, what's a blog anyway, right, if not self-indulgent?  &nbsp;  *&nbsp; When faced with someone bragging about their hefty bank account, one might ask: so, how is your spiritual bank account?  &nbsp;  *&nbsp; I felt so good being brave enough to tell the bullies how mean they were to me in school.&nbsp; One said, "yeah, I remember throwing trash on you."&nbsp; Meghann, in listening to the story, said she couldn't believe there wasn't an "I'm sorry" attached to the comment.&nbsp; I wasn't surprised at all.  &nbsp;  *&nbsp; Some memories are better left in the past.&nbsp; The boy I adored and martyr'd for throughout high school who is now a raging alcoholic and shell-shocked from the military service... who talked to no one and everyone all at once... who looked homeless and very, very sad... I would rather have left him alone in my head&nbsp;25 years ago.  &nbsp;  *&nbsp; It was frightening how much some people hated themselves that they had to drink so much to cope with being back in high school.  *&nbsp; 8th grade came back with a vengeance as the chicks all danced together and the guys stood on the periphery drinking and gawking at the girls with their plastic navel oranges&nbsp;embedded in their chests.&nbsp; Very weird how the guys were still nervous talking to&nbsp;the girls.  *&nbsp; Life danced in with an old&nbsp;math-classmate... we were all near comatose with boredom when DD&nbsp;wiggled in and was a fool as he used to be (more than a class clown!).&nbsp; We all laughed our heads off as he bounced around the room laughing and playing like a child.&nbsp; We stopped laughing when he started drinking everyone else's drinks on the tables and I sighed when I heard he drank complete stranger's drinks at a bar the group went to after the reunion ended.&nbsp; Very sad.&nbsp; Not so funny, after all.  *&nbsp; Privately, I told my 6th grade love that she was my first&nbsp;real love&nbsp;and she was very touched by my sharing that.&nbsp; I told her that she was the first inkling that I didn't have to love a boy and I thanked her for being on my walk in life.&nbsp; She said she was glad she could influence me and I laughed and said she wasn't an influence... merely was her kind and loving self and that was what I needed at the time.&nbsp; She, a reflection of what I could be in another's eyes.&nbsp; It would take another 20 years before I believed it.  *&nbsp; I told several of the spouses stories of their husband's/wive's childhood stories... sharing my joy.&nbsp; I loved sharing the good stuff.&nbsp; So many shared crap, I thought it important to tell great stories of kindness and understanding and patience, too.  *&nbsp; I loved how many people were there in&nbsp;my first grade class.&nbsp; I can't get over the number of people I went to school with for 12 years!  *&nbsp; I cried when I heard Guy Goedde died.&nbsp; Several classmates are gone, but Guy Goedde was an important part of my life for a long time (he was a great drummer from 7th grade on) and I will miss his soul on this earth.  *&nbsp; I hated hearing how many people wouldn't come to the reunion because they were fat.&nbsp; I thought that part sucked.&nbsp; I wish I could hug them all and love them for who they are!  *&nbsp; Except for a rare few, take your high school class, throw 50 pounds of fat on everyone, amplify their high school behavior, sew on some fake boobs, add alcohol and cigarettes and that is what you have to look forward to at reunions.   Whee.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      One of our friends just had her baby and it was a cesarean.&nbsp; My crunchy friends, trying to be supportive, keep dropping the subject line in their congratulations and the words bounce around my skull like so much chatter and trapped sparrows.&nbsp; I wasn't at the birth, but the way the story was told, I think she was gypped.&nbsp; I think she wasn't given the time necessary to birth normally.&nbsp; I think someone along the way pulled out a graph... a study... a protocol that said:&nbsp; your time is nearly up... hurry up or you are gonna get cut.&nbsp; It reminds me of the long-standing Bradley un-joke about telling a man he better hurry up and orgasm or he will have his penis cut apart to get to the sperm; who is going to be able to relax enough to find their own end?&nbsp;  &nbsp; I am saddened and wonder if anyone will ever whisper that she might want to look at her experience as something other than perfect.&nbsp; I think another one of our cesarean moms hinted that and I was glad of that... but, is it   always     our job to preserve their experience/illusion/delusion of their perfect birth?&nbsp; Is it my lot in life to second guess birth stories?&nbsp;  laughing &nbsp; How come some women discover they were screwed during the birth and others take years?&nbsp; I know it took me years and years and years... and it had to unfold all on its own.&nbsp; It is what keeps me writing about it instead of hollering about it. &nbsp; But, oh... do I ever want to scream.&nbsp; Hear me?

      After the oddest time at the Class Reunion, Sarah and I spent the day with family and friends of choice.&nbsp; Mom, Rich and his family, Amy and her girls, dad, Anne and Kenny and Roxie and Lee Lee (Nikki Anne and Kenny Dean are in Michigan with grandparents), and Teresa all hung out for hours at Rossi's Pizza; god, we love that place!&nbsp; Another high school friend brought her daughter who is interested in midwifery and she and I talked for a few minutes about what a midwife is... good and bad.&nbsp; I couldn't spend lots of time on them, but it was a nice speech I gave.&nbsp;  laugh &nbsp; I should write it down.&nbsp; Suzanne and her new partner Dawn came early as did Suzanne's former partner Cristi... Suzanne and Cristi also having had gastric bypasses... it was good. &nbsp; I had a "come to Jesus" meeting with Amy (my sister) about her needing to MOVE in her life... doing something with it even though she is in chronic pain and drugged to the gills.&nbsp; She was asking why she is in menopause at 40 and if I was done with mine and I looked at her and told her I hadn't even begun!&nbsp; I told her she was too thin to have periods and she tried to debate me: I've gained weight!&nbsp; Well, goodie, but you are still too thin for a period. I talked to Amy about her wanting to die... her suicide attempts... that she  was  our mom and how fair is that to her girls?&nbsp; How did  she  like it when  we  were kids?&nbsp; She made excuses, but cried and cried and I told her to quit blaming mom and get off her ass and make the life she wants if she hates the one she has.&nbsp; I told her she was going to lose her kids... perhaps not physically, but spiritually, if she didn't shape up.&nbsp; I hope she heard me.&nbsp; I didn't cry at all.&nbsp; I was strong in my words and it might have sounded rehearsed, but wasn't at all... just words that needed to be said and no one in my family is brave enough to blurt out. &nbsp; I then took Ashley aside and talked to the tough 17 year old.&nbsp; My sister's child is my sister all over again.&nbsp; I told Ashley I was pissed that no one would talk to her the way I was going to and I was too far away to do much, but she was going to listen to me since I was her aunt.&nbsp; Cocky, she said, "I know" several times before I asked her to shut up and just listen. &nbsp; I told Ashley our family was a fucked up mess... mother and grandmother included.&nbsp; I told her that avoidance of issues was an important coping mechanism and that I didn't play that game and it made the family angry a lot.&nbsp; I told Ashley that her mother hated her life... that it had NOTHING to do with her even if my sister said it did.&nbsp; ("I know.")&nbsp; I told her that my mother tried to kill herself twice and I was the one to find her and Ashley told me she had found Amy twice... my turn to say "I know."&nbsp; I told her she was living my life with my mom... one of a drug addicted parent and suicidal and depressed... but that she did NOT have to live that way herself.&nbsp; I told her about therapy and loving one's self and self respect and not allowing people to take your soul from you (parents) and keeping your soul and body sacred even as you make choices to share it or your mind with others.&nbsp; I made sure she knew about Planned Parenthood.&nbsp; I talked to her about self-medicating and how that led to a life of Amy and grandma.&nbsp; I told her she could call me ANYTIME at any hour and that she could just scream in the phone and hang up if she needed to.&nbsp; I told her that I would listen, with open heart... that I wouldn't mince words... that I will not pretend drugs or depression or suicide don't happen in our family. &nbsp; I think it was the first time anyone had been real about our weird friggin' family in her whole life despite giving my mom a script with which to talk to Ashley when she called 911 to come take my sister to the ER.&nbsp; I wish I could do more and told her as much.&nbsp; At least someone talked to her; no one told me a thing about how sick it all was until I paid a therapist years later who unveiled the sickness. &nbsp; Need a mental break.&nbsp; More later.

      Surreal.&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; Odd.&nbsp;  &nbsp; All words to describe seeing people from my youth (including several that were in my first grade class in 1966!!).&nbsp; We looked the same, just older.&nbsp; Some people hadn't changed one iota.&nbsp; Others have had so much plastic surgery you couldn't tell they had once been human. &nbsp; What would possess a 43 year old woman to wear the tightest, shortest jean shorts and tightest, braless-ist halter&nbsp;top to a reunion?&nbsp; Oh yeah, (what she would consider... and others would consider...) dog status in high school.&nbsp; It was a hoot seeing how people's insecurities are still at play.&nbsp; The man who wore his shirt open to his belly button so we could see his hairy virility... and spoke incessantly of his million dollar back account (yeah, right).&nbsp; The people who were SO SO mean to me in school as I was growing up because I was fat and noisy and opinionated (I know, shocking how I've changed) and how they thought being a midwife was so cool... how I looked so pretty... how it was okay to actually seek me out for a conversation.&nbsp; Just weird. &nbsp; Although, there was the dyke factor.&nbsp; I could see people's faces become clouded as I introduced them to Sarah as my partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, shit! I was in the locker room with her for 6 years!"&nbsp; (Like I&nbsp;cared.)&nbsp;  laughing  &nbsp; And the alcohol.&nbsp; Could there have been any more drinking?&nbsp; Only the Catholic minister and I remained sober.&nbsp; Oh, and the recovering alcoholics... Sarah saw them since she took a billion pics for me.&nbsp; Smokers, druggies, alcoholics, drinkers, band geeks... there were still groupings as if we were in junior high.&nbsp; Guys did not dance until late into the evening (and much alcohol had been consumed).&nbsp; Girls danced with girls just as we did in 8th grade... guys gawking on the periphery... drooling over the former classmates that had been re-born as&nbsp;Barbie Dolls.&nbsp;  &nbsp; At one point, a friend dashed into the circle and asked naively... so, who do you think has had plastic surgery?&nbsp; I thought she was joking.&nbsp; I began pointing out massive melon breasted women (a migration of hard, circular flesh) and she was flabbergasted.&nbsp; I told her that Sarah and I got to see a ton of naked chicks between us and we could pick out plastics from 100 paces.&nbsp; She asked again... who else?&nbsp; And I laughingly lifted my skirt and showed my dangling thighs and asked... and who NEEDS plastic surgery and hasn't had it yet?&nbsp; I scared the group and several howled as they skittered away.&nbsp; My friends with kids and I laughed about needing scaffolding, but finding our kids' lives more expensive at the moment. &nbsp; I almost feel defiant in NOT getting plastics now!&nbsp; I know that my issue is a tad different... cosmetic is not what mine is (reconstructive), but still.&nbsp; My draping arm and leg and belly flesh were amusing to me last night as I overheard women saying I should have kept my 3/4 length sweater on.&nbsp;  laughing &nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; I worked hard to empty that skin. &nbsp; I took mental notes all night.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to come and write, but Sarah and I decided a fight was more important.&nbsp; She drank a lot (for my comfort, especially), but remained kind and respectful throughout the evening.&nbsp; She asked me to dance one time and I said no and she asked why... was it because we were gay?&nbsp; and I answered a fast yes.&nbsp; Apparently, she was  very  hurt by this, but chose not to say anything.&nbsp; Way later, I see her darkness and she won't discuss it in public, so I decided Party Over and came up to the room where she began telling me, venomously, that she hadn't ever seen that side of me before... the homophobe.&nbsp; I told her I was not being homophobic at all... I introduced her to everyone, held her hand, loved her, looked for her when she wasn't there, etc.&nbsp; I explained that she  loves  to squick the straights and uses me for her pleasure for it and I didn't want to do that at the reunion.&nbsp; She whined about how respectful she was, etc. and I told her how was I to know if she might not be in a place to squick the straights that second?&nbsp; I didn't have the game plan in front of me.&nbsp; After threatening to go home (which I didn't stop... she was acting like a child and I wasn't going to beg), she chilled enough to listen.&nbsp; We ended up in an okay place, but god, I hate alcohol.&nbsp; Stupid shit, that is.&nbsp; No one sober should have to deal with someone drunk. &nbsp; Yeah, had a dear friend say how sad it was I couldn't drink anymore because I was such a fun drunk.&nbsp; I blinked and walked away. &nbsp; Tonight is the dinner.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see how it goes.&nbsp; Wonder what short shorts is gonna wear.&nbsp; Everyone is wearing black, so that means I am wearing every color I can find.&nbsp;  laughing

      The plane landed... Teresa picked us up (she looks exactly the same as when we were in 4th grade... how does that happen?) and we took the stuff to the hotel and unpacked quickly.&nbsp; Sarah and I know our routine, that is for sure!&nbsp; Then we went to Dad and Pat's where we got some pics of the kids to show around&nbsp;and talked for awhile before heading to Sonny's BBQ.&nbsp; My fave!&nbsp; It thunderstormed and Sarah and I, childishly, stood outside and oo'd and ah'd over the lightning and thunder... god, how I miss that kind of rain and noise and light!&nbsp; The humidity is HEAVEN on my senses.&nbsp; I told Sarah that at PSI, my last 24 hours of life visualization included coming to Orlando and sitting with my immediate family and chosen family and being in Animal Kingdom and just eating, drinking, and talking.&nbsp; Part of that visualization is here today.  &nbsp;  I am here in Orlando for my 25th High School Reunion.&nbsp; How did I get so old?&nbsp; I remember my parent's 25th!&nbsp; Many of us re-found each other on Classmates.com (shameless plug that I don't get paid for) and, in fact, I have had about 5 other non-school friends find me via that website, too.&nbsp; Elizabeth comes today and Teresa and I are both nervous about it.&nbsp; Lisa is going to join us this early evening before the dinner, too... should be fun.&nbsp; Sarah was laughing because we speak about everyone with their first and last names and I keep having to erase them as I type them out here.  &nbsp;  I told Teresa she is gonna be so sick of vagina and boob talk after the weekend.&nbsp;  laughing &nbsp; Shari has had 9 kids... I am going to look at her formerly flat belly.&nbsp; So many of my classmates have chosen to not have kids at all... even the staunch Catholics... interesting.  &nbsp;  Sarah and I were supposed to go to Animal Kingdom tomorrow (today, Friday), but mom was weird about it, so we are just going to go to Teresa's and hang with her mom and go to the movies and mom said she would join us (how kind) at Pleasure Island's theater.&nbsp; Funny, as much as I always ALWAYS have to go to the Kingdom every trip (even as sick as I was in Dec!), I think it will be okay to not be there this time.&nbsp; Pleasure Island is a great consolation prize.&nbsp; Love that theater.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Donna has her surgery&nbsp; this morning.&nbsp; She was supposed to be having it in August, but a rush was put on it and it is this morning.&nbsp;  sigh &nbsp; That means I, her surgery doula, will be missing her surgery.&nbsp; I won't be there for Landen if he needs to nurse or to support Donna's DH as he waits the 2 hours of surgery.&nbsp; When we landed, Jacqui called me to tell me the news and I was devastated!&nbsp; Donna and I talked, however, about the last strings of preparation... including her borrowing my new  Hale  book on medications and nursing and bookmarking all the meds she has in case someone makes stupid comments about not being able to nurse.&nbsp; Sarah and I will send love and light to Donna, her DH, and Landen at 10:15am ET and have asked all we know to do the same.&nbsp; Pruning... that's all... just pruning the growth on the thyroid.&nbsp;  seeing it now   &nbsp;  More later... doing email and stuff.&nbsp; Sarah told me I could Net while here once we were here.&nbsp; I had prepared to just handwrite blog reports and type them up once home... but look!&nbsp; Unlimited access!&nbsp; Woo Hoo!

      To recall, PSI is People Synergistically Involved ( urlLink http://psiseminars.com/ )... an Empowerment series of seminars that has really, really great things to teach and share, but also had some hard-ass sales pitches interspersed and yeah, I know they gotta make money somewhere.  I took what I loved and left the rest.  Learned a LOT about my Self and my values and programs (childhood habits and beliefs), learned I was pretty darned psychic, and that I meditate well with colors.  Sarah and I are going to re-audit PSI Basic together in the next couple of months.  Already, our conversations have shifted since I get where she is coming from with her thoughts and such.  She has many, MANY years of PSI beliefs behind her... I am a newbie.   Reading notes from notebook   My initial notes were cynical because of the personal responsibility issues.  (Meghann and I made bruschetta last night and I am having some for breakfast as I write.  It is soooo good even though my throat is killing me.)  Completed exercises supposedly illuminated how we lived our lives... parallels we could see that proved we lived our lives in acquiescence, in cut-throat competition, in confusion or ignorance.  I disagree.  I believe that the exercises (which I will not post simply for those that go to PSI after me) can highlight  parts  of our lives... (speaking from ME)...  parts  of my life... but, the way I played the games was not  THE  way I live my life.  When someone tried to counter the Facilitator (Paul), they were blocked with "Resister" (I knew that term would appear!)... name calling never done, but "resistance" brought up time and time again.  I learned to jot notes instead of speak aloud.  I saw through how I played the games I can be a lemming in parts of my life.  That when there are difficulties (especially in science and math), I would rather play Barbie Dolls than figure out the puzzle pieces.  I see that I am not terribly competitive except with stories and writing.    "Feedback" was a word bantered about that really meant, "C'mere and lemme judge you, you dishrag," so I learned to not appreciate feedback so much.  There is something to be said about poking someone's frailties.  Annoying, in the least amount of pain... devastating in the most.  It's funny.  I have had so much therapy (and this was the concentrated orange juice of therapy, no matter what they said) that I have a tendency to protect my heart from that kind of expository feedback... I feel I am at overflowing level of pain much of the time anyway (psychic/emotional)... why would I want more?  PSI's belief, however, is if you LOOK at it... touch the programs and where they came from and toss what doesn't work, keep what does, the pain diminishes.  I wonder if that is so.  It was crappy to be told several times that I needed to "let go."  I cried some.  Some of the control was I didn't know these people and even though those crying/shouting exercises were in the dark with music on, I have cried my head off privately so much in the rest of my life!  I finally told my small group leader to stop telling me to let go!  I wish I had a dime for every time I told someone to stay in their own yard.  Yard Story:  If someone is standing out in their yard and walks over to their neighbor's fence and starts pointing out the neighbor's faults... Paint that trim!  Pull those weeds!  Mow that lawn!  By paying so much attention to the neighbor's house, the house they live in behind them becomes the house of neglect.  I have used this analogy for many years... the kids know it well.  Some of why I didn't cry was vanity and, sitting outside my Self and watching, it was an hysterical reason not to cry.  I brought make-up and went out and re-made-up during breaks after crying sessions!  Isn't that a scream?  When did I get so vain?  Sheesh.  During a screaming exercise, I had to lay down boundaries as I watched a demo of what we were to do.  I told the small group leader I had to have the people screaming (my programs) stay out of my face... that if I backed up, they could not move forward.  Didn't help that one of the guys who liked me lots was Latino (my dad) and had a harder time staying out of my face, but I got through.  There were other boundary issues, too.  During one time, we massaged each other's shoulders (Givers Gain!) and, I felt icky (I hate massages), so excused myself to go pee.  As I returned, they were tickling each other... I almost fainted.  Tickling is nearly violent to me and I was so thankful my instinct pulled me out of there to avoid that yuck.  Once, during a dancing time, I was sulky, so was sitting out.  During the dancing, a few guys began running around and tickling the others.  I moved to the back wall and pressed myself nearly flush into the paint.  I must have had a nice barrier (horrified face?), because they would just dance by me if they even came near.  Are those things resistance?  Is that me not wanting to change?  Or do those programs serve me well?  I believe that many of my programs serve me well.  Funny, those around me move around my quirks... is that wrong?  I feel like  I  am the one that is always allowing for others' needs and desires, but apparently, I am delusional.  "Feedback" said that I wanted to be right at all costs... that I was articulate and used research and therapy and life to justify my behaviors.  Confused, I wonder: is that wrong?

      So, all day, Meghann and Sarah made fun of me barfing SkittleJuice yesterday.  Meggie made me tell the mom's group who laughed til they nearly peed their panties (or spewed milk from their nipples)... but, Meghann's fave part is the part where she describes my throwing up.  I hate throwing up.  Hmmm... hated.  Pre-op.  Now, it isn't such a big deal, actually.  Because the pouch is so small, nothing sits in it... no bile, nothing.  (Isn't this the grossest blog talk ever?)    Meghann hadn't seen me throw up before yesterday at the doctor's when I was getting my cho-cha checked out to see if I had a delightful outbreak of herpes or ulcers from the Diflucan (aren't you glad you checked in today?).  Dunno the answer yet, tho' prolly herpes.    N E Way.  So, we get home from the Skittle-itis episode and Sarah and Meggie start chatting about my barfing style and how Meggie thought I sounded like a lion roaring!  I laughed as they continued about how Meghann expected miles of puke, but nothing more than a thimble-full came up (the SkittleJuice mimicking itself like blood).  Both those women I love... my Sarah and my Meggie... began imitating me gacking up a fur ball like a kitty and I just sat and watched... and giggled.  Sarah told several Barb Barf stories (eating a hard-boiled egg and then spewing it after taking a sip of water right as the cardiologist walked in - the big joke in the family:  How big is your pouch?  The size of a hard boiled egg... and not a sip more!) and Meghann continued her amazement at my throwing up and I shrugged and read In Touch magazine (love the trash, but not Enquirer kinda trash... I have my limits and all).  I remember one Hispanic woman who learned about my doula-ing at a baby shower and she begged me to doula for her even though she was near broke.  We talked about bartering... she was a seamstress, but not legal in the US.  No problem at all for me, I told her.  We talked several times.  She came to Ama Mama to meet me and we got along great!  She wanted to make me clothes or pay me in installments and that was cool.  She invited me to her home to meet her man (not hubby) and I went about 3 weeks later.  Her man happened to be a Border Patrol Agent.  Interesting, the illegal status of his chick, ya know?  But, who am I to care.  The queer part of this story (literally and figuritively) is that I could see his fear and disgust when he heard about Sarah being in law enforcement.  Well, the law enforcement thingie wasn't the issue, I am sure... the dyke thing, however, was.  I never heard from her again.  I wonder what he told her to keep her from me.  She had wept in my office about finding me a kindred spirit... how glad she was that she found someone to be with her that was a woman while she labored.  I wonder how her birth went.  I wonder how her heart is in that relationship.  I don't have clue one what brought her to mind tonight, either.  Gotta write about PSI... gotta gotta.

      When one has a gastric bypass, the worst thing in the world that can happen is an ulcer in the pouch.  The pouch is the size of an egg, so any hole in there can be devastating.  More surgery, blood transfusions, incredible limitations to food intake are all a part of the difficulties of ulcers after Weight Loss Surgery (WLS).  So, when I began throwing up blood, you can imagine my concern.  During PSI (an entry all on its own) on Sunday, I threw up twice and there was blood, but I had tomatoes on the sandwich and thought that might be it... kinda noted it, but pushed it aside.  However, during the herpes check at the doc's yesterday and I felt so horrible (faint, weak) and after the NP left and I vomited blood again... I became more alarmed.  Meghann helped me find a bathroom so I could diarrhea and vomit at the same time (I thought I was going to faint) and I was just terrified about the blood.  I called Dr. Kallen before I even left the hospital.  I ran through the multitude of meds I was on trying to see if any were NSAID in origin or had that inclination to pierce a pouch... nothing that I could think of.  Dr. Kallen didn't call back in a timely enough manner, so I called back and they put me right through.  He told me to get to the ER now.  Asked what my pulse was... 110.  Go NOW.  Take an ambulance if I am alone.  I told him I wasn't, that Meghann could take me.  He said go NOW.  I called Sarah, on cop duty, and she raced home, threw her armor off, a shirt on, and we were out the door toot sweet.  During the waiting time for Dr. Kallen, I collected, in 2 separate Gladware thingies, my vomit with blood and my diarrhea to check for occult blood.  Meggie was disgusted and made aluminum foil covers for them so she didn't have to see the specimens.  I laughed while I nearly fainted covering the plastic.  I get to the ER... they whisk me in... ask a hundred questions... and then Sarah and I were in a cubicle thingie and I am gowned nekkid and gurney-ized.  The kind nurse comes in, tries to poke me for blood work and an IV and misses.  I tell her no more pokes until she tests the samples for blood.  She thought that was a great idea.    During the time apart, when Sarah and I weren't fighting over PSI concepts or silent because I was done fighting, Sarah went through my diet for the day.  I ate au gratin potatoes at 6am... that was it!  I felt horrible... zero desire to eat all day.  She asked, "no candy, no crackers, nothing else?" and my face dropped.  I'd had TWO Skittles at the doc's office... but I couldn't remember what color they were!  We started laughing about the absurdity of my vomiting Skittle-color, not blood... that the day before had probably, in fact, been tomatoes.  Sarah played the What-If game about why I had a fever, why was I faint, why blah blah blah and I told her I was NOT being scoped if I didn't have blood in that vomit she was checking.    When the nurse came in, we told her about the Skittle episode and she laughed her head off... went to the other nurses and  they  laughed their heads off... we were all giggling so much; the comic relief was welcome.  The nurse came back awhile later... no blood.  No pokes.  I wanna go.  She said I would have to sign AMA if I didn't wait for the doc, but she would send him in right away so we could go.  I was soooooooo embarrassed, but couldn't stop giggling.  Meggie tried to give me granola when I felt faint!  I chose the stupid Skittles.  The doc came in, asked his requisite questions, laughed and sent us on our way.  All I had was Skittle-itis... didn't even need a Skittle-ectomy or anything.

      So, I very reluctantly went to the PSI Seminar last night.  They gave us 2 hours to decide if we wanted to stay or go.  I spoke up that I was nearly forced to go... stated that PSI was Sarah's family's religion and that I had already had 25 years of therapy and didn't know why they wanted me to go so badly.  (I was interrupted... oh, pardon, the Facilitator "interjected"... that this is NOT a religion nor therapy... yet, there were off and on jokes about, "Don't drink the kool-aid."  Funny?  Not to me.)  It felt good to speak up about my anger at the feeing of being coerced into going.  (And I knew damn well better than to SAY that because the entire seminar is based on personal responsibility... and I DO know that I could have said no, but I also want to please my mate.  Right or wrong.   laughing at the right or wrong's coming up )  I feel that Sarah's family is expecting an amazing transformation into someone who will get with the (*insert family last name here*)'s Program and automatically come back to BBQs and family events, happy and Stepford-ized.  Ain't gwanna happen.    2 hours came and went and they asked who wanted to stay and all but 5 were staying and those 5 left with sour faces.  I chose to stay.  So, their motto/mantra is  To Think Is To Create .  And for a LONG LONG time, I heard this from Sarah and believed its reality and truth.  And then, when I stepped out of my depression and my house and my sheltered (sorta) life, I began watching as women of privilege worked very very hard to create their Perfect Births.  Hypnobirthing classes, childbirth classes, reading all the "right" books, hiring a doula, a midwife, planning their elaborate home waterbirths... and then they had horrendous labors, transports, ending up, 2 in particular, not only with cesareans, but with cesareans with general anesthesia!  What is up with that?  Or the UC women we know who work so hard to birth their wondrous babes only to have them die.  Or our hospital mums... and their amazing work to create the birth they need and want on their path... and they are given birthrape instead.  What of that?  What of children who are molested?  Folks who are raped?  If all thoughts manifest into reality, who the fuck is thinking up these thoughts at 6 months (or 6 years or 16 years) old?  Is this cynical?  Or real?  I can't wait to explore it more the next 3 days, 'cuz if no one else brings it up, I sure am.  Now, I  will  agree that there are no accidents in the choreography of our lives (my words, finding more poetry than they used).  The rapes and incest and neglect and watching a drugged mom and all that I lived through have helped make me who I am.  Crappy childhood and early adulthood, sure, but I wouldn't have gotten into therapy and found new ways to mother (not only my Self, but my children, too!), new ways to cope (besides killing my Self), new ways to handle difficulties in relationships, etc.  Does it mean I am glad I had those things happen?  Hell, no!  Does it mean I Own the experience?  Absolutely.  By taking them and making them mine, I take the shitheads' power from them and become stronger as they get weaker.  (My incestuous step-grandfather killed himself about 4 years ago... thank the Goddess!  Ding dong, the Witch is dead!)  I have written notes as I listen... and I laughed as I was writing and could "hear" the teacher/facilitator answer as I begin asking questions (I haven't yet, but it's coming)... I can HEAR them... "Let's look at your resistance.  Why do you think you are resistanting thus and so?"  I swear to you... I will come home tonight with this example.  They, over and over, say:  No right or wrong... there is no right or wrong answer... but, in reality, there ARE!  Even in this class thingie.  An example I shared with Meggie today (not a real example of what he said):  So, what is your favorite fruit?  Bananas?  Or blueberries?  No answer is right or wrong... *someone raising hand*  *pointing to person*  Yes?  "Blueberries."  HUGE singing voice, YESSSS!!!!  exactly!  *another hand*  *pointing to person*  Yes?  "Bananas."  Well, sure, yeah... that can be a favorite fruit.  (Do you hear me snickering over here?)  I think sometimes I have had far too much therapy for "new" ideas like this.  I was angry when I got there.  Felt more relaxed later and am looking forward to it tonight.  I threw the chip off my shoulder during the evening (they  got  me during the part about Service and how important Service is to this organization... inbetween selling the videos, cds, blah blah) and decided I would use the opportunity to tighten up my therapy and communication skills.  I have slept all of 4 hours total, however, so shall be TIRED tonight!  Note to Self:  Discuss Quandrants next post

      So many loving thoughts and words have come through my Empowered list and my private email... so many women abused and raped who are pulling me into their hearts and trust. I feel so blessed (and the word "unworthy" jumped to my fingers, but I will squelch that one)! Much work to do and Kimba had amazing points that were in my fingers earlier today as I was driving to the prenatal I had to do... that when I joined the Empowered list, the reception I received was chilly and, in some instances, downright angry and my email was nasty! Until recently, I got nasty emails. It's funny, I was going through old posts I wrote (I keep all posts that have anything I feel might be substantial later) and found one from Ocean (Kimba) to me... right after I joined and she was so patient and so kind... yet, direct. Very, very interesting that it is obvious I hadn't been around long... the word "midwife" stinking up the room like an old lady's perfume long before I got myself seen and heard. I was going to ask if I could re-post it; might later. Now that I have been around... share what I know (no secrets here!)... and offer information and support to whomever asks, things are more calm... easygoing.   But, I wonder what Donna's birth would have been like if I had had to  do  something. What if the baby needed resuscitation? Mom needed pitocin? What if she had asked for a vaginal exam? What if we had had to transport? Would it still have been considered a Perfect Birth? Or is only a midwife-observed birth or UC a perfect birth. What about a UC that ends in tragedy? Or a birth where the midwife starts an IV during labor because the mom hemorrhaged and transported last time and she is trying to avoid that happening again (an open line for IV pit which hits the system immediately as opposed to IM pit that takes 3-5 min to take effect).   What  is  the Perfect Birth and who defines that?   I remember this one couple... I had only just had my second kid (UC) and had been to maybe 2 other births... starry-eyed and HIGH with hearing birth stories. I listened as they told their story of laboring quietly in the livingroom in front of the fire... no one speaking, hearing the crackling of the logs... music playing softly in the other room... mom squatting for the birth... baby comes out, no tear, breathes right away... nurses right away... midwives clean up and leave. The woman/mother telling the story doesn't feel my jealousy... green with envy because my UC was so chaotic when Meggie couldn't come out and we called EMS (no 911 back then). But, I sat with eyes glistening in my place of wishful thinking and then she says after a pause, "But I wish we had blah blah blah instead." And I can't even remember WHAT she wanted instead (different music, different food afterwards, different choice for birth position... something like that), but the impact of the desire for alteration to what sounded to me like The Perfect Birth was amazing! I heard women, over the years, have similar wishes and grew to acknowledge that there is almost always  something  we would change about our births if we could. It seems to help some women who feel guilty about not making the "right" choice the first time (or 7th time) around.   In our society, however, women have fewer babies and the healing that we can accomplish through birthing might not be done via our wombs or vaginas, but perhaps our words... our acknowledgement of what occurred... maybe that is another path to the healing that women need to do. (Or any number of other vehicles... I am not wanting to seem arrogant that writing is THE way... art, dance, music, drumming, boxing, biking... endless options.) What do we do with the mom who had every semblence of the Birth From Hell and it is her ONLY birth experience she will ever have? I have at least 2 women in my life right now that that is the case and, besides therapy and listening to endless tales of their stories (one of which I attended, but was a near-observer), I don't know what else to do. Do I take them out to the desert and have them shoot targets? Do they stab sheets on the clothesline? Do they do as I did once and throw bread dough at the walls for 2 hours? Make confetti by tearing up 4 reams of paper 2 sheets at a time and leaving it around to kick for 3 weeks?   This discussion brightens my hope for my Self. I felt so disgusted with who I was and what I had done and now, I can honor those women's spirits and souls and thank them... just as I thank my firstborn (Tristan)  every  time I talk to him... for letting me learn on them... Be-ing my stepping stones (spiritually, literally) to where I could DO Donna's birth.   What if I had never found the Empowered list? What if Donna hadn't liked what I had to say those first couple of posts? What if Donna and I hadn't met 15 years ago at a pool party? What if I didn't live here? What if I hadn't attended Donna's transforming birth? Where would I be?   Surely not here.   As I bless and thank the women I pained... I thank the women whom I haven't pained, yet have transformed me, nevertheless.   I love you all.

      I knew that doing something for someone else was the answer to the pain I feel at what I have done to women as someone learning midwifery... and one of the wonderful midwives on one of my lists stated this as an idea, too.  She suggested a letter and I might do that... burning it... praying/sending love and apologies to the women... that might be the beginning at least.  I can never go back to that place... where I was learning... where so much evil happened.  It swirls around my head and makes me dizzy.  I love the daylight and am saddened by its waning already.  I can feel December's darkness over my shoulder.  We must invest in full-spectrum lights for the (home) office this year.  I need light.  Long, long day ahead.

      I have read so much on my Empowered list... so much pain. This writing shares thoughts about the accumulation of thoughts from the past few days... and adds more thoughts to what I wrote earlier tonight.   And, then I also need to add that a violated friend wrote me the most kind words about why she would want me as her midwife with her as she birthed (even after she read the post I wrote below this one)... because I knew... I know the Truth. That meant more to me than anything.   What I wrote:   I could die I am so saddened by what I read. My heart aches for the vile and despicable acts you women... too many women... have experienced. Forgive as I speak to post after post and don't attribute the original poster... I just need to talk.   There is no violation worse than another's. Absolutely. In incest survivor groups, it was always a case of Hers Is Worse Than Mine because  all  of us minimized. Even the women who were ritually mutilated thought the others had it better.   A bizarre aside: I left Christianity after a life of United Methodist and Born-Again Christianity for 2 reasons. 1. Because a youth counselor told me that men were allowed to masturbate, but women were not because men had needs... women were closer to God and could control those urges. and 2. Because, in Incest Survivor's Anonymous, we read the Lord's Prayer and I was NEVER going to speak to "Our Father Who Art in Heaven" who raped me ever again. Such a weirdo where my mind bends.   I'm sorta Jewish now.   Anyway, I had to go vomit twice at work today. There were no words to write as my office manager left work early to tend to her sick husband and today was friggin' busy. Vomiting was better at the moment. Writing is now, but I am still nauseous.   I keep seeing the pictures shared. The violations. The rapes. Yes, the absolute and concrete rapes that were committed on our precious women (YOU precious women). I am so repulsed by the stories. I am incredibly saddened by the realization of others as they use new words for their disgusting birth stories.   My own hospital birth pales in comparison (ooo, minimizing?) even though the unnecessary episiotomy I had (mediolateral) went deep into my thigh muscle and I could not sit flat on my bottom for well over 6 weeks and had green pus oozing out of me. Even as I couldn't shit for 5 days postpartum and when I did with an enema and near  hysterical screaming, I tore my colon inside that would tear with each birthing head I passed through my vagina and require surgery years later.   And I sit here thinking about my role in birth as a care giver... and it sucks. I can't even begin to describe my own inner horrors of what I have done to women. I have written about them. I have my Self and my own inner journey to process all that I find I am as this discussion unfolds. (I am sorry I sound so angry. I am VERY angry at my Self and my history as a midwife, doula, student.)   I carefully weigh what I share. Knowing that many will write and demand my unsubbing... that unsubs might come of my own disclosure...  because  I am a Discloser... airing my own dirty laundry.   I know that my impulse to unsub came from my own feelings of Being the Enemy most here despise (even if I couldn't verbalize it at first). I am still compelled to unsub, but will work through the urge as I have been asked to by one of the violated who has read my  story already. I will do my best to find a place of peace.   Somehow, I need a way to thank and apologize to the women I hurt along my path. I am pondering what exactly to do.   *crawling along, not feeling so evolved tonight*   BarbH

      I am going crazy.  How did this topic come up now?  I am getting ready to spend 4 intense days at PSI (People Synergistically Involved -  urlLink http://psiseminars.com  ), just started new psych meds, am in the healing moments of a cocci episode, and now birthrape?  Sheesh.  What makes my soul think it is ready for this?  All day, there were moments of elusive clarity.  Meghann is so attuned to my lack of reality, she just laughs.  My heart aches that I think I am dying of insanity like my mother.    My mind cannot stop the thinking about the birthrape issue and NO ONE in my life, not even Sarah, wants to hear one thing about it.  Connie said she would talk and we could process, but she is a client, albeit my hypno-therapist, but I have horrid feelings of guilt I have begun exploring about HER birth.  She has told me she loved her birth, even when I sobbed speaking about how I  hated  what I did to her at her birth (retrospectively; after Donna's birth).  It doesn't make my heart rest any easier... well, maybe a little.  I can't stop diarrhea-ing.    I think the insanity and birthrape guilt are separate and together.  Maybe I am paying for my past now instead of later.  Just dig in.  As I learned to be a midwife, I did horrible things to women in the name of education.  I have held women's legs open ("to get the baby out"). I have pulled placentas out ("to learn how to get one out that needs help or if the mom is bleeding").  I have squished a woman's belly until I could nearly feel her spine, which is, actually, the wording used by the teachers (plural):  Push until you find her spine ("to keep her from hemorrhaging and expel clots").  I have pulled placentas until cords have fallen off.  I have grabbed women's nipples and shoved them into their babies' mouths.  I have done vaginal exams on women who were screaming NO!  I have coerced women to allow me into their vaginas for exams.  I have done "finger forceps" [a misnomer] (using my fingers to press the ischial spines open wider for a baby to come through faster).  I have ruptured membranes because I needed to learn how.  I have manually dilated cervices that did not need to be touched because I needed (or thought I needed) to learn how to do it in an emergency.  I have manually dilated a cervix on a woman having a waterbirth (and I wasn't wearing gloves) and got her cervical flesh under my fingernails.  As a doula and student, I stood by and watched as women screamed to be left alone.  I  watched midwives with 3 inch fingernails shove cervices from 3-10 in a few minutes.  I watched as women had cytotec inserted into their vaginas secretly.  I watched as women unknowingly drank cytotec from Gatorade bottles.  I witnessed pitocin being secretly injected into the vaginal vault to projectile a baby in second stage arrest.  I witnessed pitocin being put on gauze and put in women's vaginas without their knowledge.  I watched as the gauze was put in their rectums without their knowledge.  I have seen women sutured who might not otherwise need it simply because someone needed training.  I have seen OBs cut an episiotomy because they are in a hurry.  I have heard evil things coming from OB's mouths towards clients and stood by and said nothing.  I have heard even more evil things come from midwives and stood by and said nothing.  I have seen and heard women be screamed at to shut up, grow up, that she asked for it by opening her legs 9 months ago, that she gets what she deserves.  I have seen a woman slapped by a midwife.  I have seen a midwife, on more than one occasion, hang a baby upside down and slap the baby up and down the back to revive him/her.  I have seen, on more than one occasion, midwives take a fainted woman's nipples and twist them nearly off to revive the woman.  I have seen many illegal maneuvers that have saved women trips to the hospital and have learned amazing amounts of information that I would never use unless a woman or baby were dying in my arms.  I have NOT done other equally unethical acts... have not ever cut an episiotomy because I needed to practice... have not sutured because I needed to practice... have not ever used forceps or vacuum extractor.  I have learned how to birth a baby in the caul.  I have learned how to sit and wait from long second and third stages.  But it doesn't remove one iota of the pain I feel.  There is no catharsis.   I am the enemy that the women on the Empowered list speak of.  I am their pain.  I embody it.  I created it.  I am more filled with shame than there are words to describe.    Does it make any difference that I have grown to not do these things?  Did I have to walk that path to get where I am?  Why did I love the learning I experienced?  Why did I get high from all the energy and the uncertainty?  Do I  really  believe I wouldn't be the midwife I am today if I didn't know all I know?  Am I better able to speak the language of the enemy because I  am  the enemy?  Do I have any right speaking to the women whose hearts bleed and whose bodies are mutilated?  I pray to find the balance of peace and forgiveness... all within my Self. urlLink

      I like to think of myself as political.  I like to think I am informed... even savvy.  I am delusional!  This movie was like removing a veil of ignorance from my eyes.  Sure, Michael Moore is a tad sarcastic and emphatic, but I had NO idea so much crap was going on in our world.  It was like string art, matching the players... Bush and the bin Laden family... oil and greed... fumbling and golfing... I was nauseous during much of the movie... MADE myself look at the dead and injured people   WE   are killing in Iraq... and for what?!  OIL.  Oil.  Oil.  Money and oil and Bush's family.    I hang my head in shame.  I want to apologize to those mothers and fathers and children in Iraq.  I want to vomit and cry all at the same time.  I feel American soil deserves whatever Iraq gives us, yet, the reality is, the war in Iraq is probably what is keeping us from experiencing any additional terrorist activity... the heat being off the bin Laden family and all.  Thanks, president Bush (lower-case purposeful).  We are going to go watch fireworks at a friends' condo downtown... they invited us with many of their friends.  Meggie and I will go together, Sarah's mom is driving Sarah there.  We need to be there at 8pm.  Should be interesting, at least.  Glad I saw 9/11 today!  Something to yack about with rich folks.  Nothing from Aimee today.  I miss her.  A friend from my Empowered list wrote something loving about psychically holding her and how she chose me to be with in this life since I would understand more than another mother... made me feel lots and lots better.  More later.

      I have thought muchly today about being able to write here.  Sarah and I talked about it for a few minutes and I think she wants to read my blog, too.  Nice, I think.  I write so much about things she and I don't have time to discuss, it would be good.   Now that the titers are down and I am feeling better physically, I am wanting again.  We are going to try for a "date" tomorrow before she goes to her sister's house (I ain't goin').  Found some stuff at the pharmacy called Nose Better for my nose... already, it feels SO much better.  Pat (step-mom) told me about it for CPAP users.  Much appreciated.  I keep trying to get one of my pics up, but the url's are too long, so I need to get another page up on the website so I can add my pic to the blog... too generic, otherwise.  These new meds are great for dieting.  I hardly ever think about food.  Hope the sensations last.  Meggie made dinner, I vacuumed, and talked to Aimee as she was on her way to a Rave.  She said she is still looking for a place to live.  I bit my tongue that she had a place to live... here.  She wouldn't have liked that.  She said she was reading my emails, so that's good.  Sarah came home for dinner which was nice.  Meggie and I watched Ellen's stand-up dvd and laughed lots (Sarah and I laughed last night at 4am).  Midwifery Today is interested in Donna's Birth Story that I wrote (the baby is 4 weeks old today!), so I did some prelim editing for them (tried to get some of the ellipsis-es out of there) and we'll see what else they cut out/edit away.  I was glad they liked it, though.  Not your typical homebirth story from a midwife.  I feel so old listening to 70's hits and knowing more of those words than the songs' words from today.  What does that?  I'm tired, but am sure I will be back in a few hours for more.  I am stoked!

      I wrote this this morning on my Empowered list and thought it appropriate here, too.  > Time, time, time.  From the moment we have our babies we raise them  > to leave us..... if they leave home happily we wonder what they cant  > wait to escape from, if they leave home angry and defiant - we wonder  > what they cant wait to escape to..... yet they pretty much all come  > back!  If I were sitting and talking to someone in my shoes, it would be easy to explain.  Sitting here, and intellectually knowing what you say is true, doesn't appease the logical or the emotional part of me at all.  Your words are 100% correct and I know, but I am filled with those "Why's" and "How's."  How do three kids come from my uterus and 2 people's DNA turn out so dramatically different?  How did nursing the girls the exact same amount of time, co-sleeping, baby-wearing, attachment parenting, non-violent discipline/guidance, eating the same food, having the same parents... how do 2 girls turn out so differently?!?  Aimee (18), a rebel with green hair and body piercings (more now, I am sure)... supremely bright, but not having the inclination to DO anything with it... sometimes lazy and often smirky.  Meghann (20), never a rebellious day in her life, 4.0 in college that she is speeding through, skipping years, volunteers with emotionally and physically challenged kids, in band, in her sorority, working for peanuts with her mother over the summer with an attitude of joy and delight.  What happened?!?  Their births were really nice (Meggie's, by far, the more dramatic with a shoulder dystocia, etc.), each of them tandem nursed for awhile... I just don't get it.  I don't like when my Human Nature side comes out and wants THE ANSWER.  Not just *an* answer, but THE answer.  Very frustrating.  My son Tristan (21), I can blame his hospital, drugged birth on... not nursing long enough, allergies to everything because I smoked during the pregnancy and fed him food at 4 months old... all my fault.  Mea Culpa.  But the girls... what is UP with that?  Meghann sits with me listening to her sister and just does NOT get how she is so blind to the real world.  Did I not tell her enough of our homeless stories (my own and the ones with the kids)?  Did she not understand that people who do drugs are thieves and backstabbers?  (We suspect her friends are doing Crystal Meth and Ecstacy and more... and her?  I prefer to believe she isn't, but worry, nevertheless.)  I wonder if ANYTHING I did as a mom with these kids made any impact at all.  I listen to new moms wringing their hands about whether their baby should have a bath every day or every other day and want to scream, "WHAT THE F*&^ DOES IT MATTER?!?"  Did it matter that I was molested, smacked around, grew up in a drug-addicted, profoundly depressed household and still came out a loving compassionate human being?  Did my AP parenting cripple my children somehow?  Did my AP parenting cripple Aimee?  Should I have smacked her?  (That is a totally absurd thought on many levels... just having thoughts flowing through my fingers.  She was the easiest of all the kids!  Always below the radar... always smiling and easy-going... until hormones.)  She inherited my depression.  Tristan has some, but Aimee has it much more similar to me.  She has the benefit of having an aware mom who got her help, but, as I did before I knew about help, she finds self-medication (recreational drugs and anger) more appealing.  And again I ask... did anything I do as a mom with these kids make an impact?  Or is it all hormonal and the luck of the draw?  I suppose I might know when or if they have their own children, eh?  I just worry about Aimee's life with people who don't love her as I do... who won't tend to her gentle spirit the way I do.  How can she run so easily from my breast and enveloping arms?  How did my mother live when I did the exact same thing at 18?  Oh yeah, she was drugged and didn't care.  Believe me, the desire is there (emotional memory?) to drug-out and let go of the pain, but I feel it is my duty... my MamaPlace... to hold her psychically within my embrace, protecting her from the wolves of the world.    *sighing*  Thanks for listening.

      ... and it is so scary sometimes.  My titers came back today and they were down for the first time in at least 4 months!  Hurray!  The doc lowered the Diflucan to 600mg a day instead of 800mg, which is good since my hair has begun falling out in clumps and the ulcers are now in  all  of my mucous membranes.  *sigh*  I woke up with night sweats, but I know that happens when I lower the meds, so, I'll live with it.  I have stopped the sleepy-time pills (terrified of addiction, despite what the Psych says) and am now awake in the middle of the night after a mere 3 hours' sleep.  Oh, well.  I am on so many meds, the fewer I ingest the better, in my book, even if I am awake in the middle of the night sometimes.  No word from Aimee today.  She left a curt note in my email that she had her meds, but nothing since despite my writing her loving notes and asking for word.  I miss her so much.  Sarah cleaned her room (Aimee's) and packed her things for her so Meghann had a place to live while here this summer... it looks weird not seeing stuff all over the floor.  I hope Aimee isn't crushed that we cleaned her room so quickly, but it was necessary for Meggie's comfort and privacy.  It just feels weird, not having sulky Aimee around... some relief, much sadness... and weird.  More later.

      We're here.  We're tired.  Mostly, we are cranky.  Sarah is the least fun sometimes on these jaunts, though she is making a concerted effort to be patient and kind despite having to drive 15 of the 22 hours... the last 4 in a deluge with screaming thunder and lightning.  We went through Carlsbad and there were cars floating from the amount of rain pouring down!  Cars' headlights were covered.  I kept thanking the Universe for Sarah's big butch F-250.  And the wind was phenomenal!  I was so thankful she was driving.  We would have sat and slept if I'd have been alone or in charge.  I keep crying that I have to leave my Meggie here.  She tears up, too, but told me it was too early too cry.  We are almost done gathering her things from around Lubbock... gonna go eat at the  County Line BBQ  (El Paso has State Line, same thing... second best BBQ in the US except for Sonny's in Orlando.  The place I can never remember in Austin is 3rd.) and then we will get the rest of her stuff, Sarah will sleep and we will leave after she awakens.  We did stop for 30 min or so in El Paso at Casa... saw Dani, Larkie, and Melodia.  I kinda told Mel about my movement away from touchie births and she was fascinated.  She asked if I'd shared with Linda yet and I said no (Linda owns Casa), but that I would when ready... the words were still forming.  Mel is leaving at the end of the month to go homebirth midwife in the woods of Arkansas with her family (Quiverful family) and she can't wait to email with me about homebirth stuff vs. Casa stuff.   I am still confused about how I feel about Casa.   For me, I know I learned lifetimes of information, but can find my way out of the spiritual void that exists there.  Not everyone can. Would I send someone there to train?  Probably not with out me.  (Boy, does that make me sound arrogant!)  But, trying to think of how to empower women AND get massive training... it's a hard call.  I have often called the  Casa Experience   Midwifery Boot Camp ; I still believe it is so.  I am very drained.  Very tired.  Want to go home and don't want to leave all at once.  I have some work to do with Meital... sweet girl that she is.  She enthusiastically volunteered to go assist Sandra at a birth if I wasn't in town.  Sandra called and said she didn't know where to begin with why that just isn't possible.  I have to have a yickety-yack with her.  Jacqui is going to work this Wed and next Wed... that will help lots.  Apparently, there is even more to the story of the dis-invited midwife and I am being asked to meet with the one midwife and client regarding the client's distress.  Have to remember to ask Meital to not call clients "patients."  Ick.  I keep thinking of birth stories to write... work to do... yet am trying to Be Here Now with my Meggie.  She is pretty much done with us, I think.  She is so grown up.  More later or at home.

      Taking Meggie back to Lubbock in awhile.  Sarah is air-pressuring the tires, she still has to pack the stuff we have all over the bed and table into a container, get ice, and we are outta here.   We have enough food to last us a walking migration across the entire Great Plains.  Why do we think we need 3 boxes of different cookies, 2 huge bags of chips, 10 sandwiches each (I can eat a half at a time!), and 18 Diet Cokes?  Sheesh.  Getting there is 18 hours, but we are passing through (at the 12 hour mark) El Paso and we are stopping for lunch at Casa.  I have major mixed feelings, but do have friends there and want to say hi.  I promise not to molest any woman coming in to have a baby.  Today was a hard, hard day.  Meital will be the Receptionist when I come back.  Jacqui will be gone for 2 weeks and return a Colonic Therapist.  Meggie will be gone.  And I have to interview 80 hundred people for varying jobs all week... from acupuncturists to Marriage and Family Therapists to massage therapists.  I had a massage today.  Leetal, a friend of Meital's, and it was the BEST one I ever had.  I took the other therapist's stuff down and am begging Leetal to live at Ama Mama.  I HATE massages... weird, I know.  I hate hurting after them.  I have taken to asking to have lotion rubbed on me for an hour.  Leetal was very gentle even as she worked on hard areas.  I scheduled another for Monday at 4pm.  Figure after a million hours in the truck, I could use another.  My right ankle (where I had the RSD) is so swollen and car trips aggravate it delightfully.  Dunno what to do and can't find any ibuprofin (even though I am totally not supposed to take it).  Meggie made about 300 charts while she was here.  Please, God, let's get clients to fill the charts!  I am going to miss my girlfriend (Meghann).  She promises to email me and talk to me and play the Fill In The Blank game with me whenever I need to (that's the one where I can't remember what I want to say and she guesses until she gets it right).  Jacqui can play some, but now I have to find a psychic connection to Meital so she, too, can play.  Why can't I just type everything I need to say?  I am finally getting to writing my own kids' birth stories.  Dang, they are long!  Tristan's is 3/4 done and I won't get to finish it until I get back.   I love my Empowered list... freaking out the new people, I am sure.  Oh, well.  The old chickies know me and support me, even if they don't agree with me.  And I do the same with and for them!  More folks are reading this... welcome to my odd world.  I'm gonna shower and try to sleep some more even though I took 1.5 Provigil... hasn't kicked in yet (that's a med for narcolepsy, which I don't have, but am chronically exhausted).  Hope I can write during the weekend.  If not, I will catch up on Sunday!

      ... for my writings.  It feels SO good! It feels  so  good to write. It feels  so  good to be alive.  (Thanks to all y'all who write me!)  Steve Perry ( Journey ) is the best singer ever.  Blood is drawn and will be on its way to UC Davis (where I have my own shelf of blood and spinal fluid vials lined up like soldiers in a war we shouldn't be in) and I am visualizing Low Titers... low titers, Low Titers, LOW TITERS! I want less Diflucan. I want to be healed.  I want my hair back.  I want to stop being so tired.  I want life!  I got asked to assist at another birth (she is 37 weeks) because a midwife was dis-invited for being rude and presumptive at the prenatal (the assistant!). I am honored that I am being asked in my illegal state of affairs. (I am trying to be brave about why I am still illegal. Talked to the Attorney General today again and turned down the Medical Board's offer. I will re-apply for my license in January. We'll see what happens then. Believe me, it is a distinct consideration to not get licensed at all. But, being so public in my disobeying midwifery laws, I might be truly endangering my Self and the clients I would leave behind if I were in jail.)  Countdown to taking Meggie home: 40 hours   sigh

      ... and other songs that remind me of my youth.  (I love  Yahoo Launchcast Music ... way worth the few dollars a year.)  Meggie and I were invited to a Polo game Sunday by a friend from BNI. It was nice, but kinda boring after awhile. And I was a tad concerned that it was circus-like... you know, all oppressive to the horses and stuff. The horses were amazing, though, as they ran across the field. If there weren't smacking poles and stuff, it would have been okay, I think. My friend came and as she is 9 months pregnant, was the hit of the game. We talked some and then we had to go. Decent food (friend paid for it since we were guests)... dirty outside bleachers and chairs, though, and airplane toilets. How do those millionaires pee in airplane toilets? Did you know someone makes ads for Lear Jets and puts them in Polo programs? Sheesh. I live in another world.  My speech is frightening me. I am speaking to my Psych today and asking her what it is called when I can't find words in my mouth, but they pour out of my fingers just fine. 50 years ago, I would be thought mentally retarded. Thank god for the Internet!  I have gotten amazing feedback from my birth stories. I wrote out titles to several that need to be written... they are waiting for me to finish them.  I am tired.  I interviewed a chiro yesterday... loved her!  I interview others today... whom, I couldn't tell ya. Everyone rolls into one another. The chiro won't. She was yummy.  laughing   At the BNI meeting on Friday, Meghann sat inbetween the pregnant woman and I and she and I (the pregnant mom) couldn't shut up.  Meggie was eating her eggs and hash browns and this woman and I were talking about her mucous plug and wiping several times and was there blood or just snotty looking stuff.  I laughed and nudged Meg after a few minutes and said, "having fun?" and she laughed and said how far she has come since coming to work with me 6 weeks ago.  She used to get nauseous talking about vaginas... now she could practically see one on the table as she was eating and just keep chomping.  Considering she was the one I traumatized most as a child (about birth), I am glad we could begin again and she be fine about it all now.  I took an 8 year old Meghann to a birth at Alvarado with a migrant woman... a really nice birth (the woman met her at prenatals and invited Meggie)... and I didn't know it for a LONG time, but then and there, Meghann decided NO KIDS.  I felt  so  guilty for  so  long... that I had scared the grandchildren from my daughter.   Gradually, she has said she would adopt, but now, after this summer, she is more open.  And, of course, we have let Michael know, in no uncertain terms, that their baby is nursing forever, that the baby is co-sleeping (he was explosive about that and we all laughed and just let him know reality and Meg said, 'it's my baby, too!' I beamed with pride!)... Meghann has asked about everything from vaccinations to circumcision this summer.  I am so glad that, as an adult, I can calmly speak to her.  It will be the hugest lesson in my world if she chooses to do things differently than what I chose to do, but I am promising now to be gentle.  It was better speaking to her not on a 9-month time crunch.  Still time to brainwash.  Sarah and I are talking more.  She is acknowledging her need to shut up and listen.  She is reading a book called  The Game  and it is a motivational thing and it has her so hyped up I thought she was on speed the other day.  Poor Jacqui and her man... couldn't leave she wouldn't shut up on Sunday.  I tried to tell her gently to STOP IT and she is trying.  She said she is excited.  I told her I thought that was great, but when people have to sit for 90 min listening to her talk non-stop, it sounds like she is tweaking and that is scary coming from a cop.  We bought Meghann her washer and dryer... her bed from Mattress Discounters... her sheet set from Target... and we pack up tomorrow night and head out when Sarah gets off at midnight.  We are taking the computer (thank goodness!), but I will be reading to Sarah and Meghann.  I am packing a slew of cd's to play, too (Sarah has a  one  cd player thingie in her truck.  Egads... I feel like 6 isn't enough!).  We made a menu last night and Sarah laughed as we made it sound like it was a 5 day road trip.  Sarah hates McDonald's and roadside cafes, so she brings stuff and grills on the tailgate at rest areas.  Meghann and I think it will be adventurous.  I worry about being so tired.  In many ways I want to stay home and work.  But, in my life, I know I will regret it if I don't go.  Meghann has made it clear she needs me.  And I need to be there for her.  Tristan said he might go to Lubbock on the Sat we leave... Sarah said we could stay one more day if we needed, to, but Tris is so unreliable, we are just gonna go home as planned at 5am Sat am.  (George Michael's  Kissing a Fool  is playing now.  Sarah and I used to slow dance to this when the kids were hanging off our ankles.  I miss making love.)  Gonna write birth stuff for awhile.  Titers need to be drawn today.  Picking up the Trip Tik for real, too.  Then work, work, and more work.  I'm ready for a nap and it isn't even 6am!

      Linda from CAM and I have been yacking on the phone about all this CAM and Medical Board stuff and she has been helping me feel better about my bald head and rebirth stuff.  This morning, I had to call her to apologize for not sending the stuff from the Attorney General's office (this has yet to be blogged, btw), and that I had a prenatal I needed to do, but if she needed me, I was there to speakerphone with the Board.  It was early and I introduced myself as "The Bald Bitch" and launched into my explanation because I was kinda rushing to get out the door for the prenatal (with a Jamba Juice stop).  After I took a breath, the woman on the other end of the line said, "Do you know who you are talking to, Barbara?" and, thinking it was someone who just happened to pick up the phone at Linda's, said, "Who is it?"  Then the woman told me her name and it is a CLIENT of mine!  A client!  Client!  CLIENT!  A fantastically funny and loving client, but I was sooooooo embarrassed, I thought I was going to die laughing.  Meghann, watching it unfold from not on the phone, could barely breathe as she realized who it was I was talking to.  Of course, it was the client I was meeting in an hour to discuss her newly desired HBAC!   major red face   I was razzed at the prenatal and she said she would probably just have to call me the Bald Bitch from now on.  Oh my gosh.  The prenatal went well... I love yacking.  (isn't that shocking?)  We did no hands-on since she had just had a prenatal with the CNM at one of the friendlier hospitals.  We talked about what she wants out of a birth, who does what, what is a go and what isn't... stuff like that.  I will detail more after her birth (with her permission), but for now, know that it is going beautifully!  Meggie and I left there and went to IKEA to look for a bed for her and so she could get some odds and ends for her new house in Lubbock.  We leave Wednesday.   frown   We got to the bedding area and I plopped down on a chair and promptly fell asleep.  I felt my mouth hanging open more and more, but didn't have the energy to close it; heard total strangers saying, "Look at that lady" and walk away.  Meghann said that when she came to wake me up, people were staring at me and she waited until they walked away before acknowledging that she knew me.   kinda laughing   I awoke groggy and then Meggie checked out and we went to Cosco to look at mattresses, then to Mattress Discounters (where the mattress sets were from $600 - $5000!!! where is the discount?!).  Then home where I wrote and she slept.  My client asked me to write some more birth stories, so I will work on that tonight.  Going to Polo games tomorrow!  A doula client is getting us into the Polo games with lunch... should be fun.  I had to ask what to wear... dressy casual.  I will wear a skirt, but it's gonna be hot!  More later.

      ... really is rebirthing?  Linda up in Arcata (CAM Treasurer) was very, very helpful last night as we talked about the CAM Board of Director's meeting I am unable to attend this weekend because of feeling so icky.  She asked why I felt like I was going to die and I just said that it was something deep inside... besides the medication side effects, besides the overwhelming fatigue, besides the diagnosis... and she said that it might bear considering that I might actually be dying in a part of me only to be reborn again in some other part.  Epiphany!  In all my knowledge of rebirthing and recreating my Self (for heaven's sake, I have a tattoo on my breast that says:  I am a woman giving birth to myself!), this thought had not even occurred to me.  Aren't I the Navelgazer extraordinaire?   laughing   Apparently, some things are too close to see.  She did say, too, that if I am dying and I know it as my Truth, that that process needs to be honored, too.  I agreed.  But, I have a lighter heart today as I think of the impending death I feel, the incredible urgency to write and tell my stories, the sadness at losing this life before I have tasted every morsel, the pain at all the years I missed by being fat and depressed and angry... and I embrace those feelings... and am loving them... so that I might free them from my Self and my Psyche.  I want to live.  I  need  to live!  I have  so  much to do!  Thanks, Linda... you might have saved my sanity.

      On my Empowered list, there is a discussion about food... the introduction of it, the importance of it in our lives, how kids are fat, etc.  Reminded me of how it is to be fat in this culture.  I just had Meggie take a pic of me with make-up on and the bald head and there is a full body one and I immediately found myself judging it.  Look at those arms?  Sheesh.  Losing 200 pounds sure does do a number on the body.   urlLink http://www.picturetrail.com/gallery/view?p=999&amp;gid=4884447&uid=631889&amp;members=1   I can see my pannus under the skirt... I try to be proud of what isn't there, but it is tough sometimes.  I remember having my groceries pulled out of the cart and told I shouldn't be buying that.  I remember being pointed at and kids saying, "Mommy, that lady's having twins!"  I know for a fact that there was not one day of my life since I was 12 years old (unless I remained in the house) that I wasn't made fun of for my fat.  I used to try and walk for exercise, but was yelled at so much, I always quit.  I took to walking in the dark, but often felt unsafe.   I have had oranges thrown at me while walking.  I have had eggs thrown at me while walking.  I have had evil words thrown at me while walking.  Cow.  Pig.  Elephant.  Hippo.  People either said evil things to me or ignored me for over 30 years of my life.  I was mostly invisible even as I wore flashy clothes and was pretty gregarious.  Strangers couldn't tolerate my looks.  I was so fat I couldn't fit in underwear or bras and wore neither for over 10 years.  I had a yeast infection under my pannus and in my crotch and under my boobs for years.  While I still have to lift my pannus to wipe, I had to lift with 2 hands before the gastric bypass.  I couldn't wipe my own ass pre-op.  I couldn't fit in regular stalls pre-op.  I couldn't sit on most chairs and never in booths pre-op.  I still freak and judge spaces... always incorrectly now.  I never fit in turnstiles pre-op.  I hated shopping and would shop for food at 1am with the box openers at Von's.  I  never  ate in the store... something I do now without thinking; no one gives me a second glance now, but would have freaked on me before.  I was so fat I couldn't shop in regular fat lady stores.  I had to buy clothes from SuperSized stores in catalogues ( Making It Big  remains my favorite).  I remember when I was so hobbled by my size, a fat friend told me about  Birkenstocks  and they saved my life!  They were so expensive, but I could walk for 10 minutes in them without crying.  It is still all I wear and own about 10 pairs of them from sandals to Mary Janes.  I remember how much I was made fun of in school... called The Pacer for years.  It was a car in the 70's and the ads stated:  Has a wide rear-end!  And mine was  huge .   I had to have tables brought in when I was in college because I couldn't fit in the desks at all.  It was a disability ordeal each semester to make sure each class had a table for me and that no one else hogged it before I could get to class (I almost wrote "waddle."  Isn't that sad?).  I had no boyfriends for most of school... just too damn fat for 'em.  (Sarah loves Fat Chicks... something I work on now... how not to get fat[ter] again to please her!)  I used amphetamines at 10 years old (Black Beauties) prescribed by a doc to lose weight.  I have done speed, diets galore, ate Ayds diet candies like, uh, candy!  Did Weight Watchers more times than I can count, Overeaters Anonymous several times (I am not an Anon-kinda woman), did Phen-Fen so well I lost 111 pounds in 19 months and got permanent heart valve damage.  I have exercised, swam, walked, prayed, visualized, been deprived of money and a car, journaled, gotten therapy for 20 years, processed, dealt with childhood "issues," humiliated, cajoled, bribed, and convinced with medical evidence.  All to no avail.  Kinda speaks to the addiction/biochemical issues at play, wouldn't you say?  And I (sorta) laugh about having to lose 200 pounds to weigh 200 pounds.  While I am not as fat as I was, I am, in the words of Sarah... Garden Variety Fat.  No one stares at me anymore at all.  And that is weird.

      So, Sarah actually came and sat with me and talked to me and listened to me bitch about work and stuff... and about her not being near and she was very gentle and told me that since Meggie got here, I have been the one to be far, not her.  She, over and over, said it wasn't bad at all, my having this stolen, precious time with Meghann, but that my perception of her (Sarah) being far, was her reality about me; that I was VERY far.  And she is right.   Meggie is a girlfriend.  We laugh and things are easy and I have unlimited access to her.  Girlfriends like Donna or Gerri... everyone has kids or work or another life... and it is hard to fit movies or sitting on the couch watching E! Television or shopping... and with Meggie, I have had all of that.  She and I share a history... and we laugh about it all (or I cry and she tells me "it's okay, mom").  I feel out of place with most people.  With Meghann, I fit in... even in my crazed state.  She just takes it as a matter of course... takes ME as a matter of course.  Sarah listened as I told her how I needed help at work, my ideas about developing a Walk-In program, how we need practitioners that will be at the office to develop a walk-in program! How we can do staggered colonics with 2 machines and the one dedicated bathroom.  Sarah said she would sit down and look at her schedule and find time to be at Ama Mama every week to mop and dust and do those things I haven't had time for because I am working so hard on interviewing and hiring people that might actually stick around.  I know my interview style isn't the best lately because I am so cynical about people's motives and actions being diametrically opposed, but oh well.  I have to be honest if I am going to have people stay.  Sarah and I found a place of peace and made a date to be with each other when we get back from Lubbock.  She said she was lonely, too, and that she couldn't be that girlfriend I need.  I have complained about not having a girlfriend for years and years and I am cramming all my girlfriend time in Meggie's 6 weeks stint here.  I see her time gone looming and it breaks my heart!  Sarah just isn't the girlie girl I need in a girlfriend.  But she is a wonderful provider and lover and friend.  And so efficient.   I'm glad we talked and glad I was open enough to listen (not my forte).

      I am Overflowing with:   Sadness  - Aimee was here and picked up some boxes... I made her visit with me while I did her laundry.  It was okay, but I think she is on something... she couldn't stop jiggling.  It was wonderful to see her... sad she is still with that man/boy, but he is teaching her to drive, which is good.  She got a PT job at Fed Ex.  I'm glad.  They might be evicted from their apartment they have been in for less than a week for loud music that she swears was soft.   sigh    Sadness  - Meggie leaves in less than a week.  Who am I going to laugh with?  Sarah is so busy I am barely a thought in her life (although she counters me about this constantly).   Anger and Sadness  - The California Medical Board will not compromise on the stipulations on my "probation" for getting a license.  This is a long story worthy of a blogspot all its own, but know that I won't even qualify to try for a license again until January... and even then, they could slap the stipulations on me.    Amusement  - The CA Medical Board made their decision and I cried my head off after talking to the Attorney General and then I decided I would take no more clients on.  I was supposed to do two consults within the next hour and cancelled them, allowing another midwife to be the only choice.  Both consults showed up at the same time, so I showed one around the office and then sat and talked with her about homebirth and within 20 minutes, she asked me to be her midwife.  I explained about the no license thing and she laughed and said she couldn't care less.  So, despite the shit from the CMB, I have a new client due Christmas Day.  Gerri said she would do the birth with me.   sticking tongue out to CMB      Worry  - I talked to Dr. Kallen today and he is distressed I blew off the CT Scan and asked that I r/s asap.  It is scheduled for later this month.  Sarah said she would go with me since I need medication (severe reaction to the iodine contrast).  While I like my bald head, it is also a reminder of what I feel inside.  Maybe that is why I did it?   Frustration  - Women all around me... mother's group and on-line groups are making odd choices that bug me.  I try hard to Stay in My Own Yard, but I don't think I do well at that.   sigh   I should vent more here  instead.  Anyway, why someone would give formula AT ALL is beyond me.  Especially someone supposedly enlightened.   shaking head in confusion   Anyway.   Delight  - Piper came and told me she wanted to be a midwife and she was asking me to help her!  We cleared up a major confusion about her birth.  I had been dis-invited by the other two midwives for saying I could see her posterior baby without feeling her belly and Piper was a tad uncomfortable with that, but she  NEVER  asked me not to come to her birth and said she missed me there!  I was  very  upset that I had been lied to.  I told her I would not say anything to the other midwives because the issue was between us and they would have to contend with their own lies and that she and I had cleared the air and how fantastic was that!  I pulled out  Heart   and Hands  and  Henci Goer  for her to read.  I am thrilled she wants me to help her.   smile      Busy-ness  - I, literally, have a 6 inch stack of work beside me and all I want to do is blog and write and process the birthrape stuff.  I don't have time to hire practitioners!  I have about 8 massage therapist applications I need to respond to, need a new chiropractor (will post on Craigslist for that... that sucker is productive!), the new chick began training yesterday (Meital... pronounced "May-tall") and I think she will be good, but she doesn't know lots about the modalities.  I am leaving Jacqui to train mostly so will work from home until Monday.  I do have prenatals all day tomorrow at Gerri's and we are also meeting with Tonya Jamois about the conference.  I have a million things to do with that, too.  I will be speaker-phoned with the CAM BOD meeting this weekend so they have a quarum and will talk to them about the Conference and the shit from the CMB with me.  I have advertising to do galore.  I am doing laundry.  I have three charts to work on (brought them home).   Anticipation  - I want to   write   Write   WRITE   in the Birth Blog... I love sharing my stories and was just going through some of my records and remembering stuff.  It's funny, many of the thoughts and stories are SO judgemental when listening to myself, but really, isn't that what a birth story is?  Another person's judgement of an experience?  I qualified the stories already, but I still find some of my thoughts rather uncomfortable.  But, some people are just so weird.   laughing   Is that judgemental?  laughing more    Appreciation  -  Marcel continues to hug me when I need it, offer me her baby to hold when I cry, and offer me things like ambrosia.  Connie is loving and embracing.  Donna is always there to listen.  My ChatFriends are a continual source of strength and I live for Monday nights to talk with them.  A lifeline, that's for sure.   Worry  - I worry for my relationship with Sarah.  I get so scared when I think about moving out... moving home to Orlando.  I am just so alone as I run Ama Mama... and Meggie is leaving and Jacqui won't be there and Meital isn't hired to clean or vacuum and the burden really truly is on me and I have babies coming up.  I hope we make enough money that I can hire a cleaning person soon.  I am begging Sarah to put another colonic machine in, but they are $5000, so it will have to wait no matter what.   Anger  - Sarah is telling me we don't have the money to get Meggie the washer and dryer and bed we promised her and she is trying to find the money to drive her to Lubbock.  I told her I didn't care if she pulled the money out of her ass, we were getting Meghann the things she needs; she NEVER asks for anything.   Fear  - I am so afraid I am going to die.  I am afraid I am going to die before everything I want to say is written down.  I hate sleeping because I want to write.  I fall asleep thinking of writing, dream of writing, wake wanting to skip peeing so I can write... drive writing in my head... make notations all day long to write about (forgetting most, surely).  I am so afraid there isn't enough time.  The email from work is overflowing and here I am writing to my Self.   sorta chuckling    Joy  - I am alive today and writing today and have Meggie today and got to see Aimee today and Sarah cleaned the whole house for me today and I have food and medication and growing friendships and goals and desires and dreams and a computer with Net access so I can write until I fall asleep at the keyboard even if everything else falls through the cracks.     I am Joy.

      I am in a race to write everything down.  Why is it that my mind is clear with writing, yet words slur and bounce around my mind and mouth before drooling out?  What is up with that?  The ChatChicks encouraged my starting another blog for birth stories, so I did.    urlLink http://navelgazingbirthstories.blogspot.com/   I can illustrate why I feel a certain way about things instead of sounding like I pulled an answer out of my ass.  I think many on several lists think this sometimes instead of understanding that my answers are after years of thinking, observing, researching, and experiencing certain things.  I do not parrot back what I was taught; never have.  A woman today came in that I have been talking to.  She wants to rent the space at the office for a class.  She told me a story that brought me to tears and reverberated in my head for hours.  Apparently, as a teen, she got pregnant (as a virgin) and, being from a very small mid-western town, her mom took her to another town counties away to see if she was really pregnant, which she already knew she was.  This doctor took her into his office alone and told her that he had to make her have an orgasm before he could tell if she was pregnant or not.  He proceeded to molest her with his hand and, because of her innocence, she had NO idea this was not normal.  It wasn't until YEARS afterwards that she heard of a doctor doing this and when others were shocked, she realized this was not, in fact, normal at all.  Her mother, of course, was horrified when she learned what had happened.  I cannot imagine either soul's pain.  When we were chatting tonight, we were talking about Donna as she was sharing that she might want to be a midwife now.  She had thought of it before, but her previous midwife was so aggressive and Donna had no other experience with midwives, that she thought that that midwife's behavior  was  who and what a midwife is and was.  She said tonight that after her baby's birth with me, she realized that not all midwives were the same at all and that she could see herself as  my  kind of midwife.  I was more flattered and honored than words can share!  I spoke about how important it is to let people know... our toddlers... our neighbors... know there are other ways of being.  It is so much like when those of us who grew up in shit homes... abused, alcoholic, neglected, whatever... and that is normal to us.  Until we are out of the arena and see others' lives, we just don't even think anyone lives any different.  Why doesn't the abused child speak out?  Because she thinks  every  girl gets fucked at night!  Why doesn't the laboring mom tell the midwife to get her hands off her vagina?  Because she thinks that is the way it is supposed to be.   NO ONE SAID IT COULD OR SHOULD BE DIFFERENT!   A woman I am talking with about birthrape issues speaks about her mom witnessing the birth and not saying anything and, months into her postpartum work, she asks her mom why she didn't do anything to stop the midwife from hurting her.  The mom's answer:  Because I thought that was normal... it is what happened to me at my births, too.  It is imperative to create a new normal.  Speaking up, voicing the reality, smashing the illusion of truth is crucial to our Spirit's continuity.  It is much of why I write.

      *  Where the hell are all the nursing babies?  I saw maybe 4 sling babies this weekend and NO nursing at all.  A billion bottles.  I wanted to hold a workshop right there... WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!  What is up with these dykes not birthing normally and nursing as their babies deserve?  I need to do some educating in the dyke community, that's for sure.  I handed out Queer Mom Support Group cards and Dyke Mom Childbirth Classes.  We'll see what happens.  *  I slathered my new bald head (link below to view) with sunscreen, but forgot my feet and  burnt the crap out of them.  I don't think I can wear shoes tomorrow (Rule #1 in the Policies and Procedures Manual).  *  The Spec Pets (also to be viewed below) scared too many people.  2 years in a row, my vagina ideas have scared folks.  Sarah isn't going to want me to offer new ideas ever again!  Last year it was the pics I have taken at births... this year, speculums decorated like toys.  Can I tell you how many people asked if they were used?!  How gross.  Amusingly, I had several moms of teens bring their daughters over so I could show them how Paps are done... and I would describe the Pap... showing how I lube it, insert it slowly sideways, turn it, open it slowly, do the Pap, close it gently, turn it slowly sideways, and remove it.  Then, I said, "and then we make Spec Pets together!"  The mothers laughed; the girls were mortified.  I hugged them and told them I was kidding, that we threw them away and these were brand new ones that no one would use.  They were visibly relieved!  *  One man asked Meghann if they were for putting inside his dogs.  *  Many didn't know what they were, but when they realized it, laughed heartily (but didn't buy them).  *  I sold one to an OB, several to docs and nurses, and to kinky guys.  *  The most common retort, after laughing, was, "Thanks, but I'd rather not have a visible reminder of my Pap."  I just sighed, thinking how hysterical I thought everyone would find them.  Oh, well.  *  Meghann got to see several old friends (and lovers!) of mine this weekend.  One came up and talked to Sarah when I wasn't at the booth and told her she was embarrassed to see me because she was fat and I wasn't.  That was VERY weird.  *  An old lover I hadn't seen in 15 years was there and she is very happy and with a woman for 12 years in Colorado.  It was very odd to be walking in a place I wouldn't normally be (went to the Children's Garden's toilet) and there she was.  She was shocked because I wasn't fat anymore!  She almost fell over looking at my beautiful Meghann (also in a pic in the link below).  *  Meghann began asking me about friends of mine from her past.  She asked about a woman who had twins and I struggled to remember her name.  I didn't like her at all!  Meggie said, "then why did you make us spend the night with her?!" and I said, "probably to have sex with Sarah."  She then proceeded to tell me that for dinner, the woman made oatmeal... no sugar, no brown sugar, no milk... nothing.  And would NOT let my kids get up from the table until they ate it all.  Meghann said Tristan cried, so she ate his oatmeal.  Aimee started crying and Meggie ate hers, too!  What a sister.  She said she is shocked she still loves oatmeal after that traumatic episode.  I apologized and thanked her for being such a good sister.  *  Meghann told me she hated a lot of the kids of my friends.  I felt bad.  *  Sarah and I had a talk this morning that sucked.  Long convoluted story that involves money (of course) and it ended up with her (hopefully) listening to me talk about how I really really feel like I am dying.  I am trying hard not to be dramatic, but I feel so ill inside.  I pray it is the meds, but it doesn't feel that way.  I told her how repulsive I feel, especially with my patchy bald head and I just wanted a couple of baubles to make me feel prettier.  I think she thought I was whining.  I told her that it was painful that she had so much energy for everyone else and I have to nearly have a breakdown for her to hear me tell her how I feel.  *  I want a lover, but have no clue who could put up with me or who would be a lover who didn't want any sex or a lover who had unlimited funds to share for a business that is fighting for its breath.  *  That non-client I did the vag exam on the other day had her baby that same day... and VBAC'd!!!!  I was ecstatic!  I swear I didn't kick-start her.  Swear.  I just believed in her and helped her to relax about being "late."  I shared that these were the last hours her son would be an only child and do something for and with him... and know that her baby would absolutely be there soon and she would then be a mom of two.  She said my words helped tremendously.  I'm glad.  *  Next year, I want to sell those fan-mister thingies.  It was friggin' hot as crap out there.  *  I went barefoot yesterday for awhile (I hate shoes) and got glass in my foot and had to limp down to nearly the end of the festival site to the medical tent.  I hobbled in and asked for a scalpel and they laughed.  They had to clean my foot with about 40,000 wet wipes before they could see the glass.  Then, with tweezers, removed it while I filled out my chart.  The EMS guy said, after getting the glass out, "Well, I don't think it will help avoid infection or anything, but let me clean your foot with alcohol."  I just laughed and laughed because my feet were disgusting porno feet.  *  All day long, I was hollering in Spanish, " Sopla bomberos !" thinking I was saying, "Blow bubbles!"  In reality, I was saying, "Blow Firemen!"  Bubbles is  globos , not  bomberos .  Sarah said the firemen all over San Diego would send me thank you notes.  *  Don't you hate when you can't tell if someone is fat or pregnant?  Sucks as a midwife, especially.  *  I despise Port-o-Potties.  Even with antiseptic wipes, our own toilet paper, and baby wipes, I thought I would hurl with each need to void.  Disgusting.   *  Meggie and I got to the park at 6:30am yesterday to get to the front of the parking on the street right by the gate where you go in.  We do this every year so we can nap in the back of the Explorer when we are exhausted.  It's under a tree and everything.  Last night, when we left (early) at 8:30pm, we got to the front gate where the bike taxi folks were lined up to take people to their cars.  Meggie said, "our car is right there... that first one."  I could read the license plate we were so close.  But, I seriously debated paying $6 for the 40 foot ride to the car.  The bike taxi people laughed.  Meghann howled, "Moooooooommmmmm" like she does and nearly pooped her pants laughing.  *  Getting out last night, we discovered someone crammed in behind us leaving me about 4 inches in back and front to get out.  I hit bumper and bumper and bumper to get out.  Sarah said that is what bumpers are for.  * Tonight's leaving, there were motorcycles... giant motorcycles... parked within an inch of the front and back bumpers!  I called Sarah and asked if it was against the law to hit the motorcycles and run over them if they were blocking me in.  She said she suspected it was.  Meghann and I were so tired (left early again), I had zero patience for such nonsense.  Sarah sent her brother out to try and move them.  Egads, those suckers are heavy.  He maneuvered one enough so I could get out... and then he parallel parked his mom into my spot.  Sheesh.  No consideration for others' needs.  *  Sarah's brother was helpful and kind and not drunk!  I was stunned.  I thanked him for his help.  *  My sleeping massage therapist was a sort of delight as she sold the hell out of the bubbles!  Darren worked hard, too.   *  All the kids (Meghann, Darren, Kim's daughter and her bf) all had to come and say who hit on them throughout the day.  Sarah and I just looked at each other like:  what?  are we chopped liver or what?  *  Sarah was interviewed by ABC last night and we were both interviewed by NBC tonight.  They both made the news.  That would be interviews #21 and #22.  *  Sarah sits for her real estate license tomorrow.  She is nervous.  I am sending her love and gentleness on her Self.  Her mom and brother passed; she will have no problem, but telling her not to study is ridiculous and I would ignore that advice if someone gave it to me, too.  So, I never said anything.  I am trying to make space for her tonight to be able to study.  *  I have appointments all afternoon tomorrow (taking the morning off... I think) and a prenatal in the evening.  I have interviews and HAVE to find a receptionist.  I am going to just be distraught as Meggie leaves in a week, Jacqui goes to training in 2 weeks... I am just going to pull my hair out.  Oh, that's right.  I shaved it off!  *  I am missing the CAM (California Association of Midwives) Board of Director's Meeting this coming weekend.  It is far far and I feel yucky.  I am going to try and do a phone meeting... sitting with them there, but me here.  I'm tired.  More later I am sure.  I miss blogging when I am not here.  I think of things all day that I want to write about.  Writing is so healing for me.  More than I can express.  Okay, so the link... here it is!   urlLink http://www.picturetrail.com/gallery/view?p=999&amp;gid=4884447&uid=631889&amp;members=1

      I was finally proactive in the hair loss arena and had Sarah shave my hair off last night after an exhausting day (15 hours) at the Homo Fest.  My hair isn't 1/8 inch long.  It looks weird, but I don't think I look boyish or anything.  I will get pics today and put them up tomorrow.  I am sad this is even an issue.  I'm tired of feeling so poorly.  *visualizing health and wholeness and LIFE!*  (all together now... health, wholeness, and LIFE!)
