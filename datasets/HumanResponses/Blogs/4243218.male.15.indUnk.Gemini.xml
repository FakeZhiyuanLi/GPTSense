      Well today was a normal monday, just kinda hung around during the morning sleep, eat, eat some more and that was about it.  This afternoon i went rollerblading which was fun i guess, i chased my sister with the hose which was fun.  After dinner i went on a bike ride, had to stop at ace hardware and get some wasp killer, then went to my grandparents sprayed a nest and got attacked by wasps... didnt get stung luckily tho.  Then i went on the trail with silvia, and oh boy was that fun....haha.  First I found a rubber duck, which almost saved our lives (maybe), then it took about 5 mins to cross laport, and then we were attacted my mutant bugs which followed us around and there were thousands!  and they would just spawn in front of us... anyway i got home around 8 and now i sit here typing this thinking about my last free week before school.  Today was a much better day then the weekend, and i hope it continues that way,.

      Well, school is starting soon and i am kinda looking forward to it. I have lots of friends that i didnt get to see much or at all over the summer and i am looking forward to seeing them again.  But the main thing is it will get me out of the house, my only fear tho is that my teacher will be asses and really suck. I will just have to wait and see, i mean we only have ONE WEEK left of freedom!  1. Geometry honors- Babich 2. Comp prog. - Pierson 3. Lunch/study - Saindon 4. English 2- Saindon 5. US hist. - Schiffbauer 6. PE - Natalie 7. Chemistry Honors- Swaney  There be my schedual if anyone cares.  Now for the part i talk about my life.  A lot of stuff has been happening lately, mainly family and friends stuff. My family is going through really difficult situations right now and it makes me just want to lie down and never get up, but i know eventually everything will be ok its just going to take some time and work. I realized something today that we are never all going to be around each other forever and we have to make the best of things. My friends and I went to the movies the other night then out to dinner and we all learned alot about each other that night and well one of my good friends is going though troubled times also and i really hope for him the best.  Damnit anyhow why cant all our lives be perfect i know it just wouldn't be human to have perfect lives but why the hell does shit like this have to happen to take away our most precious things. I sit in my room for hours at a time thinking about life, i dont fall asleep till like 3 in the morning thinking about whats going to happen to me as i get older. I feel like my friends and i are growing apart and i dont want that to happen but in reality we are growing closer... then why do i feel like we dont know each other anymore! I was sitting in my room thinking the other day what if one of my friends left me. I would be a wreck, i mean they are the only people i can talk to about this stuff without then i would go crazy. I spend all day downstairs on the computer sometimes staring at a blank screen because i am to scared to go upstairs and face reality because it is so harsh. Its about time for me to go. Things are beginning to look up tho and hopefully with the start of school i can take my mind off the everyday tasks and complications of life.  Thank you to all who have helped me this summer and my friends you will always be my friends no matter what.  and another quote by yours truly  "A friend is like a lifeline, you need him to get to the million" Drew, Tom, and Marc thanks

(do not worry, others will be longer as they are in drafting at the moment)
