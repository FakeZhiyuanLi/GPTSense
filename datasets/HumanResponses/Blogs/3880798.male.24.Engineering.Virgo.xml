               This is my first blog. Since my college days I was thinkin of puttin a blog, atlast I got some real interest n time for this one. Last weekend is one the most memorable weekends of this year. We seven guys went to Tada falls. I went with my colleagues, they are Prasanna(also my college-mate and room-mate now), Sathia(also my school mate), Elango, Madan, Jayagopal and Selvin. This blog won't b enuf for x'plaining them, so I'll do that later sometime. On saturday morning we planned to start around 10:30am, but that really happened only after Noon. In the mean time me, Prasanna and Madan went to buy the snacks and cakes for trip.                    We started around 12:30 from the office. We were at the Padi signal in 30 mins time and moved towards Tada. From Padi onwards the quality of the road is ultimate. In the tollgate we paid 15 Rs. Its really worth paying for that kind of  urlLink road . We almost reached Tada village around 2 pm. The  urlLink roads  in the village is not that gud for bikes, anyways there were number of guys with bikes. Our sumo slowed down the speed thanx to the roads and the citizens of Tada. It wud hav been rained last nite over there, the roads were wet. Though the cold breeze was not there, it was not hot. There is a checkpost in the inner road to Tada, it wud hav been maintained by the localites. Once again there we paid Rs 60. Fifty for entry into the region and 10 for camera. There At one stage we started walking down as it was pretty hard for the driver cum owner of the sumo felt hard to drive on that road.           After parking the vehicle, we had a gr8 lunch. Now everyone was really enthusiastic towards entering the most awaited Tada falls. Lotsa guys were returning at that time, it was around 3:30pm. We enquired everyone returning the way about the distance to go ahead at various point of time. But everyone one of them stood up in uniformity in giving the same answer that it wud take atleast 1 hr from their respective places. While approaching the dense  urlLink forest , it was almost full of  urlLink rocks  and stones. There was no regular  urlLink passage  to walk all the way to the top of the falls.            The way was full of green trees, monkeys around and it is a great place for  urlLink trekking . We crossed lotsa streams then and there. At one point we reached all most the end of the trek, it was 4:40 then. The water level was just enuf to swim. It was too cold and tasty. We enjoyed a lot even in that water. It wud hav been better if we were on the top of the falls. The time din't permit us to go further up. Then we started back down the way. We were completely exhausted once we reached the sumo back. Around 9 pm we reached Doshi gardens safely.             The lesson we learnt from this trip is that we should start at 6:30 am and reach the parking area in Tada around 8:30. We should reach the falls atleast by 12pm, so that we can spend more time on the top of the Tada falls. Going in bikes is always risky as there were no workshops nearby. If ur vehicle got into troubles then ur trip will also go in the sameway, so takecare of that first.           Anyways this halfway Tada trip will be completed fully sooner than later.
