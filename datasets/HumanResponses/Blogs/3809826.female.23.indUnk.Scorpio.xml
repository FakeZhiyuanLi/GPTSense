      As I excited 287 I thought of starting a poetry journal about Piscataway.    Poems from Piscatway ,  Piscataway Poems .  Everything sounded cheesy.    I'm not sure how I'll do it.  I'll leave that up to the response.  But I feel excited about hearing people's stories about this town.   People always say there is nothing to do in Piscataway-  that Piscataway has no center, "It's boring." Is that the future of this country, or maybe now the present?  As my parents said after their driving trip up and down the coast- "We passed so many strip malls- Bed Bath and Beyond, Applebee's."  There must be stories of Piscatway's memorable places-  cliches or suprises or maybe just memories of where the roads used to go, what we used to pass on the way to-   I have nine months left here.   I'm getting sentimental.

      Ran around 'town' taping and tacking flyers to anywhere that seemed permisable- the lady at the train station told me in an accent "I sorry, they take down, not allowed"   So I took my flyer down and taped it on a concrete pillar commuters pass as they come back home. Now I realize it will rain tonight and a black mess will drip to the sidewalk.  Ok but enough bad imagery! Let us stick to the reporting here.   I'm thinking- maybe there is a reason regular towns don't have poetry journals?  Because there are no willing poets? Or people brave and silly enough to use the word poet?   My man says I am crazy.   I do not know if this is crazy good or crazy bad or crazy it might work?   No one responded to the flyer yet.  Seven days and zero messages in my in-box.      I felt happy driving away from the posted flyers seeing them flap- but I also imagined angry consumers and business owners tearing them down and balling them up.   My current goal:  Receive one submission!  Publish one issue with one submission!   Come on college students- prove to me you are idealistic and love to rip little tabs off flyers and part-is-a-pate

      I think it is hailing.  I'm going to check.  Yep! Big time hail!   Today I lost some excitement for the project.   This usually happens to me.  Driving through the residential neighborhoods of Piscataway this morning, I wondered, "Would any of these people really care to read a poetry journal?"   At work I read the top five chronic errors a small business owner makes.    One was-  expecting an overwhelming interest for your product , project.   Another-  advertising in the wrong market, not knowing your audience .   I'd been planning to post a flyer in the two local libraries and the grocery store. I am not sure about the high school or bus stops.    Last night I lay in bed thinking of ways to draw people to my flyer.     POEMS WANTED  or   SIGN UP FOR OUR MAILING LIST    Should I only accept submissions via e-mail?   I did not want to show my home address.   How do you go about getting a PO Box?   Should there be a minimum number of submissions?  Should I put up a flyer and then decide on format, details, issue type depending on the response? Yes I think so.   I was getting carried away- expecting a huge resopnse.   I've riled myself up to excitement levels again.  I'm going to work on a flyer now.
