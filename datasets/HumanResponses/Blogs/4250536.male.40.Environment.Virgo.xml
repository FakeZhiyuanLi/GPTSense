        Do you like our owl?          Artificial?          Of course it is.          Must be expensive?          Very !  I'am Rachael          Deckard.          It seems you "feel" our work is not a benifit to the public.          "Democrats" are like any other machine, they are either a benifit or a hazard, if they are a benefit it's not my problem.          Ever retire a human by mistake?

       I don't know what was up with that funky sentence structure, in  that last blog but I did not plan it.  This thing sofar to quote the great Art Carney  has been "like crazy, baby", he actually did say that you just had to be there to hear it.  And it's been a little strange to get used to the structure.  Lastly what follows is the last test of the day.            Testing one, two, three, four.  This is a test of the color white which comes up blank on the posting page.  If it looks great I will use it, but I will not be sorry for the errors!  Thanks for the training day. peace out!

        This may finally be working,  this should look great on a black back ground but it's almost imposible to see on the white page  which is used to compose on.  The whole point is to see what I am doing.  But I am glad to make this progress.                                         Time now for the reading of the day, but before it looks like two different colors:          maybe I will try for three.                             "With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage                           factory the family had a first hand knowledge of the great majority of Packing-                           town swindles."  chapter 14 of "The Jungle"         Depending on where you stand, this sounds like either the new "dirty tricks" of the right, or the dastardly plans lady Hilliary got cooking in her coven.  You think about it!

      I hope I will enter twice today, but i my not for this on is just to test the color.  I meant to test the color with my last entery, even selected one, thought I confirmed it but I was wrong!  Now with this blog it's more test and less anything.  And lastly, due to this being the worst work type of week-end does not help either.  Soon not only will I select colors, I will select if going BOLd, will help also!  For it's the plain ole ability to see the blog myself, wait til you're 40, and have to read what's going on.  Lastly for this blog I plan to choose a passage in music or book to set the tone of the blog.                                                                                       you scream and shout and you make a scene                                                                                     when you open your mouth you never say what you mean                                                                                      say what you mean, oh say what you mean                                                                                      Go back to Greenville, just go back to Greenville                                                                                      Empty bottles and broken glass                                                                                      Busted down doors and borrowed cash                                                                                      Borrowed cash, oh the borrowed cash  That's right Hilliary the cash to borrowed the the taxpayer, and never plan to give back !

      Here I am!  I'am back!  the sane inmate, back to have fun with the world lovin crazies, while setting to battle once again with nurse Ratched!  Whom herself as come back from hell as Sen. Hilliary Clinton, the woman whom is going to tell us: what to eat, what to drive, where to work, where to live, and lastly for now this new nurse Ratched is going to drug us from birth to death, with mind altering drugs, so that if we dare vote anything but Democrat the supply will be cut off.  Well I spit the "free" taxpayer paid for Lithium back in her face, and as long as I am able to work and actually pay taxes I will work agaist, these sounds good on the surface,  but dangerous in practice polices which will in time hurt every actual American.  By the way there is one lefty guy you should here on your stream machine, Sunday (1-3pm,edt) at  urlLink www.630wmal.com . he's an old hippie but he has some good points.  But he's has been diluted by the false dreams of the left.

      This is a test entery, the next entery will be gathering information from different sources.  Then that information will be presented in a way that will foster a more indepent thought.

      this is the first word.  let's get together so that actual interaction can take place.  We need to rise above our current goverenment.  That first means the ending of all social programs, and the democratic party.  Join me now, or be my enemy, your choice!  I act and respond to those whom hate individual freedom!   This is the place for those whom want to fight "the system", and restore America to the "representitive republic" that it is.
