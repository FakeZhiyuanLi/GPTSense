      I read Ch. 2 of D'Andrade's book yesterday, and most of Ch. 3  In the early phases of it's development, cognition theory was used to explain and understand linguistics. There was a whole  part of the chapter devoted to this with numerous examples.   Another large part of the chapter talked about how it can explain kinship terms. For example, the words we use to define kinship are culturally relevant, and we use certain words and terms to group people into categories, like Aunt/Uncle, cousin, brother/sister. The units of the structure could be identified only in terms of their relationship with other terms. In making up the structure, teh parts define each other, and in defining each other, the parts make a structure.   Chapter 3 was more useful to me. It defined some terms used when talking about linguistics that helped me make sense of how cognition theory was applied. Some words (polysemic words) have more than one meaning- we can mean several different things when using a polysemic word.   Also, our short term memory limits our cognition, because it limits how many things we can identify and remember at a time. Chunking helps us with this- grouping things together. LIke numbers, similar terms. Without chunking we would be extremely limited in what we could discriminate and therefore remember. Analogies also help us with this- they ignore differences in attributes and point out similarity in relationships.

      I was out of town last week, but now I'm back and working hard on theory!!  I got a very positive e-mail from Dr. G last night saying that I was on the right track, and also saying that my insights were good and that I had brought up some interesting points. He recommended a few books: The Post-modern Condition by Jean Francois Lyotard (which of COURSE I will read, as I am a huge fan of postmodernism) and a book by Pierre Bourdieu called Reproduction in Education, Society, and Culture. This second book sounds much less interesting, but I will check it out anyway- I'm sure it will be useful :)  Yesterday I took notes on the first chapter of D'Andrade's book, The Development of Cognitive Anthropology.   D'Andrade defines cognitive anthropology as the study of the relationship between human society and human thought. (I loved this definition, because it was very clear and didnt' throw in any words like discourse or enculturation or anything else intended to make the author appear superior and the reader to feel stupid.)  It is the study of the ways that people in social groups (societies, subcultures, etc.) concieve of and think about teh objects and events which make up thier world. This includes everything from physical objects like houses and clothing to abstract events like chairty and social justice.   Ch. 1 is a lot of background- D'Andrade goes all the way back to the dawn of Anthropology. He says that ethnography was originally the observational study of the ways of life of "primitive" people, which of course bothered me, because "primitive" implies social evolution, which I think is crazy (I will expand on this later). He expands on this, saying that early ethnographers were interested in the ways in which particular cultural traits diffused from one society to another, and that they were strongly divided on whether or not societies evolved in a series of stages from simple hunting people to complex urban civilizations or were simply involved in non-evolutionary, non-directional, multiple processes of change- an argument that is still not resolved.   He also brings up an idea of "agenda hopping" where he talks about how the focus of the discipline has changed over the years. I wasn't really very clear on this- I'll have to talk about it with Gordon. He said that the new agenda of the early 20th century (which sounds like it would be obsolete by now, right?) is "focused on the detailed examination of how the institutions of society are integrated together to make society function." These institutions of society are not just a jumble of traits, but rather  a set of learned and prescribed activities which are coordinated with one another to bring about a satisfactory way of life and maintain social order .  I have to briefly talk about social evolution and why it bothers me so much. It is completely arrogant and ethno-centric. We evolve into more powerful and complex societies? Why is this deemed something as noble as "evolving"? I think sometimes this theory is completely backwards- that in some cases societies that are seen as "primitive" are really more advanced in some areas than our own. What are the attributes used to judge this evolution and advancement? Poverty? Illness? Longevity? Procreation? Weapons of mass destruction? Military Power? Material wealth? Some of these things have no place in "advanced" society, depending on who's opinion you hear.   And of course, this whole theory was devised by western culture, putting themselves at the very top, as the standard for all societies that are still evolving....

      I just had a brief conversation with my friend Mike about cognition theory. He was asking me about my classes for the summer, and I told him about the one on cognition theory, and he said that he had just heard about that today in one of HIS classes (he's not an anthropologist- this was in a communications class). So we talked about it, and he said that I explained it the same way as his professor, which made me feel good, and made me feel like I knew what I was talking about!!! Yay!!!  THEN we applied it to our own lives. We talked about how we group ourselves with people, and how we disassociate ourselves with others.   It was really cool :)

      Hopefully, this will be a facilitator of communication! I'm taking a "special problems course" this summer, where I will read about Identity theory and Cognition theory, and use what I learn in the development of my thesis. I'll write about the things that I learn and read about here, so that Dr. Gordon can read them while he's out of the country :)

      The Anthropology of Experience ed. Victor Turner and Edward Bruner I read the intro of this last night, and this morning read some of the articles in it. I loved it- I loved the thinking behind it.   Basically, Turner and Bruner are saying that there is a difference between reality and experience. That we "experience" reality, but in effect everyone experiences it differently. BUT, they also say that expression- in the form of books, narratives, art, ritual, etc., is someone's account of the experience, and by looking at these expressions, we can have a glimpse of how this person experiences reality. I guess that is what I'm doing with my teachers- I'm having them produce some of these expressions in the form of narratives, to help me understand their experience of being a teacher.    I also pulled a few gems from this:  - Cultural change, cultural continuity, and cultural transmission all occur simultaneously in the experiences and expressions of social life. - The advantage of beginning the study of culture through expressions is that the basic units of analysis are established by the people we study rather than by the anthropologists as alien observer. By focusing on narriatives/dramas/ect. We leave the definition of the unit of investigation up to the people, rather than imposing categories derived from our own ever-shifting theoretical frames. (which is why it is a good idea to let the teachers themselves shape the research)  It left me thinking about experiences, and how much you really can learn from listening to people- from absorbing their expressions.

      tonight I did some reading concerning the Anthropology of experience- it was fantastic. I took a ton of notes on it, which I will type up tomorrow morning. Good stuff. Victor Turner.

      Last night I had dinner with my parents and my dad asked what I was writing my thesis on (as he always does) and I gave him such a fantastic answer:  I'm writing about the conflict that teachers face between their personal and professional identities, and the different ways that they resolve this conflict.

      I've been in the library for a long time... and I have found a million books to check out! I'm excited about them!  And, I almost recalled a book that I looked up because it was checked out. But then I realized that I was the one who had checked it out. :)  I also printed out an application from cy-fair isd to fill out. And I am going to go out to KISD tomorrow because I haven't been able to talk to anyone about my application and I don't want it to fall through the cracks.

      I've been thinking a lot about ingroups and outgroups.   I've been working on the thesis... and it's actually going pretty well!!! The lit review is on hold though- the stuff that I'm doing in my other summer class is going to play into that a LOT, so I'm just waiting a little bit.   Also, I need to take out a lot of the gender stuff. I put that in because my professor last semester told me it was necessary, even though I didn't really want this thing to go in that direction. But for right now I'm leaving it as it is. I'm not sure why... maybe I'm just afraid to take it out.   I still havent' heard back from the school district. I am anxious about this. I really want it to work out.

      I wanted to write this yesterday, but wasn't near a computer. But I was able to hiest a friend's laptop....  I went to a birthday dinner for one of my high school kids on Friday night. It was a beautiful example of how we create schemas as a way to organize people. There were a lot of kids there that I didn't know, so I was asking one of my favorite girls who they were and if they went to our church (because I need to know the kids who go to our church, because I'm leading their bible study next year).  So, I looked down the table and saw one of the girls who was in my cabin at camp. I know that this girl has a boyfriend, and there was a boy sitting next to her, so I asked my informant if that boy was so and so's boyfriend, and she gave me a funny look. She said "no!!! her boyfriend kisses girls and almost has sex!!!!! That guy has never even held hands with a girl!!! Geez, Nora!!!!!!" And as some backup information about my informant, she has never had a boyfriend, which she is very proud of, and has also probably never done any of the things that she thought this other girls boyfriend had done.   It was interesting to me that she chose "sexual experience" as a schema in which to classify these people- it must be something that she thinks about. It was definitely clear that she grouped this boy within her own ingroup, and the experienced boy outside. It also gave me insight into the way that she thinks about these groups- I think that she put some judgement on the experienced boy. It also gave me insight into what she thinks about- she obviously must think about her own level of experience often, if it is a means by which she classifies others. I wonder if she groups girls in this same way, or just boys.

      Ok. I have been working on my proposal for the last few days. It's hard- I feel like I don't know where to start and don't know what to say. I have to get over this and write a great proposal.   I want to graduate in May. In order to do that, I must write a proposal and start doing my research.   Also, I am always feeling that I'm behind, and this is ridiculous.  A year ago I wasn't even in graduate school. I am at the same point as many of my friends who have been in school for a year longer than I. I can do this!! I'm Nora!!!  I have talked to my informants several times this week- just chit chatty kind of stuff. One major informant is dreading going back to school, and is keeping busy with a GRE course, even though she doesn't know what she wants to get a masters (or phd) in. I love this girl- I will have to think of an alias for her. Anyway, she's so ambitious, and very capable- very intelligent- I'm sure she can do anything she wants. She is also one of the teachers who left a title one school this year- she still has title 1 students in her school, and she says that she moved because it was closer to her house. I'll have to ask her about that a little more.

      Today I had a great meeting with my advisor.  Things are looking really good- I'm feeling good about things.   We talked different ways to bring up my research objectives to the school district where I will (hopefully) be working- I need to ease them into it.   Also, as far as human subjects go, I can wait at least until September.   Ok- here was the big thing- I need to write my proposal. This scared me! It just seems so big and ... intimidating. So, he suggested that I write a little every day- make a draft tonight and then "revise" it every day until our next meeting, which is next Tuesday. That made it easier to think about, and made it seem like a more manageable task. :)

      I started filling out the human subjects forms tonight and it's not going to be that bad- it will actually be really good to think about all that stuff. I'm going to get my advisor to help me with it tomorrow. It will help me to actually write out the stuff again.   I took my application to the school district- I'm kind of excited about it :) I hope they hire me!! It will be so perfect! A lot of driving, but otherwise, perfect!

      so today I am going to take my application out there, provided that I can find my transcript from UT.  &nbsp; Problem statement: Why do teachers leave low income schools? What is it about the culture of teh school that makes them leave? &nbsp; I have been thinking about sub-cultures- trying to think of teachers as more of a subculture. Or a culture. I am seeing parallels with two other cultures that I hear about: the Christian subculture and the French Ex-patriot subculture.  &nbsp; Also, I'm tired.

      I went to the central office for the ISD where I'd like to work, and saw someone I went to high school with. I think I'm making the right decision in using this district- I think that between my mom and I, I can have some strong connections to some top-notch informants.   So, that's what I did yesterday. On their website, there were four teachers aid positions, and three were Title 1. I have to say that the application process is a little ricidulous. They need recommendation letters, a copy of my high school diploma, back ground check stuff, proof of employment from former employers, college transcripts. All this for a job that only requires a high school diploma or GED. As someone who is working on her masters degree, I even feel slightly intimidated by this process. I wonder if that discourages people from applying?

      I spoke with an informant today- I actually spent all day with her. She confirmed that yes, a lot of new teachers leave title 1 schools. She was saying that at her school, ALL of third grade had left this year, for one reason or another. That's a lot of teachers!  She was saying that it's really hard to work at these schools- and that it can be discouraging, because even if you are a fantastic teacher, you can't compete with the other influences in the kid's life- they feel that they don't make a difference. She also said that the older teachers seemed to handle it a little better, that they felt that they COULD at least provide a positive environment for the time when the child was at school (she also thought that maybe it had to do with the fact that the older teachers had thier own children, and had them to worry about, and knew that they DID have control over the quality of thier lives).   I also got some information from her about being a teacher's aide- I need to call the central office tomorrow to follow up on that.

      I met with my advisor today, and it went pretty well. Sometimes he really intimidates me and I don't know what to say. I don't know how to answer his questions sometimes....  Anyway... he said that I need to stop changing my mind and settle on one research problem so that I can be done in May or August and graduate. So... the real-world problem that I am using is that there is a lot a of "turnover" in low income schools- that is, a lot of teachers put in for transferrs after being there for a few years. Why does this happen? What changes in the teachers when they become enculturated into this culture of the low income school? Why would they rather be at a different school?  Why is this anthropology? Because I think that the reason they leave the schools is because of the ways they learn to identify themselves during thier time as a teacher there. I think it's a problem of pre-teaching identity and post-teaching identity. Or perhaps they feel that this kind of position doesn't fit with thier current personal identity, and they can't find a way to reconcile their personal and professional identities....  He also gave me some advice about coursework, and I'm only going to take one class next semester, and the rest thesis hours. AND I am going to do a little research concerning a position as a teachers aid at a low income school....  In all, it was a really good meeting, and I hope I can keep this all narrow and straight to the point and get done in one more year :)
