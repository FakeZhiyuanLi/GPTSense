      Well if you managed to stumble upon this little excuse for a blog, welcome. If i sent you here, then im glad your reading. Finally if your reading this 20 years into the future in a world controlled by machines when I am rich and famous and own one of the world most proficient websites (obviously not this one) then this is how I started. In any case im glad that your here reading the rants about my life. I am from Lating America, i am a Latin gamer, and i am in fact a Latin gamer/artist. All this makes me who i am, i enjoy all types of music, anime, downright regular art, and most of all games. Now what really gets to me is that this in some cases might be the profile of a geek. If this is so then i am a geek, you can now proceed to throw stones at me. Ive been part of the internet community for many years now, at the age of 17 i currently stand a member of about 6 different forums, one of which has many of my online friends who are as crazy, if not more than me. I have been a member of this group for what i could consider to be around 4 or 5 years. This tiny group that now unites itself at our friend kyles website, kylesdesktop has known each other for a long time. Most of us met through the online game runescape where they started a group called rs trivia, you figure out what it was all about, later i joined and everything remained the same. The reason i mention the things i do is very simple in fact, it was the start, at that time i joined my first forum, i met my oldest and most dear internet family, and eventually led to this. that is my start, my origins if you will. all very simple and humble if you will. Not only was that my start as a forum whore, but it was my start as a online RPG maniac. Now dont get me wrong ive been playing games since i was able to grip the controller without dropping it, but this was a phase that changed my life, and all thanks to RS. these days i play a little of everything, battlefield, jedi knight 2, black and white, zelda, final fantasy, and a little halo at a friends house. Laugh all you want most of my games are outdated. its the year 2004 and i havent bought a serious internet based game in a while, i should go get battlefield vietnam...  E3 was this past week. This is one of those great times for gamers like myself who are hungry for information on their favourite games, for me it was the new zelda trailer that really did it for me. I consider myself a mixed game fan, i like everything from a good fight to a good adventure and a good shooter, but in my opinion there is one game for every genre that defines what comes after. For fighting games it was street fighter 2 and mortal kombat. For Rpg games theres Final fantasy and Final fantasy 7, chrono trigger also stands in here. Adventure games include my favourite Legend of Zelda amongst other. First person shooters include half life, Doom, battlefield, and counterstrike. and platformers include mario, sonic, and megaman, all these ive played, all these i love, games made me who i am and i wont ever stop playing them. As ridiculous as ill look when im 80 and im playing virtual reality games or whatever is out then, ill be with my grandsons owning their butts =P This is just th basics of me, if you managed to stick so far you can notice i write as i think, i get bitched at for this often but i dont mind, its fun =). anywho, future me if your reading this, i hope you got that damned jeep ive been wanting for so long. for everyone else expect semi daily updates if i have anything to ramble on, life can get pretty interesting =)
