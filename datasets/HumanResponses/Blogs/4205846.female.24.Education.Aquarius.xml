        Is it odd that I have this addiction to all things Pride and Prejudice?  I love the book, love the A&E special, love the fanfiction.  In fact so much, that I went and found dozens of sites so that I can read and read and read and read...to the exclusion of all other fanfiction.  Which is....unreal, for me.  I have a lot of Harry Potter, Inu-Yasha, The Mummy, Stargate Sg-1, etc stories that I was addicted to and now don't even bother with.   Have I graduated to a higher realm of fanfiction?  Is that kinda snobby?  Or is it just, a grand ol' story....a true classic that touches the heart of people? An archetype myth with the Hero and Heroine and their journey with help from anima and objects, a descent into the underworld, and then a rebirth?  Sorry, I got all Carl Jung on your asses, didn't I?  I still don't get it though....why am I so drawn to this story? These characters?  I think it's the reluctant romantic in me, dying to get out.  After all, I have the romance of a rock.  I leave it all up to the pros and just revel in what's created around me....like in those stories.        Bruce just said "apparently all educated girls have a thing for Pride & Prejudice".   And I wonder,.....my friends...I don't think many ever actually read the book.  How about you, RandomDeb?  You've seen the A&E special, right? Colin Firth?  I mean, who wouldn't just swoon over Mr. Darcy? I mean, after telling him off?  I think we all want to be Elizabeth Bennet.  Smart, sassy, witty and pretty, with a rich man panting after her?  Oh yeah ;-)        So, I'm off to get back into my current story.  Gotta feed my addiction.        Evil PilotFish      Hello, my name is Evil Pilot Fish...and I'm a Pride&amp;Prejudice-aholic who lives on Evil PilotFish Lane.

       hey guys,      epf, i hope classes yesterday went ok! it was so funny walking into the snack bar thingy and seeing you there. btw, just let me know when you wanted to drop your car off at that car place-- i can do it just about any day of the week.       so this morning. ugh. pissy. epf, remember that light we have to sit at forever after getting off at the oconee st. exit? well i was there this morning and in front of my was huge truck pulling a mini-bulldozer behind it. i'm always paranoid that those huge metal tracks (the ones that lower so that you can drive the bulldozer onto the truck) are gonna just come loose and fall on the hood of my car. HENCE, i left about a car's length btwn it and me. well i was just sittin there, and all of a sudden a huge white suv drives up beside me and cuts in front of me! bastard!! it really really angered me. so i did what i always do and pulled up right behind his bumper. man, i was so mad. it totally made my friday start badly.      blahhhhhhhh. how you guys doin?    ps.  this is interesting... n-man asked me yesterday how much $$ he should put in his wife's bank account to start her off after she came to the states.  i told him i had no clue, and he asked me if $10k sounded good or if that was too little.  i was like, DUDE.  if a woman can't live off of 10k, there's something terribly wrong with her.  it's not like she has to pay for any living expenses as it is, in addition to getting a monthly allowance, so to speak.  that's a hella lot of money.  sometimes i'm glad i'm poor, but other times i wish i had a little nest egg too.

       *from far off a figure emerges from a cloak of darkness. Her clothes are torn, her skin caked with dust and grime, her glasses broken, and her hair mussed.  [stop reading this bruce] [thankyou] Exhausted, she bends at the waist, resting her hands on her knees while gasping for air.  She coughs, hacks and then straightens, preparing to speak.*  YO YO YO!!!!  Wuzzup?  Yeah, I'm a lazy ass who has been snickering and nodding in sympathy over the past posts, while ignoring my own responsiblity of adding to this blog.  That's right, I'm lazy.    Classes started today....hopefully won't be a pain in the rear.    Wish I had a crappy work story to share with you guys, but I haven't had a great temp position to complain about in awhile.  Can I complain that I don't have a job?   I"m strapped for cash, tuition is expensive, my car's dying, can't pay the bills....and yet I'd suck it up and take a crap job with at least some incoming fundage.   um, yeah......so....let's just move on, shall we?     I'm gonna go now.   Back to the depths of ......someplace deep.  yeah. :-P  Evil Pilot Fish  I'm an Evil Pilot Fish!  I speak Evil-Pilot-Fishanese.

       hey publius,      you are a hero among disgruntled employees everywhere.  i'm hoping that your IT people will be too stupid to realize just how you're getting around the rules they made up.        i too am plagued by some of the people i work with, although in totally different ways than the hellhole you work in.  i don't really feel like i should speak on this topic while AT work though, so more to come at a later date.        in other news, we get our phoneline hooked up today.  also, our floors should be waxed soon--i talked to the landlord yesterday (b/c it was sposed to be completed YESTERDAY) and she said they'll be here as soon as possible.  argh!  i want a kitchen table darnit.        it appears as if the evilpilotfish is MIA.  any clue as to her whereabouts?      ~THE supavixen.

      My job is pissing me off.  It's a good gig. I get along with the people in my group. The projects are interesting and, indeed, I have fun when I'm allowed to get on with it. There's pretty good job security too. According to my boss noone gets fired for anything. The problem is that i'm  not  allowed to get on with it. Here comes a series of rants about why it is becoming more and more of a crock.  INSTANT MESSAGING     My group is kind of spread out in the office, but not so much. We used AIM to (among the normal uses) talk to each other quickly without having to stop what we were doing. A few months after I started at the company, someone got a bug up their ass and started blocking AIM for the entire building. Being nerdly developers, my group and I got around the block by varuous means for a while, but the network guys slowly erected a very thorough barrier. AIM was followed shortly by the other major services and thus ended my group's ability to quickly get ideas, information, or help from our collective network of developer friends. This also  cut off one of our three means of communication with the outside world. Leaving us with email and telephone.  I don't understand the motivation!  Do they think that instant messaging is an inherently inferior means of communication, and in their arrogance decided to enforce their view on all of us? Bullshit. Using instant messaging as a means of businss communication can't do anything but help a person's productivity because it is fundamentally suited to multitasking.  A phone conversation requires almost all your attention. You can't get any work done while you're yakking away to someone on the phone. Phone conversaions also contribute to noise pollution in cube farms. Just try to concentrate when the person in the next cube won't shut the fuck up. Email is just as bad, if not worse, than using the phone with regards to requiring all your attention. You can't very well write code and an email at the same time. Email also has the nasty drawback that you can't get a quick answer like you can with IM or with a phone call. People don't stare at their email client all day. Instant messaging is the ideal form of communication when you need a quick response with minimum interruption from the task at hand. Do they think that if their employees are allowed to use instant messengers we'll spend all day uncontrollably talking to friends instead of working? That's crap. If a person has no self-control they can just as easily waste all their time writing emails and calling people. I don't know what their problem is, but this shit is getting in my way.

      can consider it stuck to himself. Last week got more frustrating as the week progressed. The content filter suddenly started blocking Blogger.com as soon as I wanted to start going there regularly and the AIM blockade was seriously pissing me off. So when I got to work this morning I decided that I wasn't going to do any work until I figured out a way to get on AIM and get around the content filter. I did. So now I'm on AIM and I can get to blogger. Take that network trolls!!!  -PubliuS the Syndicated Bastard  p.s.  Anyone know how to set up a signiture in this blogger thing? Nevermind. I worked out the sig.

        I want to be an Immortal, preferrably a really old one.  I would have liked to die sometime during the early Classica Greek era.  I bet people would have thought I was a goddess, maybe Athena reborn? Then someone could build a temple to me and I'd get my own Chariot and thousands of dumb people following me.         I could get them to dress me in a great togas and lots of jewels. I'd like that. :-D   And put some inscense around me, give me a throne, a big statue, and i'd be a happy little Goddess.       Okay, that's about it.     I'm an Evil Pilot Fish! And I live on Evil Pilot Fish Lane!

       a great many things actually.      1) publius, can you access this at work?  i know you're essentially cut off from life as we know it while you're doing whatever it is you do in that black hole called "my cube."        2) is my dad going through a mid-life crisis?      3) why do squirrels bark?      4) what exactly is a brain slug?      if you can answer any of the above, i'll give you.... uhm...       oh!  so i was watching family guy and futurama on adult swim the other night-- theyre SO funny.  in futurama bender gets involved with the Ultimate Robot Fighting League... and one of the contestants was "the foreigner,"  who promptly stood up and waved his robotic arms and yelled, "i'm not from around here!!! look at my passport!"  haha it was friggin hilarious.       urlLink http://www.gotfuturama.com/cgi-bin/imageview.cgi?/Multimedia/FrameGrabs/2ACV08/Grabs/pic00233.jpg

        Oh La!  Random Deb tells me we're starting a blog, and as her loyal sidekick, I obey.  After all, I need those Supervixen lessons.  And she lets me dress down to work .HA! Can I ask for a better She-ro?!  No!        What is all the rage about these blog things anyway? Do people actually care what I'm writing about?  I don't even care what I'm writing about!  That's sad, isn't it?  I mean, what does that say about my self-esteem?  That I have none?!  WHat am I worth?!?!  (are you people buying this crud?  am I anguished enough yet?)  WOE IS ME!          I'm gonna go now.        BWAHAHAHAHAhahahahaaaaa! I have defaced your post! -PubliuS, The Syndicated Bastard

      After being sucked into a meeting at work where blogging was discussed, I decided to check this out and see what all the fuss was about.  And thus, we have the first post.
