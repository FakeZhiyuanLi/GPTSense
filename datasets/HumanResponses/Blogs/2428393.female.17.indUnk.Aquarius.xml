      everytime i have a crush, i'm always hoping for something that might not come true. i always end up daydreaming about him, i can't concentrate on the things i'm doing. sometimes, i convience myself that the guy i like might like somebody else, but i still like him.  maybe the word  martyr  is next to my name. i'm always waiting for the right guy but i always falling with the wrong guy. a friend e-mailed me about what those the selection their mean, the question # 8 asked to choose a # between 1-10..i choose 8..and it says thare that's the number i will fall in love before i get married..that's so weird. ok, i admit it..i easily fall in love with a guy that is really sweet,nice, good-looking and accepts me for who i am.. gtg..i've got some work to do..

      after the work i'm doing everyday..i still find the chance to sitback and relax to a hot and not that comfortable room..but slow music in the background. in that hot and not comfortable room, i realize lots of things. like being alone in a valentine's day in my 4-teenage years.  yup, i always say "i hate valentines day, it's just for the couples who love each other." ok, it 's a big lie the night i realized it..we should celebrate the valentines day that we really love and care for like our families and true friends. the next time that valentines day will come, i'll invite my whole barkada to have fun.  every entry i publish here would be my feelings and realizations in my hot and not that comfortable room.. :) i hope it can help you to realize things too..

      one of my friends told me that their is a big change to her attitude. i think she changed after what happened tonight. and not only her but all of them. and i'll be honest, i've changed..a lot! honestly, i'm afraid to tell them what i really feel about our friendship. i'm always hidding what i feel, one of my friend told me that  i might comit suicide  if i don't tell anyone the problems i'm keeping to myself. i'll not comit suicide, and i don't want to hurt myself.  anyways, i'll change for the better.
