      On duty again. Past few days difficult. Received a Vappor works high rise for my Spyder. My paintball gun is getting better and better. Received a Gentoo Linux CD set (generic install, Pentium4 specific, AthlonXP specific) and a Gentoo t-shirt. Hope the guy who created Gentoo Linux gets enough support to repay his debts.His product is amazing. Too bad he left the developement... F**K!!! My freedom day has moved further away ... I thought i would be free at the 1st of July but apparently it won't happen until the 20th of that month ... 20 More days of service ... AAAARGH!!!! Had a few moments to work on my software project with minimal results if any ... I need more time ... maybe i should move it to one of my servers so as to work on it over the internet ...  Over the next few days i will have many "social obligations". I hate loosing my time like this. Stil haven't received my Hackademy Magazine... Why does it take so many days for something to get from France to Greece ?? It is three hours to travel from Athens to Paris on airplane, but it is almost two weeks since i made my order. Maybe i should start investigating the possibility of mail loss...

      After spending a day and a half inside the camp i got home yesterday at 16:00 just to leave again for a meeting. I met with my father and an associate to discuss the new company i will set - up. Our targets are realistic and may father being a salesman for 35+ years will be of great assistance. I slept at 00:15 and got up at 12:07. I needed that sleep.  Today I fixed Helen's (my girlfriend's) car and just sent (FINALLY) the update to my client in Rhodes island, since I didn't have the time to send it earlier.  I will start two projects. One is a software project I have been designing for a long time now and the second is a secret project (sorry can't disclose details if it goes on well i will release it in public).  The software project will be L.A.M.P. - J. based (Linux apache MySQL php with a littil bit o' Java) and will for the basis for all the intranet projects i will undertake from its completion and on. The goal is to create a SAP-like base which will be transformable to any data manipulation project the client will need. I already have a crude first version available but i will start from scratch so as to cure all problems i found in the course of the first experiment.   I will have an e-mail for communication about my blog and what i write in it, since i don't want my primary email to be flooded with spam ( no offence for any one legitimate e-mailer no matter what he says in his email, i mean these stupid people who try to extract emails from such pages so as to send their useless and annoying ads ).  Today i picked up the present for Helen. (The saint who has her name is celebrated at 21st May. In my country it is a tradition to celebrate one's name the day that the corresponding saint is celebrated, i don't know if this happens in other countries too...)  I still wait for a few parts for my paintball gun. I will describe my Spyder in a later post, when i receive the parts i wait for. Too bad i don't have much money to buy a better board for it, to brake the 13bps limit. I think i will get the T-board. Or should i take the IS-board ??? But only when i find some money ... I will definitely get a Q-loader. I believe that it is really innovating and worth a look. It is cheaper than a Halo B and feeds more than 30BPS !!!  SH** !! i need to get some more money! I may start teaching programming ... or maybe put a classified ad in the papers to find some more clients for network servicing ... Tomorrow is the supermarket day. Got to go shopping for home. Helen is passing an "Entry" examination tomorrow in English. If she passes the test with a good grade she will be able to go for the "Proficiency" diploma in six months if she doesn't get a good grade she will be examined for "Proficiency" in a year. Good Luck Helen ...

      Today's mission / todo list :  a) retrieve my fax machine from my ex - partners' office and install it in mine. b) buy a spare thermostat for my girlfriend's car and install it if possible.  c) check the internet connrction of a client. d) e-mail to a client in Rhodes island an update for the publishing program i wrote for them.  Comments:  a)Before joining the army i had a company setup with 3 more associates. When i was called for duty they broke up the company and started their own. They took most of my stuff with them. Gradually i took everything back now that my service is reaching the end (no fights or anything, we are ok, just don't do business together any more). My Fax machine and a few Photoshop PSDs is what remains to be retrieved which i hope to do right now.  b)My girlfriend bought a used 20 years old Zastava Yugo (Yugoslavian cars with Fiat internals). She intends to get used to driving with it. Although she has her license many years now, she has, virtually, no driving experience. A few days ago, while she was driving around our home looking for a place to park, vapor came out of the hood. Verdict : destroyed thermostat. Lucky we didn't "burn" the poor engine ... I will buy a couple of these AND install a bypass switch for the ventilator so as not to have any such trouble again.  c)A router gone bananas dialed to the internet all day for a couple of months charging a client about 2k&euro;. He canceled the phone line and now that the router is fixed he ordered the line again. My task is to do the final check and make sure all is ok.  d)Emailing an update is no big deal ... The problem is that i have to test it first and that is a BORING thing to do ...

      This is my first Blog. Content posted here is my thoughts, research and projects. I am interested in anything so email me interesting stuf on technology, physics etc. . . &lt;warining&gt; my english sux! &lt;/warning&gt;  . I spent quite some time today searching the net for info on carbon fiber materials. Amazingly enough, quite some people in the states make racing bicycles using these materials  .Prices are quite elevated: $5+ for a yard of carbon fiber cloth about 6 inches wide ... Plus the materials you need to do the job (epoxy et al). Phew ! No wonder they charge so much for stuf made by CF ... I intend to try locating such stuf in my country. i would like to build things from it. A small car chasis would be one, for sure, but that would cost quite a bit. hmmm... Let's see ... Errr... nope, can't calculate how much. over &euro; 2k5 (that's $3k) for sure ...
