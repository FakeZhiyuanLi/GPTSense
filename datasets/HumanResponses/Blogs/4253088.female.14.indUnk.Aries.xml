      i hate being sick.  especially in the summer.  being sick in the summer is like... going to school on a saturday.  so basically the last 24 hours of my life have been spent with karly as we moped around and complained about how sick we are.  we also cooked.  which is probably not a good idea because all of our germs are probably lurking around in the food.  we made these lemon cookies which turned out excellent and attempted to make kettle corn.  bad bad bad idea.  who knew that sugar burned when you put it on the hot stove?!  we obviously didnt and you can pretty much guess what happened.  well now im off to be depressed and contaminate another box of kleenexs.  but dont feel sorry for me as im sure you have your own problems.

      greetings from the girl who has everything wrong with her. my head hurts, my left leg is going to fall off, this room is far too hot, and i just spent all my money. i hope you are having a better day than me.  last night was fun though.  lauren and amanda came over and we watched school of rock for like the 4732920958549393385474th time.  then we ordered pizza and sang loudly to mcs and then we had a bonfire.  awesome.  and then this morning i woke early and went to the farmers market.  its a fun place but rather weird.  a clown and 2 mimes in one place was far too much for me to handle.  after this i went to the  mall and bought a few shirts and a new pair of sauconys.  i got to eat at kokomos which is about my favorite place ever.  and i met up with lauren there and it was splendid.  so now i am just home complaining.  i have no other plans for the rest of the evening.  i hope i get to see open water soon.  it looks fantastic.  im also rather curious as to how they make a whole movie of them bobbing around in the water.  if anybody has seen it, tell me if you liked it.  goodnight boys and girls

      friday was one of the better days of my week, any day with karly and lauren is guarenteed (spelling...?) to be a good one.   i recieved a phone call at my house at.. oh say 1? asking if i want to go to laurens with karly and of course haley.  so we watch this mk and a movie New York Minute.  i'll admit... liked it.  i mean, you cannot deny the fact that everybody loves a pathetic, cheesy, sappy mary kate and ashley movie. so after the movie we (alex, the afid, karly, lauren, me) get all  dressed up to go to this Mancinis restraunt where Bill works.  and according to him its very very fancy.  so we show up to this place wearing skirts and dresses while everybody else is wearing jeans.  yes, we attracted a lot of stares that night and realized that Bill is truely a complete and total liar... but we kind of already knew that.  so anyways this restraunt sucked in the first place... there was like 3 options and all were like 15 dollars.  in a situation like that you just gotta go for the kids menu.  and then mr mancini gave us a free cake, it even came with a candle.  wow.  so after this very pleasent experience we looked at various stores such as kohls and target just to kill time.  then back to laurens to find that all the diet coke was gone.  so of course we have to sneak down to the gas station in the middle of the night.  after we retrieved the pop we experienced the highlight of my night.  we watched some orca movie until 3 something.  that movie was absolutely fantastic.  theres these 2 orcas and one gets shot with this like harpoon thing and its  all freakin out so it smashes its face into the propellor trying to kill itself and then it does and they haul it onto the boat and its baby pops out and the dad orca just starts like screaming and growling and spazing out and they let the dead orca go and then the dad orca pushes the dead mommy orca to the shore and then it like attacks this town... and well i dont want to give any more away! but this movie was absoultely amazing.  who knew AMC had good movies on at 2 in the morning?  well i do now and so do you! then sleep, and a rude awaking by paige the girl lauren babysits and then we remember we have a guitar lesson and i guess that was okay and i feel awful after taking laurens benedryll or whatever that expired 6 years ago and now i will just shut up before i bore you to tears.  have a good remainder to your day- K to the F

      thursday is both my favorite and least favorite day.  i start babysitting at 8:30 and am miserable until... 2:00!!! it means i get to go home... also with 3 crisp clean 20 dollar bills in my pocket.  ( and to clear this up.. no i dont get paid 10 dollars an hour, it is also for tuesday unfortunately ) then i go home and eat lunch and think about how i am going to use this new fortune. hmm.. i could go to a movie, go out to eat, buy something, or just keep it and think about how rich i am. option D happens rarely tho.  now im off to do nothing. i hope you have a wonderful day. and also please pray for my computer... i think it is ill.  signing off- kristen song of the day: playing for keeps by matchbook romance, yes the amazing band karly lauren amanda and i shall see rocking out on october 1st

      today i spent the day with lauren.. oh i am soo happy she is home! we had a fantabulous day. we tried pilates. yeah that was pretty freakin hilarious. after awhile i was pretty sick of pulling my naval to my spine and pulling my head up as if someone had a string attached to it. then we enjoyed a salad lunch of rotting lettuce and vegetables and other expired things. then we took shots of diet coke out of the new i love NY shot glass. we also baked peanut butter cookies.. we forgot several of them in the oven while we were vacuuming the stairs and doing other various tasks to prepare for the selling of the house. the rest of the evening involved food, amanda, and the olympics. sweet. tomorrow is back to babysitting and then hopefully a good afternoon. until then- kristen

      yes.. i am a murderer.  well i didnt exactly do the actaual murdering but i feel fully responsible for the death of a young mouse. as i arrived at the house that i babysit at every tues. and thurs. i see an adorable little mouse moving very slowly around the driveway.  in my excitment i walked into the house and said "guess what! theres a baby mouse on the driveway!" the dad shook his head and said "another one? i guess i have to go kill that one too.. it will be the fourth." -sigh- its all my fault. im not quite sure of his methods of destruction, nor do i want to know. but yes babysitting ruined my day.. the kids watched like 15minutes of a movie and i swear, the girl knew every single word said.  it was extremely obnoxious but i have to admit.. i was impressed. on the agenda for the rest of the day- nothing.  lauren comes home today tho. so thats exciting, but other than that.. nothing.  hope your day is going better than mine. love and such, kristen  oh and karly if your reading this, im wearing your the academy shirt.. i hope you dont mind.  and the blasted somerset shirt is still at my house.  you had the chance to take it and you didnt so dont get all on my back about it.. and the gray shorts are here too.  SONG OF THE DAY: when your around oh boy mcs rocks my world

      hello all and welcome to my blog. today i had a splendid day with the one and only karly. we got up early so she could go to her doctors appt. which turned out to be a rather amusing experience. then i went to my aunts school to set up some stuff for her new classroom. i could never be a teacher, too much socializing. all i got accomplished there was writing down kids names on a birthday chart. then i got some dairy queen... the buffalo chicken strip basket ...mmmmmm... then back to karlys for some grocery store action and major nothing doing. then we went to good old Selmas for a waffle cone. other than the eating part, nothing else worth our time there. now im home and testin out the new blog. until i blog again, nothing but love. xoxo K Fed
