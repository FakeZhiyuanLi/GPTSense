       Okay... perfect example of why plastic surgery is ridiculous... Lil' Kim.  What the hell is she thinking?   urlLink Go here  and see for yourself how horrid she looks.  All I can remember is how cute she was when she first hit the scene...the Queen Bee isn't lookin to "Queeny" these days...

        So today on the radio they were discussing how young black females (ages 10 and above) are turning to dieting and plastic surgery at alarming rates!  They asked the question why.  I mean look at MTV's, "I Want a Famous Face" and "Extreme Makeover" on ABC and we wonder why young women don't appreciate their natural beauty?!?!?!  It is so sad that our society creates these false perceptions that skinny, big breasted, and light skinned or damn near white is the only way a person can be considered "beautiful".  It is one thing to diet for health reasons, but if you are a size 6 trying to get to a size 2... kinda makes me wonder!!  Try embracing your natural beauty, inner and outer, before subjecting your body to that much pain!  Love yourself :)

       Random thought for the morning:  Why don't people man up and handle their responsibilities?  You make a mistake (everyone does) or do something you  KNOW  you have no business doing, then you need to face the consequences... stop punking out!!!!!!

       Hmmm okay it's official.  People think they can talk to others any kind of way.  What happened to the idea of actually  being polite and respectful ?  Example.  I went out on Friday only to be yelled at from across the street... "Hey dere... I know you hear me... you think your too cute for me?"  No I just think, rather I know, I am worth more than some random guy yelling at me from across the street like a fool!  Next to the women.  Can't leave yall out.  Women need to learn how to carry themselves with class and dignity.  There is nothing wrong with drinking, but when you are out in public why are you getting tore up?  Not cute.  Do that at home in the privacy of your home with your girls.  Example.  This Friday some drunk chick, came over to me and said some interesting things about my chest.  Then reached out and grabbed... yes she grabbed my breast.  All I could do is stand there in disbelief that this broad touched me.  So ladies, do not let yourself get that out of control that you go grabbing on women or men... it's just not safe.

       Yes the day has finallly come.  After three years of having my own apartment, the princess is moving back home with the Queen.  Don't get me wrong, I love my mom to death, but there is nothing like being able to walk around your house buck-ed naked and doing whateva u like.  But hey, this is what I have to do in order to save up and get that house that I want :).  Guess you have to sacrifice to get what you want sometimes.  Oh well.  Updates for the week... Going to Miami in August with L-Boogie... Canada for my girl Cesi's wedding memorial weekend... Indiana to visit lil brother at school...

       Okay I was listening to Janet Jackson's album last night...it is kind of strange.  I mean I love her to death and think she is a great singer and she is beautiful, but some of the song were odd.  Let me know what you think...  Riding in my car to work, I always have a good mix CD to listen to or I listen to the various morning shows.  I hate it when people stare at me and smile when im grooving.  I mean damn, can I sing and dance in the privacy of my car?  My windows are tinted but people be breaking their necks to watch me.  Am I that beautiful that you want to stare at me?  I think not!  Stop being so damn nosey lol.  If you say you are going to call someone back, call them back or simply say, I will talk to you later.  How hard is that????  Packing is awful, someone save me please!!!!!!!!!!

       Friendship is a give/take, 50-50 relationship...much like a marriage.  One cannot call the other a friend if they are not willing to put out, just as much as they take from the relationship.  While it is not easy to be someone's friend, how come it is so easy to sell a friend out for personal gain?  Well I guess they were never a friend in the first place.  Word of advice and you know who you are:  You can only take so much before I can not afford or want to give anymore.  Are you that unhappy that you are on a mission to make those around you, that care about you, and have been there for you, just as miserable.  I guess they were right when they said, "misery loves company".  I refuse to be your company!  So if sh**ing on me makes you feel like a  MAN , by all means please do so, b/c I am  WOMAN  enough to know that karma is a bitch and it  WILL  bite you in the ass.  More importantly, the man upstairs does not take kindly to messing with one of his sheep... watch out.  So I will take myself out of the equation let you continue to be the MAN you profess to be... it is so official, I'm  DONE !    And this time i mean it!

       The move is done!  I have to say that I actually had fun, thanks to my wonderful friends!  Why am I still tired though?!?!  Oh well, now school.  If i have to write another 20 page paper I will scream!  Teachers no good and well that they don't want to read all that, then why do they subject us to such assignments?  Makes absolutely no sense to me at all.   Nothing profound to say today... sorry... I'm too tired to think lmao. TTFN...Tah tah for now :)

       First of all let me start off by saying being educated does not necessarily mean going to school.  My father, God rest his soul, only had his HS diploma before being shipped off to Vietnam and later losing two of his brothers, being the only one to come back.  Despite his lack of "education" my father is probably one of the wisest men that I will ever know.  Interestingly enough, my mother has a BA and an MA.  I think it's funny when people say I want someone who at least has a BA.  I mean I understand that you want to be w/someone on your "level" so to speak, b/c I do too, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to have a degree saying that I'm smart lol.  My mother and father had a beautiful marriage and spoke the same language... they loved each other.  Isn't that what is most important???  True, love is not enough to make a relationship work.  Respect, honesty, communcation... are just a few things that make a relationship work.  Through my experiences I have learned a lot about myself and the type of "men" I have been with and I can honestly say I know what I want... someone like my daddy ;).    Someone who isn't afraid to love and be loved...  Someone who is honest with me and THEIRSELVES...  Someone who is the man they proclaim to be and want to be... Someone who can support me and let me support them...  Someone who will ultimately love me for me and not try to change me.  So don't say I'm bitter when you say you "love me"... love ain't enough unless you can back it up with some actions.  I'm just sick of these half steppers.  Don't come at me, unless you can come correct... you should only expect the best from me and you should only want to give me the best as well ;)  The love of a friend is something that stands the test of time.  (Side note:  I may yell at you and we may not speak all the time, but I really do love you.  I know I give you a hard time, but you are my best friend... butthead/bubblehead u know who you are... I'm sorry for being such a biotch somtimes! )  So it boils down to this... I would rather have the love of my friends than have the half ass "love" from some wannabe.

       As time goes on, things start to become clearer.  I never used to believe my mom when she would tell me that with time, I would being to notice things and start to see patterns and really get the hang of being a black woman.  I have finally began to believe her.  I am writing a paper for my Business of Public Opinion and Propaganda class discussion how propaganda effects black women in the workforce.  There are so many stereotypes and generalizations made about black women that we must face on a daily basis.  Now I find myself wondering what people see me as... not that it bothers me, I just find it funny.  Do they assume I have a child or that I'm "fast" or better yet lazy and incompetent.  The sad thing is we have to deal with this crap not only from other races, but from our own people as well... especially black men.  I don't know how many times I have heard a black man refer to a black woman as a bitch.  Why is that when a black woman states her mind and puts her foot down... she's a bitch?  Or when you see a women scantily clad, she's a bitch or a hoar?  News flash, black men have created these images!  Look at music videos and movies... yall did it, you and the white man!  So you have no right to call women out of name for the simple fact you all have made women THINK they have to be this way to make YALL happy.  I am so sick of black men being so contradicting.  Yall say you want a nice wholesome girl, but when ur at the club, yall are chasing around the girls with no clothes on... and when you leave, u and ur friends are calling her a hoar.  Go figure.

       Okay so it has been a while since my last posting.  So yes I am on cloud 9.  I haven't been this high... on life that is, in a minute lol.  I mean what bothers me is that everyone assumes that I am happy b/c I got some a$$... I mean why does it always have to be about sex?  B/c it's really not.  How come I can't just be happy?  Oh well... get your mind out of the gutter!  Wanna give a shout out to my best buddy Larissa... congrats on the upcoming graduation this weekend!  We are going to turn NYC out... you know how us BIT's roll ;).  Thought of the day:  People can be so strange sometimes.  Like keep it real.  I hate it when people beat around the bush.  Say what you have to say, stop tryin to be so "mysterious".  Quite frankly it's annoying!

        Have you ever had so many great ideas floating around in your head at once, yet don't know where to begin?  If so, you will know how I feel right now.  Some people mistake this for me being ditzy, which yeah I guess I can be sometimes.    I hate for my mind to not be stimulated.  With school being out for the summer, I know that there is the potential for my mind to become lazy for three months.  So in order to keep things flowing, I am really trying to stay stimulated.  I have now joined a group called "Celebrating Change" which is the volunteer network of the DC Rape Crisis Center which is in charge of organizing and executing the fundraising events.  I am really looking forward to working with this group.  I am also starting to hunt, once again, for a progressive, fairly YOUNG graduate chapter.  If anyone has any suggestions please help me out ;).  So the main goal for the summer is to stay focused on my goals, aspirations and dreams, not to get discouraged and have some fun.  Wish me luck.

Anyways, nothing new or random to report today I guess.  Got a lot of interesting feedback about my "high maintenance" post.  I guess I pushed some buttons... well GOOD lol.  And yes I got my nails and feet done yesterday and my hair is today.  I am looking forward to this vacation... then Miami is next. Don't miss me too much... I will be back soon...

       So I found a great deal on a Dell computer.  When I got to work to get ready to order it, I wanted to make sure it was really what I wanted.  To my surprise I found an even better deal...which in actuality sounded way too good to be true.  So I called the good people at Dell and to the employee's disbelief he was like you are right, but that shouldn't be there... he put me on "hold".  He really transfered me to some random persons voicemail.  Frustrated I called back and had to go through everything again.  This time, the Dell employee thought I was an idiot.  So I took him step by step through the links I clicked on the website in order to find the price I came across.  "Oh wow", he said, "you found a mistake on the website".  He put me on hold, for real this time, and told me to get a cup of coffee while he talked to his supervisor.  He promised me he wouldn't "transfer" me to some random voicemail.  So he comes back to tell me that it was their HUGE mistake and that they had to honor what I saw.  So in essence I am getting a $1000 computer for half of that.  How often does that happen?  Thank you Dell! ;)

       Please help me understand something.  I am sick of people saying I am high maintenance without knowing the true meaning behind it.  Just because I get my hair and nails done every two weeks like clockwork doesn't mean I'm high maintenance, it simply means I'm well kept and take pride in my appearance.  Just because I like nice things, does not mean I am high maintenance, it simply means I am spoiled lol.  (Don't get it twisted, I might be spoiled, but I am not a spoiled brat).   So what does it mean to be high maintenance?  I think it's kind of an empty phrase.  Simply put, I just have high expectations.  I find that when guys tell me I am high maintenance, it is because they can not live up to my high expectations.  And you know what, I don't even think my expectations are high, everyone should look for the qualities that I want in a mate.  -Honesty -Integrity -Sense of humor -Family oriented -Career and goal minded -Sensitive -Attractive (in every sense of the word:  mind , body, and soul) -Understanding -Classy -Humbleness -Confidence ...The list goes on and on.  Quite frankly if you don't have these qualities, why would I even want you as a friend?  We need to stop being so shallow and realize being FINE doesn't mean anything.  You can be the finest negro around, but have no morals or values... Why would I take you home to meet my mother? Answer: I wouldn't.  The few men who have been able to fulfill these qualities, never called me high maintenance... Rather just a  princess .  Which leads me to this.  Being a princess is not a negative thing nor do I think I am better than everyone else.  Growing up my father and mother called me a princess and treated me like I was the princess of the household.  Black women are a blessing (black men are as well).  Black men need to stop disrespecting black women AND themselves and realize that good black women will only take but so much.  R. Kelly said it right...   "Cuz when a woman's fed up (No matter how you beg, no) It ain't nothing you can do about it (Nothing you can do about it) It's like running out of love (No matter what you say, no) And then it's too late to talk about it Too late to talk about it) La da da da da la la da da La da da da da la la da da"  Etc.  We are all princesses, we just need to start acting like it.  So, stop calling me high maintenance... I am a princess  damn it!  ;)

       Today everyone is up in arms about the remarks Bill Cosby made about blacks in our day in age and how they are not honoring those before us who fought for our rights to have access to all public institutions.    Read the Washington Post article... the first by  urlLink Colbert King  and the second by  urlLink Richard Leiby .  What is the big deal?  Okay maybe it wasn't the time or the place but he said what we have been saying for years.  Why are we coming down so hard on Bill Cosby just because he has the balls to come outta his mouth and speak the truth.  Taking away all of the unnecessary off color remarks, his message spoke the truth, that is why everyone is having such a big problem with it.  There is nothing to be embarassed about in terms of him speaking the truth, we should, however, be embarassed about what the truth  IS !

         So yeah my weekend was interesting to say the least.  A lot has been going on in my life these past couple of days.  When I thought things couldn't get worse... they did.    First my computer crashes for good this time.  It won't even start windows up and I can't even boot from the restore CD's.  People stay away from Hewlett-Packards.  They are pieces of $hit.    I did have a ball at my girl Simones annual Memorial Day shin-dig... but woke up with a killer hangover the next day.  Stay away from pineapples soaked in Malibu... they will sneak up on you ;)  But on the real, I had a great time, it was cool seeing some fellow UVa alumni :).    So after the hangover came the cold/allergies.  Having to breathe out of your mouth for a whole day is not cool.  I tried everything.  Sitting in a bathroom full of steam (didn't do anything but make my hair flat... boooooooooooo), hot tea in 90 degree weather (yuck).... finally I resorted to my Allegra and Benadryl... definitely not the safest combo, but it knocked me out!    So I wake up this morning and I can breathe.  No more hangover.  The sun is shining and I got a great deal on a Dell computer.  Tell me why I found a mistake on the website so they had to honor it anyway.  Turns out that I am getting a $1000 computer for $600.  Talk about a wonderful way to wake up.  Thank you Lord for another day... now I know that it can really always be worse.  PS- The cicadas have hit Centreville.  Someone save me!

      Like I mentioned before, I went to Canada last Thursday for my friend's wedding, which was great!  So yall know I have a lot to talk about.  First off.  The customs agents.  So we are on the train on our way up to Montreal when we arrive at the US/Canadian border.  Me and L-Boogie are busy chatting, eating, chillin... just enjoying ourselves, when the train suddenly stops.  Over the loudspeaker, one of the Amtrak employees announces that the customs agents would be boarding the train to check our traveling documents.  Fine.  Why did these fools bumrush the train like the freakin mafia?!?!?  The doors opened and in rushed like 15 people in these dark uniforms lol, talkin about don't leave your seats and have your identification ready--mad stank.  They were checking behind luggage and in the bathrooms, I guess for people lol.  So we are like WTF!!!  So they get to us and this evil looking man says all happily, "Bonjour", "Why are you coming to Canada?" ,etc.  I was so done.  It was the wierdest experience.  There were like 5 agents in our train car.  Some were searching peoples stuff, others were talkin to people on the walkie talkies, one guy told two people to follow him... where they went, I have no clue lol.  It was such an odd experience.  Neverless it took forever, made us 30 min. late getting into Montreal.  It was so tense, I was scared to talk and I had to forget about going to the bathroom... I had to pee so bad.  Finally they left and everyone was kind of just looking at each other like what just happened.  Weird Canadian experiences, part one... part two soon to follow.

       Okay I am really random.  I swear my mind wanders from one thing to the next in a matter of seconds.  Yall should see my desk.  I have post it notes ALL over my cubicle- on my computer screen, drawers, telephone-everywhere.  For instance, I was talkin to my friend and all of a sudden I was like I wanna go to Vegas for the 4th of July and low and behold I think I am going.  Ummmm maybe that's not random just impulsive...  Just now I can think of a rack of things I was just thinking about:    -The metro ride home -I wanna go out tonight (why on a tues. I don't know) -T need to get my nails done -Can't forget my hair appt. on thursday -What am i gonna wear to work tomorrow    I swear I can't keep up with myself.  I feel sorry for you men out there... I'll give you a run for your money ;) (not literally lol)

        Okay how is this for embarassing.  So I am leaving the restroom today only to discover you can see clear through my off white linen pants.  So someone walking behind me will see quite clearly my VS panties that read "think pink" all over my rear.  I pray the metro ride home is uneventful.  The last thing I want is someone pointing this out for me, in public.  (Sylvia, thanx for the heads up girl lol).

       Well since my car is a piece of junk and a gas guzzler, I have given up my $120 parking spot at work and am now taking the metro yet again.  As much as I hate the close, cramped, quarters of the metro, it is the best alternative.  I just hate riding the metro on the way home.  I always have to stand... usually smashed up against someone who doesn't know the meaning of deodorant.  And by the time, there are seats available, I am at my stop... the last stop.    So yesterday, I was going to sit down in a seat, then this MAN bumrushes me and takes the seat.  Then he looks at me and was like "Oh, did you want to sit here?"  I just looked at him and shook my head and walked to the other end of the train.  Men, if you see a woman waiting for a seat ASK her first if she wants to sit down, it is only polite.

       It's official, I  HATE  my car.  No I don't dislike it, or despise it,  I HATE IT .  It's a piece of crap!!!!  It is probably the worst purchase I have ever made.  Once again, for like the third time in a six month period, it is in the shop for a bad thermostat totaling close to $100.  Mind you, I just put in a new battery last week, for.... you guessed it, another $100.  Every time I look at " Goldie " I want to take a baseball bat and destroy her.  That would give me such pleasure.  My once beloved car is the source of my "bitchiness" and stress related headaches.  It's like I get in the car and wonder... hmmm what light is going to blink on my dashboard today?  Or what awful sound will come out of this thing?  So now, I am looking for another car.  No more will I buy used cars, I am so through.  If you have any suggestions on cute, sporty, "girl" cars, please throw them my way.  At this point, I'll take what I can get.  So far this is what I have compiled:  Toyota Solara or Corolla Honda Accord Coupe VW Passat, Beetle, or Jetta  I am not really thrilled with any of these, but they are the most practical.   No more gas guzzlers til I am married with 5 kids to tote around... that is a promise!

      Well what has happened in these past couple of weeks.  Let's just say I am sooooooooooo HAPPY!  I haven't felt like this in a LONG time.  Thank you (you know who you are).  I guess the newest thing is that I am moving, probably to Alexandria.  Other than that... nothing really :).  I'll write more later.  Still floating on cloud 9 :)

      Yes yet again I am floating on Cloud 9.  I think I am finally at that age where I value relationships and really put effort into them.  Being able to click with someone who actually understands you is a wonderful thing and just makes me so happy.  Relationships are more than the romanticezed images we grow up seeing in the media.  They are hard work and are about COMMUNICATION and TRUST.  To say that you trust someone is a huge thing and no relationship whether romantic or platonic can survive without turst.    I am floating along through the weeks, just feeling so carefree.  Like everything can be going wrong, but knowing that that one person feels me and understands me, makes it all better.  Kind of funny how these things work out...  We can learn so much from each other if we just SHUT UP and listen for a change.

        Why does looking for a place suck?!?!  First of all, pictures are deceiving.  These people who list their apartments in these Apartment Showcase type booklets, should be ashamed of theirselves.  The photos, prices and descriptions never match up with what you actually see.  It is amazing how the grimiest place can look so nice with some sunlight and some flowers.  Secondly, why do the "leasing consultants" act like they are trying to sell you a car?  If I say I am looking for something in a particular and you don't have it, why are you trying to make me want something else?  Example:  I called one place and listened to this chicks terrible script reading, only to discover they didn't have any 2 bedrooms.  Why did she try to get me to want a 1 bedroom?!?!  Like the two are comparable at all!  Dummies!  So please wish me and my future roommate luck in finding something by this weekend.  B/C this is worse than trying to buy a freakin' car!

That is the sample used in the new Jadakiss song "By Your Side" which is a great song.  Talkin' about how no matter what, I'll be by your side.  Check it out.  A matter of fact, check out the whole CD it's hot :).

       For those who know me well, know that it takes a lot for me to speak up in certain situations.  Usually in situations that may turn into a misunderstandings.  But it makes things so much easier when both parties involved can act like grown adults and voice their opinions and come to a COMPROMISE.  What a novel concept.  Those who don't know me, may be shocked to know that I find it hard to verbally voice my opinion when it comes to asserting myself.  But it is the case.  I consider myself to be a pretty outgoing person but when it comes to a one-on-one encounter especially when someone I care about is involved, I tend to clam up :(.  The older one becomes, one would think, having a civilized conversation wouldn't be hard.  But I guess I am still scorned by these uncivilized conversations of the past, which in turn make it harder for me to even attempt to embark on conversations of this sort now.  So when I finally do get the nerve up to say something, it is such a relief to feel comfortable and that what I have to say is important.  Hopefully with time, I will continue to voice my opinion and put my foot down when it comes to my emotional well being and happiness.

       So here I am today, in a pissy mood.&nbsp; I wake up this morning with cramps and moving is driving me crazy.&nbsp; Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I get a phone call that there is a delivery for me at the front desk.&nbsp; Hmmm what could they be.&nbsp; All I could think about is what did these people send me now.&nbsp; So I walk up there to discover a beautiful arangement of sunflowers, yellow tulips and lillies.... for moi :) from my pookie.    &nbsp;  Just when I needed to smile he came through as usual.&nbsp; It's amazing how the little things can really brighten your day.    &nbsp;  Thank you sweetie for making my day that much better :)

      Thanks to the help of my wonderful pookie my move went very well yesterday except for the random thunderstorms that lasted for about 20 minutes at a time.  There are still a few more things I need to purchase from IKEA but I guess there is no rush on that.  So of course it's now time to unpack, which wouldn't be so bad if we had cable.  The cable people didn't show up last night so now we gotta wait for them tonight.  The place is very spacious and cute and SOOOOOOO much closer to civilization, which is definitely a plus.  So back to unpacking for me :).
