      Wow I love this song..it reminds me of someone which I wont tell who hehe but you should download this song.. its beautiful.                    The band: Switchfoot                   The song: "Im on Fire"   Here are the lyrics..even those are gorgeous  "On Fire"  They tell you where you need to go They tell you when you'll need to leave They tell you what you need to know They tell you who you need to be  But everything inside you knows There's more than what you've heard There's so much more than empty conversations Filled with empty words  And you're on fire When He's near you You're on fire When He speaks You're on fire Burning at these mysteries  Give me one more time around Give me one more chance to see Give me everything You are Give me one more chance to be... (near You)  Cause everything inside me looks like Everything I hate You are the hope I have for change You are the only chance I'll take  When I'm on fire When You're near me I'm on fire When You speak And I'm on fire Burning at these mysteries These mysteries...  I'm standing on the edge of me [x3] I'm standing on the edge of everything I've ever been before. And i've been standing on the edge of me Standing on the edge  And I'm on fire When You're near me I'm on fire When You speak (Yea) I'm on fire Burning at these mysteries... these mysteries... these mysteries Ah you're the mystery You're the mystery

       Today:  I feel like being alone lately..not for any depressed reasons..just not to be tied to the chats and gossips of so many. Theres a time in your life when you find it unhealthy to indugle in all of that that means nothing. There is also a time when you wish others not to induldge in your life and that is exactly how I feel at this time. You wish you would have never shared that piece of you to anyone because now it is able to be re-opened again and again.  There is also that time when you do not want others to interpret how you feel and tell you when you sit knowing they could never understand. You need to deal with all of it yourself and have the time to self analyze it all. Thats the only way you could really fix it...clamly sitting down and analyzing it yourself and within fixing it all. You are your own therapy.     Well I guess I could consider all that writting I did my own therapy. Even if no one reads it, even understands, or cares.hehe. well let me fill you in on a really good calming song by sugarcult. Eventhough they are punk-rock, I have discovered a song of theirs that isnt.  This song describes much of how I am feeling lately....   Some lyrics from:    "Back to California"   by:   Sugarcult    How long I’ll wait Just to say goodbye Ten different ways to enjoy this night Can’t do this anymore Won’t feel you anymore  Leaving all the fights and all  Summer’s getting colder Drive all night to hold you tight Back to California Days went by We waited and I guess we’re getting older We couldn’t win in the end  You’re gone I’m miles away Turning out your lights Ten different ways I couldn’t miss light Can’t do this anymore Won’t feel you anymore..

       Hey finally this thingy got fixed.  Well wow mucho has happened since the last time I updated this. Lets see many good things..even some bad things.. but they have all turned out ok.  Well I have a lot going now with my music which is where I am focusing all of my energy now. I have many things to send, practice, and etc. Today: I chilled with Manny and joe and then with cristy.  The day seemed to go very well but this night brought feelings and energy I wish i didnt have again. But now I think venting with this journal will bring me to peace.              My ongoing thought:   who can you consider you friend? I mean I have been to and from so many people and even though I have good friends now theres still that whole.. what if they arent who i think they are? It has happened to many too many times already that I feel I cant use the word "friend" anymore. I am now on the edge with certain people and in full swing with others...in terms of friendships. All I know is that I will count on me and those who stick through the ride with any mishaps.                   Favorite band:   Switchfoot                                                 ..their music is so inspirational..                                                                                                               well laterz y'all,                                                                                                                              ::star::

       Hey peoples ...well todays been very chill but I got a couple of future insights...a response from the record label and my room card for school. So everythings cool. wellz..ive decided this year to put all those who are haters in the very unimportant category and go on with my life and not answer to any of their stupid remarks in an attempt to start a fight. Im not proud of the fact that many people either dont like me or bicker with me but I know that I try to be a genuine person and if I do clash with people theres not much a single person can do to try to make peace.so that is that.... like I was saying I feel like this years gonna be cool and im excited.    Creative moment:   yesterday I decorated my binder and it turned out cools.hehe.  :D    Hot Item I want:   Check out this awesome necklace I wish I could buy. but its a bit expensive.                             urlLink  http://www.whitetrashcharms.com/flying_v.html    These lyrics are actually a mix between my own and ashlee simpsons cause I wanted to create how I felt using both songs.    Todays lyrics:   Now I have slowly released the feelings That had once been left to drive me to the edge Oh my life is good And the past is in the past....    Words to think about:     Inspiration  -something that stimulates the human mind to creative thought or to the making of art.   Hope - a feeling that something desirable is likely to happen.                                 ::::Live life and dont let others try to live it for you:::                                                                                               till next time yours truly,                                                                                                                karina

      Hey y'allz..its friday but hey no big difference when you got every day off anyways. But today was still chilling and real low-key.   My guiltiest moment of the day:  recording The Assistant just to see the episode of "cluster fuck" when ever I want. i love that show hehe.  anyway...song that I have been playing out..."its been a while" by stained. This actually has no real reason to be my song of the moment except for the fact that its kinda an "oldie" and I like it.   My funniest moment of the day:  I was just laying back with my head reaching the floor of my room and my body on the bed and I was looking in my mirror singing to 'pieces of me' and I lost my balance and did a back flip.lol. Beside the fact that it did a number on my neck it was really funny and unexpected.hehe..  ...well enough of my "strange" day lol..time for my lyrics of the day... these I actually wrote myself.  These lyrics relate to one particular moment of today..its deeper than you think and it has nothing to do with anyone that would ever read this...or that would ever go on 'aim'.  ========================= I dont want to tell you I dont want to hurt you So I will deal with it I will hold onlet the rain represent my tears I will let this song fade the pain =========================  well till tomorrows my ...oh lets say 2 people who read this lol...   'cluster fuck'   *teehee*     copyright info:   I actually have no interest what so ever in what anyone think of the lyrics I write..so if you chose to comment just know "I dont give a shit" and also dont use my words in an away message..or in any publishing form. (yes it has happened before)   Sincerely yours,   ::star::        -expression in written form says more than any person could ever speak in words-

       Wednesday  was very cools..i got many sexy jeans/pants/skirts for school hehe. Then I went out to eat and chilled with fam..always fun.    Thursday:  Well judging by the weather outside it doesnt seem to be an action filled day..but so far its been cool...just chillin and anticipating the great things that lay ahead for me. I am real excited for one particular thing..but that everyone will just have to wait and see. Next I am excited to start school and finally have the year I want.. with my extra determination and support group guiding me.                                         I sense good things...cant wait for the ride           Favorite band/song now:     "I dare you to move"   by:   switchfoot          Everyone's here     Everyone's here     Everybody's watching you now     Everybody waits for you now     What happens next?     I dare you to move     I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor     I dare you to move--                                                                                                               ::star::

      Wow what a day was  Monday.. lets just say I had nothing to write about it because it was too much of a whirlwind.  Tuesday:  Like I said change isnt easy but this change is getting more and more better to adjust to. Its always good to let go of the negative energy from your life and stick only to the more positive. I have learned that you come in contact with people and once you learn that they wont do anything but bring out the worst in you, not be anything positive in your life and only cause drama..what good are they? Its better to let go of them before it gets worse. Throughout these two days, as fast as it seems, I have uncovered the worse and best in people..and have discovered who truly are my friends. Well all I can say is that I have listened to my heart and trusted my instincts in order to separate the problem causers to the friends  (I know I have made the right choice).      Words to think about:      Friend:   somebody who has a close personal relationship of mutual affection and trust with another.    Hate:   dislike somebody or something intensely: to dislike somebody or something intensely, often in a way that evokes feelings of anger, hostility, or animosity.   - Strong words that should only be used towards those who deserve them. -

       Today:  its been a really good day spiritually wise. I havent been stressed or upset and I find this sheer happiness to be so great. The turn-around? I guess you can say a bit of separation. Sometimes a disconnection goes a long way. Now I wonder if I will add the cause of this back into the routine. I guess you can say it used to be for the better but now I find it unhealthy... but then again it may be hard to detach. Change isnt always easy.   Todays Lyrics  (hehe):   "Who I am"   by:   Smile Empty Soul        And all the miles away I feel a part of me I have to fight Buried somewhere deep beneath my skin The emptiness in me is faded And I can see my life is waiting Now I know I’m living for who I am
