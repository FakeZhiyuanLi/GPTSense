      Why can we be good friends but never get along Why do we fight but know what were fighting over  I really do care about you but sometimes I wonder if you feel the same You seem like you hate me just by the things you say  I dont understand why you get so mad what did i say to set you off Can I say something else to make this all better  Why must you think i dont care and leave me alone to wonder I just keep thinking to myself Why is it always like this

      My questions have needs they need to be answered Many people may say they know but the true answer they do not hold  I know you think you have the answer but how can we know without the sorce This is something that means so much to me so it hurts to not know  One day maybe my questions will be answered and I will know for sure But know it is time to ask myself Will I ever know?

      Most people think the best day is a sunny day but not me, i belive the best is a cloudy day.  What good comes  from a sunny day It only makes you want another one  What good is going throught you life wanting sunny days When you can just realize the others are just as good  Sure you can go out side as much as youd like But you can listing to the rain and enjoy the day  Sunny days drive me insane because evryone likes them so much Why cant we all be strange and like the stormy ones

      I stare at the stars  but they hold no answers I pray to the heavens but they dont answer my prayers  I look to see what lay beyond but all i see is darkness Something is blocking my view so i cant see what i should do  I dont know how i am supposd to feel im not sure i want to This makes me so confuesd not knowing what to do  Im scared ill mess this up because i dont understand what to do But from everything you've told me  neither do you.  &nbsp;

      What if you had a second chance  so you could change the way it was  What if you could always change your mind  so everything went your way  &nbsp;  What if you could go back in time  so you can saver another minute  What if you could grant a wish  so you could make someone else happy  &nbsp;  What if you could die today  so you could let another live&nbsp; What if you&nbsp;could tell the one you love how much you love them &nbsp;  Would You?

      If i was walking through the world and i could not see a thing Would you be there to hold my hand and be my eyes so i could see it all?  If i was walking through the world and i could not hear a thing Would you be there and be my ears so i could hear it all?  If i was walking through the world and i could not say a thing Would you be my mouth and say it all so everyone would know?  If i walking through the world alone and i had no way to turn Would you be there to let me in and keep me safe from harm?
