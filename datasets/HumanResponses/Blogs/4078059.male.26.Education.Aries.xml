      Hello Blogging world!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, this is my fist blog, but I've got a lot to say.&nbsp; You don't have to like it, hell you don't even have to read.&nbsp; But, hey, your deal.&nbsp; I guess I need to just rant for a bit and say what the fuck is up with this country?!&nbsp; Look at what's going on here, Iraq is a big kick in the teeth for everyone involved.&nbsp; Bush is a jackass who rushed in without any kind of a plan as to what he was going to do after we "shocked and awed" (Shock and Awe?!!&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; What is he five?) Iraq.&nbsp; They were clearly neither.&nbsp; However, now that we're there, what are we going to do about it?&nbsp; I don't have any idea.&nbsp; It's all fine and good to say we should have never have gone, yadda yadda yadda.&nbsp; I don't care, get your head out of your ass.&nbsp; Now we need to figure out what the hell is going on.&nbsp; Bush doesn't know.&nbsp; He's a moron.&nbsp; I can't wait to get his goofy ass out of office.&nbsp; Just so everybody knows, we have a drunken idiot whose playing cowboy in the Whitehouse.&nbsp; Not like Kerry is all that much better.&nbsp; He has the personality of my ass.&nbsp; Well, my ass actually has a Godlike glow around it (note- radiation will  not  make you an X Man), so excuse that last bit.&nbsp; Seriously though, Kerry is a rock with lips, but I'm hoping he'll be a SIGNIFICANTLY smaller threat to the security of this country than Bush.&nbsp; I know there's going to be tons of people who disagree with me, and I respect your right to be wrong, but you can't look at the way things are going and conclude that Bush is doing a good job.&nbsp; Unless you work for Calliburton.&nbsp; With this election coming up, I'm hoping we don't take one up the ass, but with the way the Republican party steals elections (note- the electoral college can kiss my ass.&nbsp; what a freaking joke that is.) I'm thinking we'd better start stretching now.&nbsp; Just ask President Gore.&nbsp; Okay America, take it all take it deep.

      Okay, I'm in the mood to philosophize (as our friends Bill and Ted would say). I was reading Keats  Ode to melancholy  the other day and began to toss around a few ideas that are bugging me. Okay, hang with me here. We cannot know joy without pain, true? Kind of like a yin and yang thing. How would we know what light is if we haven't experienced darkness? Same thing with joy and pain.  Now, here we go, the greater depths of pain you have experienced the greater the ability to experience joy. So, following this logic, you cannot increase the level of joy you are capable of experiencing without knowing its antithesis, therefore we must not shy away from pain.  Keats calls for us to avoid the perils of alcohol lest they numb us to pain. I look at this, and consider the desensitizing youth of today. Many people blame video games, television, film, music, etc. For desensitizing our youth towards violence and helping to facilitate events like Columbine, but I believe that perhaps it is this tendency to self medicate and suppress pain that is leading us to become numb. By not allowing ourselves to experience pain, either physical or emotional, we cut ourselves off from the ability to experience joy. Now, to further confuse myself, I also understand the human minds ability to create its own constructs in regards to memory, so perhaps it is also important to not push painful  memories  down. We need to be able to look back on painful events in our lives and accept the pain that flows from these wounds. If we ignore past wounds, we cannot experience future joy.  Alright,  BIG DISCLAIMER HERE,  I am not masochist, and I do not enjoy pain. I don't even want to begin to explore where all of  that  would fit in to this argument. I also am not calling for people to  seek out  pain. I merely wish to encourage people not to numb the pain that comes along naturally,  within reason . Seriously folks, don't get a root canal without novacain, but also don't pop a handful of tylenol everything you bump your knee either, and don't ignore anger, depression, or a broken heart. Accept these things, embrace them, and realize that only through experiencing them can you allow yourself the possibility of happiness.  Okay, I'm giving myself a headache here. Drop me a line and let me know what you think about all of this.
