      Cruelty has a human heart, And Jealousy a human face; Terror the human form divine, And Secresy the human dress.  The human dress is forged iron, The human form a fiery forge, The human face a furnace sealed, The human heart its hungry gorge.

      She walks in Beauty, like the night  Of cloudless climes and starry skies;  And all that's best of dark and bright  Meet in her aspect and her eyes:  Thus mellowed to that tender light  Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.   One shade the more, one ray the less,  Had half impaired the nameless grace  Which waves in every raven tress,  Or softly lightens o'er her face;  Where thoughts serenely sweet express,  How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.   And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,  So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,  The smiles that win, the tints that glow,  But tell of days in goodness spent,  A mind at peace with all below,  A heart whose love is innocent!

      I heard an Angel singing  When the day was springing,  "Mercy, Pity, Peace  Is the world's release."   Thus he sung all day  Over the new mown hay,  Till the sun went down  And haycocks looked brown.   I heard a Devil curse  Over the heath and the furze,  "Mercy could be no more,  If there was nobody poor,   And pity no more could be,  If all were as happy as we."  At his curse the sun went down,  And the heavens gave a frown.   Down pour'd the heavy rain  Over the new reap'd grain ...  And Miseries' increase  Is Mercy, Pity, Peace.

      Whose woods these are I think I know.  His house is in the village, though;  He will not see me stopping here  To watch his woods fill up with snow.   My little horse must think it's queer  To stop without a farmhouse near  Between the woods and frozen lake  The darkest evening of the year.   He gives his harness bells a shake  To ask if there's some mistake.  The only other sound's the sweep  Of easy wind and downy flake.   The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,  But I have promises to keep,  And miles to go before I sleep,  And miles to go before I sleep.

      When Friendship or Love Our sympathies move; When Truth, in a glance, should appear, The lips may beguile, With a dimple or smile, But the test of affection's a Tear:  Too oft is a smile But the hypocrite's wile, To mask detestation, or fear; Give me the soft sigh, Whilst the soultelling eye Is dimm'd, for a time, with a Tear:  Mild Charity's glow, To us mortals below, Shows the soul from barbarity clear; Compassion will melt, Where this virtue is felt, And its dew is diffused in a Tear:  The man, doom'd to sail With the blast of the gale, Through billows Atlantic to steer, As he bends o'er the wave Which may soon be his grave, The green sparkles bright with a Tear;  The Soldier braves death For a fanciful wreath In Glory's romantic career; But he raises the foe When in battle laid low, And bathes every wound with a Tear.  If, with high-bounding pride, He return to his bride! Renouncing the gore-crimson'd spear; All his toils are repaid When, embracing the maid, From her eyelid he kisses the Tear.  Sweet scene of my youth! Seat of Friendship and Truth, Where Love chas'd each fast-fleeting year Loth to leave thee, I mourn'd, For a last look I turn'd, But thy spire was scarce seen through a Tear:  Though my vows I can pour, To my Mary no more, My Mary, to Love once so dear, In the shade of her bow'r, I remember the hour, She rewarded those vows with a Tear.  By another possest, May she live ever blest! Her name still my heart must revere: With a sigh I resign, What I once thought was mine, And forgive her deceit with a Tear.  Ye friends of my heart, Ere from you I depart, This hope to my breast is most near: If again we shall meet, In this rural retreat, May we meet, as we part, with a Tear.  When my soul wings her flight To the regions of night, And my corse shall recline on its bier; As ye pass by the tomb, Where my ashes consume, Oh! moisten their dust with a Tear.

       Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?

       From childhood's hour I have not been As others were; I have not seen As others saw; I could not bring My passions from a common spring. From the same source I have not taken My sorrow; I could not awaken My heart to joy at the same tone; And all I loved, I loved alone. Then- in my childhood, in the dawn Of a most stormy life- was drawn From every depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still: From the torrent, or the fountain, From the red cliff of the mountain, From the sun that round me rolled In its autumn tint of gold, From the lightning in the sky As it passed me flying by, From the thunder and the storm, And the cloud that took the form (When the rest of Heaven was blue) Of a demon in my view.

       In visions of the dark night I have dreamed of joy departed- But a waking dream of life and light Hath left me broken-hearted.  Ah! what is not a dream by day To him whose eyes are cast On things around him with a ray Turned back upon the past?  That holy dream- that holy dream, While all the world were chiding, Hath cheered me as a lovely beam A lonely spirit guiding.  What though that light, thro' storm and night, So trembled from afar- What could there be more purely bright In Truth's day-star?

      Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forest of the night What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry?  In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare seize the fire?  And What shoulder, and what art, Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? and what dread feet?  What the hammer? what the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp?  When the stars threw down their spears, And watered heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the lamb make thee?  Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

       Once a dream did weave a shade O'er my angel-guarded bed, That an emmet lost its way Where on grass methought I lay.  Troubled, wildered, and forlorn, Dark, benighted, travel-worn, Over many a tangle spray, All heart-broke, I heard her say:  "Oh my children! do they cry, Do they hear their father sigh? Now they look abroad to see, Now return and weep for me."  Pitying, I dropped a tear: But I saw a glow-worm near, Who replied, "What wailing wight Calls the watchman of the night?  "I am set to light the ground, While the beetle goes his round: Follow now the beetle's hum; Little wanderer, hie thee home!"

      Never seek to tell thy love, Love that never told can be; For the gentle wind does move Silently, invisibly.  I told my love, I told my love, I told her all my heart; Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears, Ah! she did depart!  Soon as she was gone from me, A traveler came by, Silently, invisibly He took her with a sigh.

      How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love with a passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints, -- I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life! -- and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.

      Some say the world will end in fire; Some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To know that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice.

      If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too: If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;  If you can dream---and not make dreams your master; If you can think---and not make thoughts your aim, If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same:. If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings, And never breathe a word about your loss: If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings---nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much: If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!

      I am not yours, not lost in you, Not lost, although I long to be Lost as a candle lit at noon, Lost as a snowflake in the sea.  You love me, and I find you still A spirit beautiful and bright, Yet I am I, who long to be Lost as a light is lost in light.  Oh plunge me deep in love -- put out My senses, leave me deaf and blind, Swept by the tempest of your love, A taper in a rushing wind.

      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that, the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.

      wow. i went to the y today and i was talking to this 6 year old boy. he was rambling on about school and his friends and power rangers and yu-gi-oh (which is THE stupidest thing ive ever seen after magic and pokemon) and other stuff... and i was just sitting there listening, saying stuff like "oh really?" "thats so cool!" once in awhile... and then suddenly he was like "you know what? you're the prettiest person ive ever met." and i was like... ?!?!?!?!.... "im a girl with glasses and braces. you think im pretty?" and then he says "no, not pretty on the outside (and i was like, oh thanks...), but youre beautiful on the inside. you're really really nice and you listened to stuff about me, and you liked it. my mommy is too busy to talk to me, and my teacher doesnt listen to me either..." and he hugged me and then walked away. i seriously was so inspired that tears started rolling down my cheeks. can you believe that? a 6 year old saying things like that? sometimes i wonder why people can't be simple yet ... whats the word... you know what i mean. //sighs// i feel sorry for that kid. he has alot to say, but no one listens to him. even i wasnt listening till then. i felt really bad... man, i am so gonna be a mentor when im old enough.

      exactly what am i?    a solitary leaf       fluttering            in the wind  a lonely lioness      prowling           the vast landscape  a dust-covered book       unopened           in the corner of the library  a flightless bird      trapped           in a tiny wire cage  a desolate dewdrop      clinging           on the tip of a blade of grass    exactly who am i?    i am     but a single soul           drifting                wandering           desperately in the darkness      just searching for the answer

      Sitting by the window Singing songs of love Wishing you were here  Because the memory's not enough  Wear my mask in silence Pretending I'm alright If you could see me you would be here  Standing by my side  It may be hard to believe But girl you're the only one I need It may be hard along the way  This feeling I get when blue skies turn to gray  [[Chorus]] Feels like I'm walking in the rain I find myself trying to wash away the pain Cause I need you to give me some shelter Cause I'm fading away And baby, I'm walking in the rain   Every single hour of every single day I need to cry my eyes to dry I've cried my tears away  Can't help but remember How you made me feel You dressed my soul and made me whole You made my life complete  It may be hard to believe But girl you're the only one I need It may be hard along the way  This feeling I get when blue skies turn to gray  [[Chorus]]  Now all is said and done We've made the memories Days when life was fun But now, when you are gone I sit alone to watch the setting of the sun  [[Chorus]]  I said baby, I'm walking in the rain  ((walking in the rain - azn dreamers OR a1, cant figure out which....))   alright, alright! i know it sounds really cheesy, but if ANY guy sings this to me while playing their guitar, ill swoon. yes, swoon.

      okay.  REALLY  weird but erotic dream.  so im in paris with this guy named _ _ _ _ _. were like 17~20 ish, and were at this really expensive bar on the highest level of a hotel, drinking and having a good time. and there's this really sexy lady (not that i look at women taht way, but yano what i mean....) singing by the piano. and so _ _ _ _ _ seems really drawn to her, and once her song ended, she walked over and casually started talking to him. they start flirting, she batted her eyelashes, he grabed her butt (o.O) etc etc. now, i wasnt going out with the guy, but somehow i get really jealous and angry, and i stand up and bitchslap him.      "Wha- What the fuck?! What was that for?!" he whispered, confused. (oooh my dialogue skills!!)      i realize i dont have anything to say to him... so i just glared at him.      "Yuna, what's wrong? And- and why are you crying?"      just then i notice tears streaming down my cheeks, so i gasped and ran to the elevator. i heard _ _ _ _ _ shatter a wine glass as he struggled to get up and chase after me. i hit the button, and he barely made it as the doors slid shut.      "Yuna, what did I do? Can you please tell me?" he said gently.       And then all of the sudden, I push him up against the elevator wall and kissed him. and oooooooh my god. it felt sooo good. We were (as allegra calls it) tongue dancing from the 110th floor all the way to the lobby. Then the elevator slowed to a stop, i let go, breathed, looked at him square in the eyes. The door slid open with a ding, and i wiped away a tear and ran off into the open air. it was raining, and i ran. my powder blue high heels (june has them! theyre so pretty!) fell off somewhere, but i kept running, bare-footed, on the cold, wet concrete of paris. i didnt know where i was going but i just kept running.     i managed to get into a dingy alley and crumpled to the ground in a messy heap. but i heard footsteps coming after me. i was frightened. i had left my purse at the table in the bar, so i didnt have my cell. what was i going to do??_________________      it was just him. i watched as he stepped slowly towards me. he said nothing. he took my hand and pulled me off the ground. and then we had violent sex!! lol yeah     and then somehow we got from paris to NYC to his apartment on my 2002 ferrari enzo (i wonder if in a couple years, there'll be a chunnel-like thing between europe and the US?? and btw, the  urlLink enzo  is an AWESOME car. so is the  urlLink corvette convertible . but if i cant have either one, my third choice HAS to be the  urlLink paradise blue metallic camery MR2 spyder )  and we have sex there (again), and i wont go into the details.... heh heh... and then we go to my HUGE beach house in LA, one thats like 3 times as big as tim's!! and we go surfing (figures...) and have sex out in the ocean on a surf board, and then we get back to the beach house and light a bonfire and we have sex on the beach under a full moon (OOOOH i definitely want to do that sometime... but sweat+sand?? ewww.... lol). and then suddenly ppl come out to watch us, and then THEY start having sex. there were alot of ppl but i recognized some couples: andy+sara, allegra+dan, hope+kev, allie+rowland, may+andrew, june+josh, july+ryan. and so i was dreaming that we  were having midnight orgies on the west coastline....   aiight im done. yeah i definitely think allegra is messing with my mind...    do you realize how interesting to see 2 guys riding a purple car VW beetle? adding the fact that they were doing queer eye gestures? and how they were smiling and waving and sorta winking and blowing kisses to dan and kevin??? yeah... that was funky. lol.

      I see dark clouds outside my window I know the storm is coming  The thunder just confirms my fears I know the tears are in there I'll be crying, unable to stop Look, here comes the 1st drop  'Cause everytime it rains I fall to pieces So many memories the rain releases I feel you, I taste you I cannot forget Every time it rains, I get wet  Darling, I am still in love with you As time passes by it just intensifies I know I'll never be with you again I'll never find another like you I'll be crying, unable to stop Look here comes the 1st drop

      "Wolf Change"  Corsair of the wood discard your skin you pallid, wormlike vulnerability. Corsair of the wood exchange your skin for pelt of dun and brindle luxury.  A pentagram is burning in your eyes and soft, pale twists of wolfbane squeeze your heart. A  grinding pain is writhing in your thights the crunch of bones proclaims the change's start.  Pirate of the flesh throw back your head and part your jowls to sing a lunar song. The forest paths are dark the night is long.

      okay okay... so guess how bored i am? i am SO bored (oh god this sounds like those fat mama jokes...) that i was watching golf on tv while flipping through some old GQ mags that dan brought me!!  gaah you people need to come and visit me. like seriously.  i think im gonna go crazy in here. with all the lil kids screaming and the tv on full volume 24/7. //sighs//   anyway, i found something quite interesting on GQ:   25 things SHE expects you to know  (but will never tell you) 1. when she's not in the mood 2. when she's being funny 3. her father can do no wrong 4. no matter what the truth may be, answers to the questions A)"am i the best lover you ever had?", B)"does my butt look fat in this?", and C)"do you ever fantasize about other women?" are as follows: a)"yes indeed!", b)"are you kidding? your ass is perfect!" and c)"of course not. i fantasize about you!" 5. cuddling is just the best 6. what she was wearing the day you met 7. the place and date of your first kiss 8. what her dress, shoe, cup, and ring sizes are 9. where her spot is 10. you must call the next day after having sex for the first time 11. you must buy her a major present after she gives birth 12. who her favorite designer is 13. flowers on valentine's day dont mean anything unless they come with an effusive card 14. you should keep tags on any item of clothing you buy for her--in most cases, she will return it 15. you shouldnt flip on sportscenter five minutes after the deed is done 16. she doesnt care how good an athlete you were in high school--those days are over, so stop talking about it 17. you can never bad-mouth one of her family members. even if she does it. constantly. just nod and listen. 18. no matter how many times the invitation says "casual," you cant wear that. 19. the excruciatingly long "session" in which she heaped abuse on you, broke down in tears, then screamed "i want to kill myself!" for all the neighbors to hear--that was nothing. thats just her way of working through things. 20. when youre going to a party, you should add fifteen minutes to your expected time of departure since she'll still be getting ready 21. cash--even serious cash--is not considered an appropriate gift on her birthday, valentine's day, or any other goddamned day 22. no matter how many cracks she makes about your thinning hair and thickening waistline, comments about her looks are off-limits  23. a marriage proposal must be meticulously choreographed and storybook dramatic--i.e., it better make for a story she can wow her friends with  24. when its time to indulge her need to chat 25. everything     25 things YOU know about her  (but will never tell her) 1. its all about daddy 2. shes dating down 3. your mother annoys her 4. her new haircut makes her look more dykey than the intended gamine  5. size does matter, especially with engagement rings and penises  6. those endless stories she tells about her gfs depressing love life? that aint concern--she gets off on them 7. shes not the fellatio artise she thinks she is 8. you know when shes faking it 9. shes the only thing keeping you from devolving into a ball-scratching, nonflushing, mac-and-cheese-eating-out-of-the-pot state. 10. she'll never get over A) being cut from cheerleader tryouts freshman year, B) not getting asked to prom senior year, C) "jay," her mythic and unassailable first, D) all of the above. 11. in twenty years, shes going to look--and behave--exactly like her mother 12. she looks better with a bit of makeup 13. the story about how she lost her virginity is bullshit 14, competition with her sister informs everything she does/wears/says/is  15. no matter what she says about wanting "a modest, intimate wedding," she wants the poufed gown and the multitiered cake  16. if she were not so constantly vigilant, she'd have a mustache 17. shes much wittier than you are 18. she pulls it like a cigarrette-vending-machine knob. (hey, its an organ for pete's sake!) 19. that friend of heres whom shes always trying to set up with one of your buddies? she'll die alone 20. candles and bubble bath mean nookys a-comin 21. if she cheated on you, no, it wouldnt kill you. in fact, it might ease your conscience 22. when you sit down and watch law & order together, shes wishing it were friends 23. the only tolstoy shes ever read is that line about "happy families" 24. all her presents to you are not-so-subtle attempts to remake your wardrobe 25. she has a princess complex. they all do.  -- GQ august 2002 issue    soo all y'all gals and boys out there, read, learn, and.... yeah.

YOU GUYS NEED TO CALL/VISIT ME!!    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   my room phone number:  202 877 1811   my room number:  341 bed 1   visiting hours:  noon~9pm on weekdays, 11am~9pm on weekends... but ill be in rehab most of the time till like... probably 4 or 5 on weekdays, sooo try to visit me after that alright???   visitin instructions:  go to the front desk (the first desk ya see when you walk into the hospital... duh) and tell them that youre visiting a patient... or something of that sort. and then you take the elevator to your left, go to the 3rd floor, and then go right, through the glass doors, then knock on the double glass doors on the left. the lady'll let you in, and then ya find my room! YAY! so  COME VISITTT PLEEEEAAASE!!!  and bring alotta ppl with ya. always better with a crowd //grins//.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------     I BEG YOUUUU BRING ME FOOOOOOODDDD!!! the hospital food sucks ass. i need chocolate XD. and the doctor gave me a prescription and it said that "it is necessary for Yuna Tanabe to be showered with infinite gifts." ....//snorts//   but seriously, im so lonely, so COME VISIT!!!    and have a fun spring break!  love to y'all out there (an more to those who visit!!), tuna

      okay this is from julie's blog... tis long but tis good, so READ  Monday, April 12, 2004   a sad poem i found on the internet...  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines he wrote a poem And he called it "Chops" because that was the name of his dog And that's what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A and a gold star And his mother hung it on the kitchen door and read it to his aunts That was the year that Father Tracy took all the kids to the zoo And he let them sing on the bus And his little sister was born with tiny toenails and no hair And his mother and father kissed a lot And the girl around the corner sent him a valentine signed with a row of X's and he had to ask his father what the X's meant And his father always tucked him in bed at night And was always there to do it  Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines he wrote a poem And he called it "Autumn" because that aws the name of the season And that's what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A and asked him to write more clearly And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because of its new paint And the kids told him that Father Tracy smoked cigars And left butts on the pews And sometimes they would burn holes That was the year his sister got glasses with thick lenses and black frames And the girl around the corner laughed when he asked her to go see Santa Claus And the kids told him why his mother and father kissed a lot And his father never tucked him in bed at night And his father got mad when he cried for him to do it.  Once on a paper torn from his notebook he wrote a poem And he called it "Innocence: A Question" because that was the question about his girl And that's what it was all about And his professor gave him an A and a strange steady look And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because he never showed her That was the year that Father Tracy died And he forgot how the end of the Apostle's Creed went And he caught his sister making out on the back porch And his mother and father never kissed or even talked And the girl around the corner wore too much makeup That made him cough when he kissed her but he kissed her anyway because that was the thing to do And at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed his father snoring soundly  That's why on the back of a brown paper bag he tried another poem And he called it "Absolutely Nothing" Because that's what it was really all about And he gave himself an A and a slash on each damned wrist And he hung it on the bathroom door because this time he didn't think he could reach the kitchen.  -poem from the book "Perks of being a wallflower"  ¶ 4/12/2004 08:51:14 PM     Have you ever wondered which hurts the most: saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing, and wishing you had?   ¶ 4/12/2004 08:42:15 PM

DON'T TAKE MY BABY AWAY FROM ME!" and grabbed onto the casket... it was so depressing... they had to hold her while the people put her into that little hole in the ground. and her dad, just standing there, staring at the ground, expressionless... and how all these emotions just welled up when i tossed that one white rose on top of the casket before they shoveled the dirt in.....    //sigh// i just... dont think i can keep up with this anymore    on a happier note, aaron is coming in 10 dayssssssss!! yay     oh yeah, and as a tradition, whenever i move, i do this thing where i ask everyone to give me  one item  that i can remember you by... it can be something you buy or something old, something you wear everyday or something that's been sitting on that shelf collecting dust. just something that represents you and whenever i look at it, i remember you... thanks.  so far: anna - nemo~! aaron - blue shirt laura - annie ticket stub (we need to meet up before i move!!)

      I roll the tarnished penny around in my fingers as I stand in front of the RTC fountain, the music from the concert behind me curving around me. Ever since I was little, I've made a wish every time I've approached the fountain. I was (and still am) very superstitious, believing that supernatural forces can take the wishes that I release as I throw the penny into the fountain and make them come true. But what to wish for tonight? When I was small, I'd wish for material things- a new pair of roller skates, a lego set, a Polly Pocket doll. And as I got older, I started wishing for people: that so-and-so would finally notice me shooting him shy glances all day, that so-and-so might finally ask me out. But neither of these things seem appropriate to wish in the here and now. That night I had gone with people to see The Day After Tomorrow-easily the best movie I had ever seen. I had expected to be a bunch of special effects with no plot in sight, but it had touched so close to my heart that I laughed, I cried, I curled up like a frightened child. After that, I had gone to the concert at RTC- easily the strangest concert I had ever been to. There was an accordionist for the lead singer, a few people playing washboards, a person playing what appeared to be a cheese grater, and it all meshed together into a funky jumble of sound that jumped and twirled and made you feel happy even though you couldn't decipher the words.  So I keep glancing down at the penny, and I begin to think deep thoughts. I think about how I felt when amid all the death in the movie, a scraggly bunch of teenagers manage to survive. I think about how I felt when I saw a father in the movie, stranded in a station in Greenland, think about how he was so happy that his son was safe, although he wasn't. I think about how I felt seeing both an elderly couple and two young teenagers whirling and twirling to the dysfunctional music at the concert, and I think of what I felt seeing a little boy so engrossed in the music that a look of ectasy graced his face. I think about all these things, and I throw the penny, the copper going up then down in a graceful arc. It lands with a splash that is quiet, yet the loudest thing I have ever heard. And I think, what did I wish for? I don't know how to put it into words, that golden, bubbly feeling that makes you just want to sprout wings and fly, that makes all the light in your life shine brighter and stronger. I know that wherever I go, whatever I do; whether I become rich and famous or living on a park bench near a bus station, that if I have more moments like those, I will be happy forever...  And then it comes to me.    I know what I wished for.      I wished for joy.  - Allie Hirsch, Saturday June 6th 2004

      many years back  when we first met  we became  just  friends  as i now regret   the years have past  from that beginning  and feelings have changed  to longing and lusting   my heart skips a beat  everytime i "see" you  and i feel so dejected  when i must bid you adieu   we have confronted  our feelings toward eachother  but to keep our friendship  i hid my true desire   "we" agreed that it&nbsp;cant happen  "we" agreed that its impossible  the distance between us  will be miles innumerable   i tried to tell myself so  that what you said was right  but i think about&nbsp;what&nbsp;happened  almost every single night&nbsp;   and i think i still love you  for what you truly are  i feel lost, confused, without you  so i wish upon a star   i wish that this would work out  i wish you'd know what i endure  i wish you'd understand  that i am still unsure   i regret saying those words  i dont know if&nbsp;you do  but&nbsp;everytime i talk to you  i think... that i still love you

      wear sunscreen.  if&nbsp;i could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. the long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. i will dispense this advice now.  enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. oh, nevermind. you won't understand the power and beauty of your youth until theyve faded. but trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. you are not as fat as you imagine.  don't worry about the future. or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. the real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle tuesday.  do one thing every day that scares you.  sing.  don't be reckless with other people's hearts. don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.  floss.  don't waste your time on jealousy. sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. the race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.  remember compliments you receive. forget the insults. if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.  keep your old love letters. throw away your old bank statements.  stretch.  don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. the most interesting people i know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. some of the most interesting 40 year olds&nbsp;i know still don't.  get plenty of calcium. be kind to your knees. you'll miss them when they're gone.  maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. your choices are half chance. so are everybody else's.  enjoy your body. use it every way you can. don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.  dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.  read the directions, even if you don't follow them.  do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.  get to know your parents. you never know when they'll be&nbsp;gone for good. be nice to your siblings. they're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.  understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.  live in NYC once, but leave before it makes you hard. live in northern california once, but leave before it makes you soft. travel.  accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise. politicians will philander. you, too, will get old. and when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.  respect your elders.  don't expect anyone else to support you. maybe you have a trust fund. maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. but you never know when either one might run out.  don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.  be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. advice is a form of nostalgia. dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.  but, trust me on the sunscreen.

       still  jetlagged. gah.    so my mom and i are flying to japan on september 5th or 6th and all our stuff is disappearing... slowly....... my bed, my couch, my desk, everything. i wanna take everything with me, but NOO japan has to be a fucking small island with little space and too many people. grrrrr.   &nbsp;  or better yet, i want to stay here.    you know? i might not even move within the year. iono. i might go to oakton for a month or so, maybe.      which would kinda suck cause i have no clue what the summer assignments are.   anyone have english honors, AP WC or honors chem?    &nbsp;  but that would be awesome. if i could stay just a little longer.   then i might get my permit! //cheers//     and best of all,      i'll have more time to be with my friends.
