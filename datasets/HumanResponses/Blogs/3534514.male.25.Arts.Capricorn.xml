        (image from  urlLink  http://global.yesasia.com/en/index.aspx )  Top stars Gigi Leung and F4's Ken Zhu are romantically entangled in "Sky of Love"!  One fine day Yan Xiao Jia (Gigi Leung) coincidentally stumbles over a walkie-talkie, which gets her connected with Jia Hui (Ken Zhu). As luck would have it they both study at the same university and try to make an appointment. However every time something else prevents them from meeting in person. Therefore, they fall into the habit of keeping in contact with their walkie-talkies and end up becoming close friends via extensive verbal communications.  Artist Names:  Gigi Leung | Ken Zhu Release Date:  February 3, 2004 Duration:  91 Minutes Publisher:  Mei Ah (HK) Director:  Teng Hua Tao  Xiao Jia, a university student, secretly admires her class monitor, Wen Tao. In a twist of an event, Xiao Jia accidentally gets hold of a radiophone. One day, as she daydreams of Wen Tao, the radiophone connects to Jia Hui and they start communicating through the radiophone. From their conversations, they discover that they are actually studying in the same school and plan to meet up, but both of them miss the date and finally find out that they exist in two different worlds.

The film follows Xiao-jai (pop star Gigi Leung) and Wen Tao (F4 pop star Ken Zhu) as they become friends through the course of conversations on a radiophone. Over time, the two fall in love, but are shocked to realize that Wen Tao lives in the future, and that their only physical connection lies in the radiophones. Exploring the idea of loving someone who comes from a completely different life, SKY OF LOVE provides a sweetly romantic drama that capitalizes on the appeal of its stars.  Source:  Yahoo!

As they both communicate thru the radiophone, they discover that they are actually studying in the same university and plan to meet up....   Review:   There I am walking into what is obviously a romance by myself with my 'Kill All Humans' hat on ready to fall asleep after a particularly lethargic day at work. Which is a pretty strong indicator of the strength of the film when I can say Sky of Love is actually worthwhile seeing.  The plot follows two people who live in very different worlds who meet by accident via short wave radio and, with the help of the anonyminity of the medium, reflect upon their experiences of love and fate. Despite what it sounds like, this is no tale of "star crossed lovers" destined for tragedy - if anything, the film maintains a very strange balance between the two leads that keeps the film from devolving into a soppy affirmation upon the "power of love."  Xiao Jia is falling in love as Jia Hui is falling out when they they encounter each other and the relationship that develops sees them in constant contrast to each other such that the ending is both happy and yet tainted with a despairing resignation that makes the resolution somewhat phyrrical.  I am not sure whether it is the strength of the direction and script or just Ken Zhu's charisma but it is really difficult to hate his character, Jia Hui, despite the very despicable nature of the character and his actions as compared to Gigi Leung's much more innocent Xiao Jia. I think it is perhaps I may have more empathy for Jia Hui's stoic cynicism but even I can still see he is a bit of a bastard most of the time.  What the film does suffer from is that it really is quite predictable. I don't think I'd be giving too much away by saying there is a plot twist you can quickly guess at once the the two leads are introduced. It also seems strange that a supposed Hong Kong film is set entirely on the mainland and I do get the impression that the version I saw was a dub from Mandarin but the difference is quite subtle and hardly noticeable if you are focussing on the subtitles. On that point though, there are one or two moments in the film, there is some written information that you just wish they translated but didn't.  Depite this, Sky of Love is really quite enjoyable and would appear to be another chip away at my angry cynical demeanour. Who knows? I might even be considered normal one day....  8 Oracular Short-Waves out of 10  by Eugene Chan   Source:   urlLink http://www.heroic-cinema.com/review.php?ID=skylove   -----   Love HK Film   Ken Chu and Gigi Leung connect Ditto-style in Sky of Love. 	 Year:  2003 		 Director:  Teng Hua-Tao 	  	 Cast:  Gigi Leung Wing-Kei, Ken Chu Hsiao-Ten (Chu Hau-Tin), Tong Dawei (Tung Dai Wai), Tao Hong (To Hung), Liu Zi (Lau Chi) 	 	  The Skinny:   China-HK remake of the Korean film Ditto is as pleasantly told as the original, but it's more ham-handed and strangely enough, lacks heart. Otherwise, it's nearly a shot-by-shot remake. This film can be summed up in one word: unnecessary. 	 	  Review by Kozo:  	       Yet another member of Taiwan boy band juggernaut F4 gets a big screen push in Sky of Love, a conspicously close remake of the 2000 Korean film Ditto. Ken Chu is Jia Hui, a university student in 2003, who gets a ham radio call from Xiao Jia (Gigi Leung), a fellow university student who he assumes lives somewhere nearby. Sadly, he's mistaken. Xiao Jia actually exists in 1981, and their ham radio connection is some amazing cosmic coincidence that allows the two to bicker needlessly and then later compare notes on their respective times. It also allows the two the opportunity to dissect the meaning of love, and how it relates to both of them. Xiao Jia is sweet on her class monitor Wen Tao, while Jia Hui has an obnoxiously pushy girlfriend/nemesis who pesters him constantly. Eventually, lessons are learned and growth is achieved, but not before the big twist which shouldn't be a shock to anyone who saw Ditto.       If you're going to take the time to check out Sky of Love then you should most definitely see Ditto first. At then, after seeing Ditto, you should debate whether or not it's even necessary to check out Sky of Love. The short answer: probably not. Sky of Love, while set in China and possessing of some cultural differences that may make it more accessible to Chinese viewers, is still a total copy of Ditto. Not only was the basic plot lifted, but scenes, plot development and even dialogue are copied wholesale. The big differences: the film is shorter by about 18 minutes, and as such goes by comparatvely quicker. Also, the film ends in a somewhat downbeat manner, whereas Ditto managed to be bittersweet and even touching. Sky of Love also leans a lot more on the present-day romance between Jia Hui and his nutty girlfriend, which could be interesting if you happen to enjoy watching Ken Chu a whole lot more than Gigi Leung. If not, then that's another strike against the movie. If you're counting, that's like strike nine, which means a whole inning in baseball.       Those unfamiliar with the story behind Sky of Love might find some enjoyment in its pleasant, languid storytelling and the tried-and-true buttons pushed by director Teng Hua-Tao. The premise of the film is certainly interesting enough, and the innocence with which love is portrayed is probably made-to-order for some cinema romantics. Those who don't realize that there's a superior picture out there might find Ken Chu's "I am dead inside" performance to be fittingly self-centered, or Gigi Leung's big-eyed sweetness to be affectingly enjoyable.       Then again, Leung isn't really a step up from Ditto's Kim Ha-Neul, and Ken Chu would be smacked around in a charisma competition with Ditto's Yoo Ji-Tae. If anyone reading this review thinks that it's unfair to so soundly trash Sky of Love thanks to the existence of Ditto...well, tough. It's the way of the world; you shouldn't copy someone else and not expect some comparison. As it is, Sky of Love is only recommended for Ditto completists, and there's even a Japanese remake called Scent of Time for those who must see every film with the same ham radio hook. If you're really pushing it, you can see the American film Frequency, which featured a son chatting with his dead father via a ham radio—except they used their powers to fight crime instead of debate the existence of love. Maybe Sky of Love shouldn't have gone so far as to have its protagonists change history, but something to make it different from—or even as good as—Ditto would have been nice. (Kozo 2004) 	 	 Notes:  Sky of Love was sync-shot in Mandarin, so if you watch the film you should make sure NOT to turn on the dubbed Cantonese soundtrack. True, Gigi Leung does handle her voice in both languages, but given the choice, who really wants to hear words that don't match the actors' mouths? Besides employees of Miramax, that is.

Asilo Inquirer News Service    (image from  urlLink  http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/nov/19/ent_3-1.htm )  A NUMBER of movie titles grabbed our attention when we browsed through the entertainment section of the Straits Times on our trip to Singapore last week. The scope and variety were impressive-from contemporary European features and Hollywood popcorn flicks to Asian filmfare (including some vaguely familiar Filipino movies like "Kool Ka Lang").   But knowing how popular the boy group F4 is, one particular movie piqued our curiosity. So, we caught a screening of Johnnie To's "Sky of Love," a Taiwanese romantic drama made significant by the casting of its male lead-"Meteor Garden's" Ken Zhu, in his big-screen feature debut.  If there's one thing we like about Taiwanese movies in general, it's their technical polish and visual pizazz-and To's movie is no exception. Sometimes, its lighting establishes the general mood of a scene, even when there are no words exchanged between characters.   The movie tells the story of two people from different times, 20 years apart, communicating only through a CB radio. If you're not familiar with Hyun-seung Lee's "The Sea" or Gregory Hoblit's "Frequency," the Jeannot Szwarc classic, "Somewhere in Time," demonstrates the same mood.   Wide-eyed optimist Xiao-Jia (Gigi Leung), a third year university student, stumbles across a broken shortwave radio while stealing glances at a handsome man she subsequently falls in love with. But she and her best friend share the same affection for the young man, who seems to reciprocate her feelings.   One night, while fiddling with the broken radio, she ends up talking to Wen Jia-Hui (Ken Zhu), a cynical freshman from the same university. After some easy banter on-air, they decide to meet at the school foyer at 2 p.m. the following day. But they both find themselves stood up by the other-she standing in the blazing heat of the sun for an hour, he in the pouring rain, completely soaked. Of course, they seethe at the inconvenience. We wonder if these characters have ever been introduced to the concept of umbrellas and raincoats, though.   It turns out it was really nobody's fault. She is in the year 1982, he in 2002, and they are simply brought together by the machine that allows them to talk despite the years that separate them. After exchanging caustic remarks, they figure out the situation, but not the reason. (The movie never explains the "mysterious" radio.)   As their friendship grows, so does the attraction between them, as they discuss their lives across 20 years.   Soon, Jia-Hui shares his amusement over the similarity of the names of the man Xiao-Jia is in love with and his father.   But they soon realize that Jia-Hui's mother and father were Xiao-Jia's best friend and true love, respectively. It dawns on Xiao-Jia that the love she has isn't meant to be, and that she will forever be haunted by her ill-fated affection to Jia-Hui's father.   While the movie sometimes meanders into moments of malaise, it nevertheless stands as a winsome, bittersweet romantic drama that could do well at the box office here. The leads don't meet, except in one scene.   Wanting to find out if Xiao-Jia has gotten over her heartbreak 20 years later, Jia-Hui searches for her, then rushes up to the school where the older Xiao-Jia teaches. We don't see her face, but her hunched shoulders speak of loneliness as she walks in the shadows of the school corridor.   Leung gives a remarkable performance as her character journeys from discovering true love and experiencing heartbreak. Zhu, the 24-year-old F4 veteran, truly has a popstar's presence, but doesn't fare as well as Leung.   Zhu isn't bad, but his detached brooding pales beside Leung's heartfelt wistfulness.   The movie tugs at the heartstrings. Filipinos will fall for the film's simple narrative and vivid depiction of a love found and lost.   Just don't expect it to have the emotional, gut-wrenching punch of "The Hours."  -----  I watched this movie fully expecting it to be a complete rip off of the hollywood movie Frequency from a few years ago.. with a love story twist. As I got into the story it became less of an Asian frequency and more of a strange little hybrid of that movie and the amazing Il Mare. Then it changed pace on me once again and turned into something more like Back to the Future. The point of this rambling? This isn't the movie that the box cover would have you expect.  That's a good thing obviously, but it also leads to some of the negative points about the movie. It doesn't flow very well. It has elements of a love story, a thriller and a social commentary but it never really follows any of them through satisfyingly.  Xiao Jia (Gigi Leung of Fat Choi Spirit) attends college in 1981 and has a major crush on Wen Tao who seems to reciprocate her feelings. While playing with a radiophone she begins a conversation with Jia Hui, a student at the same place in the year 2003, and they strike up something of a friendship, confiding in each other about the differences in their societies and their feelings and desires of love.  However things take an unusual twist just as you suspect the two may be falling for each other. I can't say that it was unpredictable and shocking because the twist was always a possibility in a story such as this, but the movie was either intentionally or otherwise filmed to give some red herrings as to how the plot was going to plan out.  The music in this movie is beatiful, the acting is for the most part quite good and the difference between the two decades is striking so credit must be given for style but its the plot that eventually makes this a mixed bag of a movie.  As I said previously it tries to be so many things as a film that it often doesnt tie up things neatly or conveniently. The love story in this movie is for the most part fairly shallow and underdeveloped and actually seem more like schoolgirl crushes than full blown love. The thriller part of this story is a non starter, sometimes the music builds and you wait for something to happen but it never does, and the commentary on the nature of love being the one constant in times and change is very nearly let down by the ending.  Still, underneath the criticisms Sky of Love is a diverting and occassionaly charming movie that is definetley worth taking a look at to decide for yourself but it is no Il Mare.

His applications to other airlines bore no fruit, and faced with impoverishment, he turned his energies elsewhere. He studied nursing and has gotten a placement overseas. Another said he knew someone from a fairly well-off family who was promised by her father a bigger allowance and a second-hand car if she would take up nursing in college. Her father was certain it would bring her a bright future.  Welcome to the brave new world. I still recall the time in the 1960s when rich Filipino families were distinguished by having amahs, or Chinese maids. Now rich Hong Kong families are distinguished by having "Filipinas," which has become synonymous with housemaids. (No, the Oxford Dictionary doesn't say that, contrary to rumor. But that is another story.) I was about to say the day may not be far off when instead of exporting bands to Asia, we would be importing them. But I remembered we had the Taiwanese teen group F4 last year, and we've had karaoke for years now.  -----   urlLink http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/eyeoneastasia/story/0,4395,256312,00.html  The Straits Times June 15, 2004  Chinese mood against Taipei independence growing   Protests against singer A-mei show that Chen Shui-bian's re-election has roused Chinese patriotic feelings, analysts say  By Goh Sui Noi  BEIJING - The student protests against Taiwanese singer Chang Hui-mei's performance in Hangzhou last Saturday indicate that anti- Taiwan independence sentiments among the Chinese are growing stronger, analysts here said.    'The Taiwanese authority's policy, the selling-out of the country by Chen Shui-bian, has violated the traditional Chinese sense of patriotism,' explained cross-strait analyst Zhang Tongxin.  As a result, Chinese nationalism was on the rise and anti-Taiwanese independence sentiments were growing stronger, he said.  Taiwanese President Chen had been provocative, Mr Zhang said, by holding two referendums together with the presidential election in March, and by letting known his intention to revise the Constitution. Beijing saw these as moves towards Taiwan's independence.  Mr Zhang also noted that China's youths were angered by the sale of arms to Taiwan by the US and the suggestion that Taiwan blow up the Three Gorges Dam should China attack the island.  Last Saturday, a protest staged by students at Zhejiang University led to the cancellation of a performance by Taiwanese pop diva Chang Hui-mei, better known as A-mei, for security reasons.  The students carried banners that said: 'We don't welcome Taiwanese artistes who make money on the mainland but support Taiwanese independence.'  These words echoed those of a spokesman for the Cabinet-level Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), who said at a press conference late last month that 'those who come to make money and then go back to support Taiwan independence are not welcome'.  He was referring to Taiwanese businessmen. But soon after the publication of his remarks, as well as a People's Daily article that named Taiwanese tycoon Hsu Wen-long as a pro-independence element, Chinese netizens began urging the boycott of not only Taiwanese businessmen but also artistes.  Lists of supposed pro-independence artistes started circulating on the Internet, and they include big names such as Jay Chou and F4.  A-mei has protested against the boycott, saying that 'I am a singer without any political affiliation'.  She first suffered sanctions by the Chinese government in 2000 after she sang the Taiwanese 'national' anthem at the inauguration of President Chen. She began making a comeback in China about two years ago.  But this time, while the government has not attempted to block her performances here, she was facing protests from the Chinese people.  Mr Li Dongmin of the Social Survey Institute of China thought the students' reaction was to be expected.  People's concern over the cross-strait issue had been greatly aroused during the March 20 Taiwanese presidential election, surveys by his institute have shown, although interest fell slightly last month during the inauguration of Mr Chen.  A higher percentage of respondents also indicated they would not accept Taiwan's independence in a survey after the presidential election, compared with a similar one conducted before the election.  While lauding the Hangzhou students' patriotism, Mr Zhang thought their action was impulsive and irrational.  But he said it was an isolated incident; he feels most Chinese people are rational.  Analysts were not worried by the Taiwanese urging retaliation by boycotting Chinese artistes, maintaining that this would not lead to a deepening of bad blood between the people of the two sides.  TAO spokesman Zhang Mingqing said at a meeting with Taiwanese reporters on Sunday that only a very small number of Taiwanese businessmen would be affected by China's policy targeting pro-independence investors.  Most Taiwanese doing business in China would enjoy the protection of their lawful rights, he added. 	 -----   urlLink http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/jun/07/yehey/enter/20040607ent1.html  Entertainment Monday, June 07, 2004 Star Circle Quest Grand Finals:  Boys’ night out By Irene Ocampo Curtis (excerpts)  After talented beauty Roxanne Guinoo got booted out of the top three, Hero and Sandara stood centerstage, hands clasped, before the former was ultimately pronounced the winner.

And just like in the hearts of Gen Y, Asian pop culture has found a home in a nameless shop located at 849-A Sabino Padilla St. near Ongpin, Sta. Cruz.  CDs and VCDs from China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea are available at almost half their market prices.  It's a haven for anime buffs and Chinovela aficionados. Each title is a friend that you've been looking for all your life but never really found, well, until now.  The store has the limited-edition release of "Spirited Away," by Hayao Miyazaki, winner of 2002 Oscar for Best Animated Feature (the competitors that year included Disney's "Lilo and Stitch").  A wide range of "Ultraman" reincarnations and anime hits such as "Doraemon" are also available.  All the movies of the Chinese stars you know, and the ones you don't, are all there. It's a place where Jacky Chan and Zhang Ziyi rub elbows with the likes of Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng.  Though the shop owners don't play favorites (as they only categorize their wares according to the country of origin), it's obvious their current bestsellers are F4 series like "Meteor Garden," "Poor Prince" and "Love Storm" -- if we gauge it by the sheer volume of covers prominently displayed on the shelves.  Regular movies like "Magic Kitchen" are priced at P150. But there's a catch. It has, like most of the movies in the shop, no English subtitles. For versions of movies with English subs, the price is doubled.  Meanwhile, VCD series like "Lavender" and "Westside Story" are priced at P40 per disc.  What you'd want to hoard from this shop are the cheap audio CDs of pop idols from our neighboring countries. All albums of F4, some not even locally promoted, are practically a steal at P150. The store also carries albums by 5566, Ambrose Hsu (the male protagonist from "Love at the Dolphin Bay" and "Lavender"), WeWe, Comic Boyz and 4 In Love (Rainie, a member of this all-girl band, plays opposite Ken Zhu in "Meteor Garden").  Soundtracks of Korean series like "Endless Love: Autumn's Tale" and "Endless Love: Winter Sonata" are also available.  A word of advice: Prepare the names of the artists or movies you're looking for before you drop by this place. Though there is a Filipino-speaking assistant, you have to deal with a shop owner who doesn't speak Filipino fluently. That's why having a handy list you can present can save you time and energy.  Patience is rewarded in this shop, as a thorough exploration yields discoveries of music videos and albums of movie superstars like Karen Mok and Nicholas Tse.  If you don't have enough money to buy a whole collection, don't fret, as the shop also rents out CDs to its customers at P10 each CD per day. That means you can borrow the whole series of "Lovestorm" for 26 days at P260. However, first-time customers are asked to pay a P300 deposit.  The shop is open from 10:30 a.m.-7:30 p.m., Tuesdays to Sundays.

Date: 12/26/2003 10:55:30 AM Source: The Journal Group By: Itchie Cabayan      The popularity of the Taiwanese boy band F4 has seemingly waned.   Yesterday, the quartet arrived together at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, but the screaming throngs of fans were no longer in sight, despite the promotions regarding the arrival of the singers for a concert tonight at the PSC-Philsports Arena (formerly ULTRA).  Only a handful of media people was at the NAIA to cover the event, as Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou, Vanness Wu and Ken Zhu arrived on board Eva Air Flight 271 from Taipei at around 11:35 a.m.  The reporters and photographers, few as they were, chided the organizers in charge of the F4’s arrival for allegedly rudely shooing them away, denying them the opportunity of taking photos or conducting interviews.  "Laos na nga ’yang F4 na ’yan, pinagyayabang n’yo pa. Kung ’di lang kami inutusang mag-cover dito, hindi naman kami magtitiyagang hintayin ’yan, ’no?" a fuming newshen told the organizers.  The absence of enthusiastic fans, though, pleased airport general manager Edgardo Manda and Gen. Angel Atutubo, chief of the Manila International Airport Authority’s security and emergency services.  Atutubo said the lack of unruly crowds was favorable to the management of the airport since it was a lot easier to maintain orderliness and security measures, a far cry from the previous arrivals of the members of F4 — who also starred in the Taiwanese TV soap opera Meteor Garden — when security personnel found a hard time controlling the fans that flocked to the NAIA to take a glimpse at the quartet.  Unlike the previous arrivals of the F4 members — as well as of their Meteor Garden leading lady Barbie Xu and her sister Dee Xu — yesterday was a different case.  Before, an emergency staircase was immediately attached to the aircraft carrying any of the singers once the plane landed on the tarmac, so he could go straight to a waiting vehicle and avoid the fans.  Yesterday, all four of them alighted at the NAIA along with ordinary passengers and even had to line up with the rest so they could await their turn to pass through the scanning units installed in the concourse area mnd manned by health personnel.  The scanning machines were ordered installed by Manda at the NAIA and the Centennial Terminal 2 to check if the passengers have fever, a primary symptom of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  Once the F4 members had been checked, they entered the dignitaries’ lounge, from where they proceeded to their waiting vehicle.  The reporters noted that the F4 members were consistent in their snubbish ways, not even waving or taking a look at anybody, denying the media the chance to take good photos or interview them.  -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00002568&category=PC  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  Only 9,000 people can watch F4 concert live  December 24, 2003 01:40:00(LA) / 2003-12-24 17:40:00(Manila)  ONLY people carrying tickets worth at least 3,000 pesos will be allowed to watch the Taiwanese quartet F4 perform inside the Philsports Arena in Pasig City on Dec. 26, according to a concert consultant.  Those holding tickets that cost less than 3,000 pesos will have to make do with watching Jerry Yan, Vanness Wu, Vic Zhou and Ken Zhu on a wide screen at the open field outside the arena, said Susan Lim of Big Slim Entertainment.  Contrary to an earlier report, Boy Abunda's Backroom Inc. is not involved in the promotion of the concert. The promoter is Mega Media of Joed Serrano.  The Philsports Arena is usually used during basketball games.  The "F4 Live Happy New Year 2004" was originally set at the Fort open field in Taguig, which can accommodate 30,000. The Philsports Arena (formerly Ultra) has a seating capacity of only 9,000, said Lim.  Tickets to the concert are 20,000 pesos, 15,000 pesos, 10,000 pesos, 8,000 pesos, 7,500 pesos, 5,000 pesos, 3,000 pesos, 2,500 pesos, 1,500 pesos and 600 pesos.  "The Ultra has allowed the use of the football field bleachers to accommodate general admission ticketholders," Lim said on Monday.  Those who wish to get refunds for their tickets can go to any Ticketworld outlets, Lim added.  Chito Cabalu of East West Global Entertainment last Saturday backed out as co-producer of the F4 concert, saying Taiwanese producer DaiBei Productions Inc. failed to come up with the money to finance the show.  Cabalu also said DaiBei Productions failed to get the working permits for the performers and to comply with the security requirements for a show at The Fort.  Lawrence Lo of DaiBei Productions said he was able to secure all the necessary working papers last Monday morning.  "I cannot cancel the show because I've already made a commitment with the F4 and their fans, who will be coming from Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong," said Lo.  Jerry and Vic were guests in the "Happy 50TV" concert of ABS-CBN last Nov. 29, also at the Fort Bonifacio open field. Vanness and Ken performed at the Philsports football field last September.  In their Dec. 26 show, the pop idols from Taiwan will sing their hit singles "Can't Lose You," "Season of Fireworks," and "Can't Help Fallin'" from the phenomenally popular chinovela "Meteor Garden," shown on week nights on ABS-CBN.  "F4 Live! Happy New Year 2004" will be the first time in two years that all four members are performing in one show together. They are expected to arrive in Manila on Christmas Day.

Lo     Are they coming, all four of them, or aren’t they?  As far as the avid fans of Taiwan’s Fab Four – Jerry Yan, Vanness Wu, Ken Zhu and Vic Zhou – are concerned, the question of the hour is not who FPJ’s running-mate would be (is she the one?) but whether or not the F4 (Flower 4) guys are coming for a concert on Dec. 26, Friday (a day after Christmas), or not.  The answer is yes, they’re coming – "Definitely," according to the people behind the much-awaited concert. I’m referring to the Taiwanese producer, DaiBei Productions and its new partner, Susan Lim’s group, which also produced the concert last September starring two of the F4 guys, Ken Zhu and Vanness Wu. A few weeks later, Jerry Yan came to drumbeat for Bench of which he’s a new image model and, again, three weeks later for a concert with Vic Zhou.  Yesterday, The STAR and other papers bannered the "cancellation" of the F4 Dec. 26 concert. It was a misunderstanding resulting from the breaking of ties between DaiBei Productions and East West Global Entertainment (headed by Chito Cabalu) which was behind the recent staging of the Mariah Carey concert and the MTV Summit 2004 both at the Fort Open Field in Taguig City.  East West backed out of the F4 concert after, according to Cabalu, DaiBei Productions failed to comply with certain requirements, including security requirements at the venue, also at The Fort, and the release of a certain amount for the hiring of bodyguards and ushers for the concert, and for the sound system, stage, barricades, chairs and portalets.  That was all that was canceled – the contract between East West and DaiBei, but the concert will go on as scheduled, now with Susan Lim’s group as DaiBei’s new partner.  "The new venue is the PCS Sports Arena (the old ULTRA)," assured somebody from Susan Lim’s group. "Tuloy na tuloy ang concert. Walang atrasan."  It’s the first time all four guys are performing together here, and possibly their last. The F4 fever has reached its peak and I’m sure that after the Dec. 26 concert, their popularity – and novelty – will die down. That’s what happened to Thalia/Marimar a few years ago, remember? The third time Thalia came back, she wasn’t as well-received as she was the first and second time. Well, you know, familiarity breeds...  Still and all, tickets to the F4 Live Happy New Year 2004 concert are selling like low-priced cellphone "loads," with the ones costing P20,000 and P15,000 mostly reserved by about 500 fans from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Indonesia. Other tickets are priced at P10,000, P8,000, P7,500, P5,000, P3,000, P2,500, P1,500 and P600.   -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00002550&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  F4's Dec. 26 show to go on after all  December 23, 2003 02:37:00(LA) / December 23, 2003 18:37:00(Manila)  ONLY people carrying tickets worth 3,000 to 5,000 pesos will be allowed to watch the Taiwanese quartet F4 perform inside the Philsports Arena in Pasig City on Dec. 26, according to a concert consultant.

"I never imagined that Filipinos would find Taiwanese talents more charming than their own," Bob told Inquirer Entertainment two days before he flew to Los Angeles, California, last Nov. 6. He was referring to Vanness Wu and Vic Zhuo, members of the wildly popular Taiwanese boy band F4, or Flower 4, who came to Manila last September to perform to a big crowd at the Ultra football field in Pasig.   "I was shocked when I found out how obsessed Filipinos are with these Taiwanese talents," he added. "I guess Filipinos today have no respect for their own.

The 28-year-old stars in the new idol drama, Love Storm, opposite F4's Vic Zhou and Ken Zhu, as a rich but spoilt teenager.   Ask her why she can still pull off roles 10 years younger than she is, and she clams up defensively.  Failing to see the compliment in the question, her enormous eyes crinkle up and her pixie-face flushes.  Sprawled on a long couch in one of the executive suites at the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel, her petite 43kg, 85cm-57cm-85cm frame slumps into the cushion.  She gazes forlornly at her cute, pointy leather shoes before replying in soft, raspy-voiced Mandarin: 'I'm pretty stressed out and bothered by these questions. Many people in Hong Kong and Taiwan have accused me of trying to act younger and cuter than I am, but I don't.'  Visibly distressed, she takes a few seconds to compose herself.  While acknowledging that her winsome looks have played a part in her success, she stresses that it happened early in her career.  'Yes, I may have been given more opportunities due to my appearance, but in the long term, it's your talent and hard work that counts. I intend to have longevity in my career,' she says.  Hsu's interview, her first promotional work in Singapore, comes on the back of her new album, The Secret To Happiness Is Love.  Released by her new record label, Avex Trax, last month, it hit No. 2 on the Top 10 chart on its debut in Taiwan and sold an incredible 300,000 copies.  Despite her current success, her soft-porn past continues to haunt her.  After splitting from girl-group Shojo-Tai in 1994, the then 18-year-old released a risque pictorial called Angel Heart.  Featuring her in nude and topless shots, sales in Japan hit the 500,000 mark. In Taiwan, it sold 100,000 copies.  Admitting that she lost her youth to showbusiness - she was in Shojo-Tai when she was 15 - she now defines happiness as finding fulfilment in 'making the most of your life, music and career'.  Although she has been linked to plenty of male celebrities - including three members of F4 - she has only made one engagement official, that with Sugizo, the guitarist of defunct Japanese band Luna Sea.  Even though she is rumoured to be dating F4's Vanness Wu, she sounds resolute when she says she has no love life.  'I'm definitely waiting for love to happen. I hope to be married in June 2006. But sometimes, things don't go as planned. If the right man comes along, anything can happen.'  Scrunching up her face, she adds: 'He must really, really love me a lot.'  -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00002202&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  1,000 security men for Ah Si, Lei  November 28, 2003 00:11:00(LA) / November 28, 2003 16:11:00(Manila)  TO PREVENT a repeat of the stampede that happened during the F4 concert last September, nearly 1,000 security personnel, 13 ambulances and five fire trucks will be deployed during the "Happy 50 TV" concert at the Fort open field on Saturday.  The concert will feature Jerry Yan and Vic Zhuo, two of the members of the wildly popular pop quartet. Jerry and Vic, popularly known as Dao Ming Si and Hua Zei Lei of the hit series "Meteor Garden" on ABS-CBN, are the special guests in the network's "Happy 50 TV" concert that will start at 8 p.m. Saturday.  Their "Meteor Garden" costars Vaness Wu (Mei Zuo), Ken Zhu (Xi Men) and Barbie Xu (Shan Cai) performed last September in "The Event" at the Philsports football field in Pasig City, where eight people were injured in a stampede.  Barbie and Dee will join Jerry and Vic at the Fort show Saturday.  A field hospital and 13 medical stations, manned by doctors and other medical personnel from the Department of Health, will be set up at the Fort, according to Cory Vidanes, ABS-CBN senior vice president for TV production.  The increased security for the one-night show is codenamed "Oplan Happy 50 TV," she said.  To secure the perimeter of the venue, about 120 container vans will be set up as a fence around the venue, instead of using galvanized metal sheets like the ones used during American singer Mariah Carey's concert last Nov. 18.  During Mariah's concert, about a hundred fans rushed to the general admission section of the venue, causing the makeshift fence to collapse. No one was reported hurt. For Saturday night, there will be 11 gates. Mariah's show had seven gates.  The gates will be opened to the public as early as 12 noon Saturday. Video and still cameras and tape recorders will be confiscated at the gate, Vidanes told Inquirer Entertainment.  The concert-goers can retrieve their cameras and recorders from depository booths after the show, she added.  Mineral water bottles and soft drink cans will be prohibited inside the venue.  Yan and Zhou will be joined in the Fort show by local stars such as Ai-Ai de las Alas, The Hunks (Piolo Pascual, Jericho Rosales, Diether Ocampo, Carlo Agassi and Bernard Palanca), Vina Morales, Kristine Hermosa, Claudine Barretto, and love teams John Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo, and John Prats and Heart Evangelista.  Star Cinema's blockbuster movie "Ang Tanging Ina" will be shown on the nine video walls at the concert site.  About 60 concessionaires will be selling snacks and refreshments. About 80 portable toilets will also be set up around the concert venue.  Jerry and Vic will arrive in Manila Saturday morning. Barbie and Dee are expected to fly in from Taiwan Friday.  Yan has also been hired by Philippine clothes magnate Ben Chan to be the newest image model of the Bench label. In his native Taiwan, Yan was a part-time commercial model.  Zhou is also known by his Chinese name Zhou Yu Min, or his pet name Zai Zai. At 20, he is considered the baby of F4.  He is the quiet one among the boys of "Meteor Garden" and is actually shy in real life.  Zhou earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the Lotung Industrial and Commercial Vocational High School and is currently attending night classes in business management at the Chung Kuo Institute of Technology.

Orani Posted 13 November 2003 (excerpts)  Did you know that in the past three months, around 100,000 text messages daily have been taking part in the short message service (SMS)-enhanced interactive TV promotions around the TV series Meteor Garden shown on ABS-CBN Channel 2? These text messages include simple registration details to participate in the promo or requests to download logo and picture messages, costing PhP15 each, or color pictures costing PhP20 each.  Interactive TV Pays, Thanks to SMS  Katigbak admitted though that even if SMS or texting is very popular in countries like the Philippines because of the high penetration of mobile phones across all segments of society and in all areas of the country, the success of SMS-enhanced interactive TV promotions still hinges much on the popularity of the TV show.  But in the case of the Taiwan-born TV series, Meteor Garden that has gained millions of loyal viewers in the Philippines since it was started to be shown early this year through ABS-CBN Channel 2, Katigbak said it was only around three months ago that ABS-CBN Interactive was able to introduce SMS-based interactive TV promotions around the top-rated TV show.  Apparently, the license to use Meteor Garden for interactive TV promotions in the Philippines was separate from the license to show that program on TV in the country.  Meteor Garden owes its popularity not just to the refreshing faces of Taiwanese star Barbie Xu and the now famous Asian boy band F4 comprised of Jerry Yan, Vic Zhuo, Vanness Wu, and Ken Zhu, but also to the gripping and fast-paced storyline.  But Meteor Garden has really become that popular in the Philippines, as it had earlier been in other Asian countries where it was first shown (Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand), such that the volume of messages the number 2366 had received in relation to the promo around the TV show and its characters had been consistently around the 100,000 mark each day for the past three months since the promo started.  -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00001837&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  'Meteor Garden' star takes Palace by storm  November 6, 2003 08:27:00(LA) / November 7, 2003 00:27:00(Manila)    (CAPTION: President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Taiwan’s hottest star Jerry Yan Cheng Xua mingle with the cancer-stricken and orphaned children from the Center for Health Improvement and Life Development (CHILD) who were among those who welcomed the Taiwanese member of the popular boy group called F4 upon his arrival this afternoon (November 6) at Malacanang. Malacanang Photo)  HE didn't speak a word; didn't even wave a hand. But his presence had women, gays, matrons and schoolgirls swooning.  Taiwanese pop star Jerry Yan, also known as "Dao Ming Si" from the television soap opera "Meteor Garden," took Malacañang by storm Thursday, stirring a mob never seen since Mexican telenovela star Thalia visited the Palace in the '90s.  "I want to faint," Christine Borja, a Malacañang correspondence writer, gushed. The tall TV star had just held her hand.  "We want his autograph," cousins Bernadette Suva, 9, and Claire Suva, 8, said while waiting for the arrival of the Taiwanese TV star.  Another autograph-seeker was Presidential Spokesperson Ignacio Bunye.  Journalists Aileen Intia of GMA Network radio station dzBB and Celerina del Mundo of Daily Manila Shimbun slipped into the Palace study room for a "scoop" photo opportunity with the visiting pop star, beating the entire Malacañang Press Corps to the draw.  Peering under streaked brown locks, Yan, wearing a black shirt and pants, paid a call on President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo at her den before proceeding to the huge, chandeliered Ceremonial Hall for a traditional photo session with Malacañang officials and employees and their families, and with media.  Among the special guests were five cancer patients from the Philippine General Hospital and 9 children from an orphanage.  "One's not supposed to faint, get thrilled or even get near (the Taiwanese star)," the rules were spelled out by the master of ceremonies in Filipino 30 minutes before Yan's arrival.  "Okay, let's practice," assistant secretary Isabel de Leon announced, as she "choreographed" the sequence of the photo sessions.  A group of Chinese, most of them in black, entered the hall. They were part of Yan's 16-man entourage.  Then, suddenly, it was bedlam.  Yan had entered the hall, with Ms Macapagal. In less than five minutes, he was gone, whisked away by his entourage into a State Dining Room, away from the stampede.  Ms Macapagal just as promptly, also retreated to a private den.  "There's no F4, but we have FG here," a newsman said, referring to First Gentleman Jose Miguel Arroyo, who was showing off granddaughter Mikaela Angela for the cameras.  In the end, Yan returned to the Ceremonial Hall for the resumption of the photo session.  "F4" or "Flower 4" is the phenomenal Taiwanese boy band that spun off from the highly-successful "Meteor Garden" series where Yan belonged, together with Vic Zhou, Vanness Wu, and Ken Zhu, his co-stars in the soap opera.  Wu and Zhu had performed in a concert in Pasig City last September. Yan and Zhou were scheduled to perform in a concert later this month sponsored by the ABS-CBN television network.  Yan's visit was made possible by local garments firm Suyen Corporation, which markets the popular "Bench" brand. The pop star is the latest endorser of the brand, which also had Philippine showbiz luminaries in its stable of endorsers.  And so it was that for two hours at least, one Thursday afternoon, the brewing constitutional crises over the impeachment of Chief Justice Hilario Davide was elbowed out, pushed to the sidelines by a tall, charming television star who didn't speak English, much less understood what was eating up Malacañang these past days.

Arroyo, in an interview by Radio Mindanao Network from Tagbiliran, confirmed her appointment with Yan (Chinese name: Yang Cheng Xu), who is set to make a courtesy call at 2 p.m.  Arroyo said there is no political color in the meeting nor is she using the actor to boost her presidential bid in May 2004.  The President in 2001 also welcomed Argentinian actress Natalia Oreiro (Monica Brava) who made a courtesy call in Malacañang. Other presidents have in the past entertained famous persons like Thalia (Marimar, Roslainda) who visited then president Fidel Ramos in Malacañang, Fernando Carillo (Marimar) and NBA Player Kobe Bryant who went to Malacañang when Joseph Estrada was president.  Yan would be staying in the Philippines for two days to endorse Bench products. He would be officially launched as the newest Bench product image model at 10:30 a.m. in a press conference at the Le Pavillion in Roxas Boulevard before proceeding to Malacañang for the courtesy call. He would leave Friday night.  The actor is more popularly known in the Philippines as Dao Ming Xi or the leader of the F4 in the Meteor Garden-Meteor Rain series. Other members of the F4 are Taiwanese actor Vic Zhou (Chinese name: Zhou Yu Min); Ken Zhu (Chinese name: Zhu Xiao Tian) and American Vanness Wu (Chinese name: Wu Jian Hao).  He would return Nov. 28 with fellow Zhou and singing sisters Barbie and Dee Xiu for the ABS-CBN 50th anniversary Kapamilya concert at the Fort in Fort Bonifcaio on Nov. 29. Barbie, the love interest of Yan in the Meteor Garden-Meteor Rain series, was in the Philippines from Sept. 18 to 19 with her sister and F4 members Zhu and Wu for a one-night concert.  -----   urlLink  http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/oct/26/ent_1-1.htm   Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou coming for TV special  Posted: 9:52 PM (Manila Time) | October 25, 2003 By Marinel R. Cruz Inquirer News Service    (image from  urlLink http://comicfamily.mymuch.com/ )  AFTER the successful if riotous concert of F4's Vanness Wu and Ken Zhu at the Philsports Football Field last September, the two other heartthrobs from the disbanded Taiwanese pop group are also coming to Manila.   Jerry Yan and Vic Zhou are set to perform at The Fort in ABS-CBN's "Happy 50 TV: The Concert," on Nov. 29, according to Maloli Espinosa-Manalastas, the network's vice president for government, corporate affairs and public relations.   Network officials refused to disclose the amount of the talent fees of the two Taiwanese stars. But the fees alone are said to be in the whopping eight figures.   Jerry and Vic will perform with Barbie Xu and her younger sister Dee Xu, who had also performed with Vanness and Ken at the Ultra last Sept. 13.   Negotiations to bring Jerry and Vic to Manila started last month, when ABS-CBN executives met with the Taiwanese producers and talent managers of the artists. The deal was sealed only recently, when network officials led by senior vice president for TV production Cory Vidanes went abroad to sign the contract.   Jerry and Vic, stars of the phenomenally popular chinovela, "Meteor Garden," will be joined in the Fort show by local stars such as Ai-Ai de las Alas, The Hunks, Vina Morales, Kristine Hermosa, Claudine Barretto, and young love teams John Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo, and John Prats and Heart Evangelista.   The Ultra concert of Vanness and Ken was produced by Susan Lim's Big Slim Productions, with ABS-CBN as co-presenter. The show of Jerry and Vic at The Fort will be produced solely by ABS-CBN.   Both born in Taiwan, Jerry and Vic hardly speak English, unlike Vanness and Ken. An interpreter will be on hand when Jerry and Vic visit Manila next month.   Jerry is said to be coming to Manila earlier, in the first week of November, to hold a press conference for Bench, of which he is a new image model. He will return to Manila with Vic on Nov. 28, a day before the concert.   Bench reportedly paid Jerry 250,000 dollars, or 14 million pesos.  -----   urlLink  http://www.tsinoy.com/chopsuey/Spotlight.cfm?ID=32  SPOTLIGHT - 10/08/2003  Warning: Meteor Invasion!  by Blessy M.

A Taiwanese boy group did almost the same -- and more -- with just one hook, Meteor Garden.   Taken from a Japanese comic book series called Hana Yuri Dango (literally translated as "Men are Better than Flowers"), Meteor Garden tells the story of a poor girl falling in love with a rich boy-next-door and their journey of life and friendship with an elite college kada calling themselves "Flower Four" or simply "F4".   Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou, Ken Zhu, and Vanness Wu are the hunks behind this mass hysteria that glued the Filipinos into TV monitors. They are the rampaging boyband that has been sweeping the top spot in each radio station's hit list and the irony that makes non-Mandarin speakers sing Mandarin songs. And yes, they are also the very same reason why the Tsinoy Forum has been blogged with so many posts.

Books of inspiration, which have fared tremendously well in Taiwan in recent years, were the first genre to hop the strait and find favor with mainland readers. Then, fresh and accessible Internet literature came on the scene there, bringing numerous Web writers into the spotlight. Over the past two years Taiwanese illustrated books for children and adults,as well as books about the ambiguity of modern urban relationships, have also become favorites for the billion-plus Chinese language readers.  Readers in Taiwan and Hong Kong are highly capricious and easily tire of fashions, but the mainland market is vast, with great differences between the cities and the countryside. Bestseller lists support publishing trends in this vast market, but it takes several years time for a book's popularity to spread from the cities to remote bookstores in the countryside. Meanwhile, certain unique characteristics of the mainland's publishing market and readers are beginning to take shape.  The bookstores on Beijing's West Chang An Boulevard are packed on both working days and holidays. A petite Miss Wang is leafing through Separate Ways by the Taiwanese author Jimmy. She says that she lives in the suburbs and that it takes her an hour to get here, but that she comes every week to peruse the offerings: "It makes me feel that I'm not too far from a world of beauty."  "Jimmy's books will set you back RMB25 each-they're really too expensive-but I have collected several," says Wang, who also professes a fondness for inspirational books. When her spirits are low, she turns to Liu Yung's essays to help pick her up. She sells clothes in a shopping center and hopes to have her own boutique some day. These Taiwanese authors help motivate her to strive toward that dream.  Listening to Wang talk with confidence and composure, several college girls crowd around. Giggling and talking over each other, they say how much they like Wang Wenhua's Protein Girl: "The guys in it were like grown-up versions of the TV soap opera Meteor Garden starring [Taiwan singing group] F4," dreamily said a student named Chen. "I can't wait to start working so I can have romances like those."  -----   urlLink http://www.keepmedia.com/ShowItemDetails.do?itemID=307810&extID=10032&oliID=213  Newsweek  The Boys in the Band  by Alexandra A. Seno (With Erin Prelypchan in Manila) September 22 2003 (excerpts)  Many southeast Asians are full of worries about China, ranging from the effects of the region's new trade pact to how to compete with Beijing for foreign investment. But for tens of millions of young Asians, there is a far more burning question at hand: who is the cutest member of F4--Jerry, Vic, Ken or Vanness? The boy-band pop singers may be Taiwanese, but they sing in Mandarin and have Southeast Asia deep in the throes of a love affair with all things Chinese. Says Indonesian entertainment executive Daniel Tumiwa: "Mainland Chinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kongers.  For ordinary people here, it doesn't matter; it's just Chinese to them. It makes no difference. F4 is huge, huge, huge."  Not to mention hot, hot, hot. F4 is the first Mandarin pop band to win a devoted--some would say fanatic--pan-Asian audience. In many places, they are even bigger than the local acts--highly unusual in Asia's widely segmented music market. Pop tastes in east Asia have traditionally been split, with the north looking to Japan and Hong Kong, and the south to their home markets. F4 has radically altered the equation. They've sold 3.5 million albums--an astonishing number on a continent where pirated CDs are the norm. In Manila last week, fans paid up to $200--the equivalent of several months' salary--to see F4 members sing and dance live. Their faces loom large on billboards advertising Pepsi along Bangkok's expressways. On streets throughout the region, children can be heard belting F4 lyrics in passable Mandarin. "This is the first time I've ever seen a group actually conquering all markets here," says Mishal Varma, Singapore-based vice president for talent relations at MTV Asia. "No one else has crossed over the way they have."  Their staggering appeal is not easy to explain--even among music experts. A la 'N Sync, they don't play any instruments and they are not great singers. Few people even know what they're singing about. But the four twentysomething band members--Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou, Ken Zhu and Vanness Wu--belt out frothy tunes with a bubble-gum beat, and possess clean-cut good looks that have landed them on magazine covers, posters, key chains, T shirts and the bedroom walls of countless teenage girls. Indeed, their most committed fans know not just their birth dates but their blood types as well. They seem to possess that elusive blend of charisma and good timing that strikes only rarely among musicians. "In life, there comes only one Elvis Presley, one Ricky Martin, one F4," says Varma.  Their wholesome image is a big selling point. In person, the bandmates tend to be exceptionally polite. During an interview, Wu, the only F4 member who speaks fluent English, tosses off lines like, "The Vanness dream is to take care of my family one day so they don't have to work so hard." Such emphasis on family values plays well with young Asians. "F4 represents something they can aspire to within reach," says Ian Stewart, CEO of The Filter Group, an Asian trend consultancy. "Compared with Robbie Williams, Asians can connect more with F4."  The band's rise began with "Meteor Garden," a slick television drama launched in Taiwan two years ago. Based on a Japanese comic book, the series revolves around a group of Taiwanese students nicknamed F4--"Flower Four"--because they are so pretty. The show, massively popular in Taiwan, also turned into a runaway hit on Southeast Asian TV when dubbed or subtitled in local languages.  The program ran for two seasons. Like many Asian actors, the four boys also sang and danced. They quickly released two albums under Sony Music, and began playing to sellout crowds from Hong Kong to Manila. Today, in addition to touring, making TV appearances and hanging out together, the members are also busy working on solo careers. "We want to grow," says Wu, who just finished shooting his first film, a Hong Kong martial arts movie.  Wu laughs when asked if he feels famous. Three years ago, he was living in his native Los Angeles (he is named after the famous street in L.A. and San Francisco) and working as a customer-service rep for a phone company. Then he decided to indulge his passion and pursue a show-business career in Taiwan, where his parents were born. For the first year, he slept on friends' couches in Taipei. Now, though he's glad to have his own place, he says the band is still adjusting to its stardom. "We had never met until 'Meteor Garden'," he says. "Our personalities are so different, which is probably why our fans like us." Indeed, there seems to be something for everyone. Wu says he thinks he's seen as the extrovert, Jerry Yan is the funny but mercurial one, Vic Zhou is quiet but "off the wall" and Ken Zhu is "cool and collected--but a deep thinker."  The members have turned into unwitting ambassadors for greater China. Thanks largely to F4, Thais, Filipinos and Indonesians--not generally known for their interest in contemporary Chinese culture--are embracing it with a vengeance. In Jakarta, "There is growing acceptance that Chinese boys are good looking," says Tumiwa. "It's quite a shift here." Indonesia has had a checkered history with its Chinese population, highlighted by anti-Chinese riots and targeted violence. Now, the only mobs are those lining up to see F4 perform in concert. Young people are adopting F4's style of dress, which tends to be casual with a flair, such as tight jeans and fitted white shirts. Fans have also copied their trademark long hairstyles. Says Bangkok hotel clerk Praphaphorn Sithuha, an admitted F4 fanatic: "F4 has good style, they sing well and are very funny."  The band members have also sparked an unlikely interest in the Mandarin language. "Now my workers are listening to Chinese songs all day long," says Charlie Clement, a flower-farm owner in the central Philippines. "They sing along but don't understand." At least one is going even further; Thai fan Praphaphorn has a friend who was so inspired by the group that she enrolled in Chinese language lessons.  Not surprisingly, everyone is trying to discover the next F4. TV executives in Manila, for example, have been snapping up other Taiwanese soaps, like "Lavender" and "MVP Valentine." In Jakarta, the Taiwan all-male hip-hop group Energy, which also sings only in Mandarin, has been performing to packed crowds. "They have good music," says Harry Hui, Asia president for Universal Music. "[But] teenagers in Southeast Asia don't yet think of China as a source of cool." Just give them time.

Lim    (image from  urlLink http://www.sonymusic.com.tw/pop/f4/    My column last week, entitled, “Telenovela fans” led many to believe that the ensuing article was about F4.   For those who know me well, however, they would know that it would have been next to impossible for me to write about F4 because beyond the fact that I am not likely to know much about this Taiwan-based boy band due to my low IQ in music, I could never, in my lifetime, ever be a groupie.   Still, I contend F4 is a phenomenon. Only two members of the band came to Manila to sing but four songs yet the band together with its female co-star in the popular telenovela, “Meteor Garden,” spectacularly banned in the People’s Republic of China, attracted a crowd of 40,000. Some people actually paid up to P10,000 per ticket to see just half of this boy band.   Now aside from the fact that I am largely anti-social and would be inclined to avoid huge gatherings of people, I would never pay that much for a ticket. In fact, in my entire life, I have paid for less than ten concert tickets. And not because I don’t like music because I do despite my low IQ in this field. I just don’t believe in paying to see someone I can see for free like on tv.   Now, if you’re a concert queen, keep the blood pressure down. Different strokes for different folks. I spend my money elsewhere.   I must admit, though, that this Asian craze over F4 has given me a heightened awareness of this boy band. I have actually tried to sing their songs in the hope of broadening my views, improving my IQ in music and more importantly, practicing my Mandarin.   To my dismay, however, the lyrics of their songs are not expressed in pinyin (romanization of the Chinese language), at least on television. They are expressed in the usual pidgin version of pinyin that just drives a sword through the hearts of those who have been formally schooled under the pinyin method. So there goes my chance to be a karaoke queen.   Still, I really don’t see what the hysteria is all about. Is it their looks? Maybe I’m too old to appreciate them. Is it their music? Well, this, I can understand. But some fans actually have grand plans of stalking these people all the way to Taipei. Now, that’s major fanaticism.   I have seen a few international stars in the flesh like Michael Jackson, Jackie Chan and Donald Trump. They looked pretty normal to me despite their star status. If you’re curious about how a cheapskate like me got to rub elbows with these stars, well, it certainly wasn’t because I paid to see them. Oh no, that wouldn’t be me. That would be an impostor. I ran into these people in the course of my travels.   Any photos to prove these encounters? Well, it isn’t likely, is it? Don’t forget, I am no star-struck fan likely to be breaking through security for a photo op with some celebrity. So what am I doing writing about F4 this week?   Well, I don’t have to be a musical genius or groupie to recognize and appreciate the success of a band whose songs albeit I am unfamiliar with but whose fame has amazingly managed to penetrate even my musically challenged brain.  -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00000945&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  Stampede mars show of 'Meteor Garden' stars  September 15, 2003 01:10:00(LA) / 2003-09-15 17:10:00(Manila)  EVEN before "Meteor Garden" stars Vanness Wu and Ken Zhu could sing "Can't Lose You" and other hits at their one-night concert on Saturday at the Philsports Football Field (formerly Ultra) in Pasig City, unruly fans broke the barricade at the exit gate, resulting in a stampede that injured eight people.  Concert organizer Big Slim Entertainment Production attributed the stampede to "incessant rain" and "meticulous security checks."  Fans started arriving as early as 4 p.m., which was about the same time the gate of the Philsports Football Field was opened, according to police investigator Felipe Ramos.  The steel gate is the only entrance to the stadium, which can accommodate a crowd of 50,000. Some 40,000 fans watched the show.  At 8:30 p.m., a large crowd rushed toward the gate, causing it to collapse. The gate fell on the victims, said Ramos.  "I would have been one of the injured people had I not managed to run away from the falling steel gate," said Armin Magsaysay. "At that time, everyone wanted to get in because the concert was about to start."  Police identified the victims as Maribel Padayao, 17; Rosita Legaspi, 45; Rolando Onchangco, 40; Consuelo Rejano, 25; Catherine Calamlam, 34; Silverio Atienza, 42; Jocelyn Atienza, 55; and Julien Atienza, 11. They were brought to the Medical City Hospital in Mandaluyong at about 9 p.m.  Five people were discharged at around 10 a.m. Sunday, said Medical City Hospital press relations officer Marilyn Atienza. Padayao, Onchangco and Legaspi were still confined at the hospital but were now out of danger, according to Atienza.  There is no word yet on whether Big Slim Entertainment Production will shoulder the hospital expenses.  In a statement, the concert organizer apologized to ticket buyers for "difficulties or any inconvenience experienced in entering the venue."  It said the "meticulous security checks conducted specifically for the safety of the public" and "incessant rains" made it extremely difficult for the people to enter the stadium. Those who brought video and still cameras, mineral water bottles and soft drink cans were at first barred by Philsports security personnel.  Flower 4  Vaness (Mei Zhuo), and Ken (Xi-Men), members of the former pop quartet F4, or Flower 4, and Barbie Xu (Shan Cai) are three of the lead stars of the phenomenal youth show "Meteor Garden" on ABS-CBN.  The two other band members, Jerry Yan (Dao Ming Shi in Meteor Garden) and Vic Zhuo (Hua Ze Lei), had a show in Taiwan on the same day.  Disappointed fans  The three Taiwanese celebrities, along with Barbie's younger sister Dee Xu, arrived in Manila on Friday aboard two separate China Airlines flight from Taiwan to perform in a show billed as "The Event."  They returned home Sunday at 11 a.m., disappointing millions of viewers who were expecting them to make a live guest appearance on ABS-CBN's Sunday noontime variety show "ASAP Mania." In a press statement, ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. said it was "not in any way involved in the production of the concert" and was "merely a media partner" of the event producer.  The network, which holds the exclusive coverage of and interview rights to the visit of the Taiwanese stars, said it had "no participation in the handling or conduct of the concert."  The show started at 8:45 p.m. with half of its audience still standing outside the stadium.  Filipino talents Gary Valenciano, Kyla, The CompanY, Nina, South Border and Luke Mejares sang several songs before the Taiwanese celebrities were called to perform onstage at 10:30 p.m.  Big Slim Entertainment reportedly spent P25 million on talent fees alone for the three Taiwanese stars, in addition to picking up the tab for their accommodation and air fare and the cost of mounting the production.  This early, local producers are negotiating for their return in March, together with their "Meteor Garden" co-stars Jerry Yan and Vic Zhuo.(INQ7)   -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00000938&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  Complete F4 concert planned for March  September 14, 2003 06:12:00(LA) / 2003-09-14 22:12:00(Manila)  THIS early, local producers are negotiating for the return in March of Vaness Wu and Ken Zhu of the popular Taiwanese quartet F4, or Flower 4, together with their bandmates Jerry Yan and Vic Zhuo.  Vaness and Ken and their "Meteor Garden" co-star Barbie Xu performed in a concert called "The Event" at the Philsports football field last Saturday. Jerry and Vic had a show in Taiwan on the same day.  The arrangements for the March show were revealed by an official of the ABS-CBN, who asked not to be identified. The network had the exclusive rights to cover and interview the Taiwanese stars over the weekend.  The quartet is in the cast of the phenomenal Taiwanese show "Meteor Garden," aired daily on ABS-CBN.  In "Meteor Garden," Jerry is Dao Ming Shi, Vic is Hua Ze Lei, Vanness is Mei Zhuo and Ken is Xi-Men. Barbie is Shan Cai.  Vaness, Ken and Barbie arrived last Friday on board two China Airlines flights from Taiwan. They will fly back home at 9 a.m. on Sunday.  Inquirer Entertainment also learned that actor and TV host Richard Gomez interviewed Jerry Yan in Hong Kong recently. GMA-7 show biz talk show "S-Files" will air the exclusive interview on Sunday. Jerry is the newest image model of Bench, a Philippine line of clothes for the young.   -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00000921&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  'Meteor Garden' stars arrive for one-night gig  September 13, 2003 06:07:00(LA) / 2003-09-13 22:07:00(Manila)  WORK at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport came to a virtual stop for about 30 minutes Friday when two members of the phenomenally popular F4 boy band, who rose to fame through the successful "Meteor Garden" television drama series, flew in from Taiwan for a scheduled performance Saturday night at the Philsports football field.  Although only two members of the quartet made it here for the show, NAIA employees and visitors actually saw four, not just two Friday.  This was because of a neat trick devised by the concert organizers to protect the wildly popular band members who are the lead actors in the Taiwanese drama that has captured the hearts of Filipino soap opera fans.  While a huge crowd was gawking at what they thought were "Ken Zhu" and "Vaness Wu" as they emerged from a tube at Gate 4 of the NAIA Terminal 1, a smaller group was greeting the real Ken Zhu and Vaness Wu on the tarmac as soon as their China Airline plane touched down at 3:45 p.m.  The pair that came in through Gate 4 were actually Aaron Lim and MJ Coronel, employees of the ABS-CBN Talent Center who were dressed in maroon-colored shirts in the style of the real Ken and Vaness.  The network and the concert organizer, Vigslim Entertainment Production, had devised the plan to divert the attention of airport personnel, security, media and fans who were waiting for the arrival of the Taiwanese stars.  The genuine Vaness, who wore a plain white T-shirt, and Ken, who was dressed in an olive-green collarless shirt, rode in an ABS-CBN van, backed by a white Mercedez Benz van, that brought them to the EDSA Shangri-La Hotel in Mandaluyong City.  Most of the airport's workers left their posts a half-hour before the Taiwanese celebrities' scheduled arrival, and had gathered near Gate 4 to get a glimpse of their idols, unaware that the two young men they saw were decoys.  "Their (Ken and Vaness) Taiwanese handlers are extremely strict because of a traumatic experience that happened to the artists in another Asian country," explained Maloli Manalastas, ABS-CBN vice president for government, corporate affairs and public relations.  She said the ABS-CBN had been instructed to use only one video camera, and to ban the taking of still photos and even autograph signing.  Even the Taiwanese ambassador to the Philippines was reportedly not allowed to have his photo taken with the two F4 band members, Manalastas said.  The network holds the exclusive coverage and interview rights to the visit of the Taiwanese stars who are performing tonight in a show billed as "The Event."  Earlier Friday morning, the Meteor Garden's female star Barbie Xu (Shan Cai) had planed in with her sister Dee Xu, their mother and four Taiwanese delegates.  In the ensuing commotion, Barbie's mother was reportedly left behind on the plane, but she soon caught up with the six-member entourage.  The Inquirer learned that Ken and Vaness will be singing only four songs each in tonight's concert.  Filipino talents Gary Valenciano, Kyla, The CompanY, Nina, South Border, and Luke Mejares will fill up the rest of the show.  Tickets to the show cost 10,500 pesos, 5,000 pesos, 3,200 pesos, 2,000 pesos, 1,200 pesos and 500 pesos.  The two other F4 band members -- Jerry Yan and Vic Zhuo - were unable to make the trip due to previous commitments.  P25-M talent fee  Industry sources said Vigslim Entertainment spent 25 million pesos on talent fees alone for the three Taiwanese stars, in addition to picking up the tab for their accommodation and airfare and the cost of mounting the production.  Airport police chief Angel Atutubo said he was surprised at the "warm reception" that airport employees gave earlier Friday morning to Barbie's group and so decided to triple the security personnel for the arrival of Ken and Vaness in the afternoon.  "We didn't expect the airport staff members to be this excited. Even the janitors and security guards all wanted to see Shan Cai," said Atutubo.  Kristina Mapa, a Saudi Airlines passenger service agent, said she and other crewmembers left the plane as soon as it parked on the tarmac at 3 p.m. to await the arrival of the two "Meteor Garden" stars.  "This is my only chance to see the F4 because I was not able to buy tickets to their concert," said Andrea Custodio of Duty Free Philippines.  "I was told that as early as August, Ticketworld outlets were no longer selling tickets cheaper than 1,200 pesos," she said.  Aldo San Pedro, who described himself as a die-hard F4 fan, said: "I think the fans are being short-changed. They are not getting their money's worth. But I'm still going to watch the show."  At the EDSA Shangri-la Hotel, executives reportedly had to declare that the hotel was fully booked after receiving numerous reservations mostly from Chinese-Filipino fans of the group.  EDSA Shangri-la executive Sharon Cayanan suggested this may not just be because of the Taiwanese stars. She said the hotel was full because "there are lots of medical and international conventions going on."  On Sept. 21, ABS-CBN will air not the concert itself but a two-hour special to be hosted by Kris Aquino.  Ken, 24, was born in Taiwan but was raised in Singapore. He was a captain waiter in a Japanese restaurant before being discovered by the "Meteor Garden" producers.  Vaness, 24, was born in the US. He came to Taiwan to join a talent contest when he was asked to audition for the show.  Barbie is also popular in Taiwan as a singer and TV host. She is Big S in ASOS, a singing duo, with her sister, who is known as Small S.  She has been hosting a daily musical variety show in Taiwan, "100% Entertainment," for the past five years.  Police officials have warned motorists and commuters that unless they had pressing business in the area, they should stay away from the vicinity of the Philsports football field, formerly known as the Ultra Dome, in Pasig today.  Hundreds of vehicles are expected to clog up the streets surrounding the Dome as early as lunchtime as the concert of Vaness, Barbie Xu and Ken will be sure to draw thousands of fans from Metro Manila and nearby provinces, said Eastern Police District police chief Senior Superintendent Ernesto Catungal.  Catungal said authorities are not just concerned about the volume of vehicles but also car thieves.  Security will be extra tight, said EDP head Chief Superintendent Rolando Sacramento who met with Ultra Dome management and the concert's organizers on Wednesday to finalize security arrangements.  Plainclothes policemen will be fielded inside the concert hall itself and foot patrols and mobile cars will be doubled, he said.  "We have not received reports of sabotage or anything like that, but we are preparing all the same," Sacramento said.  "There is no stopping this concert now. Again, we urge the fans to be vigilant. If you see something that is not right, don't hesitate to approach the cops," he said.(INQ7)  -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00000873&category=  Asian Journal  'Meteor Garden' stars to undergo SARS tests  Francis Earl A. Cueto / Newspixels September 10, 2003 03:08:00(LA) / 2003-09-10 19:08:00(Manila)  Actors of the popular Taiwanese soap opera Meteor Garden will have to undergo SARS examination at the airport or face deportation, Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) general manager Edgar Manda said Wednesday.  "All those arriving in the country are required to undergo a SARS examination upon their arrival at the NAIA," Manda said in an interview.  He said authorities had informed promoters and organizers of the Taiwanese talents of the requirement.  Barbie Xu, popularly known as San Cai to Filipinos, and two members of the F4 boy band are scheduled to arrive in Manila on Thursday for their concert in Pasig on Saturday.   -----   urlLink http://www.chinapost.com.tw/archive/detail.asp?cat=1&id=41133   Filipinos just love to keep in touch with Taiwan's boyband F4  September 9, 2003 The China Post Nancy T. Lu    (image from  urlLink http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/f/f4.html  )  Unfamiliarity with Taiwan boyband F4 (Flower 4) in the Philippines nowadays means being out of touch. The names of the main characters in "Meteor Garden" and, of late, "Meteor Rain," have been on everyone's lips ever since the launching of the drama series on Philippines television in early May.  Try to listen closely. The "in" cellphone ring tone among young people is from the series, featuring the phenomenal foursome. Even the picture popping out on the screen of the cellphone features the hottest heartthrobs to hit the Philippine entertainment scene.  Sexy Philippine screen stars openly compare their boyfriends, husbands or lovers to the four members of F4 to drive home the point that the men in their lives are good-looking. Radio newscasters call each other Dao Ming Shi and his love interest, Shan Chai. Hua Zi Lei, Mei Zhuo and Xi Men, too, figure prominently in the fantasies of not just high-profile celebrities but also of lesser mortals like the ordinary men and women on the street. Take note: Filipinos identify them all by the names of the characters they portray in "Meteor Garden."  Dao Ming Shi, the lead male character portrayed by Jerry Yen (Yen Cheng-xu), threatened to be dislodged briefly at one point as the "crush ng bayan (crush of the entire country)" by Lt. Second Grade Antonio Trillanes IV, one of the military officers who led the failed July 27 mutiny in the financial district of Makati.  The hottest chinovela (as against the Mexican telenovela), which was produced in Taiwan, was impossible to ignore. The frequency of the plugs and commercials about it saw to that. The Philippine television network which carries the hit series even came up with a riotous spoof production, featuring popular midget stars.  After the program took the country by storm, Filipino children, in fact, tended to call every fair Chinese beauty or doll in the neighborhood Shan Chai. Young Filipinas meanwhile tried to copy her hairstyle.  The ABS-CBN television network was reported to be raking it in through commercials on "Meteor Garden" and "Meteor Rain." The figure quoted was one million Philippine pesos a day.  Even before the series made it halfway, "Meteor Garden" Rewind — meaning replay — kicked off on weekends to satisfy the public clamor for the drama series. Fans who got impatient with the episodes dragged out and stretched so much daily to accommodate more advertising contracts just went ahead and bought pirated copies of the hit series.  Actually the Philippine television network's marketing executives were reluctant at first to buy the TV series. After being informed that "Meteor Garden" was a big hit in Indonesia after it was aired in the Indonesian Bahasa language, they finally agreed to test the Philippine market. All the dialogues, however, were first dubbed in Tagalog. The rest was history.  Try visiting Metro Manila's shopping malls today. The four faces of Dao Ming Shi (Jerry Yen), Hua Zi Lei (Vic Chou), Mei Zhuo (Vanness Wu) and Xi Men (Ken Chu) pop up at every turn. Lately, they are not just affecting cool poses but also selling Pepsi.  The piped-in music in business establishments tends to be right out of "Meteor Garden." The Chinese songs of F4 are memorized by their Filipino fans. Youngsters who check out the hit chart in the cybercafes, in fact, sing effortlessly the F4 hits in Mandarin!  Philippine television today features an ongoing quest for the local version of the F4. The lip-synching contest sponsored by Sony Music regularly gathers in the TV studio young talents who copy the hairdos, the getups, the gestures and the dance steps of the incredibly successful boyband from neighboring Taiwan. Another competition urges children to audition for the chance to appear in a televised search for a kiddie version of the F4.  Even the magazine and comic book vendors in the wet markets are trying to cash in on the popularity of the F4 by selling their photographs and posters. Famous Filipino celebrities with big followings now have to play second fiddle to the imported idols.  Divisoria, the cheapest place in Metro Manila to buy just about anything, retails a whole gamut of F4 bargains: bookmarks, notebooks, mouse pads, stickers, fans, keychains, mugs, music cassettes, VCDs or DVDs and t-shirts. Pictures of the idolized four are helping sell tons of consumer products in the market.  And now that the news of a forthcoming visit by Vic Chou, Ken Chu and Barbie Hsu is out, fans are snapping up the tickets to the lone open-air concert dubbed "The Event" at the ULTRA in Metro Manila. The most expensive ticket costs no less than l0,000 Philippine pesos! The cheapest ticket is 500 pesos.  -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00000815&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  ABS-CBN: Other networks not allowed to cover F4 visit  September 6, 2003 23:43:00(LA) / 2003-09-07 15:43:00(Manila)  THERE might not be a "Meteor" shower on local television.  Inquirer Entertainment learned that other TV networks are banned from covering the arrival of the stars of "Meteor Garden," ABS-CBN's phenomenally popular chinovela, as the network makes sure it does an exclusive coverage of their Manila visit.  Vanness Wu (Mei Zhuo) and Ken Zhu (Xi Men), members of the former pop quartet F4, or Flower 4, and Barbie Xu (San Cai) are scheduled to arrive on board two China Airlines flights from Taiwan on Sept. 11.  Maloli Manalastas, ABS-CBN vice president for government, corporate affairs and public relations, confirmed that the network has the exclusive right to the coverage of the arrival of the Taiwanese stars.  "Its true that we are not allowing any other network to cover the arrival," Manalastas told Inquirer Entertainment last Friday. "We are still discussing this with airport officials."  Vanness, Ken and Barbie, who will be with her sister Dee Xu, reportedly will be given a welcome fit for dignitaries, including use of the presidential lounge at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport's Centennial Terminal.  Only the President and other top officials of the land are allowed to use NAIA's presidential lounge. Even Hollywood stars Lou Diamond Philips and Tia Carrere, who recently flew in to attend the 5th Makati Cinemanila International Film Festival, did not get to use the lounge.  The Taiwanese stars are coming to Manila to perform in a one-night show called "The Event" on Sept. 13 at the Philsports (Ultra) Football Field in Pasig City.  On Sept. 21, ABS-CBN will air not the concert itself but a two-hour special featuring the "Meteor Garden" stars. Kris Aquino will host the program.  NAIA General Manager Edgar Manda told Inquirer Entertainment that the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) has requested him in writing for a "security cover" for the Taiwanese stars.  Manda, however, refused to give details of the security measures that airport personnel would implement for the arrival of the Taiwanese stars.  "(TECO officials) feel that, with F4's popularity among Filipinos, the crowds might get unruly during the arrival," said Manda. "They simply want to be sure of the group's safety. We will see what we can do about their request. We also don't want to compromise our own security measures."  The Taiwanese celebrities reportedly will be using a different exit so that no other network, aside from ABS-CBN, could have access to them at the airport.  It is also said that reporters and production crew members from stations other than ABS-CBN would not be granted entry passes for the arrival.  "Meteor Garden" is shown weekdays on ABS-CBN. It also stars Jerry Yan as Dao Ming Shi, and Vic Zhuo as Hua Ze Lei.  Ken, 24, was born in Taiwan but raised in Singapore. He was a captain waiter in a Japanese restaurant before the show's producers discovered him.  Vanness, 24, was born in the US. He came to Taiwan to join a talent contest when the "Meteor Garden" producers asked him to audition.  Barbie is also popular in Taiwan as a singer and TV host. She is Big S in ASOS, a singing duo, with her sister, who is known as Small S.(INQ7)   -----   urlLink http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2003/sept/05/life/20030905lif2.html  The Manila Times Life & Times Friday, September 05, 2003 DEX & THE CITY By Dexter Osorio F4 is coming to town    (image from  urlLink http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/f/f4.html   The good news is that F4 is really coming to town.  The bad news is that F4 is not really coming to town; only two of its members have actually been booked for their much-awaited Manila concert, leaving entertainment writers no choice but to dub it as “the much awaited F2 concert” instead.  For those of you have been living in a cave for the last couple of months, F4 (pronounced “eff-por”) is the Taiwan­ese boyband that stars in the hit Chinese soap, Meteor Garden.  Meteor Garden has the unique distinction of single-handedly lifting its home television network out of debt—and never mind if the said television network had to use its top anchorpersons to plug it every night on its evening newscasts.  Anyway, “Meteor Garden,” is based on a Japanese manga, or comic book, entitled Hana Yori Dango, which literally means, “men are better than flowers.” (I am not making this up.)  The plot is simple enough: a poor but pretty girl named Shan Cai enters an exclusive school for filthy rich snobs and goes head-to-head with the school’s four handsome bullies, two of whom end up falling in love with her. The bullies are played by F4 (“Jerry” Yan Cheng Xu as Dao Ming Si, “Vic” Zhou Yu Ming as Hua Ze Lei, “Ken” Zhu Xiao Tian as Xi Men, and “Vanness” Wu Jian Hao as Mei Zhuo) while pretty Shan Cai is played by Barbie Xu.   The blood types of the four F4 members, for anybody who’s interested, are as follows: “Jerry” Yen Cheng Xu, blood type “B”; “Vic” Zhou Yu Ming, blood type “O”; “Ken” Zhu Xiao Tian, blood type “AB”; and “Vanness” Wu Jian Hao, blood type “A.”  These vital pieces of information, along with a host of others, are easily available through the four billion or so fansites posted on the web, presumably for the remote but not totally discount­able possibility that one of the F4 members might need a blood trans­fusion in the middle of a live perform­ance. (My advice to all you F4 fans: Be prepared.)  For their September 13 concert at the Ultra, only “Vanness” Wu Jian Hao and “Ken” Zhu Xiao Tian (no relation to Hap Tian) will be performing— although they will be joined by “Shan Cai” Barbie Xu.   But what has got everybody buzzing is the meteoric price of tickets— P10,500 for the best seats; P7,500 for the next best seats; P5,000 for the so-so seats; and so on, all the way down to P1,000 for the you-can-still-hear-them-even-if-you-can’t-see-them seats.   Some critics have pointed out that the ticket prices are too harsh, considering the current state of the economy and the sad plight of our less-fortunate country­men—and the fact that only half of F4 will be in Manila.  So in effect, the Filipino audience is being asked to pay full price for half the group, so that they can have the privilege of listening to songs that they don’t even understand.  But the tickets are not really that ex­pen­sive—it’s just a matter of pers­pective. Of course, even the lowest-priced, P1,000 tickets will seem expensive if you consider that the average cost of living in Metro Manila for a family of six is only P530.01, but that’s an unfair comparison, if you ask me.  Think of it this way: the price of the most expensive F4 concert ticket is just two-hundred-millionth of the country’s Gross National Product. See? I told you it’s just a matter of perspective.  I guess Filipinos have no choice but to scrimp on some of their other luxuries if they want to see F4 live in concert.  So I have taken the initiative and compiled a handy comparison guide based on current retail prices.  One front row ticket to the F4 concert is roughly equivalent to:  • 500 kilos of rice  • 724 bars of laundry soap  • 807 bottles of beer  • 954 rolls of toilet paper  • 1312 cans of sardines  • 2000 packs of instant ramen   noodles  • 3230 chicken eggs  • 9,545 boxes of matches  • 10,500 Choc-nut bars  • 15,750 pieces of Storck menthol candy  • enough ikot jeepney fare to take you 3,000 times around the University of the Philippines.  -----   urlLink http://www.showbizpinoy.com/gossip/sept_wk1/f2.asp  Showbiz Pinoy  No special treatment for F2 and Barbie at NAIA      No special treatment awaits the members of the popular Taiwanese boy band F4, at least as far as the airport is concerned.  This was stressed yesterday by Edgardo Manda, general manager of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), amid reports that two of the four band members are set to arrive in the country any time next week to hold a concert here.  Reports have it that Vanness Wu Jian Hao and Ken Zhu Xiao Tian are set to arrive in the Philippines along with female Chinese singer-actress Barbie Xu Xi Yuan. The three portray Mei Zuo, Xi Men and Shan Cai, respectively, in the Chinovelas Meteor Garden and Meteor Garden 2 which are aired on ABS-CBN 2.  Manda said that like others who come from Taiwan, the three - as well as Dee Xu, Barbie's sister and co-member in the ASOS band - will be subjected to the usual checks required of all inbound passengers.  "We'll make sure that they will undergo the required screening," Manda said, in reference to the health checks being conducted by airport authorities on passengers coming from countries formerly listed by the World Health Organization as having been affected by the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory System.  Manda was planning to scale down the health screening processes on travelers coming from SARS-affected countries when most of the places in the WHO list were cleared after they licked the illness. Leading the list were Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Taiwan.  However, he changed his mind when two domestic helpers - one coming from Taiwan and another from Hong Kong - fell ill days after coming home, showing symptoms similar to those of SARS.  This prompted Manda to again raise the alert level against SARS, ordering that the rigid screening be continually done on inbound passengers at least until 2005.  The usual procedures consisted of passing through a thermal scanning machine and the putting of thermal strips on the forehead of a passenger, to make sure that he does not have fever, a main symptom of SARS.  Those found to be running a fever are immediately isolated, interviewed and further examined to ensure that they do not have SARS.  Once at the immigration counter, the passenger is asked questions which serve the purpose of contact tracing or determining who the passenger got in contact with before coming to the Philippines, where he will stay and for how long.  -----   urlLink http://www.asianjournal.com/cgi-bin/view_info.cgi?code=00000620&category=  Asian Journal from the Philippine Daily Inquirer  Only Ken, Vaness, Barbie coming for one-night show  August 22, 2003 05:02:00(LA) / 2003-08-22 21:02:00(Manila)  TWO MEMBERS of the wildly popular Taiwanese quartet F4, or Flower Four, and Barbie Xu, known as the chinovela character "San Cai," all of "Meteor Garden" fame, are being brought to Manila to perform in a one-night show called "The Event" on Sept. 13, reportedly at a cost of 25 million pesos.  A source from the concert organizers said the big amount would only pay for the talent fees of Vaness Wu (Mei Zhuo) and Ken Zhu (Xi-Men), two of the members of the now-disbanded F4, and Barbie Xu (San Cai).  The show will be held at the Philsports (ULTRA) Football Field in Pasig City.  Vaness, Ken and Barbie are three of the five lead stars of the phenomenal Taiwanese youth show "Meteor Garden," shown on weekdays on ABS-CBN. The series also stars Jerry Yan, who plays Dao Ming Shi, and Vic Zhou, who is Hua Ze Lei.  Former "That's Entertainment" talent Joed Serrano, now a concert producer through Vigslim Entertainment Production, refused to disclose the exact amount of the talent fees for the Taiwanese stars.  "All I can say is that the (talent fee) is super O.A. sa mahal," said Serrano, who is part of the marketing division of Vigslim Entertainment.  He said tickets to the concert are priced 10,500 pesos, 5,000 pesos, 3,200 pesos, 2,000 pesos, 1,000 pesos and 500 pesos.  He said "The Event" would also feature Barbie's younger sister, Small S, who is also a celebrity in Taiwan, as well as several Filipino artists.  Barbie, who is called Big S, also belongs to a band named ASOS.  The Philsports Football Field, which can accommodate a crowd of 50,000, was also the venue for the concerts of Boyz II Men, Phil Collins, Barry Manilow, Stevie Wonder, Gloria Estefan and Earth, Wind and Fire.(INQ7)   -----   urlLink http://www.yehey.com/tabloids/print.aspx?a=12121  Yehey!  Tabloids Showbiz  The Meteor Garden Files (Part 43)  7/31/2003 1:37:00 PM The Journal Group  The day Vic's eyelid got caught in Batbire's bra clasp  Here now are the comments of Barbie Xu Xi Yuan (Shan Cai) on F4, her costars in Meteor Garden and Meteor Garden 2, as well as thumbnail sketches of the F4 guys.  * * *  SHE is the only woman in a serial with four hot-blooded men.  How does Barbie Xu cope?  In between filming the Chinovela, she quips over the phone that her costars have yet to make a move on her.  "I am puzzled. After all, my qualities are quite good. If they did [court her], I’d definitely accept them because they’re all so cute!"  Never mind that she is older than them.  Barbie, who says she is very much like her Meteor Garden character Shan Cai ("I’m famous in Taiwan for being straightforward"), pre-empts any questions from the press about reel-to-real romance among the cast.  "Vic Zhou and I get along very well. I’ve even made him my god-brother. We talk to each other in incomplete, incoherent sentences, so people overhearing us often think we’re crazy."  She once told him to brush his teeth, gargle and chew gum before shooting their kissing scene, and was amused to see him following her instructions to the letter.  Of Jerry Yan, she says: "Jerry and I share some daring love scenes. My mother said she was embarrassed to watch them.  Sometimes we get bored with kissing take after take, so we’d start to fool around — he bit my nose once and the whole thing disintegrated into a joke.  Barbie had known Vanness before the serial and felt comfortable with him — another fact that Taiwan’s tabloids pounced on.  And what does she have to say about Ken?  "He likes to read.’"  JERRY YAN CHENG XU  Family: Raised by his mother.  Path to fame: Was a part-time model in his student days. Gained attention after he won Taiwanese magazine Men’s Uno model competition in 1998. Starred in many commercials before he was handpicked for Meteor Garden.  Plays: Dao Ming Si, leader of F4. Wealthy, obnoxious and a bully.  Real/reel similarity: "I’m rather bad-tempered like him. When it comes to love, we are also similar. When I like someone, I am direct about revealing how I feel."  Most memorable scene: A kissing scene with Barbie which took many takes, some lasting 20 minutes. "I was very nervous! But after a few tries, it got better. But I made sure not to touch her more intimately than necessary, so people won’t say we were playing for real."  First brush with tabloids: Scribes claimed amorous intent when talk-show host Matilda Tao gave him a diamond necklace in return for a pen he gave her.  From the horse’s mouth: "I fell down after filming and Tao Zi was very concerned about me. She came to the set to give me a massage. I call her ’sister.’"  VIC ZHOU YU MIN  Path to fame: A Mechanical Engineering student at a Taiwanese technical institute, Zhou accompanied a friend to audition for a role in the show, but was discovered by the producer instead.  Plays: Hua Ze Lei, the free-spirited and contemplative member of F4.  Real/reel similarity: "When the show became popular, I became even more reclusive like him! I’m afraid of the press spotting me if I go out in ratty clothes, so I simply refuse to go out much anymore."  Most memorable scene: His eyelid once got caught between Barbie’s bra clasp in a hugging scene. "Before that, there were a lot of NG (no good) scenes, so I just endured the pain until the director shouted ’Cut!’ When I told Barbie, she just laughed and hit me playfully."  Preferred girlfriend: He’s had a crush on Hsu Hsi-ti (Small S), Barbie’s sister and her comember in the band ASOS. "She’s very bubbly and open," he says.  Future plans: "I just want to act well and not think too far into the future.’ He also wants to continue with his studies.  KEN ZHU XIAO TIAN  Family: Born in Taiwan, but was raised in Singapore by a guardian. In the eight years he lived there, he attended Bukit Merah Primary and Boon Lay Secondary. "I consider myself a Singaporean. I miss the food and shopping."  Path to fame: Was discovered while working as a captain in a Japanese BBQ restaurant. This pretty boy is also a good cook who likes to whip up "simple dishes."  Plays: Xi Men, the playboy. In the show, the F4 frequently have to fend off disgruntled men who have had their girlfriends pinched by him.  Real/reel similarity: Ken is a diehard romantic. He reveals that his first love, in Secondary 3, had been a girl from Thomson Secondary named Lin Xin Yu, a "cute Malaysian girl, a friend of my sister’s. It ended when she went to Australia for further studies in 1996."  VANNESS WU JIAN HAO  Origin of name: His moniker is the name of a road in his hometown of Los Angeles. "My Dad chose it because he thought it sounded nice."  Family: American-born Chinese. "Growing up was hard; my parents are separated." But his family still enjoys "close, good relations. While filming, I missed home terribly and wanted to give up, but my family dissuaded me."  Path to fame: When he was 13, he started practising dance moves with ex-ABC boy band, The L.A. Boyz. He wanted to make a record, but it fell through. His sister, Stacy Wu Jia Jia, cut an album in 1995 with the group Babes. "I’ve always been interested in acting. So I came to Taiwan to be a part of the entertainment scene." He joined Super Sunday’s YMCA segment, a male talent contest-cum-pageant. He was spotted by the series’ producers, who asked him to audition.  Plays: Sly and playful Mei Zuo. "He’s a sunshine boy, happy-go-lucky and spur of the moment."  -----   urlLink http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/sb/sb002891.htm  Quezon City July 21 2003  FUNFARE By Ricardo F. Lo  The Philippine Star (excerpts)   Meteor Garden theme song translated   First, the bad news: The F4 guys, stars of the phenomenally-successful ABS-CBN chinovela (a word coined by Viva Boss Vic del Rosario, Jr.) Meteor Garden, aren’t coming for a concert. If they ever do, it might be long from now and by then, who knows, they might not be as popular as they are now.  And now, the happy news: The group hasn’t disbanded contrary to rumors. According to sources at Sony Music (distributor of F4 albums here), the four idols – Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou, Ken Zhu and Vanness Wu – are now busy recording their latest album which will be released early next year. Meteor Garden fans should pray hard that F4 will include the Philippines in its itinerary if ever they decide to embark on an Asian promo tour. F4 is a big hit not only in the Philippines but also in Taiwan (their home base), Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and other parts of Asia.  Meanwhile, Funfare readers have been requesting for the English translation of the Meteor Garden theme song entitled Qing Fei De Yi. Here it is, courtesy of Sony Music Philippines:  I.

People are crazy over them and our leaders are dumbfounded. Maybe our presidential aspirants should form their own F4.  One morning, I switched to a local music TV channel and for 30 minutes, all they showed are the F4 singing their song in Chinese with lyrics in westernized Chinese. The only line we know is "Baby, baby O baby baby."  What are they singing, I asked a college student in STI, whose school is near our house. It's a song, it's a poem.  Oh my God, give me Joe Guevarra anytime.  -----   urlLink http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/Forbes/2003/07/07/180636?from=search  Forbes  Big--But Not Here   These foreign acts tear up the charts--on their home turf.

And at the same time funny. If you have been following my column (which I hope you have been doing) you would have noticed that I have tried to do a variety of topics. I have talked about text, "rules" of marriage lessons, movies, Davao. And in those times I have received a few emails commenting on what I said.   I was so disturbed about the airport bombing that occurred that I had to ask permission from Mr. Ajero if I could just write something because I needed to. I was so relieved when he agreed. When I wrote about that incident I also got a few emails. But when I checked my email this morning I got a surprise. I had a record number of emails about my Meteor Garden article. Grabe!   Some of the letters agreed with what I said and then there were some who thought otherwise. One writer even said that I was so judgmental of those who watch that show and what did F4 do to me for them to merit my article. One writer even wrote that I was a crab trying to pull everyone down!   And this is exactly my point. The intensity that I wished people would have for something so painful as an airport bombing was nowhere to be found. I was hoping that after the bombing people would be so mad that they would take the time to write letters to express their feelings. I was hoping that they would sit down and vent out their anger and sorrow.   Even the Bacani article brought only silence. But F4? I got a flood of letters! Most of them by the way were extolling the virtues of Meteor Garden! I have nothing against F4 or Meteor Garden by the way. I am just sickened with the gullibility that we have. I am so mad at the apathy that we have. A lot of us are just too na‹ve.   There is killing in our streets and we do not say anything. Poverty is killing our people and we remain silent. Corruption strangles us. We have pedophiles, abusive priests, murderers in motorcycles, drug pushers and drug addicts and we say nothing. But when someone says something about F4, the silence is broken. Wow! No wonder this country is dying.   You know F4 and Meteor Garden do not really matter. They really do not. They could be swallowed by a black hole or be replaced anytime and we would have another boy group that will claim the hearts of our young women. Meteor Garden can go and be replaced by Asteroid Orchard or Supernova Farm or some other show. People will still gobble it up.   Ganun tayo ka....  No wonder we elect entertainers. No surprise that if a movie star flashes his or her smile most of us just drop dead. No wonder and surprise that whatever they say we believe.   One of the best definitions that I ever read about insanity goes something like this; that insanity is doing the same thing again and again but expecting a different result. That is so true and that is what madness is really like. Doing the same thing but expecting a different outcome.   First we had the Mexican soap opera and if you remember how we fell for it too. Everyone was talking about it. Then now we have this. And again the whole country is head over heels over F4. Next thing the men will be sporting their haircuts and speaking like them. A few nights ago I was so amused when I saw Lilo and Stich on TV but after awhile I had to change channels because guess who was singing over the Lilo and Stitch animation.   One writer claimed that this was just an escape from work and reality. And I suppose by watching we shall be able to solve our problems? And I guess that after reading this article some will be so irate that they will write me again?   Listen; take a look outside your window. Look for the child who sleeps in the cold pavement because he has no home. Look for the battered wife whose eyes seek the heavens for relief, seek out the man who needs to feed his family because they are literally starving to death, hold close to your bosom the aborted fetus, pause for a moment and think about all those who cannot eat tonight. And then try to do something. Find your rage and your fire. Do something.   F4 will go away. A flash in the pan so to speak and we will eventually tire of them but our problems will remain. And what shall we do? Get all the F4 posters and cover the stench? The stench will not go away because we are too busy watching some show that acts as an escape from the pain and the sorrow of life. We are too pained and sad to face life so that we have to turn to shows like Meteor Garden? Is that it?   If you need to write, write about the summary killings. If you need express your anger write about priests who defile the purity of celibacy, if you wish to wax indignant, march in the streets to fight for justice. But F4? Meteor Garden?   Well, I suppose this is a free country.  -----   urlLink http://www.peyups.com/article.khtml?sid=2325  Peyups:  where bright minds meet  Tembtation : Meteor Garden sa Peyups  Contributed by tembarom (Edited by mananalaysay)   Friday, June 06, 2003 @ 12:00:26 AM     (image from  urlLink http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/f/f4.html )  Ligtas na ang Pilipinas SARS virus, at least for now. Pero may bagong virus na kumakalat sa buong Asia at ngayo'y nasa atin na rin: ang F4 virus.   Kung hindi mo alam kung ano 'yung F4, okay lang 'yan. Dati, bago ako mahawa ng girlfriend ko, wala rin akong idea kung ano ang F4, maliban sa matatagpuan ito sa keyboard ng computer. (You know, parang Ctrl at End.) Ngunit huwag mo akong kasuklaman at sorry kung sabihin kong medyo slow ka.  So, for the benefit ng mga slow, ii-explain ko na 'yung F4 ay ang grupo ng apat na mga kabataang lalaki na bida sa Meteor Garden, isang drama sa TV na galing sa Taiwan. Sila sina Jerry Yan Cheng Xu na gumaganap bilang Dao Ming Si, Vic Zhou Yu Min as Hua Ze Lei, Ken Zhu Xiao Tian as Xi Men, at Vanness Wu Jian Hao as Mei Zuo.  Pero hindi lang ang F4 ang elemento ng F4 virus, siyempre pa'y hindi mawawala si Barbie Xu Xi Yuan na gumaganap naman bilang Shan Cai, ang magandang babaeng pinag-aagawan ng F4.  Halos buong bansa yata ay infected na ng F4 virus o Meteor Garden mania (na siguradong labis namang ikinatutuwa ng higanteng ABS-CBN dahil nag-aakyat ito tiyak ng grabeng tubo sa kanila). Pagsapit ng 5:30 p.m., nalilimutan ng bayan ang pagiging tuta ng Kano ng kanilang pangulo. Inaabangan ng marami ang palabas at kinikilig sa love triangle nina Dao Ming Si, Shan Cai, at Hua Ze Lei.  Umaabuso na nga ang ABS-CBN sa araw-araw na paggatong sa Meteor Garden mania. At habang nagwawala ang bagyong si Chedeng, ang mga Meteor Garden posters at pictures sa mga bangketa nama'y dinudumog ng mga fans na girls, boys, at charing.  Naiisip ko tuloy kung pati ang UP ay nahawahan na rin kaya ng pagkaadik sa Meteor Garden. Ang mga TV kaya sa Kalayaan at iba pang dorms ay nakatutok sa Channel 2 kapag 5:30 na? May mga nakadisplay na kayang Meteor Garden posters sa mga kuwarto ng mga iskolar ng bayan? O di kaya'y may mga larawan na ng F4 at ni Shan Cai sa kanilang mga wallet?  Balita ko, kaya yata Meteor Garden ang tawag sa palabas, dahil may isang eksena kung saan habang binibigyan ni Dao Ming Si si Shan Cai ng magandang kuwintas ay nagkaroon ng meteor shower. Nasa balkonahe yata sila ng mansyon ng lalaki at syempre, kadalasa'y tanay mula sa balkonahe ang hardin (di lang ako sure kung ganito ang ayos ng mga mansyon ni Erap para sa kanyang mga kulasisi). How romantic, 'no? Sabi nga lang ni Ate Glow (na taga-MassComm), ansaya-saya, 'no?  Meteor shower? Garden? Hmmm, familiar din 'yan sa mga taga-UP. Ilang beses na ba tayong nanood ng meteor shower sa Sunken Garden? Kahit nga sa Peyups.com forums, may thread pa tungkol sa panonood ng pagbagsak ng mga bituin mula sa kalawakan habang nakahiga at nagkakan...tahan sa Sunken.  At saka I'm sure, mas matitinding love story at kung anu-ano pa pa ang nabubuo (o kaya'y nawawasak o napupunit) sa Sunken.  Hmmm, kung gayo'y talagang hindi lamang sa Taiwan may Meteor Garden, sa pamantasang hirang din. Pero sana, kahit may SARS sa Taiwan, huwag nang magkaroon nito sa UP!  -----   urlLink http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/jun/05/ent_2-1.htm  Entertainment  Ni hao, Taiwan soap 'Meteor Garden' Posted: 10:31 PM (Manila Time) | June 04, 2003 By Leah Salterio Inquirer News Service    BRISK sales in Quiapo of the posters of the Taiwanese stars of the TV soap, "Meteor Garden."   Photo by Eric Arazas, INS (image from  urlLink http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/jun/05/ent_2-1.htm )  FROM "telenovela" to "chinovela."  The hearts of soap opera-crazy Filipino televiewers have found a new target: the Taiwanese drama series, "Meteor Garden."  And Filipinos have traded their infatuation for Mexican actors and are instead going ga-ga over the Taiwanese boy band F4, or Flower 4, who are the lead actors in the chinovela now being aired on ABS-CBN.  The chinovela revolves around the concerns of teenagers-their loves and their families.  "Meteor Garden," which is dubbed in Filipino, started airing in the country only last month, but its phenomenal success has prompted ABS-CBN to enter into negotiations with Taiwanese producers to bring F4 to the country for a concert at the Araneta Coliseum in August.  A source at the television network said the talent fee of the group alone would cost them one million dollars (53 million pesos).  One avid follower who never missed a single episode of the chinovela is Charity Cruz, a high school student at the O.B. Montessori in Sta. Ana, Manila. But the 14-year-old is now worried because classes are about to start. She said she might not be able to watch the series, and her idol Dao Ming Si.  Jocelyn Dy, an incoming high school senior at the Philippine Pasay Chung Hua Chinese School, is looking forward to the band's concert in the Philippines. She bought a poster of the quartet at the Pasay market where they were selling briskly.  Fifth grader Alexis Nadine Galimba is also crazy about the series. She keeps a poster of the popular quartet inside her bedroom.  Surprisingly, the fan base of "Meteor Garden" is not limited to young school girls.  Marie Jennylyn Rose Uyao, a mother of a 5-year-old, makes it a point to be in front of her TV at 5:30 p.m., when the program airs on ABS-CBN.   Housewife Pacita Abad has to fight with her son, who prefers MTV, just so she could watch "Meteor Garden."  Based on the popular Japanese manga (comic book) "Hana Yori Dango" ("Men Are Better Than Flowers"), "Meteor Garden" is set in an affluent high school in Taiwan.  The series opened with a plain girl, San Cai, (played by 25-year-old Makino Tsukushi) from a middle-class family entering the school of filthy-rich snobs. She stands up to four bullies (F4), and wins the hearts of two.  The members of F4 are Jerry Yen Cheng Xu, 25, who plays Dao Ming Si; Vic Zhou Yu Ming, 20, who plays Hua Ze Lei; Ken Zhu Xiao Tian, 22, who plays Xi Men; and Vanness Wu, 23, who plays Mei Zhuo.  The series transformed the four young men from virtual unknowns into pop idols who trigger mass hysteria.  The series debuted in Taiwan in April 2002, and in only a short time, the four men have become household names not only in Taiwan, but also in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Brunei.  Their debut album sold over 180,000 copies in Taiwan alone. The album made it to No. 3 in the local charts three days after it hit the shelves. It is bannered by the carrier single, "Meteor Rain."  The chinovela has become so popular in the Philippines that ABS-CBN had to move its timeslot from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  According to a May 27 survey by AGB Philippines, "Meteor Garden" got a 68-percent audience share among viewers in Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite and Bulacan. The survey was based on overnight ratings.  Overnight ratings are results for a specific day that are compiled over a one-week period before being officially released to the public. Usually, overnight ratings are reflective of the trend for the whole week.  Earlier AGB surveys (May 18-24) showed "Meteor Garden" getting a rating of 29.6 percent. It occupied the No. 5 slot that week.   With a report from Abigail Ho  -----   urlLink http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2003/06/03/life/f4.mania.intensifies.html  Sun Star Manila Tuesday, June 03, 2003  F4 mania intensifies  By Annie Alejo  The times sure have changed. The ancient Chinese used to believe that the digit 4 is not a good number (the Chinese word for 4 sounds like the Chinese word for "die"). Now it seems 4 can be anything but unlucky. In fact, it definitely seems to be a lucky number now!  Banking on the popularity of the youth TV drama "Meteor Garden," F4 are now taking Asia by storm. In the Philippines, gone are the days when we've gone crazy over English-dubbed Spanish telenovelas. These days, these four boys rule!  Taiwanese sensation F4 are the four guys that captured the hearts and minds of so many teenage girls all across Asia. And wherever they go, throes of young, screaming females storm airports and shopping complexes where they appear, causing such a furor in Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia. Here, their growing legion of fans can only hope they make a stopover too.  Undoubtedly, the top-rated TV show "Meteor Garden," in which they play the wealthy and enigmatic gang called F4, is the main key to their success. It is adapted from the manga or Japanese comic, "Hana Yori Dango," meaning Boys are Better Than Flowers, which is where F4's name comes from. "Hana Yori Dango" is a cult favorite that has already spawned a highly popular animated series, a movie and, of course, "Meteor Garden."  F4 is made up of Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou, Ken Zhu and Vanness Wu. All four agree that the characters they play in "Meteor Garden" are similar to their own real-life personalities. Jerry, who plays Dao Ming Shi, sees himself as aggressive and very direct when he likes a girl. Vanness, who plays the happy-go-lucky Mei Zhuo, is very easy-going and loves to have fun. Ken, who plays the playboy Xi Men, thinks of himself as a die-hard romantic. And Vic Zhou, who makes girls swoon as the serious Hua Ze Lei, doesn't like the attention of celebrity, much like his reclusive alter ego.  Jerry was a student and a part-time model before he was handpicked to play F4's enigmatic leader. Vic was taking up mechanical engineering at a technical institute; he only accompanied his friend to the "Meteor Garden" auditions and was spotted instead. Ken was a chef when "Meteor Garden" producers spotted him dining in the restaurant where he worked. American-born Vanness, the only F4 member who can speak English, went to Taiwan to join the entertainment scene and was in a variety show contest when he was asked to audition for the series.  Halfway through the filming of the first season of "Meteor Garden," the boys recorded Meteor Rain, which has now been made available in record stores all over the Philippines. The album boasts of 10 radio-friendly romantic tracks written in Mandarin but with Western influences and some peppered with English lyrics.  Their second album, Fantasy 4ever, features the current hit, "Can't Lose You," also known by many non-Taiwanese speaking fans as the "Oh baby baby, my baby baby..." song. The album comes with a special bonus VCD with videos of "Can't Lose You" and the single that's also becoming popular with F4 fanatics, "Season of Fireworks."  But before you run off to your favorite record bars, fans that may actually miss some local episodes of "Meteor Garden" once school starts can comfort themselves with this good news. Aside from the two exciting F4 albums, two VCDs will also be released. Meteor Rain karaoke VCD features videos for all the songs you can find on Meteor Rain, with accompanying lyrics to sing along to. And the Fantasy 4 Live Concert World Tour, on the other hand, is a two-hour VCD of one of the biggest, most awesome concerts these boys have done. Not only will you see F4 performing their songs live, the concert is packed with fabulous dance numbers (the highlight is a special footage of Jerry and Vanness showing off their moves) and high-tech special effects.  Four handsome and talented boys, four must-have albums. If you still haven't caught the F4 fever, it's high time you check out what the fuss is all about. And chances are, F4 will not disappoint.  -----   urlLink http://www.hkentreview.com/2003/may/0507to0509/0507to0508.html  Fluff May 8, 2003 (excerpts)    (image from  urlLink http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/f/f4.html   Production News: Shaun Tam Jun-Yin, Roy Chow Wing-Hang, Chin Kar-Lok and Andy On Chi-Kit are busy training for the new action movie SIU NIN AH FU (lit.

A full house watched as Leung made her entrance riding on the back of a mechanical swan. The usually demure Leung was wearing a green and white robe which she promptly ripped off to reveal a sexy hotpants ensemble. The outfit was not the only sexually suggestive part of her show as Leung would later do a dance routine that featured simulated groping by a female backup dancer. While boyfriend Ekin Cheng Yi-Kin could not be at the show because he was shooting MY DREAM GIRL in Shanghai, Leung's mother and her twin brother were in the crowd to support her. Unlike Miriam Yeung Chin-Wah, Leung held her emotions in check. The only time tears threatened to flow was when Leung dedicated a song to her mother.  Sammi Cheng Sau-Man and F4's Ken Zhu Xiao-Tian were Leung's guest performers.  -----   urlLink http://www.hkentreview.com/2003/march/0310to0312/0310.html  Fluff March 10, 2003  (excerpts)    F4 at post-concert party.

All of Pepsi's Chinese market celebrity spokespersons -- F4, Jay Chou (Chow Kit-Lun), Sammi Cheng Sau-Man, Aaron Kwok Fu-Sing, Comic Boyz, Shine and Edison Chen Kwoon-Hei -- performed at the event. The show got off to a raucous start when a surprise appearance by Leslie Cheung Kwok-Wing -- Pepsi's first Chinese region celebrity pitchman -- sent the crowd into a frenzy. Cheung joined Pepsi executives for the concert's opening festivities. Speaking to the audience, Cheung said: "I don't know what to say. I'm very happy to see the ability of this next generation of stars. I'm sure they will show you a good time. Although I won't be performing here on stage, I'll be in the crowd admiring their work and clapping for them."  With that, F4 started the show with a bang. The Taiwanese supergroup received the biggest ovation of the evening. Jay Chou, another Taiwan-based talent, received the second biggest ovation. The third loudest went to local artist Aaron Kwok with Sammi Cheng's ovation coming in fourth.  Miscellaneous notes from the event: Sammi Cheng and Jerry Yan Cheng-Xu of F4 performed a dance routine together. In its coverage of the segment, Oriental Daily News commented that Jerry Yan had more cleavage than "runway chest" Sammi Cheng ... Wearing a Vancouver Canucks throwback jersey, Edison Chen forgot the lyrics to his songs multiple times. He stopped mid-performance, yelled in digust and apologized to crowd. At the post-concert party, Chen blamed his poor performance on "Hung Hom Coliseum disease": "Every time I perform at the Coliseum it happens. I feel a lot of pressure when performing here. I'm not used to having the crowd all around me" ... Aaron Kwok also messed up some lyrics during his performance. Kwok, however, was battling a bout of the flu ... Contrary to speculation that their breakup was imminent, F4 appeared friendly towards each other on stage and at the post-concert party.  -----   urlLink http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/Variety/2003/03/09/10298?from=search  Variety  Auds want their Hub TV  by MAGZ OSBORNE March 09 2003  SINGAPORE Viewers in Singapore are doing more than just watching the telly, thanks to Hub TV.

The guarded manner in which they fielded questions in the press room proved that for this pair, it's safety in numbers.  When asked whether they'd give away their Inspiration Award like Robbie Williams did, Ken sputtered rather sarcastically: 'We are not Robbie Williams.'  An intrepid reporter even ventured to ask the age-old will-F4-split-up-after- their-tour question.  Vanness replied irritably: 'We've been asked that a hundred times already! We'll just wait slowly and see. We have other projects, but F4 is forever going to be the four of us.'  Well, then where the meteor was Jerry Yen and Vic Zhou?  'They have other projects,' Vanness repeated.

F4 played to packed houses on Friday and Saturday nights.  Megawati's daughter, Puan Maharani, booked 30 seats and showed up with a retinue of presidential bodyguards, organizers said.  But singers Ken Zhu, Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou and Vanness Wu forgot some of the lyrics and strained their voices when performing mostly Western and Taiwanese pop songs, the Jakarta Post reported.   Observers have touted F4 as an example of the changing tastes of thousands of Asians, who are growing tired of Western teen stars.  The band members also star in a popular Taiwanese soap opera, "Meteor Garden," which depicts a high school romance between a poor girl and a member of a gang of spoiled rich kids.  The series has been a success across East Asia, drawing large audiences in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan.  Television stations in eastern and central China also started showing it last year, but quickly pulled it off the air, claiming it was a corrupting influence on young people.  -----   urlLink http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200301/06004410.html  MTV Asia  Asian Superstars Confirmed At Awards  January 6, 2003 		  MTV Asia is thrilled to announce that Asian superstars including F4 from Taiwan, Shaan from India and Ella from Malaysia will be performing at the 2003 MTV Asia Awards. They will be sharing the stage with previously announced performers Missy Elliott, Avril Lavigne and Nick Carter at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on January 24, 2003. Hosted by CoCo Lee and Shaggy, the pan-regional awards show is set to stun the audience with a superstar lineup and magical live performances fusing the best of East and West.  Top Asian celebrities adding to the glittering list of presenters include, Aishwarya Rai, David Tao, D2B, He Yao Sun, Ogie Alcasid, Palmy, Parokya Ni Edgar, Regine Velasquez, Silly Fools, Slapshock and Urban Xchange. They join previously announced international presenters Suede, Atomic Kitten and Linkin Park members Chester Bennington and Joe Hahn, with more performers and presenters still to be announced.  F4, Taiwan’s hottest quartet, have been hogging the headlines and capturing hearts across Asia since their Meteor Garden days. Made up of Jerry Yen, Vic Zhou, Ken Zhu and Vanness Wu, F4 has been compared to Japan’s ultra-successful SMAP, and it is not hard to see the connection, with the success of both the band’s collective success, as well as their individual success in the fields of singing and acting. The guys are sure to cause hearts to flutter when they take to the stage at the MTV Asia Awards.  India’s Shaan is a self-taught musician who has never received any formal training, but music must run in his blood as his father is the late renowned composer Manas Mukherjee. Shaan started out as a child singer for ad jingles, but moved on to singing remixes and cover versions when he grew older. Establishing himself as a solo artist was the logical next step, and Shaan proved to be a darling amongst critics and fans alike with his albums and foray into singing for Hindi films.  Favourite Music Artist - Malaysia nominee, Ella will also be kicking up a storm on stage with her performance at the Awards. Ella released her first solo album way back in 1988, winning more and more fans as the years (and albums) went by. She is also the first female artist in Malaysia to secure album sales of more than 350,000 units, and has even secured a spot in the Malaysia Book of Records for Most Albums Sold by a Female Artist. She will no doubt be gathering more fans when she appears at the MTV Asia Awards on January 24th.  Joining the list of presenters is Taiwan’s R&B star, David Tao, who after a hiatus, was back with a roar in 2002 with critically acclaimed album, Black Tangerine. Upping the glam factor of the evening will be Indian actress and former Miss World, Aishwarya Rai who will be presenting an award as well.

Eric Lin/tr. by Bruce Humes January 2003  Page:  071 (excerpts)    (image from  urlLink http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/f/f4.html  )  Stimulated by the entertainment industry in Taiwan and Hong Kong over the last few years, TV series and arts programming in China have developed a flavor all their own. In reality, ever since Teresa Teng in the 1970s, Taiwanese pop culture has been the darling of the China market. Back then, Teresa Teng's sweet songs broke through the Bamboo Curtain; but in today's China where economic reform is a raging fire, how are the Chinese masses getting their information about popular Taiwanese entertainment?  In the 21st century, capitalism is no longer "poison" in China. Instead, it is "good medicine" to help China escape from poverty. Public policy has been redefined to allow "bourgeois" entertainment to obtain certification as "politically correct." The gap between rich and poor continues to exist, but the pursuit of trendiness has become a mass movement. Raised during the "one-child family" era of the 1980s by doting parents who handled them with kid gloves, this generation's values have given them the courage to express their longing for popular entertainment.  My work unit is paying  Changes in China can be seen most clearly in spending on entertainment, particularly for concerts put on by pop stars. Typical ticket prices for concerts at venues such as Beijing's Capital Stadium and the Park Stadium range from 180 to 880 renminbi. Even though tickets for the much-idolized F4 group's concert in Shanghai were selling for a record 2000 renminbi, they were still in short supply.  "For a salaried employee, a sum of more than 800 renminbi is a sizeable amount of money. But there are plenty of people with money in China's large cities," says one Beijing concert agent who would only give his alias, Chen Shan. If you can't afford a ticket personally, then just use company funds. At any rate, the company can claim it as a tax deduction.  Demand for concerts is strong. In order to gain approval from the Ministry of Culture, big cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou exploit all sorts of events, such as the Sprite Music Chart Awards and Channel V Chinese Music Chart Awards, to invite a host of Taiwanese and Hong Kong stars to perform. Other fast-growing cities besides these metropolises are also a major battleground for artists to earn a few bucks and make a name for themselves.  -----   urlLink http://www.sinorama.com.tw/en/search/show_issue.php3?id=200319201062E.TXT&query=F4&page=1&row=2&total=8&scope=2&type=all&sort=desc&MaxResults=50   Taiwanese Satellite TV Firms Joust over Mainland Turf  Eric Lin/tr. by Bruce Humes January 2003 Page:  062 (excerpts)    (image from  urlLink http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/f/f4.html  )  Ever since China flung open its gates to capitalism, demand from a population of more than one-billion Chinese for information and entertainment has become increasingly sharp. Add to that WTO membership, which has hastened the opening of China's markets, and all the big global media groups are casting covetous eyes upon the unlimited business opportunities inherent in this, the "last line of defense" left to the communist authorities. Satellite TV firms in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau are making the most of their shared language and culture, so in comparison to US and European media groups, they are better placed to get a foot in the door. Several Hong Kong TV stations have gradually obtained legal landing rights in some areas, and already possess sizeable audiences. Despite the restrictive political atmosphere reigning between authorities on either side of the Strait, two Taiwanese TV groups-Asia Plus Broadcasting and Eastern Broadcasting-are keen to "do battle for the Central Plains," i.e., the China market.  Sustained by the glow of the "Chinese Entertainment Center," Taiwanese satellite TV professionals are full of optimism about the China market, although they were a step behind in the first skirmish for satellite TV landing rights due to the hostile political atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait. Will the Chinese authorities readily relax their media defensive positions? What is the current state of the TV environment in China? And how can Taiwanese satellite TV groups reorganize and best exploit the resources of Taiwan's entertainment industry to ensure a rosy outlook for themselves in China?  Mid-autumn Shanghai. One gust of cold wind after another seeps in via the passageways. Inside Asia Plus's studio the lights are burning bright, but they barely block the footsteps of the early morning sun. Despite the chill, there is a thick scent of tropical Taiwan in the air as they shoot a variety show, Food Masters of the World. This episode features a quiz about Peking duck. At first a video is played, introducing the cuisines of various places in China. The guests then split into two groups and begin to fill in their answers, and the host occasionally walks to and fro, chatting with them about their recent developments. When the answer is revealed, the victors win the right to dine on the steaming hot, sumptuous dishes on the table.  This program's host and special guests are unknown faces to a Taiwanese audience, but the style of the program and the recording process could lead you into thinking you were in Taipei. Every now and then during an unoccupied moment between scenes, producer Joan Sun from Taiwan reminds the host what he should be saying, while program production center supervisor Liu Chi-ying, also a Taiwanese, moves all about, gazes here and there, and issues orders decisively despite her fatigued look.  "This week Asia Plus's Shanghai studio has major events every day. First there is the press conference for Japan's pop idols, the V6 band, then a series of recording sessions for studio and outdoor shots, and besides everyday work, we have to plan a new program, Dash Around the Globe," says Liu Chi-ying hoarsely. On the weekend for the F4 concert at Shanghai Stadium organized by Asia Plus, from the dress rehearsal to the actual performance, full support must be provided. TV staff at Asia Plus consider themselves "international citizens," who have to bear being separated from the land where they grew up. As China reforms its economy and a Chinese cultural circle is in the process of taking shape, the Chinese want to realize their dream of establishing media of international quality-with two-billion-plus Chinese speakers worldwide as a support base-which can counterbalance that of English-speaking countries.  -----   urlLink http://www.ateneo-celadon.com/chinoy/1f4.htm  Chinoy Magazine Issue 3 Volume 4 January 2003 Chinoy Online    (image from  urlLink http://www.ateneo-celadon.com/chinoy/1f4.htm )  ADMIT IT. You belong to 99% of the population who’s completely hooked on the Taiwanese soap “Meteor Garden” and its gorgeous stars. If not, here’s a crash course on what everybody’s been talking about.  Meteor Garden 101  Based on the popular Japanese animated series “Hana Yori Dango” (literally translated as “Men Are Better Than Flowers”), “Meteor Garden” is about a simple, strong-willed girl from a middle-class family who is enrolled by her parents in an exclusive prep school, in the hopes that she might snag a rich guy. Instead, she clashes with four handsome bullies, played by none other than Taiwan’s hottest male pop group F4, and turns their lives upside down.  Why has “Garden” made such a huge splash here in the Philippines? First of all, it’s the first Chinese drama series to be aired locally, which is a nice change from all those Spanish telenovelas. Second, the dubbing in Filipino seems more believable, as the stars all have Asian features. Third, the plot contains the quintessential love triangle that leaves the viewers in a pinch as to who should end up with whom. Fourth, starry-eyed viewers like the Cinderella aspect in the plot, wherein poor girl meets rich guy, and they all live happily ever after. (Or do they?) And fifth, its gorgeous stars. Need I say more?  Cast of heartthrobs  “Garden” boasts of an extraordinary cast of pop icons whose good looks can reduce grown women—and men—to mere puddles of mush. 26-year-old (yes, you read it correctly) Barbie Xu, who’s one-half of the sister pop duo SOS, takes on the role of 19-year-old heroine San Cai. Spunky and headstrong, San Cai defiantly holds her own against rich snobs and ends up winning the hearts of two of the hunkiest guys in school, Dao Ming Si and Hua Zhe Lei.  Dao Ming Si, played by Jerry Yan, is the wealthy, bad-boy leader of the notorious Flower Four. With a temper to match his fiery sex appeal, none dared cross paths with him until San Cai stands up to him and his group. Judging from the smitten reactions of viewers, it appears that 26-year-old Jerry is the resident heartthrob.  Vic Zhou plays the shy charmer Hua Zhe Lei. Quiet and unassuming, he is secretly the one who holds San Cai’s true affections, which brings him at odds with Dao Ming Si. The youngest at 22, Vic is known to his screaming gaggle of fans as Zai Zai, which is a nickname his grandmother had given him. He used to study Engineering before he got drafted as a member of F4.  The indomitable playboy Xi Men, played by 24-year-old Ken Zhu, is the cool, calm and collected member of the quartet. Xi Men’s philosophy is rooted in the belief that every woman becomes uninteresting a week after he gets to know her, so he shies away from long-term relationships. Although born in Taiwan, Ken has lived in Singapore for eight years and, like Vanness, can speak English well.  And last but not the least, Vanness Wu plays the smooth talker Mei Zhuo, whose happy-go-lucky personality adds a touch of humor to the show. Vanness has lived most of his 24 years in Los Angeles, California, which explains his flawless English. With his irritatingly gorgeous hair, he is the easiest to recognize among the four.  F4’s meteoric rise to fame  The F4 boys were virtual unknowns before “Garden” pushed them into the spotlight. Ironically, the group was originally formed for the series and not as a vocal pop group. Each of them was handpicked from the thousands who auditioned for the roles of the four big men on campus, dubbed as the Flower Four.  Jerry had actually been in the modeling business before he landed the leading role of Dao Ming Si. Vanness was spotted by the casting agents when he guested in a Taiwanese Sunday TV show. Vic went to the audition only to accompany his friend, but got the plum role of Hua Zhe Lei instead. And finally, Ken was discovered while he was working in a Japanese BBQ restaurant.  The quartet made “Garden” such a huge and instantaneous hit that they caught the attention of Sony. Two chartbusting albums (“Meteor Rain” and “Fantasy 4ever”) and a “Garden” sequel later, the fate of F4 as Taiwan’s newest pin-up gods was sealed, with the Philippine mania instantly rising to a fever pitch.  Spellbound viewers  Not only that, but it seems like the whole of Asia has fallen completely under their spell, and for a darn good reason, too. Their Oriental features are a refreshing alternative to a pop culture mostly dominated by Caucasian “boy bands.”  To date, F4 is the biggest Asian pop act to gain a cult following practically overnight. Critics may argue that they’re just another run-of-the-mill boy band with the same formula as that of their counterparts: wholesome good looks, funky clothes and little talent. But apparently, this formula is exactly what the viewing public wants. And boy, is it ever.     (image from  urlLink http://www.ateneo-celadon.com/chinoy/1f4.htm )

Beating The Drum: The boys from F4 were in Hong Kong the night before last for a "thousand person party" organized by Pepsi. As the name of the party suggests, only one thousand F4 fans were allowed into the event where the boys interacted with the crowd by playing audience participation games.

Moving the mountain to Mohammed, officials from TVB8 were at the event to present F4 with the Best Music Group Gold Award. Accepting on behalf of the band, Vanness Wu Jian-Hao said: "Thank you to TVB8 for giving us this honour."    (Image courtesy of The Sun.)

Eric Lin/photos by Jimmy Lin/tr. by Jonathan Barnard December 2002 Page:  068    The boys of F-4 have rocketed to stardom in the Chinese-speaking world through the vehicle of the TV serial Meteor Garden. The photo was taken at their concert in Shanghai in November. (image from  urlLink http://www.sinorama.com.tw/en/search/show_issue.php3?id=2002129112068E.TXT&query=F4&page=1&row=5&total=8&scope=2&type=all&sort=desc&MaxResults=50 )  If you believe that manufacturing pop culture idols is a mark of the prowess and influence of a nation's entertainment industry, then Taiwan is looking to be pretty powerful here at the beginning of the 21st century.  In just one summer the boy band F4 has at lightning speed captivated the hearts and minds of teenage boys and girls throughout the global Chinese community. This fall, the sequel to the band's first television series "Meteor Garden" and the band's Asia concert tour have further pushed F4 to the top of the pop heap. As a result, the state of the Chinese entertainment market has become clearer than ever, and it is Taiwan that is leading the game.  Due to its political system and cultural environment, Taiwan's pop culture has been leading mainland China's entertainment industry for decades. In cross-strait cultural exchange, it is Taiwan at the vanguard of the Chinese people. "Made in Taiwan" is a virtually a guarantee of success in the PRC, and the island's show biz types have been making for the mainland in a steady stream. Singers and actors who are has-beens in Taiwan are able to extend their careers there.  Apart from the film industry, which has been slumping on both sides of the strait, Taiwan's entertainment industry-including television production companies, the recording industry, agents and concert promoters-have all crossed over to the PRC market. What's more, a crew shooting a dramatic series in China typically includes Chinese staff from Taiwan, Hong Kong, the mainland, US, Singapore and Thailand.  With respect to cultural exchange, this is all good and well. But in show business, profit is still the number one consideration. The PRC authorities know that the entertainment industry is both leading the minds of the public and making profits. To protect the development of the local entertainment industry, it put a cap on the investment from Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2000.  While Taiwan's entertainment industry seems to be doing very well in mainland China, there is now a limit to the number of Taiwanese actors and actresses allowed to appear in a TV drama. Furthermore, a Taiwanese production company's name can't appear in the credits, it's hard for singers to get included in concert lineups, TV variety shows are only allowed to have Taiwan and Hong Kong artists four times a year.... In two short years, the power has shifted: the highest paid actor is no long Taiwanese, TV series produced by Taiwan producers are dominated by mainland actors, and concert tours by Taiwanese singers risk being banned at anytime. People in the Taiwanese entertainment industry, who once had great influence in the mainland market, now worry about being "Hong Kongized."  How is it that Taiwan, with a total potential audience of only 20 million, can affect the business opportunities that involve a billion-plus people in Mainland China? As the greater environment is changing, can Taiwan's entertainment industry still dominate the field? What will be the profit base of the future?  Deep into autumn, before the Chinese Communist Party's 16th National Congress, a cold front brought frigid air to Beijing's streets two weeks early. Changan Street, though deserted, possessed a palpable feeling of unrest. Tiananmen Square had been recently planted with lush tropical betel nut trees that looked strangely out of place that far north. Red lanterns were hung up on both sides of the road. Slogans wishing the national congress success were hung everywhere, forming an interesting contrast to the brilliant smiles on the faces of F4 in the Pepsi ads, which were equally ubiquitous.  Long before the party congress, China Central Television had started to "purify the people." One heard nothing but patriotic songs on the variety shows. In game shows, the participating teams cheered their teammates on with slogans such as "insisting on the leadership of the party" or "supporting the 'three resolves.'"  All Taiwanese and Hong Kong TV series were banned during this period. All performances and dramas under review were laid aside. Though designated a "national production," the TV series City Ladies, which was co-produced by Taiwan TV drama producer Wu Tsung-te and China International Television Corporation, has been put on hold for a year since it was finished because it depicts urban love stories. It was considered "too frivolous" to be broadcast during the party congress. Wu, worried that it will grow completely stale, has disregarded his mainland partner's opposition and decided to air it in Taiwan first.  "This happens whenever there is a party congress," explains a senior entertainment reporter for a Beijing newspaper. "Everyone's got to march to the beat of the same drum.'"   A concert under the flag  In the southern city Shanghai there was unrest of a distinctly different nature.  A few days before November 9, groups of teenage girls started to check into hotels near Shanghai Stadium. With accents of different provinces, these girls, wearing the badges and flags of F4 pinned all over their clothing, could be found in hotel elevators and lobbies having heated discussions about strategy: How could they go about seeing their idols face to face on the day of the concert; or how could they sneak backstage before the concert in order to "bump into them"?  They fell into distinctly different groups, each supporting a different idol, and each joining a fan club for their specific age range. They chased the stars with no less "expertise" or "intensity" than shown by fans in more advanced Asian cities such as Taipei, Hong Kong and Tokyo.  Just as Beijing was abuzz with whispers about who was going to be the next national leader, the excitement in Shanghai also reached its crescendo.  On the night of the concert, nearly 80,000 fans packed Shanghai Stadium. The some 3,000 public security officers and People's Liberation Army soldiers present couldn't suppress their enthusiasm. There were a few songs the band led the entire audience in singing together, and the screaming voices of 80,000 people echoed loudly in the stadium. The entire audience stood on their chairs despite the efforts of the public security officers to restrain them-all just to see these four big boys from Taiwan. From all the excitement, some fans collapsed into sobbing fits.  Miss Chen, who came all the way from Beijing and sat in the priciest area, said, "Two thousand yuan is not at all expensive. Seeing Zai Zai (Chou Yu-min) with your own eyes is to die for." When asked if she knew that the 16th CPC National Congress was in session, she shrugged and said not to ask her such questions. But she could tell you all about the latest news on F4.  "This is Shanghai," says the senior Beijing entertainment reporter. "In Beijing, it would be impossible to have this kind of big concert within months of the 16th Party Congress."  You can see that in the PRC, even in the entertainment market-which is treated most liberally-people look for political associations. Even though you would expect Beijing and Shanghai to be on different wavelengths, the fact that the F4 concert could be held in Shanghai during the party congress has still caused endless speculation in entertainment circles on both sides of the strait.  Low-key enthusiasm  It took delicate behind-the-scenes maneuvers to give tens of thousands of fans such a great time. The reason that the F4 concert could be held at this politically sensitive moment was that the performance was part of Shanghai's International Arts Festival, which also included performances of symphonies, Peking Opera and ballets. Only some 10 reporters were permitted into the concert. What's more, only reporters from three media outlets from Hong Kong and Taiwan were allowed in, and they were unexpectedly given only a few minutes for photos. Even Chiang Yi-peng, F4's agent, was forbidden to go in by order of security.  In this special political climate, the promotion of the concert was low key. There was minimal advertising, and the promoters were often uncooperative with media. This is hardly a typical way to run a concert for a teeny bopper band. Nevertheless, the F4 concert was an unprecedented success and set the record for the highest ticket price of a single concert in mainland China.  "The pop cultures on both sides of the strait have long been in tune with each other," said Angie Chai, also an agent for F4, explaining why F4 could become so hot in Chinese communities around the world without promotion in the largest single market, mainland China. She says that currently the entertainment center for all Chinese-speaking regions is still Taipei, and Taipei's satellite TV broadcast stations are especially well developed. As a result, any place that a satellite can reach, people only have to set up a dish to receive the first-hand entertainment news from Taipei. In addition, rampant pirating in the PRC makes DVDs of "Meteor Garden" readily available even if the album was banned.  "Fans were able to watch F4's television series, see the news about them and hear their songs, but they couldn't see them in the flesh," said Sammy Yang, the managing director and president of Asia Plus, who organized this concert. "So the fans looked forward to the concert for a whole year, and naturally it pushed their popularity to the highest level."     An internationally known cola company believes that Taiwan idols can attract young mainland consumers. This ad featuring F4 can be seen everywhere in major cities in the PRC. (image from  urlLink http://www.sinorama.com.tw/en/search/show_issue.php3?id=2002129112068E.TXT&query=F4&page=1&row=5&total=8&scope=2&type=all&sort=desc&MaxResults=50 )  Music comes after food  Apart from lagging behind in production and mixing techniques, China is also unable to "create" teenybopper idol singers, the most important link in the chain of recording industry success.  That Beijing reporter notes that in the 1980s, when the "Little Tigers" became popular in China, Chinese record companies started to try to create their own teeny bopper idol bands. But so far the "Heartbeat Boys B.O.B" and "Power of China" have not met with the same popularity as Korea's H.O.T., Japan's V6, and Taiwan's F4 and Su Yu-peng.  Agent Chen Shih-long explains that performers of this type are products of well-fed and well-clad societies. Apart from requiring mature packaging and operating methods, the aura of these performers has something to do with the environment that they grew up in, and it cannot be imposed upon them. Taiwan is an open society, and information here circulates fast, so that young kids here are confident that they are at the cutting edge of fashion. Their aura is naturally different from kids in mainland China.  Chen Shih-long has gone to China for his business as an agent for years, but he has not yet seen any kids there with potential. "Although the market there is big and there is no lack of capital, Taiwan's entertainment industry has deep roots. With pop idol singers leading the way, there will be no problem leading the Chinese-language market for several more years."  The success of F4 is the result of the integration of drama, television, celebrity management, and recording in Taiwan, which in turn points to the great foundations of Taiwan's entertainment industry. Although there has been a talent and technical drain, Taiwan still has what it takes for success.  Jessie Ho cites the example of Hong Kong, which long ago lost its leading status. Despite its small market and the predominance of the Cantonese dialect, it is still powerful in the pop industry. For example, the teenage girl band Twins, whose albums have never sold more than 10,000 and some odd copies in Hong Kong, is poised to conquer other areas thanks to the recording industry, agents and the media.  "That's how it is in this field-you can shop around to find where the market is," Ho argues. "Isn't it true that all of Asia now is the hinterland of Japan and Korea's entertainment industry?"  Sammy Yang, the managing director and president of Asia Plus, who has run entertainment companies in the US, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China, says that "fashion" is a matter of mutual stimulation. Taiwan's pop culture has helped bring China to a place that is more open and diverse. Today, Taiwan's entertainment industry needs the bigger market and human resources of the PRC to bring it past the bottleneck of the wilted domestic market.  There is no absolute gain and loss in the process of exchange. Influenced by culture, business and politics, the entertainment industry is charmingly always in flux. Thus, after A-mei was banned in the PRC for two years, her voice got a good rest, so that it has returned to the resonant and moving voice she had when she first emerged. As for the obstacles and misunderstandings that have cropped up in the cross-strait exchange of pop culture, one can-if one is looking for the silver lining-see these   problems as necessary parts of the process of understanding each other.  -----   href="http://www.sinorama.com.tw/en/search/show_issue.php3?id=2002129112002E.TXT&query=F4&page=1&row=4&total=8&scope=2&type=all&sort=desc&MaxResults=50">http://www.sinorama.com.tw/en/search/show_issue.php3?id=2002129112002E.TXT&query=F4&page=1&row=4&total=8&scope=2&type=all&sort=desc&MaxResults=50  Tender Loving Care  Chang Chin-ju/tr. by Robert Taylor December 2002 Page:  002 (excerpts)  In mid-November, a Sinorama reporter visited the set where Taiwanese TV producer Young Pei-pei was filming in Suzhou, and was also the only reporter from Taiwan to attend a concert by the Taiwanese group F4 in Beijing. In that land that on the surface appears increasingly open, but where the political barriers have not yet come down and there are still many taboos and ideologically sensitive subjects, how can people from Taiwan's film and entertainment world cut a path for themselves?

This rumor has been going on for some time now. There’s gossip going around that the Taiwanese boy band is on the verge of breaking up and this would inevitably lead to cancellation of shows.  But earlier this week on November 18, AJ Promosindo -- F4’s promoter and concert organizer in Jakarta -- released an announcement that said that the Bali Tragedy will not affect the scheduled performance of F4 in Jakarta next January 10 and 11. They also cleared up the break up gossip regarding Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou, Ken Zhu and Vanness Wu. The group is very much still together.  AJ Pro added that the F4 management teams in Hong Kong and Singapore are still busy with all preparation needed for the Jakarta concert, including security matters.  That is great news for F4 fans in Jakarta who are waiting very patiently for the promised spectacular show in January. Meanwhile their latest flick Meteor Garden 2 is about to air on Indosiar TV Station next week!  -- Nadia M.

Among those honored were Angie Chai, the producer of popular TV programs for Taiwan Television Enterprise, and Terry Kuo, director of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., garnering the awards for innovation and for entrepreneurship respectively. Via the dramas that she produces, Chai's accomplishments in the Chinese-language entertainment industry have swept through Taiwan, earning her respect in both the Asian market and the international media.  From the variety show Super Sunday, which won Golden Bell Awards three years running and has boasted phenomenal ratings for many years, to the teen-idol show Meteor Garden that ignited the F-4 craze in Asia, Chai has opened new possibilities for Taiwan's televised dramas in her 16-plus years in the business. As she approaches middle age, not only has she managed to preserve the appearance of a young beauty in her twenties, but her creativity and sensitivity to the workings of popular culture are second to none in the Chinese-language entertainment world.  Born and raised in Taiwan, Chai has been described by the media as the "TV's most beautiful producer," and praised by her colleagues as a "superwoman." But just what kind of person is she, and what is the source of her endless creativity and dedication?  A year and half ago, Chai left a steady job as the producer of the variety show Super Sunday to produce a new kind of "teen-idol" show, Meteor Garden. The media's reaction to her departure was less than favorable, with some even declaring disparagingly that she had crept away, her creativity sucked dry. But Chai remained indifferent to the criticism, secure in the knowledge that she had in fact left of her own volition.   "Over ten years in the entertainment world have made it clear to me that chance and creativity are the biggest factors in success," avers Chai. Recognizing that creativity endures but chance is fleeting, when opportunity knocked she took the bull by the horns, seizing that which could potentially take her life to the next level.  The glimmer of opportunity  Here's the scoop on how Angie Chai broke out of the variety show circuit to become a producer of TV dramas.  Her employer at the time was producing shows for the 9:30 p.m. slot on Wednesdays and Thursdays for Chinese Television System. As the shows were plagued by poor viewer ratings, CTS was in favor of canning them and allowing another company to produce new shows to replace them. Chai was asked to plead with the CTS director.  "You've had your chance. If ratings are continually low then it stands to reason we should let some other folks have a go at it," said the station director unsympathetically.  "Well, how about letting me personally produce a replacement program? I'm sure you all can trust me on this, right?" Chai exclaimed excitedly.   "Hmm, well if you're going to be in charge, then I'm sure there's nothing to be worried about," replied the director with a smile and then said no more.  Chai had figured that the director was merely being polite and was surprised when CTS's programs division called her up not long afterward to ask, "Why haven't we received your proposal for the new show?" Only then did she realize that her suggestion had indeed been taken on face value.   "Back then CTS's Wednesday program was a variety show, and Thursday was drama night. Someone else was covering the Wednesday show, so I had a chance to try my hand at something entirely new," she comments. Due to the confines of a busy schedule, she had no recourse but to step down from her position as the producer of Super Sunday.  Out of the ordinary  As Chai made her transition from variety shows to drama, many in the dog-eat-dog world of entertainment regarded her with interest, no doubt musing to themselves, "Just what kind of program is this variety show woman going to put on, anyhow?"  Chai states that her experience with variety shows helped her become finely attuned to the world of popular culture. By analyzing the overall composition of TV audiences in Taiwan at that time, she ascertained that adolescents comprises the largest viewing group; however, few shows were specifically targeted at this youthful audience. In addition, no new male teen-idol groups had emerged since the Little Tigers, forcing Taiwan teens to redirect their youthful affection to groups in Japan and Hong Kong.  As a result, devising a program for Taiwan youth and creating a new teen-idol group became the twin focal points of Chai's new production. She decided upon Meteor Garden, a Japanese comic that, in addition to possessing all the ingredients necessary to achieving her goals, was furthermore the most frequently rented book in Taiwan's book lending stores. After securing authorization from the Japanese owners, she adapted the script and found actors who were suited to portray the members of F4, the group of Adonises that are the show's main characters. With everything set to go, they began shooting right away.   "The story has to be believable, but you can take liberties with the setting. That's the appeal of TV drama," maintains Chai. With this in mind, she didn't bother to convert the Japanese names that the main characters had in the original comic, which provided an exotic tinge. The comic book feel was also preserved in the show's lighthearted style.   Switching entertainment genres gave her the advantage of a new perspective. Moreover, she could still rely on the contacts she had developed while working on variety shows. For instance, when a limited budget made developing original theme music impossible, she was able to call upon her old network of colleagues at a record company to obtain music free of charge, so long as she agreed to a reduced percentage on the soundtrack sales. At first the record company were cautious at Chai's unorthodox approach; but in the end the outstanding performance of the show and the soundtrack left both parties thoroughly satisfied.  Nevertheless, the unfamiliarity of TV drama provided its share of headaches.  Generally speaking, variety shows in Taiwan are generously financed for the first couple of shows in the hope of making a stir, thereby attracting a large audience. Afterwards, the budget is then gradually cut back. Chai had already settled on this kind of format; little did she realize that producing a TV drama was a whole new ball of wax-you simply can't start off strong for the first couple of episodes and then let things slide.  "We depleted almost half our total budget just making the first five episodes. In the end there was nothing I could do but pay the difference out of my own pocket, and console myself with the fact that I could always make some money by selling rights to the show overseas," she recalls. CTS had allotted NT$700,000 per episode, but Chai had to spend an average of NT$1 million.  "Making a teen-idol group show is about presenting an image," declares Chai. Her work philosophy consists of trying to create something that she would want to watch herself-ultimately people should be attempting to surpass themselves, otherwise what's the point of working so hard in the first place?  The price of success   For some, this kind of transition would be a hassle, but Chai has continued to reap benefits.  "I really dig this line of work, so I'm enthusiastic about everything," she says.  A graduate of Chinese Culture University's Drama Department, Chai's enthusiasm has brought her success, a step at a time. Her first job was as a scriptwriter for soft-core adult films. Later she joined a production company for which she was writer and executive producer for the variety show The Diamond Stage, and produced a host of other variety shows such as A Good Omen, Weekend Fireworks, Weekend Studio, and Super Sunday. Now manager of a teen-idol group and widely acknowledged as a first-rate producer, Chai epitomizes the experience of those in the TV industry who have climbed the ladder of success one rung at a time.   She believes that in the mercurial world of film and television, in addition to being enthusiastic, one must also constantly and ungrudgingly seek self-improvement. Without any how-to guides to refer to, one is therefore compelled to make use of one's imagination and powers of observation.  "I'm the kind of person who likes to have a good time, and for me, my work is just like playing video games. There are plenty of challenges to overcome, but you're having so much fun in the process that you just can't stop playing," she says, referring to the kind of mentality that allows her to find so much joy in her work. For instance, during the time that she was working on variety shows, in order to improve her ability to write clipped, witty dialogue, she went out and purchased the complete recordings of crosstalk comic dialogue masters, Wei Lung-hao and Wu Chao-nan. She listened to the recordings everyday and studied them assiduously.   "In addition to studying, I was able to crack up at the performance of these cross-talk masters," Chai says, fondly recalling the experience.   Looking back on things, there was a mix of hardship and pleasure. The joy derived from the sense of accomplishment in the finer points of the work, and the headaches were brought on by endless days and nights of labor, and by all the small nuisances and frustrations that surface in the workplace.  Chai is one of the few beauties behind the scenes, and in the male-controlled industries of film and television, sexual harassment is an obstacle that a beautiful woman cannot entirely avoid.  While producing variety shows, Chai experienced a brush with harassment. One of the station's male directors had taken a fancy to her, which at first manfested itself as late night telephone calls and unexpected visits to the film studio. One late night while she was still in the middle of a shoot, the director asked her to step outside to chat.  The two of them made their way over to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and in the darkness, Chai felt a creepy sensation settle over her. The director finally said, "Things between men and women needn't be so restrained. When there's something there, people ought to just go ahead and savor the moment."  The quick-witted Chai wanted to give him a severe tongue-lashing, but was worried about potential repercussions in the workplace, so, in a burst of inspiration she countered, "I take matters of love very seriously and am quite possessive! When I have my heart set on somebody, if I can't have him, than I would rather that we both die!"   Her comments struck fear into the heart of this Don Juan, and he didn't pursue matters further.  Nowadays, harassment within the workplace has subsided, only to be replaced by a new nuisance: the prying public, which has taken an interest in many facets of the beautiful producer's life, from her marital status, to her love life, to her financial habits. To be more specific, her picture has appeared in the tabloids just as frequently as the members of her teen-idol group. As far as the prying eye of the public is concerned, she says nonchalantly, "After all this time in the field, there's nothing new about any of it. Even more important than remaining cool in the face of public gossip and comments is that no matter what else you do, you have to be true to yourself."  Not just a flash in the pan  Many attribute Chai's successful transition to blind luck, regarding the rise of F4 as yet another flash in the pan. However, Nien Chang-yu, senior entertainment reporter for the United Daily News, feels that Chai's uncanny success is a result of "feminine grace, discretion and good judgement, and accurate information."   Chai holds that being acutely aware of the popular culture atmosphere and understanding the needs of youth are supremely important. For instance, in selecting actors for F4, she felt that acting skill was subordinate to star-like charisma and presence.   "A teen-idol group exists to satiate people's fantasies," she says. Accordingly, from the very get-go she established physical criteria for prospective F4 candidates: a minimum height requirement of 180 cm and exceptionally handsome features.   A peculiar aspect of Taiwan TV and film is the tendency to exploit new ideas to the point of exhaustion. Following the success of Meteor Garden, 50 teen-idol dramas have been filmed. "It's hard to blaze any new paths in the Chinese-language market with the teen-idol drama. I would like to be able to control a certain percentage of the market output; that way I could at least vouch for the quality of a certain amount of the shows," confides Chai. Her plan for the next year is to shoot over 200 hours of footage, which translates into at least ten shows.   "I'm not saying that my own shows are necessarily superior to others, it's just that sticking around in this business makes you develop a sense of mission. Just take a look at how in Korea the industry has the support of the entire state apparatus, and how rigorously they market their entertainment industry abroad. Things in Taiwan, on the other hand, look bleaker all the time," she observes. The filmmaking environment in Taiwan is such that even a 40-episode 8:00 p.m. serial has to begin slashing the budget within three months. Under such conditions, how can one make a decent show?   Accordingly, Chai feels that she has to take an active role in improving show quality, cultivating new directors and actors. To this end she channels her earnings into making new shows. "At any rate, I've been in the biz this long, so the thing to do is to keep at it. You've got to think of the big picture-first concentrate on quality, and the money will come in time," she says.   Now, Chai's sundry roles as TV show writer, director, producer, and manager of teen-idol actors have gradually crystallized into a composite career. What especially amazes people is that, after leading the male idol group F4 to fame, she has followed the model of the Japanese idol group Johnny's Studio and established a teen-idol incubator, Comic Kids, through which she can produce her own core of stars-to-be.  "The focus of Johnny's is on cultivating stars, whereas I'm more concerned with the show itself," avers Chai. Although many recording stars have appeared on the show, she's able to exert more control when she can handle developing a core of actors herself. As to whether playing the role of a manager causes her to spread herself too thin, it's not her major concern-she's even gone as far as to delegate part of the responsibility of managing F4 to other people.   Beauty is forever  Though she has a radiant appearance and finds pleasure in her work, during many excruciating nights as a superwoman producer she has shut the door, overwhelmed by self-doubt. Especially during the time when Meteor Garden was all the rage, every day was an endless stream of announcements and invitations. Severely sleep-deprived, Chai had thought to herself: as a worker behind the scenes, I'll never be any more famous than I am now, and besides, I really don't make as much money as people think, so what's the point of spending my youth slaving away like this?  Around that time she received a letter. A mother wrote in to thank her for producing Meteor Garden. This particular fan's autistic son had never spoken before, but when Meteor Garden appeared on TV each day he ecstatically called out the names of its stars.  "Even though his first utterance wasn't 'Mama,' it was as important to me as if it had been," read one part of the letter.   After Chai read the letter, all her self-doubt was dispelled instantly; it turned out after all that in this cold and desolate world, a person's work is nonetheless capable of bringing warmth to the hearts of others.   "Enthusiasm, 100% pure, unmitigated enthusiasm is my approach to work," says Chai. No matter what circumstances she encounters that may make her feel upset or ambivalent, she'll keep on smiling and being the beautiful, confident woman she is.  -----   href="http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/august/0827to0829/0827.html">http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/august/0827to0829/0827.html  Fluff August 27, 2002 (excerpts)  In television ratings news, ATV's broadcast of F4's Taiwanese television drama, METEOR GARDEN, has not been as successful as ATV hoped but it has improved ratings for ATV's prime time schedule. Last week, three of ATV's prime-time programmes broke double-digits in the ratings. Leading off the night, WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE garnered an average of 11 ratings points.

Will their flowing hair and chiseled jaws finally wear off? Or, is it possible that might show some true talent and last longer in the business than anyone would have thought?  Let's put off all these questions and just see if they can maintain their popularity for the next five months, because that is when the foursome is expected in Jakarta for a concert.  After the rumors had flown about for some time about F4's eventual arrival here, it was finally confirmed that Jerry Yan, Vic Zhou, Ken Zhu and Vanness Wu will perform here on Jan. 10 and Jan. 11 next year.  The venue is massive -- the Jakarta Fairground in Kemayoran, Central Jakarta, about 44 hectares big. The audience is expected to be enormous as well, about 70,000 people for the two concerts.  And the ticket prices are equally whopping: Rp 200,000, Rp 500,000, Rp 1 million or Rp 2 million, depending on which class you prefer.  "They (F4) are now very much in demand. They have a huge legion of fans here. People are already very enthusiastic and are ordering the tickets," promoter Jeddy Suherman of AJ Promo said during a media conference on Thursday.  "F4 has a very tight schedule, so we could only get them next January," said Jeddy, the father of child sensation Joshua Suherman.  After taken Asia by storm with the TV series Meteor Garden, the boyband is indeed in demand, with concerts, a few other TV series (including Meteor Garden 2) and solo albums.  According to Jeddy, it was a struggle to get the deal for the two Jakarta concerts. Even more of a struggle than when going after European and American acts, he said.  For some reason, the boyband's management had not originally included Indonesia on the list of concert dates.  So Jeddy approached Singapore agency Peter Loh Production Associates, the authorized promoter of an F4 concert in Singapore.  AJ Promo got the deal, as long as the production and equipment is handled and brought from Singapore.  "That was the requirement set (by the F4 management). The equipment and the production from Singapore meet their standards. It's not that locals are bad, though. We use 50 percent local stuff," said Peter Loh, adding that the boyband would also bring some 100 of their own crewmembers for the concerts here.  The promoter picked the venue for its size, which allows for holding a concert on a grand scale. As for security, AJ Promo is collaborating with Renny Djajoesman Enterprises as a copromoter.  Tickets will soon be available, but they will not be your average ticket. Purchasers will receive a credit card-like ticket along with a bar code, to avoid fraud.  So, you still want to see F4?

A year and a half ago, she was toiling away at a Taiwanese production company that made run-of-the-mill variety shows. Then she managed to convince a local network that it should take a chance on something new: a miniseries, based on a Japanese comic book, that tracks the lives and loves of a group of affluent Taipei high school students.  It was one of the first youth-oriented dramas ever to be shown on Taiwanese TV. ``If we did a show that young people would watch, then I thought maybe we would have a chance,'' she explains. The gamble paid off. Since its debut last year, Meteor Garden has been hot. Following its run last spring on Taiwan network TV, the show has spawned a slew of copycat dramas. And Meteor Garden's quartet of cute stars has gone on to create F4, a wildly popular boy band.  Meteor Garden has also sizzled in Southeast Asia and China, where it has touched a nerve among teenagers. Indeed, Beijing's censors recently banned Meteor Garden for promoting unhealthy attitudes--based on its occasional violence and ubiquitous materialism. ``It is believed that the serial will mislead and have a bad influence on young people,'' explained China Daily, Beijing's English-language mouthpiece. In particular, the paper decried the show for promoting ``an updated version of hippiedom'' while also glorifying ``money worship.''  Chai isn't too worried about her communist critics. ``They just don't want too many fans to become crazy for those four boys,'' she says, defending the show and its contents as wholesome. She's now hard at work on the sequel to Meteor Garden, in which the show's leading actress will travel to Barcelona, Spain, for fun and adventure after graduation. Chai has formed her own production company, Comic Ritz Productions, and hired Hou Hsiao-hsien--Taiwan's most honored filmmaker--to be executive producer of the show.  Meanwhile, she is also talking to investors about backing other innovative television shows--none of them clones of Meteor Garden--and plans to hire talented young directors to help her. ``Maybe we'll do some experiments,'' she muses. Whatever China's stuffy censors say, millions of Asian teenagers are looking forward to Angie Chai's next act.   -----   href="http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/july/0703to0705/0705.html">http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/july/0703to0705/0705.html  Fluff July 5, 2002 (excerpts)  Currently, Aaron Kwok Fu-Sing is being featured along with Sammi Cheng Sau-Man, F4 and Jay Chow Kit-Lun in Pepsi's summer ad campaign.

Tse, who was still wearing a neck brace, did not speak to reporters and traveled only to and from the studio and his hotel. As he did not have any scenes with rumoured girlfriend Cecilia Cheung, the two did not spend any time on the set together. However, it is believed that they were able to spend some time together as Coca-Cola arranged for them to stay in the same hotel.  Apart from a few bumps and bruises, Tse appears to be largely unaffected by his car accident. However, his injuries did a force a change in the Coke commercial. Originally he was supposed to shoot a scene in the water but that has now been changed due to his tender condition. As a result, the only stars on location in the water the day before yesterday were the girl group Twins and Taiwan's second most popular boy band WeWe. F4, of course, is Taiwan's most popular boy band.   -----   href="http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/june/0622to0623/0622.html">http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/june/0622to0623/0622.html  Fluff June 22, 2002 (excerpts)  The already over-saturated HK music awards scene got even more meaningless last night as Metro Radio presented its "Mandarin Music Awards 2002".

A day after bandmate Ken Zhu Xiao-Tian left Hong Kong, F4's Vic Zhou Yu-Min arrived to record a guest appearance for a TVB charity benefit. Like all previous visits by F4 and its members, over three hundred fans waited at the airport to greet Zhou. So, just how popular is F4 in Hong Kong? When Zhou made his way to TVB Studios, reporters kept their focus on Zhou and ignored frequent centre-of-attention Nicolas Tse Ting-Feng.   -----   href="http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/may/0525to0527/0525to0526.html">http://www.hkentreview.com/2002/may/0525to0527/0525to0526.html  Fluff May 26, 2002 (excerpts)  Yesterday, after a marathon day long shooting session the day before for the video for Gigi Leung Wing-Kei's new song FA PING GAI TONG (lit.

The event endured some criticism from Hong Kong educators as many young girls, the core of F4's fan base, skipped school in order to wait in line to meet their idol. Some of the girls had been in line for over ten days. Responding to the dedication, Yan said: "I know that some of the fans waited for over ten days. I was really worried about them sitting outside like that in the sun and the rain. I'm really sorry that they had to go through that. If I could, I would have waited along with them."  Further, Yan went on to deny two rumours: that F4's manager takes a 90% commission and that their is dissension in the ranks of the band. Yan: "The four of us get along really well. From the time we made METEOR GARDEN as nobodies to now -- when we have everyone's attention -- we have shared experiences that no one else can understand.

And the guys are true to the genre: all looks, no talent    BY DAVENA MOK  Monday, Apr. 15, 2002   src="http://a740.g.akamai.net/f/740/606/1d/image.pathfinder.com/time/asia/magazine/2002/0422/f4.jpg"> (Image from  href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501020422-230455,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501020422-230455,00.html )  Arrested by Taiwanese coastal police last month while trying to sneak across from the Chinese mainland, Lu Jing had only one question: "Is Zai Zai in Kaohsiung?" And with that one simple query, the 22-year-old from Fujian province became the unofficial No. 1 F4 fan.   Zai's real name is Vic Zhou, and he is one of the four members of the Taiwanese acting-singing sensation F4 that is rapidly building an Asia-wide following. O.K., so the guys can't really act. Or sing. And they can barely dance. But they're a boy group, for chrisakes: Zhou, Vanness Wu, Jerry Yen and Ken Zhu are only required to have nice smiles, hot bodies and fantastic hair. These things they have in spades—and not a tattoo or pierced body part among them. In Taiwan, these squeaky clean little love boys are being held up as model spouses. If that sounds absurd, remember that this is a place where 93% of couples say they are unhappy in matrimony and 34% of marriages end in divorce. "F4 are so popular because women cannot find romance in real life," says Angie Chai, general manager of Comic Productions and creator of F4.   The boys leapt into the limelight last April with the launch of the show Meteor Garden on Taiwan's Chinese Television System. Women of all ages gushed over the romantic tale of a poor girl hooking up with a member of a rich brat-bully pack at an élite Taipei high school. (Mainland Chinese authorities were less enamored, saying it misled young viewers; Beijing recently banned the show after a few episodes aired on some local television stations.) The TV plot was adapted from a Japanese manga comic called Hana Yori Dango (Men Are Better Than Flowers). Chai, a variety-show producer, handpicked the boys from an audition of 200 (minimum qualifications: good looks and a height of 1.8 m) and dubbed them F4, short for the "Flower Four."   The show attracted the attention of Sony Music, which gave the band a three-album deal; the first, Meteor Rain, was released late last year. It was pop-fluff stuff, a sonic fusion of Japanese groups SMAP and Tokio. But Taiwan's teens had not had a local boy band to worship since Little Tigers disbanded a decade ago, and 400,000 copies of Meteor Rain flew off the shelves; it sold more than 1 million Asia-wide. That success was quickly replicated on the mainland, where bootleg copies of the show, album and merchandise hit the streets.   F4 is now on the fast track for boy bands everywhere: each member will have solo albums out, and movie contracts are ready to go. Collectively, they host a TV show, ABCDEF4, and are planning an Asian tour this fall. You have been warned.

After the demise of the Little Tigers and the breakup of LABoyz, there was an "empty nest" period. But today, as boy groups are sweeping the US, Europe, and Japan, a local boy group fever (helped along by TV "idol drama serials") is reaching new peaks in Taiwan as well. The most popular group is F4, which grew directly out of the made-for-TV version of Hana Yori Dango, a popular Japanese comic book series for young girls. But they are not the only ones. B.A.D., formed last year, will release their second album in October, and Tension, led by David Tao, have also been doing quite well. Meanwhile, Lin Yo-wei and Lee Wei, two teenage actors who have made it big on their respective idol drama serials, will make their move into pop music territory as a two-boy team in September.  There is strength in numbers, they say. Now that the boy group craze has gotten a foothold, we can expect one group after another to appear. Where is this wave coming from? Are boy groups really going to be the saviors of Taiwan's ailing recording industry?  On a July weekend, the members of the boy group F4, featured in the "idol drama serial" known in English as Meteor Garden, are having an autograph session in Taipei's Hsinmenting area. Incredibly, thousands of people have shown up, creating a level of fervor that at least equals, if not surpasses, that generated by the Taiwan publicity tour of the Japanese boy group V6. As the crowd presses forward, the stage begins to wobble, and the sponsors have no choice but to abort the event to prevent disaster. Still, more than 20 people are reported to have passed out, and another four are in shock. Many entertainment reporters are moved to declare the return of the super boy group fever that seemed to have receded when the Little Tigers fell out of the public eye.  Idol buffet  Hai Chen is a junior high student, still attending "remedial classes" despite its being summer vacation. Taking advantage of a day off from school, she and her classmates have braved the sweltering heat to jostle for a glance at their idols.  "Even before they announced the cancellation they were already taking the stage apart, so we had an idea what was happening. But we still hung on until the last moment, when they actually announced the cancellation. What a mega-disappointment!" Hai Chen, still in the bloom of youth, reels off the names of her favorite male stars: Nicholas Tse, Andy Liu, Nicky Wu, the Korean boy group H.O.T. It seems she goes for boyish good looks. (Andy Liu, who is the same age as Hai Chen's mom, is the exception, but Hai Chen says she can "live with that" because he is "mega-handsome.")  "Everybody loves F4," she gushes. Though her classmates all have their own favorites among the F4 boys, because they are all in the same band, everybody shares the same obsession in common, says Hai Chen, so there are plenty of things to talk about together.  Music critic Ma Hsin echoes Hai Chen's logic. An ensemble that brings together different images and characteristics is like a "buffet lunch," with "more for your money." "Everything you could wish for, wrapped up in one package" is how she puts it.  What makes F4 so hot? Even when they only existed as a group in a comic book, they were already immensely popular idols. The members had different personalities, such as the low-key and gentle guy, the playboy who is really lonely at heart, and the stubborn yet passionate one. When these four idealized personality types were given form as tangible people (or at least tangible actors), and they rescued the girl in the TV series from poverty, naturally the hearts of young girls in Taiwan never stood a chance. So who cares if these kids can't act?  Market indicator  A more diversified product that offers different types of handsome young guys definitely covers all the bases. That is why, avers Wang Tzu-shou, a music critic for the Min Sheng Daily, boy groups are always a good bet in a slow record market. Especially now, after a long empty-nest period for boy bands in Taiwan, many in the biz are looking to such groups to pull the industry out of the doldrums.  Last year B.A.D. got noticed after performing well in band contests in the US. Mark Liu, former managing director at EMI, the company which has B.A.D. under contract, declared: "I stake my whole reputation, earned through more than ten years in the industry, that if this record doesn't sell, there's no point in making any records at all." And the band has indeed done quite well.  Wang Tzu-shou notes that boy groups are suited to the "roulette wheel" mentality of an industry that is struggling to survive. They are composed almost exclusively of unknowns, so, except for the training fees associated with the earliest stage of popularity, they require little capital input. If a company puts its chips on the right number, the money will come rolling in. There is not even any need to figure out how to organize and run such groups: Taiwan record companies just have to follow in the footsteps of successful precedents from Japan, Europe, and the States. You can see how this works from a short history of boy bands in Taiwan.  In the global groove  The Little Tigers, who came up in the early 1980s, were a copy of Japan's Shonentai in virtually every respect, and even their most popular song was simply the Chinese-language rendering of a Shonentai hit. The formula was pretty simple: clean-cut looks, easy-listening melodies, and a few basic dance steps for the stage.  Next up were the Crickets, composed of guys who danced behind Hong Kong superstar Anita Mui. Their trademarks were a tougher look and driving rhythms, fitting into the dance music fad in late 80s Taiwan. Then the LABoyz, overseas Chinese from the States who came back to Taiwan in the early 90s, followed the trail set by black "break dance" music in the US, and they even went for a "black" feel in their attire and physical appearance.  F4 is a composite, with two Taiwan-born-and-bred members, one who lived in Singapore for quite some time, and one Chinese-American. They look sharp, and have a somewhat foreign feel. When you combine these features with their packaging in an "idol drama serial," you've duplicated the product formula blown in on the wind of Japanese idol TV shows.  "Dream maker" Liu Wei-tsu, agent for both LABoyz and B.A.D., says that F4 marks a significant innovation in terms of the channel used for making the boys into celebrities and also in the fact that the group requires a cooperative effort among different agents. But this approach won't necessarily apply to other boy groups.  "The success of F4 is a matter of being in the right place at the right time with the right people. Not everybody can be so lucky," says Liu. Stardom has to be in your stars, too. If the timing is good, if the record company chooses the right packaging and market niche, and if the managers judge correctly which way the wind is blowing, it's not that difficult to get famous. But pop culture never stands still, and even if you've got all the "manufacturing" techniques down pat, you still need an extremely sensitive nose to pick up the scent of the latest pop trend.  As easy as ABC  So have Taiwan's boy groups had anything special about them compared to those from the US, Europe, and Japan? Wang Tzu-shou doesn't mince words: "Not a thing." But one aspect that seems worth looking at a little more is the popularity of so-called ABCs: American-born Chinese.  "The children who emigrated or who were sent off to be 'little overseas students' in the 1980s have grown up and come back. They are more hip to Western pop culture and speak English well, which are enviable qualities. Now that a few have entered the field, they are sure to bring others in after them," says Wang. But this, he adds, is just a question of background; it doesn't mean a thing when it comes to style.  While many kids are fascinated with boy groups, many adults are obsessed with Hello Kitty. Critic Ma Hsin says that they have something in common: The product itself produces a rush in the consumer, creating a sense of worship and the thrill of collecting. So both older folks who cuddle their stuffed dolls and young girls who gaze enraptured at posters of their idols get a sense of gratification. Hai Chen's mom worries that her daughter's attachment to idols will distort her development, but Hai Chen seems to know what she is doing. Pop stars are just another part of the youth vocabulary, and it's only normal that you need to know something about them to be able to talk with other kids and sing their songs at karaoke.  Boyish good looks will always find admirers. So long as nobody gets the fiction confused with reality, being stuck on pop idols is just an ordinary phase young girls go through. We've all been there, haven't we?

National Anthem   The words of the Republic of China (ROC) national anthem were first delivered as an exhortation at the opening ceremony of the Whampoa Military Academy on June 16, 1924, by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. This exhortation was designated as the Kuomintang's (KMT) party song in 1928, after which the KMT then publicly solicited contributions for a tune to fit the words. The melody submitted by Cheng Mao-yun was the undisputed winner out of 139 contenders.  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Ministry of Education held two separate competitions for lyrics for a national anthem, using the KMT party song in the meantime as a temporary national anthem. None of the entries reviewed by the Ministry of Education were deemed appropriate, so Dr. Sun's composition was finally adopted as the official national anthem of the Republic of China in 1937.  The anthem first declares the Three Principles of the People to be the foundation of the nation and guides to a world commonwealth of peace and harmony; and then calls upon the people to be brave, earnest and constant in striving to fulfill the nation's goals.  The piece was honored as the world's best national anthem at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.   San Min Chu I Our aim shall be to found a free land. World peace be our stand. Lead on, comrades, vanguards ye are. Hold fast your aim, by sun and star. Be earnest and brave, your country to save. One heart, one soul, one mind, one goal!    (image from  urlLink http://www.gov.tw/ENGLISH/ )    (image from  urlLink http://www.gov.tw/ENGLISH/ )   National Flower:   The plum blossom,  prunus mei , was officially designated by the Executive Yuan of the Central Government to be the national flower on July 21, 1964. The plum blossom, which produces shades of pink and white and gives off a delicate fragrance, has great symbolic value for the Chinese people because of its resilence in harsh winter weather. The triple grouping of stamens (one long and two short) represents Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, while the five petals symbolize the five branches of the ROC government.

The Chinese call the island  Taiwan , meaning  terraced bay .  The wild, forested beauty of the island led Portuguese sailors in 1950 to name it  Ilha Formosa , meaning  beautiful island .  After the Chinese Communists conquered mainland China in 1949, the Chinese Nationalist government moved to Taiwan.  Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist president, made Taipei the capital of the Republic of China.  The Nationalist government also controls several islands in the Formosa Strait.  These islands include the Matsu, Pescadores, and Quemoy groups.   Government.   The Chinese Nationalist government is based on a Constitution adopted in 1946 on the mainland.  Taiwan’s National Assembly has about 1,250 members.  Its main functions are to elect the president and to amend the Constitution.  The president is Taiwan’s most powerful government official.  The president appoints the prime minister and many other government officials.  The government has five branches – executive, judicial, legislative, control, and examination – each headed by a  yuan  (council).  The executive, judicial, and legislative yuan resemble the three branches of the United States government.  The control yuan watches over the activities of government officials and has the power of impeachment.  The examination yuan gives tests that are used to hire and promote government workers.  Although Taiwan is the seat of the Chinese Nationalist government, it is administered as a province of China.  The president appoints a provincial governor who serves an indefinite term.  The people elect the members of a provincial Assembly to four-year terms.  The provincial Assembly has duties that are similar to those of a state legislature in the United States.  The people also elect county and city government officials.   People.   Almost all the people of Taiwan live on the coastal plain that makes up the western third of the island.  Most Taiwanese are Chinese whose ancestors came to the island from Fukien and Kwangtung provinces on the mainland.  Over 1 ½ million more people fled to Taiwan from the mainland after the Communist take-over in 1949.  The population also includes people who probably are related to peoples in the Philippines.  Most of these Taiwanese live on reservations in the mountains.  About a third of the people of Taiwan farm the land.  Farms on the island average only 2 or 3 acres (0.8 to 1.2 hectares) in size, but Taiwanese farmers live well by Asian standards.  Power tillers are gradually replacing water buffaloes in the fields.  Many farmers can afford bicycles, motorcycles, refrigerators, radios, and television sets.  Most of the farmhouses are made of brick, with tile roofs and central courtyards of packed earth or cement.  A typical Taiwanese meal includes rice, served with vegetables and chopped meat or fish.  Most city people in Taiwan wear Western-style clothing.  Some workers go barefoot or wear wooden sandals.  Farmers and others who work in the hot sun wear cone-shaped straw hats.  The Taiwanese speak various Chinese dialects, depending on their regional birthplace.  But almost all the people also use Mandarin, the official Chinese dialect.  The majority of Taiwanese are Buddhists or Taoists.  About 90% of the population can read and write.  The law requires children to have six years of elementary school and three years of high school.  National Taiwan University in Taipei has the largest enrollment among Taiwan’s universities.   Land and Climate.   Taiwan, including the Pescadores islands, covers 13,900 square miles (36,000 square kilometers).  This area does not include the Matsu and Quemoy island groups, which are part of Fukien province on the mainland.  Thickly forested mountains run from north to south and cover about two-thirds of Taiwan.  The highest peak, Yü Shan (Mount Morrison), rises 13,113 feet (3,997 meters) above sea level.  At many places along the eastern coast, the mountains drop sharply to the sea.  Short, swift rivers have cut gorges through the mountains.  In the west, the mountains slope to gently rolling hills and level land.  The farmers have terraced many hills to provide more fields for growing rice.  Taiwan has a subtropical climate, with hot, humid summers and an average annual rainfall of more than 100 inches (250 centimeters).  Temperatures average about 80°F. (27° C) in summer and 65° F. (18° C) in winter.  Summer monsoons bring strong winds and rain to Taiwan.  In winter, monsoons bring rain and cooler weather to the north.  Typhoons occur almost every year, with damaging rains and strong winds.   Economy.   Taiwan has few natural resources except its mountain forests.  But the island's economy has expanded steadily with the growth of manufacturing and foreign trade.  Forest products include bamboo, camphor, lumber, paper, and plywood.  Taiwanese factories make cement, fertilizer, plastics, television sets, and other products.  Exports include bananas, canned foods, chemicals, electrical machinery, metals, plywood, sugar, and textiles.  Most exports go to Hong Kong, Japan, the United States, and West Germany.  Only about a fourth of Taiwan’s land can be farmed.  The farmers use much fertilizer and harvest two or three crops a year from the same field.  The chief crops include asparagus, bananas, citronella grass, mushrooms, pineapples, rice, sugar, sweet potatoes, and tea.  The farmers raise hogs and poultry.  Workers in the fishing industry catch such ocean fish as mackerel, sardines, and tuna.  Inland ponds produce carp, eels, and other fish.  Coal is Taiwan’s most important mineral, though the island has only small deposits.  Copper, gold, limestone, salt, and sulfur are also mined.  The government operates the natural gas and oil industries.  Chilung (Keelung), Suao, Hualien, Kaohsiung, and Taichung Harbor are international ports.  Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, near Taipei, is the country’s main air terminal.   History.   Aborigines were the first inhabitants of Taiwan.  Some Chinese came to the island from the mainland as early  as the 500’s, but large settlements did not begin until the 1600’s.  Dutch traders occupied a Taiwanese port from 1624 until 1661.  Koxinga, a Chinese Ming dynasty official, drove them out.  Manchu conquerors had overthrown the Ming dynasty in mainland China, and Koxinga hoped to restore the dynasty to power.  He wanted to use Taiwan as a base from which to attack the Manchus.  But the Manchus conquered Taiwan in 1683 and administered it as part of China.    In 1895, Japan gained control of Taiwan as a result of the first Chinese-Japanese War.  The Japanese developed Taiwan’s agriculture and industry and expanded its transportation networks.  China regained Taiwan after World War II ended in 1945.  In a peace treaty signed in 1951, Japan gave up all claims to Taiwan and the Pescadores islands.  In 1949, the Chinese Communists defeated Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist forces and took control of the mainland.  Chiang moved his government to Taiwan on December 8, 1949.  Both governments consider Taiwan a province of China.  Each claims to be the legal ruler of all China, and each has declared its determination to take over the other’s territory.  After the Korean War began in 1950, the United States said it would protect Taiwan against possible attacks from mainland China.  The U.S. and Chinese Nationalist governments signed a mutual defense treaty in 1954.  The Chinese Communists repeatedly shelled Matsu and Quemoy during the 1950’s.  The shelling of Quemoy in 1958 led U.S. air and naval forces to patrol the Formosa Strait.  Taiwan received about $1.5 billion in U.S. economic and technical aid up to 1965.  That year, Taiwan said its economy could stand on its own.  But it continued to receive U.S. military aid.  In the early 1970’s, Taiwan expressed concern over improved relations between the United States and Communist China.  In 1971, the United States announced it favored United Nations (UN) membership for Communist China.  But the United States also said that Nationalist China – a charter member of the UN – should retain its UN seat.  In October 1971, the UN expelled the Nationalists and admitted Communist China.  In 1972, President Richard M. Nixon visited Communist China and agreed to gradually withdraw U.S. military forces from Taiwan.  During the 1970’s, a number of nations ended their diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with Communist China.  The United States ended its diplomatic relations with Taiwan at the end of 1978, and established diplomatic relations with Communist China at the start of 1979.  In April 1979, the United States completed its military withdrawal from Taiwan.  The mutual defense treaty between the two countries was ended on December 31, 1979.  But the U.S. agreed to continue to supply Taiwan with some military aid.  Also, the two countries agreed to carry on unofficial relations through nongovernmental agencies.  President Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975.  Chiang’s son Chiang Ching-kuo had become prime minister in 1972.  He became the country’s most powerful leader after his father died.  He was elected president of Taiwan in 1978 and was reelected in 1984.  Source:   The World Book Encyclopedia , 1987 ed.  S.v. “Taiwan,” by Ralph N.

Mountains surround Taipei, which lies on the Hsintien, Keelung, and Tanshui rivers.  The city’s name is also spelled  Taipeh .  Industries in Taipei manufacture electrical equipment, plastics, plywood, steel, textiles, and other products.  Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taipei Domestic Airport, and Taiwan’s west coast railroad serve the city.  Taipei is the home of National Taiwan University.  The Chungshan, National Central, and National Palace museums near Taipei feature some of the world’s finest Chinese art.  The Chinese founded Taipei in 1708.  The city grew from three separate settlements.  The Wanhwa section, in the southwest, was the original city.  In the mid-1800’s, the Tataocheng district developed to the north.  About 1885, settlers built up Chengnei to the southeast.  The three districts merged in 1920.  The Chinese Nationalist government moved to Taipei in 1949 after the Chinese Communists conquered mainland China.  Since then, the city and its suburbs have expanded rapidly in all directions.

       Chinese Language  is one of the world’s oldest languages.  About 95% of the people of China speak Chinese.  Approximately 75% of the people of Singapore speak Chinese, and almost all of the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan speak it.  In addition, Chinese is the most common language of the Chinese communities of such cities as New York City and San Francisco, and Vancouver, Canada.  Chinese is written the same way throughout China.  However, the language consists of hundreds of dialects that vary from one area of the country to another.  These dialects differ so greatly that a person who lives in one area may not be able to converse with someone from another area.  The pronunciation of many words depends on the dialect being spoken.  Chinese belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family of languages.  This family includes Burmese, Thai, and Tibetan.   Written Chinese  has no alphabet.  Instead, it consists of about 50,000 characters.  A person who knows about 5,000 of the most frequently used characters can read a Chinese newspaper or modern novel.  Scholars who read ancient Chinese literature and documents must learn many more characters.  The earliest Chinese writing was made up of  pictographs .  These characters resembled the objects they represented.  Modern Chinese has two main groups of characters,  simple ideographs  and  compound ideographs .  Ideographs represent ideas rather than objects.  A simple ideograph consists of only one character.  Examples include the characters for  up  and  down .  A compound ideograph consists of two or more characters.  The character of “to bark” is a compound ideograph formed by the characters of mouth and dog.  The Chinese also developed a technique called  character borrowing .  It involves “borrowing” the character of one word to represent another word that has a similar pronunciation.  The meaning of a character that stands for more than one word may be difficult to determine.  To make the meaning of such a character clear, the Chinese developed  phonetic compounds .  A phonetic compound is a character that has an additional character or marking to help the reader determine the word it represents.   Spoken Chinese.   The common dialect of Chinese is  Northern Mandarin  or  Northern Chinese .  The Chinese call the dialect  p’u-t’ung hua , which means  standard language .  Northern Chinese is the official language of China and is taught in all the nation’s schools.  Those who speak it live throughout northern China and in several southwestern provinces. Other major dialects include  Cantonese ,  Hsiang ,  Kan-Hakka ,  Min , and  Wu .  They are spoken in many areas of China and in the Chinese communities of various cities in other countries.  Chinese dialects differ in the use of  tones .  A tone is the pitch used in saying a particular word.  Northern Chinese has four tones -  high level  (high and unwavering),  rising ,  low-dipping  (falling and rising), and  falling .  Some other dialects have as many as nine tones.  The use of tone is an important means of separating words of different meanings but similar pronunciations.  For example,  ma  means  mother  in a high-level tone,  horse  in a low-dipping tone,  scold  in a falling tone, and  hemp  in a rising tone.  Each of these words has a different character when written in Northern Chinese.  Chinese is spoken with no tenses,  For example, the sentence  Ta shi xuezhe  could mean “He is a scholar” or “He was a scholar,” depending on how it is used.  Many language experts consider Chinese to be  monosyllabic  - almost all the words have only one syllable.  Even words of more than one syllable can be broken down into single-syllable words.  For example,  xuezhe  (scholar) consists of two single-syllable words -  xue  (learn) and  zhe  (one who).   Development.   The earliest known examples of Chinese are inscriptions carved in bones and shells during the Shang dynasty (1700’s-1122? B.C.).  This early language had a simple structure.  It was the basis of a later language called  classical , or  literary Chinese .  The dialects of present-day Chinese developed from classical Chinese.  Northern Chinese began to be used during the A.D. 1300’s.  This dialect became China’s official language because it was spoken in Peking, the capital.  However, written Northern Chinese was not widely used until the Literary Revolution, a cultural movement that began in 1917.  Through the years, the government has promoted the use of Northern Chinese through the nation’s educational program.  In 1919, Chinese schools began to use a system of  phonetic signs  to teach standard pronunciation.  This method involved books that taught the pronunciation in Northern Chinese of Chinese characters.  In 1949, Chinese educators began to simplify characters to make them easier to learn and write.  In the mid-1950’s, the government introduced  Pinyin , a system of writing Chinese using the Roman alphabet.  This alphabet consists of the 26 letters used to write English and many other languages.  In 1978, the government directed that Chinese names and words used in English and other foreign language publications be written in Pinyin.  Pinyin replaced the  Wade-Giles system  and other writing systems that use the Roman alphabet.  Two British diplomats, Thomas Wade and Herbert Giles, developed this system during the late 1800’s and early 1900’s.  Reference:   The World Book Encyclopedia , 1987 ed.  S.v. “Chinese Language,” by David R. Knechtges.  -----  Spoken Chinese has many dialects, which differ enough in pronunciation to be considered separate languages.  Many non-Chinese callthe Northern Chinese dialect Mandarin, but the Chinese prefer the term  p’u-t’ung hua  (common language).  Other varieties of Chinese include Min, Wu, and Yueh (Cantonese), each of which has many local dialects.  Although each dialect of Chinese has its own pronunciation, all speakers of Chinese write the language in the same way.  The Chinese writing system uses  characters  instead of an alphabet.  Each character is a symbol that represents a complete word or syllable.  Scholars have developed several systems of writing the Chinese language in the Roman alphabet.  The Wade-Giles system was developed during the 1800’s by two English scholars, Sir Thomas Wade and Herbert A. Giles.   In 1979, China began using the Pinyin system in all news reports sent abroad and in all communications with other nations.  Many Chinese names are spelled somewhat differently in the two systems.  For example, the name of the man who led China’s Communist revolution is spelled Mao Zedong in the Pinyin system and Mao Tse-tung in the Wade-Giles system.

       Tones in Mandarin Chinese   Chinese is a tonal language.  In Mandarin Chinese, there are four tones, indicated respectively by the tone marks -, ´, ˇ and `.  First tone * - * high, level pitch * tī=kick Second tone * ´ * starting high and rising * tí=lift Third tone * ˇ * falling first, then rising * tĭ=body Fourth tone * ` * starting high and falling * tì=replace  The tone is marked above the vowel in the romanized syllable.  It is marked only in the  pinyin  romanization, not in the characters.  Some words have unstressed syllables.  These are toneless, and are not given tone marks.  For example, in  wŏmen  (=we, us), the syllable  men  is toneless and therefore has no tone mark on it.  This type of syllable is often called a neutral tone syllable.  -----   Vowels and approximate pronunciation   a = like a in car (but with no r-sound) e = like e in her (but with no r-sound) i = 1) like ee in bee     2) after c, s, z, ch, zh, r, like e in her (with no r-sound) o = like aw in saw u = like oo in spoon ü = similar to German ü or u in French "lune"; round your lips and try to say ee   Consonants   c = like ts in its, followed by a strong puff of breath ch = like ch in church, but with the tip of the tongue turned up and back to touch the roof of the mouth g = always as in give h = like ch in Scottish loch j = like j in jeer (strongly fronted:  pronounced as near to the front of the mouth as possible) q = similar to ch in cheap r = like English r, but with the tip of the tongue turned up and back to touch the roof of the mouth, so that it sounds something like the s in pleasure s = like s in sit sh = like sh in shoe, but with the tip of the tongue turned up and back to touch the roof of the mouth x = like sh in sheep (strongly fronted), but with lips widely spread y = like y in yard z = like ds in lids zh = like j in jug, but with the tip of the tongue turned up and back to touch the roof of the mouth  The three consonants p, t, and k should be pronounced with a strong puff of breath.  -----  Good morning/Good afternoon/Good evening. = Nĭ hăo.

For example, 11 is 10 plus 1, 19 is 10 plus 9; 20 to 90 are formed by multiplication.  For example, 30 is expressed as 3 times 10.  The numerals between the tens are expressed in multiples of ten plus the remainder.  For example, 33 is 3 times ten plus 3.  Alongside their traditional system of numerals, the Chinese are also familiar with Western figure notation, which facilitates communication where money, the telephone and room location, etc., are concerned.  0 = líng 1 = yī 2 = èr 3 = sān 4 = sì 5 = wŭ 6 = liù 7 = qī 8 = bā 9 = jiŭ 10 = shí 11 = shíyī 12 = shíèr 13 = shísān 14 = shísì 15 = shíwŭ 16 = shíliù 17 = shíqī 18 = shíbā 19 = shíjiŭ 20 = èrshí 21 = èrshí yī 22 = èrshí èr 23 = èrshí sān 24 = èrshí sì 25 = èrshí wŭ 26 = èrshí liù 27 = èrshí qī 28 = èrshí bā 29 = èrshí jiŭ 100 = yībăi 101 = yībăi língyī 102 = yībăi língèr 110 = yībăi yīshí 120 = yībăi èrshí 200 = èrbăi 1,000 = yìqiān 1,100 = yìqiān yībăi 2,000 = èrqiān 10,000 = yíwàn 50,000 = wŭwàn 100,000 = shíwàn 1,000,000 = yìbăiwàn 1,000,000,000 = shíyì  first = dìyī second = dìèr third = dìsān fourth = dìsì fifth = dìwŭ sixth = dìliù seventh = dìqī eight = dìbā ninth = dìjiŭ tenth = dìshí  Sources:    Oxford Starter Chinese Dictionary , (2000).

       Buddhism   Buddhism is one of the major religions of the world.  It was founded in India about 500 B.C. by a teacher called Buddha.  At various times, Buddhism has been a dominant religious, cultural, and social force in most of Asia, especially in India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Tibet.  In each area, Buddhism has combined with elements of other religions, such as Hinduism and Shinto.  Most of the Buddhists live in Sri Lanka, the mainland nations of Southeast Asia, and Japan.   The Beliefs of Buddhism   All Buddhists have faith in: 1)	Buddha;  2)	his teachings, called the  dharma ; and 3)	the religious community he founded, called the  sangha .  Buddhists call Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha the  Three Refuges  or  Three Jewels .   Buddha  was born about 563 B.C. in southern Nepal.  His real name was Siddhartha Gautama.  He was a member of a rich and powerful royal family.  At the age of about 29, Gautama became overwhelmed with the conviction that life was filled with suffering and unhappiness.  This conviction led him to abandon his wife and infant son and to seek religious enlightenment as a wandering monk.  After traveling throughout northeastern India for about six years, Gautama experienced enlightenment.  He believed he had discovered why life was filled with suffering and how people could escape from this unhappy existence.  After others learned of his discovery, they called him  Buddha , which means  Enlightened One .   The Dharma.   Buddha preached that existence was a continuing cycle of death and rebirth.  Each person’s position and well-being in life was determined by his or her behavior in previous lives.  For example, good deeds may lead to rebirth as a wise and wealthy person or as a being in heaven.  A person’s evil deeds may lead to rebirth as a poor and sickly person or even to rebirth in hell.  Buddha also taught that as long as individuals remain within the cycle of death and rebirth, they can never be completely free from pain and suffering.  Buddha said people could break out of the cycle by eliminating any attachment to worldly things.  By ridding themselves of such attachment, people would gain a kind of perfect peace and happiness.  Buddha called this state of peace and happiness  nirvana .  According to Buddha, those who are willing and able to follow the Middle Way and the Noble Eightfold Path will conquer their attachment to worldly things and thus achieve nirvana.     The Middle Way  is a way of life that avoids both the uncontrolled satisfaction of human desires and the extreme forms of self-denial and self-torture.   The Noble Eightfold Path  consists of: 1)	knowledge of the truth; 2)	the intention to resist evil; 3)	saying nothing to hurt others; 4)	respecting life, morality, and property; 5)	holding a job that does not injure others; 6)	striving to free one’s mind of evil; 7)	controlling one’s feelings and thoughts; and 8)	practicing proper forms of concentration.  After Buddha’s death, his followers collected the traditions that had developed around the dharma.  The oldest of the many Buddhist schools compiled a scripture called the  Tripitika .  This word means  Three Baskets .  The first part, the  Basket of Discipline , deals with the rules for regulating the order of Buddhist monks.  The second part, the  Basket of Discourses , consists largely of sermons.  The third part, the  Basket of the Higher Dharma , contains later and more systematic discussions of doctrine.  Later Buddhist schools have added their own scriptures.   The Sangha.   The word  sangha  sometimes refers to the ideal Buddhist community, which consists of those who have reached the higher stages of spiritual development.  The word also refers to the order of Buddhist monks and nuns.  In addition, the term means the community of monks, nuns, and laity.  The order of monks has always had a special role within the sangha.  It has played an important part in preserving and spreading Buddhism.  In many Buddhist groups, the discipline of monastic life is considered essential to those who seriously seek nirvana.  In most Buddhist countries, monks are expected to live a life of poverty, meditation, and study.  Monks are also expected to avoid sexual activity.  Some Buddhists become monks for life, but others serve in the sangha for only short periods of time.  The monks wear special robes and are a common sight in all Buddhist countries.  The laity also has an important role in the life of the sangha.  Members are expected to honor Buddha, to follow basic moral rules, and to support the monks.  They are also expected to pay special honor to images of Buddha and to objects that are associated with him.  Many of the laity have influenced the history of Buddhism.  During the 200’s B.C., Asoka, an Indian emperor, made Buddhism a kind of state religion.  He established a tradition that has led to close relations between religion and government in many Buddhist  countries.  In 1956, B.R. Ambedkar, an Indian layman, led a mass conversion that brought more than 1 million former Hindus in India into the sangha.   Buddhist Schools   Various Buddhist schools developed in India and in other Asian countries.  The most influential schools include the Theravada, the Mahayana, the Mantrayana, and Zen.  These schools have much in common, but they also differ in important ways.   The Theravada.   The word  theravada  means  Way of the Elders .  The Theravada school is the only one of the early Buddhist schools that has survived.  Today, it is the dominant religious tradition in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.  The Theravadans emphasize the importance of Buddha as a historical figure, the virtues of the monastic life, and the authority of the  Tripitika .  For them, the ideal Buddhist is a kind of saint called an  arhat .  Mahayanists and others have often referred to the Theravada and similar schools as  Hinayana , a term that means  lesser vehicle .  However, the Theravadans do not accept this name.   The Mahayana.   The word  mahayana  means  great vehicle . Most followers of the Mahayana live in Japan and in the other countries of East Asia.  The Mahayanists emphasize the existence of many Buddhas.  They often focus attention on Buddhas in heaven and on people who will become Buddhas in the future.  The Mahayanists believe that these present and future Buddhas are able to save people through grace and compassion.  Most Mahayanists accept the  Tripitika , but they believe that their own scriptures reveal a higher level of truth.  The Mahayanists teach various ways in which the laity, as well as monks, can achieve nirvana.  The Mahayanists encourage everyone to follow the ideal of the  bodhisattva .  A bodhisattva is a person who vows to become a Buddha by leading a life of virtue and wisdom.  At the highest level, a bodhisattva is one who postpones entering into nirvana in order to work to relieve suffering through acts of love and compassion.   The Mantrayana.   The word  mantrayana  means  sacred recitation vehicle .  Its major centers are in the Himalayan regions, in Mongolia, and in Japan.  The Japanese call it  Shingon .  Mantrayana Buddhism accepts most Mahayanan doctrines.  But it also emphasizes a close relationship between a spiritual leader called a  guru  and a small group of disciples.  The disciples spend much time reciting spells called  mantras , performing sacred dances and gestures, and meditating.  The school stresses sexual symbolism and believes that sex should be used for holy purposes.  The Mantrayana also believes in many terrifying devils, goblins, and other deities.  Attempts to visualize these deities, and the use of magic, play a large part in the school’s teachings and rituals.  The followers of Mantrayana Buddhism traditionally keep many of these beliefs and practices secret from outsiders.   Zen  is practiced chiefly in Japan.  It originated in China, where it is called  Ch’an .  Zen accepts most Mahayanan doctrines and emphasizes a close relationship between a master and his disciples.  However, Zen has developed distinctive practices that are designed to lead to a state of spiritual enlightenment called  satori .  Many followers of Zen believe that satori comes in a sudden flash of insight.  Others believe that satori must be achieved gradually through a long process of self-discipline, meditation, and instruction.  Source:   The World Book Encyclopedia , 1987 ed.

Money :   Basic Unit  - Singapore dollar.  -----    (image from  urlLink http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mapshells/south_east_asia/singapore/singapore.htm )   Singapore  is a small island country in Southeast Asia.  It lies near the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula about where the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean meet.  The sea is an arm of the Pacific Ocean.  Singapore consists of a large island and more than 50 smaller islands.  The large island, which is also called Singapore, covers 221 square miles (572 square kilometers).  The other islands have a combined area of about 17 square miles (44 square kilometers.  About half the smaller islands are uninhabited.  The majority of Singapore's people are Chinese.  Malays make up the largest minority group.  Almost all the people live in the capital, which also has the name of Singapore.  The capital lies on the southern coast of the main island and is a crowded, bustling center of trade, finance, and manufacturing.  The city's economic activity helps make Singapore one of the most prosperous countries in Asia.   Government.   Singapore is a republic.  A 79-member, one-house Parliament makes the country's laws.  A prime minister and a Cabinet carry out the operations of the government.  A president serves as head of state, but this official has little actual power.  The people elect the members of Parliament to five-year terms.  The head of the political party with the most seats in Parliament serves as prime minister.  The prime minister selects Cabinet members.  The People's Action Party (PAP), Singapore's largest political party, held all the seats in Parliament from 1968 until 1981.  Since then, it has held almost all the seats.  Singapore's judicial system consists of a Supreme Court and district, magistrate, and special courts.  The president, on the advice of the prime minister, appoints the chief justice and the six other judges of the Supreme Court.  Singapore has about 50,000 people in its army, navy, and air force.  Men must serve two to three years in the armed forces after reaching the age of 18.   People.   Singapore is one of the world's most densely populated countries.  More than 75% of the people are Chinese.  Malays make up about 15% of the population, and most of the rest of the people are Europeans or Indians.  Singapore has four official languages - Chinese, English, Malay, and Tamil.  Singapore's ethnic groups create a variety of cultures within the country.  Most urban Singaporeans wear modern Western-style clothing, but some Indians and Malays prefer traditional dress.  Restaurants offer an assortment of Chinese, Indian, and Malay dishes.  Singapore has no official religion.  Most of the Chinese in Singapore practice Buddhism or Taoism, and most Malays are Muslims.  Hinduism ranks as the main religion among the Indians, and Christianity among the Europeans.  Schools of higher education include the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological Institute.  Instruction is conducted in English in about two-thirds of the country's schools, and in Chinese in most of the others.  The government provides six years of free primary education to children who are citizens.  Art, music, and theater reflect the cultures of Singapore's various ethnic groups.  Cultural events include Chinese operas, Indian films, and Malay dancing.     The City of Singapore  lies on the southern coast of Singapore island.  More than 90% of the country's population live in the city.  Singapore is the busiest port in Southeast Asia.  Ships sailing to Australia, China, and Japan dock there to load and unload cargo.  Singapore is a  free port  - goods can be unloaded, stored, and reshipped without payment of import duties.  The city is built around its harbor.  Warehouses and concrete docks line the port.  In the crowded commercial section, modern skyscrapers tower over traditional Chinese shops.  Singapore has many handsome buildings that date from the 1800's, including the National Museum and the Raffles hotel.  The Jurong area is an industrial park west of the city that has factories.  The Botanical Gardens features large collections of tropical and subtropical plants.  The city's older residential sections lie near the docks.  These areas have many brick and stucco shops with living quarters on the second floor.  Some Malays live in bamboo houses thatched with palm leaves.  The wealthier sections of the city include modern single-family homes surrounded by flowers, shrubs, and trees.  Since the mid-1900's, the government has built many large complexes of apartment buildings in the capital and elsewhere on the main island.  These buildings are part of communities called  new towns .   Land and Climate.   Most of the islands of Singapore lie near the sea level.  The highest point, Timah Hill, is only 581 feet (177 meters) above sea level.  Rain forests cover most of the central part of the main island, and mangrove swamps lie along the northern coast.  A variety of wild animals, including tigers and leopards, once lived in Singapore.  However, most of them except monkeys, and snakes and some other reptiles, have become extinct because of urban development.  Singapore has a hot, moist climate.  The average annual temperature is about 80° F. (27° C).  However, sea breezes cool the country, and so temperature rarely rises above 94° F. (34° C).  The main island receives about 95 inches  (241 centimeters) of rain yearly.   Economy.   Singapore has a highly developed economy.  The import and export activities in the port area provide jobs for many people.  Singapore is also a major manufacturing center.  Its factories produce such goods as chemicals, electronic equipment, machnery, metals, paper, rubber, textiles, and transportation equipment.  Other major industries include food processing, petroleum refining, and ship-building and repairing.  In addition, Singapore is a major financial center.  It has many banks and insurance and finance companies, and a stock exchange.  There is little unemployment in Singapore.  The country's annual income  per capita  (per person) is one of the highest in Asia.  Singapore has few natural resources, and so it must import most of the raw materials needed for manufacturing.  Singapore refines crude petroleum from Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other oil-producing countries for export throughout Southeast Asia and the Far East.  One of Singapore's refineries ranks among the world's largest.  Only a small percentage of Singapore's people ork in agriculture.  The nation's farmers produce eggs, pork, poultry, orchids, and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.  The government of Singapore plays a major role in the country's economy.  For example, it decides what benefits, such as vacation time and sick leave, must be provided for workers by employers.  It also operates an employment agency to help people jobs, and it provides pensions for retired workers.  A 16-mile (26-kilometer) railway links Singapore to the Malay Peninsula.  Branch lines serve the city of Singapore and the industrial area of Jurong.  Changi International Airport lies at Changi Point on the northeastern part of Singapore island.  Singapore has daily newspapers and several radio stations.  A government-owned television network broadcasts in all four official languages.  Singapore belongs to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  ASEAN promotes economic, cultural, and political cooperation among its members.   History.   Since prehistoric times, people have lived on what is now Singapore island.  The name  Singapore , which means  Lion City  in the Sanskrit language, has been used for the island since the A.D. 1100's.  The name was probably given because of the many tigers, mistakenly called lions, that inhabited the island.  From the 1100's to the 1800's, Singapore was a base for pirates and fishing fleets.  During the 1200's and 1300's, Singapore harbor, then called Tumasik, served as a trading center.  Invaders from the island of Java (now part of Indonesia) destroyed Tumasik in 1377.  Until the early 1800's, most of Singapore was covered by jungles and swamps.  A small fishing village lay on the southern coast of the main island.  Sir Stamford Raffles, an agent for a British trading organization called the East India Company, realized the potential importance of the island's location to British trade.  In 1819, he gained possession of Singapore harbor for Great Britain through an agreement with a sultan of Johor (now part of Malaysia).  All of Singapore came under British control in 1824.  In 1826, it became part of the Straits Settlement, a British colony.  The port prospered, and Singapore's population grew rapidly.  Large numbers of Chinese settled in Singapore, and many of them became merchants.  In the 1920's and 1930's, the British built air bases and a naval base on Singapore island.  In 1942, during World War II, Japanese troops captured the island.  They occupied it until 1945, when it was recovered by the British.  Britain dissolved the Straits Settlement in 1946 and made Singapore a separate crown colony.  The people of Singapore elected their first representative legislature in 1955.  Singapore gained internal self-government in 1959, but Britain remained responsible for its defense and foreign affairs.  In 1963, Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia, which also included Malaya and the Borneo territories of Sabah (formerly North Borneo) and Sarawak.  However, economic and political disputes soon developed between Singapore and the rest of Malaysia.  In 1965, Singapore withdrew from the federation and became an independent nation.  Since independence, Singapore's economy and population have grown steadily, and the People's Action Party has controlled the government.  Lee Kuan Yew, the party's leader, has held the position of prime minister during that entire period.  His government plays a major role in the continuing growth of the nation's economy.
