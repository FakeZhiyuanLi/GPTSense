      So the day starts out normal. I wake up at 6:30. Standard. I make pancakes for cuz. Not Standard. The i get free time from cuzes. So i call my friend. And she says" Hey Chaz" My response is standard and i get the standard answer: not much. So i ask her if she can do something; her anser: no i am busy all day. Wat pisses me off is when i know for a fact that she isn't busy so i am spending another boring day alone. Then i have to go get clothes: again boring. Then i get free time from rents. Finally. I am thinking i will go skateboard to Starbucks and get something to drink. Starbucks is good for me. Well thats me signing off.  The time is right You both lean close You touch and kiss It is heavenly You can't describe it But you and your lover Both feel the same Delirious with passion Burning with fiery emotion Emotion full of love This passion is fueled By The First Kiss  Rebel For Life

       Okay...so i get back from the orentation thing. It was totaly boring. I am taking ceramics wich will be awsome. And Black and White Photography. And General Art and Tone Chimes as electives. My Cuzes is here and i have a freakin headache. they won't shutup. Its " Chaz look at this" Chaz look at that." Just shut up. Well i am not going to be able to see my friend because the frickin phones are busy. God save me.   It is so dark down here So cold with no one here. All alone yet someone is here. Physically: no. Spiritually and mentally: yes He seems familiar yet so distant. I call out and he responds With a deep yet quiet voice: Someone does care Chase. Someone cares. When life gets you down deep Look to your friends, not pity. I realized He was with Me

       I just back from montana...and u know the way that works. Constant flying and switching planes...man i feel as though i have gone through twenty washers and dryers. We were stuck on the tarmac( the runway) in Phoenix for like 2 hours because of a d*** thunderstorm...I hate the weather. I was perfect weather for the vacation week but then on the travel day it is the worst weather of all. I start school soon so i am kinda bummed...I am also bummed that no one is on but thats life....Talk later maybe get some sleep.   Love: you can't live without it Yet it is so hard to get When every girl you meet is Charming, beautiful, smart, and funny, Yet is taken or denies you? What is it they want? They always overlook the good. I may not be handsome, but, I am smart, funny, and caring. I dream of the day when, A smart, beautiful girl comes along, And won't overlook my good qualities. All I Want is to be Loved  just a heads up u get a free poem be ME with each post so live with it
