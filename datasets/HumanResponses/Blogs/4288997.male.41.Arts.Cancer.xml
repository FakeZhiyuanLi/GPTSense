       urlLink    A friend asked me to take a few shots of her cat. It's interesting to see the reaction when people see this image. This image has won best of show, member's choice and a second place finish in three different competitions.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This shot was also taken during "Doors Open", Toronto. This lady walked to the railing on the second floor and I snapped a few shots of her. Her wardrobe and posing really worked in the shots.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is a classic example of being in the right spot at the right time. Took this about 10 years ago in Port Delhousie. One of the few times the sun set on the horizon without any clouds. I watched and waited hoping the boat would get in front of the sun before it set completely. This shot was taken with a 500mm mirror lens with a 2X converter attached.&nbsp; urlLink
