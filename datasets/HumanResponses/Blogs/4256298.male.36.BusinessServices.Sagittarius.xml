						   DREAMWEAVER Lying alone in your bed Images from the past filling your head You try to run, you try to hide But there is no escape, your eyes are open wide Long time ago you felt alive Now only emptiness is blackening your life The time has come to break away Or you go astray Dreamweaver - there is so much more to see Dreamweaver - There is a deeper way to feel Dreamweaver - misery takes a hold of you paralyzes your soul Dreamweaver - find a way to understand Dreamweaver - You hold your fate in your own hand Dreamweaver - break your chains and make your move Or you might just see a dreamweaver's fall Things that you started Are still undone While you are wasting you precious life The sleepless nights Won't leave you be You're going astray

						   I cant believe the bad streak of luck I am having recently.....Am I cursed or is someone trying to tell me something?  First I get a scare of possible heart problems on Tuesday night....Friday morning my car is tampered with and the alarm wont let me start it....$120 later I get my car back and running. Last night Tiny was tweaking most of the night walking around the apartment crying for no reason....(he goes to the vet today:P..that will teach him). So I figure Monday starts a new day and a new week and things can only get better...WRONG!!!  I go to the kitchen early this morning and fix a bowl of cereal oblivious to all that is going on(invasion). I am alerted to somethign amiss to Tiny's hunting squeaks. I ask myself WTF is he hunting....well I get up and go see and was shocked at the invasion force mother nature had decided she needed. I had a 3/4 full bag of cat food on the top of the fridge....well it was fully involved with ants by now.....20 minutes later after heavy chemical warfare I won the battle but suffered financial and resource losses. 1 $32 bag of catfood was the casualty. But by god I eradicated them little bastards with extreme predjudice!  I feel that I am a good person and do good things for people. Why am I getting a bad dose of Karma? Ontop of this all work is killing me financially the new comp plan is absolutely screwed in the fac tI am making way less money at this point in time.  Oh well....things can only get better no?

						   Well another update today.....last night I spent the night in the emergency room with extreme chest pains and a hurting arm.....heart attack? No they found nothing to be physically wrong with me....good or bad? I say bad...my chest still hurts but its not the chest itself persay. Heartache? Good possibility but who am I to say? Duaan spent the whole time with me and for that I am grateful.. She came thru for me again in a pinch and this is time #2. XXOOOXX  Onto the subject at hand ....my depression...will it ever end? Should I seek counsel or meds? Duaan even mentioned her observation of me being depressed....and I agreed. I feel in a tight spiral downward into an abyss and that spiral is out of control. I feel myself closing in on myself every day more and more. I scream for the inner turmoil to cease but those screams fall upon un hearing ears. I fight and I fight and now I am stressed. With the death of Stimp pushing me over the precipice and at work the lack of income coming in are both main contributors to my condition. I now have to go take a stress test with my regular doctor as a follow up....me stressed? BAH I thought I was a rock when it came to stress but I guess it piles up and then takes you out of the game till you get better. I plan and hope to pull out of my spiral soon and rejoin the world.   All for now...thanks for reading

						   Well here I go folks. I have chosen this as an outlet for my mental pain that has haunted me for 3 weeks now. 3 weeks ago I found my cat Stimpy to be sick and shortly after that he ended up taking the big sleep and goign to kitty heaven. He was in great pain with the number 2 feline killer known. Chronic Kidney disease. There was nothing short of 5-10k in hard cash to save my beloved cat. With not having the cash available I had to do the unthinkable and put him to sleep. You would think that this would be the sane and correct decision. Well people tell me it is but why do I feel that a part of my soul I have lost? I feel different after commiting this horrible deed. I feel I have lost a part of my soul and humanity.  I suffer from constant guilt on having to make this decision. Was it the right thing to do? Did anyone ask Stimpy if he wanted this? The horrible haunting memories of him purring in my arms and being all loving to me while we were doing the horrible act still haunts me all the time. The loving look he gave me as the first injection entered him. Those innocent yellow eyes looking at me have been burnt into my memory and I am constantly haunted by this. My soul still hurts weeks later and I see no end in sight for a healing factor....the people around me have no clue as to the inner pain I feel and they think I am just being a jerk to them. In reality I am pushing them away for my own protection. I cannot afford anymore pain in my heart or soul at this time. Another episode as such will drive me to teh edge with no rescue. Everyday is a struggle to not breakdown. But we trudge on.  As above I feel a large part of me has gone now that Stimpy is no longer with me. Some heartless bastards will say..he was just an animal but I rebutte that in saying nay. He was my son. my companion, 1/2 of my sanity, and above my friend.  He was always there when I was down and out and when I needed a pickme up he always seemed to come up to me and say "Dad....look at me I am cute and loveable forget your worries its ok ....NOW GET ME SUM TREATS!!"  Well I think that sums up things for now....
