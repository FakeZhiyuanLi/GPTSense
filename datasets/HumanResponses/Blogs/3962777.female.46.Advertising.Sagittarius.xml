       I keep thinking about what my boss' husband says about being a parent...."Life without Parole." Interesting....since my youngest is now a proud member and resident of the county jail.   Not sure what I'm supposed to do at this point.  Bailing him out doesn't work. Talking doesn't work. Yelling doesn't work.  Guess it's going to have to be tough love....hopefully he doesn't take that as his mom doesn't give a crap about him.  Wish I was with my grandson making purple snowman with playdoh....or watching a movie with him lying on my lap.  I miss him terribly.  I wonder sometimes if he really knows who I am and how much I love him.  Ok, enough for the first time....I guess I'll get better at this....but at least I have made the first blog....blog...what the hell does that mean anyways?  Chow

      I am so grateful Hurricane Charley went West - not grateful for the devastation it left behind in Punta Gorda.   I moved to South Florida in Feb-00. We have yet to have a busy hurricane season, and have not had any close calls, that is until Charley.  For close to 6 hours we didn't know if he was going to go West, NWest or East.  He was a little erratic for a while....almost like a drunk you watch trying to find their way to the bathroom in a crowded bar.  I know I will encounter a hurricane sooner or later.  It's the nature of the beast down here in Miami.  I'm just hoping it's much later than sooner.  Chow

      Well, I finally did it. I managed to sit down and write a 2 page letter to my son. I will mail it tomorrow, along with a picture.  I believe that was the hardest letter I have ever had to write.  How does one write a letter to their son in jail?  "Hey there, how's it going....how's the weather there?"  No...it just doesn't work that way.   I didn't want to complain, criticize or reprimand him. That's not going to do him any good, not at this point. You can't say I told you so, because I'm sure by now he's figured that out.   No, I just made sure that he knows I love him, miss him and will see him as soon as I get there in September. That's all I could do. Maybe the next letter will be easier - I hope so.  Chow

      How does one get started daily "blogging"?    I have all the intention of coming home after work, grabbing a nice hot cup of Java and sitting down to Blog. Instead, I look at the empty screen - with the blinking cursor and my mind goes blank.  Maybe I should start using this to vent my frustrations and anger that I bring home from work....that might work. Maybe I'll try that on Monday.  This weekend I'm house sitting for a friend.  Those of us that live in apartments, love having friends with homes and the money to travel.  We get to "pretend" we exist in something other than a multi-unit dwelling (which tags us as "dwellers").  But, after a full weekend of taking care of two dogs, one Quaker, one aquarium and a pond full of fish out front....I'm ready to go back to dwelling in the multi-unit - all I have to do is dust, vacuum and clean the toilets and run the dishwasher once a week.  I've even gotten to the point where most of my work clothes go to the dry cleaners twice a month.  It's cheap down here....1.49 for each item.  Beats doing laundry and ironing on the weekend.  The weather here is South FLA sucks this weekend, some tropical depression heading North towards the Carolina's.  Great for us - sucks for them.  I'm slowly getting used to the weather alerts here (after 4.5 years). The first year here, every time there was a weather alert, I was the first one at Publix at 7:00 am buying batteries, water, tuna fish...etc.  Not any more.  If it's gonna hit, I take all my electronics to storage, which is hurricane proof...jump on a plane and got North. End of story.    So, now I will have a bagel, a cup of coffee....throw a movie in the DVD player, curl up on the couch with a blankie and veg out. I guarantee I'll see no more than the first 20 minutes of whatever movie I put in.  Chow!
