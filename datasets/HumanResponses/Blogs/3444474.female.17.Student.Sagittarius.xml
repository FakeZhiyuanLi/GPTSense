      So, I was listening to  Muse , and I really like this song, their single, whatever, "Time Is Running Out". So since I like it so much, I am going to post the lyrics :)  I think I'm drowning asphyxiated I wanna break this spell that you've created  you're something beautiful a contradiction I wanna play the game I want the friction  you will be the death of me you will be the death of me  bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  our time is running out our time is running out you can't push it underground you can't stop it screaming out  I wanted freedom bound and restricted I tried to give you up but I'm addicted  now that you know I'm trapped sense of elation you'd never dream of breaking this fixation  you will squeeze the life out of me  bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  our time is running out our time is running out you can't push it underground you can't stop it screaming out how did it come to this? ooooohh  you will suck the life out of me  bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  our time is running out our time is running out you can't push it underground you can't stop it screaming out How did it come to this? ooooohh  Keke, I'm done now.   In other news, I'm a little worried about Greg...I need to talk to him.   *sigh*  More later when I'm not about to hop in the shower :)

      So I'm listening to really sugary heartache pop music right now.  I'm intrigued by this girl singing it though...JoJo...she's beautiful, and her voice is so amazing...I don't know why I like her so much, lol. I'm not usually into this kind of music but I can't help listening to it over and over again. It's the same thing with that Maria Mena song, "You're The Only One". I can't stop listening to it, once I start, I don't wanna turn it off, I just want to sing to it over and over.  God...what the fuck is wrong with me?  I can't sleep, Lord knows why. My sleep schedule is totally fucked officially. I wish it wasn't. I start work on monday, I'd kinda like to not be tired when I go in.   //sings, "Get out, right now, it's the end of you and me..."  GOD MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!  I don't even feel that way about anyone, so what the fuck?!  Oh well...whatever.   At any rate, I am bored at 3:30AM...someone hit me with something...hard.

      So I decided today that I am getting a Mac laptop instead of a PC. It's cheaper to get a Mac than the Dell I could've gotten through the school. Plus, the Mac OS has gotten ten times better than it was when we owned Mac's years ago, it's more stable, and in general, just plain looks better. You also can't get as many viruses on a Mac as you can on a PC.   In conclusion, I am paying less for the Mac and getting more for what I am paying for, so nieh.   More later when I'm not watching TV at the same time. :)

      So now I'm just posting because I'm bored.   I had a really wierd dream last night.   From what I remember...I was talking to this really hot girl in a bed, not my bed or a bed I knew at all necessarily, but it was a bed, a small one, so we were close together. And we were talking, and getting close, and then we were making out and it was getting really heavy. And then...one of her friends noticed us, and she jumped out of the bed and she started yelling at me, and yelling at her friend, that nothing was going on and she was just sleeping and had no idea what was going on.   I don't know what it means...but it was wierd. Really, really wierd.   Hot.   But really wierd. :P  The girl looked a lot like Jess, but not entirely.  ------------------------------------- In other news, I am rocking out to Coheed and Cambria. Go me :rockon:  In completely unrelated news, I painted my nails red today, they are quite pretty :)  And finally,   I am in love with a girl named Fred :D  //musical reference

      So, I was doing research on colleges that have the best theatre programs, and you've got Yale, and Harvard (number 20, hahah that's funny), and then you've got the smaller schools like Whitman College in Washington state, and Catawba, where my friend goes.   I want something farther away when I do my acting stuff. I don't necessarily want to be near the city, because NYC is known for its musicals...and I'm not a musical actress. Never have been.   I dunno...this is so hard. But I'm going to do it. I need to do it. I can't see myself doing anything else but acting. It's what I want, and it's what I love.   You don't find art, art finds you...it's so fucking true.   It sucks, lol, because it's a hard life...  But it's true, and I can't deny it anymore.   Blah. Now to memorize LOT'S of monologues.

      //rocks out to my favorite  Injected  song. :rockon:  So anyhow, another uneventful day to add to my belt.   I talked to Cameron when I woke up, that was good. He went back to work a little bit afterward. I miss him. *sigh* Well, I think I'm seeing him tomorrow, I might not be, I don't know quite yet. I don't remember if we're doing something or not. I think we were going to see Farenheit 9/11...or was that Saturday...did we even decide on going or not!?  Bah. I'll figure it out. That's why his new cellphone is a beautiful thing :D  I was thinking about dropping by the Foote School at some point soon. I miss them. I wonder how many newbies are there this year.   I miss doing theatre in the summers...I miss doing theatre period. I feel like something is missing and I think that's it.   I want to be on stage...and now more than ever, I think that is what I'm meant to do. It's worth a stab in the dark. I'm not meant to sit at a desk my whole life, I couldn't do that...good Lord, my ADHD would totally not let me do that! I want the stage, I want the lights on my face and the makeup and the costumes, the memorizing and the blocking. I want the suspense and the drama and how at home I feel when I'm doing it.   I didn't think I'd miss it so much.   Damn.   I think I'm going to have to transfer somewhere where I can study theatre...shit...that sucks.   I had better do well first semester then, because I can't do this. I'm not meant to push paper my whole life, or work in an office. I love to learn but...I'd rather learn about theatre and acting than math and science.   *sigh* sooooo muuuuuuuch to think about. Blah.   We'll see where this goes. *shrugs*

      So, yeah. Today marks another day in which I was called a whore.   Meh.   Nothing new.   The funny thing was, it came from Chris Hanel's MOTHER. Not Chris Hanel, no no...Chris Hanel's MOM.   All I have to say is...duba-u tee eff.   I mean really...the woman doesn't even know me, fuck, she hasn't even met me, and she decided to call me a ho.   Niiiice. I can see my reputation at '2k is a beautiful one. *shakes head*  I found it humorous, I mean...not initially...when I first read her statements about me, I wanted to cry, because I mean...what the fuck, she's judging me on a few things I said in the past.   I've changed, and we all know this.   I'm in a relationship where neither I nor the other plans on having sex before we are married.   I have decided, on my own accord, that I would save myself for when I got married.   My reputation preceeds me, apparently.   Meh.   If she chooses to think those things of me, so be it. I can't make the Hanel's believe one thing or another.   Atleast Chris doesn't view me like that. That's always a plus.   In a way, I'm glad she said that to me. I made myself proud, 'cuz I didn't fly off the handle.   I didn't even call her a bitch, go me!  Greg on the other hand...he was PISSED, lol. I mean I was upset, but he was P I S S E D. I would never talk to an adult like that, let's just put it that way, lol.  Anyhow, that's the end of my talking about crazy parents.   Expect a random, philosophical post later, I like those :)

      I have officially stolen Greg's idea and am using song lyrics in my subject titles. Go me, and go Greg for being so damn creative :P  On a completely unrelated topic, I have wasted away another day. I'm good like that.   Ooooh, Sic Transit Gloria just came on...yay Winamp, and yay Brand New. :D  I don't know why I like such depressing music sometimes.   I mean, this whole song is about this guy's sexual experience with a girl that will never love him...there's other stuff in there too, but mainly...it sounds like it goes badly.   "He whispers that he loves her but she's probably only in it for the s-..."   I mean c'mon, lol.   I think that I like the music because...it sounds a lot like my love life, from my perspective, and the perspective of those I dated in the past.   Messed up, isn't it?  I've only had a few relationships that weren't totally fucked in some way.   Make that like...one, lol.   In another completely unrelated topic, I really wish I could get out more.   I mean...go out with my friends. Unfortunately, most of my friends are boys. This in mind, my mother thinks I'm going to go out and fuck all of them, because I would do such a thing, right?  And in the past, yes, I would've, because I was completely immoral back then, and really didn't give a shit about me, or my body, or what anyone really thought about it. But I'm different now. And I suppose she doesn't totally trust me, and that's okay. Eventually she will. One day.   When I'm married with my three kids and my dog in suburbia, lol.   And even then...maybe she won't.   She and I have been good lately though. Which is nice. No arguing, no screaming matches, no calling me a whore or me calling her a bitch.   It's been peaceful.   I like this.   And I think that me moving out in August will be good for us.   I'll grow up, and she'll let go.   It will be a marvelous thing. :)  I hate missing people, but there are only a few people that I will really miss...they know who they are.   More later, when I feel like posting something meaningful.

      I fucking hate long distances.   I also fucking hate stupid asses who blame everyone and their mom's for their shit, and don't take the blame for themselves.   I also ALSO fucking hate re-re's that won't take hints. *dave, that is not you*  In conclusion, I am taking lot's of people off my buddy list, and in doing that reducing the number of stupid cunts that IM me.   In other news...  It is almost two AM, and I'm still up. I think this is because my sleep schedule is totally fucked up *I really wish it wasn't*. I also need to shower, but have negated to do so up until now. I may do it now...hmmm...it would be a good idea. I like being clean before bed.   *sighs* I miss some of my friends. I've seen Cameron a lot and Andrew, but that's really about it. I haven't really seen anyone else. I should. There's only so much time before we all head off in separate directions. It would be a good idea.   Hmmm...I need to start working and stop being a lethargic piece of shit. It would serve me better to have something to do during the day.   It's only three days a week anyhow *shrugs* I can do that.   I should get to bed.   But my e-life is so much more exciting...

      I'm bored. I haven't started work yet, and I assume that once I do, I will be posting there about how tedious it is. *shrugs*  I didn't do much today. I am sick of not having anything to do during the day. It is a surprise to me that I haven't gotten fat yet from just sitting around all day not doing anything. I've actually dropped to exactly 130.5 lbs...should I be worried? Nah, I'm not a stick yet.   More later, I suppose.  --Nina

      Went to a party tonight, that was cool. It was just a graduation party for a friend of the family, she graduated from NYU about a month or so ago. Was kinda dull but meh, what can you do? It's not like any of my friends were there but there were some kids there that were like 15+ years of age, so I dealt with it.   July 4th family thing tomorrow, don't know whether to like the idea of it or hate it yet. Depends on who shows up from the fam. I hope my tio Papo comes, he's teh fucking cool, and really funny but my mom said he might not. My aunt Miriam (she's not really my aunt by blood, but by the fact that she's my cousin's mother) is coming with her baby *so cute* so that's a savior, and Cameron is coming over at around 8 to save me after dinner, lol.   In other news, I got a graduation card today from a friend of the family, it had $50 in it, I was stoked, lol. I wanna save up the rest of my grad money I get (and I'll get some tomorrow, I know it, lol) and get a digital camera, and now I'm on my way to doing that. I might take a little out of my paycheck next week too and do that.   :D  Oh joyous, bed soon, yay. Driving around in the morning running errands with my mom, weee.   Later :)

      ^^ that lyric=creepy as hell...Clay honey, what were you thinking? o_0  Had really wierd dreams last night and later today when I napped. The one during my nap had Greg in it, and my dream last night had Cameron and Gregory...I need to not think so much at night.   Second day after work, I'm exhausted, and I really didn't even DO anything, but I came home and I was just so tired. I had to take a nap, that never happens to me.   Wierd.  Fireworks on friday :) I always love watching them...I can get mesmorized really quickly. My favorites are the ones that scream after they burst...I love those. I'm such a kid when it comes to fireworks. I still remember seeing them last year with Ed when I stayed with him in New Canaan. That was sweet, one of the really romantic things we ever did together. Mmm, that was nice.   Anyhow,   Meh, I am done for now, I'll write more later if I feel so inclined.

      So I had my first day of work, and I didn't really do all that much. Made phone calls all day, waited for people to call me back, whatever. It was pretty...meh, dull to be frank.   Oh well, tomorrow I get make even MORE phone calls...LOT'S of phone calls...yay.  $10 an hour to make phone calls, and I work about 7.5 hours a day.   I'd say I'm making out like a bandit, personally.   More later, I'm going out soon. :)

      I am getting used to this whole four hours of sleep deal. I think I've got a sleep schedule back, albeit a shitty one, but it works, and I can get through the days without being totally dead by 4. So whatever.  I am very cold right now. This building is ALWAYS like a meat freezer, it's ridiculous. I swear, I could cut glass right now, and it's JULY. Can't they just turn it down a little, maybe?  I had to make a purchase order, so they gave me the company credit card...I feel very important right now, lol. I could totally use this credit card for my own personal gain...but I'm not a bitch like that.  In other news, Cameron leaves tomorrow, and this saddens me greatly. He'll be gone for nine days. *sigh* I don't  even know if I'll see him today. We will see.   I'm at work, so I'm done for now.

      I need to stop posting, but I feel like bitching at the whole world.   I don't know why, I was fine most of the day.    This song is making me feel like seeing Cameron. I'd feel better if I did. The really cheesy thing is that I think of him everytime I hear this song. Once I heard the song, it just kind of clicked in my head that this was the song that made me think of him. It's a comforting feeling, hearing the song and then thinking of him. It reminds me that of all things in this world, there's still one thing I can always rely on; him. It's a nice thought, true or not.   It's the one relationship in my life that hasn't been fucked for one reason or another. For this I am glad. He keeps me sane and grounded, but he doesn't give me harsh reality. He gives me warmth and peace and love.   it's quite comforting.

      I'm swimming in this desire,   my head is falling off my shoulders losing all sense of my sanity  and fuck reality  you were so much better  I'll never have you back, will I...  ...  ------------------  I keep putting that everywhere.   I like it.  Well no, I don't LIKE it, but it just...it hits me somewhere in my mind, or my heart, or both, whichever. All I know is I read it, and I feel so...empty. For no reason.   I have also been listening to really sappy music. All these love songs that I hadn't touched in years. Like right now, I'm listening to Lifehouse...Lifehouse?!  Me?!  What. The. Fuck. :P  "I've got somebody elses thoughts in my head, I want some of my own..."  So fucking true.   Jason, I totally feel you (Jason is the lead singer of Lifehouse, if you all didn't know)  I just want to bleed and get it over with.

      I'm at work, so I guess I'll keep it short.   I am having a rather good day :)  My new laptop is going to kick so much ass it's not even funny. I'm even getting an iSight webcam with it. 'tis a beautiful thing. And it's still under $1,500, that is so exciting.   I haven't done much else today, it's just been a nice day. It rained, which was nice. My mom got me a bouquet of beautiful sunset roses...for no reason at all, lol. They're so pretty. I felt special, teehee.  In other news, I'm totally insane emotionally this week due to the fact that I was born of the female persuasion, therefore if my emotions seem odd, don't worry, it will all pass soon enough.   I feel so lovesick :) 'tis a beautiful feeling, especially when totally random.   I just love my life today.   *grins happily*

       You are very correct, I'm on the Right and I'll be damned if I change sides. I refuse to join a side that would rather protect the lives of animals before children. I'll be damned if I join a side that wants to take away everything my family has worked for and give it to some fucking useless sack of shit over in the projects because it's not fair that he doesn't have our business. I'll be damned if I'm going to support people who want our country to roll over and take everything the world gives us right up the ass like France.  Fuck that. I have to much pride in myself, my family, my country to support socialist fucktards who want to ruin everything this country stands for. Fuck that. If you have a problem with the fact that I'm a conservative, fuck you too. I'm allowed to have my opinions, and support who I want to support because of the constitution. I'll be damned if I'll let the Democrats take that away from me.    Isn't that lovely?   I fucking hate people like that.   Now I remember why I don't really talk to her much.   *shakes head* I won't even go into all the counter arguments I have on that, but she's right, she can believe what she wants. But fuck if I'm going to listen to it told me like THAT!!!  //death rattle in the distance  ...

      //rocks out even though I'm dead tired.  That's it, I'm totally not staying up that late anymore!!!  I can't, being that exhausted at work is just not working for me. I need to sleeeeeeeeeeep.   I'm going to bed at 12 tonight if it's the last thing I do, lol. -------------------- I watched John Kerry and his new B.O.B. John Edwards this morning.   I've never seen two people faking to like each other so vehemently in my life, lol.   Okay no, that's not true. I think they respect each other a lot...but they were just laying it on WAY too thick for me to believe it.   And John Kerry tries to be funny, but he's not.  John Edwards personally has more charisma than John Kerry and certainly  more than President Bush. If Kerry comes close, it will be because of his choice of running mate. A good choice, I think.   And his accent is r0x0rs. ;)  //loves accents --------------------- Anyhow, so yeah;  My boss suckered me into working four days this week. She really needs to stop doing that, lol. I wanted friday off, but oh well.  In other news:  I am going to nap now.   Many

       Over and over in my brain again...   I hate it when Cameron gets tactile defensive. It makes me so mad. All I did was tickle his arm a little, and he pulls away from me and just sits by himself on the other side of the couch. So I pulled away from him too and sat on the other side in a ball of Nina, watching  The Matrix: Reloaded , and being annoyed.   He gets like that, and I can't touch him, and he just walks away from me and won't talk to me. It pisses me off, I hate it.   Grrrr  //fumes  In other news, I'm dead fucking tired. I need to sleep tonight, I can't get three hours again, I'll die. Ugh.   Bed time soon...  //wants to sleep so bad but can't.

      I saw Farenhiet 9/11 tonight. I won't even comment on it...but it got me going, lol. I don't think I've ever felt more disgusted in my life though. Not with the movie, but just everything going on around me in the world. I know it's totally overexaggerated and somewhat inaccurate, but I mean really, the basic premise is:    THE WORLD IS TOTALLY FUCKED.    In other news, I am teh tired, I think I will go to bed before two AM tonight, go me lol.  I'm really glad I joined a Social Justice/Social Change learning community. I fucking hate the state of the nation right now, I fucking hate the state of most things right now, personal or otherwise, but we won't go there in this post. :)  Anyways, I'm gonna make my way to my bed eventually.   Night all, maybe.

      Wee, John Mayer makes me oh so happy. Too bad he's playing in CT after I leave.   Hmmm..but Guster plays next week and THAT is good (needs tickets, needs tickets!!) :)  I missed Jason Mraz though, and that makes me sad.   Anyhoo, so yeah, July the 4th was good. There wasn't as much family as I had previously thought, which made for an easier time and also made it more enjoyable. no tio Papo though, that was saddening. My cousin Luli was there though, and she's always cool. :)  Then Cameron came over later. That was fun. We made smores...so gooey teehee they were yummy. And we played with sparklers, and he burned his finger, which was funny 'cuz it's totally something he would do. He also broke the downstairs screen door. He walked into it, and it came off the tracking.   We needed a new one anyhow. God knows how many times I've broken the damn thing, lol.  So anyhow, that was my day. I might go out with Cam and Andrew later, maybe not, depends on if Andrew has anything to do, in which case if he doesn't, we're out, if he does, I'm totally going to see Spiderman dos without him, lol.   Anyhow, that's all for now. :D

      According to Gregory and the urban dictionary, the word "wub" can mean many things.  One definition being: To sodomize with a knife.  example:  I want to  wub  you.  o_0 0_o  How totally fucked up is that?  It's really funny...but really fucked up too.

I wished he could've stayed longer, but I had no idea when my mom was going to be home and he had to leave soon but...it was good, I'm glad I got to spend time with him. &nbsp; We drove out to Cheshire to Sweet Claude's 'cuz he wanted a milkshake. I didn't get anything, and paid. I figured it was okay, 'cuz he was spending the gas money to get his ass out here an hour.  &nbsp; *sigh* Now I'm alone again. I think I'm getting a pedicure, and I'm definetly cashing my paycheck.  &nbsp; ...3

I don't.  &nbsp; I'm just glad I'm getting out past my office building now, lol. &nbsp; //sneeze &nbsp;  3 days.   &nbsp; *sigh*

We might go out to lunch, we might not. Whatever.  &nbsp; My parents can never know, lol, or I will be shot in the ass for it. They'll kill me.  &nbsp; But I don't really care, he's MY friend, not theirs.  &nbsp; Hmmm, I kinda wanna go for a walk. I wonder if they turned on the alarm yet or not.  &nbsp; I just wanna be alone with the sky. I like feeling small. It's as if all my problems are nothing, compared to that sky that I love to stare at. I'm just a small, miniscule particle compared to it. I want to feel like that, maybe it'll make me feel better. I just need to clear my head. Lay out under the stars and just breathe the night air...and know that there  can  be peace, and there  can &nbsp;be a break from the spinning my mind has been doing.  &nbsp; I don't really&nbsp; know why I feel this way.  &nbsp; I am a fucked up individual. I fill my life with unnecessary stresses and discontent...but for what reason? I always feel as though I am meant to fail, and I am not good enough to succeed.  &nbsp; I want to hurt myself. I want to feel pain. But why?! &nbsp; It's like my life thrives on the shit you're supposed to hate. &nbsp; Fuck. I can't find my scissors.

      Wee, I'm home now finally!! &nbsp; Yay :) &nbsp; My mom tried to convince me she was pregnant. I ALMOST believed her.  &nbsp; ALMOST, is the keyword, and thusly why it's in caps.  &nbsp; meh, doesn't matter. Anyhow... &nbsp; I saw Angel today too. He hadn't seen me in YEARS, and he had no idea it was me when I walked into the kitchen to see my mom, lol. It was rather amusing. :D &nbsp; I love it when people don't recognize me, makes me feel good, haha. I've accomplished looking GOOD since the end of puberty.  &nbsp; I almost got a pedicure today, but didn't have the money in cash. I have my paycheck, but I'm going tomorrow to set up a checking account and put it in there. And I'll keep track of it this time, lol, I promise.  &nbsp; I think I'll get one tomorrow, hmm. We'll see. I'm in desperate need, lol. I hate it when my nails aren't done. I feel so icky, I won't wear open toed shoes. I know, that's dorky, but I can't help it, I'm very self conscious of my feet. Always have been.  &nbsp; Need to call Cameron. Need to talk to him period. I IMed his cell phone today, but what I got back was just jibberish from my computer, so text messaged him on my phone and asked him to repeat what he said 'cuz the computer garbled it, but he never responded. I guess he was busy. *sigh* &nbsp; I'm such a moron, but why am I having doubts about it? I shouldn't be...he loves me... &nbsp; I need to not think about it so much. If I do, I'll assume something that isn't true. I just want him here. I need a hug from him, I would feel better if I got one.  &nbsp; ...4...

      Woot, Incubus at work :)  So I got back late from lunch. There was a huge line at the Bon Ton check out, and then I saw Megha, and I hadn't seen her in a few months so I had to talk to her. She's going to Brown University in the fall, which is awesome for her :)  So that was cool. Even though I have to stay later. I got new thongs, lol, to replace the ones my mom threw out. And a new denim skirt and two new shirts I think. I'd have to actually check the bag, but I left it in Carissa's car. I didn't need my mom seeing my new undies, lol. Not. her. business.   I got a shirt that says "I wish I could Ctrl+Alt+Delete you" :D  I also bought a lot of pink. I don't know why necessarily. Infact, I used to hate pink. But I've been doing a lot of putting pink and black together. Hmmm...maybe I'm becoming more *gasp* GIRLY?!?!?!?!111one  Oh good Lord I hope not.   I got my pacheck!!! 466.38, I believe :)  I feel so...I dunno, lol, it's just really cool. I've never had a paycheck before, it feels good to actually earn my money instead of just having my parents give it to me. I'm spoiled, lol, so this is good for me. But I've never had an issue with having to earn my keep with anything.   In other news, I am bored, lol.  I'll probably post again before my day is through.

      streaming radio at work is a beautiful thing.   I slept more yesterday than usual, but I still couldn't get up this morning.   I hate that.   I'm also breaking out into pimples on my face. Red ones. Ick. They're so gross.  I think it's 'cuz of my lack of a sleep schedule, they say that sleep deprivation causes break out.  They also say that depression/stress can do it to. Well I'm not really stressed.   But I've been feeling really shitty as of late, so who knows.   *sigh*  I just want to go back to bed, but I look on the brightside. There's a really awesome sale at the Bon-Ton today, and I'm going during lunch, lol. That might make me feel better, I need new shoes anyhow.   In other news, 4 days yay!!!!!  I think I miss him a lot, and that that's why I feel so crappy. I'm used to seeing him and talking to him.   Meh, I need acne stuff.   I hate people. You can all go fuck off now >:O

In other news, Cameron comes home in 6 days, yay!!!  aaaaaaand I'm tired. But thats nothing new. I went to bed at like 10:30 last night, I was so exhausted. But I felt so much better this morning. Although I woke up, and I had duck lips for some reason. My upper lip was kinda swollen, it was wierd. //shrugs  Meh, it still hasn't really gone away, but whatever. Maybe I'll end up with Angelina Joile lips, that would be sweeeeeeet, lol.   My boobs will never be that big though, and I'll never be that tall...but hey, whatever, lol.   Time to go make more copies *sighs again*  More when I get home if I'm not tired like I was yesterday.

It's red leather and huge, I love it. :) We saw it yesterday in JCPenny's, and it went onsale today, so she went to get it with my dad. This was around um...10ish I think, so I just went back to sleep.   Movies tonight with Cam? I think so...we'll figure it out. That would be good.   I had really wierd dreams. In one, my dad almost caught me watching my porn. In another, I was at school...they were so strange.   Anyhow, I'm gonna go wake my ass up in the shower or something soon.

Aww, how sweet is that?  *rolls eyes*  Anyhow, so I didn't get anything at the mall. Nothing. Which is odd for me, usually I get SOMETHING. But I'm going back Sunday, and I saw a bunch of stuff I wanted, and stuff for my room.   I wanna order my laptop in the next couple weeks, so I can fiddle with it before I leave.   I am tired, so I am going to bed soon. I got up at 2...how the fuck am I tired?  PS: KRISPY KREME MAKES THE BEST DOUGHNUTS EVAR!!!!11111111111

       On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care  When I'm angry, you listen Make me happy is your mission And you won't stop til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast Well, I hit that bottom Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...    Sometimes, I can be such a pop culture conformist. I hate myself for it, but at the same time, I don't care, because I am in the mood for this damn song...over...and over...and over...:D

      I feel so strange, not being out of the closet in the place I work.   I realized this today. There is one other girl here who is remotely my age (she's 21) and she's a close friend of the family, like my mother is her sister and brother's godmother, etc. And we've become pretty um...I guess you could say close as I started working here. And well, sometimes we get on the subject of homosexuality. And I know she wouldn't really judge me, and she would accept me, but it's still a scary thing to do, to tell someone, "I'm bisexual". It's not like I'm saying, "I'm really a man!" or something, but it's hard nonetheless, and it drives me nuts, 'cuz I just want to say it sometimes, and I can't. The fact that I also find her kind of attractive is also probably a factor, but I would never tell her that, lol, that would just be wierd. Although I'm sure she wouldn't mind it necessarily, lol, she'd probably be flattered, but I mean really, she's known me since I was a tiny baby, how do you tell a person who's so close to you something like this?   I hate hiding things. My own mother knows, and she doesn't say anything to anyone necessarily, but I mean she knows, and she accepts me for it, for the most part. It's my perception that she kind of sees it as a "phase"...but when she found out I had had girlfriends, and that I had been um..."intimate" with other girls...she realized that I wasn't just going through a "phase".  Maybe one day I'll just blurt it out, lol.  I remember Ms. Franks talking to me about how when she came to Cheshire Academy, she had to go back in the closet. She had been out of the closet for so many years, but she suddenly entered this environment where she couldn't do that anymore. It might have put her job in jeopardy. When she finally came out, and started to bring her partner around the school more, I was so happy for her. She felt much better once she did that, and I could tell, she looked more comfortable.  Now she and her partner are having/had a baby. I haven't been updated yet, but her partner was pretty far along the last time i saw her. I hope everything went well, and that they finally chose a name!  But I digress.  I suppose in this setting, I mean, these people are older, and um...I don't know accepting they would be versus Carissa, who is 21 and open minded. I could tell Carissa...I couldn't tell the others. I don't know how I could show my face around here anymore if I did. Maybe when I'm a little older, I could say something...not now.   *sigh*  I don't even know why it's bugging me. I just, wish it were easier to be yourself in the world, no matter what differences you posess in comparison to others.   In other, unrelated news, my boss has left for the day, so I'm slacking off now, lol. I have to send her an e-mail before I leave though, but that's at like, 4 o'clock, and then I get to pick up Cameron :D  Yay :)

      I have a headache this morning. It's really a light one, barely noticeable, but I am noticing it, and I spent a good five minutes just rubbing my temples, it subsided for about thirty seconds, and then came back, a little stronger too. I think it's the tension in my neck and shoulders. I need a massage...really bad. :-/  Listening to  Velvet Revolver  at work, go me :D   I am annoyed. I can't find four resume's that I need to make phone calls...I might have given them to my boss inadvertently in a pile of copies. *sigh* but she's in a meeting, so I've gotta wait.   thank God my day off is tomorrow, I am tired. I need the sleep. I get paid again soon, yay :D  I think I figured out what I wanna get Cameron for his birthday, teehee.  (I know he reads my blog sometimes, so I'm not saying anything!)  Back to trying to find these resume's...uuuuck

      Thank goodness I'm home now. I had a little stomach ache, but it's gone now that I ate something. I took another nap when I got home. I didn't mean to. I hate napping, I can't get to bed before 3. I just want to sleeeeeeeep.  In other news, I talked to Cameron today, not on the phone, but while I was at work. He's ok. He'll prolly come over for dinner at some point within the next few days, which is nice, I haven't seen him since sunday and I miss him. So that's good. :)  My eyes are still stinging. In fact it's more of a constant stinging than one might think. I think that my eyes are therefore permanently tired, which sucks my ass, but oh well. My sleep schedule is fucked.   I'm gonna go shower now, since when I came home I totally crashed on my bed...again.   //"won't you let me explode, in a karaoke supernova..."  woot Ben Folds *rocks out*

       //rocks out in my head   Another boring day. I had to be in at 8 this morning...ugh. My mom had a meeting uber early, and as such because she is my only ride, I had to suffer.   Ugh.   It was teh suck.   Then, she told me she was going to wake up earlier, 'cuz I usually wake myself up at 7 to get ready by 8:45. Nope. Got up at 7...couldn't shower. I feel so gross. As soon as I get home, I'm bathing, lol, I feel gross. My hair is gross, I hate how my skin feels right now, I feel so greasy. I look fine, but I hate how I feel, know what I mean? I've gotten so used to getting up and showering that now if I don't and just get up and get dressed, I feel disgusting.   Ick.   So anyhow, I haven't talked to Cameron since yesterday at 6. He never called me back, he hasn't txt me back today either. I am a little worried. I'll call him when I get off work, see if he's ok. I don't wanna bug him, but I wanna be there for him and make sure that if he needs anything that he can just ask me. I hope he's ok.   back to work...*sigh*

      Ate lunch. I feel better now. :)  Still listening to  Maroon 5  on repeat. I hope I can get tickets to see them with John Mayer. Last year they played with Jason Mraz, and I missed it. But they're in town while I'm still here...we'll see.   Am worried about Cam. I hope he's okay. I'll call him in a little while, no, I'll send him a text message. I don't want his phone ringing while he's at work. My mom made me feel a little better about it.   If you're all wondering what the hell it is, you can ask him if you know him, 'cuz you're not getting it out of me.  Back to work I suppose.   //sings in my head, "my heart is breaking in front of me..."

      At work early in teh morning. My eyes are still stinging, meaning I'm still kinda tired. I'm playing Maroon 5 in my headphones via my iPod, and it's good. All pirated this morning, lol. I love quick downloads, God Bless DSL, :D  In other news, I feel like driving. Right now. It's a shame I do not have access to the car. Oh well. What I lack in a vehicle...well I can't really make up for that, because I won't have a car for awhile. Meh.   My boss just came in, oi. I wonder if it's really okay that I do this during office hours. Oh well, I'm sure it's not a huge deal.   mmmm, damn this song is sexy, wooo! I just want to shut the door and dance to it.   That's not a bad idea, maybe during lunch I'll do that.   More in the afternoon when I can think clearer with more coffee in me.

      Aaaah, work again. Alas, my weekend is over.   Oh well.   On my lunch break now, not eating with everyone, I feel like reading my book. I wanna go to Barnes and Noble today and buy a new Bible. Mine is really beat up, and I want to start reading it again. I read most of it in my Biblical Studies class, but there parts we skipped that I wanted to go through. I want my own nice copy. My mom's really nice copy, with the sliver page lining and the leather binding is hers, it was a gift, I can't take that. Besides, I want the little one that I can keep in my purse.   Cameron suggested that I read  Left Behind . We'd talked about it in class, but I had never read it myself. I want to watch the movie too. Hmm, maybe I'll pick that up too.   I have a small pile of books piling up that I wanna read before the end of the summer. I'm almost done with  Girlfriend 44 , this book I started reading about a year ago that I never finished. I picked it up right where I left off, and I still remember most of the story I had already read, which was good. I'm almost done with it now, just a few more chapters, and then I'm on to finishing  In the Bedroom .   I'll finish my Hitchikers trilogy last, since it has the most books in it (six all together).  *sigh* back to my iPod and my e-mails.

      Saw Cameron, it was good :)  Saw  I, Robot , that was good too :)  Now I'm home reveling in the goodness that was tonight.  He told me about his trip. He even got me a little stuffed animal moose from Canada :) He knows me so well. Or atleast remembered that another nickname of mine is Moose...whichever.   He's such a sweetheart, I'm so glad he's back. I think I can last without him in college, this whole thing has told me so. I got used to it, well not used to it, but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be, and I had no real desire to cheat, or be with someone else, and that's kind of...a first for me. Even when Ed was here, while I didn't want him to go, I had no desire to cheat on Cameron with him.   I think I have matured.  Go me   //does the 'go me' dance  In other news:   I, Robot  was good.   Any movie with an opening scene in which Will Smith is naked in a shower is damn good for me :D

      Holy crap,  Pride and Prejudice  was fucking. amazing. I loved it, every second of it.   Wade and Katherine get my "teh awesome actors" award, I was sooooo into the whole story, it made the book seem SO interesting, and I hated the book, lol. I saw everyone, Sternie, Rawlings, Rebecca, I was so glad I got to see them all!!   *sigh* I missed them so much. I wish I had come back. Maybe next year.       Definetly next year. ;)

      I'm on a Maroon 5 kick lately. I don't really know why. I finally have the whole album, and I love every song. So...yeah I can't help it, heh.  I couldn't post this morning, I was so busy today, putting binders together for my boss for next week. I'm almost done though (yay), tomorrow I've just got a couple more things to photocopy, then I'm good to go!   /stoked   Greg: I just realized I haven't talked to you in two solid days. Not good. :(   Awww, I felt so special after reading that today, lol.   I (heart) you Greg, :D  In other news, I saw  The Brighton Beach Memoirs  last night, TEH FUNNY!!! And I saw all these people I hadn't seen in forever, it was just fantastic, I loved it. So did Cameron. I didn't realize how much I really missed the Foote School until that night, and I was sitting there watching, and I felt so odd not being up there. The set was AMAZING, it looked as if someone had cut a house in half, and you could see into the house like that. Like those old Polly Pockets, where you'd open the little compact, and see all the rooms, the stairs, hallways, things like that. There were two stories on the set, an upstairs and a downstairs, and it was just absolutely amazing, I hadn't seen anything like it. Insane props to set master Frank Alberino for that, once again he designed something incredible, and it was fabulous. Those techies are daaaaaamn good, lol. Except Travis, but we won't go there right now, :P  Tonight,  Pride and Prejudice !! So excited to see what THIS set looks like, and to see everyone else and, oooooooo it's going to be so cool, I am teh excited!!  I better go shower and get ready, yay!

      This is the song of the day: :D  Maroon 5, The Sun    After school Walking home Fresh dirt under my fingernails And I can smell hot asphalt Cars screech to a halt to let me pass And I cannot remember What life was like through photographs Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past  And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met you Take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain that I have Gone through And mama I've been cryin' Cause things ain't how they used to be She said the battles almost won And we're only several miles from the sun  Moving on down the street I see people I won't ever meet Think of her, take a breath Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met you Take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain that I have Gone through And mama I've been cryin' Cause things ain't how they used to be She said the battles almost won And we're only several miles from the sun  The rhythm of her conversation The perfection of her creation The sex she slipped into my coffee The way she felt when she first saw me Hate to love and love to hate her Like a broken record player Back and forth and here and gone And on and on and on and on  This song brought to you by...me.   //dies

      Aaah, after lunch, when I only have two more hours before I head home, oh joyous!  I am going tonight to see  The Brighton Beach Memoirs  with Cameron at the Foote School. I am teh excited about it too, I can't wait to see Mr. Schlusberg and Mr. Lerner, oh and Claudia and Kimmy and, oh man I am so stoked, lol. I'm going to be sitting there the whole time going, "I should be up there, wtf I should totally be up there on stage", but I think I needed this summer to work and do something different. Alas, I can do theatre at Purchase, I'm not worried about losing out on stage time, I just miss the feeling I get being on stage, it's like nothing you ever experience in your life, it's fantastic.   *sigh* Aaah the theatre, 'tis such a fleeting artform. I love it :D  I was looking at pretty diamond rings last night while I was on the phone with dave, that was fuuuuuuuuuun, lol. They were so PRETTY. If you want to design your own diamond ring, go to http://www.adiamondisforever.com and design your own engagement ring, or your own threestone diamond ring. It was so much fun, lol. Then I searched similar ones that they showed...SO GORGEOUS, some of them were amazing.   I decided awhile ago that I wanted a real claddagh ring as my wedding ring. I don't really care that I'm nowhere near Irish, I want one, lol.  I'm not talking about anything really relevant today, I'm just kinda bored at my desk. Procrastination is a fun sport, I think.   More later when I get back from the play, I have some coalating (sp?) to do.

God update for the morning:  God is being nice today, this I appreciate. :)  Thank you, God :D  I'm so annoyed that  Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle  isn't playing anywhere near me!!! It's so upsetting that I'm going to have to go into New York to see a movie. >:o  So frustrating, :P  In other news, there is no news, too early.

      Aaah, another monday and I'm at work, oh joyous.   Although I'm much more focused today than I ever was last week. Last week I wanted absolutely nothing to do with this office, or this place. I just wanted my bed. Now I feel better :), atleast I can work properly and get my shit done, although now I'm feeling kind of behind, but I'm sure I can catch up by the end of wednesday with everything I slacked off on.  My new cellphone is still pretty, and still awesome :)  I'm still engaged to Cameron, still don't know if he was serious, but I'm still finding it amusing to think about. ;)  and I'm still feeling peachy keen. It's not a bad morning.   Carissa bought my mom a shirt that says, "You're Not The Boss of Me" She's wearing it right now. I have a feeling she'll be wearing it all day, lol.  I brought salad for lunch, we'll see if I actually eat it today.   In conclusion, my morning is decent. :D  More in the PM.

      I am tired, but in a good mood :)  I got a new cell phone today, finally!! The Samsung sch a-670 is now in my possetion, woo!!  It's so cool, I can take videos, pictures, send picture messages, I downloaded ringtones. I have downloaded "Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand, "Cold Hard Bitch" by Jet, "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen and "California" by Phantom Planet. :D  I went bowling tonight, as the night progressed I got better. I actually got a strike and a couple spares if I remember correctly, which was good. Cameron got four strikes, two of which were in a row, which was pretty sweet. Dos Equis, lol.  He asked me to marry him. I said yes. Whether or not he truly meant it, I dunno, but it's fun to pretend sometimes, lol.   He seemed to get along really well with Daniel and Camila (my god brother and sister) who we went with, along with Carissa and their mom, and Katrina, who's also their sister. That was good. He was being touchy feely, lol, which I dunno how they reacted to it, but, I didn't mind, it's just how he is with me. I like it, for once I don't have to initiate anything. It's a beautiful thing.  I took a picture of him on my phone, it's now my backround on the phone (everyone do it with me now: "awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww").  All in all, a good night :)

      I woke up three times this morning. Atleast I got up before 1 this time!  I ate a donut from Krispy Kreme for breakfast. Shit do I feel fat now. I hate that. But damn, that strawberry filling was good. I'll regret it, infact I do, I should've only eaten half. But daaaaaaaaaamn. I guess that means no lunch for me! Oh well.   Today I get my allstars!! Yay! Well, atleast I hope I get my allstars today. I don't really have a lot of money on me at this point in time, and I refuse to take any out. The 400 in the bank STAYS in the bank.   My confusion still stands, but that's later.   Tonight I'm going to see the  Brighton Beach Memoirs  with Cameron and possibly Dewey. Should be fun :D   In other news, I need to make my bed, it's fucking bugging me again. gah!

      So yeah, 'twas my gramma's birthday today. :) That was fun. Family came over. Was good.   Cameron came over around dinner time, stayed until about 10. It was nice. I had missed him. I hadn't seen him in about a week, so I was glad he could come over. Apparently, I'm going out with him and Andrew tomorrow, but that's not official. Since I haven't seen Andrew in forever, this would be a good thing. :P  More later, I'm on teh phone :)

I can't believe it's almost here. I've been waiting four years to finally move out of my house and be on my own. And now I'm doing it in almost two weeks. I'm scared, and nervous, and really really excited all at the same time.   I dunno what I'm going to do with all that freedom, lol.  In other news, I have to re-format my iPod. Teh suck. Oh well.

      I have two opened and half full cans of Moutain Dew on my desk. I'm so wasteful, lol.  I am also very full, and when I say full, I mean my co-workers forced me to eat a lot more than I normally would have. If I hadn't, I would've had the grand inquisition on my ass. That would have been annoying. In conclusion, anorexia does not fly in this office, no way, lol.  Not that I am anorexic by any means. I don't have the kind of discipline it takes to be one, and I hate throwing up, so I can't be bulemic. And I hate dieting.   And if you think I would even TRY and exercise...wow you've got another thing coming honey, lol.   In other news, NPR is good. It makes me feel like the world is still moving and going, even though I am stuck in this little room all day. I like hearing the news, I feel connected to the world.   Carissa and I ordered shirts from  Google , on the back they say "I'm feeling lucky"  Once I get it, I'm wearing it all the time. I don't even own it yet, but I have already decided that it is my second favorite shirt. My first favorite being my Incubus shirt, of course. I love that shirt. :)  Okay, I really do have work to do, I swear.   PS--I GOT MY PAYCHECK!! WOOTNESS!!

      Aaah, work. It's especially boring when you've very little to do. I'm updating a contact list, and making mailing labels...but once I'm done with that I have nothing to do until I leave in a couple weeks. I must say, it's nice not having to worry about work and such, but I can't just sit here and do nothing. It would be wrong to get paid for literally sitting here and doing nothing.   I've discovered NPR on WMP...mainly because there are very few other streaming radio shows or playlists that work on WMP 7 for a Mac. Oh if only I had Mac OS X, but that would make this computer run SO SLOW it's not even humorous.   My mom admitted that she's being really harsh about her reactions to me still talking to Ed. We're going to discuss it later. Maybe it will be a step in the right direction. I hope so. This is the only thing we fight about anymore, and I don't like to. But I won't back down. He's my friend, I won't  give him up just because she's holding a grudge towards him. If she has an issue with him, she should call him and settle it, not punish me for it. He's never treated me badly, atleast not intentionally.   *sigh*  I hope it all ends up okay.   Anyhow, back to my contact list. Oh joyous.

      I have come to realize, that iTunes can become very addictive. I've bought three albums in two days. Thank God I get paid tomorrow, or I'd never be able to pay for it. So I've bought:  The Killers-Somebody Told Me  Franz Ferdinand- Franz Ferdinand  Interpol- Turn On the Bright Lights  Stellastarr*- Stellastarr*   Yeah, I had fun. :D  I am going to take Greg's advice, and buy the Fiery Furnaces' new album,  Blueberry Boat , it looks really good, and got an awesome review on the Pitchfork. It'll be my last one for awhile though, atleast until my next pay period, lol.   In other news, I do believe Greg is slowly turning me into an Indie lover...damn...I never thought I would see the day.  Finally, I am quite tired, and at work. I think I luncheon nap is in order.

      Yeah ok, so I was late leaving my house, and since I was late, I couldn't go see the movie, because I have work tomorrow, thus I couldn't get home late. Blah. So I suppose I'll see it at some point this week. *sigh* But I did spend some time with Cameron, we just hung out at his house, which was still eventful, lol.  Came home, sorted laundry, listening to  Franz Ferdinand  (woo!)  Meh, could've been worse. I could've spent my night at home, that would've been really boring.   Relaxing now. Said good-night to Cameron. Might read my book.  In The Bedroom  is a very good book, as it turns out. I'm on story two, and it's getting very interesting. I need to see the movie. Yay HBO on Demand. :D  I'm done babbling now. :)

The Stills are a complicated case, though, inspiring equal amounts of pleasure and horror, like that dream in which everyone has mozzarella genitals.    I mean seriously, not only is that fucking hilarious, but it helped me in  not  purchasing that album. Also, I bought Franz Ferdinand on iTunes, and yeah, Pitchfork rocks my socks off for that. :D  //rocks out  Anyhow, going to see  Harold and Kumar  in a few, a review when I come home :D

      Purchase FINALLY got my transcript today, and it looks like they're still going to take me, even after my nearly abysmal grades in the last quarter of school. Thank you JESUS!   I feel SO much better knowing that that's over with.   In other news, I also called and found out my room assignment/who my roommate is. Her name is Tara Basciano, and she lives in New York. (EDIT: I originally had down Pennsylvania, 'cuz I saw the wrong area code, silly me.)  I'm going to call her tonight I think. I'm living in a 7 person suite, with a living room and stuff I guess, but each bedroom is separate with a roommate. Niiiiiice. Now THAT is exciting. But 7 people...shiiiiiit, I told Carissa, and she said to me, "Good luck with THAT one."  Somehow, that just didn't seem encouraging. Oh well. I'm sure it will work out okay...I hope, lol.  Today when I get home, I have to do some work for my boss on my computer. *sigh* Oh well, atleast I'll have awhile, 'cuz usually when I get home I just do nothing. I'll nap for a bit and then get it done I guess. That'll be good.   Yay, it's been a pretty good day so far. :)

      Wow, that song has been stuck in my head since last night when I went to go and see  Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle , which was a hilarious movie, btw. :)  I don't really have the time to write a review, as I am at work, but I will say that it is teh funny, and you should go see it if you haven't already.  In other news, my mother isn't speaking to me, which makes for a rather uncomfortable work/living environment. I think she's going through her hormonal stuff, which is just dandy, seeing as I'm leaving soon too. It comes at SUCH an opportune time, doesn't it? *sigh* I don't want to go into specifics, but essentially, she's mad at me for being selfish.   I dunno.   I'mleavingsoonI'mleavingsoonI'mleavingsoon...  Back to work, I've got mailing and such to do.
