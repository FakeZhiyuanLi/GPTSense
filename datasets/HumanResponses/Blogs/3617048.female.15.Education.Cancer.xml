         Wow time went by fast! Tomorrow is my birthday! A lot has happend since the 13th. School is finally out! I'll be going to Evergreen High School after summer vacation. And I can SLEEP IN! I've been so tired that I was falling asleep in my classes! But amazingly I have been on the honor roll for the whole year! The pool is OPEN! YEAH! I have been dying to go swimming in this heat! Can't wait to get my ears pierced on Thursday w/Jessica and Rose. However, Rose just told me and Jessica that her mom's day off is Thursday and her mom now wants to come along with us to the mall too! NO WAY! My mom is already taking us and she said that if Rose's mom is coming, then she's not taking us at all! I agree. Rose's mom was pretty mean to Cynthia when she told on Rose for pushing her.(She acctually made her cry!)AND........ Rose told me that her mom told her that she doesn't like it when Rose walks w/us to the library n' stuff because she thinks that me and Jessica act like we're so cool and that we dress up all pretty just to go to the library! That is soooooooooo not true!!!!! I think she's just jealous!!!!!!! That made me so mad! I told Jessica and she didn't like it either. We don't dress any different from the way we always do which isn't trying to be "PRETTY!"   HOW RUDE!

         Yesterday I went to my Grandpa's wedding! (Yes, my "Grandpa.") It was at a super fancy country club called "Glen Acres" and it was beautiful! I was all dressed up and wore make-up and heels!I (looked great.) It was a good thing we brought our digital camera too! I got to see many of my relatives that I haden't seen in years. Especially my favorite cousin Brent! We practically grew up together. You should have seen the ladies lounge! It was carpeted and had couches and bathrooms and even showers! My little brother told me that in the mens lounge they had a pool table! I had an amazing time, and I got to meet a lot of new people. I even cought the bouquet of flowers that the bride throws. But I doubt I'll be the next to get married since I'm only just turning 15 in 10 days! I had so much fun that I didn't wan't to leave. I'm going to remember that day forever!
