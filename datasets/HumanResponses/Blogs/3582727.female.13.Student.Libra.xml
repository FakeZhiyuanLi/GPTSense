      My life has come to a standstill. (Or has it always been at a standstill?) I know I have goals. I even know that I have plans to achieve these goals. But I'm just not sure what they are. I know that they exist, just beyond the realm of my consciousness, and that all I have to do is seek them and I can pull them from the corners of my brain out into the open. I just haven't done it yet. I know there are things I want to do with my life, and I have a vague idea what they are, but I haven't put in the simple effort necessary to organize my thoughts and dreams and actually begin to realize them. Each day I think,  I should write something today , but then I find myself spending another day and night sitting at the computer and accomplishing nothing. I think of it, but I tell myself, "No, wait 'til tomorrow. It's too late now; you can spend all day tomorrow on this." But I never get to it. I want to make something of my life, I want to change the world, but...but I'm afraid that I'll never actually  start  anything, and I'll end up just like my parents: holding boring jobs in office buildings, working a standard eight hour day, hating my job but lacking another option. Lacking the discipline to build another option.   But what the hell is the point of sitting here  blogging  about this? Why not just get off the computer and actually  start?  See, that's why I mean. I'm just so messed up right now. I'm such a procrastinator, that I almost will myself to continue putting everything off until the last minute. But when you don't have a deadline for something, there  is  no last minute, so you just never accomplish it. You end up achieving only the minimum. I don't want to live the bare minimum.  Ahh! Help me! I'm losing my mind!

      I guess I've always thought that while people were quite different from me, they all led similar lives. But it just now occurred to me that  not everyone's like me . Which is weird, because I've always regarded myself as somewhat unique, you know. Not at all like the average person. But I've just never really thought about it. Many people--maybe most people--are actually social, active people leading busy, eventful lives. People actually  do  things everyday. People actually have self-confidence and -esteem. People actually  like other people . People are actually  happy . I don't know why this is such an amazing realization for me. It just is. What a dumb revelation.   I wish I could live life like that.

      I was just talking with my dad, and we had the following exchange:  Dad: I feel like I can really relate to you. Because you're very intelligent. Me: Yeah, and you can relate to Andy because he likes sports. Dad: He's very intelligent, too! Me: Haha. Good one, Dad. Dad: Well, he is intelligent, in his own way!  Haha. I love when I get my parents to say that kind of thing about my brother. It just makes my day.  Until I forget about it and it has absolutely no effect on my day after all. Hm.

      This evening, I went to my twenty-something-year-old cousin's house for a family barbecue type thing. Oh, how I love family get togethers.  Sarcasm doesn't show up in print. Darn.  It's really annoying to be a vegetarian at a barbecue. Especially with my family, who seem to live to torture me. If I have children, I promise that I will  never  purposely humiliate them or piss them off in social situations. Mark my words.   Right before we went home, we had a stupid group picture taken. I can never smile in pictures. I can't smile unless I'm truly happy. Needless to say, I was not truly happy at the moment. Anyway, the woman who was taking the photo told me that I needed to smile. I was  trying  to smile. She said, "You're so serious!" When will people stop mistaking unhappiness for solemnity?   When we finally left, my cousin said something along the lines of, "It was nice to see you, Elm." It was understood by everyone that he was joking. Elm being good company? What a ludicrous idea! Elm's not fun! What a great joke! I hate my family. Every last one of them. And they seem to hate me right back.   On a lighter note...Nope, I got nothing.  Current...

       urlLink VW  and I just wrote a screenplay called  From Ruben to Clay . Oh, I love that idea. We worked on it for ten hours, only taking breaks to eat and sleep. We even chose people we know to play each part. Of course, it was a spoof...and we thought it was pretty funny at the time. Or at least I did. Of course, when we read it over (out loud and to my mother, no less) we realized what it was: stupid. Really, really, patheticly stupid. Ten wasted hours. I feel like such an idiot.

      Today I went to the beach with Kate. It was kind of cloudy and a little windy, but it turned out alright. There was a group of girls near us. Three of them buried the other one...and gave her little piles of sand as boobs. It was pretty funny to watch. So, of course, we buried my brother. And we gave him boobs. It was pretty great.   Yeah, that was my day. I suppose I could go into detail, but I don't really feel like it. It was a good day, though.

      Ever since I promised to start writing about important things (by which I mean actual political or religious issues and such), I have avoided writing in my blog. And now that I have returned, I still do not intend on writing much of anything. Not right now. This is mostly because two of my friends are online right now, so I'm a little distracted from really writing much of anything. But I want to write  something . So here I am.  I think I'll just skip to the current things.  Current... Reading material:  1984  by George Orwell. TV show on:  My So-Called Life . Don't get me wrong, I don't seriously like any show on The N.  Daria 's kinda fun, though. Mood: Kind of blank and empty. But not in a bad way. Attitude toward summer: It's growing kind of boring and repetitive. But it's not as though school isn't always boring and repetitive, so don't get the wrong idea. Thing I want to do right now: Nothing! What's up with that? Things left to write about: None.

      I was going to submit my site to another blog directory, when it hit me: I don't write about anything in my blog. Sure, I write pretty often, but...I don't write about anything of any real importance. I should probably do something about that. Hm.

      This is what happens when you drink 120 ounces of pop in one day:  "It would be great if I had some sort of health reaction. I mean, a good health reaction. Like, what if I grew a whole bunch because I was so carbonated? CAR-BON-A-TION!"  (Singing) "Carbonation is the key to a new philosophy..."  (When trying to say, "When Megan gets back from camp...") "When I get back from school vacation..."  I think there was more, but I forgot it. Yeah,  urlLink VW  on ten cans of Pepsi. You should see it. Who needs TV when you can have VW on ten cans of pop?

       urlLink     "Linking to us will give your site the opportunity to attain rankings in our  Most Cool  section!"   So advertising their site makes my blog cool? , I think.  Interesting...  Then I go to Blogarama's list of Most Cool Blogs, and I see that  the  Most Cool Blog just happens to be a pornography site. As though that isn't enough, this blog is a pornography site with a rating of one out of ten. Yes, there  is  a list of highly rated blogs, but all the same I can't help wondering,  What is the world coming to?

      I love that despite my blog description, my entries so far have been neither random nor particularly pointless, I haven't come across as being exactly insane, and reading this really isn't all that risky. Whatever. I tend to exaggerate things. Or just completely make them up. Either way.  I just ate a salad. A  salad , of all things. But it's a nice experience, strangely, sitting around in your dark house in the middle of the night, eating salad. Try it sometime.  Today was pretty good. High levels of insanity, mosquito bites, apologies to pieces of furniture, and a well-planned lie here and there. Ah, summer, when it doesn't really matter whether it's the weekend or not. Summer, when the days go by slowly and you  like  it. Ah, summer. Summer, summer, summer.  I think I must be very tired right now, though I don't feel it. My sleep schedule has been altered greatly from a few very late nights and even later mornings, so now I'm all messed up. My mind seems tired, though. Then again, I think my mind's perpetually tired. I should try to go to bed now.   Speaking of sleep schedules, I want to be nocturnal. I really do. You know, just for a week or so, as an experiment. It seems like it would be very interesting. I'm certain it would work out just fine: I would eat breakfast when my family eats dinner, I'd fix myself lunch around midnight, and I'd eat dinner when my family eats breakfast. I'd just have to force myself to stay up for a long time to make the transition. Sure, I'd hardly be able to  do  anything, but I could live like that just fine if it was only a week. All in all, it sounds like a great idea to me. But I asked my dad, and he said no. He didn't even consider it! Yeah, so it's not exactly surprising for a father not to allow his daughter to  turn nocturnal ... Oh, leave me alone.  Yes. I am tired. Definitely.  Current... Song in my head: Oh, that crazy techno thing that VW's sister listened to in ninth grade, the one with the "lalalala"s...yeah, bad song Taste in my mouth: Italian dressing and gingerale Most annoying compulsive habit: Checking blogs Attitude toward life: Confused, though accepting of the fact that life confuses me and will always confuse me Mood: Relaxed and content, though not particularly happy

      I'm going to reply to Siri's comment here instead of by email. And Siri, it's good to know that you appreciated our comment. Very good to know.  First, I'm not trying to find the meaning of life. I'm pretty sure there  is  no real meaning, and we're all just sort of... here . I'm just looking for a way to make life a little more tolerable, that's all.  No, I don't believe in fate. I don't believe in any sort of plan or supreme force, actually. I think that life is just a series of coincidences--nothing happens for a reason. If we all had a predetermined destiny, what's the point in even living? That would mean that our choices didn't matter, right? But of course they do matter. I don't like the idea that we can't build our own life and future. What do you think?  Hm, this is interesting. Right now, VW and I both seem to be focusing on self-actualization. But it seems to me as though a person must return to safety/security and love/affection once they move out and begin life on their own. And I haven't yet properly fulfilled my need for esteem. I think VW is a lot further with that than I am. Right now I'm more or less ignoring the lower needs (except for the fact that I do still breathe...) and planning for self-actualization. I like doing things out of order. Even though it usually doesn't work very well. Hum.   VW wants you to comment on  urlLink her blog .

      Life is confusing. People are confusing. I'm so lost right now that I'm not even sure whether I'm lost or not. I'm not sure if I'm actually on a path and I just don't know it. I'm not sure if I have a purpose, if I have several purposes, or if I'm just sitting here wasting my time. Where the hell am I? What am I  supposed  to be doing? Is there anything I really  can  do, anyway? You can't recognize that you are lost if you don't know where you should be.   Yeah, I'm posting a bunch of entries all at once. It's kind of weird. For awhile I had no idea what to write. Guess that changed. Anyway, I haven't actually written about the events of my day, so if anyone cares or is as hopelessly bored as I usually am, read about it in  urlLink VW's blog .  Ha. I love how I write in this as if I have a big group of random internet strangers who have stumbled upon my blog since I made it just a few days ago and now loyally check up on me every day. Yeah, right. I know that VW reads this, and Kate probably does. And then there's that Siri character, who only comes here because VW and I very randomly left an extremely long comment in her blog. Oh well. I don't know what I expect from this.   Maybe I should just comment on strangers' blogs more often...

      Yeah, I'm just feeling all symbolic today. So, in Cedar Rapids there is a park called Bever. In the center of this park is the very popular Bever Pool, which I consider to be a blemish on the otherwise beautiful landscape. Damn man-made structures. Anyway, the pool is a relatively small part of the park, yet nearly everyone who visits Bever does so for this pool. To me, this perfectly symbolizes the priorities of today's teenagers. The vast majority of them take their money and go to the pool, buying into all that is normal, popular, and common. They are caught up in conforming to society's standards of the "average teen", focusing on that small, trivial detail of the park and missing the bigger picture. Only a select few are wise enough to see past the moment, see past what is commonly accepted and realize that there are far more important things out there. Only a few see the rest of their lives and what they wish to do with them--the others care mostly about themselves, the people around them, and what they can see with their own eyes and in their near future.  There is a tall, wrought-iron fence surrounding Bever Pool. Are  you  inside the fence?

      Time for a corny metaphor about the progress of the human race...  So, the world is a train. A hundred years ago, this train was moving very slowly. As time progressed, humans worked toward making everything faster, more efficient. So our train starts speeding right along. Faster, faster, faster. When a hundred years ago a person would've looked out of their train window and seen the beautiful landscape, having time to notice each detail, our modern passengers see the world only in a blur, noticing and therefore caring about nothing important. Faster, faster, faster.  And you know what happens when a train starts going too fast?   It crashes.

      So  urlLink VW  and I were talking with my brother today, and he happened to tell us which of his friends have kissed and which have made out. (Fortunately, none have gone further than this.) Oh, I should probably mention that my brother just finished sixth grade. See, neither VW nor I have ever  dated , let alone made out. Is this sad? It sort of seems like it must be. But don't get me wrong--I'm not actually  bothered  by this realization. It just kind of made me think. Then again, Andy also made several mentions of girls liking so-and-so Tuesday, but the next day, liking someone else, and such. How can these people's feelings fluctuate so drastically day to day? So, in that way at least, I guess VW and I are a little more sane than most of the McKinley student body. Maybe a lot more sane.  Today, VW and I got up early (around eight...which isn't really early, but it's not exactly pleasant when you've stayed up until about two) and went to my grandparents' house. Ah, my grandparents are insane. My grandma's under five feet with short frizzy hair, and she's...insane. That's truly the only way to put it. Anyway, maybe I'll write about my grandparents sometime else. Maybe not. But now, more about my day.  We went over to work on sanding my new bed which my grandpa recently finished building for me. This took only about a half an hour. So we spent the rest of the day sitting at the computer, skimming random blogs (in one case, more than skimming), and being bored out of our minds. At around noon, though, my mom picked us up and took us back to my house.  A couple hours later, we decided that we wanted to work on writing a song for our band (if anyone has suggestions for a band name, tell me). I have a piano, but we got it very used and very old, therefore it kind of sucks. So we decided we wanted to go to VW's house instead. The problem was that I didn't have my key and therefore could not lock the door.  How to escape? , we pondered. We finally devised a plan.  Okay, so it was more of an impulse than a plan. And I have this way of making things sound a lot more exciting than they really are. So don't be disappointed. We spent about a half hour forcing open the old, rusty, jammed door in the basement. I'll give a condensed version, since I sort of want to finish this soon: We finally opened the door, only to end up back at my house within the next hour. We didn't even  go  to VW's house. Oh, and at one point we crawled through the window at my dad's house...twice, actually... Yeah. That's all.   There's a dead animal in the frying pan on my oven. It looks disgusting.  Current... Thoughts: none.

      Why is it that all of these middle aged TV moms worry about aging and wrinkles, when really they look exceptionally young, and all of these TV "reject" teen girls think they're ugly, when really they're enviably pretty with beautiful red hair? Okay, so maybe that last detail's specific to  My So-Called Life ... But you get the picture. Crazy TV.

      Yeah, it's summer break, and today has been one of those awesome summer days that you'd like to live over and over again. Except that I'd probably get sick of fettucine alfredo after a few days. But anyway.  My morning was fairly unremarkable and dull. I sat around at the computer for awhile, doing practically nothing. Then I ate a bowl of cereal. Exciting, I know.  At around 1:30 or 2:00,  urlLink VW  called, and we walked to Bever Park. Of course, we brought enough carrots to feed each of the cows, burros, and goats at the zoo. As it turned out, goats don't particularly care for carrots, but pigs do... Yeah, it's against the zoo rules to feed the animals, but rules are made to be broken, right? A zoo employee was walking around cleaning the pens, and he kept glaring at us as though he were suspicious...but for the most part it was simply funny.  Next, we alternated swinging at the playground and running repetitively through the fountain in the kiddie wading pool. It was pretty great. Boy, do we know how to have fun. Seriously, all of those other crazy people at the real pool, paying about five bucks just to hang around in the crowded pool, especially when there's a huge grey cloud hovering over the park. Brilliant. Why do that when you could be running through a huge sprinkler with the little kids (who kept disrupting our fun by sitting on the fountain. Kids...)? I swear, I'll never understand it.   Yeah, VW and I are great in that we're partially mature for our age, partially childish for our age, and hardly at all like the regular teenager. You know, we care more than the usual thirteen-year-old about political issues and the like, and we have much more serious and less shallow conversations...yet at the same time, we'd much rather be splashing through the kiddie fountain fully clothed than be in the pool with all of the rest of the kids from school, tanning in our tube top bikinis with our hairbrushes and cell phones nearby. And I hope that didn't sound as though we actually own tube top bikinis. We don't.   After Bever, we walked through the rain to the Grant Wood Elementary School playground, where we kinda...stood around for awhile. When we were about to leave, this dog came running and barking toward us. At first we were petting it...then we realized that it was barking an unusual amount, and it kind of looked as though it were foaming at the mouth (it was hard to tell because of the rain)...so instead we ran for our lives. Kind of.   Anyway, we went to my house for awhile, and then we went out to dinner. Oh, dinner. So VW was apparently really,  really ,   REALLY   hyper. She started rambling about the fact that her school ID number--130791--is kind of like her birthday--01/07/91. So she spent the next half hour or so rambling and rambling about how  my  ID number--128425--connects to my birthday--10/11/90. Her logic was very...interesting. I won't go into it here, for it was rather complicated and entirely insane. But I'll just say that I had quite a deal of trouble eating and drinking at dinner. It's hard to eat or drink when you can't stop laughing. VW's great that way.  We came home, and now VW's spending the night here. She called her mom to ask for permission, and she found out that her grandma has cancer in her heart and/or lung, which can't be removed. It's the most awkward thing when your friend starts crying in front of you, and you really have nothing to say to help them. I mean, what was there to say? I feel so terrible for her. And the thing is that I can't quite properly comprehend it all, since I've never really known or loved any of my grandparents. They're just those annoying, crazy people who I have to visit every once and awhile. But I can imagine, and I do care. So this seemingly perfect day ended in a very depressing way.   My kitten's in heat. It's really annoying and kind of gross. And rather amusing. But that's all for now, since VW's still here...I figured it would be okay to update, since she updated hers earlier, but I think I worked on this for much longer than she worked on hers.   Current... Mood: Helpless and guilty Knitting project: Dark blue tank top TV show on:  Daria  on the N Biggest worry: VW's grandma Song in my head: Fefe Dobson's  Revolution Song  Taste in my mouth: That disgusting flavor that comes after eating too much sugar...I just had a ton of jelly beans  Okay.

      So I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up posting a ton of entries on the first few days and then eventually just stop writing altogether. I get excited about these new things. But then they get old fast.   But anyway.  I was reading  urlLink VW 's most recent entry, and I decided to write my own thoughts about that. If it's sad for VW that her grandmother is having health problems, I can't even begin to imagine what it's like for VW's dad to see his parents like this. I guess my parents have been pretty lucky so far. My mom's mother had some minor heart problems awhile back, and my dad's father had surgery done on his heart a couple years ago...but generally, they seem to be in good health. It must be really depressing to get to the age when your parents start dying. Again, I couldn't imagine.

      I know that no one wants to read this, but I'm facing some problems with writing in this blog. The main issue is that it's on the  internet , where anyone could see it. No, that's not really it--I'd be perfectly fine with spilling all of my secrets if I knew that only perfect strangers would discover them. The problem is that my  friends  will read this. Some of the biggest things in my life right now would end up making somebody very angry.  urlLink VW  probably knows what I mean.  Oh, why can't we all just be honest? I'm sure the world would make a hell of a lot more progress--for the better or the worse--if we'd all just be brutally honest with each other. Why does life have to be this tangled web of lies? Why must we put on masks in public, while complaining and ranting behind the backs of others and secretly fuming with anger when we're alone? I hate  hiding  things.  But I can't just go right on ahead and be brutally honest in this. I'd like to, but as long as the rest of the world is caught up in secrecy and deception, I'm afraid I must follow suit.

      That's exactly what this here blog is. I'm still not entirely sure why I created this. No one will read it. Well, that's not true--a couple close friends probably will, and I know that the occasional random stranger will probably stumble upon it. But now I'm going to stop writing about writing. Ah, I'm so terrible at this.  I really don't have much of anything to say right now. See this as an introduction to my blog, and expect slightly more interesting entries in the future. Right now I'm having trouble properly controlling my brain. Don't you hate it when that happens?  Well, I think I'll take a leaf out of my friend  urlLink Kate's  book and add some random current things at the end of each entry. Maybe not each entry. Maybe weekly, or something. So anyway...  Current... Favorite color: Green, mostly because I've recently discovered a new appreciation for nature. New good CD: Fefe Dobson. It's not really new, but I just started listening to it. Favorite place to be: Bever Park, probably. Most people go there for the pool...but I prefer the children's zoo and the swingset.  Reading: Actually, nothing. If anyone has recommendations, let me know. Mood: Lazy yet restless...it's a rather frustrating mood.  Well, that's all for now. Leave me some comments. Or don't. I don't really care either way.

       It's below seventy degrees outside today, which is extremely cool for July in Iowa. I suppose most people would be disappointed, but I like it. It's kind of chilly, but I'd rather it be this way than humid like it has been recently. I just wish it would rain...     &nbsp;   When I went to California for spring break, I bought a pair of sky blue shoelaces with little yellow ducks on them for four dollars at the San Diego Zoo. Today I tried to sell them to my brother for sixteen dollars. No, that's not accurate; he tried to  buy  them from me for that price. Yes, my twelve-year-old brother wanted ducky shoelaces. And he would've gotten them, too, if he hadn't gone and mentioned the deal to my dad, who wouldn't allow his son to waste his money like that. Really, I think if my brother wants to blow sixteen bucks on something worth a quarter of that amount, that's his prerogative. I had nothing to do with the price; in fact, he  raised  it from twelve to sixteen dollars for no apparent reason. See, my brother's the type who pays ninety dollars for a get-out-of-jail-free-card when we play Monopoly... But no. My dad wouldn't allow it. Oh well. I kind of wanted those shoelaces.     &nbsp;   I finished  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  on Thursday. It was okay, I suppose. I didn't like it at the beginning, but it got better toward the end. After that I read  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  by David Sedaris, which was hilarious. I finished that last night, and today I started  The Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger, which is good so far.     &nbsp;   Heh, speaking of David Sedaris, here's an amusing little exchange between VW and my father:     &nbsp;   VW: Oh, I'm in love with David Sedaris...    Dad: You know he's gay, right?    VW: Yes... (sighs, looks disappointed)    Dad: Have you ever seen his sister Amy Sedaris?    VW: No, I don't think so.    Dad: Oh, she's really funny.    VW: Is she gay too?    Dad: No, I think she's straight.    VW: DAMN! I just can't win!     &nbsp;   Heh, VW seems&nbsp;awfully desperate to be a part of the Sedaris family...     &nbsp;   Hm. I'm darn sure I had something to say, but it escapes me. Meh. Basically, my summer is what the typical person would call "boring", but it suits me just fine. And life goes on.

       So I find that Blogger posting has changed since I last wrote. I can now change the font, size, and color. And somehow it's disappointing that those things were already just how I want them.     &nbsp;   Oh well. This is nice. Woo Blogger!     &nbsp;   I usually separate my thoughts into separate posts, but now I'm going to put them all into one. So it'll sound very scattered and fragmented, in all likelihood. Well, that's the best way to represent my brain, anyhow.     &nbsp;   First and foremost, I have decided that I want to be a writer. Not so much because I'm any  good  at writing, or even because I particularly enjoy it. It's just that if I could be absolutely anything, a writer is what I would be. I like the idea of it. But I tend to dismiss such ambitions as hopeless fantasies. But then I realize that I've got five good years ahead of me before I have to actually start my life, so I might as well use them to write. Who knows? Maybe...it'll work... Oh, who am I kidding?     &nbsp;   Anyway, I registered at  urlLink http://www.fictionpress.com &nbsp;and posted a couple of poems that I wrote a few months ago. If you want to read them, go right on ahead:  urlLink http://www.fictionpress.com/~jharpergreen .     &nbsp;   July has gone by very quickly. I find it hard to believe that summer's so nearly over. I'm not completely dreading school, though I know I probably should be. See, sixth and seventh grade were both horrible, so I keep thinking that eighth grade is  bound  to be good, right? But then, if my first two years of middle school were shit, why would the third be any better? Ah well. It'll happen soon enough, and I'll just find out then.     &nbsp;   My mom, my brother, and I had an interesting conversation about deoderant the other day. My brother is...not one for hygiene. He's probably used deoderant about twice in his twelve years of life. And trust me, he needs it. It was really hilarious, though -- you know, one of those conversations that I'd just  love  to have on tape. He doesn't quite understand the  function  of the stuff... He kept saying things like, "Well, why can't I just take a shower when I smell bad?" Oh, yeah, take a shower in the middle of school... It's a mystery to me that the boy's actually quite  popular...      &nbsp;   I think I'm a little italics-happy. It's just nice to be able to use ctrl+i like I always do on Word. ...That hasn't always worked on Blogger, has it?     &nbsp;   I love the movie  Orange County.  The message seems to be something like: "People are stupid no matter where you go. There is no escape." Too true.     &nbsp;   I want to see  Supersize Me.      &nbsp;   VW's neighbor was in  Pillow Talk.  My dad and brother didn't believe her, but it turns out she wasn't lying at all. The neighbor's name is Lois Rayman, and we're thinking she was Tony Randall's secretary. Not that anyone should reasonably care. Hm.     &nbsp;   Okay. There's a very random entry with no flow whatsoever. A writer, indeed.

      I really have nothing to say, but it's been awhile since I've posted so I thought I'd check in. You know, just in case anybody thought I had died. Maybe some currents, just so I can post  something  of substance...  Oh yeah! I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11  on Saturday. I absolutely loved it (despite the footage of mangled Iraqis, during which I had to stare at the exit sign). It was really strange, though, when the manager of the theater made a little speech before the movie... He talked about how it was controversial, and then he had a  raffle  for popcorn coupons. It was quite odd. I bet his theater was bringing in a lot of cash for being the only one in Cedar Rapids whose manager is not in bed with the Republicans, as my dad puts it. Sure, Michael Moore's an asshole. But he's a really awesome asshole.   GRR I HATE BUSH!  Ahem.  Now, currents.  Current... Reading material:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  by Betty Smith. I finished  To Kill a Mockingbird  and then read  Animal Farm  by George Orwell, both of which were very good, of course. Knitting project: Still that stinkin' tank top. I finally finished the back of it. I just don't knit very often. Whatever. Odd food craving: Cheese quesadillas at Fiesta Del Sol.  Current...current...AHH! I swear my brain has disintegrated. Plus, it's before eight in the morning and I only got about three total hours of sleep, probably (I've been staying up late and sleeping until around one lately, and for whatever reason I am now trying to break this habit). I'm now at the phase of sleepiness when I'm just really hyper. I have trouble thinking when I'm this way.  So there, an entry, if not a very coherent one.

        My computer has only been working on and off for the past couple of days, so I'm taking this opportunity to write. Not that I've got anything to write about. I'm extremely bored. And once school starts, I'll still be bored, only in a different way. As you can plainly see, I have a lot to look forward to.  Ten days until school starts. It seems like an eternity. A very, very short eternity.

          I am very angry at myself. I've been getting up at a reasonable hour for the last few days, but today I slept until noon. And I don't see why, either; I went to bed around midnight last night... I think my bed's a little too comfy for my own good. Hm.      I already linked to this site on my team blog, but it has been making me very happy, so I thought I'd mention it here:  urlLink www.tiedyes.com . It's got tons of liberal, anti-war clothing, buttons, stickers, bookmarks, and more.       This is an excellent blog:  urlLink mwilder.blogspot.com . I agree with most of the things he says.       That's all for now.

          The Unkymood is "thoughtful", though it seems to mean considerate while I'm feeling more contemplative. So that's what I mean, just to clarify.      I didn't realize how long that last entry was. Oh well.      Thirteen days 'til school.

          I just found my old Buddy4u profile from sixth grade. It included this list of "Life's Questions and Answers", which I have decided to answer again. I am including my answers from sixth grade.       For a person you loved deeply, would you be willing to move to a distant country, knowing there would be little chance of seeing your friends or family again?    Then:  Nah, I couldn't stand never seeing my friends again, and if some dumb guy's just gonna move away, he probably doesn't care that much, anyway.    Now: Before I go traipsing around the world with this guy, I'm going to make him part of my family. And once he's part of my family, this question makes no sense, so it can be ignored.       If you were to die tonight with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven't you told them yet?     Then:  If there is something that I want to tell someone but haven't, it's probably because it's somewhat secret, so therefore I am definitely not about to post it on the internet for anyone to see.     Now: Yeah, things that I'm not going to post online for those exact people to read. And I haven't told them because I'm afraid of their reactions.       If you could spend one year in perfect happiness but afterward remember nothing of the experience, would you do so?      Definitely.     I'm not so sure now. What's the point, really? Anyway, if I were in  perfect  happiness, I'd have to be pretty ignorant, wouldn't I? But if I were truly in perfect happiness that would mean that all wars and slaughter had ceased, in which case I'd take the year of perfect happiness if only because it would be a year's worth of people and animals who would not be killed.        If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the body or the mind of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?      I'd say mind, because having the mind of an old granny scares me, unless I'd be a cool old granny anyway, in which case I'd choose body, but then I'd look like a freak, and nobody would believe me about my age...I'd say mind...     I'm assuming that I could still learn and gather wisdom with my thirty-year-old mind, but just that I will always remain as sharp as a thirty-year-old. If this is the case, then I choose mind. Otherwise, I choose body.       What would constitute a "perfect" evening for you?      The beach. Or the woods. Hmm.     Hell if I know. Though the woods is good. Very good.       Would you rather be extremely successful professionally and have a tolerable yet unexciting private life, or have an extremely happy private life and only a tolerable and uninspiring professional life?      A happy private life, definitely, but I'd like both if I can wangle it.     I hope that my professional and private lives will not be so distinctly separate. I want one to affect the other, and I want them both to be wonderful. Or at least that's my way of getting around the actual question.       Would you be willing to become extremely ugly if it meant you would live for 1,000 years at any physical age you chose?      No way, I'd hate to live for 1,000 years under any circumstances. I'd just get too damn tired.     It has little to do with becoming ugly, but I'd hate to live that long. I would, however, like to check in every once in awhile. Just to see how we're coming along.       If you could wake up tomorrow with any new ability or quality, what would it be?      Hmm...I'd want to read people's minds...except I'm not sure I really want to know what people are thinking and what people think about me; I'm probably much happier not knowing. So don't tell me. ;) But really, I'd want to be able to become invisible. Yeah.     You know, I didn't even consider any  natural  abilities. Hm... I'd wake up tomorrow and be an absolutely brilliant writer.       You have the chance to meet someone with whom you can have the most satisfying love imaginable. Sadly, you know that in six months, the person will die. Knowing the pain that would   follow, would you still want to meet the person and fall in love?      Yes...I think.     Probably not. I don't think I could take that.       Do you prefer being around men or women? Do your closest friends tend to be men or women?     Depends on the occasion. My closest friends are all girls.     My friends are still all female. Guys kinda suck. At least at this age they do.       Have you ever hated anyone? If so, why and for how long?      I have never really hated anyone, and I don't believe that you can say how long you hated someone, because I think that hate is something that lasts forever, otherwise it's only intense dislike. I have intensely disliked several people.     I now have a new outlook on hatred. The way I see it, I can both love and hate a person, and it can come and go with time. People change. They're so complex, that it's impossible to love or hate every aspect of one of them. So, right now I hate in some way every one of my friends, family, and everyone else I know.        If you knew there would be a nuclear war in one week, what would you do?      I'd tell everyone everything that I've always wanted to tell them but been afraid to, and I'd do everything that I want to do but am afraid to. I'd have as much fun as possible.     I'd try to stop the nuclear war, of course. I mean, I've got nothing to lose...       If you knew you could devote yourself to any single occupation--music, writing, acting, business, politics, medicine, etc.--and be among the best and most successful in the world at it, what would you choose? If you knew you had only a 10 percent chance of being so successful, would you still put in the effort?      I'd be a great singer, definitely. I know I have less than a 10 percent chance of being so successful, but I'll still put in the effort, because I love singing.     I'd want to find some way to change the political world without actually being a politician. I'd be an activist, devoted to some important cause. Probably anti-war. And I'd love to write as well. Of course I'd put in the effort. What's the point of living otherwise?       Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be?      No clue. Probably whatever's closest, I don't want to risk anything.    Oh, gosh, I still don't know. Perhaps whatever's most expensive while still being easy to save, however materialistic that may sound. I don't believe I own much of any sentimental value, so why wouldn't I go for the thing that would cost the least to replace? It's simple logic.     When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?      I've sung to myself within the last 5 minutes or so, and I've sung to someone else in the last 24 hours, I think.     I just sang to myself a few minutes ago -  Imagine , by John Lennon - but I haven't sung to another person in quite some time.       If you could choose the manner of your death, what would it be?      Either doing something exciting, such as skydiving or bungee jumping, or murder, so maybe I'd make the news. Hehe.     Oh, dying peacefully in my sleep... But if that's not really a fair option, I'd die for a cause. I'd die fighting for what I believe in, corny as that may sound. And I don't mean in a war - I hate war, and most of them don't seem to be worth it anyway - but in a different way. Some different way.       Do you have any specific long-term goals? What is one, and how do you plan to reach it?      I want to be a singer. I'm not sure how I'm going to reach it, and I highly doubt that I am going to reach it. But I guess I'll keep writing songs and stuff.     No, not really. I'd like to have some, though.       For what in your life do you feel most grateful?      I don't feel particularly grateful for much in my life...except my friends.     The air in my lungs. But if you want something more sentimental, I'd still go with my friends.       If you could have free, unlimited service for five years from an extremely good cook, chauffeur, housekeeper, masseuse, or personal secretary, which would you choose?      Hmm...either a cook, a chauffeur, or a housekeeper...I'm not sure.     Hm... A chauffeur seems extremely unnecessary. A housekeeper would be helpful, but I don't really want anyone poking around in my stuff, and it'd probably be best for me to do that myself or else I'd be really lazy after the five years were over. A masseusse would just be...weird. And a personal secretary seems pointless. So I'm definitely going with the cook, even though I don't see myself as ever having or really wanting servants of any kind. I would like some good healthy vegan meals, though.       Would you enjoy spending a month of solitude in a beautiful natural setting? Food and shelter would be provided, but you wouldn't see another person.      No way, unless I could communicate with other people, in which case I would enjoy it.     Hm, kind of a  Walden , eh? I'd probably miss people pretty badly by the end of it, but I love solitude, and I love nature, and - please!? Oh, that'd be perfect!       Would you like to be famous? In what way?      I'd like to be a famous singer.     I'd like to be a famous activist sort of person, or a famous writer. Preferably both.       Which of the following restrictions could you best tolerate: leaving the country permanently, or never leaving the state in which you now live?      Never leaving the state, although that would be awful.     This one's tough. I really can't decide.       Is there anything you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?      There's nothing I can think of right now.     Again, I can't think of anything at the moment, but I'm sure there are countless things that I could list. And I haven't done them because I'm a loser. I never get anything done.       What are your most compulsive habits?      Being online all the time, but I'm getting better!     Hm... the Internet, putting off my homework until eight or nine at night, and shutting off my alarm clock every morning.       What do you most strive for in your life: accomplishment, security, power, love, excitement, knowledge, or something else?      Exciting, secure, powerful, knowledgeable, accomplished love.     Of the listed options, knowledge - but I want that knowledge in order to accomplish change in the world.        You are invited to a party that will be attended to many fascinating people you've never met. Would you want to go if you had to go by yourself?      If I wasn't doing anything else, then why not?     Probably not. But it depends on what is meant by "fascinating people" - if they were fascinating in that they shared my interests and beliefs, and therefore I was sure to get along with them, then I'd jump at the opportunity.       Since adolescence, in what three-year period do you feel you experienced the most personal growth and change?      Ahem, I'm not through adolescence...but anyway, the last three years.     That doesn't quite apply to me. And of course I'd say the last three years.       If you were happily married and then met someone you felt certain to bring you passionate, intoxicating love, would you leave you spouse? What if you had kids?      If I met someone and felt sure that they'd bring me intoxicating love, I obviously wasn't happily married in the first place.     Hm... Exactly how happily married am I? If I would clearly be much happier with the other person, then I might consider it, but not after a complete divorce. I'd never have an affair or just run off. If I had kids, then I probably wouldn't leave my spouse, as long as I'm happily married.       Who is the most important person in your life?      One of my friends.     One of my friends, still.       Do you support capital punishment?      No.     I'll still say no, though it's a rather complicated and tricky issue.       If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?      Ahem, I'm still being raised...but regardless of that, I'd make dad pay more attention to me and my interests, and I'd make mom more responsible.     I'd stop my dad from favoring my brother, I'd make my mom more responsible, and I'd probably want a slightly nicer house. Oh, I didn't even think of this - my parents wouldn't be divorced. They wouldn't be divorced, but they wouldn't argue either.       If 100 people your age were chosen at random, how many do you think you'd find leading a more satisfying life than yours?      'Bout 70.     Probably around forty. Not that my life's particularly satisfying - quite the contrary - it's just that I'm sure it's considerably better than the lives of teenagers in third world countries. I'm actually rather fortunate, I guess.       Someone you love deeply is brutally murdered. You know the identity of the murderer, who is acquitted. Would you seek revenge?      Some sort of revenge, but I wouldn't kill them, because I wouldn't want to go to jail.     I wouldn't want to do anything too rash. Killing the murderer wouldn't bring my loved one back. But I'd try to find some way to get the killer convicted...       What do you value most in a relationship?      Fun, good conversation, and trust.     Deep understanding and shared values.       Do you judge others by higher or lower standards than you judge yourself?      Lower standards.     Lower standards, generally.       If there were a public execution on television, would you watch it?      Only if I had nothing better to do.     Of  course  not.       What things are too personal to discuss with others?      Things that I won't list here.     I'm obviously not going into detail here, but probably some deeper emotions, and a lot of doubts and questions that I sometimes have...       Would you be willing to do something very unsatisfying (e.g., clean toilets) for the next five years if you were certain that the experience would afterwards bring you a deep sense of personal fulfillment for the rest of your life?      For the next five years, I will be in school, which, frankly, is quite unsatisfying. So yes.     Well, there is the school thing, but I think I'll actually answer the question this time. Yes, I'd clean toilets for five years if I'd have a deep sense of personal fulfillment for the rest of my life. What's five years out of a lifetime, anyway?       How many times during the day do you look at yourself in the mirror?      'Bout five.     Four or five. I mean, really, it's right in front of the sink...       Would you prefer to be blind or deaf?      Blind, because I couldn't stand not being able to hear music, and being blind would make me less judgmental.     This is hard. Right now I think I'll go with deaf. The world (at least in it's natural form) is so beautiful, and sometimes I take my vision for granted. I'd hate life without it.       What does it take for you to trust people?      I don't fully trust anyone. My most trusted friends have been known to betray me and tell my secrets. Grr.     I wouldn't really know, since no one's ever gained that trust. I don't think you can ever fully trust a person. But you can trust them a satisfactory amount.       Of all the people close to you, whose death would you find most disturbing?      Probably one of my parents'.     I'd still say one of my parents', not because I love my parents more than my friends - I don't think I do - but because the death of a parent would affect my life so drastically. Once I move out and begin life on my own, I expect this to change.      Well, that's all I have. These are from  The Book of Questions , so I hope I don't wind up in some sort of copyright trouble. Hm.

        I really am just about ready for school to start. Summer's getting boring. And that's saying something, since I think it takes a lot for me to be bored. I really have nothing to do. Well, I  could  work on knitting that tank top that I haven't worked on for months, but... And I could continue reading  Dubliners , but... Blah. I just don't want to do a damn thing. So I guess I want school, if only because it'll give me something to do. Even if that something happens to be the last thing I'd choose to do if only I could.  Again, blah.  Fourteen days 'til school.

        I bought school supplies today, realizing exactly how frustrating school shopping can be. They never have exactly what I want... For instance, the only folders that had binder holes in them were ones with really stupid pictures and plain ones that only came in about three colors. Yeah, I'm one of those crazy people who like to organize all of their stuff by color... So that worked out pretty crappy. But it's not like it really matters.  The only messenger bags they had at Target were an olive green canvas one and a blue one which was pretty ugly. I got the green one, which I really do like, only it's a little small. But it is more or less what I wanted. I'm just afraid that when I get more stuff in my trapper and my bag that things won't fit well at all.  Hm. Time to stop thinking about school.  Unfortunately, I haven't got much else to think about. So I guess it's goodnight.

        Yesterday morning I went with  urlLink VW  and Megan to Panera for lunch. ( urlLink Katio  would have come, too, but she was still asleep when we called, the goose.) It was nice because Megan's mom left us there alone while she shopped for around an hour, so we could talk for awhile. Megan had to go to a volleyball camp that she is in after lunch, so VW and I went to her house. It was a  beautiful  day outside, so we sat around in her driveway talking for most of the afternoon. I spent the night there. Today Katio joined us at VW's house, and we had a shaving cream fight (read: we mostly slathered shaving cream all over ourselves since the canisters didn't spray very well). What a crappy idea. I had a ton of it in my hair (which I admit was an incredibly stupid thing to do), and that made it really disgusting afterwards. I've already taken two showers since I got home around five-thirty, and my hair's  still  a mess. Plus it took a long time to clean up VW's driveway. We're never doing  that  again.  So, I've had a relatively busy couple of days. At the beginning of the summer, VW and I hung out just about every day, but for mostly all of July I've just been hanging out at home by myself. I really love being alone, but it was nice to see my friends again (I hadn't seen Megan all summer, I don't think, and it was good to see her before she left for New York, where she'll be for the rest of the summer). But now I'm back and as lazy as ever.    A packet from school came in the mail yesterday. Unlike in sixth and seventh grade, eighth graders are not divided into houses, so there wasn't much to find out from the packets. All I know is my homeroom, which I fortunately share with Megan, and a list of teachers (not necessarily mine). We don't get our actual schedules until the first day, which is the twenty-third, so I won't know until then whether I get classes with my friends or not. I'm excited. I don't really want summer to end, but I'm always happy about the first day of school.  Tomorrow I'm going shopping for school supplies, and hopefully clothes as well. I'm not really big on clothes shopping or anything, but I like to have new things to wear when school starts. Not that I actually plan an outfit - I think that's silly - I just like new things. Mmm. Anyway, I also like new things when it comes to school supplies. I don't know why, but I love them. New notebooks and pencils... Ah, happiness. And I'm going to buy a messenger bag for this year instead of a backpack, on which I will pin the "Some village in Texas just lost it's idiot" Bush button that VW so generously gave me. Thank you, VW.  I've joined a team blog called The (Informed) Youth of the Nation. We've just started it, but it should be about politics and the like. I'm rather excited about it. Check it out:  urlLink informedyouth.blogspot.com .  Well, I believe that's all I have to say, and my self-imposed summer bedtime is nearing. Remember, I really do love comments and chatters, so if you want to make me happy, please post one of the two, preferably both. And if you do not want to make me happy, do it anyway. G'night.

        My mom just finished painting my room.  I think it looks pretty nice. It's pale olive green. I wanted it to be a little darker, but it works. My new bed isn't here yet, but my mom did make navy blue curtains. Which are...darker than I wanted them. Hm. How peachy.  My template's really screwy on my mom's computer. About a third of the way down the background becomes really dark green, and the last third of the page is medium green. And the quote, which should be at the bottom, is on my sidebar. For a moment I was frightened. But no, 'twas only my damn computer.   I was pretty darn sure that I had something else to say, but I can't remember what it might have been. Oh well.  I've been a mighty good Blogger recently, haven't I?

          Storm last night. Lots of lightning, lots of thunder, but next to no rain. I'm disappointed. I love rain. But it  is  cooler, which is very nice.       I'm trying to fix my sleep schedule to something fairly normal. I've been staying up until around two in the morning recently, and sleeping until at least noon, and it's been bothering me. So I tried to go to bed around midnight last night, but I wasn't yet tired at all, so I slept horribly. I did manage to get up at eight today, though, so I'm awake, if not very well rested. Hence the sleepy Unkymood.      Oh, I do love my Unkymoods.       So I decided to go over to the playground at the elementary school which is adjacent to my house and run for about thirty minutes. Well, mostly I walked. I'm really terribly out of shape. The track at the school is a little over a quarter of a mile, and I can just barely run around once before I'm completely exhausted. And to think that I could fairly easily run two and a half miles when I was in fifth grade... So I'm trying to work out a little now. I always feel really weak and wimpy, and I'm tired of that.      So, I got six hours of sleep (at most), and then I wore myself out by running (a quarter mile). I'm now both sleepy and just plain worn out. What a great feeling.       About an hour ago, Andy's friend Will called to ask him if he wanted to go to his house and "mess around with" a bee hive in Will's back yard. Andy accepted the invitation. Wow. My brother and his friends are real geniuses, aren't they? I can't  wait  'til he gets home, though. I need a laugh.      I changed the style of my Chatterbox. Those of you who saw how it was before, tell me which one you like better. I think I might be leaning toward the new one, since it has a scroll bar so you can see old messages. The other one just deletes them. Plus the font's smaller on this one, and I like that.       Well, I think I'm going to go read for awhile or something. Tootles.

          I just added Unkymoods, a Chatterbox, and a ticker. Which means I actually had to edit my template. Which is something, considering I don't know one bit of html. But, after much frustration, I was triumphant.      Go me!      So, chatter in my Chatterbox, and make me a happy little girly.      ...Please?

       I hereby promise that I will post at least once every day. Well, nearly every day. I will seriously try. Because I realize that it's hardly good that my July archive has a grand total of three entries. My, my...       urlLink www.googlism.com  - This is pretty amusing. Last night I was going to post my googlism here, but I had to eat dinner in the middle of it, and when I got back my STUPID MORON BROTHER had turned off the computer. I...wasn't pleased. Anyway, I'd post it again, but I'd have to insert all the returns between the lines, and also I cut out about half of them because they were repetitive and boring. So if you want to see mine, check it out for yourself - and if you know my real name, that one's probably better, since it's...not a tree.       Now, what to ramble about next?      I finished  A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man  last night. It was...alright. But it's definitely not going on my "Favorite Books" list. I'm fairly surprised that it was ranked third in a poll of the best novels of the twentieth century. Maybe I'm just not old enough to fully appreciate it... I don't know. Whatever. I'll start  Dubliners  today.      My dad was on vacation starting two weeks ago tomorrow, and today is his first day back at work. I'm glad. For some reason the days seemed much longer when my dad was home. I much prefer it when he's not - I'm not quite alone, but my brother's not nearly as annoying on days like this then when he's with my dad. Also, I've been at my dad's house (my parents are divorced, if I haven't already mentioned it) for his whole vacation, and now I really feel like I've been here too long. Which, is funny, since a lot of people only have one house, obviously... But I miss my cats, Flower and Pickle, and my new old school Super Nintendo. Oh, and I haven't seen my mom in awhile. Hm.       New old school. Heh. What I mean is that we just bought it off of eBay a few weeks ago for thirty-four dollars (plus shipping and handling). Not bad, huh? Plus it came with five games.       Anyway, I'm really looking forward to going to my mom's house on Wednesday. And honestly, it's not because I miss my mom. Not at all. It's mostly because I miss my cats. They beat out my mom any day. Also, my mom was planning on painting my bedroom while I was at my dad's house, so that should be...interesting, at the very least. And my grandpa just finished building a lofted bed for me, so that should be in my room now. Yay. Happy room.       Okay, I think I've seriously bored you for long enough. I'm pretty much out of things to say, anyway. So, farewell, my friends. And my acquaintances. Acquaintance. That's a pretty word. Hum...      Ergh. Jacob Roy just IMed me. Why?!

       I really should post more often, shouldn't I.    For the past month or so I've been doing virtually nothing but reading, sleeping, eating, and the occasional visit to the Internet. Oh, laziness, you are my friend. But I feel like I should be  doing  something... I just can't figure out what I want to do. Hmph. Oh well. Anyway, that more or less explains why I haven't been blogging: there's honestly nothing to write about.     That being said, something vaguely interesting actually  did  happen on Saturday. My dad and I were sitting on the couch watching television when we heard a strange slapping noise from our enclosed porch. We went to investigate, and what did we find? At least seven or eight raccoons, a few of which were actually looking through our glass door. Now, one would expect that as soon as my dad turned on the porch light the raccoons would scatter, right? Not so. They actually walked  closer  to the door. They were  cautious , sure, but certainly not frightened. It was really crazy. My cat, Lil Z, was out on the porch with her front paws up against the door, staring the closest raccoon straight in the face. A little background info on Lil Z: she  never  bites, scratches, hisses, growls, or anything like that. But when she saw those raccoons, she figured she might as well give that whole hissing thing a try. It was pretty funny. She wasn't very good at it - it sounded more like wheezing. Anyway, the raccoons eventually got either scared of us or bored with us, so they retreated and hid under our front steps. At this point, my other cat Zoe came out to the porch. She bent down and sniffed at the crack beneath the door, caught the scent of the raccoons, and abruptly jumped up and  slammed  her front paws on the edge where the metal part of the door ends and the glass begins, if that makes any sense whatsoever. She did this about three or four times, making a surprisingly loud  buh-dum  noise each time. It was hilarious. Unfortunately, the raccoons did nothing more than poke their heads out from under the steps after that. On the plus side, though, my brother was out with friends and missed the whole thing. Poor loser. (...Let's ignore for a moment the fact that I'm probably the loser here if I'm all excited over  raccoons , instead of actually hanging out with friends...) Yeah, that was the highlight of my Saturday.    I'd like to take this time to share with you a conversation between my dad and my brother which I found to be rather amusing:     Andy and Dad are watching TV, and a birth control pill commercial comes on.     Andy: Why don't cats have periods?    Dad: Well, they do, if they're not fixed.    Andy: But...why don't they have periods?    Dad: They  do.  They go into heat and stuff.    Andy: Yeah, but why don't they poop blood?     At this point Elm begins to mercilessly mock Andy.     Dad: There is some blood spotting, yeah.     Long pause.     Andy: So why don't they make cat tampons?    Dad: Would you really want to insert...    I'm sure I've pointed this out before, but I'll say it again: yes, my brother is twelve.  Twelve.  Golly gee whiz. Poop blood...    So, I watched most of the Democratic National Convention, unlike most people my age (and probably Americans in general), I'm sure. I'm crazy that way. But I am pretty interested. (For some reason I just had a crazy bit of deja vu, by the way.) I still don't actually  like  Kerry all that much, but I dislike Bush enough that it really doesn't matter. Oh, can we really endure four more years of Bush? I shudder just thinking about it.     The best part of the convention was, without a doubt, when Kerry's daughter Alex told about the time that Kerry performed CPR on a hamster. (Sadly, it was not mouth to mouth.) Seriously, people,  that's  the kind of person we want in the White House. Agreed?    On a completely different note, I had no idea until recently that JoJo is thirteen. I just figured she was a really small seventeen-year-old or something.  Thirteen.  I mean, seriously, that's like a little  baby.  Oh, I remember when I was thirteen... Ahem. Yeah, that was pretty random, but I just thought I'd share.    The movie  Footloose  is the best evidence we have of God's existence. (Don't ask where that came from - I can't even  remember  now...)    So, summer is winding down to a close. Not counting today, I have twenty days left until school starts yet again. And, I must admit, I'm sort of looking forward to it. But it's sort of complicated, because I know that I'm not actually looking forward to the whole year. I really hate school, honest to goodness. I'm just anticipating that very first day. It's always fresh, exciting - something new. I like that. I really enjoy the change. But eventually the novelty will wear off, and then school will suck as it usually does. My strategy is to keep the novelty in my mind for as long as possible.     I went to the bookstore on Wednesday. Oh, how I love that place. I would really love to work there in high school. Anyway, I managed to buy five books for just over twenty-five dollars:  A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Dubliners  by James Joyce,  Walden and Civil Disobedience  by Henry David Thoreau,  Gulliver's Travels  by Jonathan Swift,  Crime and Punishment  by Fyodor Dostoevsky (did I possibly get that right?), and  Tales of Mystery and Imagination  by Edgar Allan Poe. Yeah, lots of nice cheap classics at the Barnes and Noble. Great happiness for a nerdy loser-freak like myself. Oh, joy! Anyway, I'm currently reading  Portrait  by Joyce, and it's... very different, very well-written, and somewhat dull, in my humble opinion. But I'm almost done, and according to my dad  Dubliners  is much better.     Oh, god. My brother is down stairs watching  Lizzie McGuire.  Really, call me crazy, but when there's nothing good on TV I tend to just turn the damn thing off.     Oh, he just switched to  Rugrats.  Or maybe  All Grown Up.  I can't tell.    Ah, life...    Well, that's just about all I have to say. So, here's a moderately lengthy and intensely boring entry just specially for you...and you and you and anyone else who wants it. Smiles.

      This is an article from my other blog: Under the Ice at astuteobservation.blogspot.com that I thought was extremely relevant to this page.  Adults have a common problem of classifying young people as one mass, not normal people but sort of semi-human group with relatively consistent opinions and tastes. Think about it and you'll see what I mean. Signs of it are everywhere: Kid's meals, kid's Post, kid's shows. All this because of the mistaken belief that all kids like the same things. This amalgamation of America's youth is a symptom of a bigger problem, which I call the "Sub-Human Child Mentality." This, quite obviously, is the belief that, as a very wise man so cogently put it, "children are in training to be people." People with this mentality (most of the adult population) assume that children have not developed a full enough spectrum of emotions, thoughts and experiences to be treated as relevant members of society. I, as someone who has recently undergone the change from a childlike mind to a more adult one, can testify that this isn't true. As a child, one is more fresh, more alive, more human in many ways than an adult. A young person hasn't had as many bad experiences as an adult, so their minds aren't clogged with fear. This is why children's opinions should be respected. I'm not trying to pretend that young people can decide everything by themselves. It is incredibly important, especially in the early years, that an adult's experience by factored before a decision is made. In an ideal world, experienced adults would explain the guidelines and limitations they understand from a long life, then let children decide within those parameters what they believe. The Sub-Human Child Mentality has grave repercussions in a young person's life, the primary one being inability to express oneself. Because children are not viewed as people with valid opinions, they don't get chances to say what's on their minds when they're young, and grow up not knowing how to communicate. It's satisfying to avenge all the young people who were classified as "below normal intelligence" or "ADD" because their culture disrespected them and not because they were born with a sub-normal cranial capacity. There are two fronts that must be tackled in the destruction of the Sub-Human Child Mentality and it's replacement with a respect for the young. First, there are the adults who must be re-educated to understand the ideas stated above. Second are the children, who will need no more than freedom and encouragement to make their mark on the world.

      What's your favorite part of the newspaper?  For me it's the editorial.  If I could have only one page of the newspaper, I would take the editorial page.  Or maybe the front page.  Let's just say that I'd go for section A.  Frankly, there's a lot of dumb people out there.  Then they write their annoying pro-Bush articles.  Make sure you read today's editorial, Elm.  There's a horrible letter about how Kerry is evil, etc. that really got under my skin.  But there was also a letter of questions to ask yourself about the candidates that was clear-cut, concise, and wonderful.

      On the war in Iraq:  People tell me that the war in Iraq was necessary, that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, and he was going to attack us with WMDs. After I finish laughing, I reply as follows:  "A) Although Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, he was killing fewer Iraqis than we have in our war. Isn't it also more important to focus on the welfare of our own country before we take into our own hands the welfare of another country? After our country is in working order (no multi-billion dollar defecit), then we can focus on other countries, some in far worse condition than Iraq. We can do this in peaceful ways, such as providing basic immunizations (the money spent in Iraq could have paid for basic immunizations for every child in the world for 42 years!).  B) Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction. And don't come back to me in a month or so telling me that I was wrong, because they 'found' WMDs, which they probably will. There have been numerous inside reports of WMDs being flown into the country, not to be dropped, but to be "found"."  Someone needs to teach "President" George W. Bush. I mean that in a literal, non-threatening way. Please don't arrest me I'm just a minor. (Damn Patriot Act)!

      Quite frankly, I do not belong here.  Yes, I am a youth of the nation.  No, I am not informed.  No, my intelligence is not greater than that of many adults.  Yes, I have thoughts and opinions that differ from most.  No, they are not beyond the intelligence of any.  I guess all I've got is an annoying habit of forcing in my two cents worth.  But maybe that's all I need?
