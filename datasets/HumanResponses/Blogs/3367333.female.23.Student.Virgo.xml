      or,  in the room the women come and go/talking of michaelangelo  (t.s. eliot) last night's dinner, though it suffered from an identity crisis, was an ostensible success, though i was quite ill after.  wontons are hard to make, or, actually, it's more like it's hard to make wontons maintain their structural integrity.  pumpkin and yellow split-pea soup was also a success.

      i think spring was skipped, and i fear so was summer. i feel as though i've been eviscerated, inexplicably so, my organs liquified. after a relatively heavy talk last night, i'm feeling lagged.  what began two weeks ago as a very freaky vision/flashback when i was performing transformed to  the mystery of the scarf  and moderately intrusive memories of details without narrative content.  now that same thread became a heavy knowledge.  about my mother.  something i already knew, but every realization that concurs with that knowledge weighs on me heavier.  i feel almost as though i was more wronged by her failure to protect me -- her failure to recognize that i needed protection, her tacit acceptance of what he did as his right -- than i was by my father's direct harms.  in a sense, though, i know it's wrong to believe that; i know that she was likely not in a position to contest his actions, or didn't think she was (how can i presume to speak for her experience?  i'm not sure i believe this but need to say i do).  enough of this.  i'll deal.

      this has been one of the most non-productive weekends in my life.  i was planning to get so much done, yet i've managed almost nothing -- except i finished sorting through records on trauma & typing that bibliography for DMC.  unfortunately, i exceeded my alotted hours for last week, but sometimes i just have to work when i'm motivated or nothing gets done. my social schedule next week is insane; most of it's fun, but there will be a serious lack of quiet time.  in addition to being busy with social stuff every night between tuesday and next sunday, i'm also trying to find an apartment: the sweet deal i though i had fell through when Bo's sister decided not to move. now i'm grumbly & trying to decide if it's really worth the trouble to move.

      i'm about to do something that's either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid...actually, knowing me, it's probably a bit of both.  i'm finally going to send some poetry to journals, rather than just say i should.  it's a bit stress inducing, particularly since i just realized that i've formatted my submissions incorrectly for one of the journals.  i figure i can't back down if i post it publicly.  at least, i can't back down without looking like a wimp.

      the title of this post says it all: it has been an absolutely marvelous day here in the peg -- up to 23 degrees, sunny.  i'd forgotten just how good i can feel in the summer, just how pleasurable it is to feel my bones and muscles in movement --all told i probably walked ten kilometers today or maybe more -- and, the only unfortunate part, just how easily i sunburn.  it was so nice i even cheated on my vegan diet and had gelatti after the  urlLink pf  reading at mcnally's. i've also determined that i absolutely  must  do something outside of school.  i feel subsumed by the institution, as though i'm in a panoptic nightmare whenever i set foot on campus -- as though everything from what i read to what i wear is being surveyed and judged; paradoxically, though, i also feel completely insignificant, as though i don't exist.  so i might join the ndp, although joining a political party goes against most of my principles: it might, however, be interesting to be involved in the upcoming election. and it's countdown to moving day: july 1st i move into this amazing apartment in a much better neighborhood.  the apartment even has a sunroom.

      so i'm back again today.  bored again, you might accurately say.  after sifting through approximately 700 citations on melancholy and trauma, the program failed to send them to my email address, which is causing me a serious pain in the neck.

      so, first the business, if you want to read the last incarnation of me, i suggest you go visit  urlLink the wurm .  this move isn't so much a reinvention as it is a change of space, and a way for me to explore a different space of expression. i've been thinking about privilege recently, how i struggle with it in an academic setting, and how to negociate my position of (relative) privilege with my (often changing) ideological beliefs.  i mean, realistically, my position as a graduate student is one of privilege (except, perhaps, financially): my job is to read and research, mostly on my own time; there is a cultural cache associated with studying literature and theory that does not extend to most other areas of work; graduate studies adds its own intellectual prestige; i do what i love; i have the time and relative luxury of being able to critique what i see as problems in the world, the institution.  it's these last two items that give me the most problems.  i mean, if we must have an elite in this world, i would rather be party to celebrating an intellectual elite than i would the current system where capital buys prestige regardless of character.  so i have the luxury of doing what i love.  except, i don't think i'm happy.  in fact, i'm quite sure i don't know what happy really is.  i was thinking this at three this morning, when i couldn't sleep.  i feel so guilty for every iota of jouissance i take from my studies that my happiness is quashed.  i want, then, to learn to be happy, to accept this privilege without problematizing it too much.  that, however, leads to a kind of uncritical mode of being with which i'm not ethically comfortable, but it seems somehow hypocritical to be too critical of the system that affords me my position, which i do not want to give up.

      *bitchy comment* if i were as inefficient and incompetant as my bank i'd be fired...before i started work.  *end bitchy comment* that about sums it up.  i'm cranky.  i'd be less cranky if i had the forms (for a line of credit that's been  approved  for over two weeks) in front of me so i could sign them.

      i realized that the title to my last post was, well, a little provocative in a way that i did not intend, so for anyone who actually read it, it has changed.  the slipperiness of the outside/inside world-in-general plays across my language as well as my actions.  though the excuse that i need to get my eyes checked is wearing thin when i narrowly miss walking though doors.

      apparently i have formed an inarticulable psychic bond with derrida circa 1993, one of the more tolerable aspects of this former-self-revisiting non-drama.  reading "By Force of Mourning" it was as though i could understand (but not articulate for anything) and the psychic lightning bolt split me and lit my eyes for hours.  funny reading and writing when the letters refuse to form understandable english words and slide off the screan or page, alice falling through the damned rabbit hole after  i'm late, i'm late, i'm late...no time to say goodbye hello  white rabbit.  the room spins and i stand still at removes from everything i wouldn't know you if you came up to me and started talking but hell, no problems there since i rarely run into people unexpectedly.  if it weren't so cold here i'd go dancing in the rain.  we've had so much of it that it seems a shame to not do anything with it.  luckily i can sit and dream while i work and work while i lose myself in the out-of-control nightmare that is me that is fifteen that makes me want to withdraw, hide under the goosedown comforter and never come out again until the bomb has dropped...or not.  seeing the white flash of the end of the world, even imagining it, is too depressing knowing that when it all ends wherever i'm headed it's not to the heaven i imagined as a child.  and here's me, rambling about nothing.  blame  Pandora  (everyone else did).

      i am feeling far too much like i'm fifteen/sixteen again and far too little like myself ever since my last session of bodywork.  how i despise this little thing i call memory, particularly the way one memory has the power to throw me off kilter and out of control.  so i'm sixteen and my world is flying apart across galaxies, but i'm twenty-three and i don't think i've ever been more together.  the drama, unfortunately, is playing out in my body and eating habits, again, always.  the urge to eat uncontrolleably, to be comforted by eating, fighting my current food neurosis.  i hate myself after i've eaten -- anything, not just over-indulging -- but there's a longing to be filled running deeper than my body, the counterweight to the compulsion toward emptiness.  all this merely masks a ridiculous level of flying-apart fear.  so i've retreated to the library for a day of research.  my own, although that, given my highly-fraught thesis topic, is perhaps not a good idea.

      he misses me! i'm not entirely sure why -- he is, afterall, ambivalent at best about the things (carreer, current healing journey, poetry) that profoundly inform who i am -- but he misses me just the same.

      the good news is that i managed to finish my hours last week.  shortly after i posted my computer rant, i managed to log onto the system, so that's all good.  i'm a bit torn about pete still, and that's not so good, but after he called, it might be do-able.  apart from that, i'm well, unentertaining, and tired: i fell into bed last night with my clothes on and rolled out of it this morning and straight off to work.  yuck.  i hate being this unenergetic.

      one of these days i will learn to save my posts before trying to post them.  i just lost a long and entertaining one, which i, unfortunately, don't think i can replicate. i truly hate the u of m's remote access to library resources.  the server that would identify me seems to be down, and now i can't complete my hours for this week because i need access to a multitude of electronic databases and the webpage that identifies me is unavailable.  how terribly inconvenient. pete's visit is going reasonably well.  i was a little stressed out earlier this week because i felt as though i constantly had to be defending winnipeg and my affinity with this place to him -- particularly in the face of his disparaging remarks about it.  that tension has eased up slightly.  i think, however, that i'm in trouble: i think i'm falling in love with the boy.  the trouble comes in two ways.  first, he has trouble with the "hard stuff": in other words, i can't count on him to be supportive of the therapy i have to do; i can't count on him to even understand why i need it.  he's better than he used to be about it.  now he just ignores my past and its effect on me rather than repeatedly telling me to stop living in the past.  that's still not enough, though.  his attitude means it's harder for me to engage in my healing work when he's around, harder even to think about it.  second, related, but more about me than him.  even having him around this week makes me realize that my desire for him is entangled is a script of deepest terror, and i absolutely cannot, will not, refuse to live imprisoned in that knot.  it feels in some ways as though i've cut myself off at the neck (figuratively) to avoid feeling it in any deep way, and that's getting harder and harder.

      i just heard the results of the griffin poetry prize & i must say that i'm absolutely apalled.  how the judges could have chosen  Loop  over  Now You Care , i'm not sure &, frankly, any such speculation on my part would result in accusations of substance over-use on their part.  now i will freely admit to being highly biased with regard to Di's writing -- i've been affected by all her books, and  Now You Care  was no exception; however, as objectively as possible, Anne Simpson's book is simply not a great one, & i find her writing postured and forced -- self-consciously styled "very good poetry" (a friend put it best when she suggested that it's the kind of poetry where you can envision the author patting herself on the back after every line); Di's book, however, is great, brilliant in the breadth and depth of its scope.  i'm not sure if my response to  Loop  is informed by my desire for different results, although i thought it was okay but not great before the shortlist came out. enough.  railing about the results won't change them. on a much happier note, pete arrived last night, & his visit is, thus far, going well.  i'm so glad to see him, & to discover that he is truly dear to me here & now (as opposed to simply in my mind).

      so i worry about nothing.  i just want everything to go well for pete's visit.  (and i want to avoid the visit to the giant mosquito statue in komarno -- i'm so sick of the winterpeg and big bug jokes.)  i'm also missing ontario quite badly just now, although i'm really not sure why.  perhaps something to do with pete's visit... also beginning to have some more body memories.  i hate them, particularly this feeling of suffocation that doesn't seem tied to any external stimulus.  and i'm tired of the facile assumption that this is the result of having felt suffocated in the past.  why is it that, because of my history of trauma, people assume a one to one correlation between what my body experiences now and what it experienced in the past?  is that really the way it works? anyway, off to go grocery shopping and clean my apartment before he gets here.  because of my chronic absence from home (the whole conference thing) the fur balls are being fruitful and multiplying.  so are the dust rabbits.

      this is the week the academics descended on winnipeg like the rain this week.  the university of manitoba hosted the annual congress of learned societies conference...actually, hosting would be the more correct term; it's still going on.  i, however, am officially conferenced out.  from saturday through tuesday, i saw between nine and twelve papers daily -- some really cool ones, but still mentally exhausting. pete gets in tomorrow night, and, although i'm looking forward to his visit, i'm super nervous.  i don't know why.  maybe because i feel as though i've put on a bunch of weight, maybe because i'm not sure he'll like my (mostly academic) friends, maybe because i'm not sure we actually have anything in common, maybe because i'm really tired.  all of the above.

       interlocutor  i'm tired of this story. this same old story with roles recast.&nbsp; "many recovered memory narratives resemble the heroic narratives of men, while introducing different protagonists, plot structures, and denouments.&nbsp; in the sexual abuse recovery movement, the subtext is mourning a lost male protector [. . . .] and a felt absence of adequate restorative possibilities" (Janice Haaken,  Pillar of Salt , 56).&nbsp; why is a male protector necessary in the first place?&nbsp; not only for me, not only for other survivors of abuse, for anyone?&nbsp; the very necessity casts us in the role of the victim, before we are even victimized. and the 'feminist' heroic narrative?&nbsp; so, instead of a hero there's a heroine.&nbsp; does that change the way story functions -- it's propagandistic social role?&nbsp; if the heroine behaves in the traditional way, she is acted upon; if she refuses that role, she replicates the traditional heroic narrative, acting upon others and upon the world, colonizing the other and the world. i don't want to write that story.  (but what other?)  how, i wonder, is it possible to write story otherwise. and, dr. h., what does it mean to replicate a narrative form -- the heroic narrative you cite -- while introducing new protagonists, plot structures, and denouments?&nbsp; does that not constitute a new story?&nbsp; and is such a thing possible?&nbsp; is it possible, for example, to write a heroic narrative and have the heroine be less heroic?&nbsp; is it possible to write a human as heroine without eclipsing her humanity, without romanticizing her?&nbsp; would the narrative remain recognizable? do i want to read a recognizable narrative?&nbsp; isn't my distaste for the&nbsp;recognizable the reason i gravitate toward highly experimental texts? do i want to write a recognizable narrative?&nbsp;  the correct answer is, only if you want people to read it ms. em.

      i think i've got a case of resume envy...or at least a tad bit of shame about the lack of ...er... padding on mine.&nbsp; after a twilight-zone case of mistaken identity when i received an email from an editor addressed to professor mel (who, as of right now, does not exist), i've been trying to figure out a way to prevent similar misidentifications.&nbsp; my solution for right now is to append an optional signature to my email stating "ms. mel, graduate student, department of english, university of manitoba."&nbsp; some friends believe that this is misleading: since the u of m has both an m.a. and a phd programme, it's possible that editors and conference co-ordinators might think i'm a phd student.&nbsp; so, they, whom i respect tremendously, believe i should specify that i'm a master's student, and i have no desire to do so, although i wouldn't lie if i were asked outright.&nbsp; to advertize that i don't hold a graduate degree, first, announces that i'm less qualified, at least on paper, than most people proposing papers (especially in&nbsp;a case like this essay collection).&nbsp; it also would cause me to doubt the merit of my work: i don't want to have to wonder if my work was accepted because it was good  for a master's candidate  (or, conversely, turned down because i'm  just a master's candidate ).&nbsp; i want my work to compete, not my resume...and yes, i think i would feel the same way if i had a doctorate.

      last night was a mess from the start.&nbsp; i had these complementary&nbsp;tickets to a fashion show at a really nice club in the exchange district and had arranged to go with a friend.&nbsp; she bailed.&nbsp; i went alone.&nbsp; i usually wouldn't have minded, but i didn't know a single person in the room, and i do not mix well with the young, the beautiful, the rich, and the metro (i actually saw a straight man drink a cosmopolitan...).&nbsp; and the conversations taking place among these aspiring fashionistas were, well, vapid.&nbsp; i was horrified to hear someone talking about buying a $1000 dollar handbag.&nbsp; it's a purse for godssake!&nbsp; and as the perfect end to a perfect evening (my voice is  so  dripping with sarcasm), when i went to pay my tap (1 martini), the bartender gave me a tab for 150$...so not mine.&nbsp; i looked at the name at the bottom, and it wasn't mine.&nbsp; i pointed this out, showed the guy some i.d., and found out that (drumroll please) the idiot had given my credit card to someone else.&nbsp; i was just a little bit furious, although i'm sure it was a misunderstanding and whatever drunk person has my credit card will realize it in the morning...or afternoon, whenever they wake up...but i still cancelled it as soon as i got home. i'll write again when i'm feeling&nbsp;a bit less irritated and outraged.

      i just found out that i'm too old by just less than&nbsp;a month to apply for a rhodes scholarship.&nbsp; okay, not that i'm sure i'd have any chance -- affinity for and success in outdoor sports (as opposed to activities) is one of the criteria on which selection is based, afterall; and, frankly, i'm not sure i'm one of the eleven smartest people in canada.&nbsp; (actually, i'm quite sure i'm not, but it's the people who apply who matter).&nbsp; anyway, i just think it sucks that i can't even try.&nbsp; okay, so that's just me being stupid.&nbsp; on the upside, i saw three fab shows at the fringe today: pith is absolutely amazing in all respects -- well written, well performed, funny (at times even painfully funny), and touching -- and certainly my favorite show thus far; i also saw three ring circus, which was both funny and intelligent -- a rare combination given the subject matter (the israeli-palistinian situation from the pov of a young jew); finally, i saw jem rolls,&nbsp;a really amazing performance poet from britain. i've been on a bit of a spending spree lately, spending money i can't really afford to, actually.&nbsp; i'm doing this partly because i just gave away two-thirds of my wardrobe (the two-thirds that hasn't fit since very shortly after i moved here) and i'm not sure why i'm doing the rest of it...i&nbsp;am, however, starting to feel guilty, and i haven't even paid for my bus ticket back to t.o. yet.&nbsp; actually, i know why i'm doing some of it: i'm sick and tired of being a broke student, and i feel like i'm working way&nbsp;harder than many people, and i'm really tired of depriving myself when i see others indulging.&nbsp; i really need to grow up and pull myself together, no?

      fringe rocks!  i saw a show called Liminal yesterday -- the one i wanted to see was sold out -- and the way the actors used movement was fab.  i thought i'd go see another show tonight, but i pre-bought a ticket for tomorrow night's show because i have some serious work to catch up on.  incidentally, tomorrow is going to be my busiest day fringing: four shows (about 40$ for a day of theater...how cool is that?  most of the time that's what one show costs). my workout really inspired me on an intellectual level today.  i just love it when that happens!  i was working my abs on the decline board and suddenly i knew what the introduction and conclusion to my thesis were going to be!  in my introduction i'm going to look at the liminality of the survivor figure and her experience in critical and popular discourse; then i'm going to discuss each of my texts (duh!); and then i'm going to speak about the socio-political function of trauma narratives.  have i mentioned that i just love it when inspiration strikes!  (okay, i know; i really need to flesh out what i just outlined, because as it stands it sounds like i'm pasting together stuff from a dozen books...i'll figure that out.  the good news is, none of the criticism echoes my thoughts, so i might be okay.) i also made some fabulous finds at a book store that's going out of business...among them are Kristeva's Revolution in Poetic Language, Edward Said's Beginnings, a biography of Anne Sexton, and Miriam Toews' Swing Low: A Life (which, by the way, is one of the most interesting takes on auto/biography i've ever read, and a truly touching book besides...aren't i just a little aliterative today?) and some great time wasters (i'm on a harry potter kick since the third movie, which i've seen three times, came out):  urlLink muggle net  is a great unofficial fan site, and  urlLink j.k. rowling 's official site is also fun, and amazingly designed.  i'd love to learn how to do things like that with a computer.

      the Winnipeg International Fringe Festival is going on, so i've been seeing some plays -- i missed the one some of my friends went to on saturday night because i was really sick...i feel rather sorry for the cab driver who took me home; i think i had some kind of twenty-four hour thing. anyway, better now.  yesterday i saw the Lesbian Rangers with jude and went to see Sound and Fury's fakespearian drama,  Testicles and ye Sacks of Rome .  both were funny, but, especially in the second play, the humour lacked subtlety.  i'm going back tonight to take in one more serious play ( Jill's War ) and another comedy. i've also been on a largely fruitless search for information on butcher shop culture in early seventeenth-century Amsterdam.  partly, i'm just not sure where to look, and today, it's just too damned hot.  (and if i say it's too hot...)  so i'm off to do some work and then meeting j.

      the title today just about says it all.  if i can't take the edge off a feeling by telling myself, by knowing, that it is today 15 July 2004, why should i assume, as one of my therapists insisted, that the feeling is about the past?  please accept that today i feel unsafe -- unable to protect myself and, for some reason, quite sure i need to be able to.  that this took place in a session of body work didn't help: in my opinion, there are few more vulnerable positions than laying on my back.  anyway, enough of that: i'm irritable and uncomfortable and, honestly, pretty gross feeling.

      the e.d. thing seems to be acting up, so i'm trying a new solution.  i've started a  urlLink food diary  as kind of a spin on the written diaries nutritionists and personal trainers ask you to keep.  hopefully this will keep the problem manageable...and help me get down to a size three again. i've also decided that i'm moving, although i'm not leaving this building.  the suite above mine is becoming vacant at the end of this month, and my super offered it to me, at the same price.  it has two huge advantages over this place: first, it's new-to-me space; second, there will be no loud people above me because it's on the top floor.  with any luck, this will make working at home a whole lot easier. i'm also kind of freaked because i have an article proposal due tomorrow, and, although it's drafted, i'm totally not confident in my ability to write a proposal, and this one needs to be edited very badly.  i'm nervous because i very badly want an in-print academic publication -- preferrably two or three -- before i finish my master's.  i want there to be absolutely no chance that my top schools don't offer me money -- and even less chance that they don't accept me.  my thesis research is not going well at all, and, even though i have another year to finish, i'm starting to worry about not finishing on time.  actually, the research i'm doing for others isn't going particularly well either.  but that's my own fault. i'm so irritable.  irritated.  so hard to keep from wanting to break heads for no reason.  and, frankly, i don't even have the words to name the images that flash through my mind recently.  at least they haven't come today, so i've been mostly productive and mostly okay.  at least this irritation is making my workouts go reasonably well.

      apparently i'm defective.  or more likely, the u of m mail server is overloaded or some such problem, because the email i tried to post to my blog, well, didn't post.  clearly, because i am now writing about the failure of the experiment. i'm trying to determine whether i should really call it a day, go for a walk, rent some movies, chill with jackie, then watch the movies i (will) rent, or if i should persist in being a good little wurm and try to do some more work on my thesis, which is progressing dismally.  and yeah, blogging my life is not going to help me make that choice, i know.  but right now it's keeping me from thinking too hard.  ciao.

      i'm trying to post by email today to see if this feature actually works.  also  because i'm bored and need to just mess around.  i should be doing things like  cleaning my apartment and laundry and going to the gym... last night i went with my friend jon to see a beatles cover band at, quite  possibly, one of my least favorite pubs.  my conclusions were that the band was  okay; the beatles invoke a sense of nostalgia in me; the gin upstairs is better  than the stuff they serve downstairs; gin does really nasty things to me --  like impair my judgement more than most alcohol and give me wicked hangovers  and make me way more lethargic than i usually am.  and i get this after only  two drinks.    ------------------------------------------------- This mail sent through IMP: http://horde.org/imp/

      twice in one day! i decided that it's high time to start seriously considering where i'm going to send my phd applications and start requesting information and application packages from those schools.  i remember all too well the chaotic hell that accompanied the process of applying for my ma.  trust me, i don't want to repeat it.  besides application deadlines seem to be getting earlier and earlier each year.  i'm also kind of worried that the same thing that happened in my ma applications will happen again: that i will neither have a choice where i go nor will i receive funding.  i realize it's kind of a silly fear, but i was told throughout my undergraduate year that (1) any school would be lucky to have me; (2) i should have no problem getting scholarship money.  neither of those predictions came true, and, although i'm happy at my current home -- or, at least, i think i'm in the right place, at least for now -- it was a blow (to both my confidence and to my debt load -- already too high) to receive only one offer of admission and no offers of funding.  besides, the words of a friend of mine keep echoing in my mind: that i've gotten my grades because i've given professors what they want to hear.  i'm not sure that's the case; at least i haven't tried to give profs what they want to hear, but the perception that that is a possibility worries me: if one of my closest friends here thinks so, who else does, and what are the people i'm not so close to saying about me behind my back. oh, screw this.  enough paranoid ranting for one day.

      instead of something i'm doing because i have to lose weight and because i'm paying $35 a month, going to the gym this morning was actually a pleasure.  i woke up looking forward to my jaunt, although my workout was mediocre (resulting from my absolute lack of desire to spend more than ten minutes on the treadmill -- on days where i use weights, i usually do between fifteen and twenty to warm up), but otherwise, i'm feeling energized. at least one of my research contracts has been renewed for the fall, so that's good news: this loosely translates to not having to whore myself out as the marking bitch nearly so much (or hopefully at all...keep all fingers crossed, please).  it's also with a professor whom i really admire, which makes me look forward to it all the more. i'm also looking forward to some vacation time.  i shouldn't feel burned out in the summer, but it's starting to get to that point: i'm reading between 12 and 15 hours a day, and i'm horribly stressed out that the writing is going poorly -- or, more accurately, not at all.  i realize that there are two kinds of writers: those who (can) write daily and those who are incapable of writing six months of the year; i'm also aware that i am one of the latter, and usually that doesn't stress me out too much because usually that block applies more to creative writing than to academic writing (the blocks in my academic writing are far more nerve wracking and less organic to my process), but this particular block extends to my thesis/proposals/in-process articles as well, and i'm starting to freak out.  i still think, however, that i can get two chapters written by the end of the summer.  at least, i hope that's the case.

      she who has been remiss in updating her blog sincerely apologizes.  she also wishes to warn the all of two readers that this will not be the last time there's a gap in her entries. now, here's an update. -i do not have the first draft of chapter one written. -i have joined a gym -- how unthinkable. -i've discovered a cool feature on windows media player that allows me to copy music to my hard drive. -i have a wack load of work to do. -i have just (accidentally) changed my hair colour to a more brilliant auburn.  what i was actually trying to do was begin a transition back to my natural hair colour.  i have a hair appointment this afternoon for a badly needed cut and, perhaps, a tone down on the colour -- at least so it doesn't look like it came straight out of a bottle, which, of course, it did, but only you, my faithful readers need note that -- particularly since none of you are here to see it. -i'm feeling desperately homesick.  i'm also finding it impossible to stop doing eight things at once, mostly because every time i stop for longer than a minute, i become paralyzed.  so i'm either uber-active or catatonic. since i'm at a computer in the library, and i'm not technically supposed to be writing in my blog in this space at this time, i'm going to sign off and promise to return sooner rather than later. by the way,  Neuromancer  is an awesome book.

       i must have stepped into a time warp and stepped out in late-october or early-november.  in fact, the weather is so convincing that, but for the foliage remain on the trees, it could well be either of those months, although i think i saw some yellowed leaves strewn across one of the sidewalks near the library at school.  nah...that must have been a hallucination.  really. i have also made an unfortunate discovery: the miracle drug.  it makes me feel like the energizer bunny on a combination of speed and prozak, like i could take on the world, or at least run for an hour.  this feeling is quite intoxicating, and i'm trying to take as little of it as possible in order to avoid getting addicted.  it seems, if there was an ideal drug for me to be addicted to, it would be speed, and ephedra with a coffee chaser has a similar effect: my mind remains sharper for longer periods of time, i have more energy, and, as i noted before, i feel rather invincible.  so it's an unfortunate discovery, because it takes a chemical compound to make me feel like that. and, in fact, today, i'm feeling quite down, much the same as i've been since friday when, after being up all night sick, i hardly stumbled my way through a workout.

      i just had a consultation with a new hair stylist...the last one i tried did a good job, but, well, bangs make me feel like i'm in elementary school again.  besides, this one goes to the same gym as i do, and he seems really nice.  it wierds me out a bit though that he talks about his "vision" for my hair...um...i'm a little uncomfortable trusting my look to an artist.  really.  i'm pretty low-maintenance, so anything too wild is, well, too wild.  i am, however, thinking of getting one of those really loose perms to give my hair a little bit of texture.  i'm tired of the "i could have done the sixties without a flat iron" look. anyway, i'm also having an absolutely horrible day.  i was up all night last night being sick, and i really don't feel much better today.  sick absolutely blows. the guy beside me in the internet cafe is flipping through pornographic images.  this annoys me; it is, afterall, a public place. because i'm sick, i had a really terrible workout.  and now i'm very very very very lethargic, and i'm supposed to be working on the first chapter of my thesis.  that is, at the moment, not happening.  clearly.  i mean, i'm writing this post.  (past the last post...posting twice in one day).  but beyond that, i'm simply unmotivated.  yesterday, i was like the energizer bunny; i could have moved the world, and certainly accomplished a lot.  today, i resisted taking the little miracle energy pill because i was already nauseous.

      i've done a stupid and started yet another book, although this one is not thesis related, thankfully; if it was, wc, my advisor, would have every reason to kick my tail end: he has repeatedly stated that i know enough about my topic to start writing (but no amount of hearing that is going to convince me...stubborn little brat that i am).  anyway, i'm only about 70 pages in, but  Missing Sarah  is quickly making its way onto my list of must-read books...it was haunting and sorrowful and generous from the first word.  for those of you who don't know anything about the background of this book: Maggie de Vries writes to remember her sister, who was killed and whose DNA was found on Robert Picton's farm.

      i'm quite fired up right now.  my mind's racing, filled with ideas, but unable to settle on any one thing.  i'm currently working in three word processor windows -- my thesis, some notes on one of the books for my memoir course next term, and a paper proposal for a conference -- plus this one.  my brain feels like it's going to explode.

      A set of questions created by Marcel Proust designed to reveal one's inner nature--questions of the romantic sort with the pretension of being scientific:   What do you see as complete satisfaction?  achieving my goals -- a phd, a career, a medium-sized office lined with books -- and furnishing the rest of my life with good friends, good books, my cat, and a condo with a gorgeous view wouldn't hurt.  Where were you and at what moment in your life were you the happiest?  on my couch, reading any number of books at once...i'm generally easy to please, but i tend to be at my happiest when i'm also at my most stressed out.  What is the your principal character trait?  ambition  And which trait are you the least proud of?  ambition -- when it starts to overwhelm the other parts of me and subsume my desire to empathize with others and when it starts driving my thought process  The quality that you prefer in a man?  compassion, intelligence, sense of humour  And in a woman?  same as above...why have a double standard.  Your greatest fear?  flying: for a week before i'm scheduled to fly anywhere, i have this horrible recurring nightmare in which the world explodes while i'm in the plane.  What is your most valuable possession?  books.  In what have you succeeded the most in your life?  i don't know yet...i guess in school, but i hope there will be other kinds of successes.  Your favorite painters?  Picasso, Frida Khalo, Caravaggio.  Your favorite composers?  Rachmaninov  The words that you like?  re-storying (see Betsy Warland's  The Bat had Blue Eyes ), swirl, labial, reconsider, illocution, perlocution  Your favorite cult work?  i'm not really sure: i love  Bladerunner , but i'm not sure that counts as a cult work anymore.  Your favorite authors?  Di Brandt, Miriam Toews, Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida (yes, i am a sucker for punishment), Daphne Marlatt, Betsy Warland, Susan Holbrook, Margaret Laurence, John Donne.  The book you keep by your bedside?  there's never only one...right now, mostly thesis stuff and a couple of novels -- no major spiritual tomes or anything.  The song that you often whistle?  i do not whistle, although if no one's listening, you might hear me sing (badly) along to whatever happens to be playing.  Your favorite color?  blue, beige, black.  Your favorite drink?  soy mocha with an extra shot of espresso and a shot of raspberry -- only for a treat  Your drug?  caffeine, speed if i could get my hands on it  Your heroes in life?  gandhi...there are others, but this is a hard question.  If you could change one thing about your physical appearance?  i'd be thinner.  and if i could change two, i'd make my hair not flat (i could have done the sixties without a flat iron).  The faults that you take the greatest pleasure in?  sarcasm, escapism  Your greatest regret?  my family  What do you hate above all?  excess noise  How would you like to die?  quickly and as painlessly as possible  Your current state of mind?  serious...but pretty good  Your motto?  be the change you want to see in the world (adapted from something gandhi said)
