      Stupid People  Stupid people annoy me. Sometimes I need to repeat myself ten times before the point gets across. And the worst part is, the stupid one finally gets the point but a few days later, he/she'll ask you to explain it again. All stupid people should be shipped off to a small island in the middle east and be stupid together.  I also dislike fussy people. Does it really matter which side of the food court we sit in to eat? Does it? Hm? Hm? Hm? I also hate slow people (those below the age of 50, otherwise you're entitled to be slow). Why does it take you more than half an hour to eat a bowl of noodles? Why do you have to keep pausing and talking while eating? Hm? Hm? Hm?  I am just so full of hatred today. It's such a natural high.

      Lazy Sunday, Lazy Me  Today must be the laziest Sunday I've ever had. My ass has been stuck to the bed the whole day. I couldn't make myself get up to go blading. Even the thought of having nice firm muscular sexy legs did not appeal to me on this hot Sunday. I relished being in my air con cooled room and being with my comfy pillows and bed. Ahh. I love Sundays. God rested on Sunday and I believe, so should we.  I have been reading a couple of blogs belonging to lesbians lately. It's truly amazing how a relationship involving two girls goes much more smoothly than that with a girl and a guy. I've added a new lesbian blog in my links section. Go read to believe. I think the root of all heterosexual relationship problems is the involvement of a guy.  Finally fixed my archives. I don't know how on earth I got to be so clever.

      1:11PM  I just realised I have no archives. Shit, I hate messing with the template code cos everything gets messed up. Dammit.  I need food. I'm so hungry.   What's playing on Winamp now? F4  9:32PM  It's a Friday night and I am home. Survivor's on in half an hour! Anyway, I'm pondering whether or not to go clubbing with a girlfriend and a bunch of soon to be pilots tonight. I have not clubbed in ages, well two weeks that is, but clubbing with a bunch of guys who recently reached puberty (exaggeration. I love to exaggerate) is not really my idea of fun. So i guess it's me and the TV tonight. Yipee.   Tomorrow, I'll be going to the travel fair and hopefully I'll manage to buy my airtickets to Oz really cheap and I also need to book my trip to Bintan for the week after next. I feel so grown up, going on trips on my own. I really do. I feel like i am conquering the world.  A friend's friend - a girl mind you, kinda got beaten up for asking a first class ah beng to shush in the cinema. My sis and i have a policy. If the rude chatterbox is a nerdy looking guy or some bimbo, it's ok to shush the person. But if it's some asshole speaking in hokkien with his words punctuated with kaneenah or chao ci bai, then it's best to bite our tongues.   Oh, why did i move my blog? Well, I have a psychopathic fan who stalks me. Besides i like hopping from blog to blog. I get a new cool name like finicky feline and i got this pretty pink blog skin. Aren't those good enough reasons to move? I like pink.

      Malaysians. Sigh.  I haven't written here in ages. Went to KL for 4 days this week for some stupid exhibition. I just sat there for 9 hours a day trying to wile my time away by scribbling in my notepad and checking out the cute guys, or lack thereof. I thought Singaporeans were kiasu, but it seems Malaysians are as well. I'm not being racist, but the Malays were the worst. I had free pens on the table, and some of them took not only one pen, but had the nerve to swipe all the pens from the table, well mostly with a sheepish grin. I felt embarassed for these people, who were totally unashamed of their greed. It was disgusting. The toilets at the stadium were equally disgusting. When the cubicles were occupied, i saw people go in the shower cubicles and pee on the floor there. These are my fellow countrymen and it embarasses me.   I'm tired as hell. Gonna get some shut eye now. Good night!   Mood: Tired and grumpy Music: Gigi Leung

      Balls & Chain  I got so drunk last night till I was sick to the stomach. I hate what alcohol does to me. Oh, in my drunken stupor, I lost my singledom. Or so i think. Yes, i most definitely think i'm not single anymore. Sigh. Alcohol.    Mood: Hung over Music: Hilary Duff

       2:30PM    After not blogging for so long, i seem to have lost my touch. I have nothing to say. Oh, except that i'm hungry. Starved.     Revenge is the sweetest taste in the world. It makes me have butterflies in my tummy and gets my adrenaline pumping. :) So it's true when they say you shouldn't bear a grudge. Just unleash your powers of revenge and be done with it once and for all.     See, this is what happens to people when they get less than 8 hours of sleep in 48 hours. They blabber nonsensically.

       9:41AM    Had an ok weekend. Nothing special. On Saturday, helped BF wash his fish tank. Can you believe the water was so dirty and green you could not see the poor luohan at all? Visibility was zero. Washed the front porch as well, and gave the dog a bath. Dammit, I don't recall signing for housekeeping and chores when I entered the relationship.     Saturday night, we went clubbing, and BF's friends' crazy girlfriends dragged me up on the bartop to dance. I was mortified, as they wouldn't take no for an answer and about five people physically dragged me up on the bartop. It didn't help that I wasn't even dressed appropriately for clubbing and the girls beside me had their midriffs bared and looked oh so sexy. Aish. Plus, I wasn't even drunk.

       1:34PM    Got into an argument with BF yesterday, but it ended all good. Good meaning I got my way as usual and I listened amusedly (with a stony face of course) to 20 minutes of grovelling. Then, being the gracious feline that i am, i forgave him. Hiaks. Who's your mummy?!!!    It's absolutely crazy that Fantasia, Latoya and Jennifer were in the bottom three of AI3 yesterday. I was bloody shocked. How the hell has John Stevens stayed in the competition so long?! Americans really have no clue what talent means. Just look at their adoration of William Hung. Ptooi. Oh, Singapore Idol auditions begin in June. That'll be a hoot.  A friend of mine is in need of a fuck buddy. If any of you girls are looking for a cute (U+A), well spoken and very well endowed (in certain areas) guy, do let me know. Quoting him, he wants someone who will "....fuck me mentally, verbally, emotionally and physically."   Mood: Chilled out Music: Nothing

       1:14PM    My colleague pisses me off. She is the slowest eater i've ever seen. Have you ever seen anyone cut a fishball into 8 pieces and eat them one at a time? So, as usual, she was being her slow self today and since i had long finished my lunch, I bought The New Paper and was happily reading how Ranieri's men floundered on the pitch (a bit off topic here i know) when she got grumpy. A while back, she had told me how rude i was reading the newspapers and ignoring her. But, my dear tortoise, what the fuck do you expect me to do while you take forever to finish a bowl of noodles?! Phew, i feel better now.    OH, one more thing. Before we went down for lunch, she made a phone call and i  told her i'd wait downstairs for her while having a smoke. She took nearly half and hour to get her fat ass downstairs, then decided she had to go to the toilet (which took another 10 minutes). Then, she had the nerve to ask me to buy her lunch, since i was already in the queue. KNN lah. NOW i feel much better.  Ladeedaa. It's American Idol night again tonight. I'll be holed up in my room as usual.   Mood: Seethingly pissed off Music: Maroon 5 - This Love

       10:31AM    I'm sitting restlessly at my desk, trying to keep myself busy. My boss is on leave for yet another day, and doesn't seem to want to pick up my call. I can't progress without clearing a few things with him first. This leaves me with absolutely nothing to do, which is all good, but sitting at my desk for 8 hours doing nothing isn't exactly my idea of fun. He's prolly busy shagging his wife whilst i'm sitting here rotting.    What you don't know won't hurt you right? Abso-fucking-lutely. Yet, i know too much. I'm a clever bitch. I know things about you that you don't think I know. Goddamnit. And i DIDN'T need to know them. Now, I don't know what to think. Does all this make sense? I'm trying to say something without being too obvious, but i think i'm sounding like i'm suffering from dementia. Bah.  Mood: Bored Music: The squeak'g of the printer

       2:24PM    Since eons ago, i've found myself very critical of the Christians with their holier-than-thou attitudes. I hate it when they pester you to go to church, in their minds thinking that well be going straight down to hell when we die because we don't believe in what they do. And why did God have to sacrifice his son to wash away everyone's sins? This would inevitably lead to Christians thinking that they can get away with anything, because at the end of the day, the Almighty is forgiving and he will forgive you for all your sins and be able to pluck your harp blissfully in heaven when you die. Do not get me wrong. I have nothing against the religion, just the hypocrites who misinterpret the religion and give it a whole new meaning.    One thing i learned from life is that you always have to be careful with what you say. Never say you're never going to get married cos you'll end up the first to walk down the aisle. I've always said that i'll only date someone who's a free thinker or someone who is less than moderately religious. But hey, life is fucking ironic. It doesn't take a genius to figure out where this entry is heading towards. Yup, you should now know what my boyfriend's religion is.

       3:41PM    Becks finally confessed he had an affair? Somehow, despite his inability to keep his dick in his pants, nobody seems to be blaming him for his wrongdoings. Instead, the blame falls on poor Posh, Loos and whoever dared tarnish the blonde god's reputation. Isn't the world unfair? Not only did he betray his wife and his marriage, everyone seems to be heaping sympathy for the devil. Time and again, my point has been proven. No man, no matter how devoted he seems to his wife and kids, is able to resist temptation. And that pisses me off to no end.

       I DELETED ANOTHER POST AGAIN! Why can't blogger idiot-proof the format. KNN.  My current favourite song:  Hello there, the angel from my nightmare  The shadow in the background of the morgue  The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley  We can live like Jack and Sally if we want  Where you can always find me  We'll have Halloween on Christmas  And in the night we'll wish this never ends  We'll wish this never ends (miss you miss you, miss you miss you)   Where are you and I'm so sorry  I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight  I need somebody and always  This sick strange darkness  Comes creeping on so haunting every time  And as I stared I counted  Webs from all the spiders  Catching things and eating their insides  Like indecision to call you  and hear your voice of treason  Will you come home and stop this pain tonight  Stop this pain tonight   Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)   Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)   Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)  (miss you miss you, miss you miss you, miss you miss you)   Blink 182 - I Miss You

      First Fight  Much to my delight, i had my first fight as a couple yesterday. I pouted, i sulked, i rolled my eyes, i gritted my teeth, i clenched my fists and it felt damn good. Now that the anticipation of the first fight is over, i breathed a sigh of relief. As usual, it was over something minor and i sorta blew my top for awhile. But hey, it's that time of the month, and i AM entitled to blow my top. Blame it on the hormones man. It ain't easy being a girl sometimes.   I love Saturdays cos you know it's still the weekend tomorrow. It's a downer waking up on Sundays  and knowing you have a full five days of work ahead of you.   My silly dog thought he was a cow and chewed a whole load of grass when i brought him down for a walk. I wasn't surprised when he started heaving and a lump of grass plopped out of his mouth onto the ground. The poor soul. It must be hard being a cow trapped in a dog's body.

      I miss Oz.  My trip to Oz was fantastic. I met up with old friends, made some new ones, partied, shopped, stuffed myself with food and came home 3 kg heavier. It was worth it though. I love melbourne. I love the little alleys in town with the quaintest cafes. I love lygon street where italian men actually woo you to come eat in their cafes. I love the fact that a $2 coin gives you 40 seconds to see a fat naked bitch wanking with a dildo.   Can you begin to love someone in a short span of time? i thought it was possible, now i'm not so sure. I guess mostly it's the idea of being in love that puts us in the illusion that we're in love.   Being one half of a couple isn't fun. I hate the fact that you have a responsibility towards that person. I hate the predictibility of a relationship. You know who you're gonna have dinner with tomorrow, the day after that and on the weekend. I hate the fact that I get pissed off sometimes, yet i'm unable to throw a tantrum because i realise i'm 23 yrs old and those days are over. Yet, when you're down and moody, you know there's someone you can turn to, someone who will give you a cuddle and make you smile.

       4:30PM     Ho ho, i made my company lose $5000 today. Made a very honest mistake (i blame my boss for not teaching me properly) and he was cool about. Said "shit happens, don't worry about it". I responded by asking him very anxiously if he was gonna take it out from my salary (i knew he wouldn't but wanted to make him think i felt regretful) and he laughed and said no.  I found out a few things about someone close to me which i didn't like. I'm not supposed to breathe a word about it so i can't confront that person. The info that I got totally took away all the respect i had for this person. No doubt about it that a person should now be judged on his past, but sometimes you can't help it. What the hell should i do?   Life SUCKS.  Oh, i wish Fantasia didn't win AI3. She screeches like a parrot too many a time. Although she's undoubtedly the best performer of the lot, i would have liked an element of unpredictability injected into the show through the underdog winning.

And seriously, what's wrong with luo hans? I had a beloved luohan 2 years ago. 2 actually. 1 i named LY (after myself) and the second one i smuggled in from desaru called momo. LY laid shitloads of eggs and got pissed off cos i kept disturbing her. She died soon after, all her strength sapped from trying to protect her babies. Rest in peace LY. Needless to say, I lost custody of Momo (together with half my closet) when my ex and i broke up.   Mood: Sian Music: Boyz II Men - On Bended Knee

       1:17PM     I've been feeling somewhat maternal lately, and the last time i felt this way, i got myself a doggie. I think it's time for me to get another dog. I fell in love with a cute little fella at the Pasir Ris farm last weekend. He was a JRT cross and kept standing on his two legs, jumping up and down for me to carry him. I wonder if he's still available.   It's sad really. All of ya should drop by that farm and see the hundreds of abandoned dogs there. Please don't aggravate the situation by buying yourself a dog. There are so many needy ones who need your love.  I'm still puzzled. Have you seen "Lost in Translation"? i have no idea what the movie is about. Can anyone please enlighten me?  What is it about guys and farting? The proud look on their face after they let a loud smelly one rip is almost equivalent to that when they win the Champion's League or something. Really disgusting.

       10:49AM     I was merrily on my way to work this morning when my colleague msged me: "I need to go buy stationery for office later, and since the shops only open at 10, i'll be in the office at 11 or so. Is that ok with you?" No that's not fucking ok. I find it such an injustice that I've to be early to the office everyday because I live closer to the office and that you're fat and pregnant and  waddle  walk at a speed of 0.005km/hr and hence it's ok for you to be late.   well, of course i didn't say that out loud. What do you do when your colleague pisses the hell out of you? oh and did i mention that her complacency fetches her a cool $600/mth more than me? And she's jealous of me cos my boss just gave me a measly $200 raise. aaaahhhhhhhhh!!   Last Saturday, i went to centro. In celebration of their 3rd anniversary, entry was free and so were the drinks. i downed a beer and at midnight i was close to crawling on the floor. That's how frigging OLD i feel.

       10:25AM    A friend of mine doesn't have much money (he's a student) but he offered some money to help out the dog. Thanks for the offer B, you made my day! Save the money for some Krispy Kremes for me when you get back k? :)     A couple of months ago, I was so happy with life. And now it seems i'm so stressed out about so many things. Funny how one's life can change in such a short period of time. But, everytime i feel extremely pissed off, I just think of the people who are so much less fortunate than me. There's an old lady cleaner here who looks like she's 80, but i reckon she's probably 60 or so but looks older because of her weariness with life. She's deaf, she says she has a husband who steals all her money and many a time, she doesn't eat lunch sometimes cos she doesn't have enough money. How sad is that?

      Poor Doggie  Today was heartbreaking. Brought the doggie to the vet with his potential adopters and we found out he's actually quite old. He has heartworm and had tick fever before. He also has an unidentified lump. I have no money to treat him and they decided not to adopt him. This is so very sad because he has led such a difficult life and he's such a sweetheart. I feel incredibly helpless and have no idea what to do. Life is unfair sometimes.  I made a long term commitment to someone and I wish i knew if he's worth it.  On a brighter note, the SPCA found a cross poodle and i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it's you know who. I'll be going down on Saturday to see if it's him.

       11:17AM    Yesterday was a horrible day. I found out that the love of my life has been missing for four months. I was so frustrated that i wasn't told at that time, otherwise i could have helped look for him. I searched all over the web for possible clues of his whereabouts but to no avail. Wherever he is now, i hope he's doing well. I miss you, baby.     I think i'm getting old. went out for a beer at Wala's last nite with my ex colleagues and after 1/2 a frigging pint of Hoegarden, i was ready to crawl under the table for a snooze. This was at 10 frigging pm! i walked home and went to sleep straight away. Sigh. It's hard to accept i'm no longer young.  Mood: Agitated Music: Hoobastank - The Reason

Looking back, it seems there has never been one period in my life when i was truly happy. the scary part is, more than 1/3 of my life has flown by. I will grow to be an old cranky, wrinkly woman.

      9:05PM  It's funny how sometimes we let our imagination run wild and hype up our expectations of certain events. For example, a hypothetical one, if we chat with this person online, and that person's cool, funny and has a cool nick, we start imagining how good looking this person might be. And when we meet that person, it all comes crashing down when that person doesn't meet our expectations. That's life for ya.   I got so mad at somebody today that i  told him to fuck off and leave me alone for good. I don't mean to be countryism but Singaporean guys seem to be a selfish lot. And they're so much more different than Malaysian guys. If you have learnt stats before, i've only had a population sample of 3 Singaporeans, and about 5 Malaysians, but the my fellow countrymen still come up tops. I hereby vow i will never date another Singaporean guy for as long as i live. :) No offence meant to the S'poreans.   Mood: Mellow Music: Nothing

      7:10PM  It's really hard to believe that i've been single for nearly a month. Time really flies, funny how time seemed to drag when i wasn't single. Hmm... I'm surprised how much i DON'T miss him and how quickly i've moved on.   I can't believe England is out of the Euro 2004. Sigh. Now i'm rooting for Sweden.  Next week, i'll be going to KL on business. My ex, who's still a good friend of mine, is trying to devise ways on how to meet me for dinner Friday night and breakfast at the Hilton next Saturday. His gf doesn't like him having contact with me. I wonder what he'll concoct up as not to make his gf suspicious. I also wonder if he did this to me when we were together.

       7:24PM     One more day till the weekend. God, this week has been tiring. I'm getting old. Last nite, headed to Devil's for chit chat session with a girlfriend of mine. At 11:30 i was ready to go to bed and left. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? the music was good, good crowd albeit the presence of sleazy guys. I may be young on the outside, but i'm ancient on the inside.  Isn't this just the cutest thing you've ever seen?      Mood: Mellow Music: F4

       8:46AM     Ok, i've been thinking a lot these past two days. I know i've set my standards very high when it comes to guys and despite having dated so many guys, i've not found THE ONE. i've realised perhaps i'll never find him and so, to save me being disappointed time and again, i'm going to  SETTLE . The next guy i date, i'm just going to marry him and forget about finding love, cos the romantic notion of love doesn't exist. The definition of love is so subjective that we can define it any old way we want. You can love someone you're not in love with, and perhaps i've come to realise, love is more important than being in love.   As long as you know you can depend on the person to be there for you, and that person will go through thick and thin with you, that's enough. Who cares about your heart beating a million times a minute when you set eyes on that person? This kinda goosebumpy heartpounding shit fades after awhile.   OH god, i've turned into a bitter, cynical woman. :D On a brighter note, i've found someone who wants to marry me. Yay! I won't die an old bitter, cynical spinster. Someone from my past and i just made a pact yesterday. In 6 years, if we're both not married, we'll get hitched. This is provided, of course, that he buys me a Porsche Carrera. He agreed.

       3:06AM     This is the first time in yonks that I've been up at this ungodly hour. I am sleepy! Just wanted to post some things on my mind before i sleep.  Firstly, Portugal played horribly. Figo let me down. I really wanted Portugal to win, not only for them to give face to their fans and country (they're hosting Euro 2004) but because i placed a S$10 wager at half time for them to at least draw the game. But it was exciting towards the end nonetheless, because they were desperately trying to score. After 90 minutes of pulling my hair out in frustration and punching  urlLink his  arm quite a few times, Portugal finally scored. Phew.  I didn't feel like going out at all this weekend. Turned down mahjong, turned down clubbing, i was planning to stay home all day playing with doggie. I think i've reached a point in my life when i realise there's more to life than clubbing and shopping and expensive coffee. But hell, watching the opening match of the Euro competition comes naught but once every four years.  Someone was on my mind the whole night tonight. I wish that someone well and hope that someone's doing well.   Good night.  Mood: Sleepy Music: The whirr of my aircon

       8:49PM     It's weird how you can love a person one week and the next, feel nothing for the person. After having been in and out of so many relationships, i'm still clueless about the definition of love. Does love live in the moment? When you say the three precious words, do you mean right now, until next month, for a few years or forever? Someone should really define love and save the hassle of wondering whether we truly do love a person when we say it.   I have eye bags. I'm 23 years old and i have eye bags! The doggie wakes up at 5am and wants to play! in the middle of the night when she hears sounds, she barks non stop. Aish. I think it'll be easier to look after a baby. But, what the hell, i'm besotted with the lil girl.   can't wait to catch up on my sleep!  Mood: Mellow Music: Guy Sebastian - Angels Brought Me Here

       6:05PM     I've been single for 4 days and counting. Although it's boring sometimes, it's great not being stressed out when you argue. I don't know what's wrong with me. My relationships never last long. If it does last past 3 months, it won't last past 3 years. No one ever seems good enough for me. After awhile, I get fed up of their inability to meet my expectations and just break up with them. Perhaps i should start lowering my expectations. After all, i'm not THAT great myself. It's just that i want someone to completely blow me away and without whom, life wouldn't be worth living.   So once again, I'm single. And alone. If you'd like to apply to be my boyfriend/part time boyfriend/fling/more than friends less than fling, please download the application form and attach a non-returnable photo. You'll be notified by phone if you're shortlisted. Thank you.  On a much brighter note, i'm adopting a Jack Russell tomorrow. She's the most beautiful little girl i've ever seen and i'm totally besotted with her! I'll post pictures up soon.   Mood: Excited Music: Diana Degarmo - Don't Cry Out Loud

      I finally sold my SATC Season 6 vcds at a loss of 5 bucks. But optimistically, it's depreciation. After all, it's been sitting in my closet for 2 weeks. Dust might have collected on it, and i've watched it haven't i?   I have been having a run of bad luck lately. Firstly, i bought 2 tickets to watch the moscow circus tomorrow. guess what happened to them? i accidentally fucking threw them away, just like i accidentally threw away my sister's air ticket a few months back. Two nights ago, i was toe deep in shit. Literally. Didn't see the rascal leave her present in my living room and i stepped on something warm and soft. Sigh. I went to KL yesterday morning, and Thursday night i panicked cos i left my E-ticket in my office. I missed the last bit of Apprentice and the OC, took a frigging cab to my office, got my ticket and took a cab home. The next day, the lady at my counter doesn't even glance at my ticket. Worst thing is, boss brought a copy of my ticket for me. Argh.  I know it's hard to get customers early in the morning and gracious feline that i am, I asked the cab driver who sent me to and from my office to collect my ticket whether he'd wanna fetch me to the airport at 445am. So he picked me up at 445am. Upon reaching the airport, he asked if i was going to claim this from the company. I said yes and he promptly added the 5 bucks advance booking fee. See how nice i was?!!!! Then his fucking credit card meter couldn't work! i had no cash with me, i had to walk down two floors, withdraw money and walk up 2 floors and pay him. MORAL OF THE STORY: IT DOES NOT PAY TO BE NICE. He did give me a $2 discount though.   I was just venting. I'm  not  one of those people who start crying and get depressed or suicidal after a run of bad luck and look at the sky and scream "God, what the fuck did i do to deserve this shit?! Why are you picking on me? Why am i so sibei suay?!!" I takes things as they come, no point stressing over something that has already happened. I'm a cool cat.

      Today, I sent an unwanted dog to a foster. When i got home, the rascal sniffed me all over. She looked miffed and refused to eat her favourite treats. I'm sorry sweety, i did two time you and i promise to try not to do it again.  Tomorrow i'll be shifting to a new office! Hopefully my computer screen will be facing the wall so the boss will know not what i'm up to and i can play my yahoo games in peace.   Oooh it pisses the hell outta me when someone is indifferent. The more i want to get their attention. STOP DOING THAT!! I HATE IT!!   I have to say, besides not being able to stand people who type LiKe ThIs, i can't stand people who go like this..:  Today my boyfriend farted *chuckle*.  My exams are tomorrow *gulp*.

      Uh oh. It's nearing that time of the month again. I can feel the estrogen rushing through my bloodstream. I feel angry, sad and frustrated all at once. Guys should give thanks that the only hormones that affect them are testosterone. Easily solved with a shag or your right hand. hyuk hyuk.  Work sucked today. We had this huge enquiry from one of our customers worth S$500K. Sounds yummy right? Wrong. Usually, the big projects involve shitloads of changes, revisions.. you get my point. I've changed the stupid design 8 times already. My boss is rubbing his hands in glee at the huge amount, and he keeps prodding me to show more joy for the company at the potential order. I don't give a rat's ass about it because 1) i don't get commission 2) i do all the fucking work 3) it's so fucking frustrating to keep getting calls from the customer saying he wants to change the design over and over again.   I have lost all the enthusiasm for my job which i possessed when i first started. It's not something i'm enjoying, the benefits suck, the pay sucks, the only good thing about my job is that my boss is not a monster (heard 2 many stories about S'porean bosses). Guess that's the good thing about working for an angmoh boss. It sucks when you need a job to survive.  Oklah, enough bitching.

Braggers go straight down to hell when they die, together with the finicky.   Had a weird night last night. Quickie beer with feline friend and then another not so quickie beer with my ex. He wanted to know everything about my current love life which is close to zilch and he told me all about his. Sigh, I think going out and trying to be friends so soon with any ex is just too plain weird. We've already made plans to go for nice German food next month (at my expense because i owe him a dinner). I'm really too gracious a feline. Miaow.  Uh oh, my friend from Europe is drunk again, and he sounds horny.

      The rascal is adorable. First thing in the morning, she follows me to the kitchen where i hurriedly lay newspapers on the floor for her to pee. She sits down and watches me from the corner of her eyes. She refuses to pee until she's sure no one's in sight (shy shy like her mummy). I walk into my room, she listens raptly till she hears my footsteps fade, runs into the kitchen, squats over the papers and&nbsp;quickly pees. Sometimes in her anxiety, she misses the spot, but i reckon she has a 90% hit rate, so that's good enough for me.   Last night, I indulged and it was absolutely sinful. Had a mudpie AND a vanilla milkshake. :( Felt guilty after the indulgence, but what the hell, a person is allowed to falter on&nbsp;a Friday night.  It's a lovely cool windy morning. I'm tempted to stay in all day. Maybe I will.

      I hate automatic flushing systems. When I’m sitting on the toilet and fidget a bit, the stupid sensor senses it and the toilet flushes. My poor arse is drenched in toilet water. Lesson learnt: Keep very still while sitting on the toilet.  It’s finally Friday. I got through this week effortlessly although it was just another uneventful 5days. It’s nearly August and time is flying by so quickly it scares me a little.   Oooh, the Apprentice is fantastic! If you need a good dose of bitching and backstabbing to keep you on your toes, this is THE reality series for it. &nbsp;This series is enough to satisfy my weekly cravings for reality TV shows and that’s saying a lot!  What do I have planned for the weekend? Coffee tonight, dogrun tomorrow arvo and coffee tomorrow night. I don’t know why I say coffee when I don’t drink coffee at all. Sundays are reserved for laundry and quality time with the rascal.   Have a great weekend everybodeee!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Wrote a short note to my most recent ex yesterday to say hi and ask what he's been up to. Gracious feline that I am, i always try to maintain a good relationship with all my exes. Up till now i think i've pretty much succeeded in doing just that, much to the admiration of my girlfriends (they are on bad terms with most of their exes). Actually, there is one ex in particular i can't quite penetrate. We haven't seen each other since the day we broke up, despite me msging him once in a blue moon to ask how he is, I am always ignored. He hates me with a passion and i'm flabbergasted as to why he does so. I am also secretly pleased to have the power to provoke such hatred in a person.   I mean, our breakup was very very bad, no doubt about that. Yet, it was a mutual decision that doesn't warrant such hatred. Don't get me wrong,&nbsp; i don't really care whether he hates me or not, but i think it's the challenge of breaking through his walls. I'm not quite succeeding just yet. Yes, call me bitch if you want... all together now... BITCH.

      2:06pm &nbsp; My colleague just went off for the day. I told her i'd cover for her. It's her husband's birthday today and she wants to go and buy flowers and a cake for him. She told me, every year, they'd take the day off work to spend together at home. At night, they'd go to their favourite seafood restaurant at East Coast with the family. How sweet to keep the romance alive even after 30 years of marriage. Her husband died last year though, but she still keeps his memory alive. How hard it must be for her to be alone after having someone's hand to hold, someone to snuggle up with at night and someone to love and cherish for so long.

      I don't mind it when i'm supposed to meet a friend at the shopping mall and she turns up 20 mins late. I can browse around on my own or try on some bootiful clothes. BUT, when my friends are late for movies, I get furious. People who don't have the common courtesy to arrive BEFORE a movie starts piss me off. I don't care if i miss the trailers, but if i miss the start of the movie, that really irks me! Sigh, my friend was late yesterday, but i forgave him because he was very apologetic and bought me dinner. So all's forgiven. By the way, King Arthur ain't that good.  &nbsp;  Whilst on this topic, i realised girls are more often late than guys. There was once i was supposed to meet my girlfriend at Devil's at 10pm. I called her at 9:30 to make sure she was on her way before i left. Yes she was in the MRT approaching Bugis. Great. I arrived at Devil's at 9:50 and stood outside tapping my my foot impatiently. At 10pm, she msged saying she'd be late. Fuck, i thought, maybe the train broke down. But apparently, this idiot had gotten off the train at&nbsp;halfway to buy dinner! She arrived at 10:45, took 15mins to eat her dinner, and we went in at 11pm. THIS is the reason why i hate having girlfriends. I can't show much of my displeasure at girlfriends, because despite being inconsiderate and plain dumb, i can't show them my displeasure because they're also sensitive n take offence! Or maybe i have the wrong girlfriends.  &nbsp;  Mood: Hungry  Music: Rasmus - In the Shadow

But hell, all good things must come to an end.  &nbsp; I'm watching King Arthur tonight. I realise something - when i'm in a relationship, i abandon my social life. And every time i'm immersed back into singledom, i have to slowly crawl back into&nbsp;and piece back with superglue, what&nbsp;social life i had before the last relationship.&nbsp;I don't know why the two can't mesh, but i kinda like it that way. :) It seems that i don't like to focus on more than one thing at a time, is that a good thing? &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I had the worst nightmare ever last night. My boyfriend (have no idea who it was) and I were driving along the Penang Bridge (I was the driver) late at night. I know it was late because it was dark and there were no cars on the street. I saw the speedometer needle at 150km/hr and while going round a bend on the bridge, I leaned over to kiss him on the cheek. The car instantly skidded, I jammed on the brakes as hard as I could but to no avail, we hit the railing and the car flew off the bridge into the water. Everything was happening in slow motion, it was as though I was a third party watching the scene. I was fortunate enough to be thrown out of the car before the car sank.   The next thing I knew it was morning, and I was watching the car being pulled out of the water. The rescuers opened the car door and my dead boyfriend fell out. I went into hysterics and at that moment, I woke up with a start. What a crap way to start my day!   Anyway, today is probably the closest day Singapore can ever get to winter. It was windy, cool, raining and gloomy. I love this kinda weather. It’s perfect for sleeping and reminds me of Oz. 

      10:51AM  Everyday when I get home, the dog sniffs me like a suspicious lover. She sniffs my legs, arms, hands and when she finds the scent of another canine, she gets even more curious and starts sniffing my handbag trying to figure out who the mysterious canine is. Not one day goes by when I don’t get “interrogated”. I found it cute at first, but now, I think it’s getting darned annoying, but I love her all the same.   I cannot believe we’re past half the year already. Time flies all too fast, and still I’m not having fun. I’ve planned a trip to Oz again in September and another to Hong Kong in December for shopping. Ahh, that’s better.

      7:06PM  In case you're colour blind, I've got a new blog template. Didn't realise standard templates from blogger have improved drastically till Mr. Miyagi said so. Cool. Anyway, this is plain and simple and i prefer it to my earlier one where i had to constantly squint my eyes to read what i'd posted.   Have you ever regretted NOT doing something so much so you feel like kicking yourself in the head? Yesterday, HE wanted to come over cos he said he had a good reason to (read previous entry), and in my half concious state I didn't bother to ask what. Now, i'm curious as hell why HE wanted to come over, yet i don't want to ask him just in case he thinks i'm still pining for him. Which i'm not. I need a life. So help me God.  Read a book today, while snacking on junk food. See, this is what happens when there's no one around to look out for me. I get complacent when it comes to my health and don't bother eating proper meals. That's why i'm a picture of prosperity when i'm single - fat and frumpy cos i simply can't be bothered.  Oh, a friend of mine, who's in Europe started chatting with me this morning. It was about 2am there, and he'd just come home drunk. Besides the usual polite conversation about how i'm doing here, he moaned almost desperately that he was horny as hell and started flirting like crazy. Guess he wanted some cybersex:) but i'm not into that kinda shit. Takes too long and fingers hurt from incessant typing. Soon after, he found a free porn website and went off to satisfy his urges. I miss him.

      10:07AM  Last night was scary. My sister and my housemates were not around, so Didi and I were the only ones at home. The weird thing is, i kept hearing noises right outside my door. I heard my sister's door opening and closing, I heard footsteps outside. Needless to say i was as scared as a mouse. Went to sleep with unbrushed teeth, yucky huh?  Finally fell asleep about 2, and was rudely awoken by the ex at 4am. He was drunk and wanted to come over. Got slightly pissed off when i said no and i could sense the beginning of a senseless drunken argument erupting, so i hung up and set my phone to silent mode. Didn't get back to sleep till about 5. I can't stand inconsiderate drunk people. For fuck's sake it was 4 am and there were ghosts in my house!   Mood: Sleepy Music: Nothing

      5:24PM   I was clearing my closet today when i came across 2 photo albums. They were hidden in the deep recesses of my closet and for very good reason too. I'm unsure whether or not to throw them away, I'm not sentimental enough to keep past memories, but i wonder whether i would want to walk down memory lane when i'm old and wrinkled. Are these memories worth keeping? Would i want to look back at these memories? I don't know the answers, so for now, in my closet they'll stay.   Yesterday some guy working in the same building as me asked me to go clubbing at Centro. I balked at the very idea of having to dress up, get into the mood of clubbing and nursing a hangover the next day. I chose to stay at home and slept early.   The dog puked on my bed again last nite. This is the third time in 3 weeks that i've had to change my sheets. I think the poor dear can't stand the aircon.   Later, i'll be going to satisfy my craving of Swedish meatballs.

She did her business early this morning and promptly jumped on my bed and dragged her butt across my comforter, rubbing her a-hole on it to get rid of the itch. Advice that was given to me was "Pinch her a-hole at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock and squeeze hard. Smelly liquid will squirt out, just wipe it off". I am NOT looking forward to that.

      10:52PM  What do you do when someone asks you "did you love me when we were together?"? It was a short and bitter 2 month relationship nearly a decade ago. I don't remember much about it yet i didn't have the heart to say no. So i said "Up till now I don't know what love means, but i think i did." and that made him happy. That's good enough for me. Sometimes white lies are a necessity. When i asked the same question back he replied without hesitation "Of course i did" and to find that out 1 decade later, i feel humbled.  My boss was horrible today. He had  to finish some last minute assignment and made me go all the way to the airport to pick up a Vietnamese colleague of ours. I brought him to his hotel @ Orchard road and then to makan at the food fest nearby. One hour later, after queueing in the sweltering heat, we finally got to chomp on stingray, lala and other Singaporean food. Was quite worth the wait though and he was a charming funny little fellow.   Mood: Tired Music: Bryan Adams - Please Forgive Me

      5:17PM  OK, despite my last entry, i had a blast in KL. I was reminded how good it feels being in your home country and knowing you grew up there (well, most parts anyway) and that you're always welcome there. I love the nightlife in KL, the way all the clubs light up enticingly with all the hot chicks crowding the entrances of the clubs. The definition of beauty in Singapore is one who is skinny (with or without boobs), rebonded hair and wears revealing clothes (despite having nothing to reveal). Even if you have the face of a gargoyle but you meet the three requirements, you're still bootiful in singapore. In Malaysia, it's different. Even fat chicks dress sexily and have the confidence to pull it off and they're considered beautiful. That beats the superficiality in Singapore, and i love that.  I met up with an old flame in KL (well, two actually) but this particular one was someone who i hadn't seen in 8 years. He's still the same old person and i'm full of admiration for him. Due to an unfortunate accident a few years back, he's wheelchair bound. Yet the energy, confidence and charisma that he exudes makes one forget that he's different from the rest. He was smooth and sweet and made my heart pound a million times a minute. RESPECT (as Ali G put it). It makes me realise that life could be worse and we should be grateful for whatever we have.  Also, before i left, i found out the ex is attracted to one of his colleagues. Bitch that i am, his attractiveness soared in my eyes once i found out he was over me. Bitch that i am, i flirted openly and hinted that my interest in him hadn't waned. Bitch that i am, i lost interest again when i found out HIS interest in ME hadn't waned too.

       I am fucking pissed off. At the beginning of each month, I pay the rent in advance for my housemates and myself. For one of my housemates, I literally have to beg him for the rent every month. Earlier this month, I took $90 from him and then $50 last weekend (easier this way) and since his share of the rent is $190, he still owes me $50. I asked him very nicely for the remaining $50 and he claims that he definitely does not owe me so much. I am very careful when calculating these figures and in no way would I cheat anyone of their money, much less my friend of 5 years. Fuck it. I told him to fucking pay me the full amount at the beginning of each month and no more friendly instalments. That's what you get when you rent a place with "friends".  On a brighter note, I just got back from Wala's with   urlLink  kitten    and his friend. Downed a pint of Hoegarden and makaned before he dropped me home.  I am still pissed off.

       I caved! Shit. Despite keeping myself busy yesterday and stuffing my mouth with plums and peaches, I caved. I was on cloud nine a couple of days earlier knowing i possessed the determination and willpower, but all my effort was in vain for I caved.         Work sucks. Everyday, i leave the office with a pounding headache. May it be cos of the lack of oxygen in the office or the annoying calls from customers every few minutes to rush me,  to change the specs etc, I am a troubled person when the clock strikes 5:30. To top it all off, i'm reading a book called "Millionaires are from a Different Planet" and this fuels the dissatisfaction inside of me for i know i will never be a millionaire should i stay on. Yet, the inertia in me is equally strong and if i've always been half hearted about everything, I'm even more so now in finding a new job.      The rascal just dragged her raw chicken wing onto my freshly changed sheets. Shit.

       Some people live in a world of their own. That world revolves around them and they’re the king – nothing is allowed to be said against them. When someone says something negative and the truth hits home so hard, they turn around and cut off your head. They choose to ignore what is said and hold on to the self centred belief that they know best and they are right. These people are made because their parents worship the ground they walk on and constantly praise them. Their ego is inflated such that they have to find a mate who worships them the same way, stroke their egos and feed their narcissism. They prey on potential mates who have no self esteem and take advantage of their weakness. I find that pathetic.

       Fuck. Will somebody please tell me how you get only the title of the frigging blog entry in the recent posts section?! Practically the whole sentence shows up on mine. This. Is. Frustrating. The. Hell. Outta. Me.  For the 5th or 6th time in 2 weeks, i ate KFC again. Many people who eat the Hot and Crispy Chicken get sore throats after eating it. It happens to me now and again, but i don't care. I think their secret recipe includes heroin or some addictive drug cos i for one am hooked.  Singapore Idol starts now. Feline out.

       urlLink  She    so very kindly bought me shampoo and conditioner from Taiwan. For the past two weeks, i've been using both and since i can't read chinese words, i wasn't sure which was the shampoo and which was conditioner, so i mixed them both. Yesterday, i asked   urlLink  him    which is which and apparently, they're both conditioners - one for normal and one for frizzy hair. Which goes to mean I have not been washing my hair the past two weeks, just conditioning it. Shites. :)

       The craving's definitely there (I NEED MY MORNING SMOKE!). But it's controllable. I always thought i'd be like some heroin addict gone cold turkey - you know, getting sweaty and the uncontrollable shakes. The ironic thing about quitting is that i just ordered 5 cartons of ciggies from my friend. Somebody please buy some from me.  Twas some crazy dream i had last nite. Dreamt i was driving a modified Subaru and i could frigging drive a manual car without the car dying on me or jerking. Whoa, my dreams get better and better. By the way, it's a rarity to see a Subaru in Malaysia. I didn't even see a TS much less a WRX or Forrester. All i saw were modified kancils. Hur hur.  Oops i forgot to mention i went to watch The Village last night because of   urlLink  his recommendation.    I think Sixth Sense was much better. Do not ever watch a movie in Lido Cinema 4, the aisles between rows are too small. i crossed my legs and couldn't uncross them and the stupid lady sitting in front of me had very curly hair which kept tickling my knee.

       I arrived in JB today and had no clue how to get my arse back to Singapore. Thought i could take a cab from Senai but it cost RM160, which i think is a ridiculous amount. I met this guy who almost literally held my hand all the way to Singapore. He told me how to get there, paid my bus fare for me because i didn't have small change and made sure i kept my ticket. I was ashamed at how ignorant I was. So if he ever reads this, i want to say thank you very much for being so kind to such an ignorant idiot.  My trip was fantastic. The food was excellent, I got to meet old friends and spend time with my family. Everytime i go back, I'm always scared it'll be the last time i see one of my grandparents. They brought me up when i was a kid and my granny is the coolest granny on earth. She goes clubbing, she karaokes, she takes ballroom dancing lessons, she's a marvellous cook, she's just fantastic.  Something incredible happened to me when i was back. I didn't smoke much when i was back home. And it was fucking easy. I always thought "fuck, die liao, i'm doomed to smoke till i die". But i realised it'a a matter of  mind over matter . And finally, i realised i can quit smoking. Next week, i will a smokeless sexy minx once again. You'll see.

         I got another pressie today, this one from Thailand. The lil flower inside is made of soap. Pretty, yes?  My friend K just went to Thailand on a business trip. He's from a big MNC and he went there together with his colleagues. I was disgusted when he told me stories about his big bosses going to the red light district and bringing hookers back to the hotel. These are supervisors, managers and the big boss of the department. All of them are married, some with kids. Some were nerdy and were the ones least expected to go. But they did all the same.  I have a big dream. If i ever am bestowed with shitloads of money, i'll open a joint (KTV or a club) for  ladies only.  These ladies will be served by half naked gorgeous hunks and they'll be given free reign to treat these hunks however they want (much like the KTVs here). I know this is a lucrative market, because my girlfriends and I wish there were places like this. Not only will this open avenues for a "fun" ladies' night out, it'll discourage guys from going to the sleazy joints as well cos they know if they go, their girlfriends just might as well. ;)   Must remember to buy toto next week.

       I'm a loser. I blogged three times yesterday and i plan to blog that number of times today. For the next 3 days, I will be suffering blogging withdrawal symptoms, not because my hometown is so ulu but because our home computer is infected with some virus.  Nobody cares about what i write. I don't seem to wrench anyone's guts neither do i leave them weeping inconsolably. Instead, what they care about is the colour of my blog or my tagboard. Despite writing from the bottom of my heart and baring my soul for all to see, all i get are complaints about the colour scheme and insults from my sister.  If you had someone's email password and you guys no longer kept in contact and this person no longer means anything to you but you're kaypo to see what he's up to without having to ask him, would you? Would you type in his userid and password in sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type of anticipation of what would be waiting in his inbox? Would you read his emails and laugh with glee that nobody significant emails him and snigger to yourself because he joined a matchmaking site in secret and went for one of its speed dating events? Tsk tsk. Shame on you. And shame on me.

      Had sushi with one of the very few girlfriends i have (because girls whine too much and hate beer) and a beer @ Devil's. We were moaning and groaning about our pathetic lives and how there aren't enough good catches in Singapore. In the big sea of guys in Singapore, we're always hooking the ikan bilis or the small smelly fish you buy from the wet market for $1/kg to feed stray cats. Being complete bitches, we decided that if we want to hook someone loyal and devoted, we have to compromise on his looks. If we want good looks and wealth, forget the devotion and fidelity you expect out of a marriage. I guess it's up to us to realise Prince Charming does not exist. That's why he's found only in fairy tales and hooks up with some senile bimbo who can't find her damn shoe.  Life is becoming more stable now. I somewhat enjoy the monotony of the daily routine. Work, eat, clean rascal's shit, sleep. In 2 days, i'll be on a plane back to my hometown. I realised i don't need a man to make my life complete. Life's good. For now.

       I was browsing through friendster just now and was reading thru all the testimonials. "so and so is wonderful, he'll make a great catch. So ladies, what are you waiting for? Grab him now!". You may think your friend is a great catch but you know him only as a friend and not a boyfriend. Hence, when i have the time, i will create "EXTER" (TM). This is where you add ex partners in your list and they give you testimonials. That's the only way i'll be open to dating someone from the internet. "That fucker ah, caught him in MY bed with MY best friend"  Next.  "Fantastic boyfriend he was. Loving, sweet and attentive."  Next - if he's so wonderful, why did you let him go? Maybe he has only one nut.  "Great guy but likes to try on my lacy bras"    Has potential - i don't wear lacy bras.

      I just had to add this after reading  urlLink this  and  urlLink this .  When i walked past Kallang Stadium last weekend, i could see hoards of patriotic Singapore citizens garbed in red excitedly heading for the stadium. At that moment, i felt a stab of envy, mainly because i don't exactly feel proud of my country. National day comes, so bloody what? People here actually WANT to go and watch the NDP. Even if i was paid, i wouldn't go and watch Malaysia's.   The national service in Malaysia is laughable. Why call it National Service when you don't learn how to defend your country? To be honest though, I think if anyone attacked Malaysia, no Malaysian would get hurt cos everybody would have run off. Right from when we were born, we're faced with racial segregation. Certain races are favoured by the government. Do you actually think a 3 month camp will erase all that? Ha.   So when you Singaporeans tell me stories about how proud they are to have been in the army, I smirk cos i know not what national pride and patriotism mean. And i'm envious.

      I feel shitty today. My head feels like it's filled with cotton wool, my back and my throat hurt. Didn't want to take MC cos my boss is not around and so i can rest in the office. Plus, my colleague is eating snake for awhile later, so i have to be around to answer phone calls and stuff.  I just wanna go home and curl up under my duvet.   I was watching TV mobile amusedly this morning on the bus journey to work. Timothy Go was interviewing this supposed expert on healthy food. She whipped up some healthy stuff to put in your lunch box and explained why each individual ingredient was healthy. Interesting, i thought, especially since this woman was grossly overweight. If your food is so healthy, why are you so horizontally challenged?!   Sorry guys, i'm just a wee bit cranky cos i feel like crap.

      I get sinuses every single morning. I do a mighty good Darth Vader impression when this happens, much to my juvenile amusement. My nose is unpredictable. On some days, it stuffs up, on others it's like a leaky faucet. When i'm out of tissue, i wipe my nose with the back of my hand much to the disgust of the person sitting beside me on the bus. :) I'm disgusting.   I don't know if this is considered as the continuation of my bad luck run. Last night, i was sleeping ever so peacefully when i stretched languidly under the covers. My right foot felt cold and wet all of a sudden. My dog had puked all over my bed, a mixture of brown chewed kibbles, possum and bile. I love this bad luck run thingamajit. Nothing surprises or shocks or pisses me off anymore. I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.

      My run of bad luck continued yesterday, when i went to Kallang Indoor Stadium to collect my replacement tickets for the circus. NOBODY TOLD ME IT WAS NDP REHEARSAL DAY! What would have taken me an hour at most took me 2 1/2 bloody hours. There were so many detours and road blocks, i burned 3 gazillion calories walking. Dammit. Everything went ok today. I didn't lose my circus tickets this time because i handed it to  urlLink him  for safekeeping. Phew.  The circus made me feel like a kid again. I remember reading one of Enid Blyton's books about the circus and always wished i was a trapeze artist. Trapeze artists can walk around in G-strings and not feel worried that their arses are jiggling with every step neither do they worry that their arm flab wobbles every time they raise their arms.   I don't get it. How the hell do people save money? I'm not talking about Donald Trump or Bill Gates. I'm talking about ordinary working class people like me. I don't shop (anymore), I don't have a poor boyfriend to support, I'm a hermit, yet my money disappears and by the end of the month, i'm in the red. I can't seem to keep track of my money. Help!
