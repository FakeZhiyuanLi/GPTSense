      One day an english teacher of ours tells us moonlighting means indulging in wrong activities (robberies) in the moonlight. A week later another english teacher comes and during his introduction says that he is a moonlighter (referring to the evening classes he takes).  Does this qualify as a joke?

      "They didn't see me when I was quiet."  That's what some five-year-old said.  Thisis what he said how his day went.  "I got my name put on the board for talking," he said.  The teachers try to be strict about maintaining discipline. It's a good thing.  Even though they can't use the paddle anymore as they did in my day, they do the best they can with the techniques they are allowed to use.  If your name is on the board, you can't play during recess. You can't get on the swings, the slide, or play any of the sports.  If your name is on the board, you're grounded.  "I got my name on the board, but they didn't see me when I was quiet so I couldn't get it off."  Remember the last speeding ticket that you got?  They didn't see you when you were going slower and traveling at a reasonable speed.  Down the hill and in a hurry and here comes the blue lights.  They didn't see you when you were quiet!  The boss catches you just when you doze for a second (well maybe longer than a second) after diligently working all day.  They didn't see you when you were quiet.  Your wife catches your eyes wandering as you admire the architecture of an elegant building that just happens to have a shapely female in front of it.  They didn't see you when you were quiet.  Why doesn't the world take into account all of the times that you were quiet?  Why do you suffer so long for a moment's indiscretion?  How can a few minutes take an eternity to make up for?  Because of one of life's simple principles, it's a lot easier and faster to mess up than to clean up.  Harsh words uttered in five seconds can damage a relationship for five years.  All of us are still in school. We still have teachers. We still pass or fail tests. There are still paddles in one form or another and there is still the board.  With many of the things in our lives, we simply need to slow down and be quiet.  That way we won't miss playtime.

      I was incidentally watching Lux Style Awards 2004, and I have to say it was a total bomb. It made me start yawning during one of its earlier items (some Shao Lin Monks performance) by the time not even one award had been announced. Thanks to PTV this incident happened before even 7 o’clock in the evening had this show been telecast live at the usual late timings such shows have I guess it would have earned the distinction of putting to bed all of its viewers in a very short time span. Another eccentricity of the show was its host keeping on changing clothes. It’s like c’mon are you trying to suggest that this is a big budget show and we’ve got a large wardrobe. If yes then all I can say is grow up.  Yet I’ve heard that all people in the industry are saying that these awards are getting better every passing year. If it’s true either the earlier ones were a big no-no or the start belied what the show actually was.

      At last the drama going on for the last thirty seven days on the political stage has completely unfolded. The incumbent premier has resigned and has asked his party chief to become the prime minister. The party chief in turn has accepted this post temporarily till the incumbent finance minister becomes a member of the national assembly and hence eligible to take the reigns in his hand.  At the end of this act the president will have his trusted finance minister Shaukat Aziz as the Prime Minister ensuring that there may be no change in faith when he doffs his uniform, an act that is presumed to considerably lessen his authority. For those naïve enough of the current political scenario I may add that retiring from the armed forces is a constitutional requirement for the president which must be fulfilled by 31st December 2004.   Let’s see how this interim political setup fares for those who call the shots and for the people at the other end of the spectrum.

      Yesterday I went to a trip to Pir Sohawa. Well apart from the fact that whether I enjoyed or otherwise, I did make some observations regarding that place as a picnic spot. The place relatively cooler than the main city, is good enough to beat the heat but the immense overcrowding makes it loose its charm as a good picnic spot. The hiking trail there is nice and long enough, and probably enjoyable, given that you go in a group of friends and not as family in which there are great variations in stamina. I found that to my expense when I was abandoned at around one-fourth the length of the track.  Anyhow, if you’re tired of your summer vacations and live in the twin cities, a trip to Pir Sohawa might give you a nice day off.

      Finally the people at GIKI's Admission office have proven considerate enough to post out the entry cards for the admission test before the test actually happens. The sluggish speed of all of their correspondence had made me believe that they planned to send the entry cards in time for next years admission test. Anyhow though we got the cards, it is a woeful reminder of the fact that the test is not far away, and we better sharpen up ourselves fast if we want to stand any chance.

      Pandora was created by Hephaestus (who was ordered to do so by Zeus).  All gods were summoned to give Pandora a gift.  Hermes gave her a golden box and told her to never open it.  Hera gave her curiosity.  Pandora was then sent to Earth.  For many years, Pandora wondered what was in the golden box. She was very curious.  Eventually, she opened it, thinking that the secret to life was in the box, but many foul creatures flew out, some of which were sorrow, disease, and pain.  She slammed the box shut, then peeked inside.  There was one creature left which escaped.  This creature was hope.  Always remember that whenever there are hard times or wherever there is foul kind, there will always be hope.

      Among the marvels of modern technology is also the ability to track the missed calls which were made by our friends and foes and the likes. We do not get a good night’s sleep, unless we have returned the calls of those who matter. We don't let any call go unanswered as long as we know that it matters. Don't we?  But how about the calls of " hay-yaa al-as-salaah and hay-yaa al-al falah " made from the neighbourhood house of our master, the Almighty Allah.?  Those calls are made five times a day and many a times they all go unanswered.  We do not either respond!!! Nor do we respect these missed calls. Do they matter?  Everybody can tell, if these really matter. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but surely in the hereafter.  Let us look at ourselves. Can we afford to let these calls of the muezzin be missed, day after day, after day.  The call from our cherisher, sustainer and the ultimate master.  Just think about it.  Next time one hears this call, just ask yourself how good a night’s sleep can I have by missing those calls from the house of Allah  Think about it....the answer may come from the inner heart.

      Whenever contemplating what sort of life you have, remember that there is only one thing that defines human life. That single thing is "Relationship". The human mind being the limited self-conceited jerk it is made as by default, these relationships are governed by either social and cultural norms, or by the real truth of life, "Spirituality". In turn this spirituality requires its own food. Generations have taken music to be the very food for the spirit, not realizing that music itself can not be defined, a heavy metallic song vis-a-vis folk music tells the whole story. The real food of spirituality is the set of beliefs one has regarding life, the seen and the unseen. This very set is known to contemporary man as religion. Whenever thinking where you stand in life go over all these points and decide what you have chosen for yourself to define life, is it really you own choice and do you have any better alternatives.

      Today (Wednesday) as I headed towards Islamabad ready for an upcoming confrontation, I happened to notice a lot of ambulances amongst the traffic. Later enquiry showed that an overloaded bus was struck by a trailer on a bridge in the morning, throwing it into the ravine killing at least 40.  As far as the confrontation was concerned it just didn’t even start, much thanks to the feeble attitude of the other party involved. But on the other hand another confrontation did happen though I have no idea what prompted the start, I am sure that my indifferent attitude added fuel to the fire which was totally uncalled for. As for as the progress of the day is concerned, another accident happened as a plane slipped off the runway, while landing at Chitral airport. Though no body was hurt the Fokker did sustain quite a lot of damage.  Oh and another incident at the academy at Islamabad some doctors from an engineering school SS-CARE came and had a brief presentation. With a fancy slogan of “Bringing Pakistan on the Technology Map of the World” and with an aim of becoming one of the best colleges of the world, they thought that they could allure some whiz kids to their program not even realizing that as long as they are affiliated with UET Taxila, no one with a place at UET or any other better ranked university was even going to come near them leaving only the optimised trash to achieve their aims with.

      Tuesday was another off season rainy day here in the twin cities. I’ve been kept asking others, in vain, the origin of these rains and I guess its high time that I should try look for it myself. Although rain should be longed for in an arid country like Pakistan, these rains are wreaking havoc on the poor wheat farmers.

      Today I was watching a boring program on TV when it gave a good lead on certain interesting information. A mountain, located near Quetta and dubbed Jabl e Noor ul Quran,has been tunneled extensively and is kept as a sort of permanent store for now unusable pages of the Quran. According to tradition pages no more usable are either buried or put in a flowing river. Some Haji had a brain wave and decided to start this project to protect forever such pieces of holy script.  Yesterday I went to an academy in Islamabad and what a brilliant English teacher I get to meet. According to him an off day can only refer to holidays and not days with less than regular activity (like on and off seasons for sports etc.) and the meaning of overrated is only excessive and has no relation with its etymological root rate. Snubbing me over my attempts to correct his fallacy he started taking refuge behind the fact that the books answer supported him (we were doing an MCQ) not realising that his was a lucky case where two wrongs made one right. Another bunker of his was that the word fishy has no relation with its root fish, again missing that fish is known to be slippery and any dubious or fishy deal doesn't come to the eye completely as something slippery doesn't come to the hand completely.

      At Michni Post, the last fortification short of the Durand line, we had a briefing which I myself found interesting but to someone who had been there before it would have been very monotonous and boring. Right in front was the Torkham border post and slightly on the left (south) was the Timor lame prison where he handed out sentences to people. I wished I could have taken picture of it especially after having a peep of the area through the field glasses, but alas I had no camera on me. Also at Michni Post were some remains of the rocket fired by the Soviets during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the remains salvaged by the Khyber Rifles were duly put on display. Around the border were various observation posts with names such as Big Ben and Little Ben and also some with slightly local names.  Another interesting fact I came to know about there was that the National Highway Authority (of Pakistan) had awarded a contract to Frontier Works Organisation (a semi military setup of Pakistan) to upgrade and rehabilitate the road from Torkham to Jalalabad. The entire area being in Afghanistan, why were all the parties involved from Pakistan?

       First of all I would say that seeing the building closely associated with N.W.F.P. in general and Khyber Pass in particular is in itself an experience; as is seeing any textbook phenomenon on ground. First stop across that building was Jamrud Fort, a hastily yet productively built fort by Hari Singh a Sikh leader within 57 days to resist the British onslaught during 1850. A mud and stone fort with three perimeters and eleven gates it withstood the British for quite some time and in recognition they also dedicated a town to the name of Hari Singh (Haripur). Around the Fort was some sort of a base camp of which I could gather no useful details but at least can acknowledge that it was well camouflaged. Further on the Pass came the Shagai Fort, marked at its entrance by a non operational wind vane. The history of the vane, as I was told was that a senior official on his tour to some country saw many and was deeply impressed. The first thing he did on his return was to get one erected outside the fort to power it. The operational life turned out to be less than twenty four hours and ever since it is just a show piece. Further lay Ali Masjid Fort, Landi Kotal Fort and the Michni Check post after which the pass led into Afghan territory. Along the pass was also a great water supply scheme designed by the British during the colonial era in which a major reservoir was Mirza Talaab. Alas, it was ruined when the Afghan refugees came and the resultant overuse dried many springs leading to an overall shortage of water in the region. Remedial schemes include a large project at Shalmani with the crux to pump up water to Mirza Talaab. Also along the length of the pass was a dead railway and I don’t know till what point was it operational as from when I started noticing it was all broken and the tunnels through which it passed were blocked by land slides.

      Headed towards Kohat via Peshawar, the first mentionable thing I saw was the private police of the political agent to Dara Adam Khel amassed at the entry to the agency. Initially I thought that the men were of the Frontier Constabulary and there might be some Jirga going on in the vicinity. Only when corrected did I realize that the men were there to prevent the entry of Jamaat e Islaami Amir, Qazi Hussain Ahmad, into to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Talk about double standards.   Anyway at the other end of the Agency lay the Kohat Tunnel dubbed as the Friendship Tunnel by I don’t know whom. At first sight it awakened some of my hard sleeping memories of being in tunnels; though the refresher has not potent enough, still I enjoyed the unique reverberating sound that is produced in such confined places. Surprisingly enough, the access roads were of good quality something that might be due to the tunnel being in its pristine years, or perhaps the contractor really was honest and good. Another point worth note about the tunnel was the large announcement saying no one is exempted the tax; though the constitution does allow exemptions on toll tax, which was also applicable on my conveyance and I was thinking whether the tax would be adjudged as toll or what. Finally at the collection point we were let straight through making a mockery out of the notice (at least that’s better than making a mockery of the constitution as was the case at Sang Jani Toll Plaza some years back).   At Kohat Cantonment there were two rather amusing things. First an advertisement of Rescue 15 stating amongst its services free registration of FIRs (as if it’s supposed to cost) and the other which was looking strange were the roads around Kohat Fort which houses 9 Div. The roads themselves weren’t all that funny, unlike the ad, but there being in a state surrounding something that is supposed to be a heritage site looker quite anomalous.

      Pakistan played Honk Kong Sunday as the fifth match of the Asia Cup progressed at the SSC. As Pakistan batted both the openers missed out on scoring but a huge third wicket partnership allowed Pakistan to post a mammoth score of 343.   During Hong Kong’s batting, Pakistan tried to play a grandfatherly role by allowing the underlings to play, bowling with part timers like Imran Nazir and Imran Farhat. Interestingly Farhat ended up with the best figures at the end.   As for the reward I got for criticizing the commentators, there was no transmission during the first innings, officially due to technical glitches.

       Today in the third match of the Asia cup, Pakistan vs Bangladesh, the lower middle order ruined any foundations of a high score that were laid by Yasir Hameed and Inzamam ul Haq. with around 200 on the board at the loss of only two wickets in forty overs, 300 was the score which should have been in the minimum. Instead what we see is that our lower middle order gladly trudges along at six an over during the last ten overs giving us a miserly 257 as the total.  &nbsp;  Later on, after all due respect to the Bangladesh openers, Inzamam went too late for the kill and too lightly. If you cant bowl out a team like Bangladesh in under forty overs, there is a fatal flaw in your claim "Bowling is our strength". An advice for the skipper, who most certainly wont be reading this, be aggressive in your approach on the field.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      If you can't feed a billion people, then feed just one.  If you can't hire twenty million unemployed, then hire just one.  If you can't support an army, then pray for one soldier.   If you can't cure disease, then visit one person in the hospital. One smile provides healing.   If you can't save the world, then improve your community; and if you can't improve your community, then help your next-door neighbor.  We can't save the world, but we can save those within hugging distance.  Don't give up. Don't become overwhelmed. We are responsible only for the people in our breathing space.  Charity begins with the next person you see. Charity begins with just you and just me. If everyone on earth felt this way, what kind of planet would it be?

      Finally the saga of admission tests concludes as far as I am concerned. Today the admission test of GIKI was so pathetic that I completed it in 30% time and I see no reason of how it can rank students by merit. It's design suggested it was to see how lucky one can be during writing the alphabets without a mistake. I think after this test and the reports I have heard about other tests, that all the hue and cry about NUST's test being ill-conceived is just a cry when people fail. At least the end of the tests mean I get rid of the copious restrictions I get for not studying.
