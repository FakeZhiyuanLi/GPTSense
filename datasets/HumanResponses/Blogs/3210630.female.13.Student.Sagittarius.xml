        ruby left today... what a relief. when she was here yesterday she wouldn't eat her ham, so i made up a song and danced to it in order to get her to eat it. it didn't work, but the song was really cool. (it's to the tune of that starbucks expresso shot commercial where they go roy! roy roy roy!)  "ham! ham ham ham! ham ham haaaaaaam haaaaaaaaaaam... ham's the food! nutritious and filling. got your bacon got your luch meat! comes from a pig, *clap*, innocent pork. then. it's. HAM" it was really stupid but it's fun. i swear i could be on the wiggles or something. anyway, that's it. oh last night my cousin natalie was really gettin on my nerves and was saying really mean stuff about people not as "cool" as her. when i said it wasn't respectful to say that about other people, she goes, (now this is a direct quote, people)  " NEVILLENATNAT: i didnt even mean to type that     NEVILLENATNAT: my fingers just type    NEVILLENATNAT: i wasnt even looking at the keyboard "    she was being so mean, and then swearing that her fingers just randomly type and she has no idea what she's saying. LAME. so then my friend sage, being as crazy as she is, asked for natalie's screen name so she could "mess with her". it was hilarious. sage was asking natalie how she stood on the topic of sexuality and people being gay, 'cause sage is gay and she was "taking a poll" (just an excuse to talk to her). it was so funny. you had to be there. anyway, gotta go. orthodontist appt. i might actually get my braces off. i've had them for four years. alrite. yeah. bye.

        ok. today i was baking a cake. (yes, i like baking cakes. sue me) and everything was going great... until i put it in the oven. about 20 minutes into the cooking process i smell something burning and looking into the oven and HARK! the cake as bubbled over and is now burning. i turn off the oven and open the door immediately to be engulfed in a cloud of dense, dark smoke. hahaha it was SO funny. turns out i put baking SODA in the cake instead of baking POWDER. what's the difference, anyway? but i thought it was really funny, even though i am banned from the kitched until further notice. :-D   since i get annoyed easily i decided to make a list of all the things that get me annoyed. just because. i'll keep it updated. hahaha. here it is:    people who walk really slowly in front of you  people who try and get other people to feel sorry for them  people who lie, and it's really obvious, even though they deny it  misha barton- how fake  people who think that they are better than another person  clics  people who try and dress all ghetto when they live in suburbia  literalists- it's funny sometimes... but not ALL the time  people who repetedly say "what" after you said, "never mind"  people who whine about their "horrible" middle class life  when after you say something to someone, they just ignore you and pretend that you aren't even there, when you KNOW that they know that you are  steryotypes  girls who "flip" their hair  people who just can't admit that they're wrong  slow computers      mandy moore

        alright, since i have a lot of time on my hands, and my old blog was way more interesting, i'm going to give you guys a brief overview of what was on my old blog.       Tuesday, April 27 2004   well, today was a really long day. and i just had a lacrosse game. our record is 4 & 0. joy to the world. LACROSSE DEFENSE IS THE COOLEST THING. if ur offence is really good, then you don't have to do anything but check people. hehehe. oh- and to everyone reading this- one of the coolest songs ever is 'rockin the suburbs' by ben folds. its AWESOME. a new inside joke w/ the soccer team, but especially kristin is 'gimpy fin' from finding nemo; 'cause she has this dance that she does when she scores a goal, so i, being horrible in the areas of coordination and mimicry, looked like nemo with his gimpy fin & stuff. so now whenever she yells gimpy fin i have to do the demented dance and make a fool of myself. god i hate everything today. and i don't understand math. who is supposed to understand math anyway? you shouldn't have to take it unless you want to. &amp; we're having a test on monday i think and i still don't know what we're studying. oh & meghan had a fit on the interent last night that went something like this:   meghan: what the hell?!? why are you stalking me? and that poem that you wrote about me- really creepy. thats gotta stop. if you like me then stop writing creepy poetry about me, just come up and tell me you like me to my face!   chris: i don't like you   meghan:liar   chris: i don't know how you heard that i like you   meghan: through the grapevine   chris: thats a really over used saying   meghan: its vintage, but thats not the point   chris: what is the point?   meghan: the point is i don't like you and i'd NEVER go out with you. so stop stalking me. everytime i turn around... you're there! i'm not even in any of your classes. get a life. seriously. get a life.   chris: you have NO RIGHT to randomly IM me and start yelling at my for liking you. its not like i can control who i like   meghan: well you better start.    chris: (signs off)   now i don't know if i got that right, but thats pretty much how it went. but it turns out that: a. meghan asked krystle to sell chris this really ugly clay thing that she made in our clay class in order to try and get some money, which i think is a wonderfully brilliant idea because chris is rich, and he'll buy anything that will allow him to worship meghan even more than he already does. and b. meghan likes andrew. which i think is better than chris, but the only good thing about andrew is his hair. he has no personality, hes dumb, but his hair is AMAZING. in chorus today the teacher (linda) gives us this lecture about how me have to stop complaining about the horrible music she gives us because she likes to think that chorus is a democracy, but once she picks the music, 'she is our leader' she actually said 'i am your leader'. shes really messed up i think. everything is messed up i think. i really want to learn how to meditate. i know it should be intuitive, but it isn't. 'cause, see, i get really stressed and stuff already beginning to study for exams and my blood pressure is probably sky rocketing and i just like don't have a best friend to talk stuff out with except averyl and cristine, and averyl is in the grade above me and cristine is in a different school. and i'm really excited about going to my first away camp with grace and stuff which is stressing me out even more and i know i'm a little old to be just starting to go to away camp but it sounds like a BLAST. so i'm gonna go. for god sakes i need a vacation from myself. not to mention my history persentation is due on friday, which i haven't even started writing, i have a lacrosse game tomorrow and friday, i have soccer practice on friday, i don't understand math, and my mom is filipping out 'cause i haven't practiced piano in a really long time. i think i'm going to go take a nap.      Thursday April 29, 2004    hahaha i'm at school and i'm not supposed to be blogging and i have the odd feeling that i'm going to get caught. so i'll leave now. GOOD BYE MY AUDIENCE        Tuesday May 4, 2004    we won our lacrosse game 9-6. woohoo. oh and in chorus right before lacrosse we sang really well so linda (teacher) says (this is a direct quote- i wrote it down): "I LOVE YOU ALL! DID I MENTION I LOVE YOU? GOD BLESS YOU! GOD BLESS YOU ALL!" it was very disturbing. then averyl and i sit there while everyone else is singing saying: your mom, kevin(inside joke- don't want to go into it), your father, your brother, your sister, your mothuuur, your mommy... and it went on like that for a long time. then linda said that we were singing le mis ALL wrong and that we should pronounce the words more. for instance, she said that we were singing the song 'castle on a cloud' like this: "There is a castle on a clou... I like to go there in my slee... Aren't any floors for me to swee... Not in my castle on a clou..." which i think is perfectly fine considering the fact that we have to take some type of music class and everyone that doesn't play an instrument has to go to chorus no matter what so we have a lot of not so great people... no offence to the not so great people... but i think that linda should realize that. i'm tired. more sleee.... hahaha if any of you got that i'd be amazed 'cause i'm so stupid.        Thursday, May 20, 2004      oh man school was fun today. i'm writing this story for my pre-kindergarden book buddy and it's really fun. it's about this pig who eats to many lemons and turns yellow, then tires to turn pink again and finally eats a bunch of strawberries to turn pink again. &amp; my book buddy is so cute!!! he is a genius too. he knows what an underground water system is... 'cause we were drawing a picture of a tree and then he said that the tree had to have roots in order to get nutrients from the underground water system so that it could survive and oh my goodness he is smart. and today we played kickball 'cause one of our teachers wasn't there so we played kickball and I HATE KICKBALL. does anyone else hate kickball? i can't stand that game. its horrible. and i have the hiccups really bad right now. but anyway, i've officially decided to go to unionville high school and i'm so scared. i've been at my school since pre-k and all my friends are here and i'm scared... but when i told my friend will (who just started a blog) he was really happy and hes excited and so that makes me feel better.  (note written FYI on august 3rd~ i just found out that will might be moving to kansas after 8th grade so i might never get to see him again... sry just a note.)  and jen is trying to persuade her mom to let her go to unionville 'cause that's where all of her friends are. life is kind of scary. everything is changing so much. like next year all the girls in my league soccer team are going to travel soccer, and one of my FAVORITE teachers in the world is going back to canada, and then i'll be going to unionville the year after. i don't remember if i told you that i was in seventh grade... so i'll tell you now. i'm in seventh grade. and next year averyl will be in ninth grade and i'll never see her. i'm scared. thats all for now.      Thursday, June 03, 2004      it's late and i'm supposed to be sleeping 'cause i have an english exam tomorrow but i can't. averyl can't go. for god sakes. i hate all of the kids in my class and her grade rocks and i'm not allowed to skip a grade. i've already cried a bucket of tears and on the last day of school/graduation i'll probably cry a river and drown the whole world. thats a good song. but the dance is coming up, i got a modest outfit... except for my high heels... they're outrageous. in my mind. and at the dance averyl is going to dance with someone even if it takes me all night to get her to. and if she asks him, i have to dance with riccio. hahaha. he'll probably turn me down because he's so shy. we're friends tho. omg averyl can't leave. great. i'm crying again. averyl, i hate you for being my best friend. no i don't. i could never hate you. *cries more* this was the best year ever and it can't end. it just can't. i just read what i wrote and its not actually coherent. i think i'm depressed. and i'm not just saying that. i actually think i'm clinically depressed. my mom thought i was a few months ago. i may be. god i hope not. i just want everything to stay the way it is right now forever and ever.        Sunday, June 06, 2004      averyl didn't think the dance was fun but i thought it was awesome!! she danced with robert and i danced with a lot of people (including robert). *sigh* robert is AMAZING. he is so incredibly hott. i had so much fun. but anyway i'm not really supposed to be on the internet right now because i have a history exam that i have to study for... i don't know any of the material yet. oh well.           alrite well that's all that has been happening in this crazy life of mine... ;) and i'll just tell ya since it wasn't in my blog before (i know i'm boring EVERYONE...) i went to my cousin's wedding in june, i had a great time. me, my cousin nick (14) and my cousin casey (17) hung out the whole time. hahaha casey and nick are SO cool. and then i went off to camp for two weeks, where i had the TIME OF MY LIFE. and i met this guy named chris... i really miss him ;). we met during the saturday elective: cake decorating. he put icing ALL over my face. it was hott. anyway, that's all for now.

        ahh! that was creepy. i just got a phone call... and i say hello, i hear faint rustling in the background, then the people hang up. that's the  second   time in 2 days! i know it's probably someone who has the wrong number for one of their friends or one of  my  friends prank-calling me ('cause they know i hate it), but it's still creepy. especially when you're home alone...

        today, so far, has sucked. my 2-year-old niece ruby came over and threw a temper tantrum, and i thought it was really really funny 'cause she was flinging herself against walls and yelling "help me!! help me!!" in her little 2-yr-old voice. well, my mom got SO mad at me for thinking it was funny she banished me to my room for 3 hours like i was a 2-yr-old myself. i love my mom but she annoys the hell out of me. she's really mean to me. example: we got into an argument over nothing 3 days ago and she pulled my hair as hard as she could. now, i don't normally have a sensitive head but it really hurt. sometimes she slaps me... and i really think she has anger management problems. she can never seem to contain herself when she's angry or when i'm giving her constructive critisim on something. always ends up being defiant and somehow slaping me. and she calls ME immature... anyway... i asked if i could make cookies today (since there is nothing in this house to eat) and she said no, i asked her the reason, and she said because she would eat them. um, hello? that's kinda the purpose of making cookies. she said if i disobeyed her that i wouldn't be allowed to use the computer, watch TV, or call any of my friends for the next 2 weeks. am i the only one who thinks she is over reacting a little bit? or is this how all moms are? in my heart i know i love her but most of the time  i hate her SO MUCH. anyway, that's all that has been going on today. i got an allergy shot in the morning... that's all. life during the summer is boring. i have a lacrosse game tonight. nothing else new. i promise that once school starts my blog will be MUCH more interesting.
