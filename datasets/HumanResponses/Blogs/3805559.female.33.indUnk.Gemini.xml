      Here are the lists of things that we would like to buy:  Swimming Pool New living room furniture New dining room furniture New speakers for the Jeep Body work and a paint job for the Acura New floor for the kitchen New carpet or flooring for the living room  I guess that's about it for now. Well Jen wants a class ring and we both need more clothes.  Well, maybe that's not all: DVD writer Video Editing Software Wireless Data Access Point for the laptop to be networked in rooms other than the office.  Maybe that's it. Probably not.

      I am really trying to determine whether being in school is worth 3 more years of nights and weekends of studying. Will it really help me make more money? Will a new position help me be happier? The entry level programmers here are the same level as I am. Probably by the time I get my degree I will be making as much as I would over there. Hmm. Well, it will be portable in case we move, but we are thinking of putting in a swimming pool. If we do that, we need to be here for a while to get our money's worth out of it.   A swimming pool would be nice for entertainment and exercise. I think we might glass it in and have it heated so that we could use it year-round. That would be a great way to exercise if we would do it. If we don't use it, well that's money down the drain.

      I don't know what I will put in this blog, but have been interested in starting one. Today, well, I am working at AFLAC as an Intranet Coordinator. Jennifer starts her job tomorrow as a Graphic/Web Designer. We are both in school. Me working toward my Master's degree and Jen about to get her Bachelor's degree next Spring.

      I am going to stay in school. I have been wondering whether I should quit because of the time, money, and lack of sleep, but I guess I will hang in there for a little while.  Money, that's a different story. Jen just started her new job today. Sent her flowers. I think she likes them. This will really help our finances a lot, but it will take a little while for us to get back on our feet. We've been spending too much money these days. Having to buy new clothes and car tags and my medical bills. They have really tapped us out.  I miss Jen.
