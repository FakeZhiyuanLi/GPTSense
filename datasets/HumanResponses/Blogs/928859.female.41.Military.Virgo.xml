      Today is the day I enter in to the world of computers. Assuming things go as planned, I will post here often. I'm hoping to eventually move this to my site once I get that started.   So everyone, hop on and fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy ride!    Any comments or suggestions?  Feel free to send your wisecracks or kudos:   urlLink HERE.

      Update: I feel as though I got a good workout today even if I didn't do the standard form of exercise. I was able to do a lot of my cleaning today. The next thing is to tackle the downstairs bathroom (1/2 bath) and dining/kitchen area. The reason I didn't finish today was because I decided to take the time to go through all of the kids’ toys downstairs and eliminate a lot of them. There was just so much. It has been a long time since I've done that. I was ruthless. Tomorrow we shampoo the carpets and finish with the rest of the house. It's a lot of work but it sure feels good to have a clean house when you are done. My husband has been tackling the laundry. We got way behind. Quite a few loads to go yet.   I still need to find the time to do my paper tomorrow. I am a chronic procrastinator and this is not a good thing. I seem to do a lot better when I'm under deadlines and such. I would just prefer to get it done tomorrow so I'm not burning the midnight oil Monday.   It's really funny. When I'm away from the computer, I think about all the things I want to write about. When I sit down to actually do it, the ideas seem to go away. I probably should keep some kind of a list or something but that would mean I would have to be organized.   I've been working on some business cards for a friend of mine I met through Distributed Computing. When I finish with his, I'll start working on his wife's. That kind of thing is really fun for me. Lets me look into my creative side. It's nice and relaxing. Something I enjoy doing when the girls are both asleep. I get to play!   This is an interesting time of life for me. I've just turned 40 and am somewhat confused as to exactly where I want to go in my life. I'm nearing the end of school. I graduate October 27th. If you are within 9 units of finishing, you can walk so I decided to do so because then I could graduate with my classmates. Most of them are within a few courses of completing as well. I've been sitting in for my lead since the beginning of August, or there abouts, and that has been a true growth experience for me. It's made me really THINK before I act. I have a lot of people that I'm responsible for and feel quite strongly about supporting them in whatever they need. The politics is difficult to deal with, but I'm learning. Now I just need to figure out where I want to go in my career. Do I want to get into management? A staff job? What? I started off with the lead job and had no confidence in my ability to be able to handle it. It ended up that I've surprised myself. I've always done better when I've been thrown into a project with no life jacket. When my lead comes back, I've already been informed that I'll be given some special projects to tackle, along with what I normally do. This excites me, as I love to dig in and solve problems. One of them will be to figure out why our non-labor billings are so messed up. Non-labor is my specialty so I look forward to the challenge even though it is really going to add to an already heavy workload.   Looks like my husband is going to be away next week handling some jobs in northern (way northern) California. This isn't so bad as he has promised me he'll be here for my graduation on October 27th. That will be so nice. He's trying to arrange his schedule so that he will be in town for most of the time my folks are visiting.   My husband ordered me a new cookbook called "Cooking Light". There is a ton of recipes in there that look fabulous. I can't wait to try them out. I've really missed cooking these past two years. It will be so nice to get into that again once I'm completely finished with school.   I want to start working on this site to broaden it. I'd like to include an about me page as well as a gallery page to name a few. I don't want to start really working on that until I get completely finished with school though. I know if I do, the homework will take second place and I've come too far to do that to myself.   Well, ‘tis time for me to sign off for now. I've got a date with the midget terrorists to watch Monsters Inc. and eat popcorn. What could be better than that?   Take care all. Ciao4now...Moogs.     Any comments or suggestions?

      What a week. I didn't have much of a chance to play around with the site. As it is, I'm taking a quick break right now from cleaning my house and grabbing a bite to eat for lunch. It's one of those "my parents are coming for a visit this week" house cleanings." Why I feel compelled to clean every nook and cranny when they come is beyond me, but there you have it. I've talked to a lot of my friends and they suffer from this affliction as well. Seems to be a kid thing.   Well, I finally got the whole directive study problem resolved, albeit, not to my liking. It turns out I have to keep the instructor that was listed on my schedule. Of course, I'd already done the assignment and read the chapters for the first instructor. Figures the assignments are not at all similar. Turns out I ended up having to call the manager of the academic counselors to get it squared away. It seems my counselor was "confused" for some reason (his words) and emailed me the wrong instructor name. I explained to him that I had already done the assignment. Didn't do any good. All he said was "sorry for any inconvenience but there's nothing I can do." Well, the long and the short of it is that the instructor that was listed on my schedule gave me a week extension on the assignment because I didn't get it cleared up until the first night of class. He also granted me the extension with no penalties attached.   Work is going really well, albeit quite hectic. This is a busy time of year for us. We are just closing up a Fiscal Year and beginning another one. I'm sitting in for my lead while she is on maternity leave, so that makes things a lot more interesting. I can't really complain. The day goes by so fast but it's been a bit of a struggle to keep up. We have two new people in our group (I was just informed we're getting another one) and I've been training them. It makes it hard to keep up on my "real job' along with handling the lead responsibilities as well as training. I'm learning a lot though, so all in all, it's been a great experience.   The girls are doing really well. Both of them had a bit of a cold over the week but seem to be getting over it now. They are sitting on the floor doing each other’s hair at the moment.   I am busy trying to think of reasons not to get out of this chair and continue my quest for a clean house. Nothing really seems to be working so I guess I'd better get with it. It's not going to clean itself.   Ciao4now!  Moogie     Any comments or suggestions?  Feel free to send your wisecracks or kudos:   urlLink HERE.

      Well, here it is again. Early Sunday evening. What a nice relaxing weekend. I really didn't do anything much but sometimes that's a nice thing. I've just finished up all the core classes for my Bachelors Degree in Business Management. All that is left now are two electives, those being Organizational Behavior (which I start Monday) and a science class. Not too bad at all. It's been a long time coming. I'm taking these two courses by directive study, which means you actually don't have to go into the classroom but work with the instructor on-line. You don't have any idea how much that appeals to me now. After a little over two years of going to campus every Tuesday night from 6:00-10:00 and then every Thursday night for study group, it will be nice to actually be home. Between that and the time I spent in the library and in my office researching, I'm about schooled out for the time being. My girls are fairly excited that I'll be home a lot more now. I've been going to school part time pretty much since I graduated high school. I will be glad to put this to bed. I graduate October 27th...not that I'm counting the days.   Getting signed up for the directive study courses was something of a joke. This whole thing has taken me over a month and it's still not all cleared up! I have come to the conclusion that the people who work at the university are complete idiots. You know...they bought the happy meal but it doesn't contain any chicken nuggets? To be fair though, like all of us, I'm sure they are way overworked so it makes it hard for them to keep up. Still doesn't mean I have to "feel" charitable, just as long as I remain polite.   They finally assign me my instructor. Ok. No problem. I email the instructor with the email addy my academic counselor provided me. It was wrong. I called the school, get what I HOPE is the right one and send her an email. Well, it didn't bounce back but I didn't hear from her until today so I wasn't sure.   But wait..there's more. I go to check the university's website (I can check my schedule/grades, etc on-line) and 'praise the lord and pass the peanuts!,' they have my class listed on my schedule. Finally. Get this...its got a different instructor listed! Arghhhhhh!   So I emailed my academic counselor and asked, "what's up with that"? (that's the polite version) Of course, it's the weekend so I'm not sure what is going on. In the meantime, the instructor contacted me by email and by phone. We both agreed to go with it, even though it's not offcial..yet..   Oi, oi, oi. I'm almost done right?   But wait (oh no.another update)..I just got emailed by the instructor that was on my schedule! He told me what my assignment is and what to expect for the class..Ugh..now what do I do? I'll work it out tomorrow morning I hope.   My husband is travelling to Washington tomorrow. He'll be there until at least Thursday. He'll be servicing the east side of Washington. Hopefully, all will go well.   That's it for today! Take care all and Ciao4now...Moogie    Any comments or suggestions?  Feel free to send your wisecracks or kudos:   urlLink HERE.

      As I sit here at my desk, trying to remove the cobwebs from my brain, I begin to ponder the meaning of life, which has thus far, escaped me.  Both girls lying in my bed, watching Sponge Bob Square Pants and slowly waking up.  Nickelodeon has begun their  urlLink fright nights  which is a big deal in this household.  A feeling of contentment washes over me as I realize they have not once interrupted my early morning thoughts with   MOM!!!!  I'M HUNGRY!!!!!    Halloween is fast coming upon us, and I realized I have not made a move in the costume department.  Somehow, this does not surprise me. As the Chief Procrastinating Officer of Chez Moogie, I must strive to do my very best, which includes, leaving things until the last moment.  One would think I would realize I could decrease my stress level 100% if I would just plan ahead, and complete things in a timely manner.  Somehow, that message has never buried itself into the dark recesses of my mind, such as it is.  It looks like I'll have to do some research on the various websites to see what I can come up with...fast.  My friends have often asked me why I just don't buy a costume for the girls, and be done with it.  Bah!  That would be too simple.  Where is the fun in that?  The creativity?  Of course, I could just wait until the last moment and buy a costume, which would not go against my Procrastination Creed.  We shall see.     My Thoughts On Graduating  That is, of course, assuming I have any.  I'm really not sure how I feel about it.  It hasn't quite sunk in yet.  I think that once I am truly "finished" it might begin to sink in.  I have two more classes to go.  I am taking the last two as directive study, which means you work one on one with the instructor via email.  I thought these would be a piece of cake.  Color me purple and call me surprised, but that is not the case.  The homework has basically tripled, which, when you think about it makes sense.  You are not working with study groups (we call them learning teams) so you have to make up that work somehow.  The one I am currently taking is Organizational Behavior.  The next assignment is due on Monday.  Please, don't ask if I have finished it.  You already know the answer to that one, I'm sure.  The other one is some type of Science class.  My parents came out to see me graduate and this pleases me immensely.  I have worked long and hard to get to where I am and I am looking forward to having somewhat of a normal life.  That is, if one can have a normal life with children around.  I have had many people tell me that I won't know what to do with myself when I have no more homework to do.  Ha!  I assure you, that will not be a problem.  We are allowed to "walk" if we are within nine units of completing our degree.  Since most of the members of my group are in the same boat as me (a few classes to go), we all decided to walk together.  That will be nice.  At any rate, my folks will be there, as well as my brother, his girlfriend (who has the same first and middle name as me, but that's for another post) and her three children.  After the ceremony, we'll all head on over to my brother's girlfriends house, and have a celebration.  I am just wondering how my two midget terrorists will deal with a two-hour ceremony.       You Never Forget  ...or so they say.  When we bought our new car, we got a free bicycle to go with it.  We didn't know that at the time we bought it, but found out when we were filling out all the paperwork.  It is a really nice mountain bike, and since my husband already has one, it became mine.  Heh.  I have not ridden in ages.  Everyone always says that you never forget how to ride a bicycle.  This may be true but I can say that I am very thankful America's Funniest Home Videos was not anywhere near me when I made my first attempt.  I looked a lot like a Weeble.  Remember those?    "Weebles wobble but they don't fall down!    It is a somewhat humbling experience to have your eight year old daughter riding behind you saying,  "you're doing great Mommy, just take it nice and easy!        Little People and Legos  For some reason, Little People and Legos are the toys of choice, at the moment.  We have a Little People dollhouse, gas station, fire engine, helicopter, airplane and bus, as well as most of the Little People themselves.  The collection started with my eldest and kept on going through my youngest.  Same with the Legos.  We started with the Duplos and have various sizes.  Luckily, they are stored in one bin, in a vain attempt to keep them from becoming scattered in every room of the house.  There is nothing like getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, with no light on, and stepping on one of those little boogers.  Worse than a Barbie shoe, but I won't go into that right now.  But I digress.  Our house has become the "house of choice" to play in.  Yesterday, when the girls came home from school, we had eight kids over.  Yes, eight.  I had backed the car out of the garage (the other half is filled with "stuff" that could support an entire flea market) to give them plenty of room.  Basically, that garage became  The Land of the Little People and Legos."   There were bridges and buildings out of Legos, and Little People driving and flying all over the place.  Surprisingly enough, when it became time to clean up, all of the kids actually cooperated and everything is back in its place.    Well, that's about it for right now.  Today we go and spend the day with Grandma, Papa and Uncle.  Not sure what the plans are yet.    Ciao4now!!  Moogs     Any comments or suggestions?

       Hump Day   A smile for you:   urlLink Check here   Now that I've got that out of the way, I'll get on with it.  I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed this morning.  You remember when I said that I wanted to get a lot of stuff done today at work?  Well, it wasn't meant to be.  My eldest woke up with a bit of a stomach ache this morning, but after a while,  INSISTED  that she felt good enough to go to school.  I should have listened to my gut.  Let me just give you a little history about this one.  She has always  (well, for the most part)  loved school.  This year is no exception.  Even though she has a lot more work, she is having a great time.  The teacher she has is abolutely wonderful, but then again, all of the other ones have been that way as well.   It is difficult to tell when she is sick because:  1. She is a tough cookie, and 2. She loves school.  Getting her to tell you that she is sick is like pulling teeth out of a newborn.  But I digress.  Where were we?  Oh yes, my gut (and no, I'm not talking about the size of it thanks, that's for another post!)  At about 10:30 the administrator of her school called me and told me that she was sick.  I look at my calendar, made a few phone calls to cancel some meetings, and went in and told my supervisor.  I'm fortunate that my supervisor is an understanding sort when that kind of thing happens.  It makes it a lot easier.    The problem is this.  I feel as though I'm being pulled in two different directions.  I was brought up with a strong work ethic so it bothers me that I have to take the time off.  Part of me feels very guilty, as if I'm not doing my job.  The other part known as Mom, does not.  Don't get me wrong.  Before I get slammed here, I do know my priorities.  To me, my family comes first.  When my child is sick, she comes first, above all else.  Period.  End of discussion.  But....  This whole sniper thing in Maryland really bothers me.  Who would do such a thing?  There are rumors of it being terrorist related.  They also talk about the possibility of more than one person being involved.  My heart goes out to the family of the victims.  I feel deeply for the man who was with his wife at Home Depot when she was killed.  I can't begin to fathom the horror this man must have went through.  Imagine, not feeling safe enough to go to the store or to fill up your tank at the local gas station.  Who in God's name is doing this?  I really don't think the authorities have a clue but they are really putting forth the effort.    urlLink Update   Since the tragedies of September 11th, there seems to be more of this type of thing going on.  Granted, not on the same scale but they are happening just the same.  There also seems to be a lot of overreaction to certain situations as well.  I think that is understandable, but we really need to be careful not to go overboard.  That overreaction even extends to the schools to a certain extent.  My neighbors 8 year old son is very creative.  He is constantly drawing.  A couple of months ago, he drew a picture of a woman, and then beside the woman, a gun, and beside that a dog, with a car in the background.  The teacher confiscated the picture and he was escorted to the principal's office.  The long and the short of it is, he was expelled for potential terrorist activity.  I'm still trying to figure that one out.  He was basically drawing cartoons like he normally does, but they were trying to say that he was thinking of killing his teacher.  Can someone explain that to me?  And how did they tie that to terrorist activity?  If they were to take a look at some of his other drawing, Lord knows WHAT they would find there.  He has an active imagination.  He is only 8 years old for heavens sake and has never been in trouble.  If you read his report cards, the teachers always say how well behaved he is.  He is always telling us how much he loves his teachers.  Go figure.  We got into a discussion this morning about the death penalty first thing this morning while we were waiting for all the players to arrive for our early morning weekly status meeting.  I'm not sure how it started, but I can say I was NOT in the majority.  I am not, nor have I ever been, a proponent of the death penalty.  It doesn't stem so much from being brought up as a Christian (thou shalt not kill) but more of wondering just what is that going to solve?  Will killing this person bring the victim back?  What about the survivors?  By survivors, I mean, the relatives of the person who did the crime.  Why are we punishing them as well?  It got kind of heated at that point and I think I'm thankful everyone arrived before I go slapped up-side the head.  :)  Granted, I may very well change my tune if one of my loved one's is a victim....nuff said.  As my little one was sleeping off the virus that seemed to have taken over her body, I was surfing some of my favorite sites.  I have a few "journals" that I try to visit on a regular basis.  One of them mentioned homosexuality.  The writer (sorry J) mentioned that it was his opinion that homosexuality was immoral  (let me preface this by saying he had quite a bit more to say about it than what I am referring to, and I agreed with him on the rest)  Now, I realize the views on homosexuality from a Christian stand point.  This has been a difficult issue for me to deal with.  It is my personal belief that it isn't a choice.  We don't wake up one morning and say "gee, I think I'll be gay."  Well, yes, I'm sure that does happen on a small scale with people who are exploring their sexuality or trying to define who they are.  To me, as long as they don't enforce their beliefs on me, and vice versa, I've got no problem with it.  I'm not sure I see where they are hurting anyone or doing anything wrong.  Nuff said....  That's about it for today.  Take care all and ciao4now!  Moo    Any comments or suggestions?  Feel free to send your wisecracks or kudos:   urlLink HERE.

        ¨Pobody's nerfect¨     Happy Tuesday everyone!  Things here and Chez Moogie are going really well.  I finished my paper for the first week of class and got it turned in on Sunday.  Kind of feels good to have gotten it done early.  I've already started on my next week's assignments as it's going to get hectic soon.  My parents are flying in on Thursday   (remember the cleaning thing?),    and I graduate on Sunday.  I just want to see if I can get most, if not all of my assignment done before all of that.  For those of us who are ladies  (the men might be able to relate) , I've listed some bumper stickers I thought you might enjoy.  A friend of mine from work sent them to me.      Bumper Stickers for Ladies      BEHIND EVERY SUCCESSFUL WOMAN IS HERSELF    OH MY GOD, I THINK I'M BECOMING THE MAN I WANTED TO MARRY!     GINGER ROGERS DID EVERYTHING FRED ASTAIRE DID, BUT SHE DID IT BACKWARDS AND IN HIGH HEELS    A WOMAN IS LIKE A TEA BAG...YOU DON'T KNOW HOW STRONG SHE IS UNTIL YOU PUT HER IN HOT WATER     I HAVE YET TO HEAR A MAN ASK FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO COMBINE MARRIAGE AND A CAREER    SO MANY MEN, SO FEW WHO CAN AFFORD ME     COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, MEN ... SOME THINGS ARE JUST BETTER RICH     DON'T TREAT ME ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU WOULD THE QUEEN     I'M OUT OF ESTROGEN AND I HAVE A GUN    WARNING: I HAVE AN ATTITUDE AND I KNOW HOW TO USE IT     OF COURSE I DON'T LOOK BUSY...I DID IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME     DO NOT START WITH ME. YOU WILL NOT WIN     ALL STRESSED OUT AND NO ONE TO CHOKE     I CAN BE ONE OF THOSE BAD THINGS THAT HAPPENS TO BAD PEOPLE    HOW CAN I MISS YOU IF YOU WON'T GO AWAY?!    DON'T UPSET ME! I'M RUNNING OUT OF PLACES TO HIDE THE BODIES    And last but not least:    IF YOU WANT BREAKFAST IN BED, SLEEP IN THE KITCHEN     Work has been hectic lately, but that's to be expected this time of year.  I've spent the last couple of days putting out fires and that gets really frustrating.  You go home feeling like you haven't accomplished anything.  Hopefully, I can get a bunch of stuff done the rest of this week so I can take some time off while my parents are visiting.  Time will tell.  I am really looking forward to my lead coming back so I can get back to just doing my job, but it looks like the earliest that will happen will be the first week in December.   My husband has been travelling quite a bit in his job.  Right now, he is in the northern part of the state and will be driving to about three different other sites, slowly working his way down towards back home.  He's just thankful that he didn't have to get on a plane.  What's nice is, if he has to go to a site that is 60 miles or more from home, the company springs for a rental car.  For those areas that aren't, they pay mileage.  His project manager has just informed the group that he is taking a new job.  He also let them know that they have been actively pursuing new work for them all so there is some hope that the contract will be extended longer than anticipated.  That would mean that my husband would have longer to look for a permanent job, and also, he wouldn't have to go back on unemployment as soon.  Can't beat that.    Musings from a mom...    Picture one toy, sitting in the middle of the living room, not having been touched in several hours.  One child walks over to said toy and picks it up.  This immediately solicits a reaction from child #2  (THAT'S MINE!) , subsequently, causing a riot in the living room, as well as sending mom to the bottle.  :=D  Why is it that when your pick your child up after a play date at a friend's house, the other child's mother goes on and on about how well behaved your child was.  Further more, she compliments said child on the fact that she was such a great help in putting away all the toys.  My general response is  who are you and what have you done to my child?   For further clarification, see cleaning post.  :D  How come your child is really happy when you pick them up from school/daycare, but the minute you get them into the car, they begin to cry/fight with sibling/moan that no one loves them anymore?    To those of you who have children in your lives, whether they are your own, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, or students...here is something to make you smile.  Does this sound familiar?     Whenever your children are out of control, you can take comfort from the thought that even God's omnipotence did not extend to His own children.   After creating heaven and earth, God created Adam and Eve.   And the first thing he said was "DON'T!"    "Don't what?" Adam replied.    "Don't eat the forbidden fruit." God said.    "Forbidden fruit? We have forbidden fruit? Hey Eve...we have forbidden fruit!!!!!"   "No Way!"    "Yes way!"    "Do NOT eat the fruit!" said God.    "Why?"    "Because I am your Father and I said so!" God replied, wondering why He hadn't stopped creation after making the elephants.   A few minutes later, God saw His children having an apple break and He was ticked!   "Didn't I tell you not to eat the fruit?" God asked.    "Uh huh," Adam replied.    "Then why did you?" said the Father.    "I don't know," said Eve.    "She started it!" Adam said.    "Did not!"    "Did too!"    "DID NOT!"    Having had it with the two of them, God's punishment was that Adam and Eve should have children of their own.   Thus the pattern was set and it has never changed.     BUT THERE IS REASSURANCE IN THE STORY!    If you have persistently and lovingly tried to give children wisdom and they haven't taken it, don't be hard on yourself. If God had trouble raising children, what makes you think it would be a piece of cake for you?    THINGS TO THINK ABOUT!     1. You spend the first two years of their life teaching them to walk and talk. Then you spend the           next sixteen telling them to sit down and shut up.   2. Grandchildren are God's reward for not killing your own children.    3.  Mothers of teens now know why some animals eat their young!!   4. Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually repeat word for word what you shouldn't        have said.   5. The main purpose of holding children's parties is to remind yourself that there are children  more awful than your own.   6.   We child proofed our homes, but they are still getting in.     ADVICE FOR THE DAY!    Be nice to your kids. They will choose your nursing home.   AND FINALLY: IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF TENSION AND YOU GET A HEADACHE, DO WHAT??? IT SAYS ON THE ASPIRIN BOTTLE: "TAKE TWO ASPIRIN" AND "KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN"  Have a good one!  Ciao4now!  Moogs    Any comments or suggestions?

            Toto, I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore!     I can’t believe it’s already Sunday!  Seems like Saturday just flew by.  The weekends are never long enough.  I think I’ll take this moment to clear up the real meaning of my name Moogie.  It’s nothing exciting I can assure you.  My eldest daughter is named Margie Ann.  When I went back to work after she was born, one of the kids at her daycare could not pronounce her name.  It always came out “Moogie.”  That nickname has followed her around since and I decided to use it as my own.  Nothing exciting I know, but there you have it.    I’m a great lover of emoticons and one of my good friends sent me a link that is fun to use with your email.  It's just a little something that is fun to play around with.  :=D   urlLink Check it out!   I really need to get started on my day.  I've got a lot that I need to accomplish and if I keep fiddling with this site I’ll never get it done.   I’ll sign off for now!  Until the next time, ciao4now!  Moogie CPO (Chief Procrastinating Officer)    Any comments or suggestions?  Feel free to send your wisecracks or kudos:   urlLink HERE.       If you don't want them published, please let me know.

        My response     Ok..first things first. I'm not that "Moogie" :) Have you seen the lobes on that woman? And she gives wrinkles a bad name.  :) And the teeth. My parents spent a lot of money on braces. :D  I mean, take a look.   urlLink Click here   As far as what the site looks like..I borged one of the templates offered and rearranged it to suit my needs :) I'll have to remember what Dr. Pournelle says and try to block out writers cramp.   Thanks so much for your kind words. I appreciate it. A lot of work has to be done on the site. But I'm looking forward to the challenge.   Ciao4now...Moogs   PS: Did I ever tell you how I came about the name of Moogie?   ==========================================================   Got a very nice email about the site but I can see I’ll have to clear up the misconception about my name.  ;)     [10/19/2002 9:20:48 PM | Laura Gerlach] From: John Dominik  To: Laura Gerlach  Sent: Saturday, October 19, 2002 9:00 PM  Subject: Re: Updates...beginning of a website.    Well, that sucks. In a week, you've got a better looking site than mine, and I've been doing this for over two years - and web design for five before that! ;-)   It looks great, and sounds good, too. As Dr. Pournelle says, just keep banging away daily. Some days the words come, and some days, they come after you've stared at the keyboard until little blood droplets form on your forehead... ;-)   It's now on my list of things to visit daily. However, you are aware that "Moogie" was also the name (unsure of the spelling) of Quark and Rom's mother on DS9 - and she was an uncommon Ferengi woman... Didn't go around naked, had a head for business... say, I'm starting to see some parallels here (assuming you don't go around in public naked... ;-).   Oh well - now to see what sort of trouble I'll be in tomorrow... ;-)  ==========================================================     Any comments or suggestions?

        TGIF!!!!    Finally!  I didn't think it would  EVER  get here!  What a week it was.  Work has been somewhat of a whirlwind, but I think that quite a few companies are like that now.  The work doesn't decrease just because of downsizing.  I love the term  redistribution of work , don't you?  I love how management approaches you when they want to give you more assignments.   Management:    Hey Moogs, will you come into my office for a minute?  I have something to discuss with you.    Moogie:    Sure thing.    (At this point I'm thinking, man...I really don't have time for this.  And then I get to thinking that maybe they are going to tell me that I've screwed up big time or they are going to lay me off.  But the time I reach the manager's office that is maybe 200 feet away, I've worked up a sweat, and my blood pressure is soaring.  A swallowing marathon is going on to keep the contents of my stomach at bay.  I'm wracking my brain to try to figure out what I did wrong.)  Mom, is this what you meant by backing the hearse up to the door?  VRRRrooooommm!    Management:    Thanks for coming (I look out of the corner of my eye and notice my supervisor is there as well - Uh oh).  We have a new contract coming up (the bells start wringing in my head) and we are trying to decide who we want to take it over as the analyst (I felt he blood rushing to my temples and my head starts to pound...I can see the writing on the wall) Your name keeps coming up.    Moogie:    Oh? (man, what a brilliant response Moogs).    Managment:    Well, we've been tracking your development and you are one of the more senior folks around (now, does that mean I'm old as dirt or been at the company for a while?)  You've really come a long way.  This is a really good opportunity for you as it's a three year development contract that could lead to something more.     Moogie:    Ahh! (I really need to think about a career in public speaking).   Now, while I'm sure that their compliments are sincere, and it does make me feel good, I also know there is an ulterior motive.  Why is it that management cannot just come right out and tell you they have a new contract and have decided they want you to be the analyst?  Granted, either way I would have jumped at the opportunity as it will be handled in a completely different manner than what I'm used to.  We'll be integrating cost AND schedule which is new to me, and after I've been on board for a while, I'll be one of the few analysts around who know how to do that.  That said, it is a great opportunity for me, but I've been around so long and have had that speech given to me so many times.  I just wish they would be straight with me and ask.  It's not like I've ever said no.  The good news is that since this is considered a full time contract, they will take the majority of my work away and give it to someone else.  The contract won't start until October at the earliest, so I still have time to fret about my ability to do the job.  VRRRroooom!   Nuf said....     BIRTHDAY PARTIES    Joy of joys.  Tomorrow we are going to a birthday party for a two-year-old that lives in our neighborhood. The mother just had a baby a few months ago, and sometimes my eldest goes over and entertains the two year old so that the mom can get some work done, or just rest.  The party is going to be at Chuck E Cheese  (Lord help me)  so I would imagine I'll need a lobotomy when it is all through.  I really don't mind all that much as the girls are terribly excited about going and they LOVE Chuck E Cheese.  My youngest has been agitating to have her fifth birthday party there.  We've been trying to talk her out of that, but with no luck.  We are going to check out the prices to see if it's anything approaching reasonable.       GAS PRICES    I don't know about the rest of the country, but in California, the gas prices are going sky high.  Most of our gas stations (at least in our area) are charging a bit over $2.00 a gallon for unleaded!  I've been reading about the political unrest in Venezuela.  In one article they stated that because of that, the oil production of Venezuela was at 60% production.  I'd wager to guess this, along with all of the happenings of Iraq are driving the prices up.  Any thoughts?     FEEDBACK    I received this response from Ward in regards to my post on Iraq.  For once, we seem to be in agreement.    = = = = =   War in Iraq   = = = = =  The Big Thing about the coming war in Iraq is Saddam Hussein.  Hussein is a Hitler-wannabe.  MUCH better to deal with him now, before he has nukes.  I wish it were otherwise.  War is ALWAYS expensive.  It costs lives.  It costs treasure.  It costs friends who become adversaries, or enemies.  Ultimately, Iraq is the big loser here - all the young men Hussein has cost them in the wars from the 1980's onward will not be available to help rebuild the country.  The same thing has chewed up France and Germany - their best young men were killed off in WW1 and WW2, and they've been 2nd-class countries since 1945.  Stalin killed off Russia's best young men, starting in the 1930's, and Russia is now a 2nd-class power.  Very sad.  Just my thoughts.     Thanks for your thoughts.  I agree, it is sad.  But unless Hussein does an about face, I don't see any other way around it     Here are some more cubicle sayings!  Thanks Ward.  I'd forgotten some of these.    It's hard to soar with eagles when you're surrounded by turkeys.  Patience my ass!  Let's go out and kill something!  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  (Management NEVER follows this.  Never.  But, you knew that!)    Thanks for reminding me.  Yes, I remember that well.  I wonder if some times they lay awake a night thinking of ways to change things.  Don't they have anything better to do?     HUMOR   Thanks to my folks for sending this.  It's really cute!  =================  DEAR ANN LANDERS:      I loved the letters you printed about misinterpreting the Lord's Prayer. When my twin daughters were young, I taught them to say this prayer before going to bed.  As I listened outside their door, I could hear them say, "Give us this steak and daily bread, and forgive us our mattresses." My husband and I always had a good laugh over this. That was over 50 years ago, and the memory still remains in my heart.   From San Francisco: When I was a child, I learned this prayer as "Our Father, who are in Heaven, Howard be thy name." I always thought that was God's real name.   Groton, Mass: My mother spent her early childhood saying, "Hail Mary, full of grapes."   Missoula, Mont: My son, who is in nursery school, said, "Our Father, who art in Heaven, how didja know my name?"   Uniontown, Ohio: I remember thinking this prayer was "Give us this day our jelly bread."   Covina, Calif: I recall reading something years ago about the Pledge of Allegiance. Some child thought it began, "I led the pigeons to the flag."   Cleveland, Ohio: When I was little, I often wondered who Richard Stands was. You know: "I pledge allegiance to the flag . ..   and to the republic for Richard Stands."    Schenectady, NY: I once knew a child whose favorite Sunday school song was "Gladly, the Cross-Eyed Bear."   Tampa, Fla: When my husband was 6 years old, he thought a certain prayer was "He suffered under a bunch of violets." The real words were "under Pontius Pilate," but at that age, he didn't know better. To this day, we still snicker in church whenever that prayer is read.    Lake Forest Park, Wash: When I was a little girl, we sang a song in Sunday school about Noah. Part of the chorus was "And the rains came down, and the floods came up." We lived next door to a couple of charming little girls who always sang this song while playing in their garden. Their words were, "And the rains came down, and the spuds came up."   Oak Harbor, Wash: When my older brother was very young, he always walked up to the church altar with my mother when she took communion. On one occasion, he tugged at her arm and asked, "What does the priest say when he gives you the bread?" Mom whispered something in his ear. Imagine his shock many years later when he learned that the priest doesn't say, "Be quiet until you get to your seat."   Grand Junction, Colo: When I was younger, I believed the line was "Lead a snot into temptation."  I thought I was praying for my little sister to get into trouble      That's about it for now.  Feel free to drop me a line with your thoughts or anything you find humorous.  I'd love to hear from you!!!  Ciao4now!!!!

        OWNER TRAINING    Last night I took Tiny to her doggie obedience training.  It went really well.  The instructor said she is quite pleased with the progress we are making.  This is only her second session so we are still kind of new at it.  This session (each of them lasts six weeks) has been really good for Tiny as there are about 10 dogs in the class and it offers her plenty of distractions.  The first session only had 3 dogs, and it was easier to control her.  I've always thought of these classes as more of an owner training more than anything else.  It teaches us a lot of common sense things, and I also come away with a lot of good tips and ways to modify unacceptable behavior.  Tiny has turned out to be more of a "Mommy's" dog.  She's really great with the girls, which is a blessing.  All in all, I think she'll end up being a great dog.  The next step will be to get her into agility training.  I think she'll really do well at that.  We need to at least finish this session, and perhaps one more before we move on to that.  I'm looking forward to that.  I watched part of a class and it looked as though the dogs have a lot of fun negotiating their way through the obstacle courses.  On Tuesday nights, I take her to doggie socialization and she loves it.  She does really well with other dogs, and loves to play.  Makes for a busy week but I don't really mind it.    WEBSITE    I've added some pictures of the girls and their day at the park to the website.  Just go to the photo album and click on the folder entitled "The Girls."  I will eventually have the pictures as thumbnails, but I wanted to get them up first before the pictures became obsolete.  I have a lot of work left to do yet on it, but that's why I consider it more of a work in progress. I keep getting all of these ideas.  I think I need to start writing them down so I won't forget.  That's about all for now.  Hope you have a great day!

        AN AFTERNOON AT THE PARK    We had an uncharacteristically beautiful day here on Sunday so we decided to ignore the chores and errands we had to do and go ahead and play hooky.  We took the girls to the park right by our house.  We made a day of it by taking a picnic lunch.  We got some really good pictures that I hope to have posted up on the site in the next couple of days.  The city has recently revamped this park and now it has allot of state-of-the-art playground equipment.  One neat feature is the three humongous cement slides.  The kids   (and adults if they are brave enough or are suffering a severe case of lack of common sense)   can either slide down on cardboard or just by the seat of their pants.  I've not gotten up enough guts to do it yet, but somehow was talked into promising that the next time we went, I'd give it a whirl   (now where did I put that common sense?).    The slides are basically built for teens on down, and my main fear is that I would sit myself down on one of them, begin the decent, and get stuck   (Hey Mom!  Look at me!  No hands!).    Of course, being larger than a child may have its advantages   (providing you aren't large enough to get stuck)   as it could significantly decrease your speed.  Of course, if you are silly enough to wear anything with polyester, you may find that the friction causes the material in your pants to heat up and melt, so that when you get to the bottom of the slide, you have second-degree burns on your rump.  Imagine yourself explaining that one to your doctor.  If the updates to this journal cease to happen, you will know that I tried it and was rushed to the hospital and am now in traction being fed intravenously, while I have an ice pack settled on my, um, rump.  Don't laugh...  it COULD happen.        MONDAY BLUES    After having such a wonderful weekend, I found it extremely difficult to get out of my nice, warm bed this morning.  I was really irritated about being woken up from a wonderful dream which included being stranded on a tropical island with Mel Gibson, sand, surf.... well, you get the picture.  Needless to say, I had a long discussion, and countless arguments with myself, which I obviously lost because I went to work.  It's probably for the best.  The work would have still been there for me tomorrow, only there would be more added to it.  After arriving to work, I immediately confirmed my belief that Mondays bite.  Especially mornings.  Now, let me start off by saying that I'm not the brightest bulb in the box early in the morning, but Mondays are worse.  This particular one was bad as I had stayed up way too late the night before watching a Lethal Weapon movie   (maybe that's why I had that dream).    I did my normal planning of my day on the way in to work, and all of that was blown out of the water when I met my manager in the cafeteria right after I got in   (I was going for one of the extra large gourmet coffees to see if that would help clear the brain)    Turns out they had a bit of a panic (unanticipated costs on contracts), and decided to hold a meeting to see what and how we were going to handle things.  You know how that goes.  That was fine and all, it needed to be dealt with, but that just meant that my whole morning was blown.  I'd love to have a day with no phone calls, meetings or interruptions so that I have a chance to get a little bit caught up.  So it goes.....      IRAQ   	 I'm sure that you all have been listening to the unfolding story regarding Iraq.  My husband and I had a bit of a discussion about this.  In fact, I think he even wrote about it in one of his blogs.    I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on this topic.  Drop me a line on how you feel we should handle the situation.  Should we go to war?  Is Iraq cooperating with the weapons inspectors enough to justify NOT going to war?  What is your opinion and why?  Drop me a line and let me know what you think.  Surprisingly, my husband and I are in an agreement on this one.  We rarely are on cases such as these.  I really don't think there is any hope that we WON'T go to war, which is sad.  I'd rather deal with Sadam before he has access to nuclear weapons.  As for as the destruction of missiles...that's a laugh.  It's a farce to get the public to believe they have 100% coooperation.   Ok, Iraq began destroying its Al Samoud 2 missiles on Saturday.  France and Germany believe that this is proof that the inspections are working (w00t, what drug are they on and can I have some?)  Thing is, Baghdad has yet to account for missing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons.  It's got to be all or nothing.  That's JMO.   Sadam is a sick one.  The sooner we do something about it, the better.      A LITTLE HUMOR    Thought some of you might find this a little humorous.  Enjoy!   Inspirational Posters For The Cubicle Era   Rome did not create a great empire by having meetings, they did it by killing all those who opposed them.   If you can stay calm, while all around you is chaos...then you probably haven't completely understood the seriousness of the situation.   Doing a job RIGHT the first time gets the job done. Doing the job WRONG fourteen times gives you job security.   Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.   Artificial Intelligence is no match for Natural Stupidity   A person who smiles in the face of adversity...probably has a scapegoat.   Plagiarism saves time.   If at first you don't succeed, try management.   Never put off until tomorrow what you can avoid altogether.   TEAMWORK...means never having to take all the blame yourself.   The beatings will continue until morale improves.   Never underestimate the power of very stupid people in large groups.   We waste time, so you don't have to.   Hang in there, retirement is only thirty years away!   Go the extra mile. It makes your boss look like an incompetent slacker.   A snooze button is a poor substitute for no alarm clock at all.   When the going gets tough, the tough take a coffee break.   INDECISION is the key to FLEXIBILITY.   Succeed in spite of management.   Aim Low, Reach Your Goals, Avoid Disappointment.    That's about it for right now!  Ciao for now!

        JOBS AND STAY AT HOME DADS    The job is going well.  For the most part, I still enjoy it, though I wish there would be a little less of it at the moment.  I just received four new contracts that I'm going to be in charge of, and they are unique in that they are handled quite differently than what I'm used to.  While I enjoy learning new things, I really hate going through it because it causes me a great deal of stress.  These particular contracts require charts up the gazoo.  I have never seen so many.  Not being familiar with them is really bogging me down.  I know it will come with time, but I'm always afraid I'm going to mess something up.  So it goes....  My husband is still out of work, and has been for the better part of a year, not counting the four months that he worked as a contractor.  Unemployment is high out here and there is just no action.  He's been sending out allot of resumes, but rarely gets any kind of a response.  He's and IT guru and those folks were hit really hard with the dot com implosion.  He's been staying at home with my youngest daughter and that saves quite a bit on daycare.  She does go once or twice a week, so that she can have some fun with other kids, and dad has a chance to maintain his sanity.  He also drops off and picks up my eldest from school, which saves us a bundle on before and after care.  In some ways, it has been good because he's formed a closer bond with the girls.  It will be nice when we can get the extra income back though.  It's been tight only having unemployment coming in but we are managing.  That's about all for the moment.  Need to go get cleaned up.  It's a beautiful day outside and I think the park is calling us!    Ciao for now!  Be good, and if you can't, have fun!

        THE KIDS    The girls are both doing great, though I do wonder from time to time if they will live to see their next birthday.  My eldest is 8 and in third grade.  I can't believe the things they are learning in third grade.  She's already doing things like division.  She has a science fair on March 27th that is mandatory.  She definitely has her work cut out for her.  They could pick what they wanted to do, based on some strict guidelines.  She is going to base hers on all of the planets and discuss whether or not she feels that there could be life on them.  We are helping her work out the details of how she wants to do that.  It's going to be a lot of work but a lot of fun as well.  My youngest will be 5 on March 31st, which really amazes me.  I remember quite clearly when she was a baby and just learning to crawl.  Time goes by so fast.  She's still my strong willed, independent one.  I often tell people that if I would have had her first, I would have stopped there.  The tantrums are a lot less now but we are working with her to control her temper.  She has a problem with the word "no."  If you use it, you'd best have full-bodied armor on to protect yourself.

        CATCHING UP    Well, it's been a long time since I've posted anything.  Guess I could give the excuse of being busy and all.  Well, I guess you could say I have been busy but I've also lacked the motivation to write.  I've completed school and have my Bachelors in Business Management.  It was a long, tough road, and one I really never thought I would finish.  I graduated with a 3.9 and that gives me a serious feeling of pride.  Now, if I ever see another text book again, you'll have to call the men in the white coats to come and take me back to the little padded room with my name on it.  I'm starting up a website now that I have a little free time   (is there such a thing when you have kids?)    I'm not sure of the direction it's going to take or where it will go but at least I'm off to a fairly good start.  I have found that it is really fun putting stuff like this together, but I'm afraid if I keep this up, I may lose all my hair, and what little is left will turn gray.  Of course, one could argue that I have no hair left the way it is because I have a couple of young things who have made it their life's mission to drive me over the brink.  That being said, I can tell you that I have learned quite a bit about HTML but need to learn so much more.  Take color matching for instance.  Whew!  Be thankful you weren't here when I first started testing some of the colors out for the background and such.  I came up with some doozies.  Some of them looked like something you would find in the bottom of a baby's diaper   (to coin a phrase from my dad)   or they would make you lunge for you sunglasses to protect your eyes from the glare.  A friend of mine was kind enough to send me a link that made this part much less traumatic for me.  This of course, was after I had struggled with it for a bit, but I was still eternally grateful.  At any rate, I hope you'll check my site out and drop me a line to tell me what you think.  I would appreciate any ideas, or comments you might have.  I'm really new at this so I need all the help I can get.   HERE

        SUNDAY MORNING    It's a beautiful, sunny day here.  We are all having a lazy Sunday morning.  It's nice to not have to rush around and do the get ready for work/school routine.  I'm trying not to think about work and what is waiting for me there, and most of the time I'm successful.  I've got a big presentation to give on some contracts that I only picked up less than a month ago.  I really don't know much about them, so getting ready for it takes up a large amount of my time, which I really don't have allot of lately.  Of course, no one has much time nowadays, and they just keep piling the work on.  Management's attitude comes through as  "you might as well get used to it because it's only going to get worse."   It's tough on the morale of all of the employees because it makes us feel as if management doesn't care and isn't on our side.  Oh well, beats the alternative.    DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT?    So it goes........      THE BIRTHDAY PARTY    All in all, I'd have to say that the birthday party at Chuck E Cheese was not all that bad.  The girls had a really good time.  They ate pizza until it was coming out of their ears, and had cake to top it all off.  The busied themselves by playing games and climbing through all of the tubes, with mom desperately trying to keep track of them both at one time.  My ears stopped wringing  (caused by the noise level)  by about 4:30 or so.  Kids are wonderful, but I like them best in small numbers.       WEBSITE WORK    I've been working a bit on my site.  I added a forum to it called The Break Room.  I tried to tie the colors in with the rest of my site.  As I learn more, it's my hope to add more features to it.  For right now, it's just a place to post on various topics.  You can visit it here:   The Break Room   Feel free to jump right in.      A MOUSE IN THE HOUSE         submitted by M & D   A mouse looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package; what food might it contain?  He was aghast to discover that it was a mousetrap!  Retreating to the farmyard, the mouse proclaimed the warning, "There is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house."   The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, "Mr. Mouse, I can tell you this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me; I cannot be bothered by it."  The mouse turned to the pig and told him, "There is a mouse trap in the house."  "I am so very sorry Mr. Mouse," sympathized the pig, "but there is nothing I can think of to do about it.  Surely someone else will step in to help."  The mouse turned to the cow, who replied, "Like wow, Mr. Mouse, a mouse trap; am I in grave danger, Duh?"  So the mouse returned to the house, head down and dejected to face the farmer's mousetrap alone.  That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a mousetrap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught.  In the darkness, she did not see that it was a venomous snake whose tail the trap had caught.  The snake bit the farmer's wife.  The farmer rushed her to the hospital.  She returned home with a fever. Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard for the soup's main ingredient.  His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer butchered the pig.   The farmer's wife did not get well, in fact, she died, and so many people came for her funeral the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide meat for all of them to eat.  So the next time you hear that someone is facing a problem and think that it does not concern you, remember that when the least of us is threatened, we are all at risk.  And so it may be with Germany, France and Belgium one day.    That's it for now!  Ciao!

        YAS OR YET ANOTHER SUNDAY    It's been a week since I've posted.  Seems I can't quite find the time or the energy to write these days.  The entire week is a blur to me.  I ended up going into work today.  I just was too worked up with the amount of things I have to do.  As they say, so many projects, so little time.  As the years pass, and my knowledge base broadens, management relies on me to handle more things.  I know I shouldn't be complaining.  I'm lucky to have a job.  I just wish they wouldn't rely on me so much.  I keep being told by my friends and co-workers that I need to learn how to say no.  Most likely my inability to say no, or to even ask for help comes from a product of the environment in which I was brought up.  Both my father and mother passed down their superlative work ethics to their children.  You do whatever it takes to get the job done, and done right.  By the way, I think this is a good thing.    Because my mind hosts this attitude, my health suffers.  As the stress level increases, my body begins to betray me.  I'm yet again wrestling with high blood pressure issues for which I need to go back to the doctor for.  My stomach is once again waking up and I am battling insomnia because my mind is running around like a hamster in a wheel, racing to try to meet all the deadlines and wondering how in the world I will accomplish it.  I woke up Friday morning and one side of my left arm, as well as the side of my right hand, pinky and wring fingers are somewhat numb.  I suspect it's due to a pinched nerve.   I must have slept wrong.  The only problem is, when I use that hand or arm excessively, they ache and tingle and the same time.  They also tend to get number for a while.  If it doesn't clear up I'll have to see a doctor about it.  It's been harder and harder to get up in the mornings.  I just am running out of motivation.  My house is a wreck, and I simply am having a hard time caring.  I just don't have the energy.    My husband is still out of work.  There is really nothing out there.  He is applying for everything that seems remotely related to his experience and has gotten very little bites.  My insecurities kick in, and I wonder if we will make it.  Some days I'm full of optimism, but mostly, I worry incessantly.  How will we pay the bills?  Will we have to sell our house?  I know these are common worries and I am thankful for the unemployment we receive.  That is probably one of the reasons I'm so hell bent on becoming irriplacable at work.  I need to do everything I can to ensure I don't lose my job.  I'm in a black hole.  Down at the bottom.  It echoes in here.  Just when the sides of the hole begging to crumble and collapse upon me, a hand always seems to reach in, take a hold of me and pull me out.  I am waiting for that hand now.      IRAQ    I'm sure you all are keeping track of the news about Iraq and the probable war that looms ahead of us.  I received a couple of very good emails.  One was written by Dennis Miller, offering another point of view.  Even if you don't agree with all of the things he has to say, he makes some good observations.    TRYING TO HELP -  by DENNIS MILLER  ALL THE RHETORIC ON WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAQ HAS GOT MY INSANE LITTLE BRAIN SPINNING LIKE A ROULETTE WHEEL. I ENJOY READING OPINIONS FROM BOTH SIDES BUT I HAVE DETECTED A HINT OF CONFUSION FROM SOME OF YOU.  AS I WAS READING THE PAPER RECENTLY, I WAS REMINDED OF THE BEST ADVICE SOMEONE EVER GAVE ME. HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE KISS METHOD (KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID!) SO, WITH THIS AS A THEME, I'D LIKE TO APPLY THIS THEORY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T QUITE GET IT. MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN SIMPLIFY THINGS A BIT AND RECOGNIZE A FEW IMPORTANT FACTS.  HERE ARE 10 THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN VOICING AN OPINION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE:  1) BETWEEN PRESIDENT BUSH AND SADDAM HUSSEIN ... HUSSEIN IS THE BAD GUY.  2) IF YOU HAVE FAITH IN THE UNITED NATIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING KEEP THIS IN MIND, THEY HAVE LIBYA HEADING THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND IRAQ HEADING THE GLOBAL DISARMAMENT COMMITTEE. DO YOUR OWN MATH HERE  3) IF YOU USE GOOGLE SEARCH AND TYPE IN "FRENCH MILITARY VICTORIES," YOUR REPLY WILL BE "DID YOU MEAN FRENCH MILITARY DEFEATS?"  4) IF YOUR ONLY ANTI-WAR SLOGAN IS "NO WAR FOR OIL," SUE YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR ALLOWING YOU TO SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS AND ROBBING YOU OF THE EDUCATION YOU DESERVE.  5) SADDAM AND BIN LADEN WILL NOT SEEK UNITED NATIONS APPROVAL BEFORE THEY TRY TO KILL US.  6) DESPITE COMMON BELIEF, MARTIN SHEEN IS NOT THE PRESIDENT. HE PLAYS ONE ON T.V.  7) EVEN IF YOU ARE ANTI-WAR, YOU ARE STILL AN "INFIDEL!" AND BIN LADEN WANTS YOU DEAD, TOO.  8) IF YOU BELIEVE IN A "VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY" BUT NOT IN THE DANGER THAT HUSSEIN POSES, QUIT HANGING OUT WITH THE DELL COMPUTER DUDE.  9) WE ARE NOT TRYING TO LIBERATE THEM.  10) WHETHER YOU ARE FOR MILITARY ACTION OR AGAINST IT, OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OVERSEAS ARE FIGHTING FOR US TO DEFEND OUR RIGHT TO SPEAK OUT. WE ALL NEED TO SUPPORT THEM WITHOUT RESERVATION.  I HOPE THIS HELPS.    In yet another email I received the transcripts from a speech given by Alabama State Auditor, Beth Chapman.  This speech was given at the "Stand Up for America Rally.  It is said that her speech resulted in five standing ovations, tremendous applause, and an encore.  What do you think?  Do you agree with her?    Stand Up for America Rally Speech By: Beth Chapman   I'm here tonight because men and women of the United States military have given their lives for my freedom.    I am not here tonight because Sheryl Crowe, Rosie O'Donnell, Martin Sheen, George Clooney, Jane Fonda or Phil Donahue, sacrificed their lives for me.   If my memory serves me correctly, it was not movie stars or musicians, but the United States Military who fought on the shores of Iwo Jima, the jungles of Vietnam, and the beaches of Normandy.   Tonight, I say we should support the President of the United States and the U.S. Military and tell the liberal, tree-hugging, Birkenstock-wearing, hippie, tie-dyed liberals to go make their movies and music and whine somewhere else.   After all, if they lived in Iraq, they wouldn't be allowed the freedom of speech they're being given here today. Ironically, they would be put to death at the hands of Sadam Husssein or Osama Bin Laden.   I want to know how the very people who are against war because of the loss of life, can possibly be the same people who are for abortion?   They are the same people who are for animal rights but against the rights of the unborn.   The movie stars say they want to go to Iraq and serve as "human shields" for the Iraqis. I say let them buy a one-way ticket and go.   No one likes war. I hate war! But the one thing I hate more is the fact that this country has been forced into war--innocent people have lost their lives - - and there but for the grace of God, it could have been my brother, my husband, or even worse, my own son.   On December 7, 1941, there are no records of movie stars treading the blazing waters of Pearl Harbor.   On September 11, 2001, there are no photos of movie stars standing as "human shields" against the debris and falling bodies ascending from the World Trade Center. There were only policemen and firemen - underpaid civil servants who gave their all with nothing expected in return.   When the USS Cole was bombed, there were no movie stars guarding the ship -- where were the human shields then?   If America's movie stars want to be human shields, let them shield the gang-ridden streets of Los Angeles, or New York City, let them shield the lives of the children of North Birmingham whose mothers put them down to sleep on the floor each night to shelter them from stray bullets.   If they want to be human shields, I say let them shield the men and women of honesty and integrity that epitomize courage and embody the spirit of freedom by wearing the proud uniforms of the United States Military. Those are the people who have earned and deserve shielding!   Throughout the course of history, this country has remained free, not because of movie stars and liberal activists, but because of brave men and women who hated war too. However, they lay down their lives so that we all may live in freedom. After all - "Greater love hath no man, than that he lay down his life for his friend," or in this case a country.   We should give our military honor and acknowledgement and not let their lives be in vain. If you want to see true human shields, walk through Arlington Cemetery.  There lie human shields, heroes, and the BRAVE Americans who didn't get on television and talk about being a human shield - they were human shields.   I thank God tonight for freedom - - those who bought and paid for it with their lives in the past - - those who will protect it in the present and defend it in the future.   America has remained silent too long! God-fearing people have remained silent too long!   We must lift our voices united in a humble prayer to God for guidance and the strength and courage to sustain us throughout whatever the future may hold.   After the tragic events of Sept. 11th, my then eleven-year-old son said terrorism is a war between them and us and if you're not one of us, then you're one of them.   So in closing tonight, let us be of one accord, let us stand proud, and let us be the human shields of prayer, encouragement and support for the President, our troops and their families, and our country.   May God bless America, the land of the free, the home of the brave and the greatest country on the face of this earth!      FINAL THOUGHT    If you have gotten this far, bless you.  I’ll take my leave now.  I must find some cheese to go with my wine.  Ciao!

       MISCELLANEOUS TIDBITS   The girls are doing wonderfully, as always.  I must admit to wanting to be in another state this weekend.  They did alot of fighting all the way through. Sometimes it's like that.  I feel very blessed that this type of behavior, for extended periods of time, is quite unusual.  It has to make you wonder if they feel the stress in the adults around them during the war, and this is one of their ways of dealing with it.  I'm mostly over analyzing I'm sure, but I think as parents we tend to do this when our children exhibit behavior that is out of the norm.  I couldn't resist posting some really cute pictures of them.

      I'm on the Diversity Council this year at work and I must say, we've done some interesting things.  I've learned quite a bit during the process.  The leader of the council sends out weekly diversity messages, many of them quite thought provoking. With all of the unrest and uncertainty due to the war, I thought this particular one was appropriate.      War Challenges Our Ability to Maintain “Business As Usual.”    Once again, the mood of the country has been affected by world events as war with Iraq has begun. Many of us are confused. We wonder. We worry. And we watch. While in our offices, hospitals, schools, and factories, there is an attempt to keep a sense of normalcy, however, tension may be affecting behaviors. Employees may be edgy, troubled, and confused as they deal with their anxiety. Some may be concerned about their personal safety or the security of America. Others could be thinking about our soldiers in battle or the people of Iraq. And, in the midst of this, there may be heated conversations between people with opposing views about why we are at war or pointed comments about the “good guys” and the “bad.” All this means that our lives have changed and “business as usual’ is more difficult to maintain. As people feel a loss of control they can become distracted, unmotivated, and, ultimately, unproductive. Helping individuals deal with this anxiety will help lessen the tension, provide support for them at this time of uncertainty about the days ahead, and keep the wheels of our businesses rolling. Here are a few suggestions of things that might help lessen the tension and provide support.    Acknowledge Wartime Anxiety    World events in the days and weeks ahead are likely to be stressful. This is the time for compassionate managers to acknowledge that people may feel troubled. The Media will be showing graphic photos of events far away, while at home, we hear of orange alerts and heightened security. The range of reactions will vary depending on people’s feelings about this conflict and their beliefs about this war. Some may exhibit little to no change in emotion or behavior. Others may react to the distractions with symptoms of anxiety including reduced concentration, heightened irritability or sensitivity, and physical maladies-all of these make work difficult. Allow people the space they need and acknowledge the emotional stress they may be feeling. For those who seem to be distracted, a few minutes spent in letting them express their thoughts and feelings will allow the focus to shift to the work at hand. Without investing this time, pent up emotions may heighten symptoms. For many people, work will be the “safe haven” where they can turn their attention to something they know and can control.     Provide Safety Information    One of the major concerns everyone has is about their own personal safety and the safety of their families. One way to reduce anxiety is to provide as much information as you can about safety. Inform your employees of what the company will do in case of a disaster or chemical emergency. Providing concrete information and steps to follow will reduce anxiety about what might happen. If there are activities related to safety in the community, it would be helpful to make this information available.     Maintain a Normal Routine, But Be Flexible    The uncertainty of each day will be eased if individuals know that they can do something about their concerns. Some may find relief checking in with their children. Some may seek travel alternatives to avoid flying. Employees may request paid time off to attend prayer services or to take a mental health break. Other may request a change in their schedule to partake in stress relieving activities such as fitness classes or workout programs. While this may cause minimal disruption in workflow, any supportive gesture will mean a great deal. Although sensitive to these accommodations, most people will expect normal activities will occur. Encourage people to do good work, continue to enjoy each other at work, laugh, and socialize.     Maintain the Message of Respect    While there will be many perspectives on the current events, this is a time to be hypersensitive to maintaining respectful behavior. Just as the issues following 9/11 encouraged us to build bridges of understanding, wartime tension requires us to keep the message of Appreciation in front of everyone. Not only must this message be audible and visible, it must be enforced. Workplaces will be tested during this time to see if the messages of respect and dignity are truly embedded in the culture. People of different races, nationalities, religions, life experiences, and opinions come together at work. We are all one in the discomfort of war. Seize the opportunity to have conversations that promote learning, listening, and unity.     Infuse Conversations with Humanity    There is a plethora of media out there on this world conflict. Military jargon, battle decries, casualty numbers, frightening language, and disturbing images will plague us. Now more than ever, people need to hear words that are comforting. Work to infuse conversations with words of compassion, empathy, understanding, and healing. Hope is the best antidote for anxiety.   United Now More Than Ever From:  ProGroup, Inc.

       DOES MANAGEMENT LACK THE HUMAN TOUCH?   I have found that I have been asking myself that question lately.  We had an All-Hands staff meeting last week and the guest speaker was our new functional manager.  In other words, one of the big bosses.  I came away from that meeting with a bad feeling.  She was very negative in general, and didn't have many good things to say about our operation here.  One of her top priorities is to get a valid EVM (Earned Value Management) system into place because of some problems that occurred during an audit. When an employee asked her why it was allowed to get this way, she replied that she didn't know and it wasn't on her watch anyway  (nuff said)     My unpleasant feeling only intensified as the meeting progressed.  During the course of an hour, he did alot of posturing.  "I" set this up, "I" came up with the idea and impletemented it, etc.  When a manager exhibits this type of behavior, it really bothers me.  You know very well she had a team of people doing the work and backing her up.  I am fortunate that the lower level managers, supervisors and leads (the one's I work for at least) are not like that.  For me personnally, it makes me feel as if we are part of a whole team when credit is given where it is deserved.  It helps employees feel as though they are significantly contributing and are valued.   We are moving towards a "One Company" approach, and the road has been very rocky.  The morale of the employees is at an all time low, due to past lay-offs and rumors of future one's.  Add that to the increasing workload and it is the recipe for stress and unhappiness on the job.  What excaberates it is that management has copped the attitude that  "change happens, there's going to be more of it, and it's only going to get worse."   What happened to the human touch?  What happened to showing (or at least acting) like you really understood and cared about the impact all of this was going to have on your employees.  I ask you management types out there.  Does becoming a Manager automatically obliterate all "human" feeling so that you become detatched from the very workforce that supports you?  Do you make all of your decisions based soley on what is for the good of the company and not worry about your employees?  If so, I'm not so sure I'd want to be a part of that.  Don't get me wrong.  These changes being implemented are, for the most part, likely valid and will enable us to improve the way we do business.  What I'm questioning is how the ideas are presented to the population, as well as the fact that no one goes to the worker in order to measure the impact that these changes will have.  So it goes......

       MORE PICTURES!   Finally got the rest of the  urlLink pictures  posted up in my album for my youngest's fifth birthday.  We have some really good ones there.  You can tell that everyone really had a good time, especially the birthday girl.  I loved making a cake.  It was alot of work but when I saw her face, it was totally worth it.  It is so hard to comprehend that she is five now and will be going to  Kindergarten  next year.  It seems only yesterday she was a baby.   DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME   I love the extra daylight at the end of the day but losing that hour is getting harder on me as I get older.  I am so sleepy this morning.  To top it all off, I carpool and the we had to drop of the husband of the lady I ride in with at the airport so we had to leave a little earlier.  This is not a problem, and I don't mind doing it in the least, but oiy, I was having a hard enough time coping with losing that hour, much less getting up ealier.  I should have brought my pillow in.  That's about it for now.  If you haven't already been to my  urlLink guestbook  make sure you drop by and sign it.  Thanks, and have a great day everyone!!!!!

       MORE ADDED TO SITE   Well, I've added my husband's  resume  to my site.  That was interesting.  Take a look at it and let me know what you think.  I'll probably modify the format after a bit but I've had enough html this morning to last me a while.     LAZY SUNDAY   We are having a lazy Sunday today.  I really do need to get this old bod in gear and hop into the shower and start doing some work around the house.  We acquired some items from my brother, such as a very large bookcase and some plant stands.  I need to do some major reorganizing to make things look right.  This means, emptying an existing bookcase of encyclopedias, clearing away the toys, moving new bookcase to to where toys were, moving old bookcase to new location and then figuring out what the heck I'm going to do with the toys.  Sigh..I guess this would be a good time to go through all of the toys and get rid of some of them.  But don't tell the girls I said that.

        WE'RE BACK!    We went on vacation up north during spring break and had a really great time.  My lovely sister-in-law and her family, leant us their trailer up in Oregon and it is situated right next to (read that on) the beach.  Oh my!  It was heavenly.  The trailer is very small but very home like.  The size didn't really matter.  We were outdoors on the beach for a better part of the time any way.  On rainly days, my sister-in-law had made us a list of activities to do.  I think we hit them all.  We went to a tour of the Tillamook Cheese Factory which was wonderful.  We got to see how they made, sliced and packaged the cheese and then got to try some samples.  Mmmmmm.  On another day, we went to the Pioneer Museum which was fascinating.  They had alot of old things to look at.  My 5 year old is kind of wasted on museums so far.  We came, we saw, let's go.  :)  Next we went and visited Air Museum which had just about every plane you could think of, including some of those that were really old.  We took a bunch of pictures so I'll add some of them here at a later date.  When we arrived, my sister-in-law had taken some plastic eggs and filled them up with tiny seashells and planted them all around the trailer.  The kids had a blast finding them.  She also gave them each a stuffed Easter Bunny and some Easter pencils.  What a treat for the girls!  It was nice as we had arrived there on Easter so we hadn't done our normal Easter celebration with the kids.  Later on that evening, my husband and I did the "Easter" thing for the girls in the trailer.  I hid the stuff while he went and played on the beach with the girls for a while.  Turned out great and the girls are convinced that I called the Easter Bunny to come to the trailer in the evening because we wouldn't be home.    I'll write more later about the rest of our trip.  Right now...I'm ready to hit the sack.  :)  Take care all...ciao4now!

       BEEN A LONG TIME   Seems like RL has taken a front seat nowadays.  Work is really busy and now that the kids are home from school, there are lots of activities to attend.  We've just finished an audit at work that kept me incredibly busy and insane.  Thankfully, we passed with no findings but needless to say, I was exhausted (as all of us in my group were) after it was over.  Life is always filled with changes and your ability to deal with them is what makes you who you are.  My husband has been out of work for quite some time and we are now looking at possibly moving to another state where the cost of living (particularly housing) is not as high.  My company has a presence in many areas in the US and I've been tracking the openings.  The thought of moving my family, lock, stock and barrel scares me to death, but I need to consider what would be best for them.  I've got a possiblity in Georgia, but we will have to see if that works out.  Obviously, that would be a nice place to go as it would bring me closer to my family.  With only one income to live on, I haven't been able to visit like I want to.   DO-NOT-CALL LIST     Hundreds of thousands sign on for 'do-not-call' registry        (CNN) -- The federal government Friday launched a national "do-not-call" registry aimed at stopping most telemarketing phone calls to people who regard the sales pitches as invasive and want them blocked.       Here is the article in  urlLink  full  .  I think this is something that is WAYYYYYYYYY overdue.  Will any of you be signing up for this service?  Do you feel that telemarketers have the right to make calls?  Are those of you who live outside the US plagued by telemarketers.      A Bandwidth Drought Is Coming, And U.S. Phone Companies and ISPs Have No Idea What To Do About It        Given that there are something like 60 million U.S. homes on the Internet and fewer than 20 million of those have broadband connections, you might think I am a bit premature in my complaining about a lack of bandwidth. After all, compared with two-thirds of Americans on the Net, I have plenty of bandwidth, tons of it. But my complaint isn't so much with the amount of bandwidth any of us have, but with the amount that is available. I fear we are falling behind the bandwidth curve and this is going to severely limit the potential of the Internet.      Here is a link to the  urlLink  article  .   Glass Houses Department   Fox news is reporting  urlLink HERE  about the Affirmative Action case decided by the Supremes. Dick Gephardt, Candidate for Prez, had this to say about the Supreme Court:      "When I'm president, we'll do executive orders to overcome any wrong thing the Supreme Court does tomorrow or any other day," Gephardt said.      I guess he wants to be Supreme Dictator, or something (a quot from my husband).   Gephardt really said that!   That's about it for now.  I'm going to try to be around a bit more now.  Happy blogging!!    Got any thoughts?

       FIREWORKS   All I can say is WOW!  That had to be one of the best shows we have seen in a long time.  We went downtown to watch the fireworks and it was well worth it!  We were going to take the train down, but it was jam packed.  A security guard told us that the busses were offering a special deal to try to draw people away from the trains.  We took the bus and got there in no time.  We found a good spot after walking a few blocks and plopped ourselves down on our blanket and proceeded to wait for the show to begin.  I'd have to say that the only other one we have seen that was better was the one time we went to Crescent City over the holiday and were camping.  They shot the fireworks off from a barge.  That was a really good show as well.  Getting home was a little bit more difficult, but not as bad as it could have been.  By the time we got to our car, and then pulled up in our garage, both the girls were bushed.  We all had a great time.  The whole day ended up being really great.  We live in a townhouse and our complex threw a 4th of July pool party, complete with chicken on skewers, hot dogs, beans chips, popsicles and sodas/water.  We all had a really good time.  The girls and I spent alot of time in the pool and our youngest is just starting to get the hang of swimming..sort of.  I think I got a bit too much sun as I'm a little red around the edges but I don't think that it will be that bad.    All in all, the day was wonderful and I'm ready to head on off to bed.    TTFN!

            THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE   Action of Second Continental Congress, July 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America  WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.  WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness -- That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The History of the present King of Great- Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.  HE has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public Good.  HE has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance, unless suspended in their Operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  HE has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of large Districts of People, unless those People would relinquish the Right of Representation in the Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only.  HE has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the Depository of their public Records, for the sole Purpose of fatiguing them into Compliance with his Measures.  HE has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly Firmness his Invasions on the Rights of the People.  HE has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of the Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the Dangers of Invasion from without, and the Convulsions within.  HE has endeavoured to prevent the Population of these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  HE has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.  HE has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.  HE has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harrass our People, and eat out their Substance.  HE has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislatures.  HE has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.  HE has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  FOR quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us;  FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  FOR cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:  FOR imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:  FOR transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences:  FOR abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the same absolute Rules into these Colonies:  FOR taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  FOR suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever.  HE has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  HE has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our Towns, and destroyed the Lives of our People.  HE is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the Works of Death, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized Nation.  HE has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the Executioners of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  HE has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.  IN every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury. A Prince, whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People.  NOR have we been wanting in Attentions to our British Brethren. We have warned them from Time to Time of Attempts by their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement here. We have appealed to their native Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our Connections and Correspondence. They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of Consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.  WE, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED STATED OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly Publish and Declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political Connection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.        WASHINGTON &#8212; The government and private technology experts warned Wednesday that hackers plan to attack thousands of Web sites Sunday in a loosely coordinated "contest" that could disrupt Internet traffic.         "The FBI is taking this very seriously," FBI  spokesman Bill Murray said. "Hacking is a crime and those who participate in this activity will be investigated and brought to justice."

       THREE DAY WEEKEND   Happy 4th of July!   Well, it's the day before but I thought I'd get a head start .  Three day weekend here I come!  I cannot believe that half the year is gone already.  It's unreal!  How many shopping days are left before Christmas?  I've been getting the itch again, and implementing some changes over on my website.  I've got a new banner, courtesy of my friend JT.  If you take a look at my  urlLink  Forums   you can see that I've added another theme, as well as logo (agan, thank you JT for the logo).  The new theme is space oriented, and I've kept the original theme as well.  Just log in (hint: register) and go to your profile and check out the new styles.  I think you'll be pleased.  I've also added the Amber Alert ticker, which will keep you up to date on the current Amber Alerts.  I'm currently developing a "links" page, which will enable me to add links to all of my friends websites, as well as others that request it.  Look for that to be happening in the next week or so.  I'm sure that I'll think of more things as time goes on.     WORK WEEK   Oiy Veh!  I hate month end.  I have more reports to do than I care to think about.  I've got five different sets of charts to do, the smallest of which is fourteen pages in length.  Plus, I had two quarterly reports to finish (contractual requirement) and send off to the customer.  But hey, it beats the alternative.   Do you want fries with that?   All in all, work is good.  I totally rearranged my office last week, and the results are awesome.  Everything is so much more convenient and I have more space.  It's amazing what something like that can do.    That's about it for now.  Thanks for stopping by!!

       SUNDAY AFTERNOON   Well, after a lazy morning, we went and got some lunch over at the local Wendy's.  After that, we stopped by the local grocery store to pick up some odds and ends.  Since we got back, the girls have been busy playing downstairs, not really wanting to go outside which is really unusual for them, but a nice break for Mom.    In a few minutes I'm going to round them up for a good swim at the pool.  The weather is perfect for it, just in the mid 80's or so.  Much better than the 100+ degree weather we have been having for the last few days.  I've been pleasantly suprised as to the number of hits I'm getting on my website and all of it's features.  I've got a wonderful friend who has been telling everyone about the site.  I'm going to soon be adding some extra links on my site to those who have put mine on theirs.  Thanks for stopping by!

       SUNDAY MORNING MUSINGS   To clean house, or not to clean house.  That is the question.  It looks as though we are going to have another beautiful day (albeit hot) here, and I can't decide if I want to waste it indoors doing stuff around the house.  Sundays are lazy days here, which is just fine with me.  Most likely, we will spend the day at the pool, just lounging around and letting the kids wear themselves out.    REVAMPING WEBSITE AND FORUMS  I'm in the midst of some more changes on my website and forums.  I've also added some more pictures to the photo gallery.  Take a look and tell me what you  urlLink think.   Don't forget to sign my guestbook!  Take a look at the  urlLink forums  as well.  I've added another them, SpacePilot3K.  I've also kept the subSilver theme as well so you can have a choice.  I'm currently working on getting a new logo in place for the SpacePilot3K theme.  I would appreciate any inputs you may have.  Don't forget to register and visit often.  That's about all I have for now.  Time to start my day.

       TUESDAY EVENING   Needless to say, things were really quiet today at work.  All of us were still somewhat in shock over the events that took place in Mississippi.  You see, even though we are a large corporation, we are still a tight group.  When a family member suffers, we suffer.  My mind keeps wandering back to the family members of all of the victims.  I think about the horror the employees must have gone through, and the horror that they will relive for the rest of their lives.  I think about the victims who were murdered or injured.  What is it that one thinks of when a gun is pointed at them?  Mom, I love you?  Dan, I didn't mean to argue with you this morning?  Please, let my children know I always loved them?  What in God's name makes a person go off the deep end like that?  Of course, the media is jumping at describing the man as racist, etc...and the bodies aren't even cold yet.  It's kind of hard to know just what to believe.  How can someone possess that much hatred, enough to go on a killing spree such as the one this morning?  What was going through his mind at the time?  Were there warnings at work that showed this man was close to going off the edge?  If so, why wasn't anything done about it?  I would imagne we'll never know what caused it.  Those things died with him, when he pointed the gun at himself and took his own life.  I'm glad I don't understand.  That means I'm not like him.       A LOOK AT MONDAY   I came into work on Monday, only to find that I had a computer that could access only the things that were located on my hard drive.  Wonderful, just wonderful.  Seems a router when down.  And then they had to go get a part.  And then..........they finally got it up and running (let me just say that I was not the only one affected) ten minutes before I was set to go home for the day.  Wonderful, just wonderful (did I say that already)?  I know parts are parts and they will break, but, please not on my time.  I couldn't even print.  I couldn't pull data.  I did what I could (of course, my filing was, for once, up to date) and then just kind of cleaned out my desk, rearranged my drawers, made up new binders and folders.  You know the kind of day that I'm talking about.  So it goes.....     A MOMENT OF SILENCE   I was just getting home tonight, when I saw my husband and the two terrorrists heading out for the pool.  They asked me if I wanted to go but I politely declined.  The idea of a couple of hours of no noise was too good to pass up.  Just me and the dog hanging out.  AND, to top it all off, I'm not even going to have to cook dinner tonight.  My husband is making his famous, never-the-same-way-twice-running spaghetti.  Life is good, yes?     SPEAKING OF THE DOG   She's wonderful, as usual.  She seems to be fully housebroken now (though you didn't hear me say that), and is really doing well.  Her chewing things has slowed down a little bit, but not as much as I would like.  Nothing is safe on the floor.  She is still an excellent escape artist, but I'm working on it.  We are settling down in a routine, and she is really becoming one of the family.  For a while there..I was beginning to wonder.  Oh, did I mention I think she was dropped on her head at birth?  She stalks, and tries to eat, all insects.  It's kind of interesting to watch.......  Here's a picutre.    And a  urlLink link  for some more.     CLOSING THE REMARKS   The terrorrists have arrived and it's time I bounce back into reality.  Hope you all have a wonderful evening and stop back again soon.

       Six Dead in Mississippi Factory Shooting        This one hits too close to home for me.  This is one of our facilities.  Even though they work on a different program, we all feel like the killed and injured were part of our family.  It really makes you stop and think.      (CNN) -- A gunman armed with a shotgun and a semi-automatic rifle opened fire at a Lockheed Martin aircraft plant in Meridian, Mississippi, this morning, killing at least five of his co-workers and injuring eight others before turning a gun on himself, authorities said. "Several of the victims fell at their work stations," Lauderdale County Sheriff Billy Sollie said. Meridian Mayor John Smith called the attack an "unspeakable tragedy."

       A houseful of MT's   We decided to let the kids have a friend over for an "overniter."  Of course, that's not all that unusual in this household.  It seems like we have that almsot every weekend.  If not that, we have a group over for lunch or dinner.  I don't really mind.  It makes them happy and keeps them occupied.  I just gotta wonder why I keep doing this to myself though.  Heh...I think it started when the doctor dropped me on my head.  That would explain alot of things.  (twitch, twitch)    And on tonight's menu   Since the kids have a friend over  (did I mention how grateful I was that it was only one friend?)  the menu for tonight's dinner is going to be simple.  Hot dogs and fries, etc...for them, and sloppy joes and fries for us.  Of course, what overniter would be complete without fresh, homemade brownies?  Speaking of which, I'd better get myself in gear and start cooking before they start coming out of the woodwork and chewing on my ankles.

       Egypt Bans Jim Carrey's 'Bruce Almighty'   You've GOT to be kidding me.  I read this one over on OWW and had to post about it over here.  (the McDonald's post was purely coincidental, we posted at the same time, this one was a deliberate swipe from his blog)   The text in  bold  below are excerpts from the article itself.  My comments, such as they are, are in  italic.    CAIRO, Egypt - Egyptian authorities have banned the Jim Carrey (news) film "Bruce Almighty," saying the comedy infringes on God's sacredness.     Uh...scratching head...isn't this a "commedy?"  I don't remember anything in the movie that actually took a swipe at God, quite the opposite really.    Madkour Thabit, who heads the state-run censorship body responsible for audio and visual productions, criticized the movie Friday for featuring "actors playing the role of God."   "The name of the movie — 'Bruce Almighty' — indicates that there is someone who can do anything and everything," Thabit said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press. "Such traits belong only to God."      Scratch, scratch, scrath (maybe I need a different shampoo).  Let's just recap.  This movie is fiction, it's a commedy, it has ACTORS, playing ROLES.  Where in the movie does it state, or even insinuate, that these characters are real?   Here is the article in  urlLink full.     Looks like they already banned The Matrix Reloaded back in June.  I'm suprised that they haven't banned the Teletubbies yet.  After all, the esteemed Reverend Falwell has stated that Tinky is gay because he carries a "purse" and the "gay pride symbol" adorns the top of his head.  I think Falwell should move to Egypt.  He'd fit in better.     Mood:    Slightly Grouchie   Background noise:    Barking Dog      urlLink  Comments?

       Kissing ban considered for Moscow metro   Uh...remind me again why I live in the United States?  Ok, blatent groping, heavy petting, things of that nature...I could see.  But just giving a peck on the cheek to your mate or a quick hug?  Hello?  I'm wondering if this ban extends to holding hands.  At the rate they are going, you won't be able to hold your kids on your lap.     MOSCOW, Russia (Reuters) -- Couples caught kissing on Moscow's underground rail system could be fined under new regulations being considered by city authorities while those going too far could face jail, a newspaper's Web site said on Friday.   The kissing ban could even extend to a husband embracing his wife, Stolichnaya Vechernyaya Gazeta said on its Web site.       Here's the  urlLink article.

       Saturday morning   Well, it's time to leave the confines of my desk and do something productive.  Perhaps I should think about unpacking my suitcase from the last trip.  Then again....   More on dreams   Ok...what does this mean?  Last night I dreamt that a bull was trying to come through my front door.  True to form, I couldn't get the damn door shut and locked and it kept poking its head through.  I'm beginning to believe that Freud would have a field day with me.     McDonald's Decries Webster Over 'McJob'    I was just surfing a bit and came across this story.  It's seems that McDonalds has a beef (no pun intended) with Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and their definition of the word "McJob".       CHICAGO - McDonald's says it deserves a break from the unflattering way the latest Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary depicts its job opportunities. Among some 10,000 new additions to an updated version released in June was the term "McJob," defined as "low paying and dead-end work."       A spokesman for McDonald's is also concernced that "McJobs" closely resembles McJOBS, a program that trains mentally and physically challenged people.  Looks like there may be some legal issues that will be popping up.  It will be interesting to watch how this pans out.  For the full story, look  urlLink  HERE.

Why in God's name am I moving across country to start a new job, working for people I have little knowledge of, leaving behind my good friends and everything is familiar to me?  It sounded good at the start?  I was pretty confident there was no way that I would be picked because there were quite a few candidates applying for the job?   (true statement)   I hate change.

       I gotta stop sleeping   Either that or maybe I should see a psychiatrist.  I've been having these really strange dreams, not bad mind you, just strange.  I must fall asleep thinking over all of the things that I need to do.  The night before last I was dreaming that the moving van had come and these extremely HUGE, not necessarily intelligent men were carrying the stuff to the truck.  All of a sudden I didn't want to move and started hauling stuff out of the truck and screaming at them to put it all back.  They kept telling me that they couldn't do it because I had to move.   (did I mention I was in my pajamas?)   I kept taking stuff out of the truck, and they kept putting it back in.  Finally, one of them hauled me up and threw me into the truck, and locked it up.  Fast forward....we are in Georgia and I am in temporary housing  (strange, it looked like my house now).   I am trying to get ready for work but having no luck.  I can't seem to move fast enough.  I'm watching the clock and realizing that I'm never going to make it to the first day of my new job on time.  I finally finish, and hop into the car and speed of towards the base.  It's only as I approach the gate that I realize that I don't have my badge.  Before I could explain to the guards, a bunch of marines had surrounded my car and started screaming at me to get out.  I remember vividly that they were all carrying larger than life guns.  I guess that wasn't as bad as the time that I dreamt I was picking up the straws off the cafeteria floor at work because they didn't have any in my temporary housing.  The other night I woke up wondering if they had hangers in the closet or not.   They're coming to take me away, haha, hehe, hoho!

       Stella Awards   I should know better than to post something from A99 without researching it.  Heh...as you can see by this  urlLink link.   I still stand by what I've said before.  Americans are suit happy.  The thing is, they get away with it because the judicial systems is so mucked up.  Kind of a sad state of affairs.  During my searches about this, I came across an interesting story that I found on one of the other forums about the great "coffee case."  Learned something new.  Here it is:  The "coffee case" after which these awards are named is famous.....but once you know the facts the lawsuit does not seem quite so frivolous....  Stella Liebeck of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was in the passenger seat of her grandson's car when she was severely burned by McDonalds' coffee in February 1992. Liebeck, 79 at the time, ordered coffee that was served in a styrofoam cup at the drivethrough window of a local McDonalds.  After receiving the order, the grandson pulled his car forward and stopped momentarily so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. (Critics of civil justice, who have pounced on this case, often charge that Liebeck was driving the car or that the vehicle was in motion when she spilled the coffee; neither is true.) Liebeck placed the cup between her knees and attempted to remove the plastic lid from the cup. As she removed the lid, the entire contents of the cup spilled into her lap.  The sweatpants Liebeck was wearing absorbed the coffee and held it next to her skin. A vascular surgeon determined that Liebeck suffered full thickness burns (or third-degree burns) over 6 percent of her body, including her inner thighs, perineum, buttocks, and genital and groin areas. She was hospitalized for eight days, during which time she underwent skin grafting. Liebeck, who also underwent debridement treatments, sought to settle her claim for $20,000, but McDonalds refused.  During discovery, McDonalds produced documents showing more than 700 claims by people burned by its coffee between 1982 and 1992. Some claims involved third-degree burns substantially similar to Liebecks. This history documented McDonalds' knowledge about the extent and nature of this hazard.  McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.  Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.  Plaintiffs' expert, a scholar in thermodynamics applied to human skin burns, testified that liquids, at 180 degrees, will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds. Other testimony showed that as the temperature decreases toward 155 degrees, the extent of the burn relative to that temperature decreases exponentially. Thus, if Liebeck's spill had involved coffee at 155 degrees, the liquid would have cooled and given her time to avoid a serious burn.  McDonalds asserted that customers buy coffee on their way to work or home, intending to consume it there. However, the companys own research showed that customers intend to consume the coffee immediately while driving.  McDonalds also argued that consumers know coffee is hot and that its customers want it that way. The company admitted its customers were unaware that they could suffer thirddegree burns from the coffee and that a statement on the side of the cup was not a "warning" but a "reminder" since the location of the writing would not warn customers of the hazard.  The jury awarded Liebeck $200,000 in compensatory damages. This amount was reduced to $160,000 because the jury found Liebeck 20 percent at fault in the spill. The jury also awarded Liebeck $2.7 million in punitive damages, which equals about two days of McDonalds' coffee sales.  Post-verdict investigation found that the temperature of coffee at the local Albuquerque McDonalds had dropped to 158 degrees fahrenheit.  The trial court subsequently reduced the punitive award to $480,000 -- or three times compensatory damages -- even though the judge called McDonalds' conduct reckless, callous and willful.  No one will ever know the final ending to this case.  The parties eventually entered into a secret settlement which has never been revealed to the public, despite the fact that this was a public case, litigated in public and subjected to extensive media reporting.

       Belkin disables router spamming feature   It seems that Belkin has had second thoughts and in reponse to all of the negative feed back they have been getting from their customers (like they didn't see that coming), have decided to give users the option of disabling the feature.  Belkin will be offering  a firmware upgrade that will be available to download from its  urlLink website  November 17, 2003.  I'm still struggling with the fact that they did this in the first place.  Here's the link to the  urlLink story.

       The Pussification Of The Western Male    (No, I did not come up with this title)   This was an essay written by Kim du Toit, a self-described writer/raconteur/grouch.  While parts of the essay may have merit, I feel we need to look at a few things that Mr. du Toit points out.  First off, take a look at the essay in full, digest it, and come back to the editorial.  It's a lot to take in and I know that when I first read it, I was fairly sure that the author was smoking some of those funny smelling cigarettes, but after taking more of an in-depth look at him and his site, I realize that he is a man that who has serious convictions about a lot of subjects and is not afraid to put them on paper.  I may not always agree with him (ok, mostly I don't) but you have to admit he's not afraid to put it all out there.   That being said, here is the  urlLink   essay    in full.     We have become a nation of women.    Don't you think that's a rather gross generalization?  As far as I know, men still exist  (unless my husband has been lying  to me all of these years and his name is really Charlene).   Oh, perhaps you were speaking rhetorically?       It wasn't always this way, of course. There was a time when men put their signatures to a document, knowing full well that this single act would result in their execution if captured, and in the forfeiture of their property to the State. Their wives and children would be turned out by the soldiers, and their farms and businesses most probably given to someone who didn't sign the document.    Whenever I read about things like that in history, my opinions were always split in half.  On the one hand, I'd like to admire the male for standing up for what he believes in.  On the other, it bothers me that he would make that decision, knowing what would happen to his family.     There was a time when men went to their certain death, with expressions like "You all can go to hell. I'm going to Texas."  (Davy Crockett, to the House of Representatives, before going to the Alamo.)    I always liked that line.     There was a time when men went to war, sometimes against their own families, so that other men could be free. And there was a time when men went to war because we recognized evil when we saw it, and knew that it had to be stamped out.  There was even a time when a President of the United States threatened to punch a man in the face and kick him in the balls, because the man had the temerity to say bad things about the President's daughter's singing.  We're not like that anymore.    We're not?  Well, didn't we recognize the evil in Sadam Hussein?  Aren't we in Iraq trying to help rebuild the country after their people had to live under years of tyranny?  Aren't we still on the hunt for weapons of mass destruction?  Aren't we busy looking for Bin Laden?  I could go on, but you get my drift.  Are you honestly trying to say that we should support the idea of a President of the United States threatening a man who said his daughter didn't sing well?  Is that the kind of message we want to send to our children?  Mom, Johnny said that he didn't like the color of  my pants so I kicked him in the balls today.        Now, little boys in grade school are suspended for playing cowboys and Indians, cops and crooks, and all the other familiar variations of "good guy vs. bad guy" that helped them learn, at an early age, what it was like to have decent men hunt you down, because you were a lawbreaker.    The kids are suspended for coming to school with knives, and bats, and even guns...any instruments that would be considered a danger to the other children.  Unfortunately, there are children out there who will hurt other children and this is a way to help ensure saftey.  I don't know about Texas, but here in California, kids still do play cops and robbers, etc. at school, but just not with "weapons."  They play it at home as well.  Just come to my house and spend a couple of hours.  Parents play a big part in teaching their kids about abiding by the law.  The fact of the matter is, sometimes, it fails.  No matter how much you teach a child, there are always some that will turn out bad and end up taking multiple weapons to a school and blow other children and teachers away just as if it were the opening of hunting season.       Now, men are taught that violence is bad -- that when a thief breaks into your house, or threatens you in the street, that the proper way to deal with this is to "give him what he wants", instead of taking a horsewhip to the rascal or shooting him dead where he stands.    See, the thing is, thieves tend to come in to your house with guns, or other weapons.  I think the whole premise behind "give him what he wants" is more of a warning to act with caution.  Hey, if I hear the thief break in and see him before he sees me  (along with my trusty sidekick, Samm (.357) , you can be sure that if he isn't  flat on his face kissing the pavement when I tell him to, he'll be seriously considering a sex change operation when I'm through with him.       Now, men's fashion includes not a man dressed in a three-piece suit, but a tight sweater worn by a man with breasts.  Now, warning labels are indelibly etched into gun barrels, as though men have somehow forgotten that guns are dangerous things.    I prefer the casual look anyway.  I never thought a three-piece suit on a man was all that sexy.  Kind of makes them look prudish if you ask me.  I keep picturing them in a salon, getting their nails done.  I shudder when I think of men with breasts.  I must admit to not seeing much of that here, but hey, to each his own.  Women have them, why can't men?     Now, men are given Ritalin as little boys, so that their natural aggressiveness, curiosity and restlessness can be  controlled, instead of nurtured and directed.    Um, sorry pal, you missed the boat on that one.  Little boys are given Ritalin because the school system is too quick to put a label on children.  Ever heard of ADD/ADHD?  They refuse to treat the problem when a child doesn't fit a particular model.  "He's not behaving, here give him this drug.  That'll make him better."  (sad thing is, parents give in this way to easily)    And you know what that does?  The little boy becomes a man and nobody has helped him deal with his "problems."  Pretty soon, he stops taking the drugs, because, what the hell, they don't work anyway.  Then, he can't hold a job, he starts using other types of drugs that are much worse.  Then he goes into your house to rob you so that he can get a fix.  Then you come downstairs and blow his face off.  "Shoot him dead where he stands" is what I believe you said.     And finally, our President, who happens to have been a qualified fighter pilot, lands on an aircraft carrier wearing a flight suit, and is immediately dismissed with words like "swaggering", "macho" and the favorite epithet of Euro girly-men, "cowboy". Of course he was bound to get that reaction -- and most especially from the Press in Europe, because the process of male pussification Over There is almost complete.   How did we get to this?   In the first instance, what we have to understand is that America is first and foremost, a culture dominated by one figure: Mother. It wasn't always so: there was a time when it was Father who ruled the home, worked at his job, and voted. But in the twentieth century, women became more and more involved in the body politic, and in industry, and in the media --and mostly, this has not been a good thing. When women got the vote, it was inevitable that government was going to become more powerful, more intrusive, and more "protective" (ie. more coddling), because women are hard-wired to treasure security more than uncertainty and danger. It was therefore inevitable that their feminine influence on politics was going to emphasize (lowercase "s") social security.   I am aware of the fury that this statement is going to arouse, and I don't care a fig.    Good lord, I'm having flash backs of burping, belching, scratching and farting contests.  I think that in a lot of cases, America looks to moms because, essentially, it is "Mom" that brings us up, guides us, holds us when we hurt.  I'm not sure whether you wrote that statment for shock value, or if you really believe it.  Cause fury?  Quite the opposite.  The idea intrigues me, not because I like it but because, try as I might, I can find no correlation beetween women voting and the power of government.  I'd like to see specific examples before I made up my mind, but I don't think they exist.      What I care about is the fact that since the beginning of the twentieth century, there has been a concerted campaign to denigrate men, to reduce them to figures of fun, and to render them impotent, figuratively speaking.   I'm going to illustrate this by talking about TV, because TV is a reliable barometer of our culture.   In the 1950s, the TV Dad was seen as the lovable goofball -- perhaps the beginning of the trend -- BUT he was still the one who brought home the bacon, and was the main source of discipline (think of the line: "Wait until your father gets home!").    Heh, in my house, Mom took care of it immediately, and then we had to tell Dad when he got home.  The anticipation of that was enough to do you in.  Dad never added to the punishment, but telling dad that you screwed up was much worse.  If you take a look at the economy today, you will see why it's not only just Dad that brings home the bacon.  Take California for example.  The cost of housing alone is justification for both parents working.  Hav you seen the schools here?  They suck.  So if you want  your child to have a good education you need to send them to a private school.  Most families don't have the luxury of only needing one parent to work.  You have to do what's best for your kids.     From that, we went to this: the Cheerios TV ad.   Now, for those who haven't seen this piece of shit, I'm going to go over it, from memory, because it epitomizes everything I hate about the campaign to pussify men. The scene opens at the morning breakfast table, where the two kids are sitting with Dad at the table, while Mom prepares stuff on the kitchen counter. The dialogue goes something like this:  Little girl (note, not little boy): Daddy, why do we eat Cheerios?  Dad: Because they contain fiber, and all sorts of stuff that's good for the heart. I eat it now, because of that.  LG: Did you always eat stuff that was bad for your heart, Daddy?  Dad (humorously): I did, until I met your mother.  Mother (not humorously): Daddy did a lot of stupid things before he met your mother.   Now, every time I see that TV ad, I have to be restrained from shooting the TV with a .45 Colt. If you want a microcosm of how men have become less than men, this is the perfect example.   What Dad should have replied to Mommy's little dig: Yes, Sally, that's true: I did do a lot of stupid things before I met your mother. I even slept with your Aunt Ruth a few times, before I met your mother.   That's what I would have said, anyway, if my wife had ever attempted to castrate me in front of the kids like that.   But that's not what men do, of course. What this guy is going to do is smile ruefully, finish his cereal, and then go and fuck his secretary, who doesn't try to cut his balls off on a daily basis. Then, when the affair is discovered, people are going to rally around the castrating bitch called his wife, and call him all sorts of names. He'll lose custody of his kids, and they will be brought up by our ultimate modern-day figure of sympathy: The Single Mom.  You know what? Some women deserve to be single moms.    I haven't seen that commercial, but the next time you do, give me a call.  I'll hold your ammo for you.   Society today has a strong focus on health.  With all of the advances in medical technology, we have found ways of improving our health and living longer.  In order for "food related" companies to survive during these times, they need to market their product accordingly.  While I wish the folks at Cheerios had found a different way to do that, I can see where they are coming from.  I agree with you that cutting your spouse down in front of the children is a flat out no-no.  No arguments there.  But don't blame the woman for the man not being able to keep his willy in his pants.  The man needs to have the guts to stand up to his spouse and verbalize his feelings about her behavior, not just lick his wounds with a blonde bimbo, who likely doesn't know the difference between a typewriter and a nail file (no more brains than a box of rocks comes to mind).  If he doesn't have the guts to try to fix the problem, or "trying" doesn't work, then he needs to rustle up some chutzpah and remove himself from the situation.   People tend to rally around either the mother or the father when an affair is discovered.  It depends on who is doing the "stepping out."  The sympathy is always going to go to the victim.  Divorce, for whatever reason, sucks.  It's worse when there are kids involved.  The problem herein lies with the parents who tend to use their children as weapons, instead of stepping back from the situation and analyzing what would be best for the children, rather than how best to hurt the other spouse.  In the past, the law has tended to give the mother custody of the children, and the father, visitation rights.  Over the past few years, that attitude has been changing but it definitely has a long way to go.      When I first started this website, I think my primary aim was to blow off steam at the stupidity of our society.   Because I have fairly set views on what constitutes right and wrong, I have no difficulty in calling Bill Clinton, for example, a fucking liar and hypocrite.    AMEN!  Next........    But most of all, I do this website because I love being a man. Amongst other things, I talk about guns, self-defense, politics, beautiful women, sports, warfare, hunting, and power tools -- all the things that being a man entails. All this stuff gives me pleasure.    Mostly I started mine just to put things down on paper.  Didn't matter what.  I talked alot about my family in the beginning, then that kind of spread off to other things.  In alot of cases, it became a place to vent out my frustrations in whatever way I wanted.  I have an insane urge to put "it" down on paper.  I just haven't figure out what "it" is yet.  I've really just started.  Got a long way to go.      Yes, the men are, by and large, slobs. Big fucking deal. Last time I looked, that's normal. Men are slobs, and that only changes when women try to civilize them by marriage. That's the natural order of things.   Real men, on the other hand, have big fucking mean-ass dogs: Rhodesian ridgebacks, bull terriers and Rottweilers, or else working dogs like pointers or retrievers which go hunting with them and slobber all over the furniture.   Women own lapdogs.    Yes, they are.  Marriage doesn't change that.  Perhaps there are women out there who are dumb enough to try, but they'll fail, hands down.    As far as the dog comment...I don't like lap dogs.  Never have.  I've got a Basenji/Cattledog mix that pretty much follows me around everywhere.  She goes at about 20 lbs, comes up to about my knee, and is one little tough cookie.  Of course,  (that rock comment is coming to mind again)  she doesn't always show how smart she is.  We had a balloon stuck outside on a bush in front of the house and she barked at it until the wind blew it away.  She holds her own with the other dogs, no matter what size/breed, and if you mess with her family, you'll be getting a birds eye view of what her teeth look like  (and feel like).       Which is why women are trying to get dog-fighting and cock-fighting banned -- they'd ban boxing too, if they could -- because it's "mean and cruel". No shit, Shirley. Hell, I don't like the idea of fighting dogs, either, but I don't have a problem with men who do. Dogs and cocks fight. So do men. No wonder we have an affinity for it.    I don't have a problem with men boxing.  If men are stupid enough to let themselves get battered in the head until they have no brain cells left, then that's their decision.  It's their choice.  The animals don't have a choice.  They are forced to fight.  If they don't they become seriously injured, and in many cases, dead.      Speaking of rap music, do you want to know why more White boys buy that crap than Black boys do? You know why rape is such a problem on college campuses? Why binge drinking is a problem among college freshmen?   It's a reaction: a reaction against being pussified. And I understand it, completely. Young males are aggressive, they do fight amongst themselves, they are destructive, and all this does happen for a purpose.   Because only the strong men propagate.    Whoa, wait a second.  Where is your justification for that association?  The rise in rape and drinking, as well as other things can be blamed on society as a whole.  The drinking and drug usage has risen over the years, and is even more prevalent in our schools, sometimes starting as early as grade school.  That's where the education needs to start.  By excusing the male behavior because of your so called theory of male pussification,  (think Ritalin)  you are masking the real problem at hand.  The education of things such as this, starts at home, and is strengthened at school.  Now, here's your beer...go watch some football. I'll help the kids with the homework and cook some dinner.  Just as soon as I find my shoes......    Mood:    Irritable   Background noise:    Printers     urlLink  Comments?

       The countdown officially begins   Well, today the had my going away luncheon and it was really fabulous.  I was overwhelmed.  There were 37 people that showed up.  I could hardly believe it.  The food was wonderful and I saw people that I hadn't seen in quite some time.  My husband, brother and his fiancee were invited as well.  I got a beautiful crystal dish, complete with a lid, with my name inscribed on it, as well as  "We will miss you, November 14th, 2003"  (the date will be my last day there).  I was very touched.  I think that was the point that marked the beginning of my countdown.  There is no turning back now.   Paperless Society   Uhhhh...where?    What would we do without email?  I mean, come on.  How many of us have had a work stoppage when our email was down?  It amazes me.  We use the telephone alot less these days because it seems to be easier to just zip off an email.  Of course, the powers that be state that this is one of the engines that enables us to have a paperless society.  Pardon me, how long have you been taking those mind altering drugs?  I don't know about the rest of you but it certainly doesn't work that way when your customer is the Navy (or any Government entity).  We may have email, and use our computers extensively, but I still have  PAPER  files.  I have two bookshelves right now, filled completely with binders that keep records of everything.  And alot of them go way back to when God invented dirt.  I won't even talk about the file drawers I have.  You know, those stupid one's that lock up when you try to open up more that one drawer at a time?  So, I don't get it.  Paperless society?  Yeah..in your dreams pal.   Over at  urlLink OWW,  the old man's place, the origin of Midget Terrorist is finally revealed.      My Mad Friend from Texas informs me that he did not originate the term "Midget Terrorists". That one was invented by the cartoonist Berkely Breathed, in the strip "Bloom County".  Credit where credit is due....      I say horse  shit  pucky.  The modeled that after my kids.  They were the inspiration.  Mr. Breathed, I'm going to sue your  arse  pants off.  Then I can retire early.  Think I'm kidding?  Look at these Stella awards posted by my friend A99 over on one of the forums I'm an administrator at.          STELLA AWARDS 2002    It's once again time to review the winners of the annual Stella awards.   The Stella's are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonalds. That case inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous, successful lawsuits in the United States.   Unfortunately the most recent lawsuit implicating McDonalds, the teens that allege that eating at McDonalds has made them fat, was filed after the 2002 award voting was closed. This suit will top the 2003 awards list without question.   5th place (Tied)  A jury of her peers awarded Kathleen Robertson of Austin Texas $780,000 after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving toddler was Ms. Robertson's son.   5th place (Tied)  19-year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently did not notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal the hubcaps.   5th place (Tied)  Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He could not re-enter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation and Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for 8 days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found and a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the house owner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The Jury agreed to the tune of $500,000.   4th place  Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next-door neighbor's Beagle dog. The Beagle was on a chain in his owner's fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been a little provoked at the time, as Mr. Williams who had climbed over the fence into the yard was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun.   3rd place  A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink and broke her coccyx (tailbone). The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.   2nd place  Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware sued the owner of a nightclub in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out two of her front teeth. This occurred whilst Ms. Walton was trying to sneak out of the window in the Ladies Room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.   1st place  This year's runaway winner was Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new Winnebago motor home. On his trip home from a football game, having driven onto the freeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the RV left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner's manual that he could not actually do this. The jury awarded him $1,750,000 plus a new Winnebago Motor Home.   The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit just in case there were any other complete morons buying their recreational vehicles.      Obviously, you don't know me.

       Aaack!   It's Sunday evening and other than having a rather large group of midget terrorists in my living room, there is nothing going on.  I've really gotten nothing done this weekend, at least not what I had planned.  I still have my suitcase to unpack...it's sitting there calling me.  But the voice of reason asks:  What are you unpacking for, you'll just have to fill me up in a week?  I should probably get that done, and then clean up the kitchen a bit.  My husband and I decided to be lazy today. It's a good feeling.  We did pretty much NOTHING all day.  The kids played outside, lounged around, we played games...nothing earth shattering.  Now, they are playing with a gaggle of friends and I'm up here telling myself to get busy.  Not that it's doing any good.  Damn suitcase is stubborn.  Won't unpack itself.  My boss came to me and asked who I wanted to invite to my going away luncheon.  I tried to tell her that I didnt' want one, but that didn't go over well.  It's understandable, I've been there 21 years, so I caved.  I gave her a small list...and after talking to her on Thursday...looks like the list isn't small anymore.  I guess one could say that's a compliment to me...a testimonial of how much I was liked.  I keep thinking..."oh God...how am I going to hold it together?."   An interesting diagram   Parents may want to keep this away from their kids...at least until they are out of their house.

       Spam: Do Not Contact Me, Ever   I read an interesting article in  urlLink eWeek  this morning.       All over the world, companies are bracing for the possibility that angry customers—weary of answering phone calls from strange salespeople during their dinner hours and opening e-mail boxes filled with pornography—will test the limits of their right to privacy by filing a lawsuit. The customers may even have the force of law on their side.      We've already got some "Do Not Call" regulations in place and it seems we are trying to add "Do Not Spam" to the list as well.       In September, California Gov. Gray Davis signed the nation's toughest statewide legislation to date regulating the sending of electronic spam. The law, which Long Island, N.Y.-based Publishers Clearing House is watching carefully, gives residents the right to sue anybody that sends them unsolicited commercial e-mail and establishes fines of $1,000 per message, or as much as $1 million. It is scheduled to take effect January 1.      There would be a database set up, much like the "Do Not Call" registry, which would severely limit the use of email to sell services or products.  It is said that it will be difficult for companies to comply with these new regulations because there is no clear cut definition of "recipients consent."     Let's get real here.  Do you really think that this will change things?  I fear that most likely, it will have little or no impact on spammers because, as the article states, "they are difficult to find."  Truth in advertising needs to be enforced.  History shows us that the FTC has been lackadaisical in enforcing it.  Spammers would need to get rid of any misleading statements in their emails.  If they advertised that their product was new and improved, then they would need to clearly prove that, in advance.  Marketers would like us to believe that the implementation of this regulation would violate their "Freedom of Speech."  After all, no one is forcing us to listen.  My argument is if I have to pick up the phone to listen to them, or delete an email, then I am being forced to listen.  I did not ask them to call or email me.  I read a discussion on this and one reader put it best:  "They are free to 'speak' all they want, just not in my home, in my ear or in my Inbox."

       Midget Terrorists   Something could be said about having boys vs girls.  I'm not sure what it is as I have been  cursed  blessed with having two girls.  I was so happy.  Just think, two girls, pink dresses, pretty little bows in their hair, black patent leather shoes, clean little faces, impeccable manners.  I'm sad to report that my children suffer from an error in genetic coding.  That whole chromosome thing must have got messed up.  I think my girls must have the qq chromosome.  Either that or the powers that be were feeling humorous and decided to play a game with me.  I've got two girls, currently 9 and 5, and while they like to play dress up, and play with dolls  (they abhor Barbies at the moment, unless said Barbies are naked and they are playing with them in the bathtub)  the rest of them is all boy.  Dirt is something to be played in, not avoided.  They climb trees, wrestle with their buddies, and only have to look at mud to get dirty.  Take this morning for instance.  My daughters were bringing their hands up to their mouths and blowing on them, essentially having a contest to see who could make the loudest farting noises.  What is it about bodily noises that amuse children so much?    I guess I should be thankful they don't walk around the house in boxers, belching, farting and scratching themselves.

       The last hoorah   Well, this is it folks.  The beginning of my last week here in California.  I've mixed emotions about it but feel it's the right thing to do.  Tomorrow will be my going away luncheon at work and pretty much the rest of the week will be spent cleaning out my desk, passing on files and binders, cleaning up my data on my computer and getting it ready to transfer to my new computer in Georgia.  That and spending a lot of time getting things coordinated for the move.    Now...on to more important stuff!   Illegal Immigrant Workers Sue Wal-Mart      FREEHOLD, N.J. - Nine illegal immigrants who worked as janitors at Wal-Mart until they were arrested during federal raids last month have sued the company, accusing it of discrimination  The nine say they were paid lower wages and offered fewer benefit because they are Mexicans, and they accuse Wal-Mart and its cleaning contractors of failing to pay for overtime, withhold taxes or make required workers' compensation contributions.       There is something definitely wrong with this picture.  First off, does the word "illegal" not mean anything to anyone?  They were lucky to have a job at all.  If they were in the country legally, then I would say they have a right to sue.     According to the lawsuit, Wal-Mart employed cleaning contractors "with full knowledge" that they paid illegal immigrants less than legal workers.   "Wal-Mart must have known about these violations," the immigrant's lawyer, Gilberto Garcia, told The New York Times. "If these people are going to work at Wal-Marts, then Wal-Mart and its contractors should abide by the labor laws."         Whether Wal-Mart knew or not is not an issue.  Since they hired the contractors, they are ultimately responsible.  You know the saying...shit rolls downhill?  Well, in business, the stinky stuff rolls uphill as well.    Do the labor laws actually apply to someone who is in the country illegally?     "Clearly, hungry lawyers are converging on these illegal immigrants as if they were accident victims," Williams said. "We have seen absolutely no evidence showing that Wal-Mart did anything wrong."       Sounds something like ambulance chasers.     She acknowledged that Wal-Mart has received a letter from federal prosecutors warning that it faces a grand jury investigation into illegal immigrants employed at its stores. An employer can face civil and criminal penalties for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants or failing to comply with certain employee record keeping regulations.       Yes, and the Wal-Mart and the contractor should be held accountable for hiring illegal immigrants.  But being sued for labor violations?  The pieces of the puzzle just don't fit here.

       Justified?  You be the judge.   I seriously think that Charles Booher is my hero.  Alright, so maybe some of you think that he may have overreacted just a tad.  Bullshit.  Let's be honest here folks.  What he did was verbalize (well, put in writing) what we all feel, but are too chicken legged to do.  Let's take a look at the story.  Can you honestly tell me that you haven't even "thought" about doing the same thing?       Charles Booher said he is normally a non-violent person. In his spare time, he writes software programs that he likens to Andy Warhol art projects. The last time the Sunnyvale resident got in a fight, he was 11 years old.  But in May, Booher received one piece of unsolicited e-mail too many. Booher sat down at his keyboard and began firing back e-mail after e-mail threatening to kill the alleged spammer, according to law enforcement officials. On Thursday, federal agents arrested Booher, 44, at his home and charged him with 11 violations of interstate communications.     Arrest him?  The man should be canonized.  Ok, ok...the way he went about it was probably not so good.  You never send an email that can be traced back to you.   He's a programmer, he should have known better.  Personally, I'm thinking of taking up a collection to help him with his legal fees.     ``If I could go back, I wouldn't have done it,'' he said Friday. ``I would have realized sooner that I needed to shut my Web site down, to shut down my e-mail and to re-evaluate the way I was using the Internet.''  Booher said the nature of the spam he received set off an emotional trigger. He said he is a three-time survivor of testicular cancer and that he was bombarded by e-mail and pop-up ads for penile enlargement. No matter what he did, he couldn't get them to go away. ``I wanted them to leave me alone,'' he said.      Geee...looking at the circumstances, I'd say the guy was somewhat justified in his actions.  Especially as he did take steps to stop the spamming.  Of course, the wimp assed Doug MacKay wouldn't step up to the plate.   (Yo Charles...you hold him down and I'll slap him!)   Read on.     He first tried to figure out a technical solution. A professional programmer, he said he has a bachelor's degree in physics from the Illinois Institute of Technology, a master's in electrical engineering from Northwestern, as well as certificates in computer programming from the University of California-Santa Cruz and in the history of science from Stanford University.  When the ads wouldn't stop, Booher said he contacted the company, Albion Medical, which appeared to be sending the spam, and asked to speak with Doug Mackay, whose name had appeared on one of the unsolicited advertisements.  ``I said, `Will you please stop spamming me so much,' '' Booher recalled. ``He said, `I'd like to try, but it's complicated. I have literally millions of agents out there.' ''  ``It started polite, but it went downhill from there,'' Booher said.      Ok..so let's look at the facts so far.    1.  Mr. Booher received insurmountable amounts of SPAM regarding penile enhancement. 2.  Mr. Booher is a three time survivor of testicular cancer.   3.  Mr. Booher tried emailing Mr. Buttface-MacKay to ask him to stop. 4.  Said Buttface declined to help, citing complications.  (Did he even look into it?  I think not.) 5.  Mr. Booher begain his well justified campain to stop the harassment.    Ah...here we go.  The heart of the matter.  Chuck has a vivid imagination, bless his little tiny pointed head.     In May, Booher began sending Mackay blood-chilling e-mails. Excerpts from the e-mails were filed with the criminal complaint against Booher. In an e-mail dated June 14, Booher promises Mackay he will ``locate you, disable you using a quick 22 calibre shot to your lower spine and then duck tape. . . . I am going to cut into the left side of your brain using a power drill and an ice pick.      Whew...that would hurt.  Do you think it worked?  Think again.     ``He's obviously a very sick man,'' said Mackay from his office in Canada. Mackay insists his company, DM Contact Management, has nothing to do with spam and has no relationship with the companies who were spamming Booher. In a telephone interview, Mackay said his company handled customer service for Internet companies, answering telephone queries and taking orders. ``We don't deal with any e-mail marketing at all,'' he said.      Woohooo...Mr. MacKay...you are more full of poop (notice I didn't say shit?) than a Christmas turkey.  You deny it?  Then how do you explain this?      Booher said he threatened Mackay because the tactic seemed to work. ``I would scream at him and it would stop, and then it would start up again, and then I would scream at him again.''      How come the spamming stopped?  You still say you had no control over it?  What kind of sick moron are you?  To allow this kind of thing to be sent to a man who is fighting for his life, THREE TIMES.  You have the balls to allow someone to send him advertisements regarding penile enlargement.  Well Mr. MacKay, tell me this.  Have you ever gone through chemotherapy?  Radiation?  Had your hair fall out?  Worshipped the porcelain god because you have chemicals in your body fighting a war against a deadly disease?  Obviously not.  You would rather take the position of most upper management and pretend it never happened.  I won't go on in my comments because I'm heading on over to Booher's house to help him in his defense.  Before you get your panties in a wad, I don't condone what he did.  It was stupid.  But I think it was justifiable.  Spamming has to stop and those who are condoning in MUST be held responsible.  Freedom of speech my ass.  Mr. MacKay is a sorry excuse for a wipe-ass human being, if he can even be called that.   Hey Charles, I've got several ice picks for you to choose from.  come on over for some home cooking and we'll see what we can do to help you out.   Read the full article  urlLink here.    I've got better things to do.  Like go have a Silly String fight with my girls out front.  They don't believe in spam.  They believe in wearing me down by whining.  Dayum..they're good.   Favorite quote of the moment    There's a silly old saying that if you hold a guinea pig up by its tail, its eyes will drop out.

       Shameless Pimping   Ok folks, it's time for some shameless pimping or you could call it, free advertising.  I've been working a bit on   urlLink  So It Goes  .  I've rearranged some things, renamed some others and added some new topics as well as forums.  After you've taken a look around, take a look at the  urlLink poll  and cast your vote.  If you have the time, please register as well.  Let me know what you would like to see on the forums.  Just what would it take to bring you back to visit?   The Lighter Side   I thought I'd add a bit of humor to my ramblings today.  Got this from my other half in an email.  Remember Jeff Foxworthy?  Well, here's a complement to his "You Might Be A Redneck If..."   YOU JUST MIGHT BE A BLUENECK IF...   ...Instead of referring to two or more people as "Y'all," you call them "you guys," even if both of them are women.  ...You think barbecue is a verb meaning "to cook outside."  ...You think Heinz Ketchup is really SPICY.  ...You would never stop to buy something somebody was cooking on the side of the road. (e.g., boiled peanuts) .  ...You don't have any problems pronouncing "Worcestershire sauce" correctly.  ...For breakfast, you would prefer potatoes-au-gratin to grits.  ...You don't know what a moon pie is.  ...You've never had an RC Cola.  ...You've never, ever eaten okra -- fried, boiled, or pickled.  ...You eat fried chicken with a knife and fork.  ...You've never seen a live chicken, and the only cows you've seen are on road trips.  ...You have no idea what a polecat is.  ...You don't see anything wrong with putting a sweater on your dog.  ...You don't have bangs.  ...You would rather have your son become a lawyer than grow up to get his own TV fishing show.  ...You drink either "Pop" or "Soda"- instead of "Cokes."  ...You've never eaten and don't know how to make a tomato sandwich.  ....You have never planned your summer vacation around a gun-'n-knife show.  ...You think more money should go to important scientific research at your university than to pay the salary of the head football coach  ...You don't even have one can of WD-40 somewhere around the house.  ...The last time you smiled was when you blocked someone from getting on an on-ramp to the highway.  ....You don't have any hats in your closet that advertise feed stores.  ...You have more than one professional sports team in your home state.  ...You call binoculars opera glasses.  ...You can't spit out the car window without pulling over to the side of the road and stopping.  ...You don't know anyone with at least two first names (i.e., Joe Bob, Faye Ellen, Billy Ray, Mary Jo, Bubba Dean, Joe Dan, Mary Alice)  ...You don't know any women with male names (i.e., Tommie, Bobbie, Johnnie, Jimmie)  ...You don't have Maw-maw's & Pawpaw's.  ...You get freaked out when people on the subway talk to you.  ...None of your fur coats are homemade.   Quick thoughts moving through the wasted space known as my brain   Am I going to have to learn to like boiled peanuts, fried okra and collard greens now that I am moving to Georgia?   Oh, now here's a winner!   Folks, you really have to wonder about the people who were the observers in this little exercise.  You would have thought that the smell  ALONE  would have been enough to give them an idea that this was not a good place to be.     urlLink Check it out!    Favorite Feminist Joke    Q. How many feminists does it take to replace a lightbulb?   A. That's not funny!   Got this from Kim du Toit's site and got a good chuckle out of it.  I even wrote him back on it.  It just struck me as funny.  I think because, even though we members of the feminine population don't like to admit it, it's true.  Below was my response.  Kim, you da man!  I'm sure this will piss off some of the ladies out there, but hey, if you can't take the heat....tell me where I'm wrong.     OMG...that was priceless.  I need to learn to not sip coffee while reading your stuff.  I just found out what it feels like to have it spew out of your nose.   And it's so TRUE.  Of course, you realize another standard response would be "If you don't know the answer to that one, I'm not going to tell you."  (effectively letting you know that you are in deep doo-doo, and will receive the cold shoulder until you can learn to read minds).  Did you ever notice how we are able, with certain body movements, and one measly little word [FINE], tell you, in no uncertain terms, to fuck off?  I'd like to stand up and shout "I AM NOT LIKE THAT AND WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING", but I'd be a liar.    Thanks for the laugh Kim.  You made my day.  Moogie       Too close to home   We've visited this park any number of times.  Just another reason I'm glad I'm leaving this God forsaken city/state.  Add that to the thousands I already have.......  Stuff like this is just too prevalent here.  Too much violence.  Overcrowding, high cost of living, high jobless rate...it's a wonder more people aren't killed here every day.  Bad place to raise the kids.  And don't even get me started on our governor, or the recall race.  What a bunch of linguini spined bureaucrats.  Here's the  urlLink article   in question.   News of the Weird   Now it seems that not only do turkeys taste better when they are organically fed, they also are improved (less prone to disease, better taste).    Honey, where's that blasted CD.  Henry here looks a little boney..we need to plump him up for Thanksgiving or we may as well just eat a cornish game hen.    I'm not making this up.  Really.......  Read about it  urlLink here.

       Sunday Stuff   The trip to Georgia last week was relatively uneventful, except that the directions from the airport to my temporary housing were WRONG.  Took me over two hours to find it.  And WHY, you might ask, would it take that long?  Well, first of all, my home is located just over an hour from the airport.  Secondly, it is located in bumcrap Egypt.  It takes me over 45 minutes to get from my home (almost an hour) to work.  You think maybe, just maybe, they could have found something closer?  All in all, it's a nice place.  Pretty well equipped.  It's just really far out in the stix and the area I have to drive through to get to it doesn't warm the cockles of my heart.  Of course, next week I'll be bringing the kids back with me so that will be even more comforting.  I keep telling myself that it's just temporary, and it will be over soon.  I figure if I keep saying that often enough, I'll believe it.  I went to the school where I want my kids to go.  At first I was told that they would have to go to school in Brunswick.  I countered with the fact that they were only going to be there 30 days.  They wouldn't budge.  It amazes me that people who are supposedly out for the children, would see a child moved completely across country, away from all that was familiar, started in a school, only to stay there for 30 days, and then moved to the area of which we plan to settle.  Go figure.  I found a work-around which I can imagine, most of you can figure out on your own.  There's going to be alot of running around to do this week.  Picking up shot records for the kids, gathering up all the paperwork, getting as much as I can crammed in the suitcases for me and the girls.  The normal stuff.  Oh..that and finishing up inspections on our present house, and doing getting some estimates on a repair to the balcony we have to make.   Michael Jackson Hoopla   I don't know what to believe on this one.  It seems to me that folks are out to get him because he does not fit the stereotype of what we call "normal."  Don't get me wrong, if he is guilty, string the bastard up by the balls, cover him with honey, and place him next to a behive.  But I have to wonder if it is all true.  Granted, the man has had more face lifts than Imelda Marcos has shoes.  Ok, let's face it.  He looks like a woman, minus the hooters, but does all of this make him a child molester?  I was reading a post about this on a forum I visit from time to time and it makes me SICK to listen to people judge him based soley on what they read.  That last I heard you were innocent until proven guilty in this country.     Mood:  Quiet     Background noise:  Full House       urlLink  Comments?

       **Update on Rags**   Well, I've cleaned out his tank, and added fresh water and the necessary chemicals to kill the ick.  Now, we wait.  On the upside, Rags did eat a couple of the pellets I through in there for him and swam a bit.  Now he's not moving all that much but time will tell.    We're going over to our neighbors for dinner tonight so that ought to be fun.  I'm hoping that pulls me out of this funk I'm in.  The girls went off with Charlie to pick up a big suprise for mom (Sharon).  They are our neighbors across the street.  Great couple.  Their kids are older than ours but we get along great.  Sharon kept me company while I cleaned the tanks.    Mood:  getting into the grove     Background Noise:  Boxen Crunching

       I can hear a pin drop   Praise the Lord and pass the peanuts.  The kids are over at the neighbors with my husband and all is quiet.  I need this time alone to regroup my thoughts.  I woke up on the wrong side of the bed and it's only gotten worse.  I'm not sure what started me off in such a bad mood or why I'm still there.  Bah...so it goes.   Three more children   We recently adopted three betas named Dude Jr. (aka DJ), Rags and Twinkie (full name Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star).  Cute little buggers and easy to take care of too.  Poor Rags seems to have come down with a case of Ick so I had to go out and by some stuff to put into his tank.  I've been procrastinating doing this all day.  Guess I should get off my duff and do something about it.  Then I need to clean the other two's tanks out as well.  I thought that these were supposed to be the girls fish.  Man, they have me fooled.     The new house   It's awesome.  We are really loving it here.  The neighbors are great as well.  Kind of hard to believe that we finally made it.  It's a 4 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 car garage with a little over 1,700 square feet and an acre of land.  It even came with a ride on mower.  The weather here hasn't been conducive to starting it up and giving it a run around the yard until today.  I think my husband was just waiting for the chance.  I just hope he doesn't start wearing a straw hat and whistling the Green Acres theme song and start scratching himself.   Man rescued from Space Needle observation deck   Oh, hellooooo?  I'm thinking this guy has done a few too many cartwheels.  I had a hard enough time being on top of that thing the right way.  No way in Hades would I attempt to do that.  I'm thinking that once I wiggled one arm through my heart would stop with sheer fright.  Man, I hope he gets some  urlLink help  soon.     Comments   I've added comments to my blog so this means that I've got to actually start posting again so you'll have something to comment on.  I've got a bad case of writers block and I've heard that it can be exasperated by finding yourself buried in boxes or if your beta fish has a case of ick.  Hey...I don't know about you but those excuses work for me.  I don't know what's wrong with me lately.  I'm so bloody tired.  It most likely stems from the whole move fiasco.  Long stints away from my family, living in temporary housing with 2 kids, a dog and a husband (sorry honey, you don't get top billing here), and being stressed at learning a new job.  Don't get me wrong, the move went well as moves go, and I LOVE my job (I just hate learning curves, don't you?), but it's really stressful.  Awe, what the heck..the boxes will still be there in the morning.     California wedding to go on   Having just moved from California after living there 30+ years of my life, I guess  urlLink  this   shouldn't really surprise me.  I guess that I really don't know what the big deal about it is.  Why are so many people against it?  Who are they hurting?  As long as what they are doing in no way harms my family or friends (or anyone else for that matter), what business is it of mine to tell them who they can or cannot marry?    Long ago, I made my peace with how I feel about homosexuality.  It's not for me, no, but I don't feel it's wrong either.  It's my belief that homosexuality isn't something you choose.  I doubt that anyone wakes up in the morning and says "hey, I think I'll be gay."  It's a rough road for them all the way through.  I admire them for going after what they need in life.  Lord knows there are enough people out there willing to vilify them.   And in this corner, we have the lovely U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown (D - Jacksonville, FL)   How in the hell did this woman get into power?       According to the Florida Times-Union, U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown (D - Jacksonville, FL), verbally attacked a Bush administration official during a briefing on the Haiti crisis on Wednesday (yesterday).  Rep. Brown, who is black, called President Bush's policy on Haiti "racist", and referred to the Administration's representatives as "a bunch of white men".  The Administration's representative, Roger Noriega, a Mexican-American, is the State Department's top official for Latin America.  Noriega later told Brown "As a Mexican-American, I deeply resent being called a racist and branded a white man", to which Brown responded "you all look alike to me".      And SHE calls Bush's administration racist?   I saw where she apologized the next day and said she felt that she was misunderstood.  Not a lot in your comments to misunderstand lady.  You need to go to Miss Manner's school to learn how to keep your oversized boats out of your mouth.    Mood:  Grumpy     Background Noise:  Silence

       Stewart Predicts She'll Be Exonerated    It doesn't really surprise me all that much.  In the beginning, I really felt that someone who didn't like her was out to get her.  I couldn't understand why someone so rich, would do something so stupid, for a net gain of basically nothing compared to the vast empire she had.  Then I started following the story.  As I read on and learned more, I started to get the impression that she felt that she could get away with it.  After all, she was Martha Stewart.  Is she guilty?  It still looks that way but I do believe that she has a better than even chance of getting away with it, and at most, getting a bit of a slap on the wrist.  Let's face it.  The woman is a bitch.  But she's a damn filthy rich bitch.  You know the saying.  Money  urlLink talks.   Look what happened with O.J. Simpson.   Planes, trains and automobiles..oh yes, and toads   We live on an acre, and most of our land resides in our backyard.  There's a privacy fence in the back, and directly behind that, is a  lake.   One of the things that this so called body of water hosts, is toads.  Apparently, that's not all but I'll go into more detail when I experience them.  My husband was moving some boxes around in the garage one day and had left the garage door open.   When he was done, he closed up the garage and went about the rest of the day.  The next morning, he went out in the garage, not paying attention to where he was going, and promptly stepped on one of these toads...or whatever they are.  He then proceeded to scoop said toad up with a shovel, and toss it on to the front lawn.  Before he could get a bag to put it in, a vulture swooped down and grabbed it.     Let's see, the night before he nearly hit a deer on the little rural road we have that leads to our little area.  Maybe I should post about that.  I think it would be called   "Why I have a deer whistle on my bumper."    I could probably do it in 60 words or less.   My lunch with fourth graders   Yesterday, I went to have lunch with my eldest at her school.  I try to alternate weeks for this.  One week, one child, and the next week, the other one.  They both really love it when I do, and their school isn't all that far away from the base, so it makes it easy.   So, as I was having lunch with my eldest and her classmates, they started to tell me all of their jokes.  For those of you who have been around kids that age, you know the kind I mean.  Most of them are really bad.    Well, one particularly friendly girl who was sitting across from me, proceeded to tell me a joke that apparently hand gotten around the class.  I noticed that the kids were all watching me closely, so I figured I was going to have to closely guard my reaction.  After all, I'm a cool mom, or so they tell me.   The joke:   An elementary teacher was in her classroom, when one of her students walked in late.   Teacher:   Why are you late?  Student:   I was on top of Cherry Hill   Author's note:  You would think that, being a former child, I would have guessed what was going to happen.   Then, another boy walked in late.   Teacher:   Why are you late?  Student:   I was on top of Cherry Hill  As she proceeded to teach the class, a girl who she didn't recognize, walked into the classroom.   Teacher:   Hi there.  I don't think I've ever seen you before.  What is your name?  Girl:   Cherry Hill  My first reaction was much the same as yours, but I hid it well and laughed with the rest of them.  In the beginning, I really didn't know how to handle it but two things came to my mind.    1)  They probably had NO clue as to what the whole thing meant. 2)  I told the very same type of jokes when I was that age.  And on that note, I'll sign off and go get some lunch.  I've got some work to do around the house, and some boxes to empty.  I'm just hoping that there aren't any toads in them.

       ***The fish saga continues***   He lives!  When I woke up this morning I was almost hesitant to go and check on the fish, but Rags was still alive and looking active.  There are still spots on him but I'm hoping after a few days treatment, he'll get rid of them and be on the path to recovery.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed but time will tell.   ~~~Today's Agenda~~~     Take shower Unpack more boxes Go to grocery store Take oldest to doctor     .....and not necessarily in that order.  I live the exciting life!   My oldest developed a cough a couple of weeks ago.  Just when I was about ready to take her into the doctor, it seemed to get better.  Then the next day she woke up with a roaring cold, poor kid.  This time, I'm not waiting.  Hopefully, the doctor can give her something that will help her get better.  I don't like to dive into antibiotics, but this has gone on for far too long.  First the cough, and now this.  I don't want it to get worse.   ***Reading Private Messages***   I've been following a debate over on a vB board regarding the legality of admins reading private messages on forums for a while now. It comes at an interesting time.  As you may or may not know, I'm an active participant in  urlLink distributed computing.   I'm a member of what I consider to be one of the best  urlLink teams   around.  I'm an administrator there, and also help out on a few different boards that are not DC related, including my own.  In some discussions with some other administrators, it was divulged that there were some owner/admins of a certain DC forum that regularly practiced reading of private messages.  As I've had dealings with this team in the past, I must say that this bit of information did not come as a complete surprise to me.  We all agreed that reading someone's private messages was not a practice that we believed in.   The question is this.  Do the owners/admins of a forum have the right to read PMs?  Is there a particular reason for them to do so?  Did the members pose a threat?  Were they planning something that would harm the forums or the team?  In this particular instance, no.  It was believed that it was brought on by sheer paranoia, mixed in with a cupful of needing to have complete control.  Granted, the legalities of the issue are somewhat gray, but, it's not a practice that is looked favorably upon.  It's been a pretty hot topic among a few of us lately and a very interesting one to study.  Here is something written by an IT manager on the subject:     I have been an IT tech and manager for over 20 years and have had to design systems to comply with the law.  (3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection,a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public shall not intentionally divulge the contents of any communication other than one to such person or entity, or an agent thereof) while in transmission on that service to any person or entity other than an addressee or intended recipient of such communication or an agent of such addressee or intended recipient.  (b) A person or entity providing electronic communication service to the public may divulge the contents of any such communication -  (i) as otherwise authorized in section 2511(2)(a)or 2517 of this title;  (ii) with the lawful consent of the originator or any addressee or intended recipient of such communication;  (iii) to a person employed or authorized, or whose facilities are used, to forward such communication to its destination; or  (iv) which were inadvertently obtained by the service provider and which appear to pertain to the commission of a crime, if such divulgence is made to a law enforcement agency.  (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection or in subsection (5), whoever violates subsection (1) of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.  It doesn't get any clearer than that, folks. In the US, installing and using this hack is a federal offense that can earn you prison time.  Here is the  urlLink law.    It also bears mentioning that individual states also have privacy laws that may or many not be violated by reading your users' private messages. One would also be subject to prosecution under state laws as well.  Given the privacy concerns relative to the Patriot Act, this is an extremely sensitive issue to many people.  I have no further need to continue to try to convince anyone further. I've given you the best advice I can. If you choose to do something stupid and put yourself at risk, that's your business.      Definitely gives you something to think about.  Of course, many people are of the belief that nothing is private on the internet, which, logically speaking, is true.  If an administrator is going to read your private messages, does he/she need to warn you of the fact when you register?  Would you be safe if you just changed the title to "Messages."  And now...a look at it from a lawyers point of view.....     He may not be a lawyer, but I am. Of course this requires me to say we are not in an attorney client relationship, I am offering generalized advice, it is worth what you paid for it, yadda yadda.  I've actually been watching this debate for a while. Find it pretty interesting.   All I can say is this, and you'll pardon me if my tone is blunt.   There are some recent cases that might suggest that this could be a violation of the act in question. Normally the cases involve reading other people's emails or putting key caps programs on people's computers without their permission or knowledge. If people believe, reasonably, that their private messages are private, you could have a problem.   Now a lot of you will say they don't reasonably believe that, nothing on the Internet is private. My response is you need to take a look at the type of people who use your site. Are they aware enough to appreciate this fact? A court will look at what is reasonable based upon the knowledge base of the people. So if you have a hacking board or something your argument is a good one. Not so good for a board where the people don't know the first thing about vbulletin, how it works, what can be read, so on and so forth.   Yes, we can view the PMs by going through the databases. Sysadmins can also view emails easily. And without proper cause, if a sysadmin for an email provider started reading your email, he'd be liable for all sorts of things. It's a definite no no. Once you place something out there for people to use it becomes more complicated then it is my property so tough to you. And if you had a problem and you went into court and said hey, it is my board, it is my property I can do what I want, I promise you that answer won't cut it.   On the other hand, if you can say, I had a problem with a stalker or with someone trading warez, and I had a note on my sign up page that said you are consenting to being monitored with just cause, then you have a very good argument. Is it a winnable argument? Honestly, I don't know. Any more then I know for certain you would be found liable for violating the Act(s).  In the end, I'd suggest that if you want to install this hack and you want to protect yourselves, it probably wouldn't hurt to put something in your TOS noting that they are consenting to monitoring or that nothing posted through the board is private or what have you. It is not a difficult thing to put in your TOS and it is better to be safe. I would also be very careful to limit your reading of pms to when it is a necessity.  Of course, this only applies to US law. The EU has even more stringent privacy laws. Your mileage my vary.  By the way, if you are wondering if I, as an attorney, would ever install this hack, the answer is no. I think it is unwise, and I think, as our IT person thinks, that it could get you in a lot of trouble, even with warnings to the users.      It's an interesting topic that bears some serious thought.  It's not a practice that I believe in myself, but then again, it's my choice.  Any thoughts?????

       Sand gnats   I'm not sure which is worse, toads or sand gnats.  I was outside with the kids a lot yesterday, as well as the neighbors and they came out in droves.  Today, I have little red dots all over the place that itch from time to time.  I suppose I'll get used to it.  I've learned that Off is my friend...Even though I do smell like a chemical plant when I have it on.  Hey, I really don't care what I smell like, as long as I can keep the biting under control.   Electric fences and escaping dogs   We have a four-legged escape artist living in our midst.  You can often hear in our house   "close the door"   or   "Tiny, BACK!!!!.    We ordered an electric fence that will help keep the dog from digging under the one we have in the back yard, as well as keep her in our back yard which does not have a fence.  A few of our neighbors have them, and the swear by them.  They have also said that they will help my husband install it.  Now, Tiny is a great dog but there are times I wonder if she has a brain.  Maybe she has one, but I believe she is afraid to use it.  With my luck, the dog will ignore the shocks and just run right across the street to visit her buddies.     I feel like chili tonight   I've got to get a pot of chili going in the crockpot as it seems we are having our neighbors over for dinner.  One of the main problems is that this state does not have the same ingredients that I used when I was in California.  Now, I need to create a new recipe.  I'm hoping that it all works out.  I imagine it will.   I think I worry too much.   The china hutch is in!   We finally got our china hutch in this week, and it's been sitting there empty ever since.  This really irks me as I've got all kinds of things that I want to put in there.  So, after I get the chili going, I'm going to be doing a lot of unpacking...weeeeeee!  I think it's going to be a lot like Christmas.    Mood:  Motivational     Background Noise:  Kids playing

         By DAVID CRARY, AP National Writer   BOSTON - With gays and lesbians now legally wed in Massachusetts, foes of gay marriage vowed Tuesday to campaign hard, in state and national elections, for candidates willing to reverse the tide.       Uhhh...why do you want to reverse it?  California does it (ok, maybe that wasn't a good example).  I guess I really just don't get it.  Ok, I know what the definition of marriage is.  But why is that "set in stone?"  Why can't gay couples get married?  Why can't they have the right to insurance and all of the other benefits that heterosexual couples have?  And that brings up another sore spot for me.  Why can't they be considered good candiates as parents, through adoption or other means?  Society tends to think of homosexuals as perverts.  If they do that behind closed doors, what will they do to the children?  Oh for God's sake people!  Wake up and smell the bacon.  They are human's just like us, capable of love, albeit of the opposite sex.  Ok, I don't get it, but I don't begrudge them the right to love someone of the same sex.  There are "bad" people out there everywhere, be it a homosexual or heterosexual.     "Homosexual couples are not the enemy," said Raymond Flynn, a former Boston mayor and foe of gay marriage. "The enemy is the legislators who ignored and betrayed the people of Massachusetts by not giving them an opportunity to express their point of view."        Yeah right Mr. Flynn.  Why not take a look around you?  I would imagine that a large majority of the folks don't really have a problem with it, but probably don't want to admit it.  Most likely, it upsets your masculinity, you moron.  If you look at the politicians who are fighting the hardest against it, you'll find the one's who are coming up for re-election.  Whooo..did I tell you your nose was a lovely shade of brown?     Legislators wrangled for months after the state Supreme Judicial Court, in a 4-3 decision last November, ruled that gay couples were entitled to marry. Eventually, in a compromise that dismayed activists on each side, lawmakers took the first step toward letting voters decide in 2006 if they want to amend the constitution to ban gay marriages and allow gay couples enter civil unions.        Actually, I think letting the people vote is a good thing.  It might suprise alot of people.       "President Bush needs to do more than make a public statement," Staver said. "He should appoint a pro-marriage advocate to his staff whose sole job is to push forward a constitutional amendment ... to educate, motivate and direct the strategy."        No shit Sherlock.  Let's get on with it.    Mood:  Chip on shoulder     Background Noise:  Kidz Bop

      Why is there day to day coverage on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, but very little of the senseless, horrific, despicable (stop men when I've gone to far) beheading of Nicholas Berg?  When will this stop?    After seeing two video files last night of Mr. Berg being beheaded by terrorist kidnappers I'm hardly surprised that President Bush has removed the kid gloves (I won't hold my breath about this though)!  The fight in Iraq is dirty.  Terrorism does not make for a tidy, unsoiled war (kind of an oxymoron isn't it?).  Lets face it.  Whenever a country is occupied, there will always be factions that will fight for the power themselves, and that doesn't necessarily coincide with what is best for the country.  Leaving Iraq in the hands of these fanatics would be a disaster for everybody.  It is probable that the Middle East would eventually be under their leadership (think oil).  Do we really want to have a super-power with such a hatred of American's?  It's time for Bush to stand up and take action. He needs to stop choosing his targets so carefully.  It's time to jump in and take control of this situation completely.  How many more innocent people will die before this all stops?     Mood:  Grumpy     Background Noise:  Silence

They are the kind that could do some serious damage to the foot/ankle area if you stepped on one and didn't know they were there.  I originally thought there were put there by our fearless, insect stalking, toad eating dog.  Turns out, I was wrong.  They are from Armadillos.

      I wish I would have gotten a picture of it.  You too, can have an alligator in your "back yard."  Just come visit me and I'll show you how.    This weekend, we were in our backyard on our deck, enjoying a peaceful evening.  One of the terrorists was spending the night with a friend, and one was sleeping peacefully, well, until later, but that's a different story.  While we were there, we noticed a truck in off to the side of our privacy fence in the backyard, and then watched as someone came up behind our fence, shining a flashlight.  The other half, being naturally concerned/bothered/curious, took a flashlight and went to the back fence.  The "body" on the other side said (I kid you not) "it's ok, I'm just looking for an alligator."  My immediate thought was this guy was on some really good drugs (can I have some?), or he was one sandwich short of a picnic basket (probably because of all the drugs he took during they height of Woodstock days gone by).   Fast forward... Turns out, someone across the pond (it's behind our fence), had called 911 to report an alligator.  To make a long story short, we watched a couple of men climb into a boat, and search for the alligator, then catch it.  What was really neat was after they properly secured him, one of the men climbed on to shore and carried the alligator over to us so we could see it.  The gator was about 3 1/2 feet long (from head to foot) and the colors on it were absolutely stunning.  We got to touch it, and I was amazed at how soft its skin was.  They were going to relocate it, most likely taking it back to it's mom.  All in all, it was a great thing to experience.  I've only ever seen them in a zoo or a farm, so to see one up close an personal (albeit a small one) was a fascinating experience for me.

      Ok, it's been a while and I'm not sure where to start.  Guess I should get the normal stuff out of the way first.  The kids are doing great.  Only five more days of school, but I'm not counting or anything.  They are really keyed up and excited.  Not that you can tell of course.  They remind me of little Mexican jumping beans...bouncy, bouncy, bouncy....  Work is great.  We just went through the proposal season which always promises long hours, and this was no exception.  It was my first time through at actually writing them, and I enjoyed it but could have done without the stress that went along with it.  I have to admit, though I wouldn't say this out loud, it's really and exciting time and you feel as if you are part of a team.  The bad part was, not really being able to spend a lot of time with the kids.    The dog, well...she's great.  Ok, damnit...she is an IDIOT.  She stalks and eats any insect this side of the equator, and let me tell you....there are a lot of them here.  I lost my bicycle to one of those bumblebees.  You know the one's I'm talking about.  They are about the size of a softball, and you need a baseball bat or a Glock to fend them off.  The damn thing picked it up by the rear tire.  I figure it was bringing it home to his son for a birthday present.  And don't even get me started about toads!  She eats them, and then has the audacity to come up to me, mouth foaming, and giving me that questioning look..."Mommy, will you please wipe my chin."   Twinkle, Dude Jr. and Rags are still with us.  Twinkle was definitely "iffy" for a couple of days.  I cleaned out her tank and thoroughly sterilized it, and put all the necessary chemicals in as well.  He seems to be making a come back but it was questionable there for a few days.  Since I've moved, I've revamped the site a bit.  This time with my graphics.  I'll be adding more as time goes on.

         Emboldened by a recent court ruling in his favor, Lindows CEO Michael Robertson is calling on Microsoft to compete with his company in the marketplace, not in the courtroom. "Bill [Gates], I don't want your $1158," Robertson wrote in an open letter to Microsoft that he posted on Lindows' Web site yesterday, alluding to the fee a Dutch judge required Microsoft to pay Lindows. "I just want a chance to compete and grow my company. If you can think back to when you started Microsoft, sure there were big companies like IBM, but they didn't use the ruthless tactics that Microsoft now employs. How could you have built your company in that kind of environment?"      I wonder how this will all turn out?  I wonder if Lindows will be able to make it?  I know what Microsoft has done in the past (obliterate the competition), but one day, the gorilla must fall.  It will be interesting to see if Mr. Robertson will be the one to do it.

      By Paul Thurrott: thurrott@winnetmag.com   An often irreverent look at some of the week's other news...    Here Comes Microsoft's EU Appeal  Next week, Microsoft will likely issue its appeal of the European Union (EU) decision that labeled the company a monopoly that abuses its power and harms the media-player and server markets. The company is expected to ask the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg to suspend the sanctions that the EU's March decision imposed. And if you were worried about the differences between US and European court systems, fear not; they have one major similarity. Although a European court hearing on the sanctions suspension should happen in a mere couple of months, Microsoft's entire appeals process will probably drag on for years. Ah, you can just smell the fresh scent of justice in the air, can't you?   Microsoft: Brazil's Use of Linux Is Making the Country 'Irrelevant'  The president of Microsoft Brazil fretted this week that his country's decision to adopt Linux for use in public-use computers will set back Brazil for years. "If the country closes itself off again as it did when it protected its information technology, 10 years from now we will wake up and be dominant in something insignificant," Emilio Umeoka said this week. "Irrelevance is the beginning of the end." Umeoka is referring to a decision Brazil made 20 years ago to protect its IT sector with high tariffs, a decision that cost the country dearly because it couldn't attract foreign investment during a time that should have been high growth. "I don't know if this is the best way to attract investment into the country," he said. "I know this is not the best way to create a base of development from which to export because there's no revenue from something that's free." Umeoka said that the Brazilian government's decision won't hurt Microsoft's sales in the country; he's just concerned that Brazil will miss out on yet another enormous economic opportunity.   Intel Expects Better Revenues in Current Quarter  This week, microprocessor giant Intel revised its earnings forecast for the current quarter, alerting investors that its earnings will be higher than previously anticipated. The reason? Intel is experiencing higher-than-expected demand for the flash memory chips that manufacturers use in cell phones. Meanwhile, demand for Intel's microprocessors remains in line with its earlier estimates, the company said.    Intel Preps New 64-Bit Pentium 4 Chips  And speaking of Intel, the chipmaker will soon unleash a bevy of new PC microprocessors, including the long-awaited 64-bit version of its best-selling Pentium 4 processor. Five of the upcoming chips, which are part of the Prescott family of Pentium 4 processors, will debut June 21 alongside new chip sets and will feature speeds ranging from 2.8GHz to 3.6GHz. Later in the summer, Intel will release three other new Pentium 4 processors, which will include the 64-bit extensions; those chips will run at 3.6GHz, 3.4GHz, and 3.2GHz and will initially target the workstation market. Intel says it will also ship 64-bit-enabled versions of its Xeon processors sometime this summer. All of Intel's 64-bit Pentium 4 and Xeon chips will support the so-called No Execute (NX) processor technology, which works in tandem with a software feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) to pervasively prevent buffer-overrun errors, which attackers often use to compromise Windows machines.   Microsoft Scraps Another Game  In another strange setback for Microsoft's gaming plans, the company said this week that it has instructed game-maker LEVEL-5 to cancel production of "True Fantasy Live Online," an eagerly awaited Xbox title that's been perpetually delayed since it was first announced more than 2 years ago. Stating that it can't deliver gamers a "novel" experience with the title, Microsoft finally decided to pull the plug. "True Fantasy Live Online" was intended for the Japanese market and would have been the first Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) for the Xbox. Earlier this year, Microsoft canceled its entire 2004 lineup of XSN Sports titles, citing an inability to compete with market-leader Electronic Arts (EA). EA, perhaps not coincidentally, then unexpectedly announced that it will support Microsoft's Xbox Live online gaming service, reversing an earlier decision to ignore the service.   AOL Settles with Former Subscribers  Everybody's favorite online service for newbies announced this week that it's settling a class-action lawsuit with a group of former subscribers who complained that their subscriptions were canceled for no reason. AOL, now the smallest province in the Time Warner empire, denied liability in the case and was able to settle for an undisclosed amount. Presumably, the former subscribers have been without Internet access for the duration, but I'm sure AOL would be happy to give them back their old screen names, which no doubt include references to favorite pets and TV sitcom characters. Somehow, everything is right with the world again.   SCO Is at It Again, Seeks More IBM Code  This story would be funny if it weren't so sad. After spending more than 2 months reviewing the AIX source code that IBM supplied, litigation-loving SCO Group is apparently having trouble finding all those examples of stolen source code (similar, I suppose, to the problems that the United States has had finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq) that it complained about in its $1 billion lawsuit against IBM. So SCO is ... get this ... asking the court to require IBM to give SCO even more source code so it can keep looking. Now, I'm not a legal expert, but shouldn't SCO put up or shut up? And remind me again: What, exactly, is the penalty for mounting a frivolous lawsuit in this country?   DOJ vs. Oracle: Now It's Ellison's Turn  On Monday, database giant Oracle will face off against the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in a federal court in San Francisco during the opening of a lawsuit designed to prevent Oracle's hostile takeover of PeopleSoft. But unlike a certain other lawsuit involving a huge software company and the DOJ, this case is expected to conclude fairly quickly. Each side gets 2 weeks to present its case, and a verdict is expected shortly thereafter. The DOJ is going to argue that an Oracle takeover of PoepleSoft will leave the market with only two companies--Oracle and SAP--that supply the high-end human resources and financial-management software that enterprises use to run their businesses. Presumably, Oracle will argue that, if it had its way, only one supplier of such software would exist. And Oracle CEO Larry Ellison would be the richest man in the world.   Microsoft Announces "Does Your Code Think In Ink?" Contest Winners  This week, Microsoft announced that the winner of its "Does Your Code Think In Ink?" contest, which rewarded innovative software design for the Tablet PC, is Philip Lanier.

      That I tackle the rest of those boxes!  No, really I mean it.  I'll be doing alot of work around the house today.  Lots of pickup and unpacking.  My goal is to get, at the very minimum, one car in the garage.  The hope is for both of them, but I'm not adverse to take small steps.  I've got plans for the basic primer white that the previous owners left on the walls, and now that I do, I'm raring to go.  I've also got alot of work to do on the yard, but I don't want to get too far ahead of myself.  Life is good.  The kids are happy.  Other half got a sreening interview with the company I work at.  Hey, even if nothing comes of it, it's a bite.  He also has a possiblity at another job.  Got released from having to go back to the doctor for an entire month.    Things are looking up.  It's definitely good to be me.    Mood:  Content     Background Noise:  Blissful Silence
