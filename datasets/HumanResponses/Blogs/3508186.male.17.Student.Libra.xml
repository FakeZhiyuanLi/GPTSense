      Well, it's 5:10 and I'm tired.  I went to bed at 2:30 this morning, woke up at 12:30 and cleaned Jen and Justin's cars (Jen is my sister and Justin her bf).  Then I ate lunch, did the dishes, and chatted with Kassandra (Bernard) for awhile.  Like I said, I'm tired, but I so wanna do something today.  I guess I'll have to call Josh and see what he's up to.  Maybe he's at work.  Can't remember.  I'll post some pics of my peeps as soon as I figure out how to work Hello.

      Well, it's been awhile and I thought I'd post my recent happenings.  The same stuff has been happening, playin video games, shootin pool, hangin with friends, ya know.  Also chattin with people, some chicks from Muskogee.  I hooked Josh up with one and we may make a trip over there this week.  I've also been chatting with the chick there too, she seems cool, maybe I'll meet her sometime.  Well, gotta go, peace.

      Well, Kassandra broke it off.  She says she likes us better as friends.  I think she just finds the other Jon a better bf.  But, that may not be the reason, if it is, that's just jacked.  I was having a great time with her, and I thought she was having fun with me.  But Jon and her must have more things in common.  I guess I'm stuck with Moony, I probably wont bitch as much though, lol.  No offense Moony, I know how you fell, somewhat.

      My glowsticks have arrived!  All 100 of them, 8" long and ready to glow, haha.  I think 100 glowsticks for 13 bucks is a great deal.  So far I've tried out a green and a blue.  They seem bright in the day so at night we're gonna have way too much fun with them.  Well, gotta go eat breakfast.  Peace

      Well, we played pool, and played pool, and again played pool.  In between Josh and I went to Walmart and he bought NBA Street Vol. 2.  It's bad ass!  We've been playin for awhile now, it's fun.  Well, I gotta get back to the usual.  Maybe Kassandra will get online and chat, if not I'll catch her before I leave for Barnsdall tomorrow.

      Man, it has been a slow day today.  It's only 5 and it seems like it should be 10.  Right when we got back from Pockets we ended up goin to the Cue Bowl and shooting pool there for 2 hours.  It was fun, I won alot more than I thought I would.  Well, time to sit back and relax, eat some food and watch some tv.  Peace

      Wow, my mood has totally changed since before.  I thought the night was over but Josh and Chris showed back up.  Now we're playin some more NFS.  I dont know why my mood in the previous post was so crap for crap.  I took some time to think and clear my mind and now everything should be back to normal.  Kassandra left me all alone so I guess it means it's close to brief hibernation (sleep).  Well, rest on a settled mind is always good.  Hopefully Kassandra wont be busy tomorrow and maybe I can hang out with her at her place.  That'd be cool.  Well, peace.

      Wow, summer just keeps clicking away.  It seems like there is alot left but then again it seems like I'm running out.  I want fun things to come quickly, like the 5th of July and of course visiting Montana.    Sometimes it seems like I have alot of fun everyday, but then everyone leaves and it's sad again, or somewhat sad, that's when I relize summer is going by and I cant stop it.  I can however make the best of it.  But am I making the best of it?  Could I be doing things differently?  Everytime something happens I look back right away and wonder if my input would have changed the outcome?  I know that the good things in my life never last, and that tears me apart.  I hope I have changed and that the good wont go away.  Life is what it is, trial and error, pain and anguish.  Sometimes it goes good, but you really have to try.  I must be failing to try, but I have what I want, or need.    I dont mean to make these posts so damn despairing but Hoobastanks music is entering my mind and twisting my thoughts.  I feel the songs are a part of me, but I guess that's how all music is to everyone.  I just think the members of that band must just go through alot, but then I see everyone else going through the same and I realize we all are very similiar.  Some go through life getting and having exactly what they want, but maybe I'm greedy.  Maybe that's why I see them as having no problems, just because I'm not them and I dont see the rough parts of it.  I dont know exactly, and I may never.    I hope nothing jolts my ever so fragile life into an uncontrolable mess.  My biggest fear is having to spend the rest of my schooling in Montana, at some crap for crap high school with people I dont know.  Kinda like how it was here before I became so attached to my friends.  I still see my friends from Montana as my friends, but the two worlds are so far apart it sometimes makes me sad.  Forget that, I dont get sad too often, and thinking about it now just isnt good.    Uhh, where do I end?  The music is again here, knocking at my head and my thoughts and it feels as though I need to sing them aloud on every rooftop everywhere.  Disappear, if only life was like this, the lyrics seem so right, but is it like this for anyone at all?  Lucky, another one that wraps around my mind.  And of course the one song I listen to the most, Unaffected.  Hopefully I'm not going insane sitting here in an empty house waiting for a soul to approach my doorstep, hoping for the right one, but only recieving unexpected visitors.    Ohh well, this must now come to an end, I've written too much and I need communication.  Kassandra has stepped outside, hopefully she will return in an honest amount of time.  As always, peace.

      Well, our first relationship activity.  Ha, that sounds funny.  Kassandra came over tonight and I had a blast.  It was only for a few hours but it was worth it.  It seems I'm entering a new relationship, as well as a new way of going by things.  I like this alot, and I'm sure it will last.  I havent felt this excited about someone in a long time, and that gives me huge amounts of hope.  Well, my eyes are starting to hurt due to this bright screen so I'm gonna end this.  Peace

      I feel so relieved, happy, and clear.  My mind is optimistic and nothing can hold me back.  All I wanna do now is sit back and relax.  I do have responsibilities, and more may have been added, but I feel I can tackle them even better now.    I now know the new has past problems that are very important and stressful.  I can help make it past the obstacles and help clear anything away.  At least I hope I can.  Only time will tell, only hearts will prosper, only minds will be challenged.

      Well, today went alot better than yesterday (except for the mistrial) and I feel better.  It could be better but sometimes things dont work out like you want them to.  So I went to play some pool (fun fun fun) lost some games, won some games, not my biggest night.  Then some friends and I hung out in my yard and chilled.  It was fun, boring, whatever.  Well, busy now....

      So I went to the beginning of the trial.  Went good, I guess.  But they had a mistrial.  Andrea's dad said something about the case in earshot of a juror so now the trial is set for November 15th.  It totally sucks.  Well, gotta jack with my video card.

      Uhh, I feel so sad, yet so happy.  I know not what I should do.  Too many things flying through my head, big and small.  I just want everything to be the best it can.  If only I knew how to make things the way I see them in my head.  I know it's a reality yet it seems so far away.  Not to worry though, everything should be alright.  I figured I'd be really happy that my video card is here, but it's only out of its package, and I havent even opened the VGA Silencer.  I just wish things were easier.  I look at one thing or think about it and it's so positive, then I see another and things go downhill.  I'm really not a sad person, that's why I'm worried.  Something has changed, hopefully for the better.  I think tomorrow will be better, but only if things go my way.

      I just got home from an entire day at court.  1230 to 600.  I learned alot about the accident that killed our friend and I'll learn alot more in the days to come.  If the girl accused of vehicular manslaughter is found guilty it will be a minimum of 4 years in prison.  Only time will tell, I think it's supposed to be over on Thursday.  Well, I'm gonna see what Josh is doing and then the dishes.......

      I am now enlightened.  It would seem I talk to Kassandra way too much.  Hours pass talking and information as the human mind sees it is exchanged.  She has effected me and I am now expressing that effect.    The world seems open, far to wide for one person to matter.  I see everyday people doing everyday things and I wonder if I'll ever talk to them, or influence them at all.  Then I look back on all my friends, how I did or did not effect them as individuals.  Some were just fake friends, people who saw me every once in awhile and thought they were my friend.  I guess I was their friend, if it mattered at all.  The term friend seems like it descibes people you know when it should be used to describe people you effect.  There is so many people in this world that it seems hard to change the lives of just a few.  I'm glad for my friends, past and present that have jumped in my life and stayed awhile or departed soon after.    Departed sounds like death, so I'll try not to use it so much for that.     Well, I discused many things with Kassandra, one of which was seeing into the future.  If I could see I could changed it for the better.  But that may turn to the worst (Butterfly Effect) and end up horrible.  What I was mostly focusing on was relationships.  To think that one person dates another, and then moves on.  It seems like this is not the way things should be.  It seems that God had a plan, and now it's ruined.  It's almost like he wanted to see how far we could go, only to find out his way of our existence and procreation has been lusted apon and dragged through hell.  So my main reason for wanting to know the future is to know how things or relationships will turn out, will they be happy with the occasional mishap, or will it end and be looked apon as a mistake.  Should I know, do I really want to know.  I have thought about it and I dont care.  I will do my best to figure things out.  I will try.

      Wow, Kassandra, who else would read my lame blog?  I think many a few know of its existence.  So this is pretty much a yahoo chat that takes longer to send.  Or something like that.  Well now that you know it's here, I have to be careful what I write, or do I?

      It seems that after reading Kassandra's Blog mine is lame.  She has meaningful stuff to talk about, when mine is empty, wanting a new way, a new beginning, like a first impression all over again.  I really need more of her to rub off on me, then maybe I and this blog could be much happier, lol.

      Wow, it has been awhile and many things have changed.  I got my first hair (not important) and went to another LAN.  My damn 9600xt was and is still in the mail (arrives today before 430) so I had to borrow a friends.  He let me borrow it til I got my new one so I've been playing hours of Call of Duty online.  It is so fun.  Well, now I'm catching up with Kassandra so I'd better go, peace out.

      Alright, something bad is gonna happen.&nbsp; I've been having way too much fun with friends.&nbsp; Hopefully everything goes cool in Montana and I have a great time.  Well, I've been playing a ton of games and having a blast.&nbsp; Josh, Sean and Bernard have been coming over to play Mario Kart Double Dash for the past few nights and believe you me it's bad ass.&nbsp; It's been fun but I can think of better ways to spend all this time.&nbsp; I havent called Tosha in awhile and now she lives somewhat closer and I'd like to hang out with her like I have in the past.&nbsp; But I really dont wanna sleep with her, it would be kinda fucked up.&nbsp; She's too wild for me, yet I still wanna "hang out" with her.&nbsp;   This whole girl thing is startin to make me mad, I dont know why but it seems like I need a relationship to survive.&nbsp; That must mean that I'm weak or something, or some kinda loser, lol.&nbsp; Fuck it, whatever comes comes I just hope it's for the best.&nbsp; Pe-ace bit-chas!

      Well, I had an unexpected morning.&nbsp; Yesterday Jen metioned something about her wanting me to go with her to Muskogee.&nbsp; I said I'd think about it and that's all.&nbsp; So I woke up, ate some cereal and was sitting in the livingroom and she came in asking if I were ready to go.&nbsp; Of course I was like "I dont wanna go" cause she just wanted to get something real quick and that to me is boring.&nbsp; So she gets up all pissed and tells me I cant go out for the rest of the time we're here which is like a whole week.&nbsp; I got up all pissed and was like. "Whatever, I'm not listening to you!"  So, like many of our other fights go down she starts yellin about me going back to Montana.&nbsp; She is so damn lazy and selfish it's rediculous.&nbsp; She makes Justin and I do stuff for her that is totally stupid.&nbsp; Yesterday she had me get the lawn chair outta the trunk of her car for her, only to bitch at me for not setting it up when she was right there and could do it herself.&nbsp; To me that is laziness at its best.&nbsp; Well, back to the subject, she starts tellin me that I need to call dad and that she cant take it another year ...blah blah blah....I dont really fucking care anymore.&nbsp; She has threatened me so much with that, uuhhhh, I fuckin hate it.&nbsp; So she left for Muskogee by herself.&nbsp; Before hand she was sayin we get into fights every other conversation we have.&nbsp; Now that's an over-exaggeration, we havnt gotten into a fight all summer.&nbsp; She is full of crap it burns her eyes.&nbsp; Well, I'm sick of this writing crap, peace.

      Well, I rode my bike to Kassandra's house to hang out with her.&nbsp; It was damn tiring but I needed to get some exercise anyhow.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So I stayed over there for awhile, and Josh got online.&nbsp; I pretended to be Kassandra and invited him over.&nbsp; When he came and knocked on&nbsp;the door she grabbed him and I came up behind him saying, "ohh baby ohh baby."&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Then we sat around there talking for a few hours.&nbsp; It sounds boring, but ya know, I like to make people laugh and I love to talk so it's always fun for me.&nbsp; I think Josh likes Kassandra some but I asked her and she said only&nbsp;liked him&nbsp;as a friend.&nbsp; Well, I did ask her if I could trust her when she was hangin out with Jon and look what happened.&nbsp; This time I&nbsp;believe her though.&nbsp; Plus Josh is really hitting it off with a girl from Muskogee.&nbsp;&nbsp;We met her at the Gameroom there&nbsp;a few weeks back.&nbsp; She seems cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I&nbsp;told myself that I wouldnt wanna go back out with&nbsp;Kassandra after what she did but now I see her again and I want her back.&nbsp; I know it shouldnt happen but how am I gonna fight myself.&nbsp; Anyhow, she still wants Jon back and I guess I cant change people so I'll let things go by themselves.&nbsp; Well, this post is nearing an end......yeah, right now.

      Wow, it's been awhile again.&nbsp; It seems I get caught up in such and such and forget I even have a blog.&nbsp; On the latest news, I ate some dog food.&nbsp; Mmm mmm.&nbsp; No, not really, it was kinda good, but it had that, "I know this isnt human food" kinda thought to it. &nbsp; It all started when we went over to Kassandra's house.&nbsp; I was talkin about Zobmondo, she was looking ever so cute in her pajamas, and we decided to go to Walmart and get dog food.&nbsp; Ohh yeah, Josh was there, I seem to have forgotten about him while I was thinking about her, lol.&nbsp; So we bought some dog food, put it on some bread and I took three bites.&nbsp; It took me awhile to chew it up but it soon got to that point and had to go.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Well, it's good to catch up, I think.&nbsp; Peace

      Well, it has been awhile and I havent posted.&nbsp; So the time has come for a recap.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Well, I'm done house sitting, and I've spent all my money except for 3 bucks.&nbsp; I payed Jen 30, bought some shoes, and ate out a few times.&nbsp; Hopefully I can get this video card sold so I can get more money.&nbsp; I talked to my mother and she's gotten another check from the money recieved from selling my grandfathers house.&nbsp; Last time it was 10500, this time it was 4500.&nbsp; So my mom is gonna fix up our old house and rent it out.&nbsp; She also said she was gonna give me some money for clothes and such.&nbsp; That's good news. &nbsp; I'm happy that I'm going to Montana, sad that summer's almost over, happy because things are going somewhat smooth, sad because I'm single.&nbsp; I need to find someone, and I have opportunities, I just dont act apon them.&nbsp; Why cant I have girls fall into my life like they used to.&nbsp; I remember the night Tosha and Lindsey met us cruising.&nbsp; It was awesome, our whole involvement and things we had done are looked back apon as being so far in the past.&nbsp; I hope Tosha moves closer to Tahlequah and I can get in touch with her more.&nbsp;  &nbsp; On the note of girls, Josh, Sean and I were leaving Walmart and there were a van full of girls.&nbsp; We were sitting at the light and one of em leaned out the window and asked what was happenin.&nbsp; Of course we said something like "nothin" or "ehh."&nbsp; We had em follow us to a gas station and we talked for awhile.&nbsp; No spark of convor and the driver had a real bitchy attitude.&nbsp; Out of the three of us (the shyest one) I talked the most.&nbsp; We parted and that was that.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I guess if it wasnt meant to be then it wasnt meant to be.&nbsp; Girls come and go, great girls stay in my life forever.&nbsp;  END  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well, I'm here all alone, since Tuesday til Sunday.  It's not too bad I must say, the buddies are great and the cats are too.  I'm not to disappointed cause I get paid to be here, watch the animals, water the plants, watch tv, and play video games.  Not a bad job at all.  Jen and Justin left earlier today to go back to Tahlequah for work.    The buddies are hard work, they wake me up at 6 am and tire me out playing games.  I like the after time though, when I get em tired, then they take a few hour break.  They are always getting up on the bed when I'm sleeping, and licking my face (not fun).  Well, that's about it for now.  See ya later and peace.

      I just got done catching up on what I missed in Kassandra's blog.  I have to say, her feelings toward everything that has happened with Jon and her the past few days seem awful close if not the same as my feelings towards our relationship.  I was damn furious.  I hated Jon for so long, and I knew it was coming.  Now, I think I know what is coming for her.  I wanna say she deserves it but I know that's not what I want.  I knew the relationship between her and Jon wouldnt and will not last, but I may be wrong.  I mostly think this because everytime I see him he is flirting with girls, always.  In the parking lot of Pockets, with the girl who works and Pockets and yes, even Kassandra, I saw it all three times.  Ohh well, I'll see where this goes, it may last, it may not.  AS THE WORLD TURNS, LOL.......

      Wow, I really love fireworks.  I cant wait til tomorrow.  Josh and Sean are gonna come up with Justin and I to his parents house in Barnsdall for their big 5th of July fireworks display.  It's gonna be bad ass.  Last year, and the 2 before that we started shooting stuff off at 5 or 6 and didnt get done til midnight.  We also get to eat tons of food: hotdogs, hamburgers, potatoe salad, etc.  I've never brought anyone before so this is gonna be real fun.  Last night Josh, Sean and I made some sparkler bombs and blew up a refridgerator.  The bombs were so loud you could hear em so far away.  You could even feel the shock wave!  Well, I gotta go.  Peace out.
