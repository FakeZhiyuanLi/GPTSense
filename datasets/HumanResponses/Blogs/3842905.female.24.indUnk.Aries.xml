      whoaam.... i'm totally hungry, tired and sleepy. I just got a meeting with editor-in-chief. We were talking bout many things. Quite interesting, actually.But when the meeting's over, I feel very tired, sleepy and hungry. Listening to the rock music can give a new power for me, i guess :)

      Well, if there's something I love in this world, that will be my... BOYFRIEND!!! Wow, I love him so much. Eventhough we sometimes get fighting or argue, I will never leave him. I'm truly, madly, deeply in love with him. I think I'm going to marry him soon.

      Well, I voted Amien Rais-Siswono in this morning election. Praise be to God, this couple won at 3 TPS in my neighborhood. Hope it will be the good beginning for my country. I've been a huge fan of Amien Rais for long time. So, I wouldn't choose any candidates but him --and his couple of course. Will he win and become president? I don't know. Let's see the result, soon.
