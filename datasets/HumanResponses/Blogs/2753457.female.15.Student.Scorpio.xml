       I think this thing may actually be on Eastern time!  WHOO!  And I may know how to work it better.  WHOO!  I'll be back soon.  Maybe.

       Tomorrow, at last I will see all my lovely loves at school.  I missed you all so.  Very few things have actually worked out over this little break. The weekend was fine.  I was in a really crazy mood for most of it. Monday - Becca's house!  :) Tuesday - No bitches could make it to the casa. Wednesday - Babysat, wasted some baking needs. Thursday - I couldn't go to Chip's house ---sad. (Ha, you ARE in this thing.)  I had a piano lesson, testing my endurance of back pain from sitting up straight. Damn, last night was WEIRD.  I got out of the shower, and I felt suddenly really tired.  So I put my head down (and the rest of me) and I went out.  I slept like a rock for 11.5 hours.  Unfortunately, I had some Big Red in my mouth at the time, and it stayed there all night long.  And I had a really weird dream that I don't remember very well, with Big Red in it.  So, I got up at like 11 the next morning with the most awful taste in my mouth.  Poor teeth.  It felt like there was a hole in my tongue.  Yuck.  Haha, and my journal was on the bed, which was weird.  I slept with my journal.  Anyway, that shit was crazy.  I'm just glad it didn't get on the bed or in my hair. Mary is coming home tonight for the weekend!  YAY!  That should be fun.  She's been laughing at me because Raleigh gets crazy after an inch of snow, and it's like negative 100 degrees in Maine.  I'm glad I don't have to be that cold.  I get grumpy. Hey, does anyone who has Mrs. Krizmanich for English think I should spend my time finishing that short story that we were supposed to have read a week ago?  I probably won't.  But you know something annoying?  I left my planner at school again.  And honestly, I don't remember what the homework for the weekend is.  Ooops.  Hahaha, not a good idea to leave stuff like that out.  Last time I left my planner, Mrs. Carr found it, and it was open to where I had clearly written that school is a hellhole.  Ooops again.  At least it didn't ramble on about how I hate her class.  That would be awkward. Alright, guys, I hope you've enjoyed the products of how bored I've been this week, i.e. these blog entries.  I'll see you all later.

      I cannot believe that they cancelled school again.  I am going crazy.  Goodbye, three day weekends.

       Babysitting is a bitch  Oyyy.  I have got to turn the next job down.  Although I did score some Wendy's out of it, nothing is worth watching other people's children.  Especially on the last snow day of the week (probably), also known as one the more boring points of my life. I just sent Madeline out to get some icy snow to make snow cream.  Joy.  Oh, and my cookies got fucked up.  Wonderful.  I hope snow cream tastes ok with skim milk, ha.  'Cause it's lookin' a little meager in the fridge.  Well, she had trouble scraping it off the trampoline.  I told her to wait until I feel like going outside.  I think she hates me now, and I feel bad.  Ahh, well, she's shut herself in my sister's room with the dogs, so she'll be fine. This thing is depressing, and it shouldn't be because I'm really not that depressed.  I'm just, a little off today, you might say.  As much as it'll kill me to get up at the crack of 6 again, it will be good to be back on some kind of schedule once the ice melts away.  And I missed you all, of course. Becca says that she wonders why people say it never snows here, and she has a point.  It does snow sometimes.  And yet, whenever it does everyone acts like they've never seen it.  I choose to stay inside where it's warm(er.  I'm still cold!) and waste the day eating things and talking online.  And rambling to this stupid thing.  Props if you're still reading it.  You get a gold star. I should go save the dogs from being shut in a small room with a 6-year-old.  They'll thank me.

       I don't know whether to have a get together at the casa.   What if people slip and die on the way there??  No body wants a dead friend.  Geez, I'll probably just be bored again.  Nothing to do.  Of course, homework is out of the question.  No way. Ok, if Kifner has that test the minute we get back I really might cry.  And throw things.  What a stupid moron.  He probably showed up every day this week to greet us, but we weren't there, you ape of a man!!  Ha, I'm so evil to him.  I don't even care.  People are like, "What if that's you one day?"  and I'm like, "Uhh, guys have you met Annie Medlin?  I'll never be a teacher!" Ahh, I'm disappointed about this week's sbemail.  Come on, Chaps.  You can do better than that.  Oy. You know what sucks?  This thing runs on pacific time, that's what.  So add three hours to everything, if you like.  That way you won't be jealous and think that I've slowed time some how. Ok, this thing is getting weird.  So I will leave.

      It snowed today.  Sandy, dry snow.  The kind that squeaks under your feet.  School is closed, which is potentially very good, and also very bad.  I could be bored to tears.  Or I could just be lazy.  There's such a fine line when you're me.  Oy, well, three day weekend is good, especially when it's a double header.  We'll see what kind of mood I'm in.  Ok, I'm out for now.  I'll do another one later, probably. Annie

      Today is the day that begins the rest of them.  So, yeah, I got one of these things.  Check back if you like.  Future posts will probably be longer.  Hope you aren't too disappointed.

       Oh, man. I'm in a really good mood and I don't know why.   I've had randomly nice day. Let me guide you.  Woke up sort of late. Which means that my mom came in and roused me. I was like, "GO AWAY, I HATE YOU." But I got up eventually. Ate a grapefruit and listened to the Beta Band (Is there a the? Hmmm.) and my current favorite song, "I Believe" by Stevie Wonder, while I put on my makeup. Can anyone tell I watched "High Fidelity" yesterday?  The morning passed fairly uneventfully. We sang our pretty little song in chorus class and the trumpet song. Whoo. Ha, I fell asleep in health class. Doubt Peoples noticed. I had some lip gloss on, though, and it got smeared all over my glasses. Gross. When I woke up, I was so confused. I didn't know where or who the hell I was. So, I still really out of it in biology five minutes later. This wasn't good, because I had a test today, and not one that I exactly studied for. I was just like, whoooo, DNA! So, yeah. Lunch was pretty fun. We joked around about how I have a problem with eating children. (Where did this cannibalism come from? I really don't eat kids.) And I tried to carry Zak and dropped him. Ooops. I'm really sorry, Zak! But we're still cool. Does anyone know Zak's first period??  Then in C and C, I BSed my way through our quiz. Ha, we'll see how that shit goes. After Kifner's class, Chance, Sarah and I laughed at him (Kifner, not Chance) and talked about how ugly he is. And that his mom is his wife, and that their children would be born covered with fur (I don't remember what that part was about.) and that people should have a license to show before having kids. HAHA, oh my. Anyway, and now I'm here. I saw a little pizza-like thing in the freezer, so it's baking in the oven. Yay.  And now, I will recite a list of things I love (haha, Sarah):  Every one of my friends, illegal music software, my discman, my bed, good clothes, good shoes, my straightener, coca-cola, movies, music, boys, my glasses, AIM, singing, writing in my rainbow journal from Ashley, some aspects of Enloe, our new tv, uhhhh, what else? That's all I can think of now. I'm really shallow at this moment.  I'm gonna go do stuff.

       Eww, it's Sunday, and I slept really late.  Annie's not getting to bed early tonight.  Oh, well.  I gotta read "Medea" today anyway.  Looks like I should have read that story after all.  Yeah, today's gonna be AWESOME. Last night actually was pretty enjoyable once people got there.  At first it was like, hey guys, we're stupid freshmen.  But it got better; it's always like that.  Even though the idea behind it was a good one, the coat check system sucked.  They didn't even call my number for God's sake.  They just waved my things around until I saw them and took them away.  But yeah, we went to Shabashabu for dinner before Enloe, which is always a rewarding experience for me.  I love that place.  And everyone looked really nice.  I should've done something different with my hair, but it just looked extra straight.  That is, until I got sweaty and gross.  Hanna and I took off our shoes and hid them behind one of the curtains, hahaha.  I have no regrets, other than the sight of my feet afterwards.  Yuck. Well, my mom and sister got back from their eight mile walk (and I'm not even exaggerating or making a pun.  They always do stuff like that.) and wanted me go to Wellspring with them.  I said I had to get started on all my reading, which is kind of true.  I mean, I definitely could have gone, but I didn't want to. Ok, I just realized that it's really cold in here.  Ahhhh, must turn up the heat.  Laters.

       My life is a movie.  I'm not even kidding.  I woke up at noon.  Noon!  How does someone sleep for an hour and a half on a Friday evening, wait till like 1 and then turn around and sleep 11 more hours?  This is surprising even for me.  At like 12:30, I took a shower and got probably the worst shaving cut of my life.  It was awful.  I lost a lot of blood.  Then, right on cue, my mom comes to the house and knocks on the door and is like, "I just came to wish you a happy Valentine's Day.  I brought candy!  Can I come in?"  Oy. Me: "Mom, this is not really a good time." Mom: "Oh, but I wanted to give you your valentine." Me: "Fine!  Come in." (covering myself) Mom: "Ooooh, that's a nasty cut you've got there." Me: "Yeah, yeah, it is." Mom: "You should really be more careful." Me:    Mom: "Oh, but if you elevate it for like ten minutes, I bet it'll be ok." Dad, in the background: "Hey, what time are you supposed to be at your friend's house?"  (Since when was he home???) Mom: "Like 2:30, I think.  I'm picking her up at 4 to go to Shelly Lake." Dad: "You're going to Shelly Lake?" Me, in my head:  AHHHHH, GO AWAY!  This is not the time to bond, over my battle wound.  I'm not even dressed.  I'm fucking dying in here!!!  Why doesn't everyone ever just come on in my bathroom? Mom: "Yeah.  That reminds me, do you have a ride home?" Me: "I don't even know." Mom: "Oh, well, I brought the cell phone, and it's all charged.  I gotta go, I have a hair appointment.  Happy Valentine's Day, love!"  (kisses me on the cheek) Me:           (not returning the sentiment) Then, she closed the door, and I heard her talking to my dad. When she knocked on my door another time, I simply said, "BYE, Mom!" I limped out of the bathroom, put on a cd, and elevated the wound, as my dearest mother suggested.  Not two minutes later, my dad shouts to me, "Hey, when you get a minute, I need your help outside."  Oh, what fresh hell is this? I got up and dressed the wound, and myself, and hobbled outside.  My dad was trying to jump start the Saab from the Toyota. "Just get in the Toyota, and pressure the gas."  Yessir. No such luck, the battery was just too dead.  Can't say I'm surprised.  The poor little Saab has been awfully neglected.  No one ever drives it.  When I told my dad this, he just gave me a look.  XO to you too, Dad. I went back inside, laughing to myself about this whole situation, and how much happened in the hour and a half that I've been awake.  Wow.  I had to save this, and what better way than to share it with everyone on the World Wide Web?  So, I sat down and typed the whole thing.  Wow. Well, I have to get ready to face the rest of the day.

       Happy Valentine's Eve.  Also known as letsseehowmuchsugaranniecaneat day.  But, it was pretty fun, good clean fun.  My clothes were even pinker than they are normally, and you know how pink I get.  My carnation is still in the Fosters water bottle from lunch.  It likes it in there, and perked up considerably during C and C.  I have "The Way You Move" in my head, particularly the part that's like "But I know y'all wanted that 808, can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass, but I know y'all wanted that 808, can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass."  Hahaha, yeah I do. My dad just called to see if I had plans.  I told him not yet.  He wants to have dinner.  Told me to get the chicken out of the freezer and put it in the sink.  Whoooooo, sounds like some bonding time over the grill ensues. I'm reeeeeeally bored.  And tired.  I may go to sleep, to make the time pass more quickly. Ewwww, that awful video from The Darkness that's in space is on Music Television.  Sorry if you like that song, but to me it sounds like a bunch of vocal jumps in a row (a sixth interval, to be precise).  "Touching you-oooo."  Why are they in space anyway?  It's like the "Larger than Life" music video from the Backstreet Boys.  Well, our song has NOTHING to do with being in space, but we love to spend money, so we're gonna be cool robot people at the space station!!  Stupid boy band. Now Cribs is on.  That one's even stupider.  Hey, look!  I'm really rich, and oooh, poor you, you're not.  Oh, well, here's my frivolously huge pool on the roof!  Ughhh, changing the channel right now. Anyone know what the deal is exactly about tomorrow??  I gotta call people about this.  No one's online.  Sad.

       Procrastination never felt so good.  (I won't repeat the famous analogy I usually use about it.  Haha.)  I REALLY need to be reading and studying.  But I'm not at all right now.  It probably wouldn't process much anyway. What really sucks is that they are probably not going to announce a damned thing about the weather and delays and crap until tomorrow.  Watch me show up at school at 7:30 and no one's there.  Ughhhh. Eww, my mouth still tastes like ravioli. Today is Ellen and Mary's 21st birthday.  Every time I wrote today's date on my papers, I thought, awwwww, February 11th.  I cannot even believe that they are that old.  That is unreal to me.  I remember my first day of third grade, when we dropped them off at Enloe for their first day of freshman year.  I remember how old they seemed to me then, to be going to a big scary place with people smoking on the street.  Sigh.  And now they're away and legal drinking age.  15 doesn't seem old anymore.  Ellen and Mary have always seemed older and wiser, because they've always been there.  But the age gap fills now, and 6 years is not very long.  But this is getting way too sentimental. Ok, what does it take to get some good sheet music around here??  Musicnotes.com used to feed me good things, but now it just spits out old big-note digital crap, for stuff like the melody to the Spongebob Squarepants themesong.  That does me so much good.  Most of the stuff I want is obscure little songs, but most of what they have is bubblegum pop music.  Occasionally they'll surprise me with something like "Hey ya."  Not meant to be played on the piano. Ohhhh, my God.  I have to get something done tonight.  Who knows what will happen tomorrow, besides ample excuses to put things off further.  My mother always says that I should stop procrastinating because every time I do it, it deteriorates a little peace of me.  That's the way I used to feel when I'd have to pour my heart and soul into doing everything at the last minute.  But lately, I've just been BSing it anyway at the last minute.  I'm getting realllllly bad about this.

       I'm feeling cold, slightly guilty, and packed away.  I can't feel my arms.  I just made the big move over to the other place.  The place where suddenly I become more shallow, and I start to watch network television.  The place where the majority of my time is spent in the partayy basement of ours.  Well, it's not really, but I kind of like to think so.  I had so much stuff to carry in, though, I really couldn't feel my arms.  I don't want to think about when or how I'm going to unpack my life yet again. Yeah, but I do feel a little guilty.  My mom is really a little pissed off at me, for reasons I won't go into.  It surprised me because for once, it wasn't the other way around, and for once, I can't say I blame her.  I realized that I've been a bitch to her lately, and that she's had quite a shitty time of it.  So, I decided to be nice, and put a smile on my face and a song in my heart, for her sake.  I even fed the dogs and took in the mail before I came here. My dad went to his spanish class (I really think he's trying to change fifty years of being American.  He's taking tango lessons and spanish lessons every week.  Sometimes I question the man's sexuality as well.) tonight, so I'll be home alllll alone.  Wonder if there's anything to eat around here. Well, no matter how much the newfound cable tv tempts me, I WILL NOT watch reality tv.  I actually saw a few minutes of "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance" once.  Really almost threw up afterward.  Oh, my GOD.  Could we sink any further?? Well, I'm really hungry.  If I get bored, I really may come back and write another frickin post.  As sad as that seems to me.

       Back from the trip, really sore.  Ugghh, my brain hurts.  I had to drive most of the way home, which was like 2 and a half hours, because my dad was really tired.  The last part was in traffic.  We went up to Morganton, NC (You might ask where that is.  I have no clue.) yesterday to visit my dad's friend since they were like 5 and his wife, and their dogs.  It was pretty fun--I like them.  Now my neck is sore.  Oh!  But the good news is that I discovered a band that I like, the Dandy Warhols.  My dad had the cd on in the car, and I liked it a lot.  I may have to make a copy. Oh, goodness.  I still have to do my homework tonight.  :(  Oh well, it won't be THAT bad.   I'm so watching the Grammys tonight.  I don't even care if you think I'm stupid.  I actually care about music.  I'll be rooting Coldplay and Outkast on.  And Sigur Ros, whoooo!  Maybe even the White Stripes.  What channel is this shit on anyway?  Ha, that might be good to know.  Because my mom might not get that channel.  I can just see myself three hours from now, all ready to watch, with my popcorn, and my pajamas on, and my homework all done.  And then I can't watch it, and I'm just like fuck.  I'm gonna find out which channel it's on right now. OK, it's reallly on CBS, and we really get that one.  So it's cool.

       Ok, yeah.  I decided to change the template again, 'cause that other crap was just boring me to tears.  Now, it's green and a little of the orange has returned.  And you can see the Radiohead lyrics better.   Hahahahaha, I had a dream about that song the other night.  I was in the Baz Luhrmann version of "Romeo and Juliet."  Well, actually, I was on the set.  And they were filming the elevator makeout scene.  And the way that they filmed it was really cool.  They actually did this in real life, according to the DVD.  They built a little space in a warehouse surrounded by these wooden panels that you can lift up.  They had to keep lifting up each panel of the little space so that they could film inside, and then make sure it was down again so that you wouldn't see the other side when the camera came back around.  This way, you get that spinning effect.  Looked really awesome.  Team effort, 'cause if one person screws up, they have to start over.  Bet Claire Danes didn't mind starting over.  Anyway, wow.  "Talk Show Host" was playing, even though I don't think the song is in that scene, but oh well.  The dream didn't actually revolve around Leonardo DiCaprio.  Only the camera did that.  Oh, my, that was a bad joke. But then, I was at the Capulets' wild little costume gig, and Mercutio was dancing around in drag and singing "Young Hearts."  And that's all I really remember.  God, I LOVE Luhrmann.  Definitely a role model for me. Well, now that I totally bored everyone, I'll pretend to be normal. Ugh, still recovering from the effects of secondhand smoke.  We went to the bowling alley tonight.  I didn't bowl.  But it was still fun.  I split a salad with Becca at Brothers, and then had ice cream at Cream and ('N'?) Bean. Yay, my dad finally burned me the Dandy Warhols cd.  I don't remember what the album is called.  Something about monkeys.  The cover of the cd is pretty sweet.  A banana with a frickin zipper on it, and TDW written somewhere, I can't remember that well. I'm tired, I'm going to sleep.  Maybe I'll have another good dream.  Oooh, if I listen to BDB right before bed, maybe something will happen.  Hope so.

       Hooray for getting out of school for pretty much no reason at all.  Would the world have ended in three more hours?  They all seemed to think so.  Who knows what our lovely school board has cooked up for tomorrow? At this time of the day, normally I would be counting the seconds until I get out of Kifner's class.  But not today.  Oooh, no.  Now I'm just sitting alone, watching old episodes of "Super Secret Movie Rules" or a bunch of crappy music videos in a row.  It will not get warm in here.  I turned up the heat, but I still had to put on my jacket.  Ehnh.  It needs to be warm now. Gasp! Is it snowing again?!  I believe it may be.  Just a little.  Keep coming, keep coming. Yeah, well, it just stopped.  Humphh. Today was not a good day for the glasses.  Shlee and Joncie (I think this was with you guys) suggested I get windshield wipers.  They'd have to be really small.  That would be interesting.  Haha, can't you just see me with little red wipers to match the frames? Dammit, there's no coke here.  And not really enough snow anyway.  I wonder if I could order just a coke for delivery from Domino's.  I don't feel like pizza.  Oh, well, they'd probably charge a lot, the scallywags.  Domino's pizza isn't even very good.  You think it is, and you eat it anyway, and then one day you realize that it's just not all that good.  Eating things because they're there.  Tsk, tsk. Eww, there were so many men in my house last night.  My dad hosted the monthly all male book club meeting, activities including eating spaghetti and drinking wine and being really loud.  :(  The only thing is that I couldn't complain about the noise.  The last time I had a bunch of people over here, we were reeeeeally loud.  And my dad selfishly was ok with it.  Just said, "Remember how loud Ellen and Mary's get-togethers used to be?"  He's got a point.  I was just thankful that I had enough batteries to crank up my discman the whole time last night.  Phew.

       Do I want it to snow?  Probably do.  We went to the mall yesterday, which was pretty fun.  Philip and Zak embarrassed me a little when they chased after each other with the former's hat, but not enough to really care.  You can't take us anywhere in public.  Then we went to the store that I can't remember the name of with all the massaging chairs and cuddly pillows.  They had to drag me away from that chair.  So nice, so nice.  Haha, we went to two different photobooths, because that's the kind idiots we are.  And to top it off, we shook our polaroid pictures, and sang the song to go with it.  Wait, maybe I was the only one who did that last bit.  Then, I attempted to put Sarah and Hanna's new earrings in, but my fingers were too big. Watched "Ten Things I Hate About You" at Sarah's, which is fun, and interesting to actually  see  it.  Back at home, discovered that I still have the screenplay saved as a word document. Good news:  Today, made an AWESOME cd of all my music that I'm discovering.  I was so excited, I was literally hopping up and down while I waited for it to finish.  It has a lot of stuff, Velvet Underground, Radiohead, Elliott Smith, Dandy Warhols, Hot Hot Heat, all that good stuff.  You know you're excited too. Bad news:  I tried to revive the scanner to put my polaroid on the desktop, but it just decided to suck.  Blah.  Excepting the cd, today was not a good day.  Felt really bad and depressed.  And I fell asleep downstairs again last night. I'm gonna fix up for tomorrow.  If we have to go to school and it's icky and it messes up my hair, I may scream.  Really may.

       The past couple of days have actually been pretty enjoyable.  It snowed on Thursday, as you know, and so I got home at about 11:45.  When the announcement was made fourth period about school closing early, the whole of the east gym burst out with sound.  It was really kind of funny.  Unfortunately, I was too lazy to go to my locker, and so my lunch was left in there to rot over the weekend.  Haha, how pleasant.  Then at home, I watched "Pirates of the Caribbean" for some reason.  It was really the only dvd around, and I was in a Depp mood. I almost had a heart attack when I saw that it was 8:30 when I woke up yesterday morning.  I ambled to the computer, and when I saw that there was no school, I ambled right back into bed without a backwards glance.  Slept four more hours, which shouldn't have been done.  I felt like a gross bum for the rest of the day.  At 6:30, my mom and I picked up Becca from her house, and she took us to the Rialto.  This is always quite amusing; I love how well Becca and my mother get along.  But because nothing can ever go right and my life will always be a sitcom, turned out "Girl with a Pearl Earring" wasn't playing there anymore.  Lovely.  And since my mother had already taken off, we decided just to walk back to my house, since it's really not all that far.  We called Joncie to see if we could swing by, but she had to go out.  So, that was interesting.  I should've worn more than just my hoodie, but oh well.  We got to my mom's house and made some tea, and then basically just talked about life.  Tried to better ourselves.  Never a dull moment with my dearest friend Rebecca.  We came up with two more oneliners for any future attempts at a screenplay.  Any movie I might ever be fortunate enough to be involved with would be only oneliners, I think. Today, I actually got up at a decent hour, and I only slept about eight hours. But my mother trapped me into going to brunch with her, and then I was forced to go to Staples and Borders.  The good thing was that I scored some new pens and pencils out of the deal, but as soon as she found the cd she wanted, we were gone.  I was dragged away from the headphones playing the Belle & Sebastian album.  In Staples, she found and purchased these sticky notes in the shape of huge arrows.  She insisted that they were supposed to be little houses, and that these were perfect for a real estate lawyer like herself.  Sometimes I worry about this woman.  Bloody waste of her money, if you ask me.  Back at home, Hanna and I decided that we would have a gettogether at her house tonight.  But unfortunately, a lot of people were out, and not many could come.  It was still good fun, though.  As much as I enjoy the whole gang, it's sometimes nice to have a smaller party.  Six is a good number.  Though I couldn't tell you what that movie we were watching is about.  I was too busy playing with the little toys that do flips in your hand.  Looked like huge pills.  Actually, my first thought was that they looked like tampons.  Very stubby tampons.  Hahahahahaha, oh me. Now, I'm just sitting here. Ooooh, I wonder how much homework I have.  I need to read "The Odyssey"; we'll see how that goes.  The Oscars are tomorrow, and I am bound and determined to watch every minute.  I actually did this for the first time last year.  And I intend to do the same on Leap Day 2004. Did you notice that I didn't curse in this post??  The closest I came was "bloody."  Over our tea and popcorn, Becca and I agreed that we need to stop cursing so much, because it's getting ridiculous, and it makes you sound kind of stupid.  So, I've decided to give up pervasive cursing for lent.  Hahaha, if you can do that. I'm tired.  I'm going to cuddle up and listen to the "Camp" soundtrack. PS:  Hanna, would you like for me to burn you the aforementioned cd?

       Refreshed, carefree and hungry.   I'm really glad that I finally got my part of the trial project over with. I mean, it was fun and I loved it, but I've been worried all day about it. I actually remembered what I was supposed to say, though. The defense made me look evil and a little stupid, but that's to be expected. Good job, defense! And Kifner wasn't behaving  too  badly. I am a little disappointed that things will be going back to normal actually, because I loved the prosecution class. But, it looks like I'll have to go back the daily grind, and it also looks as though I should actually be reading "The Odyssey." I've mostly been BSing so far, but I need to stop. I have enough time to do it, I'm just too lazy. The laziness has gotten terrible lately, because my piano teacher had to cancel my lesson two weeks in a row. I really need to apply myself better.  When I got home, I realized that I haven't really eaten very much at all lately. So I ate my cheezits from lunch and am sipping the last coke from the fridge. My mood has definitely improved since last night. I was very agitated and preoccupied, and I was taking it out on my mother a little. She was being her normal (if you can call anything about her normal) clingy self. But I really just wanted to be alone, and that wasn't happening. She's like a dog. A dog who makes bad puns, and still hasn't gotten drunk yet. (Hahaha, that was the true part.)  I'm going to watch the new sbemail from yesterday....  Mmm, I might've thought that was funny last summer, but it takes a lot to really amuse me. It is very, very rare that I laugh out loud at something like that when I'm by myself. But if I do, you know it's good. Nowadays, I just watch the old sbemails every so often. I still have some faith in the Brothers Chaps. I mean, the response to that messenger bag was pretty cool. But they'll have to do a little better than that. I bet it's hard to make something funny without the usual gimmicks or gross/profane humor. That's what I admire. I mean, you could show your mom this stuff.  And this stuff goes right over kids' heads.  Although, Dylan's little brother likes to listen to "Strong Bad Sings," which I find absolutely adorable.

       Only here can it snow one week and burn us up the next.  I feel a little better. I'm starting to get over my little slump from Tuesday.  Last night helped a lot.  I mellowed out by walking through Oxford Hills in the twilight.  It was truly beautiful out, with the moon shining softly through the trees.  Then, I listened to some of my newer music, which made me happy. The only downside of this evening is that I have piano.  I haven't had my lesson for a while, because my teacher just moved.  He's not going to happy with me, being that I didn't even look at that new little piece that he's given me.  I may just leave it here and pretend I left it on accident.  Oh, I'm so bad.  I'm interested to hear his comments about the fact that I drew stars all over my left hand and wrist.  He'll probably just laugh at me; sometimes he laughs at any random thing I might say or do.  I don't see the comedy.  Anyway, that'll be tons of fun.  Ha. I need to go practice.  Wish me luck.

       Not a good day.  Felt tired and depressed.  My alarm went off even after my dad woke me up, which really pissed me off for some reason.  So loud and annoying, and totally unnecessary in this case.  Then, I couldn't find my watch, which if possible made me even more angry.  I think my dad was a little frightened of me.  It reminded me of the way that I get really upset or sad, and my dog can tell that something's up.  She starts pacing the floor, and then puts her head in my lap.  My dad was a little like that.  He could tell that I was in a terrible mood. The temperature outside was nice, but it got muggy, and my hair didn't like it.  School wasn't very enjoyable.  I was stuck in Sra. Carr's room forever  because of the stupid 10th grade writing test.  The junior who sits next to me was annoying me.  She can be funny, but I barely know this girl, and after a while, I just wanted her to leave me alone.  She wanted to have a spelling bee, and pouted until someone read words from the dictionary.  At one point, she randomly told me that she loved me, and wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, and that we should get married in San Francisco.  She was probably just being silly.  But I was not in the mood, and decided to just be slightly weirded out.  I wrote a couple poems.  Today is a good poetry day, when I'm in a really bad temper.  It drizzled on me between third and fourth period, which was gross.  The rest of the day just kind of happened.  Not worth talking about.  When I got home, my feet hurt.  I have no idea why they did.  I didn't have to walk anymore than I usually do.  It's just today.  Now, I'm listening to Belle & Sebastian, to the song that describes me at this moment.  Ugh.  I need to get my homework done before 5:30 or so.  Concert tonight.  If I wait to face it until afterwards, I may have a fit. There's nothing to eat.  That sucks.

       LEAP!  Happy Leap Day, all!  Today is only the fourth Leap Day I have seen.  Although I was born in a Leap Year.  I always associate Leap Years with the presidential elections.  Go figure. It was a really nice day outside, but the sky has sadly lost its sheen.  I'll probably still go out.  Lately for some reason, I've been appreciating the days that are especially pretty.  I never used to.  However, I am deeply dreading having to run outside in gym class when it starts to get hot outside.  I have it fourth period, which is both good and bad.  Good because at 10:30, it hasn't gotten that hot yet.  But bad because it's right in the middle of the day, and I have to pull myself together before bio.  Usually I calm down after ten minutes.  That'll be so much fun.  They say their trying to keep us in shape all semester with this A/B day business, but it's really just a way to torture us once a week.  Oh, and I love how affective the crunch tests are.  Yay, let's do 60 without stopping and then wait two months to do it again!  Smart the way they run things. Wow, I just went off on a complete tangent.  I should stop. When ever my mother goes off on tangents, I say to her, "Stop, you're being like a stand-up comedian rambling like that."  But she only takes it as a compliment.

       What can you say about today?  It started off annoyingly as usual.  I didn't sleep very well because I fell asleep on the sofa last night.  At least I didn't really have to pick out anything to wear.  Chorus competition all day long at Meredith.  I think we did ok.  Everyone was like "Oh, my God, we did terribly!"  But it really went about like I thought it would.  Can't expect too much more.  Joncie was pissed off because we didn't get to have anything to eat and she had to stay at Enloe until like 6.  But I was ok with it.  Ashley and I were singing and being silly on the way back to school, which was pretty funny.  My mother actually remembered to pick me up at 3.  We went to Helios, and I got a cookie.  Dina didn't charge us, even she probably should make my mother pay.  Now, I really need to do some work.  Like, real bad.  I totally neglected everything last night. Oh, goodness.  I just remembered that I told Mr. Kifner I would come see him about Marx tomorrow.  Ughh.  I could skip it, but I really shouldn't.  Test Monday, and I need to start at least pretending to care.  I best be off.

       Better be quick before the modem goes down again.  Stupid thing is pissing me off so badly.  It just comes on whenever it feels like it.  I called Time Warner on Friday, and they said they'd send someone over here today between 1 and 5, which means I had to stick around all afternoon.  Then, I get this message on our voice mail saying that they had to cancel the appointment and to call to set up another.  So, I called and yelled at them about it, but the only thing they did was apologize insincerely, and dare to ask, "How's Tuesday between 3 and 5?"  AHHHHHHH!  Yay for having strangers in my house after school with no one else home.  Argh.  Time Warner Cable needs to DIE. This has been the most boring weekend ever.  I couldn't go to see "Havana Nights" yesterday because I couldn't get a ride there, and I wouldn't have been back home in time to babysit.  So I got to stay home and watch old episodes of "The Inferno"; what an awful show that is.  It's amazing what sore losers these people can be.  Who even cares??  My aunt and uncle showed up early to pick me up to go to their house, which I wasn't a fan of.  I think that was the highlight of the weekend:  babysitting my dearest friend.  Ha, not.  Actually, she was fine.  She read me a book, and then we watched "Star Search" for a few minutes until I made her go to bed at 8:30.  Then I got to watch "Frequency" on ABC until 10.  Can you tell that they don't have cable?  My aunt way overpaid me, as always.  I'd feel bad if I wasn't so greedy.  I really needed the money though.  I always turn the neighbors down for babysitting--I cannot stand watching strange children.  Wait, babysitting definitely wasn't the highlight of yesterday; the real highlight was that I finally got some Garnier Fructis.  It smells really good.  I got to use some this morning. Oh, wonderful.  It just went down again.  Now I have to wait God knows how long to publish this.  Sorry if I was talking to you online just now!  Namely, Ashley and Chip.   That is so annoying.  I hate it with such a passion.  So, yeah, it could be hours until this post goes up.  HOURS.  I'm going to fold some laundry like a good little drone. Now I'm watching this crappy MTV movie.  Classic MTV movie formula.  The cameos, the special appearances by an MTV veejay, the sexual innuendos, both same-sex and different, the moderately attractive guy (in this case, the guy from "Camp"; he's a good singer), the dumbish girl who may or may not be a virgin, the smart and eclectic girl, the dork or two, and the whole style in general, a voice-over here, a still shot there.....you know it's gotta be MTV.  That movie "Election" is pretty funny.  Reese Witherspoon did a good job, and Matthew Broderick creeped me out in a way I never thought possible of him. My dad's gonna want to watch "The Simpsons" at 8.  I'll probably end up doing that.

       A blah day.  There really is not much good about today.  I have to do my work.  I really need to get a decent grade on the test tomorrow.  And I have to work on the English project.  I cannot even believe that third quarter is almost over.  That is so weird to me.  Seems like I just got here. Yesterday was not so blah though.  My dad took Mary Alice and me to Moore Square.  The St. Patrick's Day parade was going on, but we mostly just walked around and talked.  I think we missed most of it.  Oh, well.  We went to Subway and Cream "N' Bean, and we met up with Charlie and his family later.  It was pretty cool.  It seems like it's been forever since I got to really talk to Mary Alice.  Then my mom took me to see "The Triplets of Belleville" at the Varsity in Chapel Hill, which I LOVED.  It was not really what I expected.  Then again, I'm not sure what I expected.  There were times when I laughed out loud, and everyone stayed through the credits.  It amazes me, the kind of thought that goes into a production like this that makes the animation seem more real, and yet surreal.  And there's nothing like a good foreign film.  I wish it had won the award for Best Animated Feature Film.  I haven't been to the Varsity since I saw "Monsoon Wedding" last year as "research" for my social studies project on Indian culture.  It's a cool little theater. All I've done today is eat a couple pancakes.  I think I'll go start my homework.

       The weather yesterday was better.   Today it was almost 80 degrees when I woke up, which to me is just kind of gross. It looked like something died outside; all the animals gathered. No joke, there were at least 10 bumblebees and wasps flying around the back patio. I even saw two crows perched on the roof of the carport. I think it's supposed to thunderstorm later. I look forward to that.  I just finished watching "Office Space"; not really my kind of comedy, but there were things about it that I could appreciate. I don't know. There are some things that no matter how clever or funny or well-timed they are, they still just don't quite strike me the right way. It depends on what kind of mood I'm in. The dvd for the movie sucks. It had something at the beginning that was like "Press ENTER to scan for a virus", and when you press ENTER it brings up a screen that detects a virus and then takes you to the menu. There is nothing extra at all. They have a list of the actors in the cast and the trailer and that's it. They can do a little better than that. Maybe I'm being too critical.  I dyed my hair on Thursday afternoon. Very spur-of-moment. Mary and I were at Eckerd's, and I said to her, "I think I'd like to die my hair." And she said, "Well, why don't we get some stuff and do it now?" And so we did. It wasn't too drastic. It just looks a little darker and redder. If anything, it makes me look like what Ellen used to when she would die her hair like this in high school. I knew that it wasn't drastic enough for people to notice for the most part. But good ol' Becca noticed the moment she saw me at lunch. I love that girl. I think I might get something brighter and do it again. We'll see. That makes me the fourth in my immediate family to do something with red. My mom did it first, then Ellen, then Mary, and now me. I don't think my dad will ever do it.

       Wow.  I just got home from seeing "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" at the Rialto with my sister.  Really quite, quite good.  I need to see it again though, soak everything up another time, maybe catch a few more details.  It was one of those movies where you watch the trailer and walk in there thinking you know what's up.  Then by the time the movie is about half over, you realize that it's completely different from what you thought.  And when the credits start to roll, you just sit there and bask in your confusion and awe.  Or at least that's how it was for me.  Definitely similar type of material as in "Being John Malkovich".  Anyway, I'm not going to try to describe it much more than that.  You'll just have to see it for yourself.  (I think I like Dunst better when she's supposed to be stoned.) Well, that was definitely the highlight of today.  No doubt there. I should go study for Part II of the Greek test.  Ha, we'll see how that goes.  I still gotta figure out what I'm going to do tomorrow.  Hanna said I could ride her bus tomorrow and go straight to the show and then home, but I have a feeling I'm not going to have the time for that, especially not right in the middle of the week.  I may just have to force my mother to take me there and back.  Hmmmm.

       Steal some covers, share some skin.  Wow, it's been a weird week.  What has happened?  I feel like I don't have any control over anything lately.  All I really have anymore is music.  It seems like it is deeply involved in every aspect of my life.  I'm just permenantly dazed nowadays.  Hmmm, maybe it's just Sunday morning and I'm in a weird mood.  The Death Cab for Cutie album that I put on must just be helping me embrace my weird mood, and the Sundayness of it all.  This morning when I logged onto AIM, there were only about 10 people online, and it really made me sad for some reason. I guess I had a good weekend, social and anti-social in its own ways.  On Friday, I went home with Mary Alice after school and her mom took us to School Kids and to get Chinese food.  Then we went straight to Philip's surprise party.  That was one of the longest days of my life.  Yesterday during the day I did absolutely nothing.  I watched crap on tv, and then I went outside for a couple of hours.  The most productive thing I did was clean myself up and pick out an outfit for the party, which for me takes forever.  Charlie put on a good party.  I didn't know some of the people there, but that didn't stop me from hanging around the exact same people I always hang around with.  I thought it was fun.  And I was proud that I got a good present and made a good card.  I don't always care enough to do that, especially if I think I can get away with getting a not good present. Mary is coming home today for her Spring Break!  I'm excited; I have missed that kid.  When is our Spring Break? I wish it was yesterday again.  Then I'd be able to do nothing all day and then get to see everyone at night.  At least I don't have that much work to do.  We're kind of between projects in C and C right now.  I want the trial project to come back right now.  I loved that.  We need to at least keep the prosecution class. I should go get dressed.  I think my dad wants to take me out for breakfast.  I need to be a little more patient with my parents; they think I hate them, and I really don't.  I just need space right now.  I hope my Sunday morning mood doesn't jump out and bite my dad.

       Spring cleaning like it's my JOB.  Today when I went into my room after I took a shower, I suddenly felt so depressed.  Not only was the room messy and cluttered and could've done with a good sweeping, but it just was not me.  Over the last three and a half years, I kept adding to it but I never took away.  It was awful.  It brought back memories of times when I was even more insecure than I am now.  So I decided to change all of that, and give my room the best cleaning it has ever had.  You would not believe how much crap I threw away.  I was in a ruthless mood; nothing that should've been thrown away was saved this time.  I filled up at least three garbage bags.  And there was also stuff that I'm going to put in the attic, so that it will no longer be clutter!  I swept the floor and beat the African rug.  I took down my old posters, and my bookshelves.  ("Where are the going to put all this, may I ask?" asks my father.")  The only books I need are lined up on my desk now--the rest will go into hiding or be given away.  I lined all my shoes up in the closet.  Even the huge white ape that Hanna gave me for my thirteenth birthday has been rearranged.   Oh oh!  And I found my watch!  That sucker has been missing forever.  I would not have found it under my bed otherwise.  The room actually looks a lot bigger.  And the best part is that now that it's not cluttered, I'm going to focus on moving more stuff in.  I've been meaning to get the Union Jack up there.  Maybe some song lyrics.  I'm so excited.  And tomorrow I've already decided that I'm doing my bathroom.  Wow, I am such a loser.  Getting all excited like this because I cleaned my room up.  But this was not just any cleaning--this was scraping the scum of eighth grade Annie from every inch of the space.  I have the worst habits as it is.  My parents are not exactly clean freaks.  They don't make me clean up my rooms.  Anyway, it made me happy.  It just looks nice; I think it's forgiven me for letting it go rather sour.  It was like getting a really bad taste out of my mouth. I do not understand my father.  Could there be some kind of midlife crisis going on I wonder?  I caught him watching "Made" on MTV today.  What the hell?!  He likes to watch whatever I'm watching I guess.  We watched "The O.C." together the other night, which was kind of funny really.  And he watched "Jerry Maguire" on TNT with me tonight.  That is a good movie.  There is something comforting about a nice 90s dramedy, especially with a supporting role by Bonnie Hunt.  You gotta have Bonnie to be the sister or the best friend, or even the mother. All I know is that I must never never never ever let my room get like that again.  Yay for my new spring break project!

       Mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time.  Yeah, I've been singing "Roses" for the past like hour and a half.  I don't even know why.  Outkast fever I suppose.  Hell, even my mom was singing "Hey ya" in the car today. Hahaha, I had a funny dream last night.  I was watching The Real World at like 10 before I went to bed for some reason.  And when I went to bed I dreamed that I was part of The Real World.  I don't remember all that much, but the commentaries were funny.  I think there were some other people from Enloe there too.  And there was drama.  Actually, I was surprised at the shortage of drama in the current season of Real World, at least from what I could tell from like two episodes last night.  Anyway, watching it took me back to about the fifth grade.  It might have been even further back than that.  Back when the twins used to watch some MTV, and it must have been before they deemed it uncool officially.  It really has not changed much. I need to get my act together tonight.  At least read some Jane Eyre.  I'll try to care. I have had a good last couple of days.  It's just been a second semester so far in general for me.  There's definitely been a few times that were not fun.  But I think I may actually be sorry to see freshman year go. I'm so excited about spring break though!  I think it will be fun.  Even if we can't really drink--HAHA.  Wow, there was definitely some talk among the parents about that.  Hanna, I'm sorry if there was any kind of drama from that.  As usual, my parents had absolutely no idea; they were as out of it as ever.  Would we have really done it anyway?

       We're leaving tomorrow!  I am excited.  I've packed way too much, but oh well.  That I cannot help.  The only thing is that I really doubt I'm going to have the time to finish Jane Eyre by a week from today.  I don't know--it could happen.  I just hope there's not a huge quiz on the very day that we get back.  That is a lot of material.  Maybe we'll just have a test.  Or a project, would be much better.  The major projects I actually enjoy.  They help my Kifner grade. I will be glad to get out of town, and get some fresh air.  And I won't have my mother hounding me to wear more sunscreen. AHHHH, I have to face my dose of physical abuse for the week.  Well, it's not THAT bad.  It just hurts my back, and my hands from stretching my fingers too far.  Last week my dad was late to pick me up, and I had to sit there while my teacher talked my freaking ear off.  Oh, my dear LORD.  He's my mom's friend though.  And she won't be late.  The only good thing is that he will never, ever hit on me.  Ever.  He is as gay as they come. Alright, I gotta jet off to my lovely pianoforte.

       I am happy.  I have had a very good day.  Weird, but good.  Anything different is good, in my opinion.  So you're going to hear all about it, whether you want to or not, dammit. I woke up to a hot shower this morning, which I haven't done in a long time.  It was nice.  I actually felt awake.  And I got up early to do it, so there was plenty of time left to have a good breakfast.  I let my hair do its own thing.  It smiled and thanked me for not burning it.  The morning passed fairly uneventfully.  It sounds strange, but I feel like I'm on my own, in the best sense.  Every class is different.  I feel more individual.  It is great, because I never tire of the gang.  And I look forward to seeing them at lunch.  We were discussing this at dinner.  It is funny how I've stayed so close to the people with whom I have no classes.  All you need is good conversation and lots of bonding time, even if it's outside school.  By sixth period today, I was in love with everyone and everything.  Then in Mrs. Krizmanich's class, we had a quiz on Jane Eyre.  I freaking loved that book, and I actually read it on time and knew it all.  I think I got every question right.  I was actually enjoying answering the questions; I probably elaborated more than I needed to.  I was in such a good mood that Mr. Kifner was not annoying me at all.  I realized that he is liberal, and I agree with his opinions in some ways.  Maybe it was my mood talking, but I thought to myself, I'm really going to try harder in this class.  There's no reason at all to slack off at this point.  So I dug in.  I even told him to have a good weekend as I left.  I don't think I've ever done that, or even considered doing it.  So C and C was inspiring.  After reading pretty much all of Jane Eyre in three days, I feel absolutely no inclination to halfass my way through the rest of this year.  None. The bus was annoying.  I cannot stand some of those people.  I stick out like a sore thumb; everyone seems to have adopted the same clothing, conversation and personality.  I must not have gotten the memo.  But the walk was nice, as it was GORGEOUS outside today.  When I got home, I actually got all my rides to Enloe and the Mellow Mushroom and back home arranged.  I am still surprised at how it worked out.  Acting Night was fun.  You all did a fabulous job!  We had a good time at the Mellow Mushroom; it's nice to stay out late.  Unfortunately we couldn't go down to Helios afterwards.  But it was ok.  I was still in love with everyone.  When I got home, my mother noticed a change in me.  "You just look different.  Like you're more comfortable and composed, or something.  You're not the same as you were yesterday."  I'm not sure what that means.  I sat in my room and just stared at the clock on my wall and thought.  I thought about school and music and film and my family and friends.  I thought about how life was a year ago, and I realized what complete and utter hell that was.  If I had not moved away from it all, I really might've gone insane.  I needed to document this.  I know this all probably sounds really cheesy, and that I may just be in that dumb whatdoesitallmean phase, the perfect cliché of an American teenager.  But I can't help it. It is Saturday now.  I've been writing this on and off for probably close to an hour.  Wow, this is a really personal post.  Now the whole world knows, and I am so totally ok with that.  I hope this quiet euphoria lasts a little longer.  But I fear that it will exhaust with time and some sleep; tomorrow will not be the same. Maybe it's just that I had the first really good day of my life.  Who knows.  God, what wonders a hot shower first thing in the morning can do.

       Oof.  What a Tuesday.  It started out like any other day.  My mother criticized my choice of clothes.  And when she asked me if they let me wear that stuff to school, I told her "Only if I sleep with the administrators first."  I don't think she thought it was funny.  And I really just don't care. It was good to be back at school.  I missed having a set schedule, and a male presence in general.  My dad does not count.  My hair is even redder now, and people actually noticed this time around.  I think it was starting to fade.  And I had given it a break from the straightener for a while, but that was changed today.  I think it deserved spring break more than I did. It was rainy today, and I had to take to the bus home.  But it was alright--Alex and Mary Alice helped me not to miss it.  I don't even have much homework.  It's a little eerie.  I just have to read Jane Eyre.  I'm supposed to have it done by Friday, and that may actually happen.  We'll see.  If I don't fall asleep too much.  I fell asleep watching "I love the 80s" this afternoon.  They were talking about "Top Gun" when I woke up.  I've never actually seen that.  I probably should if I want to be up on the movie classics, which I do.  I bet I could tolerate Tom Cruise for a little while.  Now I have the song stuck in my head.  What other good songs by Berlin are there?  That's the only one I know.  There's gotta be something. I'm going to go play the piano.  Give the dogs a treat.  Rufus usually comes and lies down under the piano to listen to the music.  It's really cute.

       Annie = 80s fan.  I really don't know what it is lately, but it's everywhere.  I'll see something and just think, Wow, that is so 80s.  Hmmm.  Well, I guess I don't need a reason to be a fan of something.  I've lasted this long without reason.  I needn't make sense now. Well, piano was actually pretty good.  I had him help me rehearse my song for Saturday.  He's a really good singer--sometimes I forget about his theatre background.  So I didn't have to play the sonata today (and good thing too). I going to go clean myself up.  I feel soiled from the day.

       Oh, to be  in  school and on my own.  Ok, so I still live here, but I do not feel connected to my mother.  Ah, such is life. Just did the reading from "Civics Today."  And by "did", I meaned copied down the blue words mainly.  I hate that damned book so much.  Ha, wonder if I should go back and read what I wrote, being that I don't remember much at all of what I just studied.  Yes, I will.  I really am determined not to do badly.  Nobody else is going to help me, so I might as well buckle down. Day of silence tomorrow.  Hope I don't crack.  Do I have to start from the moment I wake up, or can I wait till school?  Lunch is going to be weird.  All we do talk and laugh.  We'll probably just stare at each other the whole time.  I will start laughing, I just know it.  Unfortunately I think I will probably do my chorus audition tomorrow.  I am not going to jeopardize that by not singing, the GSA will just have to pardon me for five minutes.  Otherwise, I bet I could go through all my other classes.  We'll see how that goes down.  Alex and I are planning to play charades during Kifner tomorrow if we get a chance to work on the project and I have to communicate.  Ha, he will love that, I just know. Ewww, 4/20 was sweaty.  Krizmanich's room was hot as balls.  Hahaha, that's a funny expression.  And I had to take home a lot of stuff, so my shoulder really almost fell off on the walk home.  But it amused me today that people would blame their sleepyness or fatigue on 4/20.  I was reminded of the chorus trip two years ago when those girls got fliers about it with a drawing of a caterpillar smoking pot on them from some mysterious little shop. I'm listening to this song by The Stills from the February/March Monitor This that I stole from my dad.  There are soooo many songs about heartbreak, as Rob Gordon (NOT from Enloe) was good enough to point out in High Fidelity.  "What came first--the music or the misery?"  Sometimes I wonder.

       Hmmm, not sure why I'm writing this.  I should be in bed.  Actually, no--I should be studying for Kifner's test tomorrow.  Normally, I get totally stressed out before one of his tests, but tonight I am not worried about it at all.  And this is what worries me.  Where is this confidence coming from?  It is a sad day indeed when one must worry about worrying.  This test is no simpler or better than the others.  In fact, it is probably worse.  But I cannot bring myself to worry enough to study well.  It looks like I'll have to force myself.  I already went over most of the stuff, but I need to do it all again.  God, it's 11 o'clock.  What am I doing sitting here?  Wow, this is the point where I've totally lost control over my actions.  Maybe there's more to this procrastination than I thought.  Hahaha, it's kind of funny really.  Or maybe it's not, and I'm just crazy. Ok, I really am going now.  Force-feed this crap into my mind.  The test is only about 14.5 hours away.

       Yeah, it's kinda like that.  So, I get home from school at 3, right?  Haven't been in two seconds when my mother calls.  "I'm coming to get you right now for the dentist.  Your appointment is at 3:15."  Since when did I have a dentist appointment today?  I walk in, and Johnette the receptionist gives me her simpering smile, pressing the buzzer to signal the drones they call hygienists.  But, surprise of surprises, mine wasn't a drone today.  This woman made  interesting  conversation. She and her husband moved down from Vermont 6 months ago apparently.  She talked about college, and where I want to go, and where Ellen and Mary go.  She went to the University of Vermont I think she said.  She talked about how conservative everyone around here is, and how she misses it in Vermont because everyone curses more up there.  She accidentally snagged my lip with the pointy thing, and after apologizing, asked if I wanted my lip pierced.  I said no, but I had thoughts of an eyebrow ring.  "Oh, I bet your mom would love that.  When I got my tattoo, there was a guy who was getting his eyebrow pierced.  He fainted."  Then she talked about the tattoo on her back.  "Yeah, I'm afraid if I wear something strapless everyone can see it.  Like, everyone saw it at my wedding.  But after a few drinks, I didn't care much."  Wow, did she just say that? The regular dentist wasn't there today, so some other guy (he was a dentist too, I just don't remember his name) examined me at the end.  He and the hygienist were talking about vegetables as he worked on my mouth. "Yeah, I like my tomatoes with salt.  My sister used to put sugar on hers." "Ewwww, I would hate that.  I like cucumbers with salt though." It was the randomest thing ever.  Really quite amusing.  They were almost flirting with each other -- and over vegetables.  I promise that I am not making this up. At the end, my mom came and paid for everything.  Johnette worked her magic with the computer and informed me that my next appointment is on the afternoon of Wednesday October 27th.  That was by far the most interesting dentist appointment I've ever had.  I think they will get much better somehow. By that time, I was really hungry.  So after half an hour, I forced some pretzels and a bottle of water down.  And that pretty much brings us up to now.  I think I'll go take a shower.  I feel icky.

       'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down, and the whole world loves it when you make that sound.  Actually, that title doesn't reflect my mood at all.  I have nothing to complain about.  Hell, I had Subway for dinnner.  I just love that song is all.  Outkast is just the greatest.  I watched the video for Roses all the way through for the first time today, and I thought, wow, this is all I really need in life.  Anyway, I don't know that there is a song that reflects my mood right now.  It would probably be kind of boring. Today is my mother's birthday.  Just glad I remembered.  Oooh, she's about to go to Eckerd's.  I need some more dye, yo.  I'll be back. Ok, here I am.  Could it be that I don't have any homework?  Sure looks that way.  That's pretty hot.  God, this week went by so fast.  I'm excited about the weekend.  I need to get some sleep.  I've been going to bed later than usual.  Should probably stop that. I got an invitation to my cousin's wedding shower yesterday.  That'll be really fun.  And the wedding in July will be an interesting experience.  I haven't been to a wedding in a really long time.  You know what this means: my parents must buy me a new outfit.  Mwhahahaha!  I love it when they have to give me stuff.

        I am yours, you are mine, you are what you are.   I am writing my gothic tale for Krizmanich.  Haha, that's been an interesting process.  I had trouble getting into it up until last night when I wrote eight pages.  I don't think it's gothic enough.  Honestly, to me it seems more like a cross between my life and a teen movie.  The idea came to me in a dream I had on Friday night, although I changed it a LOT.  I took the girl's name from the dream and the basic plot.  I have had fun with the whole thing.  I'm still trying to tie the climax of the love story and the supernatural event in.  I'm planning that this girl will lose her virginity and then get into a huge fight with her mother about it.  That'll be fun to write.  Mother/daughter relationships are interesting to me.  Like in "Real Women Have Curves."  That is a really good movie, and the relationship between the girl and her mother does not seem fake at all to me.  I'm struggling with that bit.  In the case of my short story, although the character shares many of my experiences, she has different relationships with friends and family than I have, so I cannot write that part from experience so much.  One thing is for sure--I will not have it finished totally by tomorrow.  My peers will just have to deal with editing only part of the story.  I hope I can fit this thing into less than 15 pages.  I wish I had recorded that dream after I had it. I think I will watch a movie tonight.  I probably shouldn't, but I really feel like it right now.  My mother is going to my cousin's dance recital.  I told her I had too much homework to do, which is kind of true.  I think I'm going to get that movie started now so that it won't finish too late.

       Mmmmm, Annie is comfortably full.  We went to 518 tonight.  I had a salad and some bread, which was good enough.  Then I got vanilla and chocolate gelato.  Soooooo delicious.  It was perfect.  I felt the exact amount of fullness desired.  And it came with a spearmint leaf, which I ate afterwards for fresh breath.  It was a little weird, eating a leaf, but it worked. Yay, I'm having an interesting conversation with Sarah.  Take a look: AndNowSarahSays: i wonder how much guys think of sex siriuslymad15: see, they can make a "what women want" siriuslymad15: but a "what men want"... siriuslymad15: would be nothing short of pornography AndNowSarahSays: HAHAHAHAHAHAH (Haha, yes, as you can see, the usual topic of discussion is still...well, the usual topic of discussion.) AndNowSarahSays: guys. I hate them all sometimes. siriuslymad15: yeah, yeah siriuslymad15: as do i siriuslymad15: sometimes i just want to slap any random one i see AndNowSarahSays: that should be a holiday AndNowSarahSays: 'slap random boy day' siriuslymad15: HAHA siriuslymad15: i love it! siriuslymad15: we should actually have it AndNowSarahSays: we sooooo should AndNowSarahSays: kind of like lesbian day, hahha. siriuslymad15: oh, yeah We actually had a Lesbian Day that we created for some reason.  Like we need a reason or a day to be lesbians.  We couldn't remember the exact day, but it was something like March 17.

       It has been a little while.  I feel so torn about school ending.  I truly cannot decide whether I am happy or sad about this.  I thought about it a lot today, and I almost started to cry.  But at the same time, I was thinking, "What the hell is wrong with me?  It's almost summer."  I don't think it's ever been like this for me before.  This time last year I was ready to kill myself to get out of school.  Oh, well.  Summer will come whether I feel torn or not. I had the health exam today.  What a fucking joke.  Didn't even think of looking over anything beforehand.  Doubt it would've made any kind of difference. I got into Advanced Women's!  I am very happy and excited about this.  Some of the people in there are my favorites, and I get to go to Hawaii if that works out.  So that should be a bunch of fun.  It is about damned time she posted that stupid thing.  Jesus Christ.  It should've been done three and a half weeks ago.  It was getting to the point where it became a game of seeing how annoying and unnecessary things can get.  At least it is done now. I watched Kill Bill Volume 1 this evening.  LOVED IT.  Seriously, the style, the dialogue, the music, the camera work, pretty much every aspect of how it was made--it is all BRILLIANT.  What a wonderful opening scene.  My favorite was the use of color versus black and white and how it kept switching.  The violence didn't even really bother me.  I definitely got used to it by the time she was slaughtering the Crazy 88.  Although I thought those Anime scenes were a little much.  Ughhh, the pedofile.  There were definitely times when I shouted "Oh, my GOD!" at the television.  But I laughed hysterically at some of those fountains of blood.  And woot for the 5.6.7.8.'s.  I might have to buy that soundtrack.  Now Hanna and I must see Volume 2.  I have seen a lot of good movies in the last couple of months.  It makes me wonder why I ever bother seeing the bad ones. Yay, talking about this puts me back into a good mood.  I forgot that I like to write blog entries.

       A freshman no longer.  Did school seriously end?  I feel no difference.  It will hit me eventually, perhaps sometime next week.  Who knows?  I thought I should write an entry for today. My mom was more excited about the end of school than I was.  She doesn't have to drive me down there again until August.  Wow, guys.  August.  We have no homework until August.  Why is this so weird to me?  This has happened, what, nine other times?  Oh, well.  I will get lazy and used to it.  I need to find stuff to do.  Let's see.  Focus on piano.  This means an hour a day, four or five times a week.  Do you know how much better I would get if I did that?  I'm gonna go for it.  That would rock.  Also, I am going to start running more often.  Listen to lots of music.  Oh, and you know I will make friends with the Blockbuster folk again this summer.  For a while, my mom and I referred to the employees using their first names.  We should just get Netflix already.  And what else?  Write stuff, read stuff.  And keep in touch with people!  I must spend time with all of you.  Don't stray too far. Hey, it's Thursday now.  Shit, I need to make sure my dad remembers to go to the Hawaii meeting tomorrow.  I am excited about the party!  Ok, I'm tired.

       Another day, another entry.  Yes, I am back. So Tuesday I went to Anna's house. Hahaha, what a fun girl. We watched Win a Date with Tad Hamilton. Cute movie, really. I was rooting for her friend the whole time. No one as hot as Tad Hamilton can ever be that nice. And then we walked to the houses overlooking the lake in her neighborhood. I had no idea that was there. It's a nice place. I'd go there all the time if I lived that close. Then when I got home I messed around, and I watched The Truth About Cats and Dogs. That is also cute. When my mom and sister got home, they announced that we were going to see Bon Voyage at the Colony. So that makes three movies. I liked Bon Voyage a lot though. Very entertaining. It makes me wish I was French. Shit, I guess that'll never happen. And THEN on the way home, I realized that we had rented In America and it was due the next day. And I really wanted to see that movie. So that made four movies in one day. And two times that I wished I wasn't American. Very good movie. I encourage you all to see it. Yesterday I went to the pool with Mary Alice. That was fun. I have even more freckles. Once again, this was within walking distance. I wish I had a pool within walking distance. I got to eat spaghetti with her family. Oh, and I installed AIM for her. Yay for communication. I didn't watch any movies that day. Probably time for a break from that. I'm such a freak. In an hour or so, I'm going to walk up to Joncie's house to see her and the crew before she leaves for Spain tomorrow. I should go practice. I've got the lesson today.

       Summer is overrated.  Well, it came. Why do I find myself wishing I was back in school? This is really boring. I have listened to so many of the same mp3s over and over again. So many lyrics. Jesus. I need something to do. Maybe I'll call Anna. Apparently, we will be hanging out "all over June." Hahahahaha. I wonder if May 31 is too early. Right now, I think I'll talk to this thing for a while. There are only about twenty or so people online, and most of them I don't really talk to anyway. What have I done since the last entry?  Thursday  - Got up, went to the mall with Sarah. Hahaha, twelve hours after our bonding. So, yeah, that was hot. We got birthday presents for my Jewish girls. I found it entertaining that we managed to knock over the display of thongs. And that we took my present and wrapped it sitting in Starbucks. Those boxes from Delia's look like spaceships. Then we came back here and made cards until Sarah's mom picked her up. After that, I cleaned myself up and went to Becca's party. So I got to see my tree stump kids among others. And there was more than one scandal to be had. But overall it was great. When I got home, I stayed online until 3:30 in the morning talking about life with Chip. My mom thought I was fucking crazy. She was right.  Friday  - Completely lost track of time. I was going to go to Shelley Lake but it was really too late by the time I woke up and I couldn't really find a ride. I watched Pleasantville. There really isn't much about that movie that I don't love. Yeah, not much else to say about that. Then, I went to Mary Alice's house. We had some good conversation and pizza down the street. When we got back to her room, she switched the light on and it burned out. So she turned on her lava lamp and her flamingo light, and that really just made the pillow talk even better.  Saturday  - Well, I went to Hanna's house and watched MTV. Then her father took us to see Kill Bill Volume 2. Oh, my. It was FABULOUS. Seriously, what a wonderful production. Stuff like this is the reason I have survived this far in life. It was funny because there's a lot of dialogue in the movie, and often there's no music so it is pretty quiet. We could hear the music from the trailers in neighboring theaters. Hanna turned to me and said "I hear Harry Potter!" The violence is not so pervasive but it is more realistic. Whatever, I still loved it. After that, I went back to Hanna's house and enjoyed a low-carb dinner. The Newmans and I went on a walk around the neighborhood. I love them all. It was perfect outside and that made me happy. Hanna and I talked about Kill Bill and how we pity people who won't see it just because they cannot see past the violence. Hahaha, we are so smug. It's true though. It's amazing what you can miss out on just because you are too apprehensive. Then somehow we got to talking about religion. She brought up some really good points, and it made me think. We came back to what Serendipity says in the movie Dogma, that it doesn't matter what you have faith in as long as you have faith. Sigh. Once we reached the house again, her father took us down to Helios and then I went home. Mary had arrived earlier that day while I was at the movies. She drove down from Maine in the Memorial Day Weekend traffic. I've missed that kid. Oh, and then I talked to Becca on the phone. That was a good day.  Sunday  - I went with my mother and sister to JC Penney for a new mattress. Mary and I ended up sitting on one of the couches waiting for my mother to finish paying and whatnot. She set my watch to the right time, a feat that no one has yet managed. I might have to write it down to remember for next Daylight Savings. She convinced me to go see Troy again with her. So I did. And it was...the same as the first time. It's not really the kind of movie where you can catch more details in a second viewing.  And now it is Monday.  And all I have done is write a long entry. I am such a hypocrit. Just the other day, I was saying to Becca that it is boring to read five pages of random crap in people's blogs. And now I have typed five pages of random crap for people to read. I feel kind of bad. But, I am bored! Oh, well. I'm sure I will be back soon.

       Thought a lot, ignored the right to be.  And the summer continues.  The past few days have not been the most eventful of the life.  I would type every detail of each day since my last entry like I did that one time, but it's been too long and I don't think I could remember enough.  It feels like much longer than a week since last I wrote.  But I will say this:  I've managed to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on two different occasions.  Once with assorted friends, and once with my mother, sister, uncle, my first cousin once removed and his wife.  Yeah, it's a lot better this time around.  Like, totally different feel.  This guy (Alfonso Cuaron) obviously isn't a hard-core fan, which means he's not afraid to leave out details and change the order of events to benefit the outcome of the movie.  Pretty risky really.  I mean, Jesus, no one wants to be hunted down by the Harry Potter nazis.  I thought he did a good job.  The only other movie I know of that he directed is Y Tú Mamá También, which is hardly similar to Harry Potter.  But yeah, this was just a better production, although perhaps it helps that this is also the best book of the first three.  Even the acting was better.  I was satisfied with it.  I also saw Super-Size Me at the Rialto.  Ugh, so much disgusting food.  It's pretty incredible how much weight this guy gained in a very short period of time.  The doctors were astounded.  Good documentary too. I'm kind of tired.  I really need to go to bed early tonight.  TAP starts tomorrow at 9.  I have been on the weirdest sleeping schedule lately, as in going to bed anytime between 3 and 5 in the morning and waking up at about 1 or 2.  It's crazy.  I actually managed to get up at 10:30 this morning.  So maybe I'll find sleep before 3 tonight.  I may take some Tylenol PM. Well, that's enough for now, I think.

       Although my lover lives in a place that I can't live, I find I like a life this lonely.  I'd say it's been a good week.  I'm having a really good time at TAP because I finally got a fun part and I like the people a lot.  Today was pretty long though.  I have to be off-book by Monday.  I'm hoping that will turn out ok.  Caroline and Allison came to visit us on Wednesday, which was great because I love and miss them so much.  We were trying on costumes.  I found it quite entertaining that when Caroline zipped up the side of my dress, the zipper pinched my skin, leaving two little red marks on my side.  It looked like a vampire bit me, or maybe a viper struck me.  It didn't even hurt that much, it was really just funny.  Then yesterday, Philip Boyne got home from Rome and started TAP so now he drives me, which is good.  I'm pretty glad that I don't have to force my parents or sister to drive to Cary Academy every day anymore.  But, yeah.  I feel like I haven't seen anyone from Enloe in forever!  Tonight I went to see in Dylan in the STAS Intensive production of the Laramie Project.  I've always heard about that play, but I'd never seen it.  Very interesting and insightful.  And the acting was marvelous, of course.  I'm really glad I went to see Dylan. Now I am eating Chinese food and listening to Franz Ferdinand.  I am really getting into them.  I want to buy the cd.  I saw them on Conan O'Brien the other day, hahaha.  But I feel kind of gross, so I am going to go take a shower.

       Good mood!  Mine certainly is right now.  I'm not sure exactly why.  I really feel like dancing around.  I might actually go do that in a few minutes.  It's been a good couple of days.  I'm having a lot of fun at TAP this year.  I was so tired of being bored.  It is a really funny and fun show, and this year I got the biggest part I've had so far.  I'm still not quite sure whether I want to invite a bunch of people from school to the show.  I kind of like to separate this kind of experience from that.  But, who knows?  Maybe my mind will change.  Maybe some of the people from past years will come to the show and I'll get to see them.  That would be fun.  I know Caroline and Allison are.  We'll see who else comes. Well, I don't have anything else to say.  I think I'll go find something better to do.  I've gotta get to bed early tonight.

       Sigh.  I am so content right now.  I wish life could be like this all the time.  The show opened last night; it was just really fun.  I had such a good time this year.  TAP is a happy place.  I think it is the place where I am most respected, and that means so much to me.  It's nice to know that I can come back to that and that I'm still eligible for four more years.  Although I won't deny that I have been pretty worn out.  The Enloe chorus carwash got rained out so I finally got to sleep late this morning.  When I woke up and looked in the mirror, I almost laughed out loud at how much stage makeup was still on my face.  Today will definitely be a chilled out day.  I have to be back at Cary Academy by 6:30.  The cast party is tonight.  That ought to be really fun because I'm pretty sure that Caro is staying after the show.  The thing I'm not looking forward to is the withdrawal come Monday.  Oh well.  Nothing to do but savor until then. Hmmm, I think Joncie called here.  I need to go call her back.  Then I will plop down with my discman and the Decemberists.  It will be a mellow five hours.

       So if you have a minute why don't we go  Talk about it somewhere only we know?  Rain is beautfiul.  I went outside and just stood in it until I got cold.  This is how I spend the days of summer. So what did I do this week?  Well, TAP ended this weekend.  I immediately became extremely bored and lonely, needless to say.  When I got home on Sunday night after strike, I was really almost desperate to find something to distract me.  I talked to Chip on the phone for a while, which helped.  But I definitely spent a good bit of this week moping.  I shouldn't do that; pouting is dumb and unnecessary.  I should've seen this coming.  Well, I'm getting over it.  I mean, I've got to; there's no other solution.  I was talking to Ellen about it and she said something that comforted me a lot.  "It's great that you had fun.  And at least you know that you enjoyed yourself enough to be sorry once ended."  I think I'll stop talking about this now.  Probably shouldn't have mentioned it. Saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  Oh, man.  If you are on the fence about your opinion of the Bush administration, please see this movie.  If you care enough to read my blog and listen to me ramble like this, take the time to listen to Moore.  That's all I have to say about that. And I saw Spider-Man 2.  Twice in three days.  I'd say I liked it.  I admire a movie that isn't afraid to make fun of itself.  I like the comic book feel.  And if nothing else, it does have Tobey Maguire.  I kind of wish I had waited a little longer before seeing it again, but I could not pass up the opportunity to leave the house.  I am really interested to see which movies are at the top of the box office by tomorrow.  Maybe Fahrenheit 9/11 is still close to the top. I got three pairs of shoes and a shirt from urbanoutfitters.com.  I was really surprised at how fast they were shipped here.  I ordered them Tuesday and they arrived yesterday.  Usually it takes like five or six days.  Sometimes I wish there was an Urban Outfitters around here.  I really need to get a new dress for the wedding next weekend.  We went to Uniquities on Monday, but I really saw nothing that I would want to wear.  I'll probably just go to Express.  Too bad the one at Crabtree is closed. Now I think I'll go listen to Death Cab and find something to read for a while.

      I think I'm going to start using real titles now.  I think it looks better that way. Well, the last few days were actually pretty enjoyable.  On Thursday Mary and I made the drive to Arlington.  Unfortunately once we reached the city itself, the Mapquest directions sucked horribly.  I have no idea how we reached the right neighborhood.  I had to call the hotel and ask the guy at the desk to walk us through it.  Then as we pulled up to the curb, Ellen jumped out of nowhere.  I hadn't seen her since January or February.  She had arrived earlier that day from Argentina.  And so Team Medlin was reunited.  I spent the next couple of days basically just screwing around with the two of them and some of my mom's family.  I got to go shopping in Georgetown on Saturday across the bridge, which was fun.  I found the skirt that was out of stock on urbanoutfitters.com in the actual store when I was there.  And a shirt with a dinosaur. The wedding was beautiful.  It was outside in the garden of this little Unitarian church.  I have never seen Cynthia so happy.  I think this was the first wedding I've been to where I was old enough to appreciate the significance and where I really cared about the person.  It made me want the kind of settlement that comes with marriage, especially in this case.  I wonder what that feels like. And then there was the reception.  Oooooh, man.  I have never seen my mother's family dance in my life.  It was really pretty hilarious.  Like three generations of people were out there busting out every move they knew.  It was like they had been waiting years to get a chance to do it.  There was a man video-taping the whole thing.  I hope I never EVER see that tape with me dancing around on it.  But the best part was that I caught the bouquet when it was thrown!!  It was so exciting, although I know for a fact that I will not be next to get married in our family.  Hahaha.  So that was really fun. Today has not been eventful.  My piano lesson got cancelled.  It was nice not to have to go out there, but at the same I was kind of disappointed.  I might not've been quite so bored.  Oh well.  Oh, my God, that storm this evening was wonderful.  I got really excited when the computer flickered on and off a couple times and I realized it was brewing outside.  So I stood in the front yard and watched the leaves blow and the trees sway and the sky darken.  It was beautiful.  I retreated to the screen porch after it had rained for a minute or so because I was really cold.  I was quickly joined by every other member of the house including the dogs.  Storms like that really make me happy for some reason. Hmm, I'm a little weirded right now because I just watched Donnie Darko.  Really good movie though.  But there was a lot of stuff going on in the house at the time and I got a little distracted so I think I missed a few things.  I might have to watch it again.  There will be time for that, no doubt.  I've watched a bunch of rented movies lately.  I think the best one was Lost in Translation, or maybe Mystic River.  Monster was good too.  Those are all Academy movies.  But, hey, at least Lost in Translation's indie.  I watched that one twice, and I liked it even more the second time, which is pretty rare.  Sophia Coppola is my friend. Alright, I think I'm gonna head to bed.  I might post a picture from the wedding in a few minutes though.

      Just a correction.&nbsp; There should be a break between the makeup question and the in my&nbsp;mouth question in that survey.&nbsp; Normally I'd be anal enough to post the whole thing again, but I'd have to make everything bold again, and I refuse to take the time.   &nbsp;  [ x ] Makeup  – Just base, eyeliner and blush. &nbsp;  [ x ] In my mouth  - Teeth and tongue. &nbsp;Wouldn’t you know it. &nbsp; There, voilà!

        Whoa, this thing does cool blog stuff.&nbsp; There are colors!&nbsp; Not that I normally use that many colors at all, especially on AIM.&nbsp; I added a poll.&nbsp; I was coming up with names for characters for something I started working on.&nbsp; If I had ten kids, that's what their names would be.&nbsp; Well, I guess I probably wouldn't name my son Cassius.&nbsp; Or my daughter Persephone.&nbsp; But the names are still cool.&nbsp; Can you tell how bored I've been?&nbsp; Hahaha, I'm working in my mommy's office answering the telephone.&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Joslin,&nbsp;Sedberry and Lamkin."&nbsp; I was trying to find a dumb blog survey to do.&nbsp; May end up doing one of those.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahh, here we go.      Name:  Who do you think?       Been in love:  Not really.       done drugs:  Not seriously.       Eaten an entire box of oreos:  Ew, no.       Been on stage:  Yes.       Dyed your hair:  Do it all the time.       Gone to school in your pajamas:  Yes.       Gotten a detention:  Haha, I got lunch detention from Mr. Lucas in seventh grade once. Man, that guy was a DUMB ASS.       Loved someone so much that it made you cry:  Mmm, yeah.&nbsp; Not romantically though.     ( THIS // THAT )  Cold / hot:  Cold.    &nbsp; Blue / red:  I like all the colors!      Rain / snow:  Well, I like both, but I really love thunderstorms the most.       Give / receive:  Must I pick? &nbsp;I like all this stuff.       Wool / cotton:  I’d have to say cotton.       Private school / public school:  Public.       Chocolate milk / plain milk:  Hmm, well, I guess plain. &nbsp;Chocolate milk kinda freaks me out. &nbsp;But seriously, cow milk is actually for baby cows.       Celsius / fahrenheit:  Even though it takes me a minute to figure Celsius out, the metric system always makes more sense and the standard system is crap. &nbsp;Another reason why America is a weird fucking place.       Spring / fall:  Both.       History / science:  History, usually.       Math / english:  I guess English. &nbsp;I love algebra though.       Country / rock:  Unless it’s rugged old bluegrass, definitely rock. &nbsp;Good rock, mind you.       Coke / pepsi:  Coke for life.       Cherry coke / vanilla coke:  Neither. &nbsp;Erlack.       Sprite / 7up:  Sprite, I guess.       Love / lust:  A lot of both works for me.       Sleep / eat:  Sleep, definitely.     ( FRIENDS )  Who do you see most often:  It’s hard to tell in the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to see everyone fairly often. &nbsp;I think the person I’ve seen most lately is Mary Alice.      Who is your most annoying friend:  Do I have to say it?       Who do you e-mail the most:  I really don’t use email, but I guess probably my piano teacher, as sad as that sounds.       Who`s the loudest:  I don’t know. &nbsp;I’m pretty loud myself. &nbsp;Especially with headphones on.       Who`s the shyest:  Well, Joncie was pretty shy when we were growing up, but I don’t think I’d call her shy now.       Who has the best room:  I love all your rooms. &nbsp;I love other people’s houses.       Who`s the most horny:  We’re all REALLY horny, and a few of us aren’t afraid to say it. &nbsp;Come, on. &nbsp;I think you know my theory.       Who do you trust the most:  Among the Enloe kids, I think I’d have to say Sarah. &nbsp;She’s a good listener, which is a hard job. &nbsp;But I trust Mary Alice and the beach girls a lot too. &nbsp;I have more issues trusting guys.       Who`s your best friend:  Don’t have one. &nbsp;Or all my friends are. &nbsp;Either way you look at it.       Favorite friends of the same sex:  I don’t think I can choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of girls my age who I don't like that much, but I’m quite fond of some girls.     ( WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS )  Had a serious talk:  Not really, no.      Hugged someone : Yeah, I hugged my grandfather this morning, haha.       Missed someone : Um, what else happens in the summer?       Gotten along with your parents : Yeah, I’m getting along with my mommy for the time being.       Fought with a friend : Well, not a fight, per se. &nbsp;I was pretty angry yesterday though.       Cried : You want to hear something sad? &nbsp;Yesterday I went to see The King and I, a show I don’t even really like. &nbsp;And I almost cried part of the way through. &nbsp;Wow.       Felt empty : I’m quite familiar with the feeling.     ( DO YOU LIKE TO )  Give hugs : Oh, yes.      Give back rubs : No. &nbsp;Too much work.       Take walks in the rain : Yeah, my mom has to like drag me inside to keep me from getting sick.       Watch tv : Not that much lately. &nbsp;Mostly just silly episodes of I Love the 90s.       Do homework : Actually it really depends on what it is. &nbsp;Usually not, though.       Play in the snow : With other people or the dogs. &nbsp;It’s not fun by yourself. &nbsp;I just find that it’s really really cold.       Stay up all night talking to friends : Oh, yeah. &nbsp;That can be fun with a fun person.       Work out : I live to work out. &nbsp;Live for it.       Talk on the phone : Depends on who it is. &nbsp;I like a nice marathon chat. &nbsp;I’ve conquered my phobia!       Go online : Yes.       Kiss : *smiles*       Do freaky things : What the hell is that supposed to mean? &nbsp;Whoever wrote this thing (some ten-year-old) was really trying hard to be cool.&nbsp;     ( WHICH ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS )  Is most likely to grow up to be a model:  Whichever one sleeps with the modeling agent. &nbsp;Hahaha, just kidding. &nbsp;Kind of.      Have known you the longest:  The two people from school I’ve been in touch with the longest would be Jonc and Dylan.     ( HAVE YOU EVER )  Been to a concert:  Sure have.      Gone Skinny-dipping:  Ha, once.       Ran around naked:  Not to speak of.       Broken a bone:  No.       Cheated on a test:  No, I don’t usually cheat in front of the teacher’s nose.       Ran a marathon:  No.       Met a famous person:  Yeah, but no one awesome.       Bought something and then sold it : I think I have done that. &nbsp;Oh, that reminds me of a story from when I was like three or four.&nbsp; My mom gave my stuffed pig Hilda away before realizing that I still loved the thing. &nbsp;So she had to buy it back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess that's really the other way around.       Gotten drunk:  Not obscenely drunk.       Smoked:  No.       Stalked someone:  No.     ( LOVE )  Single or taken:  Single.      If u were gonna go out with anyone who would it be:  Well, probably someone really annoying and dumb. &nbsp;Yep.     ( EXTRAS )  What is your worst habit : I’ve been told that it’s being too blunt, but right now I think it’s being too sarcastic.      What makes you mad : Well, the main one starts with a B and ends with an ush administration.       Scariest moment : I don’t think I could pinpoint it.       Where are you : Sitting behind the receptionist’s desk at Joslin, Sedberry &amp; Lamkin.       Are you wearing any jewelry : Sure am.

What is your computer desk made of : Wood, so it would seem.        What would you really want to be doing right now : I’m actually ok. &nbsp;I’m making money talking to Becca on IM.       If you were a crayon what color would you be : Probably some shade of pink.     F I R S T S  [First best friend] : Danny the British boy.       [First date]:  Hmm, I guess the movies.
