      Everyday I watch these two dumb doves try to build a nest outside on the window sill. The female will stay in the place where they're hoping the nest will be, and the male will fetch the sticks & materials. Every stick that the male brings goes to the female, is set in its proper place, and then promptly falls to the ground. Their problem is twofold: 1) Poor location - they are trying to set up their dream home on a smooth flat surface that is about as wide as their bodies; 2) Brain power - despite more than a week of trying, they still think they can make it work... this either makes them persistent & committed or as dumb as rocks… I’ll wager on the latter.   This reminds me of a deep thought –    How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol? How about the pillow? It has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have that dangerous beak.

      This is a website... welcome. More specifically, this is   a website authored by someone named ernesto. (See my   profile for slightly more information.)  It's so easy to forget the small things. Traipsing   across this globe for the past few months has impressed   upon me the importance of keeping a record of my   experiences. And, as we all know, it's the nuances and   subtleties of living and the expression of the minutiae   and the finer points that combine to truly capture the   essence of a life. In this website, with the help of the   honorable men and women at Blogger, I will attempt to   capture what it means to live la vida ernesto.    This site, as a secondary purpose, is also for those back   home who know and love me. I have left you in presence   for a time, but I do not want to leave you in spirit. I   hope that in visiting this site you will feel connected   with me in some weird, but non-new age, way.  So, you may have a couple questions...  Q: What should I expect to see here in the future? A: Anything and everything - from a picture of my face,   to a picture of my face next to the face of a crazy dog;   from a description of my spiritual life, to the lyrics of   a song that's been stuck in my head; from the posing of a   controversial question I want your input on, to a   statement of the number of days that my bowels have been   functioning correctly.  Q: What should I not expect to see here?  A: Nonessentials. Don't expect me to respond to silly   questions like "Where are you?" or "What are you doing on   the other side of the world?" or "What is your real   name?" The answers to these questions only provide   distracting and unnecessary static, turning your eyes   away from what's really important (remember, la vida   ernesto?).   As I write, I will use the English style and phraseology   that I use when talking to myself in my head (which I do   quite frequently). This may confuse some of you. I may   even use inside jokes that I share with no living person,   just myself. So, I apologize now for future writing that   may leave you on the outside or make you feel   uncomfortable. This most likely will happen. However,   that being said, it IS my intention that through this   site you folks back home will be able to "feel me," as   they say.   I will post new entries to this site as I am able -   hopefully at least once a week. Unfortunately the   reliability of the internet isn't that great out here...   nothing can be guaranteed.   Peace out!

      Remember Sifl & Olly? Their poetry still rings true:  Tiger Power  You know...  I don't feel keeping tigers as pets is as cool as it seems  with the meat  and the fur  and the nails  and the teeth...  Is that corn between that tigers teeth?  That tiger has corn between his teeth.  How was that tiger eating corn?  What the hell's going on here?  It's not corn?  What it is then?  ...pieces of a raincoat?  I'm sorry...I didn't know.   -- Olly

      The wedding party lived up to the hype... it was pretty kick-ass.   Five things made it memorable:  1- Getting freaked out by a scorpion 2- Singing and dancing out in a private garden till 3:45AM 3- Sleeping overnight in said private garden  4- Eating fruit off the trees for breakfast in the morning 5- Seeing "the marijuana section" of the garden

      I'm way stoke-ed because tonight I leave for a village for another rawkin' wedding party. I think we'll even stay overnight. Rugs will be cut, the dancefloor will be set aflame, and I may even take my shirt off and spin it around my head like a helicoptah (like they do in No'th Carolina).  And don't worry, I will be sure to stay away from any water-based drinks this time.
