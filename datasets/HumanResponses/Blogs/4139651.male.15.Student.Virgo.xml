      Yesterday was my little brother's 12th birthday! To celebrate, we went to 'Kobe: Steak House of Japan' with his friends, Kory and Jack, their parents, and Jack's sister and my good friend Molly. I love their soup, but it give me a horrible aftertaste for the next, oh, 26 hours. Their salad dressing is so amazing I can't describe it, and I had the calamari, salmon, and shrimp. It was all very good.  Uh, right now I'm watch a Star Trek movie. Despite the horrible acting, and other strangeities, I am very inclined to like Star Trek. This episode involves 419 year-old woman who looks like Maya Rudolph has fallen in love with Cptn. Picard. Also, there are these wrinkly people that look like Voldemort. I've decided the title should be Star Trek XXVII: Attack of the Voldermorts...and just as I was typing that the Head-Voldemort screamed madly.  Also, Candy (sophomore VP) and I decided on 'Viva Las Vegas' as the theme for this year's homecoming. For a preview of the possible t-shirt design, click  urlLink http://customink.com/cink/r.jsp?E=cooperlewis%40cox.net&amp;F=kmchc1 . I'm excited.  It looks like the inside of the gym is going to be modeled after the famous casinos. The perimeter will be divided into about 7 panels, each depicted a Casino, like Caesar's Palace, uh, and a bunch of other stuff...Circus, Circus...the medieval one, the Aladdin. Stuff like that. Oh and the lobby will have craps tables and roulette stuff. The breathalizers will be dressed in dealer vests and visors, and if you pass the breathalizer, you'll be able to walk through the Jackpot.  Also, the picture backdrop is the "Chapel-O-Love"

      For those of you who don't know, the adult sponsor of the Blessed Sacrament CYO (Catholic Youth Organization), of which I am Vice President, is called Richard, or Cowboy, Kirkham.  There are three things you have to know about Richard: 1. If it's worth thinking, It's worth saying. 2. He's from Texas. 3. He is the local drama expert, and gossip king.  Basically, Richard's idea of a good CYO Mission Statement is:  "Make Money, Recruit People, Use the Recruits to Make More Money, and by the way, have fun."      So we've got the  richest  CYO in town. But deciding what to do with the money is another story. Enter the discussion about our first meeting.    K, Y'all when's our next meetin' gonna be?     Uh, how bout at the end of August?      How about Labor Day?     That's a retarded idea. Let's meet at the end of August. What're we doing? Bowling!      No.     Not bowling. How about Spoons.     Yes! Spoons is great.     Not spoons...how about Casino night?     No, that's Homecoming theme!     So what?     No casino. Lazer tag!     Yes. Lazer tag!     We discover that lazer tag costs $545 dollars. Big red  X .   Uh...how about spoons?   No. A bigger activity.   How about a carwash?   No!   Softball?   I hate softball.   Dodgeball?   Too sweaty. I'll ruin my hair .  Spoons?   No. Movie?   Heck no. Spoons?   OK .  Sure. But have ice cream.      Geniuses we are: Richard is orange, I'm green, and everyone else is blue.  At any rate. That's our CYO meeting, which is always at a Mexican Place.  Remember: Coloreds is what do our laundry with.

      The United States invaded Iraq under the leadership of George W. Bush after three months of deliberation in the U.N. Security Council. Of the three permanent members that opposed the war, Russia and France both had multibillion dollar trade with the Hussein regime, and China is redder than a maraschino cherry. I don't really give a damn what the French think of the war, and anyone who does needs to realize that the last time the French needed more proof of a threat, it marched into Paris under a German flag, and should also realize that the French are socialistic morons.  So, with the French and Germans bent upon our failure in Iraq, several members of the American left decided to try and stop the war by protesting, and Bush-bashing. Their slogan became, under Michael Moore and others, that our brave men and women had died for nothing. After the WMD intelligence, which had been previously supported by France, Russia, Germany, and the U.N. proved to be 'false,'* the left vamped up their Bush-bashing and their slogan became, "Bush lied, soldiers died...for nothing, for a lie."  The left claims they do this to support the soldiers, but does that make sense? To support the soldiers, but not their cause is tantamout to supporting the Gay Rights Organization, but not supporting gay rights.  Suppose you are in Iraq, serving your country. Every day on the news, you see Michael Moore, Al Franken, and others saying, "Our soldiers are fighting and dying for no reason. They don't need to be over there." Doesn't that minimize your efforts as a soldier?  The fact is, whether the left admits it or not, our brave soldiers overthrew a dictator and liberated a nation. But you won't hear the left say, "Thank you, soldiers, for overthrowing an evil man." And when I say that, the left says, "But that's not the reason they were given."  But you know what? I'm a firm believer in giving these men and women hope, appreciation, and love. The left is giving them none of that. The left is giving them a feeling that they are dying for no reason, that no one appreciates what they've done in Iraq.  Take the example of Lila Limpscomb, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, who is featured in Michael Moore's latest, 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' It seems Ms. Limpscomb initially supported the war and the President, but then recieved word that her son had died, shortly before receiving a letter from her son criticizing President Bush and the war effort. Can you blame him? Everyday he hears that he's basically accomplished nothing in Iraq.  Lila takes this very hard. But Michael Moore is there to manipulate the greiving Ms. Lipscomb into promoting his leftist cause. He could have said, "Lila, I appreciate your son's service. He died honorably and courageously. He answered his country's call, and he helped to remove a brutal dictator." If my brother was killed in Iraq, I would take comfort from that more than Mr. Moore's message of choice, paraphrased. "Yes, Lila, your son died for nothing. He died for a lie, he died to secure oil for corporate fatcats. You only have one way to help his memory...to join the Antiwar effort."  In short, ladies and gentlemen: You can't support our troops by destroying the glory in what they've done, and invalidating the sacrifices they've made in our country's name. If the leftists truly cared about our men and women in uniform, they would put aside political bickering**, which gets nobody anywhere, and support our troops. The bad intelligence is behind us, there's nothing we can do to change that. What we can do is support our troops and glorify their cause. They deserve as much.  *False intelligence? I've got news for you, people. Until we wanted to go to war, NO ONE doubted this intell was false. John Kerry called himself one of the biggest supporters of regime change in Iraq. France, and the rest of the UN 'reprimanded' Saddam frequently for breaking resolution 1441 and producing WMDs. Basically, we let Saddam go totally unchecked for about 3 months while the UN decided to move Weapons Inspectors into Iraq. If you were Saddam, and you knew that Bush would invade the hell out of you if you had weapons, and you had 3 months without anyone watching you (or your Syrian border), What would you do?  **I hate it when I hear people say, "I'll vote for Kerry to spite/remove Bush." It doesn't make sense. Kerry's  foreign policy, until he says otherwise, is exactly the same as President Bush's, minus a few vague remarks about making the US more trustworthy in the world. (This trust will last until the French don't want to deal with a threat, and instead would like to sit around, smoke, and let their armpit hair grow.) Kerry, Bush, and even Nader have all said they would leave the troops in Iraq. So why the hell vote for Kerry?

      My friend Molly Martin graciously invited me to have dinner at the family farm tonight. There were about six of we soph-o-mores there and we were hanging out until it got really dark, when I had the GREAT idea to learn how to do cheerleading stunts from the girls.  I basically grab Meghan's waiste and throw her up on my shoulders. Then Andrea decided to try and she landed on my neck and I was starting to feel like a fag so I left.  Also, the Zoo that I went to today didn't have any turkeys as advertised. I was hoping to see some at the farm, but they only had cows, and I didn't see them either. I'm come to the conclusion that the Evil Ducks drove the turkeys away.  The Evil Ducks stand near the African cow, glaring at it maliciously, poised to charge like the Orcs during the Battle of Helms Deep. I have a feeling the African cow could handle them, but I think the turkeys might have been overwhelmed.  Which reminds me of my old house in Castle Rock, Colorado. The conifers around my house housed the local wild turkey population. I used to climb the trees and sit under the turkeys.  Also, deer occasionally grazed outside our kitchen window. And there were coyotes too. They killed my dog, Callie, who was named after McCallister Street in San Francisco (which is where we bought her). McCallister street is also in the deeply gay neighborhood of San Francisco. My parents were worried that we might get AIDS from it, but in the word of our Vet, "Well, what are you going to use the dog for?" I was too little to remember it, but apparently the dog breeders' house was adorned with gay pornography and man-thong calenders. I guess the breeders didn't notice our "Reagan Rocks!" bumper sticker...  Today I converted 3 people to veritaserum.com!

       The Sedgwick County Zoo, which has no polar bears, recently opened the "Downing Gorilla Forest" which is full of large yellow fans to keep people cool, and has things like the "Ndugu Motel" and "Sunari Snacks".....authentic African names for overpriced leopard-shaped water bottles and green "Mighty Gorilla" t-shirts. As hard as those shops were to skip, I made the sacrifice and headed over to the multi-million dollar scenery...that no animals live on. Then I saw a sign advertising "Pygmy Hippopotamuses" and I was very impressed that our zoo had these rare creatures that are found in two zoos on this continent. Well...it turns out it was a joke, and that the hippo I was marveling at was really a bronze statue. I was so irritated by this that I didn't enjoy the meerkats at all.       At any rate, I saw the tortoise, Rocket, get fed as well as a huge snake and the otters. But the most exciting thing at the zoo wasn't the Reptile House or the Pachyderm House...it was Tropical Rainforest.      I was in the tropical rainforest watching the vampire bats drink blood, when I noticed the Liberal Exhibit next to the bat cave had a real, live liberal woman at it! (How exciting and dangerous!)      The Liberal Exhibit is a sign that muses the question: How long would it take at the present rate of destruction to destroy a section of rainforest as big as this building? Press the button to find out. (7/10 of a second!!! DUN DUN DUN!)The liberal woman was educating her young children about Evil Corporate America killing blue iguanas and destroying Mother (not Father) Rainforest. Her kids reacted like I would...running over to scare the Red-Breasted Pigeons during the middle of her rant.      "Excuse me, Miss...I couldn't help overhearing your lecture..."      "Yah. Well, I just think it's ridiculous how those corporate hogs are destroying the environment to fill their pockets, you know?"      "Well, would you rather have the yellow-spotted butterfly have to relocate or would you rather see those 'corporate fatcats' lay off those poor Brazilian loggers and force them to move their wives and children into tin huts in the jungle?"      "Uh...that's pretty...naive...oversimplified..."      "And by the way, the Blue Iguana lives in Indonesia, a country that is currently ruled by Islamic fascists. But we wouldn't want to overthrow a dictator without the U.N. Security Council's approval. We better start 'Blue Iguana Inspections'...I bet those will convince the evil dictators to change their ways.      "I don't know how you could be so insensitive...I'm speechless."     ***  Damn right she was speechless.

      Wow. I definitely just watch the "Tonight Show" with Jay Leno, and I have decided that I really, really like Gov. Schwartzenegger(sp)--He's living proof that Republican economic procedure is the way to go. Well, I think that when he's done with his Governorship, he should for Senator against Diane Feinstein, and beat her mercilessly.  The Wild Boys were also on the show. Chris Pontius was like agitating scorpions on his face, but they wouldn't sting him much. Nice Scorpions. Steve-O did a big fiery backflip, which was pretty damn cool.  Can't wait till the RNC!

      I, the Green Robin, will attempt to reveal as much about myself as possible without revealing my identity to my enemies...who include liberals, the creators of Japanimation, the French, but not Ralph Nader...whoa! I almost revealed my political preference there.  At any rate, I will be getting my driver's license in about six weeks. So look out for a blue-and-white 1966 VW Microbus covered with conservative and Harry Potter bumperstickers.  Which brings me to my next point: Harry Potter is the best thing that happened to this planet since Ronald Reagan. Can I get an Amen?  Ok...so...about me! Right. I have  voracious  brown hair, and  death-defying  sideburns. And a melanoma (small harmless tumor) on my lower lip. Also, my hair used to be purple.  Time for a list!   Five People who I don't know, but I wish lived in my living room:  1.Emma Watson 2. Sean Hannity 3. Anne Coulter 4. Jon Stewart 5. Gideon Yago  Did y'all know that handing cookies out at the mall is illegal?
