      Ya know, here lately I have noticed alot of shit n oddly, I have seen others vent so I havent.  But I am gonna say my piece to now.  A few things that piss me off..  No matter what u do, u cant win.  People either use who you date or dont date, you issues with people they are friends with or petty shit that really doesnt even affect their daily life.  Now, why the fuck am I going to go out of my way to tell someone stupid shit about THEIR choices, when it doesnt even remotely affect me.  Coming to me n asking will get u my opinion voluntarily, but other then that...I dont give two shits.   Over the past few weeks I have come to find out about certain cunts on yahoo that shouldnt even be allowed computer access.  They need to log off their comps n preferably, while still plugged in, take a bath with them.  As some of u know, my ex I used to live with up north, proposed to me not too long ago.  I accepted, it isnt often u can say you're with your first love, on both people's parts.  Now of course, little cunts are coming out of the wood work.  They feel the need to mention about how he was while we was broke up.  HELLO, we was broke up, why does it matter to me?  Obviously, anyone who knows him knows he talks alot of shit to females but its very RARE he does anything about it.  And the whole time, tellin certain people he wanted us back together but had too much pride.  Now, you would think that "friends" would be happy for u when things go good in your life.  But no, instead they decide to act jealous n make comments thinkin it will phase u or maybe affect your relationship in some way.  Heres a reality check, I know fantasy can be fun, but reality will kick your ass in the end, n I wanna be there to laugh.  Making the comments n acting like we are still in high school only makes u look jealous.  Quite frankly, it gives us all a good laugh.   So keep it up, b/c for some of u fucks in 1, I KNOW your life aint fuckin GRAND CENTRAL, so keep up.....least we have already grown up n done what we need to do to get our life straight.  If you arent happy for me, ill stamp I CARE on my ass n u can stare at it while I hand u a spork to eat my ass with, your opinion matters please insert here ~~> _  Next, Nikke makes some good points in her entry.  People who actually have nothing else to do but sit in front of the comp all day, talkin shit n trying to ruin other people....should be given a razor blade with a note attached that says "Remember, north and south work better then east to west."  Heh, if it doesnt show I am fed up with people.  When I dont have the net I wont miss it.  I get online n pickin at people here n there or arguing is good for a laugh sometimes, but I also have a life OFF the comp.  I work, have responsibility here n spend time with Jai or go out with friends.  As far as I am concerned half these fucks could drop off the face of the earth tomorrow n I wouldnt even know unless someone pointed out their sorry ass wasnt around.  Very few people do i actually give two shits about.  I think I can count on both hands who they are, maybe use some toes if I am feeling extra nice.   Then there is the people who let yahoo RUN their lives n make shit talking a sport.  Like Nikke said, if you're gonna put effort into trying to fuck with something make sure its true n u can prove it.  I love the people tho, who cant establish chat drama from real life.  If it affects me on a personal level with someone I know off the comp n hang out with, thats real life.  If i have met u once or not at all n we arent even really considered friends...its chat drama.  Peoples opinions mean very little to me.  I wasnt put here to impress anyone or make anyone happy except myself.   As far as people who think what they do n say never gets found out.  If you HONESTLY think that, then u need to log off right now n sell your computer.  On Yahoo there is hardly ever secrets.  When you backstab someone, give it a wk before they know n have your ass on a hitlist.  A few bitches have found out how far I will go before I hit my point with personal drama.  I try to keep personal shit out of chat...mainly when it comes to me n Jai.  But  had unfnished business with some sluts who decided to wedge a knife in my back ever so deeply.  They didnt seem to like getting called out in front of evr1 n made out to be the whore they claimed I was.   If you're going to try n piss me off, atleast make sure I care enough to let u bother me.  Otherwise, save your effort, u will need it to defend yourself against me later.   No one on this comp picks my friends or my boyfriend for me.  Dont like who I talk to or date then fuck off?  Friends get to each other, its part of being friends, n ppl bitch.  But bitching n wishng ppl to die n then being civil to them is kinna procrastinating isnt it.  I have let alot of grudges go, b/c they were petty.  But when u hit home or hit a major nerve...u better hope n pray I decide you're not worth the effort.  VERY few people on here have seen what a fuckin cunt I can be when pushed.  And the ones that have will tell u, its not lovely.   Hating people just b/c of who they date is about as pimp as people who let yahoo run their life.   Now granted, it does make me laugh when I can go into the room n bitches shut the fuck up when I start talkin or leave when me n Jai are mentioned.  All that does is prove my point.  Most of them are the "every guy wants me n im so fucking pimp" types that we all laugh at when a guy turns them down for another chic.  Regardless of who I date, a TRUE friend wont dislike me any less, they will be happy for me n still talk to me.  They wont bash me in pm thinking I wont find out, they wont stop talkin to me b/c I am happy where I am n they think they have better choices for me already drawn out.  As I said earlier, dont like my choices....STAY OUT OF MY LIFE N EAT MY ASS AN YOUR WAY OUT, thanks please drive thru.  I dont need petty bullshit, I have enough stupid cunts breeding.  And Nikke, if people wanna take the time to make names about u n go into chat sayin shit, it only shows how much u mean to them for them to take that time n effort WITHOUT having proof of shit.  Least make sure u can back up what u say about others.  We have all made names for others, but usually with grounds n proof, otherwise its kinda pointless isnt it?  Jealousy is something that wont ever go away...but if ppl wanna swear up n down your jealous of them or others.........its kinda like pointing a finger at themselves.  I had a bitch say I was jealous of her, im trying to figure out why when I can atleast have a relationship...shes a fuck n run.  Whats to be jealous of?  Nothing really.  End of story.  For anyone who doesnt like my choices or supports what I do....go find a tall tree n some short rope...your opinion means as much to me as your life cycle.  For those who do, regardless of how often we talk or whatnot....its cool.  I know you're there n I know you're thoughts n opinions.  On that note......im done.......bastards

      ok so I thought I would give this a try...I already have a journal at livejournal.com/gods_tiny_joke....but hey...guess this one wouldnt hurt either since everyone knows that link.  Its all nikke's fault tho....lol.  Anyway...um I dunno what to say since I already did my other journal today.  So um yeah...have I ever told people how much I hate them?  I recently found out about someone who was supposed to be my friend...sticking a few knives through my back...that rocked!  She didnt like it too much tho when I busted her out on it n embarassed her in front of everyone.  But thats what she gets, screw me over n screw u over twice as much.  Ok well um thats all for now:D
