      Just a quick post to say that no matter how beat down I am from my job, I still love Fridays.  Even better, the Friday before a three day weekend.  Wish we were able to come to the festivities tomorrow, but we going down to visit Mike's mom in Kingsland, TX.  Not a lot going on there, but they do have a lake that we can relax at.  Hope to see everyone soon!!

      I finally live in a real neighborhood.  Filled with houses, driveways, trees and sixteen year old boys.  This afternoon, I decided to take Isabel for a walk to check out the sites.  We ventured out, Isabel in a blue outfit (why do I insist on dressing my DAUGHTER in blue?) and me in my wife beater and yoga pants.  It was hot outside, so hot that my deodorant failed within seconds of opening the front door and my hair immediately stuck to my forehead.  30-minutes after our departure, we headed back.  A sixteen year old boy stops me.   Boy:   How old is he?  She?  Me:   (Damn blue outfit!)  10 months.  Boy:   Wow.  You sure bounced back from that pretty quick.  I continued towards the house with my sweaty armpits and matted hair.  And I shook my ass just a bit more.

      Hello Everyone.  I hope this "blog" finds everyone well.  Hello to Petty Cash whose post I read earlier!  Just to let everyone know, I was in a wreck yesterday...nothing serious, although it did total the other ladies car (she rear ended me!).  I am a little sore but more so in the check book because of what all this is going to cost me when it is all added up.  All is well with me.  Jamie and I had a good visit and I am looking forward to my trip there in June to apartment and job hunt.  We will see how good  my seeking skills are in a foreign state..any words of advice for those who have been in the job market lately?  Well, I don't know what else to write so I guess I will post and move on.  I would like to mention that I agree with Steph with the whole Toby Keith thing...although he did thank God (if he really meant it) and that goes a long way with me!  Have a great day everyone and I will see those of you who are attending the Buffett celebration on Saturday!!!! Yeah parrot heads!

      I don't know about you guys, but I really have no patience for stupid people... especially when you have to work with them.  And, while I'm on that note.. what's up with Toby Keith winning all of those country music awards?  Not that I care that much, but come on. Is that really the direction country music is going? I guess being a redneck has finally paid off for someone.   And, on the subject of music... who said, "Yeah, it'll be a good idea to change the Eagle to Sunny 97.1"?  Ugh.... Two oldies stations. Right in a row. I guess Ron Chapman has another station to go to if 98.7 ever gives him the boot.

      A continuation of the previous  urlLink "My honey-do list" :  15 - What's with the babysitting?  I'm a big girl, I don't need to call when I'm out of town to tell you every time I take a crap.  16 - "How was your flight?" while paying absolutely no attention, would be so much more appropriate than an "Oh.  Hey.  What's up".  17 - It wasn't an excuse, I really am on my period!  18 - I want to volunteer at church for 1 hour every Sunday.  I understand that you want us to spend our weekends together, but don't throw a hissy and then, 30-minutes later inform me that you'll be watching racing ALL DAY this Sunday!  19 - Again, with the farting.  Is it necessary?  20 - 7:30-5:30 with an hour lunch does not equal a TWELVE hour day!

      I'm in a wedding in November.  This was my choice.  I could have gone to Las Vegas for the bachelorette party but since money or lack of, was holding me back from doing both, I choose to share in the wedded bliss with my very good friend from high school.  We have been through a lot together so I thought, we can party together anytime, how many times is she really going to get married, right?!  The bridesmaid dresses came in, and to toot my horn, I LOOK GOOD.  Granted, I can stand to loose a little weight and maybe tone up the arms (the dress is strapless) but over all I look good.  It is a beautiful dress, with simple embroidered and diamond detailing across the breast*.   Here is where the rethinking comes in:  The jewelry.    While some would think this is not something to have a coronary about, I WOULD.  PICTURE THIS:    The color of the dress is periwinkle (something of a cross between light blue and light purple). Let me stress again LIGHT COLORS.    *Remember the simple style of the dress and color of the dress.    The jewelry:  The earrings are small DARK PURPLE METALLIC stud's in the shape of roses with a necklace to match.  A drop down necklace. Now remember the dress already has embroidered crap on the breast so to pair that with DARK PURPLE METALLIC rose-shaped necklace, well it's just too much. I should say that only one bridesmaid was asked her opinion, and it wasn't me!  But still....dark metallic purple on a light blue/purple dress??!!  Why are brides allowed to pick out anything for their wedding, if they don't know what looks good??!!  And why ask another bridesmaid just her opinion instead of getting all opinions?? Vegas is looking so much better now....

      I'm in San Diego right now.  BEAUTIFUL!  And the weather!  Ahh, the weather...  My boss and I spent a day in La Jolla -->  Beaches, parks and shopping.  We stood on the beach (more like rocks) and listened to the water crashing.  I had the sudden urge to have a man there (yes, I actually thought about Josh.)  I turned to my BOSS and said:  "Hey, Michelle ... do you wanna make out?"  I was a little disappointed when she said "NO!"

      Well, I'm no longer looking for employment outside of my current job.  A few things I had forgot to take into consideration, is the debt I accrued here while taking Grad classes.  My job payed for them, and to pay back, I have to work here another year.  Add that on top of those five years I am required to work in the child welfare field, to pay back some grant money I received in college, there you go.  No way I'm willing to force us to have to pay money back, when I can just stay employed here for another two years, until I am paid off!  So, that sucks.  I'm working on new techniques to make me like my job again, let me know if you have any....

      This weekend, Spencer and I headed South on Saturday for UT's graduation. A friend, Kelly, graduated and is moving to Chicago (tomorrow) to start a new job. It was one of those things we weren't really jazzed about doing, but we went anyway.  Looking back on the weekend now, I'm so glad we did.  Kelly's parents threw a dinner party on Friday to celebrate Kelly graduating. (Her "good friends"--you'll see why I use the "" just a few lines down--came in town from Houston to see Kelly and to say goodbye before she moves.) After the dinner get-together, Kelly and her friends were going to head to 6th street. Kelly had to drop off her parent's at their hotel before going out so her friends went on ahead. When Kelly--the girl who everyone should be celebrating with--finally arrived to 6th street, her friends didn't answer their phones and the ones who did wouldn't leave the bars they were at (which had wait lines 50-people long) to meet up with her. So, she wandered the street for about 30min by herself until she found another person to take her home.  Those same friends drove back to Houston--without saying goodbye, good luck--so they could go to a party Saturday night.   Spencer and I showed up Saturday to go out with her and her friends after Commencement. When we called Kelly to meet up, she said, "..it's only you guys going, everyone else went home." So the three of us headed out for drinks and had a great time--it was nice to catch up. Kelly told us about the night before and was irritated about the situation, but didn't let on too much. But it really bothered me that her friends cared too much about the good time they were having, instead of Kelly. Shouldn't they be celebrating with her? Isn't that the reason why they came into town? Don't they remember she's moving away?  Every once and a while, it's nice to be reminded how lucky I am to have the people in my life that I do.

       Scene:   Husband and wife chat gingerly over dinner.  Wife is due to leave town the next morning.   Husband:   When are you leaving again?  Wife:   Tomorrow morning.  Husband:   Tomorrow?  Oh.  Where are you going again?  Wife:   San Diego.  Wife, frustrated because this is the same conversation she's had with husband every day for the past week, then turns to the camera holding up a box of Q-tips.   Wife:   Does your husband ever listen to you, ladies?  No?  Mine neither.  I recommend Q-tip brand cotton swabs to encourage your man to clean his ears more often.  Scene closes.

      Ughhhh I am just going to vent for a bit! I only have a week and a few days left of work, we have worked till 7pm M-W for the past two weeks. We just got an email we are working till 7:00 this Monday and Tuesday also.  No we don't get paid overtime.  Why it really sucks is b/c I get 15 days vacation. I have used 10. I haven't "EARNED" 10 since I am leaving the first of June. Therefore I am getting docked 3.5 days. Fine. I knew that was the rule. I should have called in sick more often rather than take VAC days for school stuff. I was trying to be honest.   I have only had one sick day this year.  So anyway, here I am working over time for nothing, I gave 5 weeks notice, which I think was very nice, and I am getting docked 3.5 days! AND to add to that I find out today that another girl that is leaving took another sick day today for an interview so she won't be docked vacation. And one of our supervisors knows she is doing this. I call bullshit! :) This place sucks.

      1/6th of an hour 1/144th of a day 1/1,008 of a week 1/52,416th of a year  Seems pretty insignificant, huh?  Last night, the husband decided he wanted pizza for dinner.  I called and ordered while he took a shower.  When he finished, I prepared to leave to pick the pizza up.   Husband:   You going to take Isabel?  Me:   (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  IT WOULD TAKE ME LONGER TO GET HER IN AND OUT OF THE CAR THEN IT WOULD TO PICK UP THE PIZZA!)  I'll be back in about 10 minutes.  Husband:   (Sigh)  Oh, that's fine, I guess I'll take care of her.  For the record, I was back in 7 minutes.  When I got back, Isabel was in bed and he was lounged in the recliner flipping the remote.  So, really, he only had to take care of her for probably 3 minutes before putting her to bed.  And how difficult is it to take care of a 10-month old for THREE MINUTES???

      What a great idea! I have been meaning to write to everyone anyways...  It seems like ages since Caroline was here (Hawaii for those that don't know me) but I got a job/car/more room in the house - Matt has been gone again ;(  First to Korea and now in Thailand. We don't get to talk as much, so it makes it harder to be alone.  My job is fun, I am an episcopal church secretary (hush, no laughing).  The priest is a self-professed ex-hippie that says shit more than I thought a priest was allowed.  There is also a preschool and a psycho director that has everyone pulling their hair out... I won't go into details or Terri will never send Isabel to daycare.  I love my car (Caroline, I got rid of the turkey) it is the American Idol car... a white Ford Escape.  It's cute, until my friend's husband decided to puke inside the back!  So long new car smell!  So it's just me and the girls and we sit at home and watch bad TV.  I do have to tell you that they are PSYCHO about Jasmine Trias if any of you follow American Idol... yes, bad TV.  Since this is blog, I'll cut it off, miss you guys soooooo much. Jess

      The main reason we want to do this is because we all see each other so rarely, but are still curious about what's going on!  A dinner once a month is great, but we each only get about 20 minutes to give an update on ourselves.  This is a great forum to give all the dirty details!  So, onto the rules...  1.  VERY IMPORTANT - What happens in Blog, stays in Blog.   2.  No boys allowed - that means our boys, and any boys who may tell our boys. Any other boys are welcome to visit and actually we encourage it. We might learn something.  3.  Stephanie and Terri, for now, have "administrative" access.  All this means is that we have the power to make changes to the template and edit/delete ALL posts.  However, you can edit your OWN posts.  4.  Have a question?  Ask away!  We have married and single girls, moms, working and (sorry Mary) laid off girls, homeowners and apartment dwellers, and so on, and so on.  Maybe you'll learn a little more than you would've if you just kept it to yourself. **There is way to leave comments on someone's post - this is perfect for answering questions.  5.  Let Terri know if you have any favorite websites.  She'll be adding these to the sidebar for those who may be interested.  6.  Do you know of other girls who would like to be join us?  Let Stephanie or Terri know and we'll send invitations!  7.  You don't have to be a creative type!  Just tell us what's going on (i.e., Isabel is up to six teeth - is sufficient enough).  8.  BE AS CREATIVE AS YOU WANT!  Don't hesitate to add a little flair to your posts.  This is a great way to emerge from your shell and have some fun.  9.  Lastly, ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!

      Well after three months of trying and trying (okay that was the fun part) we finally did it. I am only 6 weeks pregnant but I am counting the days down already. This time I already have morning sickness but in the afternoon(??) and I am so tired chasing Austin around all day. My back is killing because I have to carry a 27lb boy around when he is not running around. Needless to say we are so excited. Our plan is to have the two kids out of the house by the time we are 50 so we can buy a boat and live on it (no house to maintain). At the rate we are going maybe it will come true!! Well I must go nap now before Austin wakes up from his. Hope all is well back in Dallas!

      According to  urlLink this , a "low self-monitor" is defined as "[someone who] stays true to his/her own values and opinions no matter who may be listening.  They act and talk as they truly feel and believe."  According to me, it is defined as "my boss".  I've worked for this woman for three years and I think the only reason I've been able to tolerate her is because she lives 1000 miles away.  However, for the past two months, I've seen her an average of 2-3 times a month, not to mention the emails and phone calls that are too numerous to count.  This past week, I had the joy of spending 2.5 days with her and a couple of our clients in Chicago doing depth interviews ... and I've never felt more tortured in my life.  The following are just a few of the things our clients and I had to hear (and sometimes endure) from her this week...  - SHE made me book a cheap hotel room for the clients and me, a Holiday Inn.  When the clients complained about it, she blamed me.  - I was accused of offending one of our respondents.  When I explained that I did no such thing, she went on to explain that I DID AND NEEDED TO BETTER HANDLE MYSELF.  When I explained again that the respondent left with a smile on his face, she says, "Oh, well, I wasn't really paying that much attention anyway, so maybe you're right."  To top it off, this needless reprimanding happened IN FRONT OF THE CLIENT.  - She kept asking me if I was tired and that if I needed her to, she could do a few of the interviews.  When I finally gave in and let her handle a couple of the interviews, THE CLIENT asked that I finish the rest.  And she had the gall to say that I needed a lot more training to polish my skills.  - My interviews lasted from 7am to 9pm every day.  And SHE decided, at the last minute and without asking me, that she wanted to book interviews DURING MY LUNCH, just to make sure we hit quota.  Right before (her and the clients) lunch break on the last day, she says to me, "I sure hope lunch gets here quick so you don't have to eat it cold."  - Just one of her numerous stories about her children ... "Michael is a headbanger, he bangs his head on the walls.  The walls are so bloody, but I've been too lazy to clean it up."   Who talks about this shit AND TALKS ABOUT IT IN FRONT OF STRANGERS?!?   - Another story about her children ... "I told him that he had better be in bed when I got home because I was so tired.  If he wasn't in bed, then he was going to be grounded indefinitely."  This kid was not in trouble, she was just being selfish because  she didn't want to deal with him.   - It was raining in Chicago on my last day.  She informed me over and over and over, that I should expect to be several hours delayed.  No big deal, but she went on and on for a good five minutes.  I finally said "thanks" and walked away.  Then she follows after me and says, "I'm not trying to be mean, I just want you to be prepared, because..."   Oh good God!  Shutup!   I get to finish up these interviews next week.  And I know there is indeed a God, because she won't be there.

      No, I'm not getting married anytime soon...or engaged. It was just a random thought that crossed my mind last weekend. I was at the boyfriend's family reunion in Oklahoma and I couldn't help but think, "Who are  these  people?" and, "How exactly is  he  related to them?"  Maybe it was the lack of alcoholic beverages at a family function or that it was humid as hell and I couldn't think straight. I know everyone has "those people" in their family--I'll be the first to say there are several in mine, but they're so much easier to tolerate when you share the same blood. Okay, maybe not...but they're still family. All I know is that if I hear one more bad joke about how OU is better than UT the doctor says my twitch will start back up.  Oh, and then there was the cousin who kept making jokes about Spencer's shirt (a trendy piece I picked out for him at the Gap that I thought looked quite nice).   As I remember correctly, this particular cousin was wearing a lemon yellow t-shirt with the word POLO stretched across his chest and bright blue & white plaid shorts-- didn't that go out of style in the 80s? --but then again I could've been wrong because the gold jewelry around his neck, wrists (yes wrists with an "s"), and pinky ring might have obstructed my view. So, I made a joke about his mullet and shut him up pretty quick.  Only 359 days left until the next one. I can't wait.

      Thank you  urlLink Stephanie  for the  urlLink inspiration  ...  Josh and I went to a party last night for a friend's (please note, that after this particular evening, I consider him Josh's friend and not so much mine) 30th birthday.  However, after witnessing the stupidity of the evening, I think it was more of his 18th birthday party.  Within 20 minutes of our arrival, we were bombarded with stories of sex, illegitimate babies, sex, obnoxious screaming and, did I mention the sex talk?  All these people could talk about was SEX!  There brains were ill-equipped to handle any other type of information except ... you guessed it, SEX.  One particular story had the punchline of "I was taking the girl home afterwards, and I totally forgot her name.  Haha, I thought it was so funny I called her Mulva, you know, from Seinfield."  Yeah, I get it, and you're an idiot.  Then there was another story about screwing all the sales managers at her particular work.  But they weren't all in the same night, so that doesn't make her a slut at all.  Oh yeah, AND she was drunk with a three-month old baby at home, so she had to leave because the baby should be waking up shortly.  Thrilling to know that this little girl would probably have to cry herself back to sleep since her mother is a drunken whore.  Then there was the bottle of Goldschlager, which I found out this evening was invented by God because if you take out the L and the SCHLAGER, well that spells GOD!  So enlightening.  Then there was a bottle of MD2020, and a bottle of Colt 45 (yes, you read correctly), and a bottle of Crown, and another bottle of MD2020, and a bottle of Everclear, and several bottles of vodka and more beer than I could count.  Needless to say, the party guests were trashed ... Josh and I were not.  And we made it out of there with several cases of free beer.  Thanks!  Dumbasses.

      He's an orthopedic surgeon.  And I find myself blessed to have known him, even if only for a short time.  It was about eight weeks ago when he walked into the waiting room to tell me the surgery had gone well, much better than anticipated.  I didn't hear anything else he had to say, as I was too busy studying his dashing good looks.  Tall and handsome with piercing green eyes, his words made me feel like I was floating on air.  For that moment in time, I was the only person in the room.  Okay, who am I kidding?  Dr. Singleton is effing hot!  He did Josh's surgery, and yes, I still feel blessed to have known him, not because Josh has healed up so well, but because he is SO EFFING HOT!  And I thank God that I got to see him one last time today - he's moving to South Carolina.   Why, why must You take him away???   I had to force myself to breathe through the whole appointment.  I actually had to force myself not to let out that nervous laughter that I tend to do around a man who is SO EFFING HOT!    Sorry, did I already mention how hot he is?  His eyes, his smile, his hands.  To know the kind of handiwork his hands can do in such small crevices ... hold on, I need a moment alone ...

      Well it's funny after I read Terri's post about romance, I happened to look over at the "recipe" on the wall in our office. It was given to me at one of my showers. I had almost forgotten it was there.  But I noticed it this morning and thought it might be a good time to post it.  Think about it, all of it. Even if you are not married, most of it can help in relationships for every one of us. Share it with your other half. Remember what is important to you and in life, and don't spend much time on what is not.   Recipe for a Happy Marriage  1 cup of consideration 1 cup of courtesy 2 cups of milk of human kindness 1 gallon of faith in God and each other 2 cups of praise 1 small pinch of in-laws 1 reasonable budget 1 generous dash of cooperation 2 teaspoons pure extract of "I am sorry" 1 cup of contenment 1 cup each of confidence and encouragement 2 children at least 1 large or several small hobbies 1 cup of blindness to each other's faults  "Flavor with frequent portions of recreation and a dash of happy memories. Stir well and remove any specks of jealousy, temper or criticism. Sweeten well with generous portions of love and keep warm with a steady flame of devotion. Never serve with a cold shoulder or hot tongue."

      So-neither one of you has posted on our blog, yet.  Where are you?  I see you around, you reference posts on the blog, Kim has even had a whole post dedicated to her by Terri, but still, we do not see you posting....

      Marriage has problems.  It isn’t always happy or exude a fairytale existence.  But that doesn’t mean I’m anti-marriage.  I’m just sometimes anti-MY-marriage.  When discussions of divorce and child custody come up ... well, that’s some serious shit.  I have my own lawyer and am now well versed in these types of laws.  Quite frankly, I’m far too young for this.    So Josh and I had a LOOONG heart to heart last week.  Did the talk work?  I don’t know, only time will tell.  But it has to be an effort from both of us and while I feel like I’ve been trying to fix things for quite some time, I feel Josh has sloughed on his part.  And it took me scaring the shit out of him to get through to him.  Stephanie knows a lot of detail about our relationship and she’s shared a bit of it with Spencer.  He asked her,  "Do they ever do anything romantic for each other?"   I was floored because, well, it’s been awhile.  We’ve been so mad at each other for so long, that we’ve forgotten what that means.  The other day, I mentioned to Josh that he should get me flowers.  Why?  Because I like them.  That’s it, just because I like them.  Last night, when I got home, he handed me a bouquet of daisies ... just because.  And he got some GOOD lovin' ... see how it works?

      Well, I found out in New Orleans this weekend that representatives are trying to pass a bill to make sagging your pants against the law. You know...the underwear showing, jeans around the knees, or even a little bum cleavage--both guys and girls.  Perpetrators would have to perform several days of community service and/or pay a fine of up to $175.   urlLink http://www.theadvertiser.com/newsupdate/html/9D1E0391-7922-4D26-B317-35D2F438FB75.shtml   I just thought it was interesting that so much effort was going into passing this bill while girls still flash their boobs or live sex shops still operate.  Seems a little back asswards.  Excuse the pun.

       I am happy to add to Kim's good news that I also have a job!!! Some of you already know but I thought I would share with the rest of you.  I will soon be known as Mrs. Howard to some 4th graders at Lynn Hale Elementary in Arlington!  This is also where Kelly Shehorn and Nicole Pool are 6th grade teachers.   I was offered the job last Thursday, a few days after my interview!  I haven't officially signed the paperwork though so that makes me a little nervous till then! :)

      Have I ever mentioned how proud I am of all of my friends?  You guys never fail to amaze me with each of your achievements.  Whether it be children, moving to a new town far away, or choosing a different career path, you all make me so proud to say that you're MY FRIENDS!  It was at my 25th birthday get together at my parents that my mom looked around the room and reminded me just how lucky I am to have found each of you.  Many of us received this email from Kim today:   "I just wanted to let everyone know that I am now a fully certified teacher and that I also signed a contract to teach 4th grade in Desoto ISD at Cockrell Hill Elem."   Kim, wishing you the best of luck!

      I've never been there, Heaven that is, but I can only imagine this is what it will be like ... atleast for me (and probably Angela, except hers would have a lot more shoes).  I just got back from Minneapolis, MN last night.  Whoo-hoo?  What was so exciting?  The MALL OF AMERICA, of course!  We pulled into the parking lot and I heard God calling my name.  The doors opened and I heard harps in the background.  And so many rooms filled with angels that wanted to wait on me, ME!  Atleast three levels of stores galore.  There were roller coasters, swings, water games and much, much more.  We shopped and shopped.  Nine West, Macy's, The Limited,  IS THAT COACH OVER THERE?!   The stores were everywhere.  And we were only able to hit about 1/3 of the mall.    I want to go back!  I want to move in!  I want to spend my life's savings - all $200 of it!  Oh HEAVEN, please take me away!

      I have to say that I have some of the most creative friends around.  I have to say that Terri's post are the most random, yet creative to read.  I almost feel like I am in your head when I read these...scary thought.  I don't really have anything creative or worthwile to contribute today other than a hello.  I will be leaving for North Platte (just a visit) in a few weeks to job and apartment hunt...any job or apartement seeking advice out there?  Well.  That is all for me for now.  I should work some time today.  Denise and emailed away half of my morning so I guess I should earn my keep for the rest of the morning!  Have a great week! BR  By the way...is anyone interested in getting a group together for Shreveport this summer??????

      At work, we have monthly educational meetings on various topics.  This months topic:  Sexual Harassment.   Yesterday:  While driving around, Angela and I saw a guy that we work with and I honked.  I explained to him later that I just couldn't resist honking at such a handsome man.  I think I even giggled when I said it.   Today:  I felt a bug on my foot.  I yelled to the guy across the hall, for all to hear -  "Randy, I need a man!  And I need a man now!"   Yeah, I'm going to jail.

      My little brother graduated from Birdville High School last weekend!!  I was the proudest big sis in the whole convention center.  When we first arrived, I had to find the best seats.  With my camera in one hand, I dragged Aaron and my family with the other.  As soon as we sat down the music began......  When Brian, my brother, marched out I took at least 10 pictures!!  Once all 380 students were seated, it took all I had to keep my tears back (a few found there way down my cheek).  I'm just so proud!!  How did he grow up so freaking fast???  He used to be this little curly headed boy that called me "Sister".  I know that everyone has heard me brag about my brothers at some point, so I'm sure most of you understand how excited I get when they accomplish something this important.  (of course, I think them winning one of their baseball games is a big deal)  I started thinking about how little Brian used to be and all the wonderful memories.  It really hit me how fast time flies.... Brian FINALLY walked accross the stage (he's a "R").  I clapped and yelled probably making a fool of myself.  I made Aaron take the rest of the pictures because I was too busy cheering and didn't want to miss anything.  Terri will really appreciate this blog because she's known Brian since he was 7.  I just wanted to share my one of my greatest weekends with everyone.

      This is so awesome getting to read and talk to everyone back in Big D!!  Things are crazy here in Florida. The hubby is out of town for the week so I am redecorating the house okay the main areas at least. My neighbor and I were up tell 3am painting. Not really sure what we were thinking since we both have kids that wake up by 8:30 in the morning. And the red wine did not help. But the walls look good. Of course I had to get up and take Austin (who will be one next week) to swim lessons and then on the way home ran out of gas. Thank god some of my friends don't work so they could bring me a gas tank. I think it is going to be one of those weeks were I just want to go back to bed and wake up next week.   It is already hotter than heck out here but at least the ocean feels good. Anytime you want to come and visit we have a spare room for now!!  Well must run lil one is waking up from nap. I might be coming to town the first week of July depending on one thing, Eric. He is having an issue with me being gone for a few days with Austin. I'll keep begging him!

      Josh and I have problems.  Lots of problems.  Problems so HUGE that I ended up leaving him a couple of months ago.  Now we're back together, under the same roof trying to work out these problems.  I got back into town Wednesday afternoon after a five day trip.  I was greeted with a huff and we began arguing within 30-minutes.  By the time Friday rolled around, I was fed up.  I paid a visit to his mother.  Judy and I talked for over three hours.  We bonded.    I cried out of frustration, sadness and anger.  I vented about his car, our separate accounts, the fact that we're more like roommates (and Mary was a MUCH better roommate).  She got choked up at the thought of our marriage breaking up and wants, more than anything, to help me out.  Last night, for dinner, we invited Judy over.  At one point, Judy turned to Josh and asked,  "So, when are you going to get rid of the Porsche?"   I grabbed my pom-poms and began yelling at the top of my lungs,  "Gimme a 'J'!  Gimme a 'U'!  Gimme a 'D'!  Gimme a 'Y'!  What does that spell?  JUDY!"

      After 2 years of chasing Verizon, Robby FINALLY got an interview scheduled. It is on Tuesday at 11am. YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH. I had almost given up hope (yes, I know I have a lot of hope to hang on for 2 years). Now, you might ask, why in God's name would you wait for two years on a company? 1. Remember the COSTCO Man (I know there is a way to put the link to that Blog here, however, I do not have the patience nor the time right now to figure it out). 2. They have LOTS of great benefits that we do not currently have. 3. Opportunity for advancement-which neither of us has right now. 4. Will work close to home. 5. They will pay enough for him to work one job, but still give some overtime for extra money at times. 6. We know people that are helping him get in (no jokes here, like, if we know them so well, why is it taking 2 years??) 7. Anyway, yeahhhhhhhh!  Let's all pray for Robby to be his charming self and win over the hiring manager.  FYI, my dad is home from the hospital, but still with the same symptoms. They still don't know what's wrong, except it is supposedly not his heart.

      Angela recently left a comment on Isabel's site.  Normally, this would not be important, but when a comment is posted and you post using your name, a link to your profile will be added.  In your profile, a link to THIS site is then provided.  This is very dangerous, since my husband reads Isabel's site daily, and I desparately want to keep Girls Rule private, you know, our own little sanctuary.  Hence the reason "Boys Drool".    So, pleasePleasePLEASE, if you happen to post a comment on Isabel's site, do it anonymously and sign with your name, so I know who posted.  Sorry, Angela, I had to hide your comment and not allow any new ones for that post.  Oh wait, I'll just delete the post and write it again.  If you want to leave the comment again, don't forget to click on Anonymous!

      Okay so I have posted at least one maybe two posts before but only because I lucked into finding the post section. So normally I just post comments since that is all I could figure out. But I think I finally got it so here I am. Of course not much to say except I am so glad everyone is finally writing. Sometimes I feel so left out since I am in Florida. I must say I have alot of frinds here but they are not my old sorority sisters and must of them never even went to college so whem I talk about those fun times which I frequently miss they think I am psycho woman. Of course must of them think I am crazy for wanting to go back to work. Yes I am ready to go back. Could be because Austin is teething and driving my crazy. Or it could be my hormones kicking in.   Austin is registered to start Pre-K2 in January at 19 months. He took some sort of test and apparently is really smart and ready to start. Not really sure were he got that from was not his dad that is for sure. Anyways it is MWF 9-12 so I am really looking forward to a break.  After the second baby (if it is a girl I need help with baby names) comes in Feb I am going to start getting ready to teach. Yes I said teach which is way out of my field but after talking to Caroline, I decided that is what I want to do. I am tired of the medical field.&nbsp;   Florida is awesome but I really miss all my friends back home. Eric loves it here since he grew up in Georgia so all his friends are somewhere near. If anyone ever needs a vacation please come and visit. We have a house 5.2 miles from the ocean and we have an in-ground pool for those days you don't want the sandy beach. It is beautiful here. Caroline comes to visit all the time and Kat did for several summers.   Anyways enough rambling. Glad to hear that everyone is doing great.   Heather congrats on the baby! Jaime congrats on the baby! Kathleen congrats on the marriage! Terri your Isabelle is beautiful!! Caroline congrats on the new JOB!!! Stephanie have fun in Mexico!! For everyone else that I left off Congrats on whatever is new in your life!!  Oh and the best news WE ARE FINALLY DEBT FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What a great feeling!!!!!!!!!!!!  &nbsp;

      When Josh got home from work on Friday, he was in a shitty mood.  And, unfortunately, when Josh is in a shitty mood, he has a way of trying to spread the shit to others around him.  Normally, this would've been a HUGE fight, but instead I ignored him and told him to go to dinner by himself because I didn't want to deal with a temper tantrum.  I've learned that these temper tantrums should be dealt with like a two-year old would be dealt with ... ignore him because all he wants is attention.  So I did just that.  But the tantrum continued into Saturday.  I won't go into detail, but the shit was getting stinkier and becoming unbearable.  So I packed up Isabel, called Angela and told her to meet us at my parent's house.  Plus, Isabel decided she wanted to join in the spreading of the shit and started throwing tantrums all afternoon.  And, since her grandparents and aunt love her more than I do, what better people to spread her shit on.  Sunday, came sweet justice.  When I left for a few hours, I got a phone call from Josh - he needed heavy-duty Drano and a heavy-duty plunger.  There was a clog somewhere in the pipes and the tub, washing machine and toilets were all backing up.  Yes, shit was literaly coming out of the toilets.   Lesson:   If you spread your shit on me, don't be surprised if I spread my shit on you.

      Man, it's only Monday and I have 8 more days until I will be on a plane to Mexico.&nbsp; You'd think I'd be really focused on getting my work done right now considering.... my boss has been out of town since last Tuesday (until this Thursday) and I'm handling the workload&nbsp;of two people, that my "To Do:" list keeps piling up (like a big bowl of salad that I can't make a dent in), and I'm rested from a somewhat relaxing weekend.&nbsp; But noooo, I keep looking at this site, at Isabel's site, the resort's (in Mexico) site, personal email...and the list goes on. I feel like a little kid who doesn't want to clean their room.&nbsp; When will this day be over...and the next... and the next...   The only interesting thing I can think to share with you today is this AWESOME fruit dip recipe -- I'm going to go ahead and claim this one as "My side dish to take over to people's houses whenever we plan something where I have to bring something that's good and easy to make" dish, but I'll go ahead and share so you guys can enjoy.&nbsp; It's addictive I tell you...   1 small jar of marshmallow cream  1 small package of cream cheese (room temperature)  1/2 teaspoon of vanilla   Mix ingredients together and ready to serve. (You can make ahead of time, just put in the fridge to keep cool.)&nbsp; Dip with grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, whatever you like. Enjoy!

      I've really tried to make an effort to post regularly, but like others, have failed.&nbsp; Things are SO hectic at work right now, in trying to prepare my caseload for someone else!&nbsp; I've been working overtime, and can't wait to come out on Friday and see everyone!&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll have plenty to celebrate, too, since it's my last day in Tarrant County!  Married life is great, Mike is great.&nbsp; We're doing typical married stuff, staying at home a lot, attending family functions, etc.&nbsp; Who knew that these things would be my favorite things to do!!&nbsp; You could have told me that a few years back, and I would have laughed out loud!&nbsp; Mike starts nursing school in August (again), so we're trying to relax some before that.  My brother is currently in the hospital, recovering from his high does chemo.&nbsp; Doctor's hope he will be in some sort of remission afterwards, so keep us in your thoughts.&nbsp;   In addition to all this, I'm trying to stay calm during this election year.&nbsp; I get so carried away with all these political talks and debates!&nbsp; Probably because a lot of these issues affect my job, and clients, that I have such strong opinions! I'll do everything I can to stop from berating you with my opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, if anyone wants to talk politics, or has questions, I'm game.&nbsp; (Like I'm going to get overwhelmed with that request, right.)&nbsp;   Talk to you guys later!!  &nbsp;

      Thanks for the nudge Terri!!&nbsp; I always tell myself that I will post something tomorrow night.... or the next.... and never get around to doing it.&nbsp;   I've been at my new job for almost two month's now.&nbsp; I'm finally on a big project and I've been staying really busy.&nbsp;&nbsp;My project entails&nbsp;creating new statements for MBNA credit cards in Europe and Ireland.&nbsp; My first few weeks at MBNA were AWFUL!!&nbsp; I was bored silly since I don't have internet access at work.&nbsp; Can you imagine??????&nbsp; It sucks!!!&nbsp; I'm actually getting used to it now.&nbsp; MBNA is so paranoid about hackers that hardly anyone has access.&nbsp; Especially contractors like me.   My concrete floors are still there.&nbsp; I vacuumed them the other day (pathetic huh?).&nbsp; The house is coming along though.&nbsp; I'm getting really excited.&nbsp; I've got pictures that I will post on a website.&nbsp; Once I get that done I will let ya'll know where they are.&nbsp; It's truly amazing the change that we have made in our home.&nbsp; This house that I couldn't stand is starting to become exactly what I wanted.   No baby yet.....&nbsp; Need to cover the concrete floors first..... :o)&nbsp;   We get our DSL line on the 27th, so I'll be on the computer all the time then.&nbsp; Promise to write more soon......

           Hey guys!!&nbsp;   I just want to tell you guys that I am sorry that I havent written sooner!!&nbsp; However I really do enjoy coming on&nbsp;here (if only for a few minutes) to find out what everyone is up to.&nbsp; It is great for me since I dont get to see anyone very often!  So what is up with me?&nbsp; Well Hayden is&nbsp;growing like a weed!!&nbsp; He is crawling like a mad man and pulling up on anything he can get his hands on.&nbsp; We had his 9 month&nbsp;check up&nbsp;yesterday and he is doing great (of course the doctor said that BEFORE Hayden pee'd all over her, she wasnt singing his praises after that).  Also I dont know if you guys know or not but Matt and I have sold our house and are moving back to Arlington.&nbsp; We have not been happy with our neighborhood (houses everywhere are going for lease or rent)&nbsp;and our home value has not increased in 3 years.&nbsp; So we sold it last week and have made an offer on a house off of Lamar and Davis behind Shackelford Junior High.&nbsp; We are closing on August 16th so everyone say a prayer for us that we make it though this move.&nbsp; I hate moving!!!&nbsp; I am excited about being in&nbsp;a new house but I dread the move.&nbsp; Especially with a kiddo.  So that is all with me.&nbsp; Talk to you guys soon!  Heather

       I had a training today with our Sampling department (these are the people that keep track of  ALL  the people (panel members) who have signed up on our website to take surveys and tell you who might or might not qualify to take your survey. By  ALL  I mean everybody in the world. Pretty cool huh?!) Anyway the manager of the department was showing a really cool site on our intranet, that our client service peeps use to see how many panel members, if any, would possibly qualify for a particular survey. It had a list of choices that you could use to break down what you wanted to look for. If you wanted to see how many:   Married females;  Ages 21-35;  With the income of $50-$75,000;  Lived in California, it would give you the number of those that might qualify.   Well, we decided to see how many single guys there were for me. Do you smell the desperation yet??? Since I have always wanted to go to Ireland  and  figured the only way I was going to get there was to marry....okay date....someone who previously lived there and still had family there for us to visit on occasion, I felt this was a perfect way to see where my prospects lay  ( INSERT SOUND OF ME PURRING HERE ).  So this is what we put in:   Male;  Single;  27-35 (I know, but I like young);  Employed full-time;  Lives in a Single Family Home;  Owns a Single Family Home;  College graduate.   I am very disappointed to say that I will never go to Ireland to live or otherwise visit because the results of my search turned out only   4 men  . Lucky for me I don't know how to spell de-feet (see don't know how), so I refined my search to those men in Texas. I also included an income criteria of $60-$100,000. Alas, that resulted in only   24 prospects  .   The good news is, those people don't represent the population as a whole, just the population for this company.   SO HOPE STILL PREVAILS!!!!!!

      I know, I am not a good blogger! I actually have rarely been doing any personal e-mailing at work. Part of that could be due to the fact that Caroline isn't at a computer all day.&nbsp;Every now and again I remember that the blog is out there and read some of it, but then I click out and never get back to it. Since Terri sent&nbsp;out a&nbsp;desperate attempt today to get messages, I will begin.  For now I have put the job search on hold - and at such an odd time because I was FINALLY getting interviews. My company offered me the chance to work on another account - Fisher Price or&nbsp;I could have gotten&nbsp;promoted on my current account -&nbsp;Honda. Since I don't enjoy my Honda work and knew that wouldn't&nbsp;change&nbsp; I decided to go to F.P.&nbsp; That account is all on-line work which will double my skill set. On Honda I did all Database Marketing and Direct Mail, now I will be doing stuff with&nbsp;FP's website including Media, Sweepstakes, Banner Ads, etc.&nbsp; I had just completed my 3rd interview with Blockbuster Corp. and it was looking good, but it was going to be a lateral move and not much more money.&nbsp; So I decided to give my company one more shot to make me happy and&nbsp; to gain a lot of experience in the process so that if I job search again I can get a better job. Of coarse then Michael's called me&nbsp;on Monday for an interview. You know, isn't that just how its goes. Oh well, for now I'm sticking to my decision. And I decided since I'm staying at TB, I have to completely change my attitude about the company give them a clean slate. We'll see how long that lasts. :-)   Can't seem to find the cute boys in Valley Ranch. Married, gay, etc......you know the drill. Not at all like they portray the single life on Sex and the City. Maybe there are men right and left in New York???&nbsp;   Terri - how was Isabel's birthday party on Saturday? Sorry I couldn't go, I already had my flight&nbsp;booked to visit Cenia in Midland. I go there when I want to get away and do a lot of nothing - which I might add is exactly what we did. We did paint her dog's little house though!

      I got to work yesterday to find my office decorated in streamers, balloons and candy.  Have I ever mentioned how much I adore my sister?  There were post-it notes galore - on my wall, on my monitor, even on the back of my door.  HR would probably throw a fit if they knew how many post-it notes were wasted!  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     urlLink    Angela got me plants for my office too!  She named them Moe and Jennifer (for the "blonde" one).  urlLink     These pictures are made possible by  urlLink this .  My sweet husband actually listened when I told him what I wanted for my birthday.  I have a lot of improvement to do in the photography area, so these are just practice pics until I learn how to use this thing!

      Today, I turn 27.  I cried last night, and the night before that, and the night before that, at the thought of turning 27.  Not because I’m suddenly "old" or that much closer to 30, but because I look around me and see all the blessings that I have and I know that 27 is going to be a great year.  When I turned 25, I saw myself as a successful career woman who wanted to continue my education and not miss out on a single party invitation that came my way.  I looked at my friends and thanked God that I didn’t have a child to tie me down or a mortgage or bills, DEAR GOD, THE BILLS.  Then I ended up getting  urlLink married, drunk and pregnant , all in one night ... and my life was forever changed.  25 would never look the same again.  And I was only 3 months into it!  I had to say good-bye to that previous life.  I had to say good-bye to continuing my education and the parties.  And hello to big panties (who am I kidding, I still wore a thong every day I was pregnant) and swollen ankles.  I had to save money and eat healthy and STOP DRINKING.  No more long evenings at Friday’s with Mary or late nights partying in Deep Ellum.  I mourned for months, because, in essence, I had to come to grips with the death of my youth.  Then came 26.   26 was an even more difficult year.  Harder than I thought survivable.  I remember my 26th birthday vividly – 7 days overdue and praying incessantly that my pregnancy was all a joke that someone forgot to let me in on.  I was at my parent’s house, blowing out candles with my fake, sorority girl smile.  After all, I was glowing (sweating) and had a baby on the way.  A BABY!  A BABY WOULD BE HERE VERY SOON!  PROOF THAT THE WORLD SHOULD GO ON!  And I’d never been more scared, angry, confused and depressed in all my life.  Having a child while fighting for a marriage is not at all how I envisioned my life would be.  I never knew how demanding being a wife AND a mother would be.  So, I spent a good part of my 26th year bitter.  Bitter at my husband, bitter at my child and bitter at God.  But then something clicked, almost over night.  I suddenly realized that, hey, I have a  urlLink BEAUTIFUL little girl , a  urlLink marriage worth fighting for  and a God who’s on my side, even if I sometimes think He’s full of crap.  I know 27 is not going to be a bed of roses.  But I’ve learned much more over the past year than many learn in a lifetime.  And, secretly, I’m sorta glad for all the pain.  Because, without it, I would’ve missed out on so many of life’s lessons.  So now I’m crying again ... and I’ve never been happier.

      I don't know if any of you are as crazy about magazines as I am, but I have found some awesome deals. I have about 5 subscriptions as it is and now will be getting more!  Ebay has several vendors selling magazine subscriptions for dirt cheap!  One example I saw recently was 3 yrs of Shape magazine for $3.44! And no shipping/handling. I also saw Us weekly for $18, normally about $52.  Vanity Fair was about $9.00 and several others. You can also renew subscriptions this way.   Why hadn't I found this sooner?!

      Spencer and I went down to Lampasas this weekend to visit Chase and his girlfriend before football sucks up all of Chase's time until November. It was a relaxing getaway...BUT--while the bug problem has improved at my apartment, I think the little shits at my apartment called ahead to their hillbilly friends to let them know I was on my way.   Yesterday, after breakfast I heard Ashley screaming and Chase and Spencer running around. Turns out a HUGE roach (I swear, like 2 inches long) had snuck in to Chase's room and was roaming around. They finally caught the disgusting creature and threw him in the toilet to flush him down.   Well, it was finally my turn to hop in the shower to get ready for the day. Before getting in the water, I went to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet. Any ways, I stood up and turned around and flush the commode and there was this HUGE, brown creature flailing around like crazy in the swirling water and I'm like, "What the #$@%@^! Where in the @#!@$! did that come from?!?" I started wondering if that disgusting thing touched my bottom, wait a sec... he saw my bottom! Dirty, perverted bug. I screamed for Spencer and he came in--I asked him what they did with the roach they found and he told me they flushed it down the toilet...  However--turns out Mr. Roach was smarter than they thought. He used the toilet paper floating in the bowl, the same paper that they caught him with--to hoist himself up the inside of the toilet and climb into the crack (where the water comes out). They tried getting him out, but were unsuccessful so they gave up. ***Spencer and Chase forgot to mention this part of the story, which would have been nice to know so I could have been a little more prepared for this first thing in the morning.***  Needless to say, I was in the shower for about 30 minutes with a majority of the time spent scrubbing the first two layers of skin off my bum to make sure I had no bug cooties on me.

      Do you know how irritating it is to know that you're scamming on somebody, only to have them throw it back in your face?  And while they're throwing it at you, they may as well have told you, "Ha-ha, take that, because you're not as smooth as you think you are!"  Well, lady I am smooth and you can kiss my ass, because, in reality, I wasn't really scamming you.  You're just a bitter hag who's pissed because you're stuck in a poor selling store that should've been shut down a long time ago.  So, I'm now in protest of the  urlLink The Limited  at  urlLink North Hills Mall .  I'm protesting the manager who said that the pants I wanted to return didn't belong to the tag I had.  I'm protesting her bad attitude that she has every time I walk into that store and SPEND $300, which happens ATLEAST twice a month.  So tomorrow, Angela and I are going to the competition to return the pants, even though it's not really the competition, it's just a different store in the same chain that the bitch from today will never be good enough for.  Gawd, could I sound like any more of a drama queen?  *Update (07/11/04) In an effort to "stick it to the man" yesterday, Angela and I actually went to Office Max, Wal-mart AND Office Depot to purchase  urlLink this .  Little did we know that it would cost me FORTY DOLLARS!  Feeling deflated (and like God was against us), we went home.  Then Angela came up with a brilliant plan - go to The Limited, purchase a cheap shirt and use the plastic tag doo-hickey thing from the shirt.  But God was back on our side, and I found a shirt with two, TWO, plastic tag doo-hickey things.  So I pulled it off and used it for my pants.  I'm sure this makes no sense to you, readers, but it worked!  I was able to return the pants at  urlLink Hulen Mall  FOR FULL PRICE!  Take that, North Hills Bitch.

      My husband has just applied for a full-time job as a "Costco" man.  He will be quiting his daytime job and relinquishing all ties to his true love, pulling cable.  Unfortunately, his love for ME and our little girl (and because I said so)are tearing him away. I NEED HIM/HELP.   I don't want to be a single mother anymore-I need his help (contrary to what he believes, his help will not include lying around in the recliner watching ESPN)and Kylie needs to see her daddy more often and have her poopy diaper changed by him on a more regular basis.  I found cobwebs on the majority of the windows in our home-the biggest ones were in Kylie's room.  I am not having enough time to clean our home!!  We only get the floor vacuumed about twice a month.  My daughter will be crawling soon!  Imagine what she will pick up and eat!!  The lawn needs to be mowed more often then once a month; I want someone else to fix the toilet; I want my dad to quit having to offer to trim our bushes or inform me I need new tires.  I am sick of his stupid day job not paying him mileage or gas when he trapses all over the metroplex...when they make him go all the way to the office in Lewisville and then say, oh, we need you in Mansfield, then don't send him with enough supplies and make him drive all the way back or just send him home for the day because they don't even have enough ordered (poor management!!).    I am sick of them making him buy his own tools...I am especially sick of the tool that cost $150 last week that he will probably only need to use a couple of times.    I am sick of the job they sent him to several months ago where one of THEIR tools fell out of the back of his truck and we had to pay almost $300 to replace it but when 2 months ago the drill I bought him for Christmas (all $300 of it) got stolen from a job site, they did not pay us back!   So I say again, I am the proud owner of a "COSTCO" man. Hopefully this will be temporary, hopefully he can someday get a job he actually likes, hopefully someday I can sit my fatass on the couch and eat bon-bons with Kylie and watch soaps all day while my rich corporate husband rakes in the dough....for now though, I will be content just to have my husband home with Kylie and I for at least 50% of the time so we can enjoy groceries bought with coupons, sit on our discount furniture and watch Kylie play with her garage sale toys!

      My niece, Riley, has been in town all week, so I've been spending every second of my free time hanging out with her. She turned two in March and she is just so much fun--I can't believe how much I love her! If this is what "mommy-hood" is like, I think I'm getting a taste of it.   Any ways, enough of my babbling, here's my Top 10 List of My Favorite Things to do With Riley.   1. Watching Riley (thinking she's being sneaky) take a bite out of every chocolate chip cookie my mom made for everyone. 2. Listening to Riley read (actually make up stories about the pictures in the book). 3. Twirling like a princess. 4. Playing follow the leader. 5. Painting our toenails. 6. Jumping into the pool and swimming like Nemo. 7. Talking in cat language and making fun of my cat, Mo (aka Grumpy Kitty). 8. Sharing mac&cheese out of the same bowl sitting on the floor. 9. Doing the Pee-Pee Dance when she uses her little poddy. 10. Singing songs like Twinkle, Twinkle..and singing the Pee-Pee Dance song. (Yes, there's a song that goes with the dance--and if you're lucky, maybe I'll teach you when we're out drinking sometime.)  Have a great weekend!!

      Time has flown this past year!  My one year anniversary is fast approaching and falls on my first day of school!!!!  That should be eventful.  While we are planning a dinner for that evening (and drinks as I am sure I will need them!), I wanted a getaway before then!!!  I have thought of a few different destinations, Vegas being one, but also Fredericksburg, TX. We have NEVER been but have heard a lot about it. Can anyone recommend a great place to stay? A B&B?  There are too many to choose from!   Thanks for your help! :)

      Well, I'm happy to announce that I have been offered another position within C.P.S.  I applied for a new job mid-June, and interviewed last week.  They contacted me yesterday, and I am so excited!!  It will be a big change, lots less stress.  The position will be housed out of Dallas, which is different, and far away from our apartment.  However, we've always intended to move further north eventually, like Grapevine or HEB, so this may just speed it up.  I'm sad about leaving my great boss, and the kids on my caseload, but I'm in definite need of less crisis oriented days.  Anyways, just wanted you guys to know!!  Talk to ya soon!

      Terri, I feel your pain. Those little boogers have been tormenting me for several weeks now. It's been a combination of the rain, the overgrown wilderness behind my apartment and the fact that the little creatures (who am I kidding--these things are huge) can smell fear. They're even more pissed off because I hired a professional to come in and drop an H-bomb to annihilate any and all--four or more legged--intruders.   ...Spiders in my shower and on my clothes, bees and gnats coming through the window, some other crawly-thingys on the floor... they've got me surrounded I tell you! Little bastards.

      I've  urlLink mentioned before  how much I LOVE being in a house versus an apartment.  The extra space, the friendly neighbors, the yard.  But I never anticipated that the house would be crawling with critters who's main goal is to scare the shit out of me on a daily basis.  I laughed out loud at  urlLink Alice's   urlLink dilemma  and it seems that the little effers heard my laughter and have decided to attack.  And I think they've decided to call in the reinforcements from across the entire neighborhood.  When Josh and I first moved in, we (and when I say we, I really mean Josh, because, c'mon, I'm not getting anywhere near them) have only had to kill about 1-2 a week.  Being in an apartment for so long, this was 1000% more than I ever had to kill before I moved in here.  My logic told me that since the house had been vacant for so long, this was all completely normal.  However, I've become so skittish of putting on shoes that I can't see inside of, that I decided something needed to be done.   urlLink Angela  told me about  urlLink this  spray, so we (and when I say we, I once again mean Josh) went after the little bastards with a vengeance today.  And they decided to fight back.  Within minutes, they came out in full armor, carrying oozies.  One even looked at me and said, "Hey bitch, you won't get rid of us that easily."  Of course, I screamed and cowered like a little girl.  Josh told me to kill it with my shoe (yeah, like that's gonna happen) and I ran down the street.  Total, within 45-minutes of spraying, we (and when I say we ... okay, you should get this by now) killed five, FIVE, of the monsters.  And I know they're underneath the house planning their next attack on me.  I have a feeling it will happen tomorrow morning, sometime after Josh leaves for work and when I'm home alone.

      Most of us have seen  urlLink the show , or atleast heard of it.  Here's the lowdown on a few stats of  urlLink the area :  Popular slang (atleast it's what I heard most) - "You got it." Average High - 74 degrees Airport -  urlLink John Wayne Airport  Major Attraction -  urlLink Disneyland  [My] Favorite Attraction - The Boys  Let me tell you a little bit about The Boys of The OC. One word: yummy. Another word: delicious.  This week, I interviewed 34 people who currently live in The OC.  Of these 34, fifteen were male.  Of these fifteen, eight were hotHotHOT.  I mean seriously hot.  When I wasn't interviewing or sleeping, I was eating at a local restaurant.  Again, hotHotHOT.  And I even thought I saw  urlLink Jim  in the area.  Then again, many of The Boys are fit and bald, so I found myself sadly mistaken.  You know, I recently bitched about Pete checking out all the skirts.  I guess I had a hard time keeping my eyes in my head too!  Oh, SoCal, how I miss thee!

      I’m in Orange County, CA with a client of mine, Pete.  After some seriously boring work yesterday, we decided to have dinner and a few beers.  Pete is a nice enough guy, but trying to keep his attention was hopeless.  Every time a chick in a short skirt walked by, I lost him.    You know, I have a pretty nice ass ... why wasn't he checking mine out?!

      Alright, I'm here at work, no appointments for the day.  I had intended to get caught up with my e-mailing big time, as well as work some.  However, our SERVER IS DOWN for e-mail.  I cannot believe this happens?  What am I to do?  Work throughout the entire day?  Let's get real.  I feel like I'm in a crisis here.  Today's like my Friday, as I'm off tomorrow and Monday to go out of town, so I'm really not up for a lot of working.  This stinks.  So-to emulate Terri's Addiction Post, here are things I do at work when I cannot e-mail:  1.  Post pointless blogs that will probably end up annoying my friends. 2.  Ponder who invented the idea of blogs. 3.  Make lists of things I would want to buy if I had won the big lotto. 4.  Make plans for a long lunch. 5.  Call Mike at work, and annoy him. 6.  Call Mike at work, apologize for the earlier call. 7.  Make a list of things I would want to buy if I wasn't broke. 8.  Balance my checkbook. 9.  Wonder who's getting married next out of my friends. 10.  Get annoyed with Shaner's posting titled Engagement, as I got excited, and then really let down. 11.  Wonder what the hell Britney is doing w/that loser.  Well-that's all for now.  I doubt this will be my last post of the day....

      Well most of you have heard Florida got hit be Charley on Friday. All I have to say is I prefer tornado alley to hurricane row. Luckily since it hit south of Tampa we missed out on the bad winds they hit south of us in Daytona. But I spent the last part of the week preparing for the worst since the crazy people that live here like to scare you to deaf if you have never been through a hurricane before. First I was told to buy those special hurricane boards. Right at over $2000 for all the windows in my house. No way! So then I decided well I'll just take my chances without them and buy the water, batteries, and canned goods to last us if the power and water go out. Well no one told me it would be mass mania at the stores. I got the last pack of D batteries and literally had to run for the last thing of bread. It was crazy. Then I was leaving to go home when the parking lot was packed with a line. For what?? It was for gas as if I would be driving somewhere in the storm. 2 hours long to get gas. I of course was not crazy enough to wait. So we are then told all the bridges are closing by 6pm so no one can go out or come into the area. Fine with me since we were staying home.  All of this crazy worrying and running around for just a few hours of a normal ran shower. THAT WAS IT!!!! I was hoping with all the preparations I made at least we would have lose of power so I could use the candles (how romantic).  That is why I say tornado alley os much better it comes in you have maybe a 5 minute warning then it goes away no preparing or worrying for days.  Oh and yes there was a tornado that hit north of town. Just were they needed to do some reconstruction of the older buildings. As the weather man said it was a supercell usually seen in Texas and Oklahoma. At least I felt at home for a minute.

      The Boy went out of town this weekend.  This didn't change my weekend activities by much, since they're usually spent with Isabel and Angela anyways.  Only this weekend, I had help with the dishes and got to watch  urlLink this  until midnight.  And my sweet sister even made breakfast for me this morning.  After church today, I decided to check in with the Boy and tell him that Angela, Isabel and I were going to Dallas for the afternoon.  This was the conversation:   Boy:   Would you try to come home early?  Me:   Why?  Boy:   I'd like to spend some time with my girls.  Me:   Aahh ...  I came home to a sleeping husband.  And immediately had to get dinner ready for a SCREAMING one-year old.  When he finally decided that he'd had enough time to wake up (and I've ripped all my hair out trying to entertain my SCREAMING monster and make her dinner at the same time), we had this conversation:   Boy:   What time is it?  Me (jokingly) :  Why, is there a race on TV?  Boy:   Maybe.  So, why did I come home?  To spend time together, right?  Because spending time together involves watching yet ANOTHER FUCKING RACE on Speedvision.  I'm thinking about cancelling the cable ... or atleast hiding the remote control.  (I should mention that he atleast put Isabel to bed for me ... after I changed her poopy diaper.)

      Sometimes boys don't think when they open their mouths.  More often than not, they try to speak and shit just pours out.  And wouldn't the world just be a better place if all boys did were kill bugs, take out the trash and, occasionally, fall on top of us?  Many months ago, Isabel's pediatrician made mention that I'm Isabel's "Alpha female," i.e., I'm her number one woman.  Last night, the Boy made a similar comment, except he said he was her "Alpha dog".  I asked, "Does this make me her Alpha bitch?"  He said, "No, you're her Beta dog."   Beta dog?  You mean second in command?  I beg to differ, my friend!     I wake Isabel up five to six mornings a week and take her to the appropriate caretaker during the week.  I pick her up four out of five afternoons.  I take her shopping (Wal-mart, Target, the mall, etc.) with me on the weekends.  I take her for walks in the evenings.  I know her pediatrician and his ENTIRE staff.  I'm the one who researched daycares and gave each teacher the third degree before dropping her off on her first day.  I buy her clothes and her food.  Hell, I buy her diapers and her wipes and changing cloths for public restrooms.  Does the Boy even know what a changing cloth is?  Nope!  After his comment, I got very quiet, not wanting to argue.  Within moments, Isabel crawled over to me, handed me her blanket and laid her head on my tummy.  She got up and gave me a hug and a very wet kiss on the mouth.  She even patted my head and crawled on top of me and put her head on my shoulder.  After MANY minutes of cuddling and playing, she crawled over to the Boy and HIT him in the head.  Then she proceeded to sit on his pillow and fart on it,  urlLink FOUR TIMES .  Take that, Alpha Dog.

      So, I'm out here in Dallas now.  Things are very different.  To begin with, I'm in a cube now.  What, you ask, a cube?  I was quite bitter about it for at least 48 hours.  I mean, I'm not a new employee.  Then, the cube I was assigned ticked off a few people, as they had been using it.  I swear, controversy follows me wherever I go.  Otherwise, things are great in the new job.  I feel like a different person, not so emotionally drained on a daily basis.   I'd also like to take this opportunity to gripe a bit, about a sensitive topic, so be forewarned, I'm not trying to tick anyone off.  Just being my honest self, which at times, you like about me.  Religion.  I grew up a Southern Baptist, through and through.  Went to church camp, on mission trips, and can still name every book in the Bible in order, both testaments.  Upon attending college, I began to realize that not everyone grew up believing what I did, and what my small town did.  There was a whole world out there, who had different beliefs than me, and believed them with the same faith and sincerity that I did.  What made them wrong?  So now, I am more opened minded when it comes to spirituality.  I'm not an atheist.  I do believe in God.  But, I don't believe that I have to think a specific way to please Him/Her, and that I'll burn if I don't say a certain prayer.  I mean, I believe that God presents Himself/Herself in different ways to different peoples.  Allah and God may be the same, who knows?  Not me.  Anyways, I don't live a life that is dictated by religious teachings, but I can understand that others do.  What gets to me, is that when people try to present themselves as religious, but have actions have a person with no spirituality.  I mean, going to church twice a week doesn't really appear to make a difference on someone, if they are "lying, stealing and cheating," as the saying goes.  I see this all the time, at work, with friends, etc.  When I believed in a religion, I adhered for the most part.  Felt bad when I sinned, didn't thrive on it.  I don't get.  Anyways, those are my current thoughts and questions.  Any answers would be helpful.

      Is patience really a virtue...what does that mean exactly...I am patiently waiting to hear whether I get this job or not and in the meantime I am trying to be patient....it is coming up on two weeks since I had my interview and I realize the person hiring was out of town BUT patience do wear thin!!  I am begining to hate that word!!  Why cant they say "Kathryn, we really like you and would like for you come on board permanently" which would be ideal or "Kathryn, you are a great worker but we have decided to go in a different direction" which would not be ideal...in the interum I must be patient....I really hate that word!!

      My husband prides himself on never getting sick (or so he says).  He claims that it's due to  urlLink Echinacea .  And I've told him over and over that I think it's a bunch of crap.  I think if you're gonna get sick, you're gonna get sick.  Echinacea or not.  But, then again, my husband takes Echinacea religiously and NEVER gets sick.  So he must be right.  Or not.   urlLink Isabel  enjoyed two days of daycare last week.  She brought home new skills (oh God, the  urlLink standing !).  She also brought home a cold.  And she rubbed that cold all over her father and me.  Yesterday, Josh woke up feeling pretty lousy.  He ended up spending much of the day in bed and I spent much of the day entertaining a one-year old who was feeling much better.  Today, Josh is, again, at home in bed.  And I'm at work (with the sniffles, but still at work).  And the funny thing is that I've never taken Echinacea and Josh has been popping them all weekend.  I love being right.

      Lately, my alarm clock seems to be malfunctioning.....usually  she  goes off at 6:15am every morning making happy ahhhhhhhh sounds until about 6:50am when I shut  her  off by putting a bottle in her mouth. But for the last few days, she has been going off at 5:15 and 5:30 am and I can't get the snooze button to work!  I walk into her room at the crack of dawn, and can see her head with her big, wide eyes staring at me over the top of the crib---and then she gets a big grin on her face when she sees me and then drops down, rolls over and waits for me to peak over the edge to see her.  Such a cutie-even when she wakes me up and it's not even light outside!  Other big news----(since that previous blurb was so important for you all to know.....)  I made Robby put in a 2 week notice with his day job on Friday. He kept telling me he did not need to give them that much notice, they don't care about him or any other employee and that they would just replace him. I said, no, you don't need to be burning bridges, 2 weeks is good business practice. So he did what I said like a good husband---and his DataTex manager responded with, "Go ahead and go...employees are never any good once they put in their notice". Robby responded with, "But I have a family to support, a baby...". His manager shrugged his shoulders and asked for Robby's work cell phone back. Asshole. I know it's his right as an employer to let someone go at anytime after a notice for voluntary quit has been put in, but that is ridiculous. Robby worked his ass off for those people, plus they never gave him any benefits, and they were insanely underpaying him! So now, Robby is out of work for 2 weeks! Assholes. And it's pretty much my fault. At least Robby isn't saying "I told you so." Of course he shouldn't, b/c I let him go to Clifton's bachelor party today.

      We had a HUGE fight Tuesday night.  This one sent me to bed crying for hours, not to mention my pure and utter guilt for sending my sweet, adorable, innocent little girl to daycare that day.  Oh, dear God, the humanity.  How could I send my child to DAYCARE, and  urlLink PRIMROSE  of all places?!  I should be shot and sent straight to Hell.  Back to the fight - I was already beating myself up all day over the torture that my poor child endured, than I came home and had a fight with the Boy.  I cried, and cried, and cried.  I woke up with puffy eyes and a shitty attitude yesterday.  Don't worry, this time I didn't call my lawyer, I thought we would resolve it last evening.  We didn't.  And the fighting continued.  So today, after a pep talk with one of my coworkers, I decided to try to come up with a solution that would make us both happy.  So in an effort to make going home tonight a bit easier, I sent the Boy this:   urlLink     And he sent me this:   urlLink     And we continued with the same signs but the following words:   Me:   Sex is not always the first answer. -God  Boy:   Let your husband know that he's appreciated. -God  Me:   Listen to the whole story before jumping to conclusions. -God  Boy:   We could do this all day. -God  Me:   Writing can be very therapeutic. -God  Boy:   Ringing your wife's neck can be very therapeutic as well. -God  Me:   Wives don't scare that easily. -God  Boy:   Wives, submit to your husbands as I have commanded. -God  Me:   Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church. -God  He ended this banter by simply replying (no church sign):  I knew you were going to say that.  You know the great thing about these signs?  You're limited on how much you can write, so you really have to think about your argument.  I'm not sure how tonight will go, but I wish I could take the signs home with me.

      Yesterday, CostCo man met with two beings from Planet Verizon.  After speaking in a foreign tongue only they could understand, the Verizians sent the CostCo man on his way with silent hope in his heart.  The CostCo man, sure he would not speak again to the Verizians for many a fortnight as they are very slow in their ways, went back to his drudging work.    A few hours later, a ringing noise filled his ear and when he pushed the magic button, the joyous voice of a Verizian filled his ears.  They had but one thing to say:  YOU'RE HIRED AND YOU START AUGUST 23!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   (The simple version for those of you who have not caught on yet and/or don't have the same brain malfunction I have, Robby had an interview with Verizon on Tuesday and got hired.)

      Many of you know I bought a new car last Tuesday.  I sent the following letter to the owner, Sam Pack, the general manager, the sales managers and floor managers of Five Star Ford.  I also sent it to the general manager and sales manager of Don Davis Ford.  *********************** To Whom It May Concern:  My husband and I had the displeasure of working with Mike Huntzinger and Dan Balich at Five Star Ford in North Richland Hills in buying a 2004 Explorer Sport Trac on Monday, July 26th.  After an initial test drive, we decided to discuss the purchase of the vehicle and the value of our trade-in with Dan.  Unfortunately, our 1999 Honda Prelude was appraised at $6000, a huge disappointment since my husband and I were fully aware that our vehicle was worth much more.  Feeling that our intelligence had been severely insulted, we decided to go home and return after doing a bit more research.  Dan, not wanting to lose a sale, said he would discuss the value with his manager.  He came back and offered $9000 – a 50% markup!  Feeling even more insulted, we once again insisted that we would sleep on it and return the next evening.    Again, Dan asked us to wait a moment while he retrieved his manager, Mike, from the back so that Mike could “come over and say ‘Hello.’”  Well, Mike’s ‘Hello’ turned into a battle to leave.  With a cranky and tired one-year old on my hip, I explained to Mike that we wanted to do more research and assured him that we would return the next evening to discuss the sale.  His attitude immediately changed, asking what more we needed to know, what our current payments are (as if the our Honda and the Sport Trac are comparable) and then he finally huffed off assuming they had just lost a sale.  My husband, trying to assure Mike and Dan that we would return, asked about taking the vehicle home for the evening ensuring that we would be back the next day – Mike’s words, “That ain’t gonna happen.”  In an effort to redeem his sale, Dan asked that we not hold Mike against him, because “it’s his job to act like that.”  The following evening, my husband and I bought a 2004 Explorer Sport Trac from Patrick Jackson at Don Davis Ford in Arlington.  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with a smile.  We were given room to breathe and inspect the vehicle and felt no pressure to immediately discuss numbers.  Our vehicle appraised at a much higher number and we were told many times how nicely we maintain both of our vehicles (my husband and I were in separate vehicles).  Patrick worked with us on dropping the price of the Sport Trac since it included options we hadn’t originally anticipated.  We also discussed, in detail, the advantages and disadvantages of financing through Ford Motor Credit since we’d already been pre-qualified through our credit union.  After shaking hands with Patrick, we discussed financing with David Barragan.  David gave us the information we needed to make an informed decision about our options and we left feeling very good about our buy.  I want to thank Don Davis Ford, as well as Patrick Jackson and David Barragan, for a wonderful experience.  And I want to thank Five Star Ford, especially Mike Huntzinger, for leaving us no choice but to continue our search elsewhere.  Regards, TMR *******************  I'm not sure what the outcome will be, or if anything at all will happen, but I received a note back from Sam Pack himself saying he would investigate the situation.  Better than nothing!

      My summer break has come to an end, laying in the pool for hours during the day, sleeping in late, staying out late, and just the fun of making Terri jealous. As of Monday I am back to school. I'm excited but also very nervous to be starting at a new school again. I just keep thinking about my first year teaching in the public school system and how unbearable it was but I was also having to tie shoes, wipe noses, and dealing with children who still had accidents. I don't think my 4th graders will be like that but you never know.  I'm going into a school that only has one returning teacher in the 4th grade which makes me wonder, why? Many things keep going through my head about that and last night I had a nightmare about it. This room filled with children that just wouldn't listen or do anything they were told to. I woke up scared to death that my class would be like that. A bunch of wild children running all over me and then I thought I'm sure to have a few that won't be wild. I'm sure I'll still be crying the first day of school when I get home and probably the night before worrying about what type of children I will have in my classroom. Sorry Caroline I'm not trying to scare you.  So with all that said I'm going to go enjoy my last day of laying in the pool for the summer. Just think though in 3 weeks I'll get a 4 day weekend. Teaching really is a great job because of all the breaks.
