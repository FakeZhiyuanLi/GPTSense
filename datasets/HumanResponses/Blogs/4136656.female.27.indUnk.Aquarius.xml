      I love my family and friends they are my security blanket. I love to party and meet people from all walks of life. I love a good talk over a cup coffee with some smokes and just about anything under the sun. I'm carefree and footloose a dreamer not a doer a contradiction of all sorts an enigma that makes your headache and surrender, a paradox that leads you north then change directly to the east without saying a word. I’m quizzical, scattered and fickle but I’m comfortable with my own skin I don’t give a damn to what other people might say I choose the word respect of ones life without it the world is boring. Imagine four sides equal, excuse me I’m not a box I belong to the Air Sign meaning I go with the flow and hates to be pinned down…a rebel… a lover…a fighter…  My sex life is a rocking tornado that was before a few of my girl friends got married, parties were becoming less and less… I can easily achieve orgasms during daytime I had several multiple orgasms through the art of fingers and clitoral stimulation. My baby orgasms came from my 2ex bf. Pathetic isn’t? Well if only you know how it feels so great to be a woman so go figure and explore the womanish of a femme. I had countless one knights, I met them in bars with my girl friends. It was just pure drunken sex nothing more nothing less. The more men I mated the more it made me detached with my innermost feelings, my aggressions and frustrations made me horny especially when I’m intoxicated and my thinking was distorted I thought I could just hook up any guy in town have a good lay and have a passionate relationship after. So my quest for Mr. Right has just begun but it wasn’t that easy I have issues of my own, I have this fear of intimacy I have a façade that I’m rough and tough… I manage to play the games without thinking that there are rules to follow I break all of them. Society dictates, men are safe when they are swingers and women who bangs have to hide their skeletons in the closet. There are norms, dos and don’ts that Ma. Clara should follow to be accepted by society. I took the road less traveled needless to say and I’m a wreak.

      YOU DON'T KNOW ME - JANN ARDEN You give your hand to me,And then you say helloAnd I can hardly speak, My heart is beating soAnd anyone can tell, You think you know me wellBut you don't know meMmmmmNo you don't know the oneWho dreams of you at nightWho longs to kiss your lipsLongs to hold you tightOh I am just a friendThat's all i've ever beenCause you don't know meI never knew the art of makin' loveThough my heart aches with love for youAfraid and shy, I let my chance go byThe chance that you might love me tooYou give your hand to me and then you say goodbyeI watch you walk away beside the lucky guyOh you will never knowThe one who loves you soCause' you don't know meYou give your hand to me and then you say goodbyeI watch you walk away beside the lucky guyOh you will never knowThe one who loves you soCause' you don't know meohhhhh, no you don't know meYou don't know me.  WILDFLOWER She's faced the hardest times, You could imagineAnd many times, Her eyes fought back the tearsAnd when her youthful world,Was about to fall inEach time her slender shoulders,Bore the weight of all her fearsAnd a sorrow no one hearsStill rings in midnight silenceIn her earsLet her cry,For she's a ladyLet her dreamFor she's a childLet the rain,Fall down upon herShe's a free and gentle flowerGrowing wildAnd if by chance,I should hold herLet me hold her for a timeBut if allowed just one possessionI would pick her from the garden,To be mineUmmmm....................Be careful how you touch her,For she'll awakenAnd sleep's the only freedom,That she knowsAnd when you walk into her eyes,You won't believeThe way she's always payin'For a debt she never owesAnd a silent wind still blowsThat only she can hearAnd so, she goesLet her cry,For she's a ladyLet her dream,For she's a childLet the rainFall down upon herShe's a free and gentle flowerGrowing wildLet her cry,For she's a ladyLet her dream,For she's a childLet the rainFall down upon herShe's a free and gentle flowerGrowing wildShe's a flowerGrowing wildShe's free.......  This is my first blog entry. These are lyrics of my favorite songs, YOU DON’T KNOW ME- BY JANN ARDEN and WILDFLOWER (sorry I forgot the artist) these songs speak highly of my experiences in life, my failed short lived relationships, my quest for my knight in shining armor my distorted perception towards men and relationships….
