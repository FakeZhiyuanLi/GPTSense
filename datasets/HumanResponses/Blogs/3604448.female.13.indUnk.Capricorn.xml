        I hate this. I might not be able to go to California. I know, it sucks. My  dad is gonna decide if me and Diana are gonna be able to go. When I heard that, the first thing that came to mind was "That's messed up!" because you know it is. I hope I get to go back. A couple of days would be enough. Well I have to go. Later

        This time next week, I will be either sleeping in a hotel room or on the road. On Tuesday next week I will leave to go to California! Yay! I'm so excited that I even organized my closet and room earlier. In a way I kind of started packing. I put all the clothes that I'm not taking with me on a shelf in my closet, and organized all of my other clothes in a suit case in my closet. My dirty clothes went into the wash earlier. I'm so happy! Well, I wok up at 8:30 PM today I went to sleep at noon yesterday. My sleep schedule is so screwed up. I think FFR is realy addicting. It's like DDR, only you press the arrows on your keyboard instead of the dance mat thing. It's much easier than DDR. I gotta go. Later.

       Only about a week and a half until I can go back to California! I'm so happy I could scream! AHHHH! Dad should be home today. He went to Oklahoma on Friday on a business trip. I found another Evanescence song called Anything For You. John said he doesn't like Evanescence! I had to hold back from saying "What the hell is wrong with you!" But I didn't say it. He's got a problem if he doesn't like Evanescence. He's got bad taste I guess. Well anyways. Melissa 1: So how r u? Melissa 2: I'm not good! Melissa 1: Why not? Melissa 2: Because I'm gonna be in California only for a few freaking days! Melissa 1: I know I hate it too, but what are you gonna do about it? Melissa 2: Nothing! I've given up a while ago. Melissa 1: I want to go back home and stay there. Melissa 2: Face it! This is our new home. We're not gonna get to go back! Melissa 1: I'll never accept that. Never.

        Only 2 more weeks until I can go home! I still want to stay for more than just a couple of days. My dad plans on having us drive there and back. I can understand the reason to drive back but to California? Our stuff is in storage now so I have just a few items here in Texas. I really want to meet this Jonathan in person. It'll never happen, but I wonder what he looks like. He saw an outdated version of me and Sarah yesterday. Why the hell did I have to send that stupid outdated vid of me and Sarah!? Well I have to go. Later

        I can't wait to go back to California. But I'm stuck here in Texas until Bryon graduates. John said that he thought that Sarah is hotter than I am. What the hell is up with that? He says Sarah is hot but I have a sexy voice. I think that is so weird how he said that. That reminds me about this one time I was in Algebra, and Mr Pearce was talking about something when my friend Tiana leans back and says "Bryant likes" leans forward, Leans back again and says "YOU." And of course Bryant heard this and says ,in a 'what the hell are you talking about' voice, "What?" Of course one of my many closely guarded secrets was that I sorta had a crush on Bryant back then. What sucks is I had to move here about two months before school had ended. So, I had to start new right before school ended. Luckily I had made a few good friends before the end of the school year. I still cant wait until I can go back to California, wich will be at the end of the month.

       I feel like such an idiot. I willingly gave up my first kiss to Bradley, and my first french kiss to Vincent. We were playing spin the bottle when I spin and it lands on Bradley, so I kiss him. We stopped shortly after. So, we start to play truth or dare. Stupidly I choose dare. Sarah dares me to do her cat, or spend seven minutes in heaven with Vincent, but Bradley just has to say that we'd probably just sit there(so true, so true). So Bradley adds "and we have to hear you two makeout." Then Sarah says that she doesn't have a closet to use anyway, and that we just have to makeout in front of them for a minute or two. So, I nodded to Vincent, he stands up, then I stand up. We lean closer, and french kiss for about a minute. His tongue was moving around in my mouth so fast, so pationately. I felt the moment go by so quickly. Truthfuly I loved it but I hate the reason for it ,so that just kills it. This all happened on July second, a day that I will never forget.
