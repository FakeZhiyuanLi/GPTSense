      Finally, I have a chance to update.  *cheers* So, what has been going on in my wonderful world?  Well, let's see... Got to stay home alone tonight, and tomorrow too.  Parents are being quite kind doing this.  Now I feel warm and fuzzy inside! :) Watched a lot of the Olympics.  The USA's been doin' good. M*A*S*H started over again!   Finally!  Oh the joy!  Henry and Trapper and Radar and Frank!  No more preaching, for a few months now at least.  And that is all from Bran Muffin Central.  Abysinnia.

      Today is official Hug-Your-Tm day!!  Everyone go hug those wonderful little terrors! In other news... I had to go to church today.  One hour of my life thrown down the crapper, as my mom would say.  Otherwise I watched the Olympics.  USA won their first beach volleyball match.  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  *watches as Frenchies throw tomatoes at her*  Iraq won their soccer game today.  So nice to see FREE Iraqis playing sports along with Afganistan women.  This moment of wonderful history brought to you by the United States. *ducks more tomatoes from liberals and anti-war protesters* Gah.  Screw the liberals.  Frank: "Sir, is the officers latrine really destroyed?" Henry (mocking): "Is the officers latrine really destroyed?" Hawkeye: "Gone with the wind, Frank!"

      Watched the M*A*S*H move today... it's very funny but not as good as the TV show.  It was very confusing at first because all of the characters were different except Radar.  Nice 'n sunny today, hard to believe there's a hurricane a few states down from us.   Trapper: "Hi Frank." Frank: "That was totally uncalled for."  Hawkeye: "Why don't we just drop an atomic bomb?" Flagg: "Hey.  Don't try to make friends with me."

      I had to go to the dentist today... *shudders*.  I hate having people play around with my teeth especially since I can't see what their doing!  Our car got assaulted by a tree branch today in the Wegmans parking lot.  I could have sworn I told my Flagglets to protect the Trailblazer with their little lives... Hmmmm.  Maybe I need to pay them more for that kind of work.  "I'm not so think as you drunk I am." -Margaret "Shut your pie hole." -Steph K. Radar: "Sir, we're expecting an enemy parachute drop!" Henry: "Radar, thats the nicest thing I've heard all day."

      Tomorrow for dinner I will be condemned to the torture of... meatloaf.  Ugh *shudders*  I hate meatloaf.  It is the spawn of the Devil and of Flagglets.  Maybe I'll eat some of today's leftover chili.  Yum.  "Yea all the food got here ok... except for the olives.  For some reason they all turned black." -Henry "That's just my Corporal riding around in a sheet.  There's so little for the men to do."  -Henry

      Watched some of the original M*A*S*Hes today... including the one where Frank and the Spazz charge Henry with treason.  *beats Frank over the head with a heavy object*  Poor Henry.  But Radar tells off a General.  He's so cute when he's mad :) Also watched the first Flagg episode.  *tries to cuddle her horde of Flagglets*  Henry also gets pretty beat up in that episode.  Why do they like being mean to him?  *tries to cuddle Henry, Flagglets and Radar at the same time but doesn't succeed* I love my M*A*S*H people.  Hi Colonel Koetzle!  I locked Frank in the bathroom today :) *is extremely proud of herself* *Grabs Henry and hugs him as he tries to prevent Hawkeye from breaking my moms vase* Thats all for now, roger will go over and out.  Oh by the way BUSH CHENEY 04 and GO ILLINOIS

      God I hate Holz.  Wish I could beat him over the head with something blunt and hard.  But ignore my violent tendancies.  GO TO  urlLink www.bestcareanywhere.net  and click on the bulleten board.  My name is Silver Eagle there too.  Revel in the randomness.  *runs off to hug her M*A*S*H DVDs* I hate the time thing on this... "Radar, whatever it is, cancel it, copy it, or order 5 more." -Henry Henry: "I wish I knew what was going on here." Radar: "I'll tell you later, sir." Henry: "You always say that Radar but you never do."

      Yuck, school shopping 2 days in a row... not like I need a reminder that September is quickly approching.  Haven't had much time for the computer because of projects and junk like that.  Making  urlLink muffinfilm  tee shirts has absorbed me for a few days.  Nothing good on M*A*S*H... can't wait for the good seasons to start up again.   "Don't move Korea, this is a stickup." -Henry Blake "Don't play dumb with me because I can do it better than you can." -Flagg

      Just hanging around again today.  FF.net is driving me nuts.  Nobody's updating on the BCA message board either.  Oh well.  Now I've got to go think of a science project.  Blech.  I hate school very very much.  At least M*A*S*H is on today...

      Yay it works.  If I can possibly keep my bloodshot eyes fixated on the computer any longer, I'll go find a picture host so I can stick some M*A*S*H pictures on this thing.  Chinese leftovers=bad stomach.  You get the idea.
