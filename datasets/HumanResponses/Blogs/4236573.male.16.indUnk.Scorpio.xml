      new discovery. i like oasis. i bought this album today:       it's called 'what's the story, morning glory?'. this cd has a really good song on it called 'wonderwall'. you've probably heard it heaps of times before, but like me, never really bothered to delve any deeper than the casual radio listening.  "And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would Like to say to you But I don’t know how."  ah, such a familiar concept for us teenagers, hm? i guess i like it because it talks about reality, and mixes it with some familiar themes, like the relationship here.  "Because maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me ? And after all You’re my wonderwall."  what got me interested in this song all of a sudden? one of my mates at school asked about the song, he new a couple of lyrics but didn't know anything else about it. this led to the whole group of us standing around, singing this. straight after school i went to sanity and bought the album. em:  "I don’t believe that anybody Feels the way I do About you now."

      i made this:     me: i guess i'm pretty interested in website design and such. i've had a heap of websites over the past few years, but they've all gone down the drain for various reasons. i usually fall out of contant with the host or lose interest or something... i think sector seven, my last project is still up. you can see it as sector-seven.net.  i do love film more though. i'm really into directing and shooting short films. i just finished a school project for drama, which was a transformation of act i, scene ii from a midsummer night's dream, by will shakespeare. it turned out pretty well considering i shot it in about 60 mins over three lunchtimes at school, with no budget and crappy school equipment. i might be able to get that online for people to watch.  life update: i'm pretty happy at the moment. sometimes life can get you down, no matter how hard you try to stay positive, but hey. my girlfriend is great, so life is really good.

      i'm working on a screenplay at the moment, but i don't have a title for it. it's less than two pages long at the moment but i thought i'd put it on here incase anyone was curious:   urlLink http://home.ripway.com/2004-8/158847/untitled.doc   it's my first attempt at writing a screenplay, so it's probably really crap.

      i got some new dvds today:     if you can't see, it's the matrix revolutions and lord of the rings: rotk. so, i got these dvds are i started thinking, these are the finales to the biggest trilogies in what? ever? anyways, i noticed some similarites in the plot. they might be a little fetched, but bear with me.  apocolyptic battles: in tmr, there is the battle for zion involving the hundreds of thousands of sentinels, and the inhabitants of the last human civilization. you could say, a battle for mankind? juxtaposed to rtok, we have the battle for middle earth. there's minas tirath, and palenor fields...it's another battle for mans survival.  path of the hobbits: in rotk we follow the final parts of frodo and sam's story, as they infiltrate that evil place and breach the inner walls of mount doom to destroy the one ring. in tmr, our hobbits are neo and trinity, on their way into the massive machine city. Once there neo must fight Smith(gollum) to reclaim the matrix(one ring) and in doing so save humanity. of course...sam and frodo don't die, but i'll overlook that.  i don't know...i'm probably just tired and delusional. post some comments if you find some more similarities, or to yell at me. whatever.
