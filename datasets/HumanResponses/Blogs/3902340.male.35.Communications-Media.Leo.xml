      4-30-04  20H 07  &nbsp;  Dinner at Le Cockney Tavern again! My feet are too tired to travel downtown and I’ve ruled out a fine restaurant again. The good ones are full on a Friday night anyway, and I’m not going alone. I just had another street skirmish with the same overly aggressive strip club doorman. He tried to grab my coat again but I was ready for him. He mumbled something about “Hey Bullshit” and I answered with an authoritative “Fuck you” and he disappeared pretty quickly. The French are not a tall people. It’s so easy to pick out the North Americans on the Metro. I’m about 5’8” and I tower over the French. Wasn’t Napoleon knee-high to a grasshopper himself?  &nbsp;  I finished the MacDonald book. Whew. It was heavy. I’ve thought about suggesting it to Val, but I think it would be too heavy. She’s probably already read it, anyhow. I’ve thought a lot about her this week, realizing that April 26th marked two years since the sale of the house, and our official separation. (The divorce was legal on October 1st - a year and a half ago.) I think about how much fun we might have had in Paris, at least in the early days, before whatever went wrong did.  &nbsp;  Meanwhile, I got an email from T. (from I.) today. I think she’s anxious about me, testing the water to see if I’d react. I’m not sure what her deal is, but I think she might have been freaked out initially by what Jeanine calls my “freaky” email behavior. It was a tactical error, OK? Nervous pussy. That’s me! Truth is I didn’t have to be nervous when I was married!  &nbsp;  I had a weird experience in the Juliet Metro station. I was&nbsp;ambling along&nbsp;like a tourist and this African woman ran right into the back of me. I couldn’t see who it was, so I recoiled, then spun around thinking it might be a pickpocket. I think she was mortified when she saw my reaction. She started to squawk away in French to me. Probably “Oh so you thought I was trying to steal from you!” She might have even suggested it was racially motivated, I’m not sure. Truth is she was talking away on her cell phone and wasn’t watching where in the frig she was going.&nbsp; All the literature warns ad nauseum about pickpockets. Just when I was starting to feel a little more comfortable in this metropolis of 10 million!  &nbsp;  Oh well, I feel my time is winding down here. I’m really glad for the side trip to Scotland. And it’s a quick social visit, no laborious treks, just friendship and good company. The barkeep has arrived, the guy from my first night here. He reminds me of Dale. He’d fit right in here. All his people were French, easy to tell.  &nbsp;  In the middle of the night, I’m positive I heard our Italian friend from the Café Lux Bar stomp drunkenly down Rue Lepic screaming foreign curses at her boyfriend. Some of it was in English. “Fuck you, mister. You’re through! That’s it. You’re through!” And he was yelling “Malena. That’s enough!” I heard a car start and drive off. Drunk driver, I thought. Those Italian girls are fiery little trollops!  &nbsp;  Random Note: One this is for sure. Wherever the bill says “service et compris,” the service tends to suck.  &nbsp;  Today, I was befriended by the proprietor of a café. His waitress was quite aggressive and in my face with unexpected French phrases. I panicked. “Mon Francais et terrible,” I offered humbly. She hollered for, let’s call him Maurice. He was a cross between Mel (Vic Tayback) the diner cook from TV’s “Alice” and porn star Ron Jeremy with a bit of our Toronto baker-friend Pasquale thrown in for good measure. He was super friendly and asked in French if I was from Toronto, when I answered that I was from Canada. Then he said good naturedly, also in French, “How can you not speak French if you are from Canada?” I have no problem understanding his French. Anyway, he explained every detail of the menu proudly in broken English, then processed my order, turned out the lights in the cafe, and he and his waitress sat down for their lunch. Then loud talking and animated discourse with his unfriendly waitress, and the remaining patrons followed. She’d get up for the few regulars that would straggle in. Everything stops between 2 and 3pm in Paris. Most shops close. Imagine closing a shop in the middle of the work day! Maurice was a very warm guy and thanked me for stopping by.  &nbsp;  Ohh. There’s instant drama here at Le Cockney Tavern! An English speaking woman has just had her purse or wallet stolen in front of her eyes. She’s freaking. What’s weird is that the staff doesn’t seem to care in the least. The woman has gone off into the street now to look for the perp, I guess. Whoa, that was eerie. Back to the apartment now.

      4-30-04  15H 36&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today is the last full day in Paris. Loud construction next door and a noisy maid upstairs pried me from my bed this morning at the ungodly hour of 9:30am! My sleep was not the best last night. It was full of unpleasant dreams I’m sure due to my poor, alcohol-laden holiday diet. Too much bread and dairy, not enough fruits and vegetables!   I’m just about finished the Anne Marie MacDonald book. It’s an epic, but also deals with some heavy sexual abuse suffered by the main character when she was nine years old. As the story concludes, it becomes quite heavy and introspective – yet I can’t seem to put it down. 700+ pages. I checked my email again this morning and had one from Mike. I just can’t tell how he’s reacting to this&nbsp;new business&nbsp;deal It brings up a lot of issues, like who owns the deal and how the money is split. I don’t think he likes the idea of having a partner and I’ll be damned if I am going to become an employee again. He knows that. We just need to talk it through. Good business and relationships is hard work, man. Rain has been threatening all day. In fact, I guarantee that I’ll see some drops before I get home.  &nbsp;  Heidi is going to meet me at Prestwick Airport south of Glasgow in the morning. What a doll! It will be good to see her, and it’ll be nice to have familiar company. There’s still no sign of S, my potential English girl back in Vancouver. I just don’t know what to think of that. I wish people could just be honest. A doode can take it! Know what I’m sayin’? Dammit, I’m tired and I didn’t really get  that  drunk last night. I just completed 8 postcards to send home. I don’t think I’ll take gifts back, other than something for the girls in the office. Chocolates maybe. It’s just too much to think about. By the way, I found two Hohner Blues Band harmonicas, one in D and one in F for OB. I’ll send them along with OE’s prayer card when I get back. Did I already mention this? I’m looking forward to getting a great bottle of Scotch from Cadenhead’s Whiskey Shop on The Royal Mile in Edinburgh. I know a little bit more about&nbsp;Scotch now, compared with last summer.&nbsp;My collection is coming along nicely!  &nbsp;  Hey, 10 Eastern European countries will join the EU tomorrow, May 1st. It becomes the world’s largest trading block with a combined population of 450 million. I’m not sure if that’s good or bad for Europe. It could be the beginning of the homogenization of it all. It does mean, however, that a new marketplace has opened up for underperforming, restricted economies. It might give Global Americanization a run for its money…maybe not. What the fuck do I know?

      4-29-04  12H 50&nbsp; &nbsp;  J’ai arrive en Versailles au Rive Gauche. The Palace is around the corner and I’ve taken refuge in a pizza joint with the motto, “We’ve Got a Passion for Pizza.” It’s obviously designed for travelers, and is kitty corner to junk shops and the local McDonalds. I just can’t bring myself to go to McDonalds in France! I’ll take the Anglo pizza place instead.  &nbsp;  The train is very efficient. But I almost got off on the wrong track, literally missing the first train. It looked like I’d have to wait up to 25 minutes for the next one. But just ten minutes later, voila…the second one appeared. It was very un-crowded and scenic as we rolled through the hilly suburbs of Paris.  &nbsp;  The pizza was less than spectacular though, and I’ve just noticed all the American license plates on the wall. Oh how gross! It’s a nice place. It just seems a little over-the-top with all the Americana. Maybe it’s just me, “oversensitive Canadian” all of a sudden.  &nbsp;  Did I mention meeting “Bob and Sue” from Toronto on the Metro the other day? They reminded me of Graham and Dorothy Sullivan, except a little more gung-ho. Bob was lugging a great big suitcase with a Canadian flag on it down the Metro steps. So I says “How’s it going eh?” and Bob says “We’re Bob and Sue from Toronto” and I says “Shawn from Vancouver/Nova Scotia.” They’d been traveling all over Europe since September. Jeez the lifestyle, eh? Random Note: I must order a new credit card. My magnetic strip ist kaput!

      4-28-04  20H 26  &nbsp;  What a nice quiet day today. After walking for five days straight, I gave my feet some rest. The day started with a leisurely breakfast of croissants, berries, and Special K. My sleep was good, although I stayed up until at least 1:30am reading the Anne-Marie MacDonald epic, “As the Crow Flies.” I’ve had it since Christmas and haven’t even had a chance to open it. It isn’t disappointing, that’s for sure! In fact, I didn’t leave the apartment today until 2pm because I was glued to the pages. I finally got out to scope out the Porte Maillot Metro station in advance of my Beauvais trip on Saturday morning. Good thing I did! It’s smack dab in the middle of a roundabout amidst freeway exits and on-ramps. I reckon 40-45 minutes should give me twice the time I need to get there on Saturday morning. I talked with Rob on the phone briefly last night. His big Paris suggestion is to introduce myself to as many girls as possible with “Bonjour. Je m’appelles Claude!” LOL  &nbsp;  I’m eating tonight at another bar. The food is good, and it’s just so much more conducive to dining single. I passed some great looking restaurants, but I’ve no desire to go in and eat alone. Dining and sleeping single are the two biggest drawbacks of traveling solo. I suppose if I was really motivated, I could fix both of things by flashing a few Euros around downtown and using the name Claude! I just realized why there’s no place on the credit card receipt to sign off on a tip. It appears that “service en compris” means the tip is included. Fuck! Now I figure it out.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I decided to set out of town tomorrow to Versailles to see the Palace, plus to get out of Paris for the day. I’m getting cabin fever. I’ll take the train which means I should get to see some countryside, and my feet are feeling pretty good after an easy day today. The weather has turned cloudy, and even if it doesn’t improve, I had a great run, and have a good tan early on. I’m looking forward to seeing Heidi. This is normally the point in the trip where I would get in a rental car and bolt. But, I’m really freaked out about driving in and around Paris. Maybe if I had a co-pilot to read the map. I know I would not drive in London. Not even New York. It’s too crazy and parking is a bitch.

      4-27-04  20H 00&nbsp; &nbsp;  I’m back at Le Cockney Tavern for a beer and a burger trying to take it a little easier tonight, after the drunkard’s dream last night.  &nbsp;  It was a busy day today, with a walk across the Seine in front of the Assemble Nationale. I stopped at the Musee Rodin where I saw some of his most famous sculptures, the highlight of course being the “Thinking Man.” From there, I walked throughout the neighbourhood, past the Prime Minister’s house. I ended up at the Musee D’Orsay, which was very good. They had great paintings by Degas, Manet, Monet, etc. My toe was bothering me again (blisters), so I sat my arse down and applied by bandage right there in the museum. Relief! The pharmacist could not present me with anything resembling a band-aid. Apparently there is no translation for Band-Aid. She did fix me up with a small bandage after much discourse, me trying in simple English to explain the concept of the fucking band aid. Jesus Christ, Almighty.  &nbsp;  After a slow start (nursing hangover) this morning, I went to the internet café to check my email. I realize how few people know that I’m away. I guess I kinda kept this one under the radar. I also sneaked a peak at my work/home email, delighted to find that it’s quiet work-wise. Some of my friends had emailed the home account, like Gord and Rob. I guess I didn’t even tell them exactly when I was going, and that I’d be using my hotmail. Anyway, I was glad to see the S. contract waiting for me. I should print it off, sign it, and fax it from Paris, just to get it happening. Then again, I’m on vacation. I will print it off and fax it tomorrow. Money is money, for fuck’s sakes. Maybe it’s something that Cecile can help me with!?  &nbsp;  Tonight is going to be a quiet one after last night’s fun at the Lux Bar. But if I can’t sleep, I’m going across the street.  &nbsp;  I’m done with museums. My three-day pass expires today, and my feet are killing me (toe)! I may think about renting a car and getting into the country-side. But, Cecile has scared me from attempting to drive in the city. When I get back, I’ll look up the rental places in the phone book.  &nbsp;  An autre raison pour telephoner Cecile! Random note: The song playing in the pub is “How Beautiful is the Body of Christ?” I think it’s Amy Grant. It’s a little weird for a pub but nobody notices. I’m making a list of gifts that I need to get for friends. It’s the red light district, so I’m thinking about something from the Erotica Museum for Paula (an excuse to call and say hi) and maybe a French dildo for J. She’s probably got more than one! She takes her pleasure seriously… If I buy porn for Rob, there’s Theresa’s reaction to consider, not to mention Canadian customs. “Yes Sir, I’ve go booze, porn, and a big dildo to declare…

      2-26-04  23H 00   There’s a secondary crowd cycling in now. The say Parisians don’t get going until 11pm. So here it is! Only two tables left. Je suis l’anglais seulement. I feel like such an observer, taking notes on society. It’s already later than I’ve been up all week. C’est bon! This whole experience is cathartic, in a way. The guy at the next table is testing his cell phone rings. First a bird chirping and now bag pipe tunes. Hilarious. I think the couple next to him is German. The waiter is using English as a medium language and we’re all just getting by.  &nbsp;  Did I mention that the Lux Bar is mentioned in my book on Paris? Another passerby is subjected to cat calls, en Francais.  &nbsp;  Those are definitely German cigarettes. I could start so easily on those sons o’whores. But, I won’t. Remember Chernobyl!?  &nbsp;  Editor’s Note: He’s really drunk now.  &nbsp;  Another couple lured from the sidewalk with cat calls from the gallery. Wish I had my camera…

      2-26-04  21H 55  &nbsp;  I spent some time with CNN International before I came out this evening. Daljeet Dhaliwal was great tonight. The entire deal was anchored from London. I can tell. The show that followed also featured two Brits, but I think they were out of Atlanta. Anyway, I’m not so negative on CNN International. It’s so much less American tonight.  &nbsp;  The entrecote is delicious, even though it’s cooked very medium. Very Le Gavroche! Parts are much more medium than my taste. Ca c’est OK. C’est Paris! Cecile laughed when I proclaimed this the other day. Cecile…  &nbsp;  Editor’s note: Getting drunker now. Handwriting is getting sloppy.  &nbsp;  It’s so true. 10 million people. Flying into Paris, it looks like farmland. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Then you get in here and there isn’t an inch of free space. It’s just like London, with five storey buildings with not a millimeter between them. The difference is it’s more Mediterranean looking, with shutters on every window, everything white-washed. It’s much like Sydney, Australia - my all-time favorite city. I’d like to live and work there still.  &nbsp;  I can’t believe I’ve let four nights go without getting out with the locals. Ca c’est terrifique! Across the street: Pharmacie Lepic and Tele France Video Club, where you can order a movie from an ATM-style machine. A neighbourhood dog has just arrived on the scene. A light brown lab. She’s sweet and I bet she doesn’t understand a word of English. She’s looking for some love. J’aime le chien! Up the street Lintox Clubwear and Streetwear, Autour de Midi et Minuit, Nicholas-Wines.com, et Saint Dreux (Boulanger). A young teen couple just walked by, the girl wishing every diner “bon appetite.” I think she wishes she was 25 and sitting here with her beau. Audi Guy pulled up 20 minutes ago, loud music blaring. He’s totally euro trash. He parked illegally. Opps… Thought he was leaving. I guess he went back to get his Robbie Williams CD.  &nbsp;  Robbie Williams is everywhere! At Pont de Neuf, I saw an open air karaoke session with a poor French guy with horrible tone attempting to sing “Real Love,” half in English, half in French. It was horrible, just horrible. He is the William Hung of France. (I’m referring to the worst American Idol audition of this past season.) Then tonight, I saw an ad on telly featuring a guy who pulls up to a parking meter, sees the meter maid coming, and has no change so he starts to karaoke in order to raise meter fare. As he croons “Real Love,” the real Robbie walks by, stops, corrects the words, and contributes some money to the meter fund. Both doode and meter maid are stunned. I didn’t catch the company name. Quelle Domage!  &nbsp;  I got a return email from Shango today. This is such a Shango city. He would die here. C’est tres exotique. The sense of artistry is out of this world. Fuck, the world is a big place, and our last two generations are really the ones who have had unfettered access. First came the ability to travel long distances in a short amount of time, and now cost is not so much an issue as it once was. I am fortunate as I have nothing more to spend money on than lifestyle. I’m single, no kids. This is the time I will remember when I’m old. New York, London, Paris, Toronto, Sydney, Los Angeles, Chicago…I’ve done it all and I’m not even 35. It’s a good basis for reference and thought.  &nbsp;  Editors Note: Even drunker now.  &nbsp;  Last night I watched the concert for Nelson Mandela and Aids relief in Africa, 46664.com. Dedicate a minute of your life to Aids. It was on MTV France (Europe). U2, Eurythmics, Beyonce, Youssou N’Dour, etc. And there he was: Bill Clinton, god dammit. America would be so much better off if he were still President. He is so educated, so worldly, so wise, and so fallible.  &nbsp;  I found my way to the Eiffel Tower today. It’s striking, but not as I had imagined. There’s a great view of the city, but it’s not viewed easily from everywhere. That’s because all streets are hidden in 5-storey troughs, I’ve only seen the tower twice, both times on the hills of Montmartre. It was touristy, but a must nonetheless. It’s got security extraordinaire with Army guys with AK47’s. I imagine if you’re going to go for Paris, it’s the Metro or the Eiffel Tower – but not with these guys on guard. Although, I don’t imagine France is that high on the hit list due to Jacques Chirac’s stance on Iraq.  &nbsp;  I have no croissants for the morning. Woe is the pity. More is the pity? Whatever, I’m drunk. What is that expression anyway?  &nbsp;  By the way, the Italian girl ditched a long time ago. And, there is a steady stream of renters at the video rental machine. Fuck, this weather is perfect. OB said they had snow on the weekend. Sacre blue!

      2-26-04  21:12H&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well you can always depend on Pops for a little support, at least almost always. I just gave him a call with the update. It’s so obvious that he would probably like to travel, but he’s got issues. Money, extravagance, or fear of it, and E’s health. Although I think the latter is more of an excuse than anything. Could just be another symptom of "Scotia Disease." Colin and I are so lucky to have “gotten out” of Nova Scotia.&nbsp;I remember how terribly bored I was there. Hell, I’m bored now and I fly so often I make birds jealous! I must say that I’m more fulfilled now with all the physical activity and mental extra-curriculars such as fiddle lessons. Balance is elusive. One could spend most of one’s time trying to achieve it, and miss the joys of living in the here and now. We just get glimpses of the sacred balance. It’s like a brief window opens up, the curtain parts, and there it is. Then it’s gone again. I think how deeply you can connect with your passion on a daily basis determines how many glimpses you get behind the curtain. Insert another 0.40 Euro for another peek! (Euro bathroom reference)  &nbsp;  Show me a person who dares to be themselves to a fault, to allow their true thoughts, feelings, and raison d’etre to be present at all times and I’ll show you a powerful person. Most of us never dare to scratch the surface of ourselves too deep. We shouldn’t over analyze these things – only when we’re consuming good drink in Montmarte – yet live to the max every day. Weed out those that won’t or can’t live to be real. I’m not sure that any of these thoughts are new, just remembered anew.  &nbsp;  I’m presently sitting at the Café Lux Bar, across the street from Rue Lepic Studios, deciding whether or not to have something to eat. No one is eating, just drinking, and smoking. Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City was right! Paris equals cigarettes and dog poo, everywhere! Another random thought: Maybe my answer to sleepless nights is to stay up later!? J  &nbsp;  I called S. tonight, from Paris. There’s something about her that I don’t want to give up on. I left the number of the apartment. I really don’t expect a call back in France. But, I’ll know like a two-by-four over the head, that the certain feeling is mutual if she does call. If I read this many years from now, and nothing ever happened, S. is the girl from Manchester who is a workaholic geologist. If this connection doesn’t bear fruit, I shall move on poste-haste. I’m bringing a woman back to Paris next time, goddammit.  &nbsp;  Editor's Note: Nothing ever happened with S.  &nbsp;  Oh, I’ve figured out how to get to Paris Beauvais Airport. There’s a shuttle that leaves at 6:55am from Charles DeGaulle Etoille Metro. I’ll scope it out tomorrow. It’s just 10 euro each way (one hour NW of Paris).  &nbsp;  One thing I still can’t get over is the price of a drink in Paris. On average, it’s 7 euro 50 for a pint of friggin’ beer. C’est La Vie. OK. The crowd at the café just got really interesting. A woman just started yelling “Kareem. Ciao Bella! Donnez moi ton numero de telephone.” She’s very Italian. He’s very gay. He was just walking down the street. She’s sitting with two other gay dudes. C’est Europe, it’s hard to tell. It seems as though I’ve stumbled on the local hangout. I’ve watched from my troisieme etage as this place rocks late into the night, well after 4am. Now I’m afraid I may succumb to its charms! The Italian girl has disappeared. Her drink remains. Perhaps she has cornered Kareem? I ordered the Entrecote, medium. I guess I’ve made the commitment. J She’s back! She was in the toilette. I wonder if she had her 0.40 euro?

      4-26-04  14:25H&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Another night of restless sleep. But what began well ended well, and I got up again today at 10H! After getting my first French telephone call from Cecile letting me know that the maid is coming Thursday, I headed out on the #2 to Pere Lachaise cemetery to see dead people. It wasn’t any more striking than the Cemetiere de Montmartre – very beautiful and peaceful. The grave of Jim Morrison was uneventful. The usual crowd of celebrity grave watchers just like me. But, you can’t visit Paris and not visit Jim! It brings to mind the classic visit that Mike and I made to Jimi Hendrix’s grave in Seattle. We both had a Budweiser and Mike got his photo taken next to the headstone, looking contemplative and solemn. Reverence, man. Even though Jimi’s gravestone was tiny, at least there was an image of his guitar etched in the stone. With Jim, there were just bolts sticking out of the cement where a bust once stood, before being vandalized. I just don’t know what motivates people to vandalize a grave. You can go into the Louvre and walk right up and put your hands on a Rembrandt if you must, but nobody does!  &nbsp;  From Pere Lachaise, I rode all the way back across the blue line to Charles de Gaulle Etoille (Arc de Triomphe &amp; Champs Elysees). I was stopped by a guy with a New York accent asking for someone who spoke English. He was looking for a way to get to CDG airport. I pointed him toward the train, and then he tells me a sob story of being pick-pocketed and needing to find a cheaper way. He was calm and I didn’t get a scam vibe, so I gave him 5 Euros for his troubles. Good Kharma. And judging from his reaction, I think I made his day.  &nbsp;  Je suis enroute de la Tour Eiffel. Je reste ici dan la rue Kleber…sitting in the shade on a sunny patio, streetside at the Fleurus Café. I’ve been watching a motorcade that is about to depart from a government building down the street. It has something to do with Burkina Faso. It’s too big an affair to be anything less than a head of state. The tip off is the van load of African media sitting in wait. La Circulation has just finished redirecting the traffic and shutting the street for a short time. The party must have moved on.  &nbsp;  The weather has been fantastic since I arrived. Blue skies and temperature right at 20 degrees Celsius each day. I think I‘m getting a fucking tan! It just warm enough that I can see the heat rising off the sidewalks, maybe 24? I haven’t been anticipating the Eiffel Tower, simply because it seems so touristy. But the Musee D’Orsay is closed today, so what the fuck? Eh! I’m not even sure what I’ll do after that.

      4-25-04  18:00H  &nbsp;  It’s Sunday today, which turned out to be a great day to do the Louvre. It was a lot to take in, and surprisingly moving. In fact, one could spend three days in there. Da Vinci’s Monna Lisa is of course the highlight, but hardly the lone star. There’s Rembrandts, Rubens, Michelangelos, etc, etc, etc. I was awestruck to think of all that art, all that history in one place. And there’s still so much of Paris to see! The city reveals itself with every hour spent: little moments, a street performer, a couple’s embrace, a street scene.  &nbsp;  On the Metro on the way to the Louvre, a young woman raced to get on the train ahead of two boys with accordions. I watched curiously as she slung a drape between two vertical poles and began to put on a puppet show to a soundtrack on a boom box. It lasted two stops, and several people in the car rewarded her with change. One African woman flashed me that “Ca C’est Paris” smile. Yesterday at the Metro some guy got on and did a little announcement to the whole car, a soliloquy, something about bringing peace to the world and wishes for a nice day.  &nbsp;  The easiest thing about Paris is the Metro. There are two stops right by Rue Lepic, one half a block away and the other about four. The latter being just down the street from the internet café, where I learned the difference between an English and a French computer keyboard. My feet are quite tired, but I’m gonna make it! That reminds me. I must pick up some band aids!  &nbsp;  I’m having some vivid dreams, having to do with fulfillment. I seem to be questioning still who I am and where I am going. Paris forces you to ask the hard questions, or should I say she reminds you to ask yourself. Or, maybe I’m just full of shit! I do realize that in North America, we’re living in an over-commercialized Wal*Mart lifestyle, where we live apart from our neighbours and are driven to acquire more and more stuff. I wonder if the majority of Parisian’s can imagine what it’s like to live in 2000+ square feet of living space, on an acre of land, with two SUV’s in the driveway? They’d say we’re fucking crazy to live a mile from the baker, the cheese store, or the corner wine seller. The emphasis here is so much more social. It’s about the daily interaction&nbsp;between people. I understand the French now more than I ever have. It’s a culture built on verbal and social interaction, and romance&nbsp;avec passion – which of course can be fiery! i.e. the rise and fall of the French Empire, French Revolution, and the legendary, historical Government about-faces. It all contributes to a sort of laissez-faire attitude. i.e. occupation of WWII. I think the attitude was pretty much, “Oh fuck it. Will the boite be open as usual?”  &nbsp;  Now, am I prepared to sell my car, my belongings, and move to Paris? No. But it reminds me that we might all give over more often to the romantic side, take flight in fancy, dare to dream, and say what must be said, to live with reckless abandon, with passion!  &nbsp;  One of the issues that’s sticking in my craw is Iraq. The further I get from home, and American media, the more I can see what is going on, or shall I say what is currently wrong with America. The more I read and see of the world media, what I see on CNN International becomes more irrelevant. Why are the Bush contradictions so evident to the world but not to Americans? Why do they allow their sons and daughters to die by the hundreds – soon to be thousands, while they give Osama a free pass? Are they really sheep? What about their economy? Are they blind? How big a hole have they dug with regard to the national debt? They’ve said “fuck the world” out of one side of their mouth and “buy our goods” out of the other side. The time is growing near when the world will be sick and tired watching American TV teens dating each other on MTV Europe, etc. It's so insipid. Hell, China already makes all their clothes, shoes, household goods and Japan and Korea make the automobiles and electronics. Anyway, I see few Americans in Paris right now. And think France was always on their side. Think: Statue of Liberty. Nuff said. Bring Clinton back. He studied at Oxford! Decision made: Not going back to America unless there’s a regime change in November! End of political diatribe.  &nbsp;  I love watching the old French guys grooving down the road, cigarette in mouth. Sometimes a big belly, other times not. Some with chapeau, others not. I’m also struck by how multicultural it is here. Asians. Africans. Middle Easterners.  &nbsp;  I haven’t had a vacation quite like this in a long time. It’s nice, slow, and unhurried. I’m even beginning to think in French phrases. The more comfortable I get, the better the response from the locals. I do miss the company of a woman. This is the ideal couple city. I’m not coming back without a girlfriend or a wife!  &nbsp;  Yesterday was another gorgeous day. A good stretch of “Il fait beau!” I walked around Ille de la Cite, visited Notre Dame de Paris, bought a prayer card for Elizabeth, the Rosary. Hail Mary… It was a huge church built @ 1200 but was totally eclipsed by the Sainte Chapelle beside the Palais de Justice. That also dates back to about 1247 and was absolutely magnificent. It’s much smaller, two storey, with stained glass from floor to ceiling on all sides. The glass tells the story of Christ up to through the building of Ste. Chapelle and on through to the apocalypse. If you follow pane-by-pane from bottom to top, right to left, the story unfolds chronologically. Magnifiique! Right up there with the Louvre.  &nbsp;  I also walked through what I thought was the Right, but in fact was the Left Bank. It was everything I had heard about and more: streets and alleys of restaurants and shops for miles. Oh the humanity!  &nbsp;  The night before last I had a radio dream. I’ve had lots of those but this one was different. It seemed to suggest to me that I should find a way to create radio again, maybe via the internet. I saw a home studio and everything. Oh the time!! What is my head trying to tell me? This I do not need an answer for on day three!  &nbsp;  Oh I booked a quick trip to see Heidi in Edinburgh Saturday and Sunday next weekend for just 94 euros return on Ryan Air. I’ll get a chance to poke around the Royal Mile once more and an opportunity to get a great bottle of Scotch and hang out with the Heidster. Can’t beat the price! Hope it works well. Well my dinner here at the Cockney Tavern was good once again. It’s a great place to have a pint and write up a storm. Oh boy. What will tomorrow bring?

      4-23-04  14:30H  &nbsp;  What a difference a day makes! Sleep, sleep, sleep. I’ve adjusted to the time change and started my day at the crack of nine to the sound of the accordion. It’s an old Frenchman sitting on the street outside the apartment. I opened the shutters to let in the sound and light. Leftover baguette (boul compagne), croissant, berries, and gruyere cheese. I decided to explore the neighbourhood of Montmartre today, consulting “Memorable Walks in Paris.”  &nbsp;  After showering to the accordion music wafting up from outside, I gathered my things and headed uphill to some stunning views of Paris down cobblestoned streets and terraces. The sky was a beautiful California blue. The leaves are about 3-4 weeks behind Vancouver, but the birds are singing and the blossoms are on the trees.  &nbsp;  The sun is warm, but not hot, and there’s a nice breeze. Montmartre is the neighbourhood of Latrec, Picasso, Van Gogh, Salvador Dali, etc…all having spent time here and created pivotal works, inspired by the city and her people. The Sacre Coeur was busy but impressive, with the nuns choir singing at a noon mass. The much older St. Pierre de Montmartre was consecrated in 1147 and is much less of a tourist hangout. It seems that people make a pilgrimage to Sacre Coeur, and lounge about its steps most unceremoniously. I was met with my first view of la Tour Eiffel from the steps of Sacre Coeur. It was surreal to look over the city and see the tower dark against the bright hazy sky. Anti-climatic, or poignant? These are the thoughts that begin to invade the mind where the monotony of work once resided.  &nbsp;  I have stopped at “Le Cockney Tavern” for a good ole Kilkenny, 7€50 per pint. (That’s a good $11 for a beer!) The only thing English about this place is the décor. Now I know how Susan must feel when she goes to the Outback Steakhouse. G’day Mate! I found a good little internet café, already emailed OB, Colin, etc.

      4-22-04  20:08 H  &nbsp;  There is really only one way to spend one’s first evening in Paris: sipping red wine and eating cheese and raspberries in the apartment, at a table overlooking a lively street in Montmartre.  &nbsp;  I flew all day and all night from Vancouver, arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport at 8:20am. After a one-hour wait in a holding area, customs officials finally arrived to hustle the crowd through to baggage. No questions, no notice, no stamp for the passport. It’s certainly not like trying to enter the USA, our neighbours. I almost left the airport without my luggage due to poor signage and the crush of humanity trying to get somewhere, anywhere! The cab ride was uneventful. Another Mercedes, and speeds averaging 140km. I love Europe!  &nbsp;  I arrived at 9 Rue Lepic to find nobody waiting for me. Calm prevailed, and Cecile arrived within about ten minutes to thoroughly review the details. The “maid,” an older French man, was cleaning. Cecile was the first French woman I encountered so far on my trip. She just had that “thing” – a very sexy presence that I imagine all European women must share. (With my track record, she’s probably a lesbian. Ha!)  &nbsp;  Even though many of the shops are closing, the street below continues to bustle. Frenchmen hustling home after working late. Couples strolling. Older women with dogs collecting ingredients for a late supper. There’s an old lady across the street who is trying not to linger in the window, but she’s curious about me, her new neighbour. It’s her street, after all. 9 Rue Lepic must provide her with lots of fresh excitement.  &nbsp;  Daljeet Dahliwal is on the TV, on CNN International. She must have been offered big dough to leave BBC World. I saw her on Letterman once. He was smitten. And so was I. She is very enticing. I’m sure this channel is designed for traveling Americans. Do we really care what the consumer price index is doing in the US? Maybe Daljeet is in London, not Atlanta? I hope for her sake it’s London. Now a story about reptiles reproducing without sex. Reptile sex!?  &nbsp;  Speaking of which, I was accosted by two different doormen at strip clubs down the street. One guy grabbed the arm of my coat. My “back off” was met with a “Fuck You!” I was nervous there for a minute.  &nbsp;  After the maid was finished, I crashed for about five hours to catch up on my sleep. Probably should have gotten up sooner. I may have trouble sleeping tonight. Had a great hot shower and went out onto the street to get provisions.  &nbsp;  I have no idea what I’m going to do next, let alone over the next ten days. I don’t even know what has happened to me. I used to pre-plan everything, was never comfortable just traveling on the fly. I’m not suggesting that I’m “comfortable,” just less anal retentive. Wonder who I will meet up with on this trip?

      5-3-04  17H 40&nbsp;   We’re about six hours into the 7½ hour transatlantic flight back to Canada. We flew over St. John’s, Newfoundland about 45 minutes ago. My neck is hurting from all the strange pillows. So far, though, I’m feeling pretty good. I’ll call little buddy when we land in Montreal. I found a station on Enroute FM that sounds a little like JACK fm. The thought crossed my mind to pitch them on branding it "SkyJack," but that’s probably not a very good idea!  &nbsp;  Editor's Note: This is&nbsp;the final entry from the Grande Paris Journal.

      5-3-04  10H 00&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I found the Maple Leaf lounge! There is one. Too bad I put up with “the hummer” for as long as I did. It’s champagne and barbeques every day, now. Did I mention seeing the new Snoop Dogg show on MTV France this week? “Doggie Fizzle Televizzle” was a scream! It’s a fantastic sketch comedy. I’ve got to look that up when I get home.

      5-3-04  9H 00&nbsp;   Damned croissants! You get the flakes all over you. I’m sitting here at the gate at CDG airport. I checked in way too early as usual! I’ve got a chronic “hummer” sitting behind me. He’s driving me crazy! He was behind me in the café line-up and now he’s followed me to this side of the café, trying to make me crazy with his humming!  &nbsp;  Cecile ordered a taxi for me this morning which was right outside at 7:40am. Check-in and security was super fast. The security people are so lax. The woman didn’t even watch her screen as my bag went through! I must say US and Canadian airport security is far superior. Heidi says that Europeans do it all behind the scenes, the only evidence being the Army guys with machine guns.  &nbsp;  I’m obsessing about gifts again. I’ve got something for Colin, Sweetie, OB, OE, Jeanine, and the girls at work. Do I have something for everyone? Who am I missing? We’ll begin boarding in another 55 minutes. I think I’ll scout out some reading material for the flight. It’s about 7½ hours to Montreal and then another 5 to Vancouver, but somehow the Paris leg is worth over triple the air miles. Que ‘est que fuck!?

      5-2-04  20:55&nbsp;  I got back from Scotland about an hour ago. I’m sitting, waiting, for le derniere meal in Paris. What a whirlwind trip to see Heidi! The bus trip from Beauvais is more like an hour an forty minutes with traffic, and it was not without drama. A woman who spoke English, French, and Spanish got pissed off at the driver when she found out that the bus depot is at Palais de Congres, which is not exactly “downtown” as advertised. She spouted for about five minutes from the front seat, then got on the cell phone and started to yell at the person who was coming to pick her up. She got more and more agitated with every passing moment. The French guy behind her finally asked her to pipe down. “Tu parle forte,” he said. She proceeded to let him have it in Spanish and capped it off with “Voila!” It’s a nice punctuation that I imagine must loosely be translated as, “So there!” He flung a few words back and she hollered at the top of her lungs as she turned around, “I don’t give a fuck what you think!” Well the bus was shocked. Everyone looked at each other and shook their heads. Then the driver intervened with a loud missive which must have been something like “That’s enough. Both of you pipe down. I’m the driver. I’ll pull over and put somebody off!” She simmered down then. I was shocked later in the ride when her little three year old daughter started to chirp up from the seat beside her. Some mother. What a role model! It turns out she had a huge amount of luggage, and judging by the state of the guy that showed up to pack her and her things into a Mercedes, she must be moving in with him, under some duress. Maybe she was pissed that he didn’t drive out to Beauvais to pick her up?  &nbsp;  Ryan Air is a great deal. It’s “no frills” all the way: no seat assignments and no freebies. But they operate from low cost facilities, therefore there’s no big airport to navigate or long taxies before take-off. Both flights arrived 10-20 minutes ahead of schedule. It was well worth it, although it was a bit of a mad dash to get a good seat. I figured out the trick: enter the rear door of the aircraft and take the window seat in the last row. Then someone takes the isle and the rest of the plane fills up from the middle to the back, and you usually end up with nobody taking the middle next to you. I lucked out this way on both flights.  &nbsp;  Heidi rented a car for the weekend and drove out to Prestwick to pick me up. It’s about 25-30 minutes south of Glasgow, about an hour and 20 minutes from Edinburgh. I paid for the gas and bought the lunch and dinner. It was the least I could do. She gave me her bed again! I’m always tempted to ask her to join me, but I think it would be awkward for the friendship. Too bad because she’s looking great and seems really at peace with herself lately.  &nbsp;  We had lunch at the Hard Rock Café in Edinburgh and then stopped for not one but two bottles of Scotch at Cadenhead’s. I had only planned on getting one, but then got a little carried away. This is going to be an expensive trip! Oh well. Last night Heidi and I had dinner at the Bouzie Rouge, It has a new name now, but thankfully the haggis was still on the menu.  &nbsp;  This morning, we got up, checked email, had a coffee and headed back to Prestwick. Heidi insisting on driving. What a doll!  &nbsp;  I do feel really de-stressed and have worked through so many feelings since I’ve been here. I feel like I’m going home to Vancouver with a mission to really kick ass in the business and live, work-out, date, and be social. In other words, work hard and play hard!  &nbsp;  Random Note: I’m enjoying a crème brulee as I write this. I’ve got to kick the dairy when I get home. A woman has just stopped in front of the café window in which I’m sitting, writing. She pulled out an instamatic camera and snapped a picture. I guess the scene was worth capturing. I guess I have fallen in-tune with the Paris vibe. Now my passport will be stamped with one entry and two exits for France in the same week. I’m hooked on stamps!  &nbsp;  It’s so much easier at the borders here, which makes me regret the state of things in North America all the more. I also regret the pictures of torture and humiliation of Iraqi prisoners on the part of the US military which are currently splashed across the front pages of the world papers. Talk about a fucked up situation. The reasons for being there are so murky and so poorly communicated to the troops on the ground. Even they don’t have any perspective. I expect some of them have lost their minds in the midst of the chaos. It is SO Vietnam. Can’t anybody see that? Doesn’t anyone understand human nature?  &nbsp;  I’ve always felt I should have learned more about sociology and psychology. I am a student of human behavior, though, which has served me well in marketing. Anyway, I’m starting to ramble and I’m not even drunk.  &nbsp;  When I got off the bus today and transferred to the Metro, I was smacked in the face by Paris: couples smooching and people engaged in civil conversation.  &nbsp;  A Middle Eastern guy has just left the café with his woman. They are carrying all kinds of household items they obviously bought today in the shops. He was trying to carry it all, refusing her help. He said out loud, “In my Country, the woman cannot carry anything. Can you explain this to her? That’s the problem with this Country. No respect!” Then he left her with the biggest piece - a painting. Not only was she left to carry the painting, but he left her to pay the bill also. Very funny stuff! It’s Sunday night and Paris sure is dead! Just couples out tonight. It was a big weekend with the 10 countries joining the EU yesterday. I think tomorrow is a holiday, as is May 6th, which is VE Day.  &nbsp;  I got an email from T. (from I.) She wants to see my pictures when I get back. We’ll see how things go. I had asked her out and thought I might have mismanaged it. A second chance maybe?  &nbsp;  This may be my last journal entry from Paris. I’ve got a long travel day tomorrow – 15 hours to Vancouver. I checked my Aeroplan points and I’m up to about 65,000 already since last August. That’s what I like to see! That’s another business class ticket just about anywhere in the world. Where to next?

      My Dad is an old skool&nbsp;storyteller. You know, the kind of stories about having to walk twelve miles through the snow to school. I've seen the old school house.&nbsp;It's right next door to where he grew up for gods sake!   Anyway, one of his yarns involves the family being so poor when he was a child that he slept on two kitchen chairs&nbsp;facing each other&nbsp;rather than in a bed. So when he was sick, we was "sick in bed on two chairs."   I'm sick in bed on two chairs this week. Or at least on a overstuffed leather couch! After the Mariner's game on Sunday, I retreated to the hotel where after about a half hour of air-conditioning I started to come down with a sore throat. There goes this week!   So I'm convalescing at home, watching the democratic national convention on TV, and catching up on my expense reports (back to November '03). Exciting, huh?   Too bad I had to cancel a date with T. from I.   Oh yeah...I just remembered it's fireworks night tonight. Bah humbug!

      Maybe it's a metaphor for my life and career lately, but it's been hot as hell here in Vancouver over the past week or so. I don't know why I think of 29-32 degrees Celsius as a heatwave. I guess it comes with the thinning blood of 9 years on the west coast. Good Lord. What if it ever actually  gets   humid  in the "couv?" I've become a wuss!  What a great week! It's been fast, and furious.  On Monday night, I picked up a beautiful painting I bought at Lisa's boyfriend's art showing last Friday night. I own several of his pieces and didn't expect that I'd walk in and fall in love. Fall, I did. However, the joy was temporarily tempered when Rob emailed four words, "What, are you GAY?" after seeing a j-peg I'd sent. Anal retentive as I am, I polled some other art appreciators in the office and elsewhere and quickly confirmed that it's not even something someone could remotely mistake as a "gay" piece...whatever that is. It does have two naked women in it, though!    I got a last minute call from Muffer (Peter) on Tuesday afternoon letting me know he was on his way over from Victoria to conduct some work seminars out on Kingsway. We hung out a couple times during the week, the most fun being Thursday night. After dinner at Havana on commercial Drive, Jeanine, Muffer and I stopped by the The Eldorado beer store for a six of Canterbury and set out for the Cypress mountain lookout. We flew across the second narrows in the Acura just as the sun was setting on another super hot Vancouver summer evening. N.E.R.D on the stereo. Jeanine reclined in the back, dressed in pink - complete with the legendary pink Prada knock-off bag from New York - with an open can of beer, skirt blowing up, her batting it down. We sat on the mountain on a park bench overlooking the city lights, imbibing, enjoying laughs and the warm wind. Damn mosquito bites are driving me crazy!!! It was great to just hang out like teenagers. Jeanine had never met Muffer and I'm glad to report that he lived up to his billing as a ladies man extraordinaire!  The other main event this week, is the emergence of an amazing business opportunity. It seems I've reached another milestone in the journey from employee to entrepreneur. Just as I grow accustomed to the level of risk and comfort with the niche I'm carving out...the ante gets upped. Oh man! Who the hell invented the concept of human development, anyway? Growth hurts. Why can't I just be content hanging out on Mazlow's first rung of the hierarchy pyramid? Yeah. Food and shelter, that would keep me occupied for a while!  Here's a little secret: I overthink everything.  There's a huge danger in taking too long to think, especially in business. I know this new opportunity is something I need to pounce on. My head tells me. My heart tells me. Emotions be damned. They only get in the way of a good thing.  I'm on my way to Seattle tomorrow to see a Mariners game with a friend/business associate. The three hour drive will probably clear my head a little. I'll take the computer and get a little work done Monday before I come back.  I've made Monday night dinner plans with the Ex. She's seeing another doode, that is, the lastest in a short series of suitors since the divorce. I'm trying not to let it bother me. But what can you do? I guess I'm still a little disappointed that we could not find a way to make it work. But, it's been two years...so I better let that go.  There I go obsessing again...  "I want my pain. I need my pain!" - Captain James T. Kirk, Star Trek, NBC, 1967

      The planes are lined up out in the west, coming into YVR, the sun is sinking behind Bowen Island into the Strait of Georgia, and Elton John's "Songs from the West Coast" is chugging along on the hifi.     It's July in Vancouver. This is technically my first blog, although I'm preparing behind the scenes to launch my grande Paris journal, which chronicles my every thought during my spring trip to France. I think I drew more words than breaths while there!  Reading my notes from the trip has been interesting. It's mostly forgotten thoughts and entertaining ramblings (at least mostly entertaining). But, I'll be glad to share my European state of mind in the next day or so.

      Some things are just good.  This past Thursday evening, "my posse" gathered at Spanish Banks beach, about ten minutes from home. We unwound from a long day, laughed, barbecued, drank beer and wine, and some of us even OD'd on Nutella. Needless to say, those of us who arrived in a bad mood, got over it pretty quickly. No names needed. LOL       "Canuck Place"

      You know, birthdays are awesome when you're surrounded by good friends and some family! It makes turning 35 not such a horrible ordeal. And today was a really good day that ended with a dinner at my brother and sister-in-law's home. Their in-laws are in town from Melbourne. So we were all treated to a wonderful Australian-style home cooked meal of lamb, potatoes, and pumpkin. (Because, of course, pumpkin is a vegetable in Oz and  should never  be served as a fruit in a pie or as any dessert!)     The company was great, the food was wonderful, and it felt good to hoe into a birthday cake baked from scratch.    Inevitably the drinking stories started and of course I told the famous story of a 19-year old Little Buddy (Colin) showing up on my doorstep in Halifax at three in the morning loaded to the gills on beer and vodka after a Friday night of carousing DT (downtown). Halifax is a legendary port party city and the drunken shenanigans are legendary. Because I lived right downtown at the time, it was probably a more appetizing idea for His Drunkenness to turn up at my digs than pass out on Province House lawn which is the usual rite of passage for liquored teens.  After ignoring the ringing for about 10 minutes, I finally answered the phone and buzzed the little bugger in. As I stumbled sleepily to the door I could hear him bumping into things as he navigated the hallway. As I opened the door, he steadied himself and boozily, triumphantly announced, "What do you think of your drunk brother?"  What do you think of your drunk brother.  I could have rung his fucking neck. I was working weekend mornings on the air in Halifax radio, with a 5am wake-up and a 6am start. I might have even had a few myself earlier in the night. "Get in here you little Bastard," I ordered. It took about eight steps and then it collapsed on my couch, with one foot under a blanket and one still on the floor, snoring almost instantly.  That's exactly where he was when I left for work just after 5am, and that's exactly where I found him at 12:30 in the afternoon when I got home. Moved not an inch.  "There's only one thing to do," I steamed to myself.  With one quick call, my old roommate and neighbour in the building, Gary, arrived on the scene with his hockey stick in hand. He started poking at Little Buddy with "the stick". "Wake up Champion," he bellowed, "or you're getting the stick. C'mon ya bastard! Git up." Gary is an ex-pat Cape Bretoner who enjoys any opportunity to take the piss out of anyone, especially when the targeted party is at a humourous disadvantage.  The little fella stirred, obviously hung over and hurting from the alcohol antics of the night before. "I got some pea soup for ya buddy," Gary prodded in his best "Bubbles" voice, ten years before Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys was even dreamed up. "I brung a ham bone for you to chew on too."  "Fuck off," Colin moaned, choking back bile.  "C'mon, get up, get up, get up," Gary poked.  And he did. He got up. Sonofabitch got his just dessert for showing up at 3:30 in the morning and waking my ass up out of bed on a work night!       The Culprit (#2) - 12 years later!

      Yesterday, I skinny-dipped in a mountain stream with another guy, then picked wild blackberries and made a pie with him. Oh my gawd...I'm turning gay! Not really...  I set out for G & K's place on the North Shore at about 3pm, determined to get some exercise after a week of sickness and inactivity. G and I set out along Lynn Creek in short order and after about 20 minutes we scrambled down over the bank to the best natural swimming pools ever, right in the creek. I took off my socks and hiking boots and waded in up to my knees, trying to keep my balance on the slippery rocks on the stream bottom. After about three steps my feet went right out from under me. Those goddamn rocks were slippery! I clamoured back up out of the drink, bruised legs and all.  G said, "You won't be shocked if I get naked and jump in will you." "Christ no," I said. No sooner had the words left my lips, there was a flurry of lilly white tuckus and a big splash. "Oh hell," I muttered, and followed suit. OK, I'm not usually the type to just drop trou in public even if it is the middle of the wilderness....let alone in front of another guy (call me a prude)...but I figured you only live once. It figures that I would pick this moment to unbriddle my inhibitions because -and wouldn't you know- I'm up to my goodies in icy cold water and I hear a distant noise. It might have been a gasp. I turned, and standing at an elbow in the river about 400 feet downstream was a group of hikers staring at me - in my full glory. "Screw it," I moaned and took the plunge. The frigid water closed in on my flu-weary chest and I instantly remembered how sick I'd been just a few days earlier. G was like a friggin' seal, already up the creek around the bend and out of sight. I flitted about for 4 or 5 minutes and then dragged my bits and pieces back up on the bank and hussled back into my clothes. The hikers were within earshot now and kept coming. Two dads with babies in backpacks, and a young boy and a pre-teen girl in tow. They were so consumed with navigating the river bed, they paid no attention to me, or G who was now dragging his shivering arse out of the water, aware now of the approaching, inattentive brood. What an invigorating experience!  On the way back, we stopped and picked wild blackberries - enough for a pie. When we got back to G's place he set to work at simultaneously preparing halibut on the barbeque and baking a pie. Needless to say we overindulged in both, including beer, blackberry vodka martinis and red wine. We were in a right state when K came home. Of course she was sober as a judge and G and I were feeling no pain. G stumbled over their antique clock while trying to reach for a light switch, sending it shattering into pieces on the floor. I may have lost my cookies in the middle of the night...it's a long weekend in British Columbia for gawds sakes - nekkid and baking a pie!
