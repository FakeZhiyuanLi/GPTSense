      Yest whole night tummy ache cant sleep well.......now tummy still aching.....just cramps....wierd feelings........woke up...lost temper at my darling again.......sighz.......y always like tis.......she wanting to talk on phone and not bothered abt my need to go toilet seems abit too much for me.........sighz......y cant she grow up and know wat is more important? I simply cannot count the number of times we quarrelled because she wanted to talk on the phone and was unhappy to be pulled away from the phone.......is talking on the phone so important tat nothign else in the world surpuss it? For talking on the phone......she has been late, inconsiderate and&nbsp;I simply cannot compromise and give in to her because if not my whole life would be simply putting a phone to my&nbsp;ear and yaking away.........sighz......sometimes i think she just needs a&nbsp;tele-bf...............&nbsp;        Quote for the day: "Don't waste your life stuck to your phone, use your eyes to see your surroundings too......."

      Yawnz.......awoke tis morning........now I am 24 already.....n one day........well.......seems the older tat i celebrate my birthday, the heavier I feel mentally........somehow life does not seem as carefree as it used to be. When I was 16, I was so happy cause I was going to JC soon.......when I was 18, kind of dreadful cause army soon.........when I was 21, it was the age of maturity n finally I could get the credit cards n make decisions and enter pubs......now suddenly......24...I have accomplished nothing........ &nbsp; Yest moi darlyng made alot of effort to make my birthday a memorable one......thou we had some pricky moments, generally I enjoyed myself alot. Hmmphm I still didnt get everything I want on my birthday.........in anycase *applause* for my darlyng for her effort.....hip hip hooray!!! &nbsp; Oh jsut submitted an online applciation for Maybank debit&nbsp;card. Guess it would be useful for me to use when I go to malaysia. Kk need to prepare, going out with my darling later on. &nbsp;       Quote for the day: One should never find too many cards a problem.

      Ok gd morning, heres my report for the chalet. Well....after alot of fustrations and troubles, we finally arrived at the chalet. Was quite easy, one straight direct bus and we reached there. We happily checked in and we played cheat, checking in early. Well b4 our supposed check in time, we had our bath n "fun" n were ready to go out. Hurray!   Well it was a pretty let down when we discovered we couldnt enter the jackpot because we werent members. Saddening. But well, we found the arcade n although we eventually spent alot of money, we were happy to be able to play alot of things we enjoy. After a while we were exhausted n we went to have an uneventful lunch n back to the room.  Hehehehe back to somemore fun but den tis time my darlyng drank a mini bottle of wine....ooooo she turned so wild n sexy....oooooooo such nice........  n den I was exhausted and wanted to sleep but my darlyng wasnt satisfied n wanted more!!! DEVIL!!!!!!  Splish splish splash splash.....we awoke to heavy thunderstorm outside....it has been raining so frequently everyday......   Argh.....drenched ....my slippers feel so slimy n wet....ar! My darling managed to cheer herself up with a nice waffle...she ar.....always refer waffles to pancakes. . . . Pool!!! . . . My darlyng has learnt relatively well how to play pool!!! Hurray!!! Next time when we go out we can go and play pool!!!  Oh den we went back to room for.....oh yar....somemore fun...sometimes I am amazed at myself? hahahah ego!!! My daarlyng read already sure go eeeeeeeeeee  Well....we ate my cake and den we departed. Overall....I was very happy, my darlyng was an absolute dear and she tried her best to make me happy and I truly enjoyed myself. Thanks dear.

Yesterday I was so tired when i get back that i forgot to update the blog. We celebrated our 4 months together and we had a fantastic dinner thou as usual we couldnt finish the food. My darling had a very happy day shopping away, got herself a pair of pink pants and a tee. Yup Pink pants! Who would have imagine shan shan wearing pink? I also got moiself a pair of slippers! Almost didnt get it, lost my temper again at shan shan taking so long changing.... Guess what? My darlyng and me got same sized feet!!! Wah.......   Well once again i lost my temper tis morning. I realise its not her fault n now i regret flaring up, nvm later i make up to her by being super patient, luving, luvy dovy and attentative....wonder if I would succeed? Today i shall promise myself to be more patient and not lose my temper. Hope I have a wonderful day at the chalet??? Update when i get back!

      Yest I also dunno why.......seems to have suddenly lost it and quarreled very badly with my darlyng.......sorry darlyng......it somehow seems.....i have kept it inside me for so long and I really couldnt take it anymore. I wasnt happy abt things and simply it wasnt fair if i kept quiet but lose my temper frequently........  Y was i so upset? Simply because I felt unappreciated, insecure, controlled n dictated.........  Unappreciated cause she always says I dont love her, I dont care about her......  Insecure cause.......she called out another guys name during.......  Controlled cause she questions every thing I do......  Dictated cause she demands from me so much................  . . . . . . How did the call end.......well we trashed out our differences and our views......hopefully things would get better...........  I love you darlyng..........for ever n ever............

      Sighz.....did not have a gd sleep.......was woken up from my afternoon nap by my darlyng..........she was pissed off abt me not talking to her again.......I cant really understand y she is always so insistent to talk to me? I told her I would talk to her later but she only had very stupid remarks like later I wouldnt be at home....at night I would be too tired to talk to you......if I cant talk to her at the point of time she wants......she gets super pissed off.........and one thing I hate is she getting pissed off at such stupid things.......here I am having my wonderful nap......... 1. Got woken UP.......... 2. Demanded to talk...... 3. Threatened to talk ...... 4. Told tat it is now or never......  If she wana try be difficult? Den fuck off and we can very well have a cold war today.......I aint gona try and give in........she cant expect to get her way everyday..........I had called her when I got home but was told she was asleep......I decided to let her sleep and go get my own nap........and what happened? When she woke up...she simply DEMANDED to talk to me.......  Second thing that is making me so upset?  1. Your gf calls out another guys name when making love to you..... 2. When asked who she wants to have sex with....she says his name..... 3. All this was not said once but many times........  Somehow I feel very sick in the stomach yesterday.......she was being all lovy dovy and only I guess my love prevented me from slapping her on the spot when she said all this......and what was her reply to her behaviour? She was talking nonsense....and I am being childish......  I really wonder.......repetition of answers are not nonsense....nonsense are random acts.......I really question if I did the same thing to her how would she feel? Somehow when we evaluate feelings.......she takes mine for granted......when I realise I have hurt her.....I always try to make up to her........  Does she realise the hurt she has caused me?
