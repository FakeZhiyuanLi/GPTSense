      Sometimes we all get a little overly-emotional. Looking at my last post, I think "do I really want to portray myself as that type of teacher?". No, because i'm really not that cruel. I am, however, frustrated. Monumentally frustrated.  The University is not a service industry. It is not a day-care center. Every semester I have students come to me with comments like "I can't accept my grade", "I have to get a better grade to maintain my scholarship", "your grading is not fair", "but I studied for hours", "I have to pass this class"...etc. Who is responsible for instilling students with a sense of entitlement to get the grade they want or think they deserve? You have to blame the students after a certain point if they are being inappropriate, but there is something larger at work here. What is it?  The professor I work for said something enlightened today. He said at the University level, hard work is assumed, not rewarded.  Sometimes your best is just not good enough.

      I&nbsp;always find it helpful to&nbsp;see the humor in situations that would normally make me homicidal.  Being a graduate student, I am forced to make ends meet by serving as a scapegoat for professors, that is, being a TA. This summer I am teaching and grading for some gen-ed history classes. I, like your average stock clerk or pizza delivery man, do not get paid enough to care about the wants, needs, feelings, etc. of the people who patronize my business.  Now, I have generally taken the hard line against student whining. This summer has been a whole new experience for me though. I have had about 200 students so far. At least 50 of them have complained about their grade in one way or another. Now seriously, if you don't like your grade, you should go home and hang yourself for being such an idiot, not come and bother me about it, right? Well, apparently i'm wrong. I had one student in particular who turned out to be quite a pain-in-the-ass. He's the kind of boy that has probably never had any positive female attention from a woman who is not related to him. He decided that after earning his dismal grade, he would become upset with me about it. Ok, sure kid. It's my fault your a moron. You go ahead and run with that.  Now here's the good part. He went quite far out of his way to contact every other student in the class in order to ask if they had problems with their grades also. Since many people failed, and on top of that there were many D's, he claims he got some affirmative replies. So, essentially he has assembled a gaggle of slack-jawed yokels who can't do well in a lower level history class to complain that my grades were too harsh.  Now far be it from me to mock, but don't you think he should be bitch-slapped?&nbsp; I mean, where did students get the idea that their grades were randomly generated?&nbsp;  Ironically, this child had behaved very inappropriated to the professor as well and I had reported his behavior to the Dean before he "reported mine". So really, there's just nothing he can do. One wonders if this is the highlight of his whole summer, if he really thinks he's "fightin' the man". Well kid, the man won.

      It's so funny. You're searching for something completely benign, academic or pornographic on the Internet and you come across some complete dolt's manifesto. I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me...how many times I ended up on some website for teen angst or the webspace of some poser academic who thinks that because they have a Masters, they might actually have something to say about the world (and without fail, these people always have a Masters in Business).  So i'm adding to the problem.
