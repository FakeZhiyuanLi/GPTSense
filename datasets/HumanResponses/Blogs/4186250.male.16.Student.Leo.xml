         It is a truth universally acknowledged that there comes a time, post 1 am, when sleep is impossible. This tends to be due, mainly, to the fact that said sleep would not end until sometime the next afternoon. One is unwilling to waste an entire day, obviously, having stayed up very late in order to relish the previous one to the very last. Consequently, one decides to actually stay up all night, and take the opportunity to watch the sunrise, go for an early run, under cover of v. early morning light (running out of doors under any other circumstances unimaginable), and most intriguingly, discover precisely what is aired on television in this strange, in-betweeny world that is 3.30 in the morning. Have vague suspicions that all BBC presenters throw caution to the wind and become incredibly chatty, abandoning the news to frank discussions of their sex lives. This would, doubtless, make life slightly more bearable for the poor insomniacs.     In any case, it is 3.30, I do have time to fill, and from such circumstance flows forth this literary tidbit. Too late, I yesterday realised how deeply I must have confuddled my readers with a post title that bore no relationship to the actual contents, promising a discussions on why, though life is a party, I am, metaphorically speaking, not quite there, being bathed, dressed, and probably just about to set off, but plagued with last minute doubts about whether I really want to go after all. Ironically, these neurotic self-doubts spring from the fact that I don't get invited to many parties. Whether this is because I'm a shoulder-bag toting, vegetarian classicist I don't know, but it would be nice to be able to blame the fact that I live in a village devoid of scope for parties, save for those of the boring dinner kind, the population of St. Bees being comprised almost entirely of elderly pensioners and middle-aged, middle class contractors from the nuclear plant.    In any case, having decided it's unfair to confuse with titles, I must get straight to the point of this one - that even if ones darkest days, when the cat has been sick on the kitchen floor and there's nobody about to clean it up but you, when everyone else seems to be abroad and you're getting vacational thrills from watching Sky Travelshop, a little bit of concern about you from your fellow man will cheer you right up.    For example, as a light pick-me-up, photo taking is nice. Being told to scooch into frame and be in someone's photo implies an actual desire to have a photographic record of your appearance. It's encouraging. Even more encouraging is this:    The other day, my friend Jen called. I promised you more about her (or at least, I think I did), and a little more you shall certainly have.    Jen is quite possibly the loveliest person ever. Failing that, she at least has lovely hair - knee, if not ankle length, fiery red locks which can be, and have been, put to practical use. She's been very ill over the past few years, with ME (an abbreviation of a disease whose long and complex name is "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis"). This basically means that she gets incredibly tired. It's therefore no mean feat that she's managing a multitude of very hard G.C.S.E's and A-levels, not to mention having me as a friend.    In any case, the phone rang, early evening, and thanks to the miracles of caller ID, and recognised Jen's number and picked up the phone with a cheery "Hey, Jen!" (as, bad news excepted, Jen's mother or younger brother would be somewhat unlikely to call me). I heard, almost immediately, the breathless, and, quite frankly, weird ripost, "Oh thank goodness, you're not dead." Gratifying as this was, I was by no means unconfused, and it took several minutes of telephonic shouting until I comprehended that there was a direct connection between the sound of ambulance sirens heard a few hours earlier as we set off from the village shopping, and a radio announcement concerning the drowning of two boys at St. Bees beach. Hearing that one of the two brothers concerned was dead and the other critically hospitalised, Jen reasoned that as I both was and had a brother, and lived at St. Bees, a direct connection between that radio announcement and my own mortality was not impossible. Clearly, my somewhat over-sheerful answering of the phone quashed all of my dear friend's anxious doubts - she surmised that this was the voice of someone who was neither dead nor seriously ill in a hospital intensive care ward. Now, I feel a good deal of sympathy towards the family of the boys concerned, who are, apparently, local, but not too much so, living in the slightly larger town of Whitehaven, three miles north, but I cannot help but feel slightly flattered, and warm and snug inside, that somebody would actually care enough about the state of my cadaver (i.e - whether or not I was one), to check on my vitality. Of course, I don't doubt that my immediate family harbour just such sentiments - however, they being, good, solid, emotionally repressed Northern folk, we have an unspoken agreement that such affairs remain just that. In any case, with a vague variation on the traditional pout -  "Somebody loves me, they don't hate me, think I'll go for a run."

        The party is beginning (but I'm not there) -      With thanks to Verdi for title inspiration.    So here we are. On the cusp of my sixteenth birthday, young, male, provincial, and, quite frankly, somewhat bored. A state which is something of a prerequisite, I'm sure, for taking the time to set one of these fun emotion-pad things up.    Beginning, however, is slightly more difficult than first anticipated, so I begin with -    La Vie de Moi -          I, Solus Ad Victimam, aged fifteen years and eleven months, am the eldest child of three of an ordinary, British, lower middle class nuclear family, being born on the 17th August, 1988. I am the possessor of two younger siblings - a brother, thirteen, and a sister, eleven (ages approximate), a mother (recently emancipated and employed, a nurse in training), and a father, a project manager at our oh-so friendly nuclear power and waste reprocessing plant. We are, you see, a nuclear family in more ways than one.    I am also soon to be the possessor of a set of G.C.S.E grades, which will leave me either delighted or deflated (and at the mercy of parents who are not angry, but "disappointed").    I live with my family, plus one large, overweight, pedigree, yellow eyed white persian named Arthur (and until recently, a transexual cockatiel [more on this later] and a psychotic hamster [this too]), not to mention four lemon goldfish (not lemon), named after the four horsemen on the apocalypse. They have a castle, presumably containing all manner of aquatic horrors.    But getting back to "ma vie", as opposed to "les vies des mes peches", I have a room in an end terrace, three story, late Victorian villa, with original fireplaces, ceramic rayburn, sauna and gym. That is, in more cosmopolitan terms, equivalent roughly to a Barrat home in Croydon or a colonial centreplan in New Jersey. I am fairly well travelled, but not quite well enough, and a day pupil at my local public (private, oxymoronically) school.    I'm a Christian, a pianist, of sorts, a novice writer, and a metrosexual, as I am assured by more than one well meaning urban friend - a straight guy, well read, in touch with his emotions and this year's fashions. Not too sure about the fashion part, my idea of chic being fascist black, brandless cotton concealing most of my body (woefully neglected in favour of intellectual pursuits - must start using treadmill while reading), but complimentary, anyway. At least until told that David Beckham epitomises this new, model breed of man. Eww.    But here's the rub. My parents, clearly misconstruing my A-level choices (English, French, Latin and History), seem to have glorious mental images of self, bold, London barrister, defending the rights of the down at heel. Clearly, this is sentimentalist bollocks, not to mention counter productive - law is not something I am going to enter into. I'm not sure, quite yet, what I am going to do (possibly some civil service post requiring frequent travelling? Hmmm), but thus far, teaching, the Church, and journalism have all been rejected. Clearly, my petit bourgeois parents are not to be dissuaded from dreams of a son at the bar.    As the lovely Jen (best friend - more about her later), says - "it's your life". By which I mean, it's my life. Ma vie. La vie de moi.    Ergo, it is my right to choose a career I enjoy, considering the amount of time one will spend on that career. But, apparently not.    A conundrum, of which, if you are at all interested, I shall keep you informed. but here, dear readers, it is almost one in the morning, and this daylight savings (?) Cinderella needs his sleep. And so, farewell - more will come on the life of this teenager soon. but don't feel you have to return. I'm not arsed.    The bright day is done, and we are for the dark. Au revoir.
