       Few remember,few forget....others try to.My memory started registering from a very young age.So I was blessed,maybe,to see the world from a 4 year old's eyes.Life was my first teacher,the second was time,the third & present is experience.                       I have seen faces that have morphed with a dexterity that was amazing aspect in that age of a toddler.People can be parasites,they adapt,flourish & multiply....sapping the essence of anyone who happens to block their path motionally,physically or emotionally.                       Memories can be a strain or maybe a pain at times.Some scenes are to be cherished others give you a cold chill in the back of your spine that gives you a dry throat & palpitating heart. Iam not a writer but I can feel emotions of those around me to almost a physical level.

      for all those who love their bosses A guy phones up his Boss, but gets the bosses' wife instead. "I'm afraid he died last week." she explains. The next day the man calls again and asks for the boss. "I told you" the wife replies, "he died last  week."  The next day he calls again and once more asks  to  speak to his boss.   By this time the wife is getting upset and  shouts,  "I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU TWICE, MY HUSBAND, YOUR  BOSS,  DIED LAST WEEK! WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING?"  "Coz," he replied laughing, "I just love hearing  it.

      Hey parvez hi r doing man For all others let me introduce myself iam raghav from pune. To be or not to be sounds interesting . I want to share something i read somewhere. How to make your life count then .Here is the way   People always feel that they gonna live forever !!! but the fact is You may never know when you will die!!! today can be ur last day, so are u prepared for it.? so what i mean to say once the man feels this ,that the every body is not going to live long ,he tries to make the life more meaningfull and concentrates on the things that really mean to him.so do this  think that there is a bird that comes daily and perches on your shoulder and asks you "IS TODAY UR LAST DAY".This thought would make you more concentrated on your things to do in life it reminds you to make more of the day that is ahead.Follow this i will tell you you will be happy.Bye keep posting

      I am using citibank credit card.. have limit upto 80k as of now.. but the fuckup is they never send the bill when the billiing cycle gets over and that means we have to pay a fine of 250 + 4%interest on the money that we have used up in the credit card..we have to call them up and ask them wht is the amt i have used up each time etc..so many hidden charges also in it... icici bank is even better..u never knw y they have charged u at all no explanations ..they simply charge u under all kinds of categories as far as i have hrd..standard charted is suppose to be the best but the fuckup is u need to pay 3k per yr as charges

      Few years back I met this girl, who I would never understand. Well today her words make sense but she is not there. Like u cannot see anything that’s in the same dimension or any dimension that’s higher than u. If you say u cannot understand what some one else says then u r in the same dimension or in lower dimension, than him.  Some day his words will make sense and so will mine and yours also   But the one that makes sense, later in time, is in higher dimension   Please note your words do make sense to me. Rest you guys can guess   Fuck this dimension think, Guys post on what u feel like   Hey ambala how about posting u r photo along with the car u purchased   A guy who ever has permission to blog to this account will get a free gmail invite from google. Once u log into the blogger account try roaming u r eyes in the whole page and locate a word called gmail   Assi I look forward to see more from you and all the rest of us   Enjoy Madi  BABA

      Ahem errr...emotions are not abstract its subjective...u knw wht emotions u have towards a person..it changes with time and circumstances..(just like abstract class in JAVA) not believing in abstract metaphysical theory indicates that the person has sound logical and sense of questioning things and not go by flimsy theories which do not have a sound logical base... All of us knw that the "truth is out there"..so y jump the gun ...we knw just 5%..we knw that we dnt knw anther 10%..wht we dnt knw is that we dnt knw abt the stuff we dnt knw is 85% ;)... Mind is not a stallion which u can control neither is it strong ..its like a monkey with no strength and direction..its how the individual utilizes it makes all the difference... ..Harish

                    Critics are well wishers in disguise           Hey Hash everything meta begins from something abstract...coz even emotions are abstract! Few run away from what they feel is true coz they want to believe it otherwise and hoodwink themselves.But truth is something like an air packet under a water body...itz gonna come up and burst your bubble. Chitter chatter thats all you may asuume and write off my fragment of meta....Lemme wish "Let your belief save you". Did I go off my rockers? Well mind is a wild stallion racing against the wind...it takes paths unassumed.Do hop in & pen your tracks Hash & the rest of you folkz out there...     -Diablo-

      well some words of advice for Diablo and BABA ..man u guys talk so meta physical ..its so hysterically rubbish ... its more like u guys talking on a topic like "PHYSICS OF SCIENCE" even though its crazy u can just bluff abt it and make it sound sensible ..LOL hehehe ..dnt take it personally  Assi can be a  good writer..he shldnt waste his talent..

      ......A PORTAL is created for everyone to commune & share their vibes...alas mortals are always tied to a materialistic bondage....commitments & expectations pull them apart from what they are destined to commit & act....for itz only after death they realize their chance has slipped...& all they have got is eternity to atone their sins....do remember life is brief but after death lies the real test!

      U know Diablo every person has a aura (I mean the one that is seen around the head of great people)  Now only children see this aura and when u grow up will not be able to see it. There are many techniques to again learn how to see aura (I wont go into it) Now the aura will be good and to look only if u r a good person and have not done any sins and if u r bad person u r aura becomes bad a terrifying with increase in sins So u might have seen small children cry when they see some people and smile sometimes and neutral some other times and that says how is u r aura  U know Diablo some time children cry when they see me(just joking) Guess we can change name. U Baba me Diablo   This weekend sucked big time. It rained whole week and we could not go out and nerdy (mudgal) gave hath after raising hope, to top it all   Some times I sit by the window and gaze at the rain, no though pass me.strange i have become numb   Hay gouds is have used this PDF thing I used iText api/jar, its a song to use it, but it takes time for comlex pdf

          Life is indeed a funny musical chair competition....the music keeps ringing in your ears ripping your tender ear membranes....for a few,Lady Luck smiles & they get a seat...others keep running in the dark...banging their heads..bruising their bodies..wrecking their confidences...they just keep running hoping that the music is going to stop the next instant! Alas mortals are blessed only with that...HOPE!     -Diablo-

             Babies find my face funny..          Every time I get the privilege to go coochie coo a small baby am the one who gets butterflies in my stomach soon as I get into  the scope of his/her vision....There is a half baked burp & a sudden gumless smile do find babies cute,adorable & yes,  extremely huggable.Adorable is fine with me...But why do they laugh when they see my face? Most of my pals say its actually a gift to make someone laugh,but babies..Its hard to digest for me.Maybe they are a more intelligent class than what they subtly portray might say it reflects on my insecurity or whatever...But its not a particular baby...Its the whole clan.                   Making a beautiful gal laugh,cheering up a sad pal...That's all o.k,I presume..but what makes them laugh? It really do haunts me....Its like an itch where you cant reach..Am still wondering what impairment in me tickles them off?

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY Guys!!  Sometime since my last post here. I just met Kumkum and Johncie (I dunno how many of you remember, but they helped a great deal with Mnemosyne(now, do you remember that??)) last week. Besides that, life is very boring; what with Baba sending my own forwards back to me and only calling to ask about the cash I owe him!

       "Life seems to be a drag....same old faces...same old routine...resulting in the month end with a healthy ATM account..." Thats what my pal who's working in Techno Park told me.I wonder..is it the same with you guys out there? Are you people sucked into the monotony of the dread word routine...or are you going with the same vigour that used to pull you to the morning classes in MIT? Do chip in your mind faucets into this blog cabin & let me know pals..

      A friend sent me this forward last night. Thought I'd post it instead of emailing it out to all my twenty something friends. I wish I could take credit for writing this but I can't... so I won't. Kudos to the anonymous author who read my thoughts and so eloquently put to words what I couldn't.  **looking forward to my 30s...I hear it gets better, especially when you feel more secure about yourself, and less accomodating to bullshit. "Being Twenty-Something" They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you. You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward. You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person. One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender! What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out......  GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US!!!!!

      Ok here goes, first I post my snap on the blog and all shout that, I have slimmed down or rather try/pretend to. Well guys this came as a surprise I am trying to loose weight but then, I had no idea, I have lost noticeable amount. Gee thanks  I am trying to patofy this girl who is thin rather should I say slim (don’t worry be happy she has right dimension, at the right places). I am loosing weight to match her up.  Me getting her looks distant but I never say die.   Ah you Mr. Kaushik Bekal you are getting wisdom and its corresponding teeth now. Me got both, long time back. Dude you know what I have been the principal of the school you studied in. HE HE HA HA   Looks like Delhi is a nice place. But any ways BANGLORE is better at least when it comes to bird watching.  Hey guys do you know this fact Please read on  #################################################################### An Eyeful a day keeps the doctor away* by JONATHAN HAYTER Staring at women's breasts is good for men's health and makes them live longer, a new survey reveals. Researchers have discovered that a 10-minute ogle at women's breasts is as healthy as a half-an-hour in the gym. A five-year study of 200 men found that those who enjoyed a longing look a busty beauties had lower blood pressure, less heart disease and slower pulse-rates compared to those who did not get their daily eyeful. Dr. Karen Weatherby, who carried out the German study, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine: "Just 10 minutes of staring at the charms of a well endowed female is roughly equivalent to a 30-minute aerobics workout. Sexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation. There is no question that gazing at breasts makes men healthier. Our study indicates that engaging in this activity a few minutes daily cuts the risk of a stroke and heart attack in half. We believe that by doing so consistently, the average man can extend his life four to five years. She added that sexy stars like Dolly Parton, Heather Locklear and Demi Moore had proved to be especially good for the men's health. #############################################################  Happy bird watching. Looks like gouda is going to leave for long now (burdening Earth for long time)   YA you Assi what the fuck are doing in manipal searching some obscured information on Egypt mummies and fuel for train GO BACK AND STUDY AND DON’T COME BACK TILL THE EXAMS ARE OVER  Where the fuckin hell on earth do you get time, patience, interest, martial, energy for all this. Dude save it all for the exams and GOOD LUCK.    Our Roshan Rao is shi these days should I say lot. He got lot of flowers for his birthday. Oh well from the fairer sex. But he would not let me click a snap with him and the flowers together. Not only that he is shy from posting to the blog also but is a regular reader though.   ALWAYS  BABA

      Chums do read this exercept I got when surfing the net-->  "A small item in the September 27, 1859, edition of the Syracuse Daily Standard reads: “Egypt has 300 miles of railroad. On the first locomotive run, mummies were used as fuel, making a hot fire. The supply of mummies is said to be inexhaustible, and are used by the cord.” Dard Hunter’s Papermaking cites an informant’s report that “during a ten-year period the locomotives of Egypt made use of no other fuel than that furnished by the well-wrapped, compact mummies.”   My italics. To repeat; for 10 years they used nothing but mummies as fuel for the railroad!
