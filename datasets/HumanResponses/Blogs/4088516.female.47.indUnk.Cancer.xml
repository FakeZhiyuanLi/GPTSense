      This is the last day of summer, we start monsoon season usually in August. Means lots of humidity, hardly any will hit the ground, and we could use it. We still have lots to finish up since building the addtion on our house. Got to get a well house up before it gets to cold. Working out in the yard in August and September is not pleasant when it's so humid. Reminds me of when I was a kid and spent my summers in Louisiana with an Aunt, working in her potatoe fields. We almost have the skirting finished, maybe by next weekend we'll be done. Then we have to paint.  I've got to trim back my grape vine, it went hog wild this year. Thought I would get some grapes this year. But on one of my daily walkarounds, I noticed that the stems were there but the grapes were not? Birds? Snakes? What? I know nothing about grapes, guess I'll learn. Oh well, there is always next year. My roses did really well this year though. Hopefully next year I'll have figs too! We want to plant some more trees next spring. I want to plant some veggies and herbs as well. So much I want to do, and so little time. Why do I need sleep?  Also one of our few nieghbors has called John 4 times in the last 2 weeks to come over &amp; kill a rattle snake, all 4 had at least 12 buttons on the tail. Must be a den somewhere. We plan on walking the area tomorrow to look for it. Everyone out here has dogs and other pets, our Georgie got bit by one last fall. He still has 2 patches of no fur on him. I'm just glad he didn't die. At the beginning of spring we had a large Bull snake living under the house, I wonder if she/he's still here, as they do not like rattlers.

      There is a first time for everything and this is my first time for blogging, so what shall I say? Life is good! I named this  The Storey House  because my husband (John) and I live here with Joan Storey (John's mother), and 3 cats, Baby, George, and Gracie and 3 dogs, Sony, Little Girl, and Methos. We live in the desert of New Mexico. We have a small oasis that we enjoy calling home.

      at least all of our animals thought so. John and I thought it was pretty cool, it was mostly lightening.  Big bowl of it, sitting right on top of us last night. We shut down all the computers, unplugged everything, turned off the lights and enjoyed the light show playing outside, it was wonderful. Then it rain real good most of the night.  I really like living way out here , away from everyone and everything.  When I got up at 6:30 and plugged my computer in, the secondary harddrive started making this klacking noise, had to disconnect it from the motherboard. It was causing my computer to reboot, wasn't loading windows, just restarting over and over again. But I got it fixed or I wouldn't be updating my blog. I think computers are cool, I'm always learning something. And there is always something worth seeing or hearing on the www.  Well back to work in the yard, I'll write more later.

      just how bad spam has gotten. One of my neighbors asked if I could come and see what was up with her computer. She just got it back from the shop where she had them remove 10,000 pieces of spam (thats what she called it), when I got there yesterday afternoon there were 8244 more e-mails. The shop also install Norton Anti-Virus for her, but not a firewall. So I got her a free for home use Zone Alarm installed and running. She has had her computer since 2000, without these, I'm amazed she only had alot of SPAM.  I go through my husbands computer, on a network to connect to the internet & I still have a firewall  and anti-virus running, even though he has them too. I spend alot of time keeping my computer hidden from everyone else on the internet. It's like my personel stuff, I've only had 1 virus on my computer in 4 years. I've had my home page highjacked 3 times, and I don't like it. I like knowing what is or is not running on my computer.
