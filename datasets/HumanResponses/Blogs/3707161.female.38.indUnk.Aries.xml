      I still haven't figured out how to add pictures...I guess I could try downloading the programme "Hello" again and see. Last time it wouldn't recognize my user name and password.   I should go and paint my bathroom now that I have the paint. Jamaica Bay...Home Depot Behr paint....hehe!....it's a nice aqua/jade colour. Better get cracking then.   Oh, um, I am not on Zoloft anymore. It reduced me to an emotionally numb blob of a zombie. Doc agreed that it was perhaps not the most adequate anti-depressant for me at this time. So, guess what? We're trying another, called Effexor-XR. Gradually building up to the dose so that I don't have any of the unpleasant side effects. Been taking that for about 12 days or so now. I have saved an interesting article about the dangers of taking SSRIs to read when I am able to concentrate fully...not easy right now with Natasha here playing at my feet getting into the CDs and pulling them all out! Grrr! She should be napping but her teeth are making her miserable right now.

           -------&gt; 03/23/04 11:32      I guess I must be feeling a little more positive as I posted this message on my group's page today! (Dynamic Moms, http://groups.msn.com/DynamicMoms)      I don't FEEL better physically.... but perhaps it is the mental change that will happen first and the physical will follow? I still have to visit Lisa Hansen and her new baby, Amelia...I wanted to see Amy (keep putting that off!) and I also need to get to the gym!! When it comes down to it, I just procrastinate and blow it off until the next day.....and the next....and it never happens! We're invited over to Becky and Erik's on Thursday night (6 p.m.) and I don't think we've got anyone available to help us move.... they have something on the 23rd of April....damn!        Thursday, 01 April, 2004       Well i haven't written for a while and thought i had better get cracking!   The damn noise here is annoying as hell - they're replacing the shingles on the roof.... and have been since i dunno last week. I have been extremely lazy and it's hard to determine whether it's part of what is going on or if it's just plain old laziness! Jeremy's home and the sun is shining - i think he wants us to go some place.....   Sunday, 04 April, 2004   Ok, I should mention that I am not writing this as regularly as i had promised myself. Just more proof of my lack of willpower! i have noticed an improvement in my skin and a subtle change in my general mood....subtle...but nonetheless there. i wonder if Jeremy has noticed? The weather getting warmer and more sunshine might be a factor? But i wouldn't know, as I still don't go out a great deal. i worry about Natasha getting vitamin D deficiency! Rickets or whatever it's called.......I'm still taking the pills but have caught myself forgetting at times and quickly popping a pill! Wonder what the consequences of that would be if i were to forget one dose?    We're starting to pack for the move later this month! i still have reservations about the general neighborhood and hope &amp; pray that this will be the right choice for us. If not, I said to Jeremy yesterday that we'd have to sell the house within the year! Ha! He said "Nope I see us staying there for 7 years!" ...Yeah I highly doubt that!    Monday, 05 April, 2004   Well now, i am not getting any further with my procrastination problem am i? It's 15.27 and I am still not showered. Jeremy will be home in a minute to get his college stuff and i am still dirty and unkempt....I feel so guilty at times. Dishes in the sink all dirty too...Natasha is happily playing right now beside me. Ok in the SHOWER!!!!!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Thursday, 08 April, 2004   So that was a very short entry on Monday! Since then the week has gone by slowly with me doing nothing much different...the usual: procrastinating about everything from the dishes to my ASL homework! Today and yesterday I had and still have a headache that I'm pretty sure is hormonal (just finished my period). Not pleasant but not a big deal either really. I napped a little today when Natasha did so that was around 1.30 p.m. I still feel groggy all day long and have little energy. What am I going to do when it becomes very urgent to pack and get ready to move!? I do feel a  little  excited or rather ANXIOUS about our house move! Such a big step...moving to Savage where we know nothing except Jeremy's cousin Nicki. I feel that i have been having dreams of a slightly erotic or sexual nature - hoping that that means my libido is coming back! Awakening again!    Tuesday, 13 April, 2004   So here i am again...this journal really isn't serving its purpose is it? I mean I hardly document anything. Well I think I have seen my energy levels increase a little. I had Esin come and visit with Arman yesterday and was able to tidy up and wash dishes without feeling tired! She left not long after Jeremy got home so maybe 5 pm. It was nice to see her...There is going to be a lot going on for which i will need energy! Tomorrow I have a lot of ASL to catch up on and on Thursday I have Jerry, Nicki and kids coming to dinner at 6. Before that I have to meet Jeremy to go look at the house one more time and in the morning i have to go see Dr. Short for a follow-up appointment....going to be a busy few days. Closing on the house on Friday and then at the week-end I guess we'll be painting! this is not supposed to be a journal where i narrate the days events - it's supposed to be where i speak about emotions and changes i feel on a daily basis.   Ok, i still feel kind of blah every day. Nothing really excites me or makes me laugh. I don't feel sad really nor do I feel ecstatic. I have felt a little happiness creeping up on me and wondered if it was my emotions starting to sort themselves out. Jeremy said something that was pretty cool in that when we were having sex (on Sunday early afternoon), he felt that I was more responsive than i had been in a long time....although of course he was too excited to take my needs into consideration....I can't blame him as sexual encounters are very few and far between these days and he cannot be expected to hold off and go on for ages!! I did like it though and felt peaceful and content afterwards. We took a shower together, as Natasha was asleep! All in all, I felt happy. I guess if one were to count then I'd say we have sex maybe once or twice a month these days! That is the least i think i have ever had living with a man! I cannot force myself to feel desire! i'm very glad that Jeremy is not the sort of person to force me either! He waits patiently! That will probably ultimately pay off for him in the long run even though it is very hard on him now! He also said that I had seemed generally happier!      Wednesday, 28 April, 2004     Ok so now we are officially in our new house! This is just so exciting and hard to believe! Will we be able to afford living here? My God the mortgage is so high! $1620 or something each month! If we didn't have Jeremy's VA check to live on this would be impossible to do. We have to thank our lucky stars....   I don't feel too bad these days, still tired but not to the point where I don't want to do a thing! I love our house and look forward to decorating it. I have ideas....whether they will look good is another matter! I'm going to have to sign off here anyway as the ASL test is today on 3 units and I have no idea where the hell my books are! Gotta go and shower too while Natasha is napping.    Saturday, 01 May, 2004   Busy day today...bought a much-needed lawn mower and other stuff. Dresses and stuff for Natasha! I forgot to take my happy pill...remembered when it was the evening. I have just finished my period. Had no PMS or anything except those damn headaches as always! Started way too early (Sat. Apr 24th)...wonder why I am not regular these days? Have to get the picture rail for Natasha's bedroom. Feel tired, got to go shower and get to bed. Too tired to write now.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Wednesday, 05 May, 2004   ASL exam day - the final....I  still  haven't studied. Why do I have this procrastination issue?? Christ! It annoys me but I don't do anything about it!    Feeling tired still but not too bad. My period started early this month (April 24th and is still ongoing...a yucky brownish sludge 12 days later!?? Why?) I am clueless as to what is going on with my bodily functions. Oh, mum and Julie called yesterday. Julie to find out about my lump in my left breast (which is fine) and Mum to say she had sent over a birthday present for Natasha. I don't know why she doesn't send stuff to the others too?! They receive parcels ok....maybe I should ask her to send something. Steph and Jeremy still are not talking (I think) and Steph sent me an invitation to her Mother's Day BBQ on Sunday. It did not include Jeremy's name so I asked her in a return Thank You card if he was automatically invited and that we would be in contact as soon as she clarified that. Hmmm! I am so proud of Jeremy and how he finally told her what he thought of her! Good for him. At least it wasn't ME the baddie this time! Hahaha!    My weight is still an issue. I went down to 134 lbs. the other day. Yesterday when I weighed myself I was 136. I hope not to go any lower!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Tuesday, 11 May, 2004   Today the doc called me at home about the ultrasound results (left breast). She said that there was apparently no real cause for concern and that we'd review in 3 months and perhaps do another one. I also discussed my Zoloft prescription and she said to go ahead and pick up the new prescription for 100 mg. So we've increased the dosage...as I don't really feel that anything new is going on...kind of "plateau-ing" right now. Natasha is well thank God and I still hope that the medicine is not harming her. Trying to wean but only half-heartedly. Still haven't unpacked everything either...last ASL class tomorrow. I'm sad. We'll go out to eat at Applebee's to have a farewell dinner type thing!   Friday, 14 May, 2004    Natasha took 3 steps yesterday!!!!!!! Whooooohooooo!    We are so happy she is beginning to walk...Jeremy's a little apprehensive though. I was not as moved as I thought I'd be. I'm much less teary-eyed than I normally am...that's weird...I'm usually very sensitive but this medication seems to have dulled that emotional over-reactive ability...Taking 100 mg now and the headaches I had for about 2 days were not very nice! I also have a stinking cold so of course I felt lousy!    I got an A for my college class ASL! I was thrilled and relieved! (Considering I did not study for the last 2 exams at all!) We had a nice meal (9 of us) at Applebee's in Inver Grove Heights. We were finished at around 8 or so and all hugged the teacher Karen Jerzak when we left. Awww I was sad but perhaps we can have her over for dinner. She said to invite her in the Summer time as I guess she has a lot of work right now. Jeremy will be 31 on Sunday. I hope those 2 presents are going to get here on time! Still have to buy a card.    05/20/04 17:36   Well, I feel a bit weird today...kind of like a headache lurking in the background but no actual headache. I have been taking 100 mg of Zoloft and I notice it makes me feel a bit woozy a couple of hours later. I don't know if that is possible. And I have forgotten it maybe 2 days (but not in a row). Strange...   I have not been to the Inver Hills home page to try to log in and check my grades for ASL like Stephanie Gates advised. I have now and I don't know my user ID...just great! I'll have to call the college tomorrow as they are closed.    Friday, 28 May, 2004   Ok it's been a long time since I wrote and I feel that this is probably a waste of time writing this anyway. I mean what purpose is it serving? I'm not really talking about my feelings and the way I think this Zoloft is affecting me....it's been more of a journal of daily events really! I find that I often seem to forget to take my medicine. I just cannot recall if I have taken it or not. My memory is no better it would appear! Ha! It used to be so good...Jeremy has just painted my 2 Adirondack chairs white so that now i can go ahead and paint a second coat when it's dry. I also have to strip the cabinet but getting it down to the bloody porch area is a pain as it's so heavy! Well I have invited people to come over and "celebrate" Natasha's 1st birthday next Thursday and I don't know who will show up (other than family members). I'm happy she is doing well. Her teeth are coming in strangely too though. One of her molars has pierced (upper left) but she still hasn't got her bottom tooth next to the 3 others she has! I finally got the kitchen painted! Whoohoo! Happy about that and we love the colour! It isn't quite finished, as I wanted to make a Celtic border as a sort of backsplash to liven it up a little.    Tuesday, 08 June, 2004   Natasha is 1 year old now since June 3rd.... We had chocolate cake and ice cream for her and some friends and family over. It was nice. She got some nice gifts too! She is walking more now too. Doc was pleased with her progress when we went on the 4th. She is so tall and still quite heavy! 33.5" and 25.5 lbs. or was it 26? Can't recall. Gotta go see Dr. Short today and tell her how like a zombie i am feeling on this Zoloft. I don't think it is doing any good. Natasha sleeping through the night now most nights is helping a little though - getting more sleep. Better go as she needs to take a nap and I need to get into the shower!   Tuesday, 22 June, 2004   Ok I have decided to post my journal to my new Blog! This is a big thing for me as all my dirty dark secrets will be out for all to read! Yikes! Who f*cking cares anyway?   I re-read it and I seem obssessed about taking SHOWERS!! Christ! (Yes I've had one today!) I shall get all this online, choose a font and stick with it from now on as it's definitely all a mish-mash of stuff right now

        I should continue this online - post it here. Well here it is......         Ok this is the beginning of this possibly long process of getting better.... I was diagnosed with depression on March 10th this year and although i was upset to hear that that was the opinion of Dr. Short, i was also pretty relieved...It has possibly been there for years without my really acknowledging i needed to get some treatment. yeah i know that back in 1998, September/October timeframe, i was diagnosed with "stress depression" and took Cipramil for about 2 weeks but that had no effect because i wasn't able to take it long enough. I know why that was but i don't need to rehash all that here.    i feel pretty ashamed about having depression and wonder how it will affect my self-esteem now. i feel 'tainted' and not really a proper normal person....i suppose no one has to know really do they? Well, certainly not my family!   Although i haven't yet started any medication and i am still awaiting blood test results, i am thinking that i will probably accept the medication she suggests...even though I'm still breast-feeding Natasha. I am looking forward to feeling better. My body just seems to be breaking down bit by bit.  Let me see, what is it I have noticed over the months since she was born?  Well I was feeling more energetic at the 3 mth mark than i am feeling right now so that to me is an indication that i am not doing well. I'm sooooo bone tired and have non-existent energy levels. The fact that i had felt a lump in my left breast (which now seems to have gone way) a few months ago made me think of cancer and i thought perhaps that i was losing my energy due to some terrible cancer spreading through my body yet not really believing it to be a remote possibility, hence the reason (one of) i never sent to get it checked out. Also the fact that we didn't have insurance set up made me have to wait whether i liked it or not....i was too scared to go to the doctor anyhow.    18 March, 2004   Well this morning i popped the pill....50 mg of ZOLOFT.....actually no, i only took half (25mg) just like Joe, the Fairview Eagan pharmacist suggested and a few hours later i felt light-headed and very drowsy. I have since had a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a cup of coffee....feel a little better.....BUT i have belly ache (lower belly, like period pains) today. Earlier it was quite painful and i was dreading having to take care of Natasha as i could hear her awaking from her nap...    i feel the same weariness and lack of energy. Keep telling myself that i have to clean the flat and finish the laundry...can't seem to get into gear. Oops #2 brewing...brb....oh that was a lot of poo! anyway, the funny thing is with my symptoms, my periods are still regular and i am not constipated at all! regular there too?! weird! i dunno....i don't feel right at all. i know that this is something i must do, take this medicine, in order to try to get better. i was thinking about how   bad   of a mother i was to my 4 kids and how i was always too tired to do anything much with them.....i realize that this was depression even back then....and i find myself repeating the same patterns with Natasha who of course does not deserve to have a depressed mother! Neither did Yashar, Vanessa, Danesh &amp; Ashleigh for that matter! But what help could i get in Burundi? i want to be a better mum all round and for her to be able to say that she had a happy mum and a well-rounded happy childhood! Jeremy is a good father, he balances out the days where i hardly speak to her or play.....i feel so guilty. I'm sort of hoping that this Zoloft will be a  miracle cure  and that I'll be a 'new' me soon! Is it unrealistic to expect that in a few months I'll be happier and balanced and feeling optimistic about life??? I'll be 38 in a few days.... March 28th...just around the corner. Will i be able to look back and say, "well that was a dark period in my life, i wish i had gotten help sooner as now i am such a happy person, grateful for everything i have!" ?? Will i? i mean i am grateful. Jeremy is the best husband any woman could ask for.....Not perfect but  so  good for me. He is not to blame for any of my actions...but of course he is suffering the consequences of my depression. I'm not the wife he expected I'm sure! Natasha is healthy and cute. Not the prettiest of children but cute nonetheless. I hope she is not going to be affected by this medicine....   Anyway, to be able to feel joy and laugh more and appreciate things more, feel emotions properly NOT just sadness, anxiety, worry, fear, anger and worthlessness would be a 180 degree turnaround for me! I'm so used to being in this mind set that perhaps i don't realize any more that my thinking is so negative?! I feel so phony when i am trying to laugh and participate in conversations and pretend to be up beat and on-the-ball when I'm not is such an effort...   Monday, 22 March, 2004   It's 5.30 PM now and today wasn't a wonderfully exciting day but I did feel a little more energetic, enough to crawl around the breakfast bar and play "Boo!" with Natasha! (She loved it). I ate breakfast and lunch and had some fruit (shared my pear with her). So I am trying to eat more regularly so I don't get low blood sugar....I am still addicted to the PC....I just have to check my email an answer posts in Dynamic Moms. It's on all day. When the weather improves I will have to make an effort to get out....and leave the PC alone! I typed all that without looking at the keyboard btw....I know where the keys are mostly! WOW! I'm impressed! I still feel that I have a long way to go before I feel a lot more optimistic and actually FEEL again. Jeremy was trying to get some nookie last night but I just pulled away....no real reason.....I just knew I didn't want to take it any further! I know it must hurt his feelings and I feel bad. I also realize that when I started this journal I did not answer one of the questions I asked myself: .  Let me see, what is it I have noticed over the months since she was born?  Ok.... Increasing tiredness and a feeling of absolutely NO ENERGY at all.... drained from morning 'til night and sleep does not alleviate it....aches in my lower back and especially my right hip bone - on the top of the pelvic area of the hip bone. That has never improved as Natasha just gets heavier as time goes on of course! Insomnia at times.....just a feeling that i am running on nervous energy and cannot sleep. Of course I am so tired so it's a vicious circle. Appetite has decreased drastically - food does not taste the same. The hunger sensation is there but I cannot seem to EAT as much as I did only a few months ago! I have realized that my libido just disappeared very gradually over the 9 mths since she was born. I had more desire when she was 3 - 4 mths old than I have now!!! I feel angry at times, like I used to back in the early days in Buja.....Outbursts of anger. I have 'daymares' where I graphically think about accidents happening to Natasha, either inflicted by me or just her falling say off the balcony....and stuff about the kids too that is just as gory and horrific. When she cries for any length of time for reasons I judge unnecessary I feel the anger and stress well up inside me to the point where I have to put her in her crib and walk away for a while...do the dishes and drown out the noise. I wonder if sometimes she did this because she was reacting to my stress and exhaustion? Weird. It is a possibility though I suppose like Jeremy suggested one day! She does this less and less though I hasten to add.... But the night waking still annoys me sometimes so much. She doesn't sleep regularly through the night yet. My hair has gone lank and limp, falling out a lot. It looks and feels horrible. I have constant skin breakouts and I look wan and tired! My skin is the worst it has been in years I think! I also feel weak, losing weight, STILL! I am 143 lbs...ok lemme check that.....144 fully clothed today. Ok I had to make a long pause there. What time is it now? 20.44.....Jeremy will be home from college soon.

      Why is that as we age, time seems to speed up? Of course it doesn't...but it sure feels like it does! My sister called from England today. She sounds a lot happier since she has been looking into this Reiki Healing stuff! Keeps urging me to explore my psychic tendencies....yeah yeah....if I did so, how on earth would I be able to distinguish the charlatans from the real thing if I joined a "psychic circle"???

      So it's about half past midnight and I can feel that I am 100% wide awake.....to my total consternation! Aunt Flo is responsible for this. Every time she's in town I get wired up to the point where my mind just won't let me relax. Or is it a full moon tonight perhaps? Dunno...too lazy to open the blinds and check. Ah well. Recently I discovered a lot more about Blogs in Time Magazine (to which I am subscribed) and astonished my usually well-informed husband by telling him about the phenomenon - an unknown subject to him until yesterday! I am going to have to learn a lot and fast! I want to make my blogs interesting, albeit prevent my inquisitive family from discovering my blog(s) so I can really open up and be totally honest. There are likely to be topics that would shock the pants off them and would no doubt alienate me from them forever! (Not my husband, from whom I keep no secrets, well...except my Depression Journal which he'll be allowed to read one day!) Where was I? I still have to find out how to post pictures...and update my profile or should I say,  complete  my profile. I really don't know where to start...are people going to read this or is it private? Should I divulge a lot...or a little? Hmmmmm. Got some pondering to do.

       Well, I am saddened to learn today that Jeremy's cousin Jerry and wife Shannon have had their baby girl (Riley) but she's been diagnosed with "Shone's Syndrome" which badly affects the left heart chamber....ventricles....whatever. The prognosis (when you read about it online) does not sound good at all. My heart goes out to them and I wrote Aunt Judy an email to tell her to please let them know that we are thinking of them at this time.    Babysat Arman this afternoon. The hours seemed to whizz by....then before I knew it Marc was here to pick him up!    Got to get the third coat of red paint on the cabinet. It's outside and it's gonna rain tomorrow I think so have to get it finished asap!

       urlLink http://web.tickle.com  Oh it worked this time! The link is in...well this site has some interestingly serious tests and also some not-so-serious ones to do to entertain oneself when one is bored! I did the Inkblot Test and the IQ test. I was surprised with both results! My subconscious mind apparently seems to be driven by  PEACE  and I have respect for mankind. Who would've thought that of lil' ol' me? I also seem to be an  insightful linguist  too according to the results of the IQ test... On another note,  I chatted a little with Yashar this afternoon and was pleased as always to see that he is fine! Half the family is in Belgium (but hey, that half can shrivel up and die for all I care!), Vanessa is in Cape Town (with friends) and he's going to hunt in the bush tomorrow...  Danesh and Ashleigh get to stay at home with their father out working all day so basically they look after themselves. God I hope they'll be ok. Here, on a chilly Summer's day in MN, I have just got over a nasty nasty headache and Natasha seems to be waking up from her nap. I must've been sleep deprived these past 2 nights seeing as I feel so shitty! Natasha had some virus again or perhaps she is just teething those "incisors"....? Hungry now....Jeremy is out at Cardinal Stritch tonight til late. I miss him but at least now it's down to once a week that he's gone (instead of 3 nights). He no doubt called the VA guy about the call he got re Voc. Rehab. which, if he could get, would be another godsend. Went ahead and ordered that leather sofa + 2 chairs set didn't we? So we're in a little debt here now.
