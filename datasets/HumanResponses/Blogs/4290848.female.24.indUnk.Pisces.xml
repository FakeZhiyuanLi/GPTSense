      I have been watching her sit on her fluffy yellow beach towel since noon today.  Every few minutes, she flips the pages of her fashion magazine with her slender fingers that have been dipped in sparkly pink polish.  She tosses her  curly auburn hair and lets it fall in cascades like gentle hands caressing her bare skin.  I whistle a familiar tune in hope that she will turn in my direction.  It's a lost effort; she is too absorbed in the knowledgeable words of her magazine.   Moments later, she rises, running her fingers through and down her hair, searching for invisible tangles.  She lifts her sunglasses to the top of her head and scans the beach with eyes that I have yet to see.  Noticing something in the distance, she abruptly walks off towards it, her hair floating behind her.  Wait!  Where is she going?  I jump up, my feet cursing the fiery sand.  I shuffle along and notice the trickle of sweat trailing a path down the back of her leg.  How I long to see her face!  I notice the washrooms down a path ahead of us and decide that they are where she must be headed to.  I perch myself on a bench, like an anxious baby bird waiting in anticipation of what it knows will eventually return.  I watch her struggle slightly with the door of the women's restroom.   "AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!"  A terrifying scream emerges from the depths of the washroom.  "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!"  Seconds later, another scream echoes.  I fly up from the bench and race towards the wailing screams.  What is happening to her?  I have to save her.  I reach the door of the washroom and fling it open.  The sight that greets me is now what I expected.  She is standing at the mirror, her face almost pressed against the glass and her fingers poking madly at her chin.  "What are you doing?" I ask in fascination.  She swivels her perfect hips and glares into my eyes.  "I have a zit!" she blurts out.

      I am on my whopping 6 days of holidays!  Whoo hoo!  It is better than nothing though.  I was supposed to take 10 days off in Sept. but my work 'needs me' so they said to take this week off instead....although my 10 days somehow turned to 6.  The weather has not been the greatest so my big plans of going to the PNE and aquarium and all that might be out the window, although no matter what I will get to the PNE.  I spent yesterday babysitting my friend's daughter so today I need to do something fun.  One of the days I need to tackle the hurricane that ran through my house.  I honestly think the hurricane from FL visited my place from the looks of it.   Speaking of FL, I was planning on going there in Sept but I decided not to spend money that I don't have.  I think I will take the monkey to Go Bananas today and let her run around and I will work on some of my letters that I need to get answered.  Having as many pen-pals as I do is very rewarding but trying to keep up can be hard sometimes.

      There is a terrorist living in my house.  He peers around corners with beady yellow eyes that glow in the dark, hands outstretched and ready for action.  He watches for any sign of movement from his prey.  All at once he lets out a scream then makes a mad dash and  swipes with sharp swords.  He clings on and swings back and forth as his mighty prey shakes in the wind.  He twirls around madly until there is nothing left but a few tangly threads of skin.  This little monster is a kitten and his prey is my curtains.   I made the mistake of falling in love with another cat.  Actually, to be honest, it wasn't me, it was my daughter.   He purred and meowed and looked at us with soft blue eyes that begged 'Take me home'.   He was barely six weeks old, just a ball of static orange fuzz and pointy ears.  I think there must be Siamese behind those ears from the way they look, although he certainly didn't inherit any intelligence to go along with them.  I decided this would be Emily's cat and not mine as I already had two.  She named him 'Kitty' and took on the job of feeding him 'cookies' (cat treats) and brushing him (not always with the proper brush....eek).  At first he was cute.  He would fall asleep anywhere and was especially fond of sleeping beside his new best friend.  He soon discovered that toddlers make great partners in crime.  They would lie on the floor together and talk in their secret language then suddenly there would be silence.  I'd hear a crash and then a splash...and there the two of them were in the toilet bowl!  One day they decided to see if cats  really do have nine lives, and so Kitty took a plunge from the second storey window into the bushes below.  A daily adventure occurs when I open the front door of our apartment.  Kitty goes racing out and down the hallway as fast as he can and Emily follows behind laughing in delight and yelling 'Bad Kitty!'.   Another time, Kitty 'accidently' went for a walk with us in the stroller to the store.   I just try to keep in mind though that in a month I will get my revenge.  Kitty will be paying a visit to the vet and be coming home much more domesticated and less of a testosterone fuiled wildcat.

       I discovered something today and I think it made me realize what becoming a mother has done to me. It has put the smile back on my face. If I want to be silly and goofy in the middle of a busy restaurant and have everyone staring at me like I am crazy because I am making fingerpuppets out of empty creamers then so be it. I get to see that sweet smile on my little girl`s face, see the eight little teeth,and see the gap between the two top ones that is identical to mine. I get to hear the giggle that sounds exactly like a toy doll...only more magical because this doll is very real and very alive. We can spend hours outside splashing in puddles and I don`t care if we get wet and dirty...that is what the bathtub is for. I can watch in awe as she finds the perfect leaf, carries it around with her back and forth along the sidewalk,then without hesitation offer her most prized possesion of the hour to another child that toddles by. I get to proudly hang on the fridge the first picture she has coloured by herself. It has mostly swiggles and dots of red and blue but to me it is the best art I have ever seen and I will keep it always. We can sit in the bathtub and line all the rubber duckies up in a row then knock them into the water to see who makes the biggest splash. We can wear empty margarine containers like hats on our heads and play peek-a-boo behind the washcloth. I can read the same book over and over to her, the one with the baby farm animals. I get to make all the animal sounds and she finds this hilarious. She tries to copy me but to her every animal is a puppy or a kitty and makes the sound `woof woof`. I get to watch as she curls up on my chest,tiny hands clutching my hair like a security blanket, just like she did the first night we had together. Her lips slightly parted and she snores like a kitten...almost a purr. I get to smile again and know that this is a love that is forever.  Jan. 26, 2004

      I thought I would give this blogging thing a try and see how it goes since it has been a long time since I kept a journal and keeping an open one like this should be interesting!
