      This blog is the place for me to rant and complain and de-stress over my senior year of high school. I needed a dedicated spot to keep track of grades, deadlines, SAT scores, who accepted me and who didn't, and so on, and I felt a new blog over here would be great.  Just for some background info, my name is Amanda and I'm a senior at Coventry High School. I'm a band geek. I have a 3.7 GPA and rank 101 out of a class of 439. I'm a member of National Honor Society, Rhode Island Honor Society, and Spanish National Honor Society. I like to write, draw, and compose.

      I tell ya, they say the SAT is easier than the PSAT. And then they say the ACT and SAT are different enough that you can excel at one if you suck at the other. Man, I hope that's all true...    I took the PSAT last October and scored a 186 -- 62 verbal, 56 math, and 68 writing, or something along those lines. Anyway, I was in the top 20 percent and qualified for National Merit Scholarship, and I'll hear back from them in September. I was projected to get, therefore, no less than 620 verbal and 560 math, and in fact, the PSAT people scaled it up to about 1220 because the SAT is supposed to be easier than the PSAT.    I've taken 2 practice SATs. The results have been less than 1220. In my own defense, I rushed one just to see how I do at the pace I always take tests, and I got an 800 total (part of my problem is I never actually read passages, I skim them). I took the other at 3am in a sugar buzz and got a 900 (again, I am a passage-skimmer). The least I can say is that they ARE going up, right?! I have two more practice tests out of my SAT book, and if they increase by 100 each time, I can get an 1100 on the last one, and maybe a 1200 on the real SAT!    Still, I'm curious about how I'd perform on the ACT.    I do want to take the SAT at least twice this year, and if I'm not satisfied, I'll take the ACT once. I pretty much have to take the AP Psych exam 'cause I'll be taking AP Psych, and it's like, "Ahh, what the hell?" I might also take the AP Spanish Language exam, and maybe AP Chem, 'cause my Chem I teacher said an AP Chem class would cover what my school covers in both Chem I and II, and I'm taking Chem II this year. And if I can brush up on my music history, I might go for the AP Music Theory exam. Except I suck at sight-singing.    Like I always say, we shall see.
