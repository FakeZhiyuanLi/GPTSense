       I don't mean to judge, (ya, right! This statement is only ever made by those who  do  wish to judge but don't want others to judge them) but (see!) I had a little lunch with a marginally annoying friend who was so absolutely rude during the lunch that it took all of my strength not to smack her and send her to her room.  It's not that she had 2 beers during a lunch that was less than one hour when she has to drive back to the office. That's a whole different rant that's far more serious and important than my actual rant, which is trivial and more in line with my overall nature.  She took not one, but  5  phonecalls during our 45 minute lunch!!!!! I abhore mobile phones in general (it's an aversion stemming from my previous life as a PM when I had one surgically attached to my hip by my company), and believe that in particular they have no place in:  restaurants golf courses movie theaters cars anywhere where they might annoy me I don't like hearing a mobile go off in any of these places, let alone be  with  the person who's rude enough to be the cause of the interruption! Holy shmoly!  Arthur, as you may or may not know is a Financial Planner. When he goes golfing with his colleagues (which is often, don't kid yourself), if anyone takes or makes a call on the course, the other members of the party take the phone and throw it in the water hazard. I should have dunked the mobile in her soy latte, but I don't think it would have had the same impact.  Whew. That's better. I'm done now

       I have not written anything in my novel for a mind-boggingly long time. I'm pretty sure I'm avoiding it by writing in this blog (which I might like better, though it won't pay me royalties...). Also, I've been painfully obsessed with getting my house and yard ready for a pending family reunion we're hosting, and that's taking up a goodly chunck of time (gotta love the word  goodly , and don't underestimate the satisfaction derived from saying the word  chunck ).  So - in fits and starts, I think I'll start writing bits of the novel via the blog. Thus killing two literary birds in one fowl (heh heh) swoop.  Here's the beginning:   My coffee tastes like piss. It is truly abhorent, and I momentarly wonder if someone hasn't  actually  pissed in the pot. I know it happens. I remember seeing it on one of those overly dramatic news magazine shows. You know the ones - "Scandals Caught On Tape!". I wouldn't put it past some of the developers - they're still pretty miffed about all their stock options going to rot. I know how they feel - I've got a couple thousand that are never going to be worth anything, but you don't see me squatting over the brewing machine.   That's enough for now - I really have to get back to work. Hmmm, I don't know that I'll post a lot of the novel - Arthur thinks someone will pinch it. But, with only maybe 5 people reading the blog, I doubt that I have anything to worry about.

       While watching the riveting coverage of the  urlLink Canadian Federal Election  last night Frankie Mouse slit his wrist.  No - it's not nearly as interesting as it sounds. He was "helping" his father build the deck out back and cut his arm with a chisel while trying to carve his initials in a piece of spare lumber. I took him to the emergency room (where there were 3 other boys his age - all with "boy type" injuries - skateboard mishaps, basketball net-building misadventures, and one with a large piece of wood in his foot (it was big enough that you wouldn't call it a splinter)) and he got two stitches.  When we got home he immediately called all his friends and cousins to let them know all the grotesque details. Good god! It never occurred to me how different boys are from girls. I'm going to go play Barbies with Benjy Mouse - I can at least relate to that!

       For the record, I've only told Carmi and Arthur (my husband) about this blog - but I've had 30+ views on my profile. Not a lot, but about 28+ more than I expected.  Hmmm. You people could leave me some comments or something...

       I'm a little miffed. I just noticed that a post I made yesterday didn't show up. I'm sure it was a user-error, but what a pain. It was very link-intensive.  I'll give you the short linkless version because I don't feel like doing the whole thing over again.  On Sunday, I bribed Frankie Mouse into making the 4KM hike to our local video store to drop off some DVDs by promising him he could rent a GameCube game. When we got there, I realized I'd forgotten my bank card. I thought he was going to cry! So, when we got back home, we got in the car and went back, bank card in hand! Very pathetic.  I tried to force Frankie and Benjy to ride the 3KM to the library on Monday, but it was raining, so we drove. Yesterday, we didn't go anywhere because we had to bake 1 milliion cupcakes (well, it felt like that many) for Frankie's last day of class. We had some leftovers, so Benjy took them to daycare.  I can assure you that the original post was much more interesting, with links to the games and movies we chose, as well as our library selections. This is the Reader's Digest Abridged Version - it lacks the detail, but contains the meat. Maybe nobody really cares what I think about  urlLink Sliding Doors  anyway...

       I accidentally dropped a pat of butter in my coffee this morning. My last coffee - no beans left. I seriously considered fishing the butter out and drinking it anyway. I didn't, but I really thought about it. Yuck. Does that make me a gross person?

       As you may, or may not know, there's a federal election in Canada on June 28th. I have no idea who I'm voting for since all of the parties suck hugely. Having said that, I've made it my busniess to understand the platforms of the three main parties ( urlLink Conservative ,  urlLink Liberal , and  urlLink NDP ) as well as the  urlLink Green Party , who've been able to run candidates in every riding across Canada.  I will eventually come to a decision (I've narrowed it down to  not the Conservatives ), and it will be based on my research and my gut feelings. Apparently a family friend is basing her decision solely on the party's name. Since she thinks she's conservative, she's voting for them. She has no idea about their policies, who is running in her riding, or what the other parties' policies are. It's pathetic. I asked her if she agreed with Stephan Harper's (leader of Conservatives) anti-Kyoto, anti-gay rights, pro-Iraq involvement stance, and she said that they didn't affect her, so she didn't care.  Nice .  What makes it even worse is that she's otherwise a very nice person - she's just apathetic and uninformed.  So - what's my point? My point is that if you can't be bothered to at least find out what the candidates stand for, then you shouldn't be able to cast a vote on June 28th. She doesn't get it. I'd rather have a well informed prisoner vote than an uninformed civilian.  Maybe if I'd explained that it would be akin to blindly voting for someone on  urlLink  Canadian Idol   without ever having watched the show she would have understood.

       Another great weekend. My house is clean, I exercised, I shopped, and I ate (a lot). We had a great Father's Day - Benjy and Frankie mice made nice gifts for Arthur and we also bought him a new golf bag and some sandals (to replace his 8 year-old Nike's (phew!).  And, dum dum da dum...I wrote a couple of pages this weekend! Excellent. My biggest problem is that I'm really motivated to start new chapters, and get about 3 pages into them, before I lose interest. Then, I wait a few days and start another chapter. I lack even one finished chapter. It's a disgrace, but I'm willing to bet that I'm not the only one who writes like that. The good news is that I have the entire plot in my head (it might be better on paper, I know), so I can jump around from chapter to chapter, but wouldn't it be nice if I  finished  one? Who knows? Do you know?  Alas, I'm in an excellent mood. I fear that such a great mood will lead to a lack of productivity in the novel arena - as most of my inspiration for it comes from a sense of panic, stress, and doom. (Not that my current job inspires those feelings (at least most of the time), but it's easier for me to recall Project Management events when I'm in a state of learned helplessness, which I'm currently not). Perhaps I'll have to invent some stress.... healthy!

       I haven't posted for a while. It's been crazy busy at work (I'm supposed to be creating a new product series for our publication) and yada, yada, yada, I've been playing a lot of  urlLink typer shark  in my spare time instead of writing. No excuse, I know.  I've got lots of great amunition for the book, however, based on the crazy week I've had, so that's the good news.  Also - I saw a deer crossing the road on the way to work today. It was pretty cool because it didn't run across, it just sort of sauntered slowly, stopping to smell a strategically placed chip of tar, and then scampered off into some trees.  I plan to play with my writer's blocks tonight, though. Promise.

       I was talking to Arthur (my husband) this morning about the novel-in-progress, and his major concern is how many pages I think it's going to be. I have to laugh a little - as my feeling on this is that it will be as long as it needs to be. But, of course, he's pragmatic, and thinks that a solid 200 - 300 pages is the ideal number. He thinks that a book about this long would be more appealing to publishers than if it was longer or shorter. I think it doesn't matter, but maybe I'm an idealist?  What do you think? Is there a magic number? Arthur may be right, based on what  urlLink this  reveiwer had to say.

       Well, the weekend's pretty much over. It was a good one - no regrets.   Frankie Mouse and I read a few more chapters from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy tonight. We've made it as far as Chapter 6 of Life, The Universe, And Everything, but I thnk it's time to stop. He's only 9 and while he's been really keen on reading it up to now, I know that the rest of this particular book is going to go way over his head. Most of the story has anyway, I will admit, but he's really liked the parts that he "got", like the Cirus Cybernetics Corporation's drink machine's mantra, "Share and Enjoy!" He says it everytime he gets a drink from the fridge.  Also - I have to admit that I've really liked that we have inside jokes now about "42" and "Eddies in the space-time contiuum" and my personal favorite, "Let's meet the meat". Anyway - I'd like to go out on a high note, so I think we'll move on to something more age-appropriate like Harry Potter, and go back to Hitchhiker's when he's a bit older.  Also - for the record, all the times I've read HGGTTG I've never noticed the swearing. It's not foul, but there are a few "hells" and "shits" that come up. Live and learn., I suppose.

       So - I promised that I'd tell you more about my novel-in-progress, and have as yet, not done so. In my past life (before I became an IT writer) I was a project manager for a small software company devoid of business ethics - I did that for five years until the stress of it chased me into my current lower-paying but slightly more fulfilling job of writing about IT, (rather than worrying about IT).  Well, then - my novel is about the escapades of a project manager for a morally-bankrupt software company. Obviously I'm drawing on a lot of my own experiences, plus stuff that my friends and colleagues have lived through. It's hard not to have friends and colleagues in IT - everyone's in IT. That reminds me of a quote from Douglas Adams (my hero):   I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies: 1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. 2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things. Douglas Adams (1952 - 2001), The Salmon of Doubt, p. 95   Therefore - being as IT took off while me and my friends were 15 to 35, we all have careers in it. Lovely. As far as I can tell, none of them really  enjoys  working in IT, but I think the real issue here is that none of them enjoys working, period. Who can blame them. Which is why I really want to kick this novel writing in to high gear, perhaps make a comfortable living on it, and work from home, where I meet the children as they get off the school bus, and walk off into the sunset...  Seriously, though, I like writing, especially when it's not about picking the right antispam product for your enterprise, and I'd like to do it for a living. Obviously, if I had the choice, I'd rather if someone just gave me money every week and I didn't have to do anything, but there doesn't seem to be many openings for those positions. Maybe I'm looking on the wrong job board...

       Do you ever have so much work that you don't know where to start and you end up doing nothing? Yeah? Me too. That's the day I'm having now. I was highly productive this morning, but this afternoon is going to the dogs. I'm thinking around 3 I'm going to see if the beer fridge has been stocked yet. Yes - that's right, our company supplies beer to it's employees on Fridays. Sweet! I'd tell you more, but you'd be jealous...  Anyway - at our company meeting on Tuesday, we were asked to write down on a slip of paper something we want to work on doing to "better" ourselves - it doesn't have to do with work. They were all posted in our games room. Some of them are good. The sales people all put lame things down like more dials, and one of the VPs said he is going to try to not read his email when people are talking to him (nice). I said that I'd try to be more patient - i.e not yell at other drivers, not thump my mouse when my PC freezes, let my son take his time when he's telling a story (even if it doesn't make sense) and let my 4 yr old daughter brush her own hair. It hasn't gone terribly well so far, but I did let a couple of drivers in when it was highly inconvenient for me to do so.  I'm working on it....

       I had a  very  long offsite meeting at the CEO's house yesterday with my manager and the marketing director to "brainstorm" the product/promotion/placement/price of the product line I've been writing for the company. I would have liked to have said "Don't know, don't care" but I need my paycheque, so that's a big no there.  Anyway - I was so mentally exhausted by the time I stumbled home, played with the kiddies and put them to bed that I didn't write a single line. Hubbie and I were going to partake in a cheap bottle of Gamay Noir, but it was skunky when we opened it, so I had to settle for rum and cranberry juice. Poor substitution.  BTW - have you checked out the trailer for "Farenheit 9/11" yet?? No? You've gotta:  urlLink Here it is   Talk at you later!

       Here I go into the brave new world of blogging. I've been an avid reader of other people's blogs and thought it time to start my own.  I'm currently writing my first ever novel (more details later, obviously). It's a struggle. Baby steps, as it were. It's all good and will happen eventually. My goal is to have a first draft completed by 2005(ish). I know nothing about hiring an editor or the publication process, though. I'll be researching that and will post my findings here.  I don't really know if anyone will be interested in this blog, but for now, it will be for my own satisfaction and enjoyment. Let the chips fall where they may.  Cheers!

       Are you a tp innie or outie? I'm an outie. That means that when I replace the toilet paper roll, I have it roll from the top and hang over the front.  My best friend is an innie. She has the tp roll from the back.  I don't do that because I don't think it should touch the wall. She does it because she thinks it looks tidier.  For the past 8 years, we've always switched each other's tp around when we're at each other's houses. Yes, I recognize how infantile that is. Yes, I'm going to keep doing it.  There is an entire  urlLink pro  and  urlLink con    urlLink argument  out there on the web - and it's pretty divided. How do you hang your tp?

I wrote him a note (do adolecents still do that?) and mentioned this squirrel that was wearing trousers (you've seen them! In the spring, when they're not done shedding) and this guy, this ASSHOLE (boys are so stupid) focused on the fact that I had misspelled the word squirrel and wrote me a three-page note in which he mocked my spelling of the word! I was so humiliated. He didn't get it when I broke up with him, either. Stupid, stupid boys. (Oh, except you, Arthur).

       As a woman, I can't help but admire Keanu Reeves, not because he's a good actor (which, obviously he isn't), but because he's so darn lovely. I do admit, however, that once I watched Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, I cannot picture him as anyone other than Ted Theodore Logan. So, I've come to think of every movie he's in (or at least every one that I've seen) as a new adventure for Ted.

       First of all, 10 points to whoever can place the origin of this post title.  Second, something strange is going on at the  big city  library today. I went there to get  urlLink  The Salmon of Doubt   - the last book by  urlLink Douglas Adams . The library apparently had two copies. Imagine my surprise when I found that not only were those books not there, but there were  no   urlLink DNA  books on the shelves at all! Not in hard cover, not in large print, not in paperback, and not in the books on tape section.  Clearly, I thought, something is amiss. I asked the librarians, helpful souls that they are, and they gave me that patronizing, motherly look that says "You poor troglodyte, let me enlighten you." Until they got to the shelves and realized that I. Was. Right.  Since the almighty system showed that the books were in, I can only assume that some selfish patron was collapsing under the weight of carrying all those  urlLink Douglas Adams  books in their arms somewhere within the confines of the library. I considered hunting them down, but then realized I didn't have enough time, as I had to get back to the office. People need me here.  Yeah.      I settled for an early novel by  urlLink John Irving  - a good writer, albeit, but obviously a bit more weighty in his topics of choice than good old DNA.  This is certainly a mystery for the ages. OK, not the ages, but certainly for the week. I think I'll pop in tomorrow and see if they've found out where the stuff went. My daughter thinks that when you put books in the return chute, they go to another world. Maybe she's right.

       Curse the internet! I make my living from researching stuff off the internet, but curse it! It's making me a  urlLink hypochondriac .  &nbsp;  Frankie Mouse has been doing some weird stuff with his eyes this week. For no apparent reason he opens his eyes really wide, looks up, then opens his mouth really wide. He does this about every&nbsp;1/2 hour&nbsp;or so. We asked him why, and he says it's because his lower eyes are "sticking" and he has to open them.  &nbsp;  He's going to see the eye doctor on Friday, but of course, I had to check things out on some health sites. Clearly he has  urlLink Tourettes &nbsp;and not allergies or an eye infection as I had earlier thought. Hmmmm.

       As a former little person, I know I would hate it if my mother ever wrote about my social life on her blog (and I would be confused as well,&nbsp;because the Internet, much less blogging, did not exist when I was a little person), but as a mother, I find it all very cute and quite within my sphere of rights to air his laundry to the world for my amusement.  Frankie Mouse (aka my 8-year old son) is having a major battle of wits with this nasty little girl in his karate class. They hate each other. Can't be in the same room together, in fact. Obviously, they're in love - or at least in the kind of love where you push the girl you like into a snow bank.  Chloe&nbsp;is home-schooled and quite well-spoken. Frankie announced that "his feet were killing him" one day and she replied "I hope they succeed." If I were her mother, I'd be really impressed with her quick wit. As Frankie's mother, I'm officially appalled. Frankie is a smart kid, but he's not quick with the come-backs (he's like George Kastanza - he thinks&nbsp;of a great reply much too late). He's been rehearsing, though, and now his standard reply is, "Whatever, doll!" which infuriates her to no end.  Yesterday, though, he crossed the line. As soon as everyone was in formation on the dojo, Frankie put up his hand and proclaimed, "I have an announcement!" The dojo quieted, "Chole annoys me." He went on to say that even though she's mean and nasty, he feels sorry for her because she doesn't have any friends, whereas he has lots....He was cut off by Sensei before he got any further.  (In my parental defense, I wasn't there when this went down - I heard about it later, and he's been grounded).   Needless to say, Sensei spent a better part of the class lecturing the two of them on the seven principles of the black belt and how they're not living by them. They've been warned and threatened to be civil or risk being thrown out. Ahhh, love...  In other news, Benjy Mouse (aka my 4-year old daughter) announced that both Curtis and Katie (at day care) want to marry her. She hasn't made a decision, but thinks it would be better to marry a boy. I agree, but I don't want to pigeon-hole her. I also pointed out that I didn't meet  my  husband until Senior year of university, so she might want to give it some time.  Parenting in the new millenium is such a treat.

       Not the happiest morning today.&nbsp;   I like to listen to books on tape on my way to work - it's a long drive and it passes the time nicely. I would listen to books on CD, but the  hick-town  library to which I am a slave has not progressed to CD's as of yet. I think they're just getting rid of their record collection&nbsp;(yes, that's right  vinyl ), so I shouldn't expect too much.&nbsp;  Anyhoo, I was on the last side of the last tape of  urlLink  The World Below   when all of a sudden it just ended mid-paragraph. I looked for another tape, rewound and fast forwarded the tape a few times and came to the conclusion that there must be more tapes that are not in the box. But, there are only 4 cassette-holding spots in the box, and it says very clearly on the catalog information that there are 4 cassettes in all.&nbsp;  I work in a  big city . So, I&nbsp;checked the  big-city  library's online catalog this morning - there are supposed to be 6 cassettes (unless the one I had was abridged and this other one is full-length, but then&nbsp;that's some really pathetic abridgment to end mid-paragraph without any wrapping up or closure, and really, not making sense at all....). My conclusion is that they've always been missing these other cassettes, and the library just doesn't know it.&nbsp;  Now, I wasn't the first person to get out these tapes - there are about 8 earlier&nbsp;due date stamps before mine on the library check-out sticker (yes, my library has not progressed to the computer receipt thing yet - like I said, it's  hick-town ). This, of course, begs the question - why didn't anybody else notice???? Or did they notice and just not say anything? Or did they tell the library staff, and they didn't check into the issue?&nbsp;  To top things off, once I'd admitted defeat on my hour-trek to work,&nbsp;I decided to pop the first tape of another book in. Guess what? It starts mid-tape. I've tried rewinding it and fast forwarding it, but it won't budge. I was thinking that maybe there was something wrong with my cassette player, but alas, no - that's not it. I'm fairly angry now.&nbsp;  I decided to check out the 6 tape version of the book at lunch from the  big-city  library, but then Arthur called. He was in town and finished with an appointment early, so would I like to go to lunch? How could I turn down lunch with Arthur?&nbsp;I hate to be so uncynical, but really - I love meeting him for lunch.&nbsp;  So - off we went, and now I don't have time to go to the library. I will try to go tomorrow. In the mean time, the suspense is killing me (ok, not really, but I don't like listening to the radio when I drive). I wonder if I'll bother telling the library staff about the books on tape, or if I'll just throw them in the return chute.  &nbsp;   [Sigh]

       Went through the  urlLink Tim Horton 's drive thru today and got a still-warm chocolate chip muffin. Mmmmmmm. Love the Tim's.   Canadian cities have one on every block (we have two in our  hick town ) but many Americans have never had the pleasure of a large with cream, double-cupped. So sad.

       Do you ever have one of those days when you can see the threads between disparate pieces of information? I'm having one of those days.  &nbsp; I was listening to the audiotape of&nbsp;  urlLink The World Below   by Sue Miller in my car today and she was talking about how email snippets kept over time act like a diary for us now, meaning that anyone who went to the trouble of going through our various email correspondances might get an idea of who we were and what we were all about. Very interesting, I thought. &nbsp; Then, I ran into  urlLink  Jason Clarke's Bigger Boat  &nbsp;post today that starts off on the email as a waste of paper rant, but turns into a discussion of how email is really a repository of ourselves over time. He also discusses Salon.com's&nbsp; urlLink  Too&nbsp;Much of a Good Thing  &nbsp;on how email is inefficient and needs to be replaced, which brought me to Carmi Levy's recent article in Processor.com called  urlLink  Turn it all Off   which makes basically the same point. &nbsp; I, personally am addicted to email in about the same way I am blogging, so it was all very interesting. I like when I can make all of those connections. I wonder if it was because I finally rented  urlLink  Signs  &nbsp;last night?

       According to the latest  urlLink UN development ratings , Canada is the 4th best place in the world to live. And, yes, we beat the U.S. by a longshot.  Not surprising, but really cool.

       It's recently come to my attention that I'm an apathetic loser. I've suspected as much for some time, but I've confirmed it now. I came to this realization while I was listing out the things I'm "in charge of" at home.  I don't cook. It's not that I can't cook (which I can't), it's that Arthur likes cooking, so I never bothered to learn, and now I  expect  him to do the cooking.  I don't garden. It's not that I don't like to garden, just that I didn't really know how, and Arthur seems to enjoy it, so I don't bother with that either.  I don't take care of our finances. OK - in this case, Arthur is a financial advisor, so it would seem kind of silly if I took care of it. I'm not sure on which days of the month I even get paid - but Arthur knows.  I don't buy groceries. I usually come along for the ride, but I don't make the purchasing decisions. My rationale is that Arthur is the one who cooks, so he should decide what we buy.  So, what do  I  do, you might ask? That's a reasonable question. I've figured out that, basically, I do all the things that Arthur doesn't like doing. Not because I like doing them, just because there's a void there that needed to be filled, and since I have extra time, what with not having to cook, garden, shop, or pay the bills, it falls to me to complete them.   So - I do the laundry (sometimes Arthur will help wash the laundry, but I generally fold it, and ALWAYS put it away), I clean the toilets (ah - the glamour), I help the kids with homework, I empty the dishwasher, and I talk to our mothers on the phone. I'm sure there's other things, but I'm noticing that the list isn't very interesting, and doesn't promise to get better if I really think about it.  If I wasn't such an apathetic loser, I could have claimed the more interesting household tasks, but I didn't really care. So now I do all the mundane chores. I could fight for my right to garden, but (and this is how I'm  sure  I'm an apathetic loser), it doesn't make that big of a difference to me...  So why am I even ranting? I don't know - just something to write about...guess I'll get back to scrubing toilets.

       Well, we survived our trip to the cottage (OK - it was more like a "summer home" than a cottage - realistically, if the place is nicer than your primary residence, it should be upgraded from  cottage  to  summer home . I'm pretty adamant on this topic).  We wimped out on the whole  urlLink Jesus  thing, though.  Sigh .  I almost pushed their 8-year old kid off the boat, though, when he started correcting my definitions. Frankie wanted to know what a  urlLink wake  was, and I said it was the splashy stuff behind the boat, so as to keep it simple. Of course, the little annoyance had to say, "That's not what it is, Trillian, it's...(and here I stopped listening to him because his defination wasn't that of a wake).   I wanted to say:  "See! Right there. That's why no one likes you!"  but I sensed that this might upset his parents (In retrospect, I guess I should have, given my last post on this topic). Frankie Mouse doesn't like him either, he calls him a "know it all". My husband calls him an "ass" which I think is more to the point. Not really his fault though, I think it's a lack of good parenting. Nonetheless, we were fairly leisurely in commanding Frankie Mouse to stop pushing him off the dock.  (Oh, stop gasping - he was fine! And really, any true boy would have pushed Frankie back).   Before we left for the  (ahem)  cottage, I demanded that Arthur stop at his office and pick up hisnotebook computer so that I could do some writing on the way up (it's a four hour drive). Good thing, too. I wrote for at least 10 minutes before I put the laptop away and didn't touch it again until I unpacked it from the car when we got home last night.  Sigh .  Anyhoo - I promise to write more this week. And I envision it being very entertaining (well, at least for me)...

        urlLink This  is what happens when you don't administer driving tests to the elderly early enough. This was taken from a Dayton Ohio police red-light enforecement camera. (Don't worry - the old lady and the Subaru driver escaped with minor injuries and the pedestrian lived). You can read the whole account at  urlLink Snopes .  I can certainly understand why she was driving so fast - if you've only got a few years left on this earth, you'd likely be in a hurry to get everything done. It makes more sense than the blue hairs driving at the speed of snail in their white Cadillacs...But who am I? I'll see when I'm 75 I guess.

       My slightly annoying friend (you know, the one that  urlLink loves the mobile ) invited us up to their cottage (a modest $1M shack) so far in advance that we couldn't come up with an excuse not to go. As the date approaches, Arthur and I are becoming more apprehensive. He has pointed out that the 2 days we'll be spending there comprise 20% of my total annual vacation allotment.  We are determined to make them despise us so as not to seek our company for future outings. After much musing, we've decided to pretend that we've found God and attempt to convert them over the vacation. This is better than my original plan of just pickling myself in an alcoholic stupor.  I am determined. I will prevail.

       I saw my second  urlLink Crossfire  today. Both in the same neighbourhood (and before you get smart, they were two different colors). Nice car. Chrysler is finally grabbing some style.  But, the  urlLink MINI  will always be my true love. [Sigh]. Some day.

       Hoo. Very good long weekend. We had a great last minute Canada day BBQ on Thursday and I got a little (heh heh, understatement) tipsy and told my family about my blog. Hi Mom! (I guess I'll have to watch my language). It was bound to happen sooner or later. At least I'll have one for-sure reader now...

       We adopted Dumb and Dumber (from my previous post) to fill the void left from the disappearance of our last beloved cat, Sally.  She was three years old, and possibly the best cat ever. But about a month ago, she went out for the night and never came back. We thought it was coyotes living in the cornfield behind us that must have gotten her, but  urlLink this story  gives me hope that she might return some day.

       I adopted twins yesterday. Psycho, evil, black twins with extra toes. When I left this morning, they were hiding behind the couch. We haven't named them because we can't catch them to see what sex they are.  No - I'm not crazy (or at least no crazier than before this post). They're 8-week old  urlLink polydactyl kittens . All black. Both of them. They were raised in a barn and don't like people very much. My daughter thinks they hate her, and I had to explain that they hate everyone equally right now. Once they've settled in, they'll only hate Arthur.  Last night I could hear a plucking sound like they were scratching a screen. I came running down, and the obviously dumber of the two (most likely the male), had scaled the screen door all the way to the top and had wedged himself between that door and the glass door. He had a really good grip (I'm guessing it was his extra digits) and we had to nearly saw him in half to get him out.  What was he thinking? That the screen was easier to penetrate near the top? And if he did get through, it's a bit of a drop. Not a lot of fore-though there. Good grief. The smarter of the two just watched from the safety of the kitty litter (which they apparently know how to use).  Then, they cried for their mother and ran around knocking things down most of the night.  I'm not liking them too much right now, but I'm hoping we can all come to some sort of agreement soon. For instance, if they stop crying and maybe don't climb the screen, then I'll, say, continue to feed them and scoop their pooh. Whatdya think?  I was really excited about getting them - I was all pumped and hopping around and saying to Arthur every 5 minutes, "Aren't you excited about getting them?" And he would look at me deadpan and say "I'm happy that you're excited. Is that good enough?" (Arthur isn't a cat-person (and he recently found out that he's also not a dog-person either)).  Anyway - the actual purpose of this blog is the name issue we're having. Benjy wants to name them Pumpkin and Sweetie. Frankie wants to call them Zoro and Puss N' Boots, I want to call them Loki and Bartleby, and Arthur doesn't care (although he thinks Imwith and Stupid would be funny. Argh!).  Does anyone have a good idea for names for identical black cats of undetermined sex that have extra toes and are real hellians? If so, send them my way!

       You all know about my Arthur - husband, chef, father, mini-van driver -he's all those things and more.   Well, now he's  a blogger too!  He's been pigeon-holed into calling himself Arthur since that's what I already call him here - but he's playing along wonderfully. Not too many posts up yet, but it's coming along.  urlLink Check him out.

       Whilst playing darts in our garage, Ford asked us "Who's your top 5?" (that's top 5 stars you're allowed to sleep with (with your spouse's permission) if you should ever come upon them (no pun intended).  I chose, in VERY specific order:    urlLink Matthew McConaughy    urlLink Owen Wilson    urlLink Colin Firth    urlLink Hugh Grant    urlLink Jude Law    Arthur went "all time" which means that I don't have to worry about half of them, as they're very much deceased:    urlLink Marlene Dietrich  (DEAD)   urlLink Rita Hayworth  (ALSO DEAD)   urlLink Angelina Jolie  (Smugly Alive)    urlLink Sophie Morrow  (Arthur is too good looking for a French chick to be attracted to him)   urlLink Carrie Ann Moss  (Yeah, well, she's pretty hot)   If I was going "all time", I would have included  urlLink Cary Grant , but I wanted to keep my options a little more open. Not sure what I'd say if I met one of my "5" walking down the street, though.   "Hi, you don't know me, but you're on my "List" and my husband says it's ok if I sleep with you. Why are you backing away? Where are you going? Hey! Wait!"

       As you know, Arthur and I were foolish enough to host a Saturday thru Monday reunion for his father's family this past weekend.  I'm exhausted, which I'm taking as a sign that I had a really good time. Arthur's family was pretty funny and they certainly know how to have a good time.  Here are some reunion take-aways that you can keep in mind for your next family gathering.     1. Nothing in the world removes purple popsicle from a suede couch. Nothing.  2. Ditto with vomit containing said victuals.  3. Enjoy your uncle's homemade wine in moderation (thus avoiding #2).  4. Your favorite lawn chair will always break, and you will be in it when it does.  5. Kids with water guns run faster than uncles with beer.  6. Alcohol consumption and lawn darts don't mix.  7. If someone pisses you off, hold your tongue and remember that you won't have to see them for another 25 years.  8. The people who did nothing to help with the meal are always the first in line to eat it.  9. Keep an air freshener in the bathroom for Uncle Hank's morning constitutional.  10. Aunt Jo will not see the humor in putting the roasted-pig's head on a stick and quoting from "The Lord of the Flies."        Also, I might point out that if your last name is White, you should avoid putting signs on your lawn that read   "White's Reunion"   or   "White Party"   - it sends the wrong message to your neighbors.
