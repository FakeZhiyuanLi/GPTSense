      They turned off Aaron’s stomach pump last Wednesday or Thursday. But they haven’t removed it yet. They want to make sure he doesn’t get nauseous before they take it out. But it has been a few days now and I think he’s doing fine. I didn’t feel like doing much this past week. Didn’t feel like working either. But I made it. I guess I just haven't been getting much sleep lately. Kevin and I went to Rod’s last night. Today, we’ve just sat around the house. I just don’t want to do anything!

      Man! Did I ramble on yesterday or what!  1. Now that food has replaced sex in my life, I can't even get into my own pants.   2. Marriage changes passion. Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.   3. I saw a woman wearing a sweat shirt with "Guess" on it. So I said "Implants?" She hit me.   4. I don't do drugs. I get the same effect just standing up fast.   5. Sign in a Chinese Pet Store: "Buy one dog, get one flea..."   6. I live in my own little world. But it's OK. They know me here.   7. I got a sweater for Christmas. I really wanted a screamer or a moaner.   8. If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal?   9. I don't approve of political jokes. I've seen too many of them get elected.   10. There are two sides to every divorce: Yours and Shithead's.   11. I love being married. It's so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.   12. I am a nobody, and nobody is perfect; therefore, I am perfect.   13. Everyday I beat my own previous record for number of consecutive days I have stayed alive.   14. How come we choose from just two people to run for president and 50 for Miss America?   15. Isn't having a smoking section in a restaurant like having a peeing section in a swimming pool?   16. Why is it that most nudists are people you don't want to see naked?   17. Snowmen fall from Heaven unassembled.   18. A good friend will come and bail you out of jail...but, a true friend will be sitting next to you saying, "Damn...that was fun!"   19. I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose-fitting  clothing. If I HAD any loose-fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!   21. When I was young we used to go "skinny dipping," now I just "chunky dunk."   22. The worst thing about accidents in the kitchen is eating them.   23. Don't argue with an idiot; people watching may not be able to tell the difference.   24. Wouldn't it be nice if whenever we messed up our life we could simply press 'Ctrl Alt Delete' and start all over?   25. Stress is when you wake up screaming and then you realize you haven't  fallen asleep yet.   26. Just remember...if the world didn't suck, we'd all fall off.   27. Why is it that our children can't read a Bible in school, but they can  in prison?   28. Wouldn't you know it...Brain cells come and brain cells go, but FAT cells live forever.

      Sunday, May 23, 2004  Much has happened these past few days. My friend, Cindy, called me on Thursday and told me her son, Aaron, had a bike accident and was in the hospital. They live on a hill and Aaron was trying to show his six year old brother, Marcus, that he shouldn’t be afraid to ride his bike down the hill. Aaron ended up falling off the bike and hurt his pancreas. He’s been in the hospital since then. Right now they are waiting to see if he gets better on his own. Otherwise, they will have to do surgery and he will be in the hospital for at least another 3 weeks.  My mom came to Austin last Wednesday and I went down there this weekend. It was a stressful time. Actually, my entire life has been stressful lately. So stressful, I almost feel on the verge of a breakdown! Which is strange because I’ve never felt like that before. But I can just tell it is building up inside of me. The combo of work and home stress has just gotten to be too much for me. I wish I could just take some time off and relax!  Things have been rough. I’ve been to the hospital everyday to see Aaron and give Cindy my support. Sometimes I feel like they just want to be alone and don’t want me there, but Cindy always tells me she does. Cindy’s ex-husband (Aaron’s dad) flew in from Seattle and has been staying in the hospital room with Cindy. She’s been a bit stressed over that too. He is now a woman (yes you read that right) and will be having "the operation" next month. I think it has been hard for her to have to explain to Aaron’s guests. Robert is now Rene. I guess Rene also talks about herself a lot and Cindy is just tired. When she first told me Aaron was in the hospital, I didn’t think it was that serious. As I was getting off the elevator at the hospital, there was a cancer baby crying in the hall with his mom (he was 2) and it really hurt my heart. Then I walked into Aaron’s room and he was in so much pain. I almost lost it.  I’ve been to see Aaron everyday, but I wonder if they don’t want me there so much. (I have this problem with anxiety and so this is all probably in my head.) I mentioned this to Jenni (Cindy’s daughter. Aaron’s older sister) and she said I was crazy. So that made me feel good. But I still feel like maybe I shouldn’t "crowd them" so much. I went to the doctor about my feeling anxious and she put me on some medication, but it made me feel bad and so I’m not taking it. I’m just going to try and cope with the feelings I have. Now that I realize there isn’t any justification for the way I feel, I’m hoping I’ll be able to deal with it. I need to realize I’m not in the way and try to get over the feelings of being in the way. But I’ve noticed those feelings are getting stronger and stronger every day. I feel like people don’t like me and don’t want me around. Even though I have no reason to feel that way. I’ve also wanted to be alone more and more. These are all signs of an anxiety disorder and that scares me. I don’t understand it and I don’t know how to deal with it. I was thinking today how I would like to take a vacation by myself and not have to speak to or worry about anyone. I want to get away and not have to talk to Kevin or my family or anything. I think it would be nice to go to Vegas by myself and just stay at a hotel and play the nickel slots and come home. Just sit there by myself all alone and relax. It’s now 10:45pm and I know I should go to bed. But I don’t want to. I’m sitting outside, writing on my iBook and I don’t want it to end. I don’t want to go to work tomorrow. I want to be free to have time to do whatever I want without having to work. (But who doesn’t want that!)  Kevin went out Friday while I was at the hospital with Aaron and I don’t know when he got home. My mom and family came to see my house Saturday and Kevin didn’t help clean or anything because he went out. He stayed in the workout room when they got here because he was so hung over. He didn’t even say hi to anyone. This really upset me and my mom. She wanted to see him. He put me over the edge. Now he feels bad about it and says he is upset because he doesn’t have any friends. I think his problem is that he doesn’t try to make friends. It took a very long time for him to come with me to Chris and Cindy’s. He used to think he didn’t have anything in common with them and so wouldn’t go to visit with me. But now he goes and whenever him and Chris are together, they just talk constantly! I told Kevin I was leaving because of what he did, but I’m not. He knows he screwed up. Now let’s see if he fixes the problem. I just wish he gave me more affection. I’ve never been on my own and I don’t think I could leave him unless things got extremely bad. But god, I can’t handle his drinking anymore! I drink every night. But I don’t become a different person. When Kevin drinks, he is totally different. I’ve never known a person like that. It’s like I live with 2 different people. The sober Kevin and the crazy Kevin. And I hate the crazy Kevin. But he is so controlling over me. Sober or not. I do admit I need some control over me. But sometimes he is too much. I just take it a day at a time.  But on a good note, Aaron is doing much better today. My Aunt is doing much better (although the cancer is still there) and Kevin realizes he needs to do better. Hopefully everything will work out.   Live for today. For tomorrow never comes.   -Shane

      I just read my Mom's Blog entry for today. In it, she mentions that the doctors found another mass in my aunt's body (she has cancer). And my mom asked, "Do we really live for today?" Well, I say yes. Yes we live for today and only for today. For who knows what tomorrow holds. Why waste life by putting off until tomorrow or waiting until tomorrow when none of us really know if tomorrow will ever come? I say live life today and live it to the fullest. Worry about tomorrow when and if it comes.

      Kevin and I went to a slot machine sell today. We almost bought two machines for a total of $600. Thankfully, there was a long line and by the time we got to the front of the line, we had buyer's remorse and decided to leave. Saved us $600!  I got my car back from the shop today. They fixed the front side dent I caused when I hit a sign pole. But they broke something in the door and now the passenger front door won't open! I swear, that car has been bad luck for me since I got it! I am going to have to get rid of it and get the Mercedes-Benz C320 Coupe I want.

      A lot has happened lately. My Aunt Patty has been sick for awhile. She doesn't believe in going to the doctor and so has been trying to fix the problem herself. They thoght she had something called Croins disease. A few days ago she was in a lot of pain and so they took her to the ER. Turns out she has cancer. She had surgery, but they couldn't remove all of it. She won't do chemo but is going to try "home remedies." My grandmother is driving to Texas to visit. I'm going to go to Austin this weekend to see everyone. The weekend after that, my mom will be there and so I plan on going to Austin again.   I'm on vacation this week. Kevin and I went to Las Vegas and stayed at the Hilton. We went so I could go to the Star Trek Experience. It was great! We did both rides, "The Borg Experience" and "The Klingon Experience." Both were awesome. I got to walk onto the bridge of the Enterprise D during the Klingon Experience and was beside myself! Growing up, I used to dream of being able to stand on the bridge of the Enterprise. Never did I think it would ever happen! We also went to Quark's Bar. Quark and his bar are from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. It was great! I drank Romulan Ale and got my picture with a Klingon and Quark himself! Oh, when Kevin and I arrived in Las Vegas...as we were getting off the plane, I found a quarter in Kevin's seat. When we got off the plane, I walked up to a slot machine in the airport, played the quarter, and won $5. Later that day, as we were walking through the Hilton, I walked up to another slot machine and played a dollar for no reason. I won $50! Of course, I ended up spending that money. But I still had fun. I bought about $50 worth of stuff from the Star Trek gift shop and so I think I came out pretty even. I didn't go to Vegas to gamble and win big, but I did have fun playing the nickle slots.   I just bought a new iBook G4 about two weeks ago. My excuse was that my old laptop, a Sony Vaio, was starting to die. Well, not really, so the "3" key stuck. That was a good enough reason for me! Now I have a PowerMac G5 and an iBook. I just bought an Airport Extreme Card for my PowerMac and so now all of my computers are connected. Its cool because I can save everything on my PowerMac and basically use my iBook as a "screen and keyboard" extension of my desktop computer.   About two weeks ago, I was at my friend's Chris and Cindy's and made a run to the grocery store. As I pulled into the parking lot, it started to hail and so I tried to pull up under an overhang to keep from getting more hail damage to my Infiniti G35. I accidently hit a sign post and put a big dent in the front side of my car. Its been in the shop the past week getting fixed. Going to cost me $850! I didn't even bother reporting it to my insurance company. Why? I don't want an At Fault Accident listed on my record just so I can get $300 from my insurance company. I really feel this car has been bad luck since I bought it. I got rearended after having it for only a month. Then I got hail damage while it was in the shop for the rear damage. When I finally got my car back (the shop took 3 months to fix a job that should have taken 7 days), Kevin ran into the driver's door and dented it. Now I hit a sign pole and had to have the front side replaced. Not to mention I've never been able to get my seat comfortable! I know, I'm crazy! I think I'm going to  get rid of it and buy a Mercedes-Benz C320 Coupe. (Really a hatch back...but I like it.)   That's all for today....Until next time...

      How honest should I be in my blog considering the fact that my Mom reads it?….  I found an old journal that I started with my mom about 3 years ago. The plan was for us to write in it and mail it back and forth to each other. But there is only one entry from me and one from her. It’s my fault because it was my turn to write, I just  never sent it back. Plus now that we have these blogs (and the fact that we talk every other day), there isn’t much for us to write about to each other!  Kevin is flying and all day today I was wondering if and when Cindy would call to invite me over. Around 4:30 I decided to call and invite myself. She said she was just thinking of calling me when I called. How funny. I think we see each other every other day now. She found out her daughter has been smoking pot again. We have gone through this before and she said she stopped. She actually stopped for a long time while she was dating her boyfriend, Carrie. But now that they’ve broken up, she’s been hanging out with the "old group" again. It was a rough night. Cindy would talk to me and then Jenni and I just didn’t know what to say to either of them. The final decision was that Jenni is to stop smoking or she has to move to her dad’s in Seattle. Jenni doesn’t want to move. So she has to stop…plus there will be random drug tests to make sure she isn’t smoking. I wish she could find a better group of friends to hang with…  I probably already mentioned this, but I got the hail damage fixed on my car. I love my car now! Maybe because I think I finally got the seat comfortable??? Ever since I bought it, I haven't been able to get my seat right and it has driven me crazy! Maybe now I will be happy with it. I’m so weird. I know it has to be my anxiety that makes me weird about my car seat. There are flys all over my back yard and in my dog’s food dishes. I went to the store and bought this fly trap that kind of looks like a mini Bird house. Basically, it is just sticky all over and the flys are supposed to stick to it. But they just seem to walk all over it!   Cindy thanked me again tonight for all that I do for her family. But I just don’t see it. What do I do that is so great? They tell me I’m like a part of their family, but what is it that makes me a part of them? I feel good that they think that, but I don’t know what I do to make them feel that way. I’m just being me. I’m so glad I got to go over there tonight. I really like being there and just hanging around. I guess I just crave the "family experience."  When you have a family, there’s just always something to do. Even if it’s just watching t.v. together. It’s nice. I miss my family. I think Cindy’s family is my home away from home. It’s almost like I’m the big brother that has his own place and comes over for dinner all the time or something. If I lived close to home, I would do it all the time. My brother, Matthew, got in trouble again. He lied and said he was going with his friend to his friend’s grandmother’s to go swimming. But they did something else instead. This isn't  the first time he has lied about what he was doing and it is really upsetting my mom. I know he’s a teenager now, but I wish he wouldn’t lie like that! I’m liking my new haircut now. I was really upset about it at first, but now I  like the change. I feel "cute." And I haven't felt that way in a long time.

      June 26, 2004  What a rough week at work! We’ve gotten really busy and it has been hard to keep up. I found out I didn’t get the Bodily Injury Adjuster position. They told me I need to be at a 105 on my yearly review and that I need to be more supportive to my team members. Okay…I practically run our "Fun Committee." Not to mention I am constantly helping others, planning training classes, etc. I think they just don’t want me for the position but didn’t have a good excuse why. No problem. I’ll let them pay for me to go to school and then re-evaluate my priorities. Not to mention, the job I have now is perfect for me while I’m in school since it is easy and 8-4:15. I’m really not that upset I didn’t get the promotion. I don’t need the money (though it would be nice). I think I just feel like I need to advance my career (because that is what you do). But I actually like what I’m doing now.  I got finally got the hail damage fixed on my car after almost a year of putting it off. Cost me $650. But it was worth it. It’s nice to see my car without any dents on it for once! Kevin and I went with Rod Friday night to see Michael Moore’s newest movie, " Fahrenheit 9/11." It was very good…though I’ve already seen most of the clips on the news. He put them together in an interesting way that really makes you think. God, I hope Bush isn’t re-elected!

      I went to get my hair cut yesterday, but the guy that normally cuts my hair wasn't there and so I let another girl do it. I told her not to cut it short. Well, when I got home I realized it was so short I literally couldn't do anything with it. Not to mention my side burns and neck where uneven! And the top was lopsided! I was so depressed I just went to bed and stayed there the entire night. I called the manager (who is also the guy that normally cuts my hair) and told him I was coming in to get it fixed so it could at least grow out even. I was very uncomfortable going there (the lady that messed my hair up was working), but he made me feel okay. When he was fixing my hair, he kept my chair turned away from her the entire time, which was nice. It's very short and I really don't like it, but it is better than before!

      People at work kept bugging me to do a lotto pool and so I finally agreed. We have about 160 tickets and the jackpot is $120 mil. Maybe I'll be a millonaire tomorrow! I would quit my job and volunteer at Cook Children's hospital!

      I signed up for some college courses today and I feel great. I need a change and finishing my degree will help me do that. I didn't realize how close I was to having it! I didn't think a lot of my classes from Florida would transfer to a Texas college...but most of them will. Still, I am at least a year away from my degree because of the difference between Texas and Florida. But I'm not complaining. My work will pay for the classes. I just have to buy the books.  Kevin is flying again, but will be home tomorrow. Then he is off for a week. Must be nice. I wish I was a flight attendant and had as much time off as him. It would be nice to have a job where you worked a day or two and came home and didn't have to worry about following up with someone. It would be nice to have a job where you didn't have "files" to work. Where you finished your work for the day and that was it! I miss jobs like that! But I don't have that luxury. I have a job where I have a "case load" to work. I could have to deal with the same customer for days, weeks, or even months. I'm waiting to find out if I get a promotion to a Bodily Injury Claims Adjuster position. I would still have a case load, but I would be able to get out of the office and I think I would have more freedom.

      So this is it. This is my life. Another day where nothing happened. Another day were I didn't make a difference. And it passes so quickly. I feel like I should be doing more with my life. I feel like I should be out in the world. I just don't know what it is I should be doing out there. I have a good job...but I no longer have the satisfaction I once had. I still like my job...but at the same time, I want more. I feel like I'm being held back. In work and in life. I want more freedom. I feel like everything is so mechanical and tied down. I wish I could sing or dance or act or do something with some talent! But I can't. When I acted, I was just an "okay" actor. When I danced, I felt like I was just an "okay" dancer. And God knows I can't sing. No matter how much I love it. So here I am with an ordinary life. Ordinary relationship problems. Ordinary me. Life is passing me by so fast I can't grasp it. How do you grab a hold of dreams...always floating just out of reach? I used to have such high hopes for myself. I used to think I would do something of meaning. Now I just work my office job, come home and watch t.v. and then do it all over again the next day. I miss my family. I miss not having to go to work every day. I miss the beach and being outside. I miss being in shape and being able to do Russian splits 5 feet in the air. I want to be in charge. Of who I am and what I do. But I haven't been in a long time. I'm tired of being told how to do things and when to do them. I want to be me damn it! I want to be free! I want to fly and catch my dreams. Ah, but that's the trouble with dreams. You don't always remember them when you wake up.   How do you pull yourself up again? How to do start when you don't know where start is? How do you make a change when things are already set on a certain track? Where do you find the courage to try? I'm stuck. Sinking in quicksand, yet being held afloat by dreams. Dreams, like branches, so close, you almost feel you can pull yourself out...yet too far away to reach.

      I went to the horse races with Chris and Cindy today. Ended up spending $40. But we had a good time and so it was worth it. After the races, we went back to their place for dinner. We started to watch a movie, but it was 8pm and I wanted to go home. Nothing else special happened.

      Aaron got out of the hospital Friday! I was supposed to go to the horse races with Chris and Cindy, but Kevin didn't want to go and so we're going tomorrow since Kevin will be working. Kev and I went shopping at Central Market and looked at cars today. I checked out BMW's as a replacement for my Infiniti G35, but didn't like them. I still want the Mercedes C320 Coupe (more like a hatchback). Kevin hates it because he says it's a "wanna be" car, but I like it. Maybe because it reminds me of my VW Beetle. We watched "Big Fish" tonight. What a great movie! Made me cry!

      Thursday, June 10, 2004  How annoying! I had almost finished my entry and then I accidentally deleted the entire thing! That’s the second time I’ve done that to myself!  Anyhow, Kevin and I were supposed to go see Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban last Friday (June 4th). But Rod came over and I could tell he didn’t want to go, so I went by myself while him and Kevin went shopping at Fry’s. It was good, but not as good as the book, of course. After I got home from the movie, I tried to hang out with Kevin and Rod, but I was too tired. I guess from spending the day in the hospital for my chest and the pain medicine just made me tired. So I went to bed.  My friend, Cindy, got someone to stay with Aaron in the hospital Saturday so she could spend the night at home. Her and Chris invited Kevin and me over for dinner. Chris grilled meat and I did the peppers and onions and we had fajitas. I made a "volcano" out of the onions on the grill. (It’s a trick I learned from going to Japanese Hibachi restaurants. You stack the onion rings up like a volcano and then use oil to make them spew fire from the center like a volcano. DON’T TRY AT HOME! HAHAHA) We had a good time.   Sunday, I went to a Blue’s festival with Kevin, Rod, and Rod’s friend, Daniel. We had a great time and saw BB King, Bo Diddily, Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, John Maer, and more. Kevin got drunk and was a little bad. I got mad at him….you know, the usual.  Monday was good at work. My chest didn’t hurt for the first time in days and it actually wasn’t a stressful day! I picked Cindy up from the hospital last night and her and I went to happy hour at Bennigins. My dad told me that him and Nicky (my 15 year old brother from my dad and ex-step mom) got in a fight and Nicky tried to hit my dad. So he called the police and Nick spent 6 days in a half-way house. But everything is okay now.  Kevin is flying and will be back tonight. I’m just sitting out back with the dogs enjoying myself until he gets home. That’s all for today!

      Not much happened this week. Aaron is getting better every day. They finally took the stomach pump tube out of his nose. So far, so good. I visited him yesterday and he looked great. He was laughing and watching "Scary Movie 3." I had really bad, constant chest pains all day yesterday. My friend, Cindy, told me I should go to the ER, but I didn’t. I went home to bed. When I woke up this morning, I still had the pains…though not as bad. I called my doctor and she told me to go to the ER. So I had to waste a vacation day to spend my Friday in the hospital. Thankfully, my heart is fine. The doctor thinks it might be muscle pain or slight swelling in my chest. They gave me an anti-inflammatory through an I.V. It helped a little, but the pain is still there. So I guess it is just wait and see. A few days ago, we had some really bad storms here. The tornado sirens went off for an hour. I was stupid and ran outside to see if a tornado was near! Kevin yelled at me and made me come back in. Talk about scary! I’ve never been in a storm bad enough for the sirens to go off. I thought for sure we were going to get hit and the roof blown off! Thankfully, we just had bad rain, but missed the tornado’s and hail!

      Just another day. Work went pretty well. I think I may actually be able to get caught up by the end of the week! Kevin is flying and so I went to Cindy's for dinner. I bought Chris a "Three Stooges" DVD and we watched it tonight. I got home and found a package on my doorstep from my mom. She bought me a pasta pot (see my prior wish list posting). I like the pot, but my favorite part was the towel she put in the pot to keep it from banging around. It smells like home.   :-( My brother, Matt, got busted for shoplifting today. Thankfully they didn't call the police. I hope he doesn't turn out to be a bad kid! I don't think he will...I think - and hope - he's just going through his teenage stage...

      I've Got the World on a String  I've got the world on a string Sitting on a rainbow Got the string around my finger What a world what a life Ooh I am in love  I've got this song that I sing I can make the rain go Anytime I move my finger Lucky me can't you see I am in love  Life is a beautiful thing As long as I've got a hold of that string I'd be a silly so-and-so If I should ever let go  I got the world on a string Sitting on a rainbow Got the string around my finger Lucky me can't you see I am in love

      I got my car back from the dealership today. I just had some regular maintenance items that had to be done. Though it did cost be $160 for an oil change and to clean the injectors (or something like that). I also found out that the dealership would give me $22,000 to trade in my car...but I owe $26,000 and don't know that I want to waste all that money to buy another car. Cindy picked me up from work yesterday and we had a short happy hour. Kevin picked me up from Cindy's and then spent the rest of the night sitting in front of his computer. He's gotten hooked on researching geneology lately. Not much else has happened...until next time.  - Shane

      What am I doing with my life? I just seem to be watching it pass me by. So many things I want to do and be. And yet here I am. Staying stagnant. Nothing but a billabong. How do I make things happen? How do I get my life started? I have a good job, I'm successful. And yet I feel like I'm missing out. How do I make the changes to become the person I want to be? Life is a beautiful thing. I want to have the world on a string!   What I want:  1. I want to teach.  2. I want to work with kids.  3. I want a child.  I want, I want , I bloody want!  So how do I get it? I feel like life hasn't given me the chance to be who I want to be. I have all the material things I could want. Yet I want more. Though I've started feeling like the material things aren't what I want. I used to think that was it. That I just wanted the nice house and the nice car. But now I feel more than that. I feel like I want love and meaning. I don't feel like I have that yet. How do I get the bloody things I want? I don't think I want them...I think I need them! Which makes the yearning even worse!

      Another week is gone. Time seems to pass me by so fast now. Not much happened this past week. Safeco Insurance denied my diminshed value claim on my car, which has been stressing me out. Now I'm going to have to take their insured to small claims court. Just writing about it upsets me.  Kevin and I went to Rod's last night. We pretty much wasted today laying around the house. Tomorrow we're supposed to go on the boat with Cindy and her family. Not much else going on.

      Kevin and I went over to Chris and Cindy's Friday night for dinner. We drank way too much and I was hurting all day Saturday. Completely wasted the entire day sitting in front of the tellie. Sunday, we went out on the boat. Cindy's friend's, Cathy and Les, invited us out on their boat. I went with Chris and Cindy, Kevin showed up later with our boat. Chris went home but Cindy and her son, Aaron, stayed on the boat with Kevin and I. We spent most of the time letting Aaron try to waterski. He started getting pretty good towards the end...but I think we was getting too tired to keep going. Kevin also let him drive the boat all day, which Aaron really enjoyed. I was so tired by the time we got home, I crashed on the couch before managing to drag myself to bed.   "Milk, Milk -- Lemonade -- Around the corner, fudge is made."

      Another busy day at work. Busy, but not stressful. I told my supervisor I would like to learn what the salvage assistants do and what the supervisors do in order to better prepare myself for a future supervisor job. I'm hoping one will open in the next few months and hopefully I'll get it this time! I went to Cindy's after work. I really enjoy being there. They think of me as part of the family and I really do feel that way. I think that's one of the reasons I like being there, is that I get the family experience that I can't get being away from my own family.   I talked to my Aunt Patty yesterday. She says she is doing good and isn't in pain.  (She just went through surgery after finding out she has cancer.) She has also chosen not to do chemo, which I can respect. She's tired of being in pain and wants to live the rest of her life without it. I'm sure she'll be around for a long time to come.

      Kevin  got called out on a flight and so I am home alone again. I finally finished writing my diminished value demand letter for my car and will fax it tomorrow. Hopefully I'll get $2,500 for it! Today was a busy day at work. Thank God I took off yesterday! They got 12 claims each (we normally get 4-6). I got 6 today. I called Aunt Patty and she is doing well. Says she isn't in pain anymore. Kevin told me I can get a new car once I get my bills paid off and if I get money for the diminished value of my car. (Don't ask for details, its a long story.) I figure in December I will get a new car...if I don't change my mind before then. I am still looking at the Mercedes C320 Coupe. Kevin hates it and says it is a "wannabe" car. But I really like it...reminds me of my Beetle I owed. Or beetles..I had 2 of them. I wish I would have kept the Beetle! It would have been paid off by now! I got my blood work back from the doctor and everything came back negative. She also tested for HIV (why not, didn't cost extra) and it was negative as well....not that I have a reason to think it wouldn't be, but its still nice to know. I just wish they could figure out what's wrong with me! I hate these tests and needles!  John Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate. Good choice I think. Though I wasn't expecting it....of course, I really didn't know who he was going to pick...but I was wondering when he was finally going to decide. I hope Kerry wins the election. I don't think I could handle another Bush term. If only I could get my Mom to vote for the democrate and not Bush! Mom! Are you reading this!!!??? Do me a favor! Vote for John Kerry! As your 1st born son, I am begging you!

      What a waste of a day! My office was closed, but man! I wish I could have gone to work! I feel so depressed right now! My Friend, Michelle, was supposed to call me when she was on her way home so we could meet at her place and hang by the pool today. My friend, Cindy, mentioned having me over for dinner and said she would call me back. Niether of them called me. So I sat home doing nothing, trying to force myself to clean house! Now I'm watching my new "Sex and the City" dvd again because nothing is on the telly! What a bloody waste!   The other night I stayed at Chris and Cindy's house while they spent their anniversary out. I had a good time. Kevin stayed with me and we spent the night playing games with Aaron and his friend. I let Jenni have some friends over and after they left us boys got in the hot tub for a bit while Jenni sat watching us...depressed because her boyfriend kept calling and making her feel bad because she wouldn't leave the house to drive them somewhere at 2am! Jenni gave me a bit of a hard time when I told her her friends had to leave by 12:30. But she got over it when they started calling and bugging her. Jenni went to bed, but I ended up staying up with the boys until 2:30 in the morning. I finally went to bed, but Kevin, Aaron, and his friend Noey, stayed up to watch a movie. They went to bed around 5, I think. That was the most fun I had my entire 3-day weekend. I spent the rest of my weekend home alone, not doing much.

      Sunday, July 4th 2004  Today was my 4 year anniversary. I didn’t get a card or anything! (But I don’t really mind.) We went to the movies and saw “Spider Man 2.” The movie was okay, but there was a family sitting behind us that drove me crazy. They had a crying baby and kept talking on their cell phones and each other! UGH!  Kevin got called out on a flight and so now I get to spend tonight alone. But I just bought the 6th season of “Sex and the City,” so that gives me something to do. I think it’s a rip off that instead of putting the entire last season on one dvd they’ve made it into two parts and split it up into two dvd’s you have to buy. What a rip off. (But of course, I’ll buy them!) I miss that show. I guess because I would watch it and wish I could live their lives. (Don’t we all?) I think it would be fun to live in the big city and have a writing career where you didn’t have to work Monday through Friday and went shopping at Prada and other expensive stores without worry. Guess I just need to win the Lotto!

      Thursday, July 1, 2004   I worked from 8am – 8:30pm today. But I don’t mind because I got caught up on most of my claims. From 6-8:30, Michelle and I decorated the office for the 4th of July party tomorrow…since no one else volunteered to help. But I don’t mind, we had a good time getting things ready.  Things have been rough between Kevin and I. We’ve just been fighting a lot…or not talking at all. I wish we could figure out the problem. But he doesn’t seem like he wants to talk about things. I’ve been having health problems too and it’s been stressing me out. The doctors can’t seem to find what is wrong! But enough of that. I get to spend tomorrow night at Cindy’s house. Her and Chris are spending the night at a nice hotel for their anniversary and so I agreed to house sit and stay with Jenni. (They don’t want her to be home alone because she’s a girl.) That’s about it for now.

      My day started out great..until my friend, Michelle, gave me an attitude at work...I know I shouldn't have let it happen, but she caused the rest of my day to be a downer because of it. The afternoon was good, though... I met Cindy for Happy Hour and then went to Central Market with her and her family to meet her brother's ex-wife Christina, her boyfriend, and their kids, for dinner. Christina's boyfriend is in the military and moving to New York in 10 days. We'll miss him...he's a really great guy. Central Market is kind of a "rich person's" grocery store. A lot of Mercedes and Lexus, etc in the parking lot. It might be expensive, but I love it! They have the best food there...and stuff you couldn't find at your local store. We sat outside on the patio and ate while the kids played on the playground. We also had a few drinks. Christina's boyfriend introduced me to a new beer called Blue Moon that you drink with an orange in it (instead of a lime). I had a good time. I got some papers to fill out before I go to the surgeon which made me start thinking about the whole situation and now I am nervous again...though I'm sure I'm fine. I just don't think it could possibly be cancer. I don't feel it in me...if that makes sense. Not much else going on. I'm going to Florida this weekend. I get there Friday, go out with my friend, Kristen, for her birthday. Then I spend all day Saturday with my family and come home. I'm really looking forward to it.  Until next time...  Work like you don't need the money, Love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one's watching...
