         Un-break My Heart  By Toni Braxton         Don't leave me in all this pain    Don't leave me out in the rain    Come back and bring back my smile    Come and take these tears away    I need your arms to hold me now    The nights are so unkind    Bring back those nights when I held you beside me    Un-break my heart    Say you'll love me again    Undo this hurt you caused    When you walked out the door    And walked outta my life    Un-cry these tears    I cried so many nights    Un-break my heart My heart      Take back that sad word good-bye    Bring back the joy to my life    Don't leave me here with these tears    Come and kiss this pain away    I can't forget the day you left    Time is so unkind    And life is so cruel without you here beside me    Un-break my heart    Say you'll love me again    Undo this hurt you caused    When you walked out the door    And walked outta my life    Un-cry these tears    I cried so many nights    Un-break my heart    My heart

        My first day of school ever since I came back. It was okie. As usual, I have to put up with the facade. Worst, had cramps. Harmo was okie. At least had Jean. She talked to me like nothing happened. Goodness, what is wrong with her? Talk to me as and when she likes and ignore me otherwise. What does she think she is? Okie, she is a whatever. I don't care. I don't wish to care. Forget it la huh.     Everybody seems to know what happens to me. It doesn't matter. I don't mind. To those who are sincere and true, thanx for all the concern. Although things will never be the same again. Hai, forget it. I do not wish to talk about it anymore. It's all over. I have to get on with my life, don't I?    Nothing ever seems to go the right way. This week is so screwed up. Worst, I left my performance shirt in M'sia and my dad has to courier it back here. Can you imagine? Courier a shirt? How stupid can things get? Whatever, I just hope it arrives in time.  Whatever, after this week, everything will be fine. Hopefully. ;)

       I have learnt. Nothing is ever  forever . Not only love. Especially for friendship. Whatever. It is beyond my control. I have no wish or mental strength to care anymore.   Whatever  .   She say yeaterday yi messaged her and ask to go together on speech day. For some reason, I feel disturbed and upset about it. Most probably by the fact that she choose to ask her instead of me. I do not understand what is happening.  Confused .   Life is full of worries and unhappiness. For a moment of happiness and bliss, there will always be 10 minutes of unhappiness. Nothing is ever going right for me. And  the main cause of trouble is her. Nontheless, she cannot be blamed totally. Maybe its just me la huh.   I really dread this coming sat. I don't know how to face it. There are worries and uncertainites as usual. I can't help it.   Whatever  . I have nothing to say anymore. Crap.

       Was what I did the right thing? I think it is. I see no need in trying hard to accomodate to you people. Since everything seems all right now, I don't think I need to elaborate.  Whatever.        &nbsp;   I saw yi online. But she went off so quickly. Is it you or is it someone else using your account. We have not talked for very long. Even if we do, it is for such a short while.  Hurt and disappointed . That is what I feel towards you. You never seemed to believe me despite our four years of friendship. I know I do not have the right to blame you for anything. But sorry, I just can't help it. Take it as I am selfish, I am jealous. But to me, you seem to believe her more.     &nbsp;   Its speech day this saturday. I do not feel any joy nor am I looking forward to it. Why? Its simple. Cause things have changed totally. They can  never  be the same again. Going back, seeing the same people, but the change is eminent, its obvious. It only makes me sad. It makes me sadder when I see what everyone can't. I can't depend on juan. Cause back there, I am reminded that I have erred. I have been mean and unkind. There is no reason for me to depend on her. I just wished everything has not happened.     &nbsp;   I never liked to escape. But this time round I wish I could. I wished I never have to go back. Go back and see all the hypocrisy, distrust, betrayal, humiliation. Especially by the ones you loved the most. They hurt you especially deep. She is a jinx. To me. To our friendship. It is all but a wish.   A wish is never meant to be fulfilled.

       I am getting really fed up with some people really. People who are fake, hypocritical, doesn't have a mind of their own and believe what others said  blindly . I thought you were smart people but you proved me otherwise. I really feel the need to say what I have to say about you people.  &nbsp;  J: you are smart but apparently academically only. otherwise, you listen to whatever she says and believe whatever she feeds to you. what really irks me is the way you behave. just like a kid. childish. don't go around with the look of distaste for you never know one thing -- you are not exactly nice to look at either.  &nbsp;  T: similarly, i believed you take her words like some valuable sacred information too. for you yourself never knew what they did to you nor said about you. yet, u faithfully do whatever they are doing. is it stupidity or what you will call loyalty.  &nbsp;  K, E, S n M : i thought you were nice. i still think you are but to a smaller extent. for i never knew whether you are their kind. if you are not, you act like you are.  &nbsp;  B: you are another one who believes what she says, i believe. i am amazed by your ability to suck up. and don't think you are one popular and chio 'babe'. ask around.  &nbsp;  Lastly, the 'mastermind' of all. I am so sick and tired of your pretense in everything you do and in anytime, any place. Don't you ever feel tired or sick? I guess you wouldn't cause its in your nature. You will stoop to anything to get your aim, to climb high, won't you? I know you think I have changed. But I have not. You did. At least before me. I do not care anymore. I can tell you. I knew it long ago. I just kept quiet about it because of yi. I know I have not been a nice angellic little girl for the past year. But I have realized my misgivings. Unlike you, I have evaluated myself before critisising others.  &nbsp;  All I can ever say to you is to leave us alone. You are just one manipulating ugly pest who just wouldn't relent. Do you know what you did showed the so very ugly side of you? Don't go round blaming everybody except yourself when things do not go your way. Everyone in the world may believe you but I don't care. I just regretted ever knowing you existed. I wished you out of my life.  Forever .  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       I am so so dead. Only 2 days of n-day holidays are left and I have not only plan my activities, I am left with a humongous pile of undone work. And my common tests are common tests are like what? Less than a week away. I am in deep trouble. Besides that, I still have tons of newspaper to cut! Omg. I just don't understand. How come some peeps know how to maximize their time when all they do is go out and play? And I worked hard and still is behind schedule. It's just so damn unfair, ain't it? Argh!      I even arrange to meet up with yi and ling to work out in the gym tomorrow. If there is one bright spot in my life right now, it is the fact that I am doing some catching up with my   friends   and she   is not part of it. It doesn't matter all the things and hard times she has caused for me. I feel that the time I spent with them especially yi is worth it. I don't mind at all. But it is this that is causing me to think too much and is starting to affect me.       I think I am going to do badly in this coming common tests, if not worse. What I am going to do?! I am so damn worried. Hai, whatever. Think I better get started now. Ciao.

       Went out with yi and ling to watch  'The Notebook'  today at cine. The show is nice as expected. But not as touching as expected. Most probably, I have read the book and know the plot. Hmm... but nonetheless, it was still worth my money =) I was thinking, should I get the book or the VCD. It was simply fantastic and  beautiful  that I want to keep it, to own it.       Anyway, I was so  happy  today.Why? Because I went out with yi and ling today! It was like the old times. Especially yi. I never realized that I missed them so much. I am so much  happier  with them than anyone of my friends. Even friends from NY. I even took many pics using yi's. I even had one of them as my wallpaper. To remind me of the great people I know and the people I care is always there in the midst of some conflict with some unworthy people. The feeling is incredible. I felt as though I retrieved something which is very important and precious after a long time. I hope there will be many more occassions. The gym trips, yeah? Yi is so funny and lame as usual. She can really make me laugh =pP      Both of them did great in cheering me up. I had this unhappiness deep in my heart ever since last night. Ever since he told me he is talking to a girl on the phone despite his explanantion that there is nothing between them. I think its ridiculous that I even feel this way because I know I have no reason too. We are just friends aren't we? I have asked myself: Do I really want to start a relationship with him? The truth is, I do not have the desire to start a relationship with him. I just want us to remain as friends only. On the other hand, why do I then, feel so upset when he acted normally yesterday or the fact that he was talking to another girl? I really honestly can't stand myself sometimes. I can be so petty and indecisive. Crappy eh? It's rather contradicting. Whatever.

      One unexpected thing happened to me today. Ms Ng asked me, mich and drey to see her after school so she can talk to us. About what? What else is there to talk about except about the 'politics' in our class? Honestly, I don't know whether that helps. I got more confused after we talked. But all I can say is that I learnt a lot from her today. Don't know why but it seems as though it is my fault. Yeah, whatever. It's always me ain't it? I am just a petty and jealous little peep la. I don't know. Is it her character or is it really her acting? I was very reluctant to give in, compromise and make peace with them. But after that, I thought I would give it a try. For Ms Ng's sake. After all, she did try to make the effort. Initially, I thought she was just so ignorant and naive and that she simply blind to everything that happens in class. Whatever. Just see what happens in the near future.  Saw him today. Our eyes met for a split second. I felt wierd, more like upset. I don't know why. Now that I am talking to him, I do not feel anything. In fact, I feel normal. Where exactly so I stand and what exactly do I wan? I think I just want us to be friends. Yeah, that's it. Friends. No more than that.

       Argh! I didn't want to blog today. But I felt that if I do not voice out my frustrations and resentments, I would burst! What the heck! What the  *toot*  is wrong with her? Damn her la. Act like a bitch. I didn't wanted to be so violent and vulgar. But I just can't help it. "Its none of my business" was what she said. What the  *toot*.  As a leader, how can you say that. Don't show me that  *toot*  attitude of yours. Like you are superior and that you are doing us a BIG favour.  *toot*  you. You get the points. Its your job. So don't show all these carp. I know that no matter how much I blog, how much I let it out, to whom did I say, I will not be appeased. Just my  *toot*  luck and fate to be stuck with you. A BITCH!! I had enough of you. I felt like having a go at you just now. It was so  close.  I don't know how much longer can I control myself. I have never seen such a despicable, hypocrtical and ugly (both internal and external) person like you. I know that no matter what I said or how much I said,   nobody   will understand what I am feeling. The feeling is so intense that I am scared of myself. Hatred. Anger. Disgust. Resentment. Frustrations. All pent up and it can brong out the worst in you. I sometimes find myself wishing the worst kinds of things to happen to her. How I wish she never existed in this world or that I never knew her. She is not fit to be. Now, I truly understand what it mean when people say the world is so  unfair . Simply, she is a dark spot in my life. Persistent and irritating.

       Hmm...felt very much better today. Not happy yet not unhappy. Ha^ Don't know what I am talking about. Well, to put it simply, today is pretty much smooth flowing as I do not need to have contact of any form with her. As long as I need not get near her, talk to her or whatsoever, not needing to see her is the  BEST.       Got along pretty well with mich and drey today. Can't seem to understand. Relationships like that seem to change like a rollercoaster. At times, it good, comfortable and fun. At other times, it is strained and stifling. PW today was great! Just nice i guess.      In life, there are many things that I don't really get it. If you do not like the person or is not used to her lifestyle, then just leave her alone. There is no need to mean to her or be critical. Because I think you do not have the right to do so. What's worse, you pretend to be nice to her when its just you alone. But when you have the other peeps together with you, you will be mean and hostile to her. What's your problem? This is your speciality ain't it? You are so fond of doing these things don't you? Just leave the poor girl alone. Will you? And don't abuse your authority. Don't force people to do things. You wanted that job. You stoop to anything to get that job. Then shouldn't fulfil your responsiblity. If you can't manage it, just quit! How could you ask some others to do your job? You are crap! Fancy asking others to do your job when you stay at home and mug, ain't I right?   Damn you  .

       Two days after the concert. Didn't get the chance to blog until now.  Ling  and  Jie  came for the concert. Was quite glad though. They made it here even though its so far. Surprisingly, wei xiu came. She even gave us each a stalk of flower. Don't know the name. It was so sweet of her. Yee hong and Jun han gave us a stalk of rose each. But it just doesn't have the impact la. I don't feel anything and I don't think it means anything. Maybe, its just that they are from the other clique. Nonetheless, it was nice of them too considering that. We just don't clique and never will. Just like oil and water don't mix.      I was hoping he would turn up for the concert. I guess he didn't. Whatever. It doesn't matter. He isn't the sort who will attend such events. It's okie.       Don't know why. But at times, I just feel that mich and drey seems to be hiding things from me. I never felt belonged when I am with them and sometimes, I even had to pretend that I am happy. Why is it so? Is it because they knew each other first? Well, at least they can try to include me, can't they? I just don't understand. Maybe its just so my fate and luck to meet 'friends' like these. Yes, I am angry. I am just so sick and tired of having to put up a facade of happiness when deep down, I know I am so not happy.   With everything  . Whatever. I do not wish to go any further.      On a lighter tone, I saw him play =) Was so glad to see him. Had change of hairstyle. Didn't quite recognise him initially. But still, he look nice and  hot . As usual =)
