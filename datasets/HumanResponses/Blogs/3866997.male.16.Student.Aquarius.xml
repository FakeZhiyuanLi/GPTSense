      I'll tell you a story, believe me its true A tale you'd best hope never happens to you Old Spicy McHaggis, how he met his fate You I can save, but for him its too late Spicy was big, burly, and strong His pipes were gigantic and so was his schlong From city to city, running around Looking for chicks over 400 pounds One night at the pub, a girl caught his eye Big as a house, just the right size The broad was enormous stacked to the hilt Spicy soon noticed a bulge in his kilt The piper delivered his best pick-up line Thought to himself, "This beast is all mine!" The portly young lady could stand for no more She grabbed his cojones and went for the door They got to her house and dimmed all the lights Spicy was in for one hell of a night He said that he loved her, he'd always be true "But Mr. McHaggis, I only just met you!" By now he saw double through his drunken eyes Neither had looks or appropriate size He came to his senses, thought to himself "At this time of night I won't find nothing else" He took off his shirt She lifted her skirt They pulled out his unit and started to play She asked for a glove He gave her a shove Had baby McHaggis nine months to the day Three packs a day, he'll smoke till he dies Spicy McHaggis, one hell of a guy!

       Ever been so content that you think it must be a dream and you keep waiting to wake up? Its a beautiful feeling. Even greater than this though is when the realization hits you that its not a dream. Its reality. They say truth is much stranger than fiction, and I suppose its the same way with dreams sometimes. Occasionally you get something so wonderful cross your path that you can't believe this reality could have surpassed your expectations so much. What was I looking for? I was looking for someone who I could tolerate. Someone who I could stand to be around for a prolonged period of time and the scariest part is that I think that's what happens to many of us. We get so convinced that there is nothing better that we settle. I was on my way to doing that until I ran across Drew. Whenever I talk to him I can't stop smiling. Thinking about kissing him knots up my stomach and my heart races. I dare not confuse this with love, that would be stupid, but I believe the potential is certainly there for he and I to have something wonderful. He makes me feel like I'm good enough just like I am and don't have to impress him in order to gain his affection. I've got it already by virtue of just being me. That's something fairly new to me. The other two guys I've been invovled with have always made me feel so much lower than they were, like I could never be good enough for them. I sit here now in absolute awe and amazement at how the most wonderful things slip into your life in the quietest ways.  The Moral of the Story: You will find financial success  in bed .

       The turbulent waters of the teenage psyche are awe-inspiring. The mind of an adolescent is naturally an unstable environment, but oh how much worse it has become since society itself has become "mobile". The world expanded from a neighborhood to an international society in such a fast time people are rushing to catch up and in the process are missing so much joy in just BEING. We have TVs, CD players, radios, and a whole plethora of different things to keep us from stopping and just enjoying the view by filling our mind with such loud and useless information. I mean, can you really think of a time you've had a life changing epiphany while watching telivision? Sure there's nothing wrong with entertainment, but when it passes the line from entertainment to distraction that's when the problem arises. Back in my grandmother's day someone would be born in and spend most of their lives if not die in a single house or at the very least a single city. I personally have no room to talk because I've lived in Wisconsin, Texas, British Columbia, and Louisiana in the past 2 years, but I regret moving so much. During my time at the seminary I was pretty much stationary. There was perfect stability. I could say with absolute surety what I would be doing the next day, whereas now things are very much UN-stable. For instance, I walked into our living room night before last. My brother looked up at me from the couch and said, "Hey, Jess, wanna go to New Orleans?" about 10 hours later, we were on our way to the Big Easy. Doing things on the spur of the moment is a wonderful thing. It keeps people on their toes, but a certain basic amount of stability is a necessity for the proper functioning of society. Just something to chew on.  Now, enough about society! More about ME! It still amazes me how someone can be just sitting around unsuspectingly and all the sudden something will happen that changes their life forever. This is how it happened with most of the great things that have happened to me in my life: my conversion to Catholicism, my parents' divorce, my decision to go to boarding school, my meeting Preston. Now, I believe one of those moment may be happening right before my eyes. I met a boy tonight through either XY or Mogenic, can't remember which. His name is Drew. So far I don't know anything about him I don't like. He's incredible to say the least. Very intelligent, charming, confident in himself, also quite confident in me which is a nice feeling, and towering over all these qualities is how much he seems to care about ME and not about what I can do for him. This is definately a feeling I'm not used to just yet. So far, I know two boys that have provided that adequately. The rest have quite obviously been using me. You know who you are, ya crazy dutch bastards. At the very least, I'm expecting Drew and I to become very good friends.  The Moral of the Story: And so the story's told of a hearty group of men it's a tale of their triumphs and their woes. Be it raids and melees ancient or the modern worker's struggle that inspires men to stand up for their rights. And should we fall down by the wayside in this ever-changing world we can look back to these heroes of our past. With their staunch determination and ferocious iron will, no tyranny would quell them in their task. It's an age-old situation with an ever-present message: that time and tide waiteth for no man. So without fear of confrontation of the consequence of outcome, it's for freedom and for happiness they toiled. An in looking to the future, we can see a better place where we can shake the yoke of tyranny for all. It's been paved by generations who have gone now to their rest. It's just remembrance of their dignity we ask. Under perilous conditions with small hope of success they left behind the lives that they once led and by virtue of their fortitude and single-minded strength they cleared the way for the people of today so when we think back to our ancestors respectfully we hark and thank the men whose struggle broke the chain it's a long road up ahead of us - let's forge on while we're strong and leave our mark of honor once again So the story has been told and it comes now to an end. It's setting any era, any land. When abusive tyrants force the hands of matters great or small, it inpires men to stand up for their rights.

       Preston hates me. I'm not entirely sure why. Love by its nature is a complicated thing, but why does it hurt people more often than not? In the throws of passion people make so many promises that are broken. You're swimming in a sea of happy feelings until one day you get a cramp and start to drown. Then all the "I love you"s all of the claims that you'll be together forever are brought to nothing. You didn't stick together the way you said you would. The feeling of hurt and disappointment from this is amplified a thousand times by the fact that you were willing to follow&nbsp;them to hell and back, but they drop you on the first bad day. It hurts, but you've gotta move on I suppose. Losing a friend never feels good, but I suppose getting hurt is an unavoidable part of life...  On the upside, I have a boyfriend now. Its that Matt guy I was talking about in my last post. I went to his house last night and met his family. Very colorful group of people if I do say so... Anyways, after an extensive makeout session that was one of the BEST I've ever had, he asked me out and I said yes. I'm definately the lucky one in this relationship. Its not everyday you find someone who's smart, romantic, AND cute all in one bundle. Hopefully this will last for a long long time. If not, I'll just have to add him to my collection of frozen pelvises... MUAHAHAHAHAHA.  Moral of the Story: Like the great falls the bedrock of my life is eroding... ERODING....   EEERRROOODDDIIINNNG

      Two weeks to the day since my last post! Oh how much has happened. For those of you who do not already know, I'm gay. Yes, that's right. Mr. Jesse Smith, the ladies man, is gay. Oh how shocking, right? *SARCASM*  Well, just before I came out I met a boy named Brad. He's such a sweetie! And talk about hott... OUCH! As with everything else I 've ever done I rushed into things and tried to make him my boyfriend. Even after we agreed that the two of us dating would only ruin a very promising friendship, I still tried to elevate him to the level of boyfriend and got myself emotionally attached to him. Luckily, I realized what a huge fucking mistake THAT was and quickly detached myself. So now, we're friends and I'd like to keep it that way for a long long time. He's awesome, and I love him to death, just like I love all my friends. Nothing more. Nothing less.  Its pretty much just been one giant emotional roller coaster since I came out to my first person. I've been trying so hard to reconcile being gay to who I am. Some of you have noticed that I've been acting much differently lately. Well, its sorta been me trying to mesh together "Trying to Be Straight Jesse" and "Gay Jesse" into one person. What I didn't realize until tonight, thanks entirely to Preston, is that I don't need to mesh together anything. I am who I am. My sexual preference really doesn't affect my personality in any way.  Another boy I've met recently is Matt! I met him only a few days ago via the gay youth website  urlLink http://www.xy.com . He's too adorable for words! Especially in the picture he has on his profile. He's holding a teddy bear and its just incredibly cute. He's very different from Brad, but in good ways. He's sorta intellectual. He likes poetry, and reading. We share a favorite animal in common, the penguin. We've talked on the phone for a little bit over the past two days and I know we'll become good friends at the least. I'm supposed to go over to his house this Thursday to hang out for a little while. I'm nervous, excited, happy, and anxious all at once about meeting him. He's a total sweetheart and I would hate to do/say something stupid to mess things up!  Now some of you are wondering who in the hell Preston is. Well, I'll enlighten you. About a month ago, well before I came out of the closet, I met this boy on Yahoo named Preston Warwick. Our whole relationship started one night when I stole his "Fuck You". I still wonder at how such a simple act of circumstance could start a chain of events to lead to me meeting the most amazing person I have ever known. He has done more to help me through all of this coming out and everything than anyone else. He's listened to my whining, my bullshit, my HORRIBLE SINGING. I can't begin to thank him enough for everything. All I can offer is my undying love. I love him. I love him like I've never loved anyone in my entire life. Now those of you who know me, know that I don't think too highly of online love. I believe its possible, and I also believe in a way it is more sincere than "in person" when it is real. When you can see, feel, touch someone then attraction has a physical aspect to it. When you cannot see someone then you fall in love with who that person is, not how well their skin hangs from their bones. Preston is the only person I have ever known that I could honestly say I can imagine myself spending the rest of my life with. Not saying I'm gonna be gay marrying anyone, but if I was going to marry anybody it would be him.  Wow, so now that you're sufficiently bored with listening to all my jibba jabba I'll let you be on your merry way. The Moral of the Story: This above all: to thine own self be true, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it must follow, as the night the day, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou canst not then be false to any man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!

      Hello boys and girls. I'll start this whole thing off by introducing myself. My name is Jesse. I'm sixteen years old and live in the great state of Louisiana. I just came home from a boys boarding school in British Columbia and am now pursuing a career in law. I have aspirations to a political career and would like to one day be President of the United States. (Republican, btw) My parents are divorced, and I haven't seen my father in almost a year. We stopped talking after he went insane and tried to harm my mom. Hm, I do believe that pretty much covers things. I hope you enjoy my little postings, and remember... Vote Smith/Tate for Election '24! =)

      My date with Bryan last night was a total disaster. We got to the movie and sat in the back row for obvious reasons. He was gorgeous and this only added to my attraction to his personality. I couldn't help myself and leaned over and kissed him. Two girls down in the front row of the theater noticed this. They proceeded to move from about 15 rows away to about 4 rows away. They were obviously confused by what they had seen, but I paid them no mind. We went about our business, and I, being Mr. Affection as usual, held Bryan's hand and snuggled and kissed. The girls began to giggle and say hurtful things. Finally things worsened, and they began to throw things at us. Bryan was becoming more and more uncomfortable every second, I could tell. They moved right up next to us and asked if we were gay. At this point, I was pissed, so I said, "Does this answer your question?" and gave Bryan a nice big deep kiss. They started throwing insults amongst other things again and I just continued doing what I was doing. After the movie they followed us out into the hall where Bryan just left me without even a goodbye. At this point I was hurt and pissed, and they kept bothering me. They followed everywhere I went and when I finally stopped proceeded to question me about my sexuality. I am patient and understanding to the utmost, and out of fear their questions being honest I answered them. They asked me about 8 or 9 things and I answered them all, even though each of my answers was followed up with some sort of comment about how disgusting I was. They said that it was pointless to be gay because I was hated by everyone and couldn't even get married. Eventually I lost my cool and told them I would go get a Cop if they didn't leave me the fuck alone... "There's no use in being gay. Everyone hates you fags. You can't even get married!" This summarizes it. I used to think gay marriage was a matter of gays wanting state recognized unions. I personally hate the fact the government has anything to do with marriage to begin with. Now, I personally will spend the rest of my life working in every way I can to make gay marriage a reality. It has nothing to do with wanting to be able to file joint taxes. ITS ABOUT RESPECT! Bush's constitutional amendment about only recognizing heterosexual marriages is just another way of the government pretending our love is just some sick sexual fetish. Its an official declaration that we are freaks and that cannot be allowed. For years we have been mistreated, slandered, misunderstood, and sometimes killed because we dont hide who we are and even in this so called "enlightened age" where we believe the human mind is no longer hindered by silly psychological barriers we are still treated like a side show. Governments, religions, and organizations across the world still think we are just something to point at and go, "HOW DIGUSTING!" Well how dare you judge us! The fact is, if anyone, gay or straight, had their sex life exposed to the public it would shock and horrify all of us! It is true we are more accepted now than we once were, but that doesn't mean we should stop fighting! So many gay boys just sit on their asses and watch others get ripped to shreds for who they are. UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL! We must fight together for a right more fundamental than any other. The Revolutionaries faught for the right to self-government. The black community fought for the right to be treated as equal. They are heralded as heroes. We, the gay community fight for something much more fundamental than any of this. We fight for the right to LOVE. Yet, we are treated as animals. To the United States Government: GET BACK TO THE BASICS ASSHOLES! "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are  LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE  PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS."   The Moral of the Story: "We must live together as brothers, or we will die together as fools".

      Well as you can see from my past few posts, alot of good things have happened and then gone awry recently. I've taken alot of time here in Boston to ponder over these various different "tragedies" and see where I went wrong and correct my mistakes in the future. They say that mistakes arent bad as long as you learn from them, and I do intend to learn from my mistakes. As with most matters of personal philosophy the various realizations that I've come to have sent a ripple effect through ever facet of my being and helped me to realize that, in the words of Dropkick Murphys, "I'm not half the man I thought I'd be". I have turned into the kind of person I always hoped I wouldnt and I do believe its time to change that. I hit this realization when I was riding through Harvard Square today. It reminded me of all the hopes and dreams I had for myself when I was a young boy and that I had lost sight of what is important in life. The way I've been handling relationships and my friends, and how I've been dealing with the various problems has been just horrible and thanks to my newly acquired talent for meditation I'm feeling much better focused on what is really important. So, if you notice a little bit of a chance, hopefully for the better, then you know where it came from. I know two boys (yes, it ALWAYS boils down to boys) that symbolize these two different directions I'm being pulled in. The first shall remain nameless. He is self-centered and thinks everyone else's life should revolve around his. He thinks everyone is in love with him and believes that because of that he can treat people however the fuck he wants with absolutely no concern for their feelings. Then, there's TJ. He is very honest and open. He always gives his opinion on things, and is never afraid to challenge me because I might get pissed and run away. He's bold and very different. We talk religion, politics, etc. and I've never met a boy that would give any of that a second thought. We're just friends at the moment, but I'm open to a relationship if the fates lead in such a direction *crosses fingers*. Before I begin my social commentary for this posting, I thought I'd mention something. Alot of people have been commenting on how much they like my writing recently and I appreciate it so much. Thank you for all of your support and I love you to death for it. Now for my rant of the day: This one is gonna be somewhat different than what you guys are used to. I've been talking about relationships and such, but today you get to hear some political commentary. "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights,  and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". How true is that today? The Government has fucked the working man so bad its not even funny and forget any compasssion on their part for all of his losses. The purpose of government is to ensure the health and happiness of the people of the nation and it has been over a hundred years since our government has taken any action to do such a thing. Elections have gone from a "let the best man win" situation to POLITICS. The word itself turns my stomach. What is politics? The science of decieving the masses into believing you are something you are not, or making them believe something they really dont want. Its time that America got back to its roots. Its time that someone stand up and say that they are running for election to SERVE THE PEOPLE, NOT TO SERVE BIG BUSINESS. We need someone who is more interested in preserving our way of life and less interested in financing a campaign riddled with empty promises and broken dreams. Someone who is willing to uphold the ideals symbolized by that sacred banner. GOD. DUTY. HONOR. COUNTRY. I met two boys yesterday, Bryan and Benji. They are both freshmen at Caddo Magnet High School and I must say are just amazing guys. I met Bryan first, he e-mailed me when he found my profile on a personals site and a week later I found the e-mail in an old inbox. Pure luck. He called me a little while later on Jason's cell phone and we talked for a couple of hours. Later that night I convinced him to call his friend Benji and got to talk to them both at the same time. I immediately liked these two little studs and we plan to meet up at Mall St. Vincent this Thursday unless my mom or brother decides to be assy.  The Moral of the Story: If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels,  but have not love,  I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.   And if I have prophetic powers,  and understand all mysteries and all knowledge,  and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains,  but have not love,  I am nothing.   If I give away all I have,  and if I deliver my body to be burned,  but have not love,  I gain nothing.   Love is patient and kind;  love is not jealous or boastful;  it is not arrogant or rude.   Love does not insist on its own way;  it is not irritable or resentful;  it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right.   Love bears all things,  believes all things,  hopes all things,  endures all things.   Love never ends;  as for prophecies, they will pass away;  as for tongues, they will cease;  as for knowledge, it will pass away.   For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect;  but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away.   When I was a child,  I spoke like a child,  I thought like a child,  I reasoned like a child;  when I became a man,  I gave up childish ways.   For now we see in a mirror dimly,  but then face to face.  Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully,  even as I have been fully understood.   So faith,  hope,  love  abide, these three;  but the greatest of these  is love.

      I'm in my second favorite city in the whole world. BOSTON! I'm up here in Bean Town visiting Jason for a week and its been interesting to say the least. The public transportation system here is like looking at a buffet of all the different varities of people. My favorite stop on the T thus far would have to be the South End because thats where all the hott gay boys get on. They're like the cream cheese won-tons... Anyways, we've probably spent the majority of our time riding on the green, red, and yellow lines and sitting in the Common, Jason playing with his sidekick and me talking to Brad and Preston while I drool over guys and scare the shit out of the squirrels. Jason has a feature on his uber-sidekick that lets him put people on a speakerphone thing, so the patrons of the Boston Common that evening got the privlege of listening to me and Preston fake phone sex as Jason walked through large crowds of people with his sidekick's speakers blazing. Today we went back up to Harvard so I could take some pictures, then pretty much road the T around until we had to head back to Jason's house to get dressed to go to his dad's country club. I must say that dinner at Brae Burn was the funnest meal I have had in a long time. In the course of the night's activities I was told by Jason's dad I could go to NYC today to meet the one... the only... my HERO... William Jefferson Clinton!!!!!!!!!! Jasons says he doesn't know for sure if it will actually happen. While we were at the country club Jason cut himself on a glass that he broke from squeezing it too hard and took a few napkins back to the car to stop the bleeding. Once we got back as he left the car he said, "Wait, lemme get my blood rag out of the car..." totally unaware this was a term used to describe tampons. Mia noticed and commented on how dirty Jason's vocab was. We also got to meet up with some friends/relatives of friends of Jason's at the Mall and I bought a round of Passion Herbal Tea Lemonades for everybody in Somerville. THEY WERE NASTY!!! At the other Starbucks they tasted just fine but good god these last ones were horrible. I was appauled at the nastiness of it all. I mean, wow, just awful. I've been making good use of Jason's webcam and alot of people have see me in motion for the first time and all the compliments were VERY MUCH appreciated. Thanks so much. You guys made for a major self esteem boost.  I have taken an interest in a couple of guys over the past few days. Three in particular have caught my fancy. The first is TJ. He goes to Capt. Shreve with Brad but is thinking of going to Magnet next year *crosses fingers*. We're gonna be meeting up for a movie sometime this week if all goes according to plan. I KNOW AUDREY I SHOULD BE DOING MY READING!!! BUT HES TOO CUTE TO PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY!!! He and I actually talk about meaningful stuff. Its not constant flirting like usual. I feel like we would go really well together because there would be actual conversation instead of just useless crap. Number two is Steven. He's older, but that's a good thing. More mature guys usually work out better for me. The best part is... HE HAS A CAR AND WILL DRIVE TO KEITHVILLE. So I can see him on a regular basis. In case you're reading this Steven, no I am not using you for your car. I'm only happy because it will allow me to see your sexy ass often =). Steven and I will also hopefully be meeting sometime this week if all goes according to plan. He's a musician too and has sent me a few clippings of songs he's working on. He's got real talent and creativity and I absolutely love them. I'm definately looking forward to meeting him and if I'm lucky, seeing those songs played for me in person. Number 3 is Sean. He's really far away but  absolutely incredible. He's got a wonderful personality and would have to be, by far, the sweetest guy I have ever met in my whole fucking life. He too is a little older, but like I said its a good thing. This guy is one of the hottest boys I have ever seen in my entire life. He could have any guy up in Pennsylvania he wants, but he is going to drive 2 fucking days halfway across the North American Continent to Louisiana just to see me. All I know to say is just WOW.  The moral of the story:  For Boston, for Boston we sing our proud refrain For Boston, for Boston 'tis wisdom's earthly fame For here all are one and our hearts are true And the towers on the heights reach the heavens' own blue For Boston, for Boston 'till the echoes ring again  For Boston, for Boston thy glory is our own For Boston, for Boston 'tis here thy truth is known And ever in the right shall our heirs be found 'Till time shall be no more and thy work is crowned For Boston, for Boston 'till the echoes ring again

      HA! The suckiness of it all! Everything I dedicate myself to always turns to shit for some odd reason. Perhaps I'm like Medusa, all that I gaze upon shall turn to shit! Oh well, its a curse and a... wait, no, just a curse! I'm a victim of circumstance apparently. Goddamn circumstance! For some reaosn, everytime I invest any amount of interest in a guy things always go wrong. Its been 5 weeks now since I came out and I am not pleased with the results at all. Brad, well... that's just confusing. Matt was a tragedy of biblical proportions. Now Drew has apparently found someone he cares for more than me. Well, I suppose the important thing is that he has  someone . Or perhaps the important thing is that I have no one? Well its 3:32 in the AM and I'm far too stoned from lack of sleep to think about something that complex. We're still friends, hopefully. I mean, you often hear that don't you? "But I still want to be friends..." How often does it actually happen? I still think he's incredible, and want him to be a part of my life, but I don't know if it will work out. I hope so. I'm not gonna lie, it hurts big time, but also feels sort of liberating. I had a few little epiphanies thanks to this little fiasco and now have a much more enlightened outlook on dating and life in general. I get myself far too attached far too quickly, and then something happens to snap me out of it and I wonder, "What the hell was i thinking?" The revelation about my feelings for Drew is moving into focus. He is so wonderful. This is true. An absolutely extraordinary guy! But the question is, did I really like  Drew ? Or did I like the idea of being with someone in the first place? I don't know Drew too well. I mean, we've known each other for 5 days and I was ready to do anything to make him happy and want me. What the hell caused that? It sure wasn't because I was in love with him. Not after 5 days. C'est impossible! The answer, dear friends, is INFATUATION. I like how he made me feel, and I liked the prospect of being with someone like him. But again, did I like him, or some vague notion of happiness that he represented? I think we should all ask ourselves this question before we get involved with someone. Do we love that person? or are we in love with being in love?  The Moral of the Story: Just because you love someone does not mean you have to be involved with them. Love is not a bandage to cover wounds.
