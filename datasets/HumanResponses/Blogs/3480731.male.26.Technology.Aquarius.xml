      Well, since I've had this space now all weekend, and I already have a few friends who are linking to it, I might as well put up something. The big problem is, what to put up. I've been looking through a selection of different Blogs and it seems that most people are rather creative. Sadly, I don't fall into that crowd. I'm the type of guy that cringes when asking what someone wants for birthday/Christmas and I'm told "Be creative.". Now, give me a list, I'm all smiles.  So, for about six hours before June 1st, you wouldn't know it here in Chicago if it wasn't for the calendar. It's 63 degrees out and it has been raining on and off for at least the past three weeks. Not that I don't mind it not being 85+ degrees, but this is just too much.  This seems pretty good for a first post; I'm shocked I came up with something. Now the real challenge; keeping it up.

       urlLink WWE Raw  - Live from Richmond Coliseum in Richmond, Virginia  Welcome to another Raw review. Let's get to it:  We start the show with a recap of the events leading up to the Triple H vs. Eugene match from last week. As always, nice video segments by the WWE production team.  The pyro hits and we're off and running.  JR and the King welcome us to a big night on Raw where we will see the Bad Blood rematch of  Kane vs. Chris Benoit  for the  World Heavyweight Championship  tonight. But before that, JR has been ordered by Eric Bishoff to interview Kane tonight. Bishoff has assured JR that there will be security around the ring to protect him in case Kane tries anything. Recall Kane set JR on fire a while back when he (Kane) was unmasked.  We cut to the ring as Evolution's music hits and all four members make their way to the ring. Triple H gets on the mic and informs us that he will be challenging the winner of the  Kane vs. Chris Benoit  match tonight at Vengeance. But, he isn't here to talk about that; he's here to talk about his match last week with Eugene. He goes over the events at the end of the match last week and then calls Eugene down to the ring. Eugene music hits and he makes his way slowly to the ring (he has a bandage with a smile on it where he was hit with the chair). Triple H explains to Eugene that he was rough on him last week to prepare him for other guys in the back that want to beat him up; like Chris Benoit who hit him with a steel chair. Eugene tells Triple H that Benoit apologized, but Triple H will have none of it and says only he will tell Eugene the truth; Benoit is a jerk. Eugene doesn't need Benoit, cause he has Evolution. So, tonight, Triple H is going to make Eugene an honorary member of Evolution. At this, the other members of Evolution start to look at each other and grumble.  William Regal then comes down to the ring and is trying to talk sense into Eugene about Evolution. Triple H then tells Eugene that Regal doesn't care about him...he only was helping Eugene to get his job back. Regal is forced to admit the truth. Triple H then rips into Regal how there is nothing lower than pretending to be Eugene's friend to get what he wants. Triple H then demands a choice from Eugene; Evolution or Regal.  Before he can answer, Eric Bishoff comes out onto the entrance ramp. He is not going to let Triple H pressure his nephew. If Triple H and Regal have a problem with each other, then they'll settle it in the ring tonight. But, for a match like that, you need a special referee. That ref will be none other than Eugene! Excellent segment to start Raw. Triple H playing the "friend" to Eugene is classic stuff; old school DX Triple H.  Before we go to break we find out that NEXT is the rematch from last week:   Match 1 - Chris Jericho & Edge vs. Randy Orton & Batista  - Jericho & Edge get the win when Edge hit a spear on Batista and Jericho followed it up with the Lionsault for the pin. Solid match for the 2nd week in a row from these four. It was nice to see them let this match run after using it last week as a way to make sure Jericho wouldn't be around to help Eugene. During the match, the fire alarm in the arena went off (no doubt from the mix of Jericho's and Edge's pyro) and the crowd was doing a Y2J chant to the beat of the alarm. There was also a big pop when the alarm finally went off. I know I was wondering what it was...I was making dinner and walking back and forth and heard that alarm and thought it was my smoke detector...  We get a recap video of last week's chapter of the Matt Hardy / Lita / Kane triangle. Quick update: Lita is pregnant, Matt proposed, and Kane interrupted and said the child is his. Lita couldn't deny it and is not sure whose the father.  Triple H and Ric Flair are back in Evolution's locker room and Flair is complimenting Triple H on his manipulation of Eugene. Triple H says that once he has the World Title back, Eugene goes bye-bye for good.  Raw Diva Search recap 1...  yawn  ...wake me when the show starts again...  Back to the locker rooms, where Lita is trying to reach Matt Hardy on the phone. She leaves him a message and then Stacy enters and asks Lita what she is going to do. Lita has no answer.  Back at ringside, the security for JR's interview with Kane is in place, so to the ring JR goes. Kane's pyro goes and he comes down to the ring with a smile on his face at the sight of JR. He informs JR that if he wanted to hurt him, no one could stop him. Unfazed, JR asks Kane why he attacked Shawn Michaels a few weeks back. Simple answer from Kane; Michaels was in his way, and when you're in Kane's way bad things happen. JR then asks about the situation with Lita. Kane has craved one thing, that is to have a normal life. That starts tonight when he beats Chris Benoit for the World Title. Then, in 8 months, he becomes a father. JR reminds Kane there is still a chance the child is Matt Hardy's. Kane starts to stalk JR. As he's about to attack, Matt Hardy comes out of the crowd and attacks Kane. Bishoff comes out onto the entrance ramp and orders the security to remove Matt Hardy from the building. He apologizes to Kane and, due to Benoit coming out to help Eugene last week, in tonight's  World Title  match Benoit can only win by making Kane submit. However, Kane can win the title by pin, submission, count out, or DQ.   Match 2 - William Regal vs. Triple H - Special Referee - Eugene  - Triple H wins by DQ when Eugene catches William Regal with Flair's brass knuckles. Not a very long match, but it was good to see Regal back in the ring. As the match goes on, Regal starts to get the upper hand, so Flair gets up on the apron to distract Eugene and tosses Triple H the knuckles. Regal punches Triple H and get the knuckles. Eugene turns around and sees Regal with the knuckles and calls for the bell.  Post match, Regal is trying to talk to Eugene and Triple H hits Regal from behind, bumping Regal into Eugene. Eugene thinks Regal attacked him, so he charges Regal and pounds him with a flurry of rights and lefts. It takes both Flair and Triple H to pull Eugene off Regal.  La Resistance come down to the ring and get on the mic and do their normal act to get the crowd mad at them.   Match 3 - Non Title - La Resistance vs. Rhyno & Sgt. Slaughter  - La Resistance picks up the win with their tag team finisher, now called the "Au Revoir". Sarge looked in great shape in this match and it's always great to see Rhyno in action on Raw. Did you here the pops for him, WWE? Push him. Decent match that kept the crowd alive and ready for the main event.  We come back from the break to find Triple H hyping up Eugene. He tells Eugene that Kane, Benoit, and even Regal were just pretending to be his friends and that he is part of Evolution now and NO ONE is ever going to hurt him again.  Raw Diva Search recap 2...zzzzZZZZzzzzZZZZ...Oh, the show is back on.  JR and the King run the card as it stands so far for Vengeance:   - World Heavyweight Championship  - Kane or Chris Benoit(c) (Depending on the outcome tonight) vs. Triple H   - Intercontinental Championship  - Randy Orton(c) vs. Edge  - Chris Jericho vs. Batista  Cut to Eric Bishoff's office where Ric Flair is talking with Eric Bishoff. As Flair leaves, in comes Coach. Bishoff informs Coach that while Bishoff is off on vacation next week, the interim GM for Raw will be...Eugene.  Up next, the main event!   Match 4 - World Heavyweight Championship - Chris Benoit(c) vs. Kane - Benoit can only retain by submission / Kane can win the title via pin, submission, count out, or DQ  - Chirs Benoit wins by making Kane submit in the Crippler Crossface to retain the  World Championship . A nice match that played off the stipulations well. More than once, Benoit went for a pin "out of instinct" and the ref would wave it off. There was also a moment where Benoit was outside the ring and Kane was "one second away" from winning the  World Title . The end saw Benoit going up to the top rope for a move and Kane caught him by the neck, ready for a chokeslam, but Benoit countered by dropping to the outside and hanging Kane's arm up on the top rope. This plus a shot to the pole was enough for Benoit to make Kane submit.   After the match, Kane attacks Benoit from behind and chokeslams him to hell. He signals for a Tombstone, but then Lita's music hits. She comes down the ramp with a big smile on her face. The crowd is very confused. She gets into the ring, grabs the World Title, and hands it to Kane. She then raises his hand. As he turns away from her, she gives him a low blow and grabs the belt, ready to hit him with it. Lita misses with the belt and Kane sets her up for a chokeslam. As he is about to do it, he realizes he can't; Lita is carrying his child. He lets her go, and she slides out of the ring. As he turns away from her, Benoit waffles Kane with the belt, much to Lita's delight.  We see Benoit holding the belt above his head as we fade to black.  Review - An ok edition of Raw. Not enough wrestling for my taste (only four matches). Also, did anyone else notice the only women on were Lita and Stacy, and Stacy didn't even go into the arena, she was backstage. Where are Trish and Victoria and Molly? Obviously I'm in the minority in my belief that the ladies have been busting their butts the past few months in the Women's Division. After looking at the Sunday Night Heat taping list, I see a few of them get to wrestle, but still...also it would have been nice to see the Sarge win right before the 4th of July. Maybe they are saving that for next week?

      Just saw  Chronicles Of Riddick  this past weekend, and I have to say I was very pleased. I was one of the few that saw  Pitch Black  when it first came out in 2000 and, like many, liked Vin Diesel's character Riddick. Beyond the fact that Riddick was a badass who seemed to be super human, he had what has now been dubbed in the new film "eyeshine". Eyeshine is what gives Riddick's eyes that blue glow. It allows him to see in total darkness; the darker it is, the better he sees. Of course, if he is in a bright place, he cannot see very well at all(which is why some pictures of him have him wearing his signature goggles). This all comes into play in  Pitch Black , when his ability to see in the dark is all that stands between the crash survivors and a squishy end.  I would highly recommend seeing  Chronicles Of Riddick ; especially if you're into action / adventure movies. Also, if you have the time and are inclined, check out  Pitch Black  before you see  Chronicles . There are a few characters and references to it in  Chronicles  and you can enjoy the film a bit more cause you'll be "in the know".   Yes, I do other things beyond watch wrestling and movies...but they are both two of my stronger passions and Blogs are about passions, correct? :)  "You're not scared of the dark, are you?"

       urlLink WWE Great American Bash  - Live from Scope Arena in Norfolk, Virginia  We start off with, as always, a nice video package hyping the main events for tonight; John Bradshaw Layfield vs Eddie Guerrero & The Dudley Boyz vs. The Undertaker. We cut to the ring and Torrie Wilson, it the outfit she has been in the past few weeks (Uncle Sam) welcomes us to The Great American Bash.  The pyro hits and we're into our first match.   Match 1 - United States Championship - Rob Van Dam vs. Rene Dupree vs. Booker T vs. John Cena(c) - Fatal Four Way Elimination Match  - John Cena wins via his finisher, the FU, to Booker T to retain the  United States Championship  after dodging Booker's Scissors Kick. A very solid match that left all four men looking strong. For once, thankfully, a heel in a match like this did the right thing. Booker T was outside the ring letting Cena and Van Dam beat each other. Order of elimination was: 1. Rob Van Dam by John Cena via rollup after Van Dam had hit Five Star Frog Splashes on both Booker T and Rene. Nice heads up pin by Cena. 2. Rene Dupree by Booker T after Cena hit Rene with an FU. Rene had the top rope to try and block the FU, but Booker kicked Rene's arm allowing Cena to hit the FU. As Cena turned around after the FU, Booker hit a Scissors Kick and then covered Rene. After eliminating Rene, he tried to cover Cena, but too much time had passed and Cena kicked out at two. A very good opening match that got the crowd going early, and they would need it...  Backstage, Charlie Haas and Miss Jackie are by the entrance to the backstage area. Cena comes by and they congratulate him. Cena made a comment to Miss Jackie regarding his "equipment" and leaves them both looking confused. On cue, up rolls Kurt Angle who rips into Haas for hanging with Cena. Haas tries to tell Kurt off, but Kurt will have none of it and books Haas tonight in a match with Luther Reigns.  Cut to the hot tub the Divas are hosting the PPV from. Sable is there and talks a bit about her match with Torrie later on...standard heel Diva interview. We head out to the ring for our next match...   Match 2 - Charlie Haas vs. Luther Reigns  - Luther Reigns wins with his current finisher, The Roll The Dice. Sadly, and I like Haas, but this match was nothing to get excited about. Standard strong man tosses the smaller guy around match. The feeling I have is that this match was made solely to get Miss Jackie out into the arena (I hope that isn't the case, but with how short it was and how much of a squash it was, it's hard not to think that).  Short interview with John Bradshaw Layfield. Pretty much the same things he has been saying all the time; Judgment Day win, this is more than personal, etc, etc.   Match 3 - Cruiserweight Championship - Chavo Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio(c)  - Rey Mysterio wins via countering the Gory Bomb (Chavo's finisher) into the snap sunset flip Rey uses to retain the  Cruiserweight Championship . This match was outstanding and should show the powers that be in the WWE writing and booking teams that if you give the cruiserweights the time to make a match, they will shine BIG TIME. This match had high flying, weardown, and told a great story (gotta love how Chavo was working on Rey's leg the whole match and how it showed when Rey would try and use his aerial offense). The spot of the match is a tie between when both men came off the top rope and slammed each other face first into the mat and the finish. It took a lot of work to make the counter to the Gory Bomb at the end look right, and both men did great.  Back to the hot tub where Torrie has Spike Dudley, Billy Kidman, and Funaki with her. All three of them are arguing over which one, if they were in Chavo's place, could have beaten Rey. Torrie stands up and is wearing a small bikini and that stops the argument. She excuses herself and heads off to get ready for her match tonight with Sable. Funaki watches her go and says "God Bless America". Two things, first, did Billy Kidman slap Funaki in the head after the cameras went off (Kidman and Torrie are married in real life, if you didn't know that...) just out of impulse. Second, why do people still hoot and holler for Torrie or Sable. Yes, they are nice looking ladies, but if you wanted to see them 100% naked, they have both been in Playboy. I guess for that part of the PPV, I wasn't the target audience...   Match 4 - Kenzo Suzuki vs. Billy Gunn  - This is where I question the WWE again. I have been at arenas where Billy Gunn comes out and the cheers that come over the TV are NOT fake. My girlfriend is not a full time fan and she likes Billy Gunn still from the days of the New Age Outlaws and DX. When SmackDown came to Chicago, she came with to see him. Sadly, he wasn't even in a dark match (sorry Kathy :( ). After all the hype for Kenzo, I have to say I'm disappointed so far. I was hoping for something great and when I first saw him come out on SmackDown, I got excited, "a big Japanese wrestler! This guy is going to rock.". Sadly, he has done nothing of the sort. Someone needs to remind him that this is 2004 and that no one buys the "iron claw" bit anymore. Also, the finisher he uses to beat Billy Gunn is a move Christian uses in matches ALL THE TIME. WWE either needs to rethink how this guy operates or not push him so hard at first. Oh - Kenzo Suzuki wins via a inverted DDT into a neckbreaker. The crowd was DEAD for this. At least they have been smart enough to put the slow matches between good ones, keeps the crowd awake.  Backstage, we see Paul Bearer tied up with Heyman walking around him doing what he does best; talking. Heyman says that the authorities think he is bluffing about the cement, but Bearer knows Heyman is not.   Match 5 - Sable vs Torrie Wilson  - Help me now...I know they tried hard, I know they work hard, but this was a trainwreak. As far as I had read, the original plan for the Bash was to have the Divas in summer contests (volleyball, swimsuit contest, etc) over the course of the show. Honestly, even if it would have been cheap thrills for the fans, that would most likely have been better than this. Both ladies tried hard, but the ending was SO BAD. They collided in the corner and Sable played that she was hurt and Torrie walking around the ring looking lost. Sable then grabbed her and rolled her up for the three count. Michael Cole and Tazz could be heard trying not to laugh about BOTH of Torrie's shoulders being off the mat, they even showed it in the replay.  Back at the Diva's hot tub. Dawn Marie is interviewing Rene Dupree about his loss earlier in the show. Rene plans to go protest. Good idea, you go do that. He then starts to hit on Dawn when the FBI (the FBI!? On a PPV!?) come by and Nunzio shows off his big feet and tries, and fails for a while, to get Dawn to understand why it is good to have big feet. Dawn goes off with Nunzio and Johnny the Bull looks over at Rene and INSULTS HIM. Could this be a push for the FBI or is Rene going to Velocity without passing Go or collecting $200?   Match 6 - Mordecai vs. Hardcore Holly  - Mordecai wins with his finisher, the Razor's Edge. Again, while I like Hardcore Holly, this match didn't feel like a PPV match to me. I felt like something I should see on SmackDown or Velocity. That being said both men worked hard, but the crowd was dead from the past two matches and this did nothing to wake them up.   Match 7 - WWE Championship - John Bradshaw Layfield vs. Eddie Guerrero(c)  - Texas Bull Rope Match - For those who don't know the rules, in a bull rope / leather strap match like this, the object is to beat your opponent up and then drag him around the ring with you and touch the four turnbuckles in succession. If you are stopped by your opponent, you have to start all over again. A new twist was put in by the WWE about if you take the rope off intentionally, you get DQed. My brother and I figured that would come into play, but it never did. The also had lights at the corners; green for Bradshaw (Tazz said it was for money) and red for Guerrero in case you couldn't keep track of it...A decent match over all with both guys working hard and your standard bull rope / strap match spots. Bradshaw got busted (hardway I think) by a chairshot from Eddie (it was in the same place outside the ring that Bradshaw busted Eddie open at Judgment Day last month). The other big spot of the match came when Bradshaw wrapped the rope around Eddie's neck and toss him off the top rope, to the outside and off the Spanish announce table. Of course, it didn't break, so Bradshaw then powerbombed Eddie through it. The end of the match saw both Eddie and Bradshaw with three lights each and Bradshaw reaching for the final one. Eddie rushed Bradshaw and jumped over him to hit the final turnbuckle. The ref awarded Eddie the match but then Kurt Angle came down and showed a replay of the end of the match. Bradshaw's back touch the turnbuckle before Eddie touched it so the winner, and  NEW WWE Champion , John Bradshaw Layfield.  I have no issue with Bradshaw getting the title, but I do have an issue with the end of this match.   MANY MANY   times in the WWE, we have seen replays where it is  OBVIOUS  that the wrong call was made, but " The referee's decision is final ". Also, on more than one occasion I've heard the announcers say " There's no instant replay in the WWE. ". SO, if that is the case, how does Angle have the right to come and do that, GM or not? Now, if the end had played out where Eddie when into Bradshaw and the ref called for the bell and then reversed the decision himself, I could deal with that. Yes, I know it's wrestling, yes I know it's scripted, but still, if you're going to set out rules and precedents, then stick to em. Now, there should be no reason why people can't call for an instant replay all the time...   Match 8 - The Dudley Boyz vs. The Undertaker - Concrete Crypt Match  - Undertaker wins with a chokeslam to Bubba and a tombstone piledriver to D-Von (gotta love the D-Von leg twitch, classic). Before the match started, we were shown Paul Bearer in his glass coffin. Heyman put on a little demonstration for Undertaker of what would happen unless he did "the right thing" and Heyman filled the coffin up to Bearer's ankles. Bubba then got on a mic and told Undertaker to do the right thing and lie down. After Undertaker did this, Bubba got over him and said he had been waiting for this for a long time. Undertaker then grabbed Bubba by the throat and the match was on. Standard fair from the Dudleys and Undertaker. As the match when on, Heyman got more confident and moved closer to the ring. After Undertaker got the win, Heyman started to head back for the switch to run the cement mixer when lightning hit it, knocking Heyman on his back. Undertaker then stalked Heyman, who, screaming like a little girl, ran into the back. After reaching the coffin, Undertaker did his kneeling bow to Paul Bearer. Undertaker then grabbed a mic and told Paul to rest in peace and   THREW THE HANDLE HIMSELF  . We fade to black as the cement covers Paul Bearer's head.  Review - As with most WWE PPVs lately,  urlLink The Great American Bash  had it's strong and weak points. The strong would be the title matches. All three of them told good stories and featured good wrestling / brawling (depending on the match). On the other side of the coin, I still think there are too many backstage interviews on PPV today. PPV is where the talking stops and the action starts. It's a place where all the smack that was talked is over and it's time to put it on the line. I understand pre and post match interviews, but not new storylines. We don't need that at the PPV. Also, a few of the matches seemed like overflow from Velocity and just took the air out of the crowd. It'll be interesting to see how things with the titles and with Undertaker go from here. How does he justify "killing" Paul Bearer? What will Kurt Angle try next to bring John Cena down? Where does Eddie Guerrero go from here? We'll find out this Thursday on SmackDown.

       urlLink WWE Bad Blood  - Live from The Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio  We start out with the classic WWE pre-PPV video. It hypes the two main events tonight; Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels - Hell in a Cell and Chris Benoit vs. Kane for the World Title.  The pyro flies and we're right into our first match.   Match 1 - World Tag Team Championship - La Résistance(c) vs. Chris Benoit & Edge  - Chris Benoit & Edge win by DQ due to Kane's interference, however La Résistance remain the  World Tag Team Champions . Benoit had Sylvan Grenier in the Crippler Crossface but Kane's pyro went off and Benoit released the hold. Kane then layed out both Benoit and Edge with big boots and chokeslams. Benoit was then tossed out of the ring and rammed into the ring stairs. Kane backed away up the ramp laughing as Chris Benoit was left in a heap ringside. Remember, Benoit has to fight Kane with the  World Title  on the line later tonight.  Backstage, we see Eric Bishoff and The Coach discussing Coach's match with Eugene scheduled for later tonight. Bishoff has barred William Regal from ringside so Coach has Eugene all to himself. They both then notice Eugene has overheard everything they said. Bishoff offers Eugene the opportunity to get out of the match with Coach if he quits wrestling tonight. Eugene, of course, chooses to wrestle.   Match 2 - Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko  - Chris Jericho wins with his current finisher; the step up Enziguri. The end saw Trish try to distract Jericho but Tomko ran into Trish and knocked her off the apron setting up for Jericho to hit the Enziguri for the win.  Backstage, Todd Grisham is interviewing Randy Orton regarding his match later tonight with Shelton Benjamin. The crowd is all over Orton and he takes exception to this and goes out into the arena with a mic and cameraman in tow. He goes on about how great he is and how long he has been the Intercontinental champion; his normal "respect me" speech. He is interrupted by Shelton Benjamin's music and Shelton makes his way to the ring. Shelton asks if Orton ever shuts up because no one want to hear what he's saying. He notices Orton is in his wrestling gear, and so is he, so lets have the match RIGHT NOW. Leads into...   Match 3 - Intercontinental Championship - Randy Orton(c) vs. Shelton Benjamin  - Randy Orton wins by rolling through a cross body off the top rope by Shelton and hooking the tights to retain the  Intercontinental Championship . One of the best moments of the night was when Ric Flair, having come down to "support" Randy Orton, got pulled into the ring and put in the figure four leglock by Shelton. While he had the move on Flair, Shelton rolled up Orton and ALMOST got the win. Very nice. I have a feeling where Orton's storyline is going...a match with Eugene.  Cut to the women's locker room and Lita is getting ready for the Fatal Four Way match for the  Women's Title . Matt Hardy comes by to wish her luck in the match. A knock on the door breaks up the moment as Eric Bishoff and a herd of security come in. Bishoff informs the couple that he is worried Matt will interfere in the  World Title  match tonight and he is here to remove him from the building. Matt at first refuses until Bishoff threatens to take Lita out of the  Women's Title  match if Matt doesn't comply. Matt wishes Lita luck and leaves with Bishoff and the herd.   Match 3 - Womens Championship - Victoria(c) vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus - Fatal Four Way (First Pin or Submission Wins Title)  - Trish Stratus wins by rolling up Lita after Lita hit Gail Kim with the snap DDT to become the  NEW Women's Champion . Nice work by all four ladies in this match and congrats to Trish for becoming the first five time Women's Champion.   Match 4 - Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman  - Eugene wins with a Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow (yes, you read that correctly). After the match, Garrison Cade tried to attack Eugene and got a Stone Cold Stunner (again, yes, you read that correctly) for his trouble. As Coach stumbled to his feet, he also got a Stunner. One odd point in the match was when a woman in a bikini came down with a tray of cookies and distracted Eugene (with the cookies). A few people I watch the events with said she looked a bit like Stacy Kiebler (the younger sister she mentioned recently...).   Match 5 - World Heavyweight Championship - Chris Benoit(c) vs. Kane  - Chris Benoit wins by rolling up Kane for the pin to retain the  World Championship . Many times in this match, we saw Chris Benoit going for his standard compliment of moves with them having little to no effect on Kane. More than once, Benoit tried to get the sharpshooter on Kane with no luck, then when he did get it locked in, Kane was able to struggle to the ropes after a LONG time. Kane hit a chokeslam late in the match, but Benoit kicked out. The ending saw Benoit hang onto Kane's arm when he tried to power out of a Crossface attempt and roll him up. A nice match that left both men looking strong.   Match 6 - Hell In A Cell - Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels  - Triple H wins via  THREE  Pedigrees! After hitting the third Pedigree they both collapsed and it took almost a minute for Triple H to put an arm over Michaels for the three count. Not much action with the cage in this (one of the first Hell In A Cell matches I can recall that had no action outside or on top of the cell) but there was a lot of bouncing off the walls of it. Triple H and Michaels beat the tar out of each other in this one. Some of the highlights:  - Triple H grabbing Michaels in a bear hug on the outside the alternating between smashing him into the ring post and the corner post of the cell over and over. - Two  NASTY  stair shots to Michaels by Triple H, which busted Michaels open. - Two equally as  NASTY  chair shots to Triple H by Michaels, which busted Triple H open (see the pattern?). - The look on Michaels' face when he found that ladder under the ring (they used the shot on Raw Monday night...I bet we'll be seeing that shot for a while). - Michaels dropping the elbow off the ladder onto Triple H while he was laid out on the table that Triple H had brought into the ring. The best part was when he got to the top of the ladder, he was at the roof of the cage, so he just fell and didn't jump, but still the same effect.  After the three count, Orton, Flair, and Batista come down to collect Triple H and they help him up the ramp. The ref helps Michaels up from the mat to cheers from the crowd. He waves to the crowd as we fade to black.  Review - A good PPV overall. The weakest match is probably a tie between Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman and Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko due to the fact that 1. Eugene matches are 90% story and 10% action (as they should be) and Tomko is still VERY green. If you see the replay, check him out falling before Jericho even gets close to him on the Enziguri. The match of the night had to be the Hell In A Cell. They went for an announced 47 minutes and 26 seconds. That is unreal. Kudos to them and to the whole brand for a great show.

      Well,  As you might have noticed, there was no  urlLink WWE SmackDown  review and there won’t be a  urlLink WWE Bad Blood  review till at least Monday or Tuesday. Some of you might have heard I was in a car accident on Wednesday. It wasn't too serious, but it's the first one I've been in since I started driving a little over two years ago. I was a bit shaken up, but the damage is minimal. It shook my confidence in my driving ability for a few days, but I'm pretty much better now (taking the Edens Expressway from Glenview into downtown then the Stevenson out to Midway will help the confidence level).   The hoot of the whole thing was that where the accident happened wasn't even a place I would normally be. I was coming back from jury duty in Rolling Meadows (I live in Forest Park, about 35 minutes away in good traffic), which I discover most people seem to get out of somehow. So, thanks to the Circuit Court of Cook County for this. Maybe I should send them a bill? ;)  Like I said, I'll get a Bad Blood review up tomorrow along with  urlLink WWE Raw  if I can. I'll also work on a SmackDown taping review since I'll be going to it at the  urlLink Allstate Arena  here in Chicago on Tuesday. I'll mark it accordingly so you can avoid it if you don't care for WWE or spoilers.  Need...Sleep. Night.

      WWE Raw - Live from Pepsi Arena in Albany, NY  We start the show with Stacy Kiebler coming down to ringside to push the $250,000 Raw Diva Search. After the plug, she demonstrates her "ring entrance". Gail Kim interrupts her, to the dismay of the crowd. Gail states that Stacy can show us how to be a Diva, but she is going to show us how to be the next Women's Champ. That leads us into our first match...   Match 1 - Lita vs. Gail Kim  - Lita wins with her new finisher since coming back; the snap DDT. A decent match with Lita selling the beating Gail gave to her leg and knee. Also, a very nice looking leg submission by Gail during this one.  Cut to Eric Bishoff's office, Johnny Nitro and The Coach are there at Mr. Bishoff's request. Bishoff makes a match for Badd Blood this Sunday of  Eugene versus The Coach . Nitro makes a joke at Bishoff's expense and gets booked in a match versus Eugene tonight that, if he loses, " YOU'RE FIRED! ".   Match 2 - Batista vs. Shelton Benjamin  - Batista wins with his finisher; the sit down powerbomb. A match to build for the  Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin  match this Sunday for the   Intercontinental Title . Orton cost Benjamin the match when he distracted both the ref and Benjamin long enough for Batista to hit a STIFF clothesline and the powerbomb for the win. Afterwards, Batista, Ric Flair, and Orton beat down Benjamin.  Cut to Edge and Chris Benoit backstage and they start to argue a bit about their  World Tag Team Titles  loss last week to La Résistance. The Coach interrupts them to inform Benoit that he has a match tonight versus BOTH members of La Résistance in a handicap match. Jump to Bishoff's office where Trish Stratus and Tyson Tomko get their wish:  Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko  at Badd Blood AND Jericho must wrestling tonight on Raw. Trish then makes the case that she beat Lita a few weeks ago and now Lita beat Gail Kim, so she should be the #1 contender for Victoria's  Women's Title . Before Bishoff can respond, Kane comes barging into the office and orders Trish and Tomko gone so he can talk to Bishoff alone.   Match 3 - Chris Jericho vs. A-Train  - Jericho wins with his submission move; the Walls of Jericho. Jericho had his ribs taped up to sell the beatings he's been getting from Tomko the past two weeks.  Triple H enters the Pepsi Arena and strides to the ring. He points to a skybox where he will sit and enjoy first hand watching Randy Orton take apart Shawn Michaels in the main event. He states he has never lost a Hell in a Cell match and while he knows he'll never go to heaven, he'll see Shawn Michaels this weekend in Hell.   Match 4 - Chris Benoit vs. La Résistance  - The match started as a two on one, but after a run in by Edge to save Benoit from a two man beating, Bishoff makes it a handicap tag match and gives La Résistance another partner; Kane!   Match 4.5 - Chris Benoit & Edge vs. La Résistance & Kane  - Kane wins with his finisher, the chokeslam, on Chris Benoit. This match was meant to show that both Benoit has a chance to get Kane in the Crippler Crossface and Kane can pin Benoit. Standard "Raw Before The Pay Per View" match.   Match 5 - Eugene vs. Johnny Nitro  - Eugene wins with a double ax handle off the top rope. Match had Eugene out wrestle Nitro many times. Coach and Eugene have a stare down / wave down which ends with Coach falling off of King and JR's announce booth.  Cut to Lita talking to Matt Hardy on her cell phone backstage. She mentions getting a  Women's Title  match at Badd Blood (excuse me?). As she gets off the phone, she turns into Kane. He says that he convinced Bishoff to add her to the match at Badd Blood. "I thought it was over,” she says. "I lied," Kane replies. O...k.  The King and JR run the card for Badd Blood:   - World Tag Team Championship  - La Résistance(c) vs. Chris Benoit & Edge   - World Heavyweight Championship - Chris Benoit(c) vs. Kane   - Intercontinental Championship  - Randy Orton(c) vs. Shelton Benjamin   - Women’s Championship  Fatal Four Way (First Pin or Submission Wins Title) - Victoria(c) vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus  - Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko  - Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman   - Hell In A Cell  - Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels   Match 6 - Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels  - Shawn Michaels wins via DQ when Batista comes down to the ring to attack Michaels as he is about to hit Orton with his finisher; Sweet Chin Music. Michaels turns the tide on them and lays them both out with a steel chair. He then works his way through the crowd to the skybox. We fade to black with Triple H and Shawn Michaels brawling in the skybox.  Review - An overall good show considering, as I said, that it's the show the Monday before a Pay Per View. Some strong matches that built towards the feuds going into this Sunday. I'm still not sure what to think of the Lita / Kane / Matt Hardy triangle. It keeps making me thing that Kane has no shot to win this Sunday since he has a "backup" story. Bump of the night was without a doubt the STIFF clothesline from Batista to Benjamin. Check back later in the week for my Badd Blood picks.

      I thought I might as well get this out of the way now; I'm a pro-wrestling fan, WWE in particular. I know I set myself up for a lot of abuse over this, but I've been into it since the mid 80s and as most fans say I "have the fever". I’ve decided that one of the things I can do here is give my two cents on the current stories and shows. I know there are a lot more feds out there, but I grew up on WWE, so that is what I'm going to cover. For those of you of the non-wrestling persuasion, I'll be sure to have posts pertaining to wrestling have "WWE" at the start of them, so you can just bypass them. Fair deal? :)  Working on my first WWE Raw review right now, hopefully I'll have it up tonight...

       urlLink WWE SmackDown  - Taped at the Winnipeg Arena in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada  The SmackDown review is back, late, but back! Tonight we'll have two titles on the line:  The Dudley Boys(c) vs. Billy Kidman & Paul London for the  WWE Tag Team Titles  & John Cena(c) vs. Booker T for the  United States Title   We start off with our opening contest:   Match 1 - Rob Van Dam vs. Mark Jindrak  - Rob Van Dam picks up the win with a split leg moonsault. Rene Dupree was ringside for commentary on this one. A good opening bout that got the crowd going early, and they would need it with some of the crap they are going to throw at us later. Interesting note that Theodore Long is no longer with Jindrak...hmmm...  Next we have a recap of JBL's celebration last week and his squash match with Spike Dudley. After the recap, we go to an interview with JBL. He states that he is going to defend his title this week as well. He also has a special opponent in mind; El Gran Luchadore, the champion of Mexico. Out comes El Gran Luchadore. He says a few works to JBL in Spanish and goes off. JBL offers to pay the masked man's medical bills after the match. Another good interview from JBL. I'll give them one thing, they have succeeded in making JBL into a great heel that the crowd HATES.   Match 2 - WWE Tag Team Championship - The Dudley Boys vs. Billy Kidman & Paul London  - In a shocker, Billy Kidman hit the Shooting Star Press on Bubba to make Billy Kidman & Paul London the  NEW WWE Tag Team Champions . I very solid match that saw Paul London finally come into his own. This match is EXACTLY how it should be done. Kidman & London started out early with some nice double team wrestling (did anyone else catch the double fist, very Rockers like). The tide then turned and the Dudleys got London isolated and pounded on him. The finish saw the Dudleys setup Kidman for the Wassup headbutt, but London pushed D'von off the top rope and Kidman reversed Bubba and London came off the top with the headbutt. Solid match, nice stuff, and CRUSIERWEIGHTS with a push! I'm a happy guy.  Backstage, Kidman & London are greeted by most of the faces in the locker room. As they make their way through the pack, they bump into the Dudleys, who look REALLY pissed. Finally, Bubba & D'von extend a hand to the new champs. Nice to see the Dudley's give the rub to the younger guys. I would guess at this point they are going to try and move the Dudley's away from Heyman (see later for more evidence).  Next we have an interview with Kenzo Suzuki. Very bland interview that seems to be setting him up to feud with John Cena. Am I the only one disappointed in this guy. I had read and heard good things, and he wrestles in super slow motion, even for the WWE. Ah well...  "So, you think you're untouchable..." John Cena hits the arena. He cuts a promo on Booker T and builds some hype for the title match later in the evening. Some nice stuff about Booker T being a Woopie Goldberg wannabe due to his dreadlocks. Then, Kenzo Suzki's music hits and he rushes the ring. Cena makes short work of the "Bronze Warrior" and tosses his out of the ring. While Cena is watching Suzki, Luther Reigns comes in and hits a variation on the Roll The Dice (swinging neckbreaker). He leaves Cena lying in the ring with the announcers wondering about Cena's condition for the title defense later tonight.  Match 3 - Champion vs. Champion - JBL vs. El Gran Luchadore - This match started out as a standard Bradshaw squash till El Gran Luchadore was tossed to the outside. Then, ANOTHER El Gran Luchadore came out from under the ring on the other side, tossed JBL out, placed a banana peel in the ring, and then went back under the ring. The ref found the peel and both he and JBL looked confused. While this was going on, the two El Gran Luchadores switch. JBL went out and got the new El Gran Luchadore and tossed him back in. Suddenly, El Gran Luchadore is fighting back...he knocks JBL down and starts to strut in a very familiar fashion. Then he hits the Three Amigos and goes for the Frog Splash. JBL wants none of it and gets out of the ring and heads for the back. El Gran Luchadore gets on the mic and informs us that he is good friends with Eddie Guerrero and next week, he is going to enjoy watching Eddie take JBL out in the steel cage. A nice segment, but it pretty much seals the fact that Eddie will lose next week.  Backstage, Josh Matthews interviews Booker T who says he is going to make Cena pay for what he said earlier and take the  United States Title . He also feels it's a shame Cena got attacked earlier; now Cena has an excuse when he beats him.  In the locker room, Bubba & D'von confront Spike again and offer their help in his match tonight. Spike tells them he didn't want their help and advice when they were Tag Team Champions, why would he want it now.   Match 4 - Six Man Tag - Chavo Guerrero, Akio, and Jamie Noble vs. Spike Dudley, Scotty 2 Hotty,and Rey Mysterio  - Jamie Noble wins it for his team when he hits Spike with his finisher, the Tiger Driver. VERY nice match with a lot of great crusierweight action. WWE?! DID YOU SEE HOW GOOD THIS WAS?! GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO SHINE!  Backstage, Josh Matthews catches up with Paul Heyman and asks how he feels about the Dudleys losing the  Tag Team Titles . Heyman could care less about the Dudleys right now...he has the Undertaker to deal with. What he has to say, he has to say in the ring, and off he goes.  Paul Heyman enters the ring and reads a prepared statement to the Undertaker (yes, he had it written down, he even "lost his place" once, great stuff...). He says that he doesn't deserve what the Undertaker has in mind for him. It was Bubba & D'von's idea to do that to Paul Bearer, not Paul Heyman. He offers to return the Undertaker's property; the urn; in exchange for mercy. He knows Undertaker does what he says, but he asks him to "let this one slide.". Heyman leaves the urn and the letter in the ring and walks away...Taker never shows.   Match 5 - United States Championship - John Cena(c) vs. Booker T  - Before the match could start, GM Kurt Angle and Luther Reigns came down to watch the match. Both men gave a solid effort. People say Cena isn't very good in the ring, but I disagree. Every week he works hard and entertains the crowd...last I checked, that's the job he has; sports entertainer. During the match, the action spilled to the outside in from of Angle and Reigns. Cena went to clothesline Booker and Booker ducked. Cena when right into Angle and knocked him out of the wheelchair. Reigns tried to attack Cena, but Cena got Angle's cane and attacked Reigns with it. Back in the ring, Cena goes for the F-U and hits it, but before he can cover Booker, Reigns hits the ring for the DQ. Angle calls Reigns off and tells him to get the  US Title Belt . Angle says he warned Cena not to lay a hand on him or he would pay. Angle then   STRIPS   Cena of the  US Title . The title is now vacant as we fade to black...  Review - A solid show that built off of the groundwork they have laid since the  urlLink Great American Bash . I especially like the focus on the crusierweights (two of them won the  Tag Titles !) and they got decent airtime. I hope it keeps up. I'm also looking forward to the cage match next week. The real question is the  US Title . I can only see three paths here:  1. Angle sets up a tournament for the title that'll end at SummerSlam. He would, of course, stack the deck against Cena, but Cena would still get in. I don't think I'd put the belt back on him at SS, though.  2. Angle gets overturned by the Board of Directors and has to put the title back on Cena; along with an apology.  3. (NOT WHAT I WANT TO SEE) Angle puts the belt on a champ of his choosing. Sadly, this will either be Rene Dupree or Kenzo Suzuki. Kenzo said "Got Bless America" at the end of his promo, so that scares me. Dupree deserves a title run, but not one handed to him. I guess we'll have to wait and see for ourselves...  I'll hopefully have a  urlLink Vengeance  review up before or after  urlLink Raw  tonight, with a Raw review to follow.  Take care.

       urlLink WWE Raw  - Live from Winnipeg Arena in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada  Welcome to this week's Raw Review. A happy 4th of July weekend to all my fellow US readers and a hello to any outside the US. We got a lot to cover, including the full card (as it stands now) for Vengeance this Sunday, so let's get to it:  We were promised a surprise by JR at the 7:45pm (central time) break in, and after the pyro, we see six chairs in the ring along with Tyson Tomko, the King, Tajiri, The Coach, and Stacy Keibler. Ric Flair's music hits and he makes his way down to the ring. Then the arena explodes as Chris Jericho makes his way to the ring. After all seven superstars are in the ring, Eugene, our acting GM for the night, comes out onto the stage. He reminds everyone that his Uncle Eric wont be here tonight but left him in charge (he's even got a sport coat on). He wants everyone to have fun tonight and asks the crowd if they want to see a title match. Of course they do, so Eugene books:   Match 1 - Tajiri vs. Tyson Tomko vs. Jerry Lawler vs. The Coach vs. Stacy Keibler vs. Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho - Musical Chairs -  Yes, you read that right, musical chairs. Eugene calls for the music to start and only Stacy is walking around the chairs. After a moment, the King starts to follow Stacy around the chairs. The music stops and they both take a seat. After a heartbeat, all the others dash for chairs. Tajiri is left standing and is eliminated. Coach finds this amusing and starts laughing at Tajiri and this buys him the green mist in the face. Pull one chair, and the music starts again. The other four superstars start around the chairs while Coach stumbles around the ring. When the music stops, everyone sits, including Coach who sits down right on the mat. Coach is eliminated. Pull another chair and the music starts again. When the music stops, everyone gets a seat but the King who sits on Stacy's lap, getting a cheer from the crowd. Pull another chair and hit the music. As they start around again, Ric Flair is doing his strut. As the music stops, he pushes Stacy down and she is left without a chair and is eliminated. The crowd boos till Stacy leaves the ring, and that makes them happy again. Down to three, another chair gone. Flair continues his strut in the next round, but gets too into it, loses track of the music, and is eliminated. We're down to two; Chris Jericho and Tyson Tomko. One chair left...they start around the chair and as the music stops Jericho pulls the chair out from under Tomko, nails him with it, and then sits down. Jericho wins the game of musical chairs.  Eugene declares Jericho the winner and announces tonight, in that very ring, it will be  Chris Jericho vs. Randy Orton  with the  Intercontinental Title  on the line! Jericho plays to the crowd and throws a few armbands to the crowd.   Match 2 - Non Title - La Resistance vs. Rhyno & Val Venis -  La Resistance picks up the win when they hit Val Venis with the Au Revoir. Interesting to see that a Canada crowd outside Quebec didn't take to La Resistance. Standard tag match here. It seems they are setting up for Rhyno to find a new tag partner...maybe for a debut at Vengeance this Sunday?  We cut to backstage where Randy Orton is complaining to Ric Flair and Batista about Triple H making Eugene a honorary member of Evolution last week. They are headed to Eugene's office because Orton doesn't feel it's fair he has to defend the  Intercontinental Title  tonight against Chris Jericho and then again Sunday at Vengeance against Edge. As they are walking, we see a sign behind them pointing towards Eugene's office. They stop, shocked at something off camera. We pan to see Eugene office; a moon jump (you know, those inflated things kids jump in at picnics?). Eugene sees Evolution and comes rolling (literally) out of his office. He is happy to see them and reminds them of how Triple H said now that Eugene is a member of Evolution, no one will hurt him. So, tonight, it'll be  Batista vs. Kane . He also makes a match for Vengeance for the  World Tag Team Championship ...La Resistance will take on the team of Ric Flair and....Eugene gets distracted by his wrestling guys and starts to play. Flair gets upset and presses Eugene for an answer, who is his tag partner for Vengeance? Eugene! Eugene goes back into his office and it takes both Batista and Orton to keep Flair from killing Eugene.  Cut to the ring where Triple H is making his way to the ring. Triple H cuts a decent promo stating that on Sunday he's going to answer the age old question; God or Evolution when he beats Chris Benoit for the  World Title . The "You Tapped Out" chants start and Triple H states that no man, woman, or god can stop him.  "You think you know me..." Edge comes out to interrupt The Game. Edge says that in the year he was out, he watched Evolution dominate Raw. In the time he's been back, not much has changed, but that is going to stop. He sends a message to Randy Orton that, regardless of if he beats Jericho tonight or not, at Vengeance he's his. He then tells "Hunter" to listen real close. The rest of them are going down too. One by one, they are all going to fall to Edge. Triple H just stares at Edge, he then takes off his jacket and tells Edge that all he said sounds great, but he's heard it all before from MANY guys; Foley, Austin, Michaels, Benoit; they all say the same thing. What makes Edge any different? Edge answers by lying right hands into Triple H. As Evolution comes down to make the save, Edge ducks out and over the rail. Orton tries to give chase, but gets a stiff right hand for it. Edge makes his way to the back through the crowd. In the ring, Triple H is irate, yelling after Edge.   Match 3 - Kane vs. Batista -  This went to a no contest when Matt Hardy came down and rammed Kane into the steel stairs five to seven times.   After the match, Todd Grisham catches up with Matt Hardy and informs Matt (and us) that his match with Kane at Vengeance is now a no DQ match. Matt asks if Todd saw what he did to Kane out there and says it's just a sample of what awaits Kane. Brave words, but when you get Kane mad to this level, he will snap you in two. Todd tries to ask some questions about Lita, but Matt will not answer them. The  Intercontinental Title  is on the line next!   Match 4 - Intercontinental Championship - Randy Orton(c) vs. Chris Jericho  - Randy Orton wins by rolling up Jericho and using the ropes after the distraction by Batista to retain the  Intercontinental Championship . This was a solid match that the crowd was 100% into (especially high number of Y2J chants, it is his hometown, after all) and they deserved a better ending. Even if it was Orton winning clean with the RKO. Jericho had Orton beat in the middle of the ring with The Walls of Jericho and he let it go to chase Batista off the apron (who had come down half-way into the match). Jericho got his mouth busted open at a point in this one. Obvious heat setup for the  Chris Jericho vs. Batista  match on Sunday.  Backstage, Triple H is in Eugene office (this was a great shot..."Do...We...Have...A...Deal...Eugene?") and meets Ric Flair outside. Flair wants to know if Triple H got him out of the match with Eugene as his partner this Sunday. He says it never came up, but he did get what he wanted tonight; the first step in getting the World Title back. In the main even tonight, it will be Chris Benoit & Edge vs. Triple H, Ric Flair, & Eugene in a 2 vs. 3 handicap tag team match.  SmackDown Rebound - This Thursday see John Cena defend the United States Championship against Booker T. Should be a solid match there, if they give it time.  We come back to the arena to the sound of Victoria's music to find we have what looks like a triple threat women's match.   Match 5 - Nidia vs. Victoria vs. Molly Holly - Contract On A Pole Match -  Nidia retrieves the contract and gets a Women's Title match in the near future. Decent stuff from the ladies. This kind of a match is hard to get any type of momentum going in. The shot of the match was the stiff kick from Victoria to Nidia while Nidia was on the top rope.  After the match, Trish and Tyson Tomko hit the ring. Trish has a cast on her arm from a "shattered wrist" (Trish does have a legit hand injury). She congratulates Nidia for her win and informs her that her title match is RIGHT NOW and SMACKS her with the cast, knocking her out. Trish then orders the ref to ring the bell and start the match.   Match 6 - Women's Championship - Trish Stratus(c) vs. Nidia -  Trish wins by covering the lifeless Nidia. NICE heel heat for Trish here. Could be a setup for a match at Vengeance.  Raw Diva Search Update = Some time for GrzeTim to get the laundry from the dryer. At least they got the idea and have the semi-finals on after SmackDown on Thursday. At least then the folks who want to watch it can watch it. I know for a fact I am in the minority in this. My neighbor from upstairs was down borrowing my vacuum on Monday and was there when this started and stayed though the bikini segment and then left once Trish and Lita were done (see below). I guess I just wish for more than eye-candy. Don't get me wrong, the ladies of the WWE are lovely, but I like seeing them mix it up too (cause many of them can very well)...sorry...end rant.  We come back to the arena and JR & King run down the card for this Sunday at Vengeance:  Chris Jericho vs. Batista  Kane vs. Matt Hardy - No DQ   Intercontinental Championship  - Randy Orton(c) vs. Edge   World Tag Team Championship  - La Resistance(c) vs. Ric Flair & Eugene   World Heavyweight Championship  - Chris Benoit(c) vs. Triple H  Backstage, Trish and Tomko run into Lita. Trish feigns concern for Lita being pregnant. As she walks away, Trish comments "and to think...they call me a slut.". OUCH!  Cut to outside Eugene office, where Triple H is giving him a pep talk for the main even, which is NEXT.   Match 7 - Chris Benoit & Edge vs. Triple H, Ric Flair, & Eugene -  Triple H, Ric Flair, & Eugene win after Eugene uses a chair on Benoit while the ref is down to break up a Sharpshooter on Triple H. Triple H then hits the Pedigree for the win. This match was ALL about playing up how Triple H has been using Eugene. Twice in the match, Eugene was lured into attacking Edge or Benoit. Seeing Eugene chain wrestle with Benoit at the start was a treat. I don't think we got to see Edge and Eugene at all. Eugene didn't want to hit Benoit with the chair but Triple H was screaming about how Benoit was hurting him. As we fade to black, you could see Eugene saying "I didn't want to do that...".  Review - A good buildup show for the PPV this weekend. Not much in the line of "new" storyline, but that's what next week is for. This week, as it should have been, was "sell the PPV". They did that, and I respect that. I expect at least one more match to be added to the card either on WWE Experience this Sunday morning or on Heat before the PPV. Have to wait and see on that, but my guess would be either Nidia vs. Trish for the title or a four way with the three ladies from the pole match and Trish. The 2nd makes more sense cause they can protect Trish depending on how hurt her hand is. Not that she needs it, but she is one of their "A" talents.   See you later in the week for SmackDown & Vengeance!

       Raw was pretty good this week save for a few glaring things.  The Diva Search is getting on my nerves big time now. It is sad how this is taking all the current ladies on Raw off and either putting them on Heat or off the air all together, however, the idea for the dodge ball game is a GREAT idea. It will be: Trish Stratus, Molly Holly, Gail Kim, Jazz, Victoria, Nidia, and Stacey vs. The 7 Diva Finalist in Diva Dodgeball. My only hope here is this is some payoff for the fans to see the real Divas wipe the floor with these wannabes. If the WWE feeds their current ladies to these rejects from a wet t-shirt contest, they are out of their minds.  I love the stuff with Eugene / Triple H / William Regal. A lot of people didn't know about the history between Regal and Triple H and it helped to make this more heated. This story has brought the old, vile Triple H out and I LIKE IT. Triple H sends another message to Eugene by beating Regal for the 2nd week in a row. The match this Sunday should be something to see.  A lot of people have frowned on the Kane / Lita / Matt Hardy story arch, and I can see the reason why. We get the classic contract signing, with Matt beating down Kane after the deal is inked. Lita told Matt right before this that the baby is Kane's. This plays right into my idea, follow me here: This Sunday in the match, Matt has Kane beat. Lita comes down and is all excited; jumping up and down. Suddenly, she clutches her stomach and falls over in pain. Matt, concerned for Lita and the baby that isn't even his, starts to head to help her. As he is looking at Lita, Kane rises and defeats Matt. Lita "recovers" and looks on in shock. Kane starts up the ramp, laughing all the way. Lita gets in the ring and start to console Matt. Suddenly, low blow, twist of fate by Lita. She laughs and runs up to Kane and they leave together. It was all a game; the stalking, the deal, even the child, it's all been lies to get back at Matt for what he did to Lita when she came back (recall he dumped her). Comments?  Outstanding match from Edge and Jericho. Too bad they couldn't have this match at SummerSlam...The announcers tried to convince us if the match is this good now, what will it be like when you add Batista. Don't get me wrong, I am starting to like Batista more and more now, but getting a three way to have the pace this match did will be a big challenge.  Rhyno & Tajiri and La Résistance continued their dance towards each other. Could we see a title match Sunday? Maybe, if there is time on the card (which is pretty full now).  Nice main event with Benoit taking on both Triple H and Orton (Eugene was back at the hotel with Regal after his beating). Benoit would hold his own for a while, but 3/4 of Evolution got the best of him. Eugene came down to make the save and we are treated to Eugene beating the tar out of Ric Flair and Orton as we fade to black.  A solid show, built to promote SummerSlam. Fingers crossed for this Sunday. SS is usually what sets the tone for the fall. Hope for good things.  Later peeps (a little Christian there for ya...God I miss Christian)

      Hello all,  Sorry for not being around as of late, but the world has been kicking my butt. I'm doing fine, but just busy, busy, busy. Due to that, I've come to a decision: no more full reviews. I'm going to just do notes and thoughts from the wrestling shows and try to do more non-wrestling related posts. So, no time like the present. I recently saw The Village. It was good and if you like M Night's work, you'll be happy, but there is one problem; if you're good at figuring out his movies, you'll have this one pegged by the midpoint. This still doesn't detract from the movie, but it kills the "shock" at the end. Still, I recommend it to anyone who cares for suspense movies. Excellent date movie.  On the other end of the world, I got Mega Man - Anniversary Collection for the GameCube. What can I say? Mega Man 1-8 and the two Japanese Arcade games as unlockables. This was a trip back for me. Mega Man 1 is still hard as hell and Mega Man 3 is still a masterpiece that Capcom should be proud of. The best part? Mega Man 7 and 8 that I never got to play (7 was hard to find and 8 was for the PlayStation, which I never had). Good times.  I order Madden 2005 for the X-Box yesterday. I'm taking a risk here; never tried a Madden game before, but I have ready SO MANY good things about the series. I have played NFL Fever 2003 and liked it, so Madden should be good for me.  Check back later this week for my SummerSlam predictions.
