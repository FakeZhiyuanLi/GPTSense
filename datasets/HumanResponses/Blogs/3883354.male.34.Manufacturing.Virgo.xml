      I went to the concert yesterday in the park. &nbsp; The Montreal Symphonic Orchestra played some music. Grieg, Haendel, even some gospel with a little choir. &nbsp; Really annoying choir director, but I wasn't there for the singing loony. &nbsp; It really drove home how much I miss music, and what a mistake it was to give it up.&nbsp; I need to get back into it, now that Sylvia's no longer there to be offended by the repetitiveness of practice. &nbsp; It sucks that my kids were denied music. They have a glimmer of talent. &nbsp; Well. That's it. Between the keyboard, the guitar, the singing in the choir and the drum set I'm definitely getting as soon as I pay off some debt, I should be good to get back my old passion. &nbsp; Maybe I can start a little jazz band, once I have all the stuff set up...

      Weird thing today. &nbsp; I went over to my ex's, took them all to Wendy's. I wanted to take everyone to a movie, but the kids just wouldn't have it. Well, mostly my older one. &nbsp; She just wanted to go home. &nbsp; I got to see them for about half an hour, then it's "see ya". &nbsp; The alternative would have been to go back to her place, and end up talking to her while the kids get on the PS2 and ignore me. &nbsp; Not like I don't want to talk to Sylvia, it's just that I still resent the separation and what it's done to myself and the kids, so I'm bitter, and not much fun for anyone, including myself when I'm around her. &nbsp; It's hard to believe it's only been 3 weeks. I feels like an eternity. &nbsp; 3 weeks and it's already half an hour, then "see ya". Doesn't give me much hope for next year. &nbsp; Maybe I'm overreacting, but screw it. I makes me feel like crap, so I have a problem with it.

       urlLink Phrasebase   Yeah. Phrasebase Rocks.  I get to teach Romanian, English, or French, depending on the day and time. Webcam chat is cool too, I guess.  I met some needy people there, but I guess that's what I was looking for.  I miss my kids and I miss my ex.  Well. I mostly miss my kids.

      I've heard about this blogging thing. What a stupid idea!  Why would I want to share my innermost thoughts with the masses? No way!  ----------  Hmmm. Blogging again. I can't understand why people do this. Look. This guy's learning to play the nose flute. I don't give a @#$%.  ----------  More blogging. Yikes. She needs serious psychiatric help.  I'll bet if I had a Blog, people would say that about me.  ----------  Well, this one looks interesting.  She's into Celtic music and wicca. That's cool. You know, this is like finding out everything about a person before you stumble across it on your first date.  ----------  Neat Google toolbar. What's this B button here do? Doh! More blogging. Hmmm. Free signup. Oh, what the hell. So what if people get to read my "diary"? Serves them right if they're nosey.  I'll do it.
