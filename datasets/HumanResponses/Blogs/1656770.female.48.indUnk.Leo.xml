      Well, today I decided to pamper myself a wee bit after having a very stressful day yesterday and stayed in my bedroom relaxing, watching tv, had grapes, Slim Jims and Ritz crackers to snack on and just relaxed. Even took a nap!  Then, I got tired of the pampering and decided to come online and do some work. My dear, close friend Barry is keeping me company and we're chatting as I do this. We talk often.... and I enjoy his company very much.  I watched the news and would like to ask Simon, the baseball player, 'what in the hay were you thinking' when you decided to use a team mascot for batting practice? IMHO (in my humble opinion) your fine of $432.00 wasn't enough, neither was getting just an apology and yeah, right.... as if the mascot wants two sign BASEBALL BATS from you!!! You should be fined by the team by sitting out a few games WITHOUT pay and pay a fine of about $5000.00 to go into a charity that helps the abused. You're out there in the public limelight, and like it or not, you are held to a higher standard of ethics and morality because the youth can be and are susceptible to what you do & say because you're a role model. So PLEASE, THINK before you act....next time.  And Barry...... *BIGFOOKINHUGS*

      Well Spike Lee, you had my support until yesterday! That's when it all changed! You were an example for all men to follow when you sued TNN for wanting to use your name, for their new image "Spiked TV". You said that you didn't want to have your name associated with anything promoting "man" shows such as Bay Watch and others like it. I was impressed.....then. Thought 'Hey! There's a man who respects women and setting an honorable example for our young men of today!'.....and believe me, today it's a hard pressed find to find men like this. But then you went and made a "settlement" with TNN AFTER winning your court case where they wouldn't be able to use your name. Makes one think that maybe your original act wasn't so honorable after all! Just maybe you sued so that you could settle with them after winning. So Spike Lee, how much was your honor worth, huh? And what else do you have for sale?

      A lot of things have been on my mind and I feel the need to write about them. First, I had to have a family pet, Napolean Bone-a-part put down because of kidney failure.  :-( He was 13 years 4 months old and will be missed very much!!!! Rest in Peace, Polie.  Second, my blood sugar will not adjust into the normal range. Most times, it's between 190 and 379. Averaging about 225. I have been accepted to the VA clinic in Saco about 25 minutes away so I no longer have to ride to Togus VA hospital, an hour and a half ride away. But now, I have to start all over again with a new health care person and am not looking forward to having to explain my health history (28 years of it) with her. :-( So, it's a mixed blessing, I guess.  Third, I have a new companion, Prince Strongbow. He's a Ragdoll cat and is the apple of my eye! He's a delightful rascal and full of love and life! I have a page up about him, check out the link on my Welcome to Debby's Homepage.  And lastly, for now, I've finally made the last payment on a parcel of land on route 4 for my trucking business on the 3rd of this month! It is now mine, free and clear and I'm very much relieved as now I only have to put my attention to my business and getting it running smoothly. Hopefully, it won't take long to do!

      The creation of this journal hopefully will give you, the reader, a small peek at who is The Dweller There Within Mm. First, here's the full poem I wrote:  The Dweller There Within by Debby Peare ----------------------------- There is the worldly face you see, that which I show and want me to be. Not until you've traveled where I've been, might you see the dweller there within.  That which lies far beneath and shows a deep, dark rushing river that flows from a mysterious dark pool where it does begin, where you might glimpse the dweller there within.  Where the truth, dark and light shimmers, mirrored in the pool, hints of it glimmers.  Looking carefully deep inside you might win some knowledge of the dweller there within.  You must travel within my mysterious world, where my secrets lay deep in waters swirled. Where the total truth can be seen and only then, can you start to know the dweller there within.  ------------------------------------------------------------ I'm a poet/writer and have been told I'm pretty good.  Have had a few things published and I feel pretty good at sharing my work, so maybe they're right! :-)  To speak about the posting of a dear and close friend, I feel the need to explain something. First, to me, it was a very stimulating conversation/discussion of our views on politics and laws. I think two intelligent, caring and close friends CAN have such a discussion as long as each respects the other's beliefs and opinions and that each has the right to a differing of such.  I, in no way, even thought, much less said, that my friend's opinion was anything racist, outdated or backwards and if my replies or questions implied that, then I truly apologize for the wrong message I imparted. Second, my intent was to point out that I feel that the government has NO business being in any consenting adult's bedroom and that the law in Texas (and every where else in the USA like it) was wrong and that the Supreme Court's decision was a correct one. I felt that the law was discrimative against ANY adult to enjoy pleasure in their own bedroom the way they deem fit without it being a crime as long as it is a consenting act between the parties. The government has no right to be there, period. Many laws have been changed since our fore fathers wrote the constitution & bill of rights, such as equality based upon sex, race and color..... the women's right to vote, the right to each being free from slavery and the abolition of seperatism and discrimination against minorities for example. Our fore fathers didn't address these things per se and each state, in their attempt to do so, passed laws based upon the morality of the majority, which is done all the time. But it still doesn't make it RIGHT. When these laws attempt to direct a people (consenting adults) to what they can do sexually, in the privacy of their own homes, as to how other's morality think it should be, then IMHO (in my humble opinion), it is wrong and in violation of our God/dess given and constitutional right of freedom. You can and have the absolute right to disagree with different sexual lifestyles due to your moral standards and not apply them to your life, but no one has the right to force their sexual moral standards onto other consenting adults, much less make it a law. The LAWS pertaining to how consenting adults can sexually express themselves in the privacy of their own bedrooms is outdated and discrimatory and should be abolished, IMHO. It is also everyone else's right to the same freedom to have their own moral standards (even if it is different) granted by the constitution of the USA.  It's the LAW that is outdated my friend, NOT your opinion or morals. I happen to like your morals and find them in accordance with mine. We only differ in HOW the law should ( or should not IMHO) address it, t'is all!

      I've been wanting to create this journal for some time now and finally stopped my procrastination today. The catalyst of this creation was a posting of a very dear and close friend of mine in his blogger (told you that you're good for me! :-) ). Right now, I'm setting this up and will post in a wee bit.

      I would like to ask to anyone who may care..... what has become of our society's morals that they are now bass-ackwards? I saw a pilot commericial for an upcoming show and a woman walked on from stage left with her middle finger extended.... and the finger was edited.... blocked out. Now, don't get me wrong.... that is a GOOD thing.  My problem is this..... why do we edit a middle finger, or people saying BAD four letter words when a naked woman can be seen on regular cable during the afternoon, or nearly nude women are allowed on the beaches where we can't take our kids anymore or VERY detailed love making scenes are allowed before 9pm when our kids are still awake trying to find something GOOD to watch on tv? Now, call me an old prude but I definitely think that a nude woman, or actual lovemaking is something that our kids SHOULDN'T see and that if editing is going to be done.... they should DEFINITELY do it there!!! Kids hear BAD four letters words and worse at school and they also see the 'bird' on a regular basis, but my money is on the fact that they don't see nudity nor lovemaking on a regular basis. (At least, I hope they aren't at school!!!!!) When did our society's moral compass get turned upside down and that we care more about shielding our kids from bad words and gestures but could care less about what they see from the adult world???  Seems to me that someone definitely fell asleep at the helm and that our moral boat is adrift in the Sargasso Sea!!!

      Well, been a week since I wrote, and to tell you that it's been interesting would be an understatement! LOL Been taking some online tests with my Sis and we've had a blast! :-) I belong to a GREAT group of women called 'The Sisters of the Goldenmoon" and I enjoy it immensely. We have a program called "Secret Sisters" where we get to sign up to spoil a sister and to get spoiled! This is where you can shine or fizzle out like fireworks in a torrential downpour. Well, I've spoiled my sister rotten! And I am even making her a background set that is an original from me! (I'm not too bad at being an artist/designer either!) But my sister who is supposed to spoil me....ISN'T!!! I've received some goodies on the first day (the 17th)....beautiful, in fact! Then, 3 days later (the 20th), another little goodie, which is cute. The next day (the 21st), all I got was a card.....pretty flowers, but nothing else. Two days later (the 23rd), another card....of stick figures, nothing else.  And today (ANOTHER 2 days later!), yet ANOTHER card, of Garfield with Groucho Marx glasses & nose saying, guess who! *BIG SIGH* Maybe I'll get SOMETHING later on today. But if all the other days are any indication of things.... this will be all until 2 days from now. I'm VERY dissappointed! I'm seriously thinking of not participating any more in this program. Of the 3 or 4 times I've joined, I only got spoiled well when my Secret Sis was Heronwing!! And ALL times, I've really spoiled mine.....it's NOT fair!! Yes, I've really enjoyed spoiling my sis, and I'm really glad that she's happy. BUT, it's supposed to be BOTH ways.... and the sister who is supposed to spoil me (a different one from whom I'M spoiling!) isn't doing a very good job! And it happens the majority of the time to me.....I'm NOT impressed! In fact, I'm thinking of asking the Sisters who are running this round of secret sisters to NOT reveal the identity of the sister who is supposed to spoil me.... because I don't want to have to know who doesn't care enough to spoil me! :-(( MAYBE she'll get better..... I can only hope so! But she only has five more days left. :-( And one of those days is my birthday!

      I had a conversation yesterday with a good friend and waited until now to write as I needed a night's sleep and the new morning light to help give me distance in my feelings stirred by the conversation. I DO think that good friends can discuss any thing as long as respect is given by both parties. Which, I do give. But apparently it is very hard for some. We discussed the matter of possibly adding to our constitution a definition of what "marriage" should be. I am of the mind that it isn't the government's responsibility nor right to address this in the constitution. This is a personal matter between 2 people and should be THEIR decision.... and no one else's. The christian moral standard should NOT be forced upon others and has no right to dictate what they "religiously" believe onto others. Now, my friend believes otherwise.... which is fine and his right to do so.... but there was no need to personally attact me.  Telling me that if it is added to the constitution that "there's always Canada"...... or saying "that's the stupidest thing I've heard"..... or, because I feel that the government shouldn't pass laws saying what I can do in the privacy of my own home, saying, "it's alright because it's 'Debby's law' " or " 'what Debby believes' "......in a sarcastic angry/upset voice was very upsetting and very unrespectful to say the least. Also, being talked over while trying to say my opinion after he got to say his was very rude. I'm totally surprised and upset that he would do this.... as I thought he could discuss things off from a "personal" level and exchange thoughts & opinions in an adult and caring way. I didn't get personal with him..... I thought he could do the same. Apparently, I was wrong. Apparently, I won't be able to discuss my opinion and thoughts with him anymore on issues of morality, sexuality and religion because he isn't as tolerant as I was lead to believe. This is a huge shame.... as I do respect his opinions & thoughts no matter how different they are from mine.....but he apparently can't respect mine. :-(  This has me terribly upset.... I had to say "Goodbye......" and hang up before he degraded the conversation any more and said something else that might not be able to be repaired. Saying what I said was stupid and personally attacking me was bad enough.... if I hadn't hung up, who knows what else might have been said that couldn't be taken back. My blood sugar is 280 this morning, I have chest pains and I'm very tired this morning, so I know that this has affected me a lot. It won't happen again as I will only keep our conversations from now on, on the light and 'fluffy' side. VERY SAD!!

      Thought I might discuss my views on religion and how it affects life & politics and how it makes some people just plain nuts!! :-)  My first thought, is this 10 commandments monument in the Alabama Surpreme court building. First, may I ask.....where is the separation of religion & state, here? (Note: the constitution does NOT say that there must be a separation of it, just that the state can't dictate what religion we choose!) When it comes to the state addressing religion, everyone gets heated up REAL quick and screams real loud that the state has no business sticking their noses into religious matters. BUT..... when the state takes that literally and tries to be neutral by removing religious matter from it's halls, those same people stand up and scream that the state has no right to remove anything religious from the building! After all..... this country's justice system is structured with the principles of the 10 Commandments in mind.  (This isn't true, either.) Hmmmmm..... seems to me that the religious community wants their cake and eat too. You can't have it BOTH way folks! Either the state & religion are partners, or they're not. You can't say...... the state has no right to judge or dictate religious matters, one minute and then say the state must judge keeping a religious monument in it's halls, the next. As far as Chief Justice Roy Moore is concerned.... I say he has NO right to take the law into his own hands and disobey a court's ruling just because of his own religious views. Had that been any of the many people who have become before him in HIS court room and disobeyed HIS rulings, he'd bring down the full force of the law upon them and disciplined them accordingly. Well, Mr. Chief Justice Moore.... this ISN'T the way to lead. This disobedience of a legal & binding court ruling is even worse because of WHO you are.  You are an important leader and role model in not only your state, but in this country, and you are setting the worse kind of example for our youngsters to see and follow. If you are upset with the ruling, then appeal it.... go the correct way and do it legally. By taking the law into your own hands Sir, you are advocating "vigilanty and frontier justice" and anarchy instead of "justice and equality" for all. You, as a sitting judge Sir, must be blind when it comes to individual beliefs and must be held to the highest standard of morality & ethics and make justice for ALL your priority! Not to mention that you must obey our laws just as we have to! You have set a very poor example of all the above and should be removed from your judge duties, and maybe even be disbarred.... depending on whether you are sincerely repentive of your wrong doings or not. SHAME ON YOU MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE.......SHAME ON YOU! To finish the discussion on the monument..... move it to the OUTSIDE lawn..... in front of the court house so all can see it when arriving there, to remind everyone, that even though here, it's man's law that we answer to, in our next phase of life, we'll answer to a higher law..... so keep that in mind when you stand before man.

      I know it's been awhile since I've written, but a lot has been going on and I've been very depressed of late. I've had to get guardianship of my granddaughter because my daughter is having some serious problems. On top of that, my marriage has ended. Even though it's been over for a long time, the actual ending of it (filing for divorce), especially at this time with the baby and my health problems, makes it a wee bit overwhelming to say the least. My diabetes isn't in control and looks like it's affecting my liver in some way. I'm so very glad to have Barry..... he's been a life line in my stormy sea and has helped me keep an even keel on things. Thank you Sweet for being here for me..... from the very bottom of my heart. *BIGHUGS*  I'll write more later on today, so stay tuned! :-)

      Keeping in religious/politics discussion mode, I'd like to give my thoughts on the recent Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's ruling that barring same-sex couples from the benefits of civil marriage was "unconstitutional."   First, my views on marriage and sex between consenting adults has been discussed in my first Monday, July 07, 2003 entry and my Friday, August 01, 2003 entry.  Now, I'd like to expand that to include that religion or the church, has no right to dictate it either. Whatever your religious views are on how our Creator does or doesn't look at life and marriage, you have no right to push those views/beliefs onto someone else. You CAN disagree and NOT do it yourself, but you have no right to make it a way of life for someone else. You see, I do believe that no one knows our Creator's mind and that we can only decide on matters for ourselves....each person, for themselves. And that even though we may not agree with what someone else's decisions are, we must respect their right to choose it. Your beliefs are yours.....and  they are correct,  for YOU!!! They might not be for someone else. And that's the beuty of it all.... variety of life! I'd hate it if everyone was the same. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's ruling is correct..... and should be an example for every state to follow. VIVA la DIFFERENCE!!!!

      Well, it's been some time since I last posted. But then again, so much has happened within this time, I have had many lows (with few highs) to give me an incentive to write. My divorce became final on March 24, 2004. A day I will never forget. It's the day I became myself once more. I reclaimed my birthright..... my surname of Reagan. Now I hear some of you saying, So what?! Well, I was adopted at the tender age of 5, and my birth name became a thing that never existed, according to US law and the State of New Hampshire. I had to go to court to get my records unsealed. At the age of 45!! And then, some numb person had decided to take my ACTUAL ORIGINAL birth certificate and either lost it, or destroyed it! (I wasn't impressed, and neither was the judge!) So, he went and did something never done before.... he AMENDED my original (because now my adopted birth certificate is considered my original!) birth certificate to say at the top.... Adopted.... Was formerly Debra J. Reagan. WOW!!! As most of you know, no one can fool around with an original LEGAL US government document in any way. But, this was a first.... and the judge was so upset at the mishandling of my documents, that he decided, even though an adoption birth certificate is considered to take place of the original one, the original one is still the original one. And since my was gone, he had the right to amend the adoption one. As the saying goes, there's always a first time for everything! Now, I tell you all this because it's important for you to understand my state of mind here. And the fact that my Daddy, whom I love so dearly (even today) died in 1984. The day after his funeral, his wife and biological son, disowned me. (Not a surprise because she hated and abused me through out my life) Now, I'm alone in this world.... no family that is emotionally mine and no name that is truly mine. So, here comes my divorce, yet another failure in my life, and I decided to take control of my own ship, finally... at the age of 47! I told the judge that I wanted my birth right back, and got it! Now, I'm on a journey... to find ME!!! The me before my first set of parents abandoned me, before the State took me and changed my life forever, before my name changed and forever wiped away my ancestral lineage and family roots. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my Daddy, and am so very happy that I grew up with such a fine, loving man as he was, and still is in my heart. But I also know, that there is something in the saying.... blood is thicker than water. And I believe that one's soul is intimately connected to it. Because my soul is singing quite loudly at my finding out who I am, where I came from, and is so greatly affecting the person I am becoming to be. My Irish roots are strong, as well as my Black Indian roots. The search is very exciting and interesting and I'm loving each minute of it. This OLD caterpillar is now exiting her cocoon and the butterfly whom is emerging, is quite beautiful indeed! My blood pulses with the celtic music of Ireland, and American Indian and African drums..... my ancestors are looking down upon me, smiling and proud that I am finding who I actually am.... and they sing through my soul.... welcoming me home.  I'll write more soon.  ******************* "If all else fails, I will retreat up the valley of Virginia, plant my flag on the Blue Ridge, rally around the Scotch-Irish of that region, and make my last stand for liberty amongst a people who will never submit to British tyranny whilst there is a man left to draw a trigger.

      Barry, my dearest friend in Florida, coined that title for me as I am embarking down the road of motherhood once again, with a grandchild. Quite apt of a title I figure. Here I am, 47, with all of my children raised and grown adults and along comes my youngest grandchild (of 4), needing a reliable and stable home (due to her mother needing to take care of some emotional problems).  So, here she is, almost 4, and needing love and guidance. She has lived here all her life, with me doing the lion's (pun intended!) share of raising her, but at least Mom was here to help. Well, Mom isn't here anymore, she's off on her own, and I'm left to pick up the pieces. A judge gave me guardianship, so now, technically, I'm her Mom as well as Nama. A mother again, for a second time. I have mixed feelings about this, but above all else, I love this little girl (I call her, Kitten) as if I was her mom, so there was no hesitation as to whether I would take care of her. It's just that sometimes I wonder, can I do this at this time and age of my life!  I've forgotten how active little 4 year olds are. How demanding they are. How needy they are. And how loving they are. But I look into those gorgeous big blue eyes, see that beautiful cherub face, that most delightful smile and hear..."I love you Nama, SO much", then feel those little arms around my neck and everything becomes so right and into focus. And all of my "oldness" doesn't matter any more.  Yes, I'm a Second Hand Lion, and a very proud one at that! :-) And I am learning with my Kitten, that it is truly better, the second time around. ************************** What children take from us, they give.

      Good morning folks! Sorry about no entry yesterday, but I developed gout over the weekend and it was really bad yesterday to sit at my desk, so no Blog Entry. :-( Now that I'm on the subject of health, let me tell you, I'm a diabetic. It's been a rough and rocky road, and I've gone through many exciting highs of having control and being normal to terrible crying binges of out of control and twice, being over 400 in my sugar level. *SIGH* I'm losing weight, watch what I eat and getting out more to walk, and in doing so, my doctor said I could use only my Glipizide. This is good because...? Well, I was on Metformin too, but it caused diarrhea. I also have something that flares up and causes my liver to do funny things, which concerns my doctor so she watches me closely, and the next medication that would work for me, can cause liver problems. She won't test fate with the questions of what happens with my liver by giving me that med, so the next step is.... *BIG SIGH*.... insulin. So, it's in my best interests to make sure that I keep eating right and excersizing, because insulin ISN'T an option for me right now! I wrote a page about my diabetes and started a webring to help spread the news about this disease and what happens to those who have it, and to those who love them. Won't you take a look and while there, grab a rainbow ribbon to put on your webpages to show everyone that you want to help find a cure? (Or, join my webring... or both!) Just click on the rainbow button just above the Blogger button to the right here.  And thank you very much, for caring! ****************** Look to your health; and if you have it, praise God and value it next to conscience; for health is the second blessing that we mortals are capable of, a blessing money can't buy. -Izaak Walton (1593 - 1683)  Is maith le Dia cunamh.

      Good morning to y'all!  It's a gray, overcast and rainy morning here. Been this way for 3 days now! I'm ready for some SERIOUS sunshine and 75 degree weather! Well, I have to finally say something about this awful situation in Iraq. First and foremost, I must say..... even though wartime is h$!!, one can still be a caring human being with compassion for another's dignity.  With that said..... who was the IDIOT who let this happen? Well, the utmost blame stops at the general's desk. General Sanchez should have been down there, inspecting to make sure that orders were being followed. He should have visited the jail, talked with the personnel, especially since a directive was issued about proper prisoner handling, because just a couple of months before (May 2003) there had been some problems with prisoners being mistreated as the Red Cross's report detailed. With this knowledge, the general dropped the ball. He was derelict in his duties because he sat on his buttocks and did nothing!  The chain of command further down wasn't any better! The captain in charge of the prison didn't do inspections either! So I'd like to ask..... WHO THE H$!! WAS WATCHING THE TROOPS??? The obvious answer is.... NO ONE! And that is totally unacceptable!!  The troops involved.... every single one of them, in watching and taking care of the prisoners should be dishonorably discharged AFTER spending a few years in the brig. The officers, going right up to the generals, should be seriously reprimanded for dereliction of duty during wartime, lose a grade, taken from ANY wartime command, sent to the equivalent of Russia's Siberia for duty, and barred from getting any promotions for 3-5 years. All involved are definitely a disgrace to my country's uniforms and they ought to thank their lucky stars that I'm not in charged of this as commander-in-chief!

      Well, happy morning to you, Barry! :-) I'm sitting here with my morning caffiene and writing my thoughts. Going to be a daily routine from now on! I'm presently reading an interesting book, 'The Templar Revelation' by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince. This goes along with some other books like the 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' and 'The Bloodline of the Holy Grail'. Both of which I've read. It's great to see other theories about the Christian religion, their beliefs and beginnings from articles such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Vatican manuscripts, Royal families of Europe papers, old books, old churches papers....... etc. It seems that Europeans have been brought up a wee bit differently in knowing things about the Christian religion than we have over here. Here, our look and beliefs at Christianity is colored by what the Roman Catholic Church wants us to know. In Europe, there are just too many other pre-Christian knowledge and religious beliefs for the RCC to have the same effect as here. This reason alone is a pretty good reason to study the Christian religion on one's own and not blindly accept the churches teachings. Because you will never get the full picture of what transpired by listening to just the church. One should, and IMHO (in my humble opinion) MUST search God on your own terms and with your own knowledge, not just on the faith that someone else will tell you all there is to know. Because that will never happen, when a church system is set up to further IT'S own agenda. Besides, there's a saying that I most definitely believe in....'Is maith le Dia cunamh.'.... 'God helps those who help themselves'. Not many truer words have been spoken. I'm on a spiritual journey..... finding my soul's home. So far, that home is based in Wicca. Although not completely as I do also believe in some of what the Essenes believe, and also, of one great man's teachings along the Nazerenes beliefs, by the name of Yeshua ben Joseph (Jesus, son of Joseph). I know.... some of you are saying.... AH HA!!! See, CHRISTIAN beliefs! But you'd be wrong. I mean the ACTUAL teachings of Jesus, not the ones taught in churches here in the US by the book called the Holy Bible (St. James version) that you see everywhere. This does NOT properly reflect Jesus' beliefs or what he taught. The Dead Sea Scrolls among other unimpeachable sources tell us that that book has been rewritten, books thrown out and many mistakes in the retranslations over the many years, that one can not put much faith into what it depicts as Jesus' teachings. But, in exactly what Jesus DID teach, I am in awe of and CAN believe as it is mostly what my heart and soul tells me. So you see my Sweet.... we aren't so far apart, you and me! More soon! ***************************** It is a fine thing to establish one's own religion in one's heart, not to be dependent on tradition and second-hand ideals. Life will seem to you, later, not a lesser, but a greater thing. D. H. Lawrence (1885 - 1930)  Is maith le Dia cunamh.  Go dte tu an cead!

You could be a gentle Healer, a miraculous Prophet or a spirit-summoning War-mage with the strong link your soul provides to the realms beyond reality.

      It's morning now where I am going, the sun's dawning on me. I see clearly now the chosen path, my soul's light is brightening.  The night's passing went quickly by, the stars and moon's light flickered out. The darkness that had blinded me, my soul's light now brightens.  No more night's darkness where I am, beautiful light surrounds me with love. At the chosen path's end I stand, my soul's light now shining brightly.  A new day comes upon me, my eyes full of familiar scenes. I see clearly that I am truly home and my soul's light shines forever bright.

      I've been asked this by many men, two in particular. Well, here's MY answer!  Please DO open the door(s) for me. It shows me that you think of me as a lady. Please DON'T be disappointed if I get the door first though, as I'm not USED to having a gentleman around (Remember, YOU are a rare breed nowadays too!).  Please DO pull out my chair and carefully push it back in as I sit.  If I am lady enough to wear a dress to look nice, I want to continue to look nice by smoothing down the back of my dress as I sit. This does take BOTH hands to do! Please DON'T be insulted if I turn down your gesture to do so. Because sometimes, it's nice that the waiter does it too! (Besides, this gives you a break as well!)  Please DO provide an open umbrella for me while exiting a car, building, etc. Again, I took time to look nice, and I want to stay that way for you! Please DON'T be surprised if I say no to your offer. I can be spontaneously silly and want to walk in the rain and pull you along..... just because!!   Please DO provide me assistance with a surly man's mistreatment. After all, I am a lady, you are a gentleman... and you should feel free to defend my honor! Please DON'T be afraid if I do beat you to it! As I am also quite able to throw a few choice words his way too!  Please DO send me flowers, ANYTIME!!! Shows me that you think of me as someone special. Please DON'T be upset if I send YOU some!  As I think you're someone special too!  And most of all, please DO consider me your Goddess and treat me like one. As you are quite RIGHT in thinking this... because I am! And please DON'T be surprised when you are considered and treated like a God in return. Because one who is wise enough to know I am a Goddess, is truly a God himself!! *************************************** No man is wise enough by himself. -Titus Maccius Plautus (254 BC - 184 BC), Miles Gloriosus  Is maith le Dia cunamh.

      I've been reading some interesting books lately. The Bloodline of the Holy Grail (read Holy Blood, Holy Grail previously), The DaVinci Code, The Templar Revelation and now The Messianic Legacy. All have a very interesting theory. That either the Holy Grail is really the continued bloodline of the House of David through Jesus and Mary Magdalene, or that the best kept secret from most USA Christians (other than Jesus' bloodline) is that Jesus really followed and practiced a religion that hailed from Egypt and carried it on through the original Nazerene Church. My beliefs? Well, my best friend Barry even said that I'm hard to label! hehehe But, I do believe there is a Creator, that is ALL. Male and female, good and bad, and is in everything. That is why there is an equal opposite to everything in life. The Creator made everything in it's own image. That is why my core belief is in Wicca. It's the closest to this belief than any other. I also believe in some of the Essenes beliefs and the Gnostics. So, I guess I'm a Enlightened Gnostic Wiccan! How's that for a label Sweet? Here are a couple of links for you to read on this.   urlLink The Essenes   urlLink The Gnostic Belief   urlLink Wicca  I believe Jesus was a man, who lived, loved and died an extrodinary life. He lived his life according to his morals and taught others a loving and caring belief that everyone (including women) had the right to live equally and unquestionably. He had the unique advantage in that he was of the royal line of David and was to be king of Jerusalam one day and could sway a lot of people to believe in his beliefs and was a huge threat to both the elders in the Jewish faith and the growing cult of christianity. In that, he needed to be removed and they got together to do so. This way, the Jewish Elders had the threat removed and the Roman Catholic Church could gain the throne through apostilic succession and have the power and money to themselves. I don't believe that a 'messiah' is coming. WE save ourselves by finding the Creator in the way that our hearts tells us and then we live by our beliefs and do what is right by them. If it is true (the finding of the Creator) we will live by the teachings that great people have shown throughout the ages (to include Jesus) and be a kinder and gentler people. I also think that there is no right answer in just ONE religion. I think that ALL have a part of the answer and that if we all would just accept each other's beliefs, embrace each other and respect each other's ways, we'd find the right answer together. And that my dear friend, IS the right answer! ****************************** A cult is a religion with no political power. Tom Wolfe (1931 - )  Is maith le Dia cunamh.

      Today is my daughters 18th birthday.......   I'm so glad that this is my last child support payment.   Month after month, year after year, those payments!     I called my baby girl to come over to my house, and   when she got there, I said to her, "Baby girl, I want   you to take this last check over to your Mama's house;   you tell her that this is the last check she's ever going   to get from me, then I want you to come back here and   tell me the _expression she had on her face."     So my baby girl took the check over to her. I was so   anxious to hear what the witch had to say and what   she looked like.     As my baby girl walked though the door, I said, "Well   now .. what did she have to say?"     "She told me to tell you that you ain't my Daddy.  -Comedian Author Unknown

      I cried when I saw on the news that such a great man as your husband had passed away. Ronald Reagan was a kind and caring man and the world will miss him greatly. Please accept my condolences of your great loss and know that you have the support of the country and the world with you always. Together we celebrated his life and great contributions to our country and then the world (as President extrordinaire) and together, we shall mourn his passing.  But in his memory, we will celebrate his legacy that he left behind as a template of how to live life with kindness, caring, love and laughter for each of us. He truly was a great man.

      Just got done watching, 'Something's Gotta Give'..... and you know, I've figured it out. All these years of existing in my marriage, then my divorce, was just a training ground, waiting for me to finally open up to living. Even if it does hurt. And I fell, hard. But that's been the story of my life, as if it was any easier, I'd not learn (the 2x4 on the forehead thing). But it made me the person I am today. It took me awhile to understand, but as Jack Nicholson said...."I've finally get what it's all about".  It's time to fly! Maybe.....Ireland? Anyone in particular, up to flying with me?

      Well, it seems that the feminists should be very happy. I received an email stating that the US government is thinking of bringing back the draft (due to this disater of having too little active troops and using the reserves for more than they were intended to be). And that it's going to be gender blind.  Now, this email is from a friend of mine who is very liberal in her thinking and most of her friends are what I consider to be the bleeding heart liberal leftists. The email complained not only about the draft (forcing people to sign up) but that it was going to take our girls too and should we just stand for this? Should we allow our government to force our youth, especially our girls to sign up to go to war? The answer is.... a resounding YES!!!!!! First, they aren't signing up to go to war. They are signing a paper telling the government that they are of age to serve, where they live, how much education they have and that they are a United States citizen. That's all. They're not in the Army yet folks. There is still the matter of an interview with a recruiter, then a physical and an apptitude test. Both of those have to be passed before they are even considered for the service.  Secondly, isn't guarding our freedom and peace EVERYBODY'S job? Only in America has it been such a debated issue. And such a chauvinistic one at that. Most countries use all of their resources that are available to them for defending their lands and freedoms. To them, women are just as important as the men are in achieving their goals. Throughout history, women have played a very important role and have fought just as fiercely as the men and have been feared and respected as formidable opponets by many men. It's only in America where men (and some women) have a problem with women on the battlefield.  For Example: Polybius tells us that Celtic women also followed their menfolk into battle, driving the supply wagons, and Ammianus Marcellinus tells us that they also took part in the actual combat, and that 'a whole troop would not be able to withstand one Gaul in battle if he summoned his wife to his assistance.'  I say, put away the "women need to be protected and saved from the horrors of war" attitudes and let us do our share in defending and promoting freedom and peace around the world. We are quite capable to do war's dirty work as well as any man. I say.... it's about time that women are given the same rights and considerations in being more than just a pretty thing to write to and be waiting for our man back home. We are much more than that shallow pretty picture painted by the 18th, 19th and 20th American societies.  ************************ Women are not the weak, frail little flowers that they are advertised.  There has never been anything invented yet, including war, that a man would enter into, that a woman wouldn't, too.   ~Will Rogers  Is maith le Dia cunamh.  Go dte tu an cead!

      I believe life is sacred. And only in cases where there is just no chance for reasonable change to gain humanity (like the terriosts in the middle east and the Charlie Mansons and Ted Bundy's of this world) do I advocate the death penality. I am for everyone finding their God/dess/deity and getting their soul into balance/state of forgiveness. And, MOST prisoners can be helped and become productive in either our world or their prison world (for those lifers). But, I believe we have our morals mixed up with our religious beliefs so much, that we forget the real victims of serial murders, like those of David Berkowitz. Remember him? He's the 'Son of Sam' killer. He terrorized New York City for a year, and was a sexual predator who got his kicks by killing and masturbating afterwards when he returned to the scenes of the murder. He killed 6 people and wounded seven. Well, we locked him up for life (he is one who should have gotten the death penality). End of story right? Not in this bleeding heart liberal RELIGIOUS country, it isn't. Can someone PLEASE tell me, why are our prisons like fancy, rich guarded home communities? they are supposed to be PENAL institutions. By definition that means:  1 : of, relating to, or involving punishment, penalties , or punitive institutions 2 : liable to punishment :a penal offense: 3 : used as a place of confinement and punishment :a penal colony: It's NOT a country club, a place to get christianized and find God and then should be considered a NEW person, or a place of comfort for the rest of their lives!!! If these things happen, well good for them but it doesn't erase or excuse what they are in there for in the first place.  What has me more upset about this more than usual? Well, on the Today show, they reported that David Berkowitz has found a new way to reach out and basicly remurder his victims all over again. HE HAS A WEEBSITE!!! Yup! And get this, it is sanctioned, and sponsored by.... a CHURCH!!! That's right folks.... the House upon the Rock Christian Church in San Diego, CA says:  "We host this page because we truly believe that David is sincerely sorry for the pain he has caused in the past, and that he has truly repented and become a new person in Jesus Christ. We do not worship David Berkowitz or who/what he has become. We worship the God who changed a person like him, and can also change you.  We only run this site to bring Praise and Glory and Honor to our Lord Jesus Christ for the work he is doing in David's life and in the lives of countless others. Only Jesus can change a serial killer and an avowed Satanist into a lover of people and a lover of God. We consider David to be a true brother in the Lord Jesus and hope you too will come to know the love of Jesus in your heart."  I'd like to ask the House upon the Rock Christian Church where is their love and sympathies for the victims whom David murdered and their families? How do you think these families feel to see not only their beloved murdered family members story retold BY David (I wonder how many times he masturbates to this?) online for the world to see but a CHURCH SUPPORTING it? I'd also like to ask whom ever is in charge of the prison system in this country, what in the world are these prisoners doing ... ONLINE? Since when do they get such a luxury (for FREE I may add, when I pay GOOD money for mine... AND theirs!!)? It's a PENAL institution folks! And I don't give a rat's behind as to whether they have found God or not! They aren't supposed to have a life of Riley here folks! And, they should NOT, EVER, be able to reach out to the families devastated by their murderous ways, let alone, reaching the internet and thus also, our impressionable children who surf there. It's time we get back to the basics here folks. Prisoners deserve food, drink, shelter and their BASIC human rights of humane treatment. And THAT'S ALL!! My (and YOUR) hard earned money instead, is giving them tv's, radios, computers, cable, excersize equipment (like that of exclusive gyms that we can only access by PAYING for it!) and all of the programs for education and mental health that again, if we need or want we have to PAY for!! This country has gone TOO far to the liberal bleeding heart left and we need to get back to reality and the real world. When a prisoner gets the same or better life than I do and get it for free, when there are children in our country who barely are feed, clothed and not sure that they might not have shelter next month because daddy lost his job and the money is gone, there is definitely something wrong!! And we need to fix it, fast!!!

      In Iraq, a member of the new government council was shot while exiting his house yesterday. And although this is very sad, I say it's also a good thing. Why, you ask? Because the Iraqi people need to get off their collective derrieres and let these militants know that they aren't going to be tolerated or welcomed there and that their new founded freedom isn't going to be taken away by the likes of them. And us (the USA) being there is just giving the Iraqi people excuses for not taking their freedom reins and steering their own course. We need to bring our troops home now and this is what is needed to spur them on to do something about it! They need to say...enough is enough .... and take action themselves.  And in Saudi Arabia another American was executed and one taken hostage by Al Queda yesterday. And they say they are going to treat him like our BAD soldiers treated the prisoners at Abu Ghraib. And we are surprised because.....???? First, if ANYONE thinks that Saudi Arabia hasn't been involved with all of these going ons with the terriosts in Iraq and Afghanistan and helping Saddam Hussien hide weapons and helping Osama Bin Laden, please raise your hands so you can be enlightened. The prince of Saudi Arabia speaks with a forked tongue. And his so called government councilmen are no better. They only don't do these things out right in front of our noses because they know that the USA can and will hurt them in their wallets, but then they also insult our intelligences by saying that they aren't doing it! And Bush is stupid enough to say... Ok, I believe you. (So what's new there?!)  Second, anyone with an IQ of 70 or better knew that this mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners was going to be used as an excuse to the terriosts to mistreat any American they can get their hands on (as if they needed one in the first place!!). So, what do we do? Saudi Arabia isn't going to protect the Americans there, and neither can the Iraqi government in Iraq. Well, I say that our government tells all Americans to leave the middle east.... if they stay, then it's up to them to suffer the consequences. Then, pull out all troops from the middle east and bring them home. Then, all aid and trade to Saudi and Iraq be banned. Have them sanctioned by the UN (I know, I made a joke!) and then, while they are busy trying to think of a way to make us think they are really our friends and aren't aiding the terriosts in any way.... we bomb the shit out of the known terriost areas and be done with it! Now, Osama can run but can't hide from a nuclear bomb. You may think this harsh, but I don't. The ONLY way these terriosts will be erradicated is by wiping them out, period. And any so called American who has joined them, gave up their American citizenship the day they pledged their allegience to them. So, they deserve the same fate. What about the innocents? Hmmmmm, now tell me that you think that anyone who allows these terriosts to live, train and operate in their country are really innocent, and I'll tell you that you need to get a reality check and join the real world. It's time we put our might where our mouths are and say.... Enough is enough. Believe me, when we do, the message will be loud and clear to all.... either you join us in peace or you'll be erased because there is no more room in this world for you warmongers. Or even better yet.... just send in our secret weapon which is even mightier and more fierce, dependable and efficient than the bomb.... the NAVY SEALS! They'll get it done in no time and deliver Osama Bin Laden to the oval office door for you. Either way Bush.... as Nike says..... JUST DO IT!!!!

      Thinking of going on vacation? Too often, everybody BUT Mom gets one. Here's a real Mom's outlook on what's NOT a vacation!  Camping. Boy.... a LOT of well-meaning but not really thinking Dads pick this! Sure, no phones, tv's, electronic gadgets or people stopping by or getting in touch with YOU might be a vacation from your job....BUT..... here's Mom's take on it. Phone.... hey, keeps the teenagers talking nonsense to some one ELSE for awhile! Plus, every thousandth call or so will be for Mom, and hearing another adult's voice, even the telemarketer's, is necessary for her sanity! TV's.... if it was just the fact that the kids fight over EVERY show/channell, I'd agree with you on this, BUT..... when they find that one all can agree on.... BLISSFUL peace (which is VERY rare here at home during the day) rains down upon the house and even some delightful giggling and sibling interaction (the friendly kind) occurs!  Electronic gadgets. Well, these are Mom's lifeline to simplicity (as much as can be expect with 5 kids!) and expendiency so that she can hopefully retire to bed before the cock crows! For instance: A. The washing machine & dryer. With 5 kids... these are self explanatory. B. Microwave. An absolute because you can bet your last dollar on the fact that not ONE of the 5 will agree on what they want for lunch. So instead of running the oven for over 2 hours, the microwave at 7 minutes each, is necessary for Dad's wallet and Mom's (albeit very small in length) quiet time. C. The X-Box (or other video game machines). Now, I know that you screamed and hollered last Christmas about buying 5 of these BUT you DID get some EXTRA benefits from Mom on that one! :-) These are even better than tv.... as they entertain, use their intelligence and keeps them glued to their chairs long enough for Mom to clean up the house JUST in time for your arrival home!!! D. The computer. Now I know this is your favorite toy.... but while you're not here, it's two more things.... a research tool for the kids homework (which saves Mom from having to make several trips to the library where the librarian knows what's coming by the sound of Mom's car's muffler and they evacuate the library for the tornado storms {called your children} that are about to erupt upon them) and a lifeline for Mom for when even the telemarketers are afraid to call anymore!! (PS: We did get a Thank You card in the mail yesterday for our computer purchase and it was signed by the library manager.) E. The air conditioner. Now, this one might surprise you but believe me, it's a necessity with 5 kids! You know how cranky your boss gets when it's hot out and how he rides your behind too much? Well, take that times 5, elevate it because of teen age hormones and sibling rivalary and there you have home.... when you aren't there, of course! F. And of course, the most essential gadget of all, the dishwasher. With 5 kids, let me tell you, this invention is worshipped by me! EVERY mealtime is two sink full time and this machine saves me from a daily manicure (right, as if I had the time AND money for THIS luxury!!).... it saves my hands from being permanently pruned! And as for people just dropping by.... well, even the vaccuum salesman won't ring the doorbell anymore (something about not stopping by the neighborhood's looney barn to clean it's carpets because the company doesn't pay him enough!) .... so when you are home and someone drops by, it's a real treat for me! Another human being that can say more than....Mom, he's touching me!; Mom, she took my favorite cd again!; Mom, can you tell him to stay out of my room!; MOOOOOOMMMMMM....... (SIGH..... I'm changing my name....maybe the REAL looney barn has a bed open!).... and who isn't related to me!! HEAVEN!!!  And you want to take All of this away from Mom, making even more work because the kids are bored, fighting, disgusted at the "bathroom facilities", hard ground, mosquitos, cooking over just fire, cleaning everything by hand (there's the prunes again!) and taking Mom from any HUMAN contact (except for your small appearances saying... look at the one I caught!!! Boy hon, this vacation is GREAT!! -quick peck on the cheek before you disappear again into the woods with Mother nature {lucky lady!}-..... and think that this is a vacation for the family???

      Among the many discussions about Clinton's book, 'My Life' that has been aired 'ad nauseum', there was one that caught my attention. A republican party representative mentioned that this was good for the republicans because it reminds them of Clinton's antics and would energize the party to make sure there isn't another democratic chance of repeating them. But, I say, it's one of the all time great party strategies for the democratic party, and we republicans better be re-energized, or Kerry just may squeeze through! Think about it. Clinton, right or wrong, was a VERY popular president and a LOT of republicans supported him. Especially when Ken Starr's fiasco did a lot towards alienating a LOT of us. So, what better way to ENERGIZE the failing democratic party but to bring forth their golden boy, bring him front and center, while quietly playing Kerry's campaign ads all over tv, radio and the internet? Thus, intentionally but sublimely suggesting to all, but especially the democrats, that Kerry can be like Clinton and do well as president. Tieing them together in the psyche and put into the voters minds that a vote for Kerry, is a vote for Clinton and that the choice will bring back the glory of the Clinton era to the democratic party! Oh boy!! We certainly do NOT need a repeat of Clinton, and we sure don't want Wishy-Washy Kerry at our nation's helm! Don't be fooled or lulled into thinking that most can see Kerry for the wimp he is and that there's no way he will win. They (the democrats) are very determined to put Kerry there and us republicans and those who care about our nation MUST be ever diligent in our campaign to get out the word that Kerry isn't healthy for the USA and he shouldn't be elected to head it as our commander-in-chief! (Shuddering at the thought of that). Be ENERGIZED republicans and make sure to pass on the word about defeating Kerry, make sure YOU vote in November and make sure all of your republican friends do too, even if you have to drive them there yourself. It's your civil duty.... as well as a constitutional right.... so excersize it!  And to you die hard democrats who are hell bent on getting Kerry in, a message from the republican quarter....your campaign strategy STILL WON'T HELP elect fence straddler, goes where the wind blows, wishy washy Kerry for US President!

      Ok, here's my take on God. God is ALL. In being all, there is no need to fight on how God should be worshipped. Everyone is different and approaches God in their own way. And no one has the right to tell someone else how to do that. It's a VERY personal and private matter, and only the individual knows what their own soul's needs are..... well, them and God. God is who God has to be for each of us. And has been this every since we were created. God has many names, as there are many individuals who have been created since the first ones. Some names have been recorded by us for all history, others only God now knows. And the paths each name has taken are varied, but none more right than any other, as they all lead to God.  The semantics matter not to God. And neither do the human trappings of worship. God doesn't care if you worship in a $2 million dollar cathedral or a forest grove. God doesn't care if you wear fancy clothes or are butt naked. God doesn't care if you give money or not at your worship. God doesn't care if you sing to the skies or utter not a word. God doesn't care about your sex, sexual preference, color of skin, race whether you are rich or poor, old or young or your religious labels.  What God DOES care about.... is YOU.... and you finding God. You see, you can't make anyone else see what you see, feel what you feel, believe what you believe. You can only be responsible for YOU. God knows this. So, here's my suggestion. Live your life as YOU think God would want you to live it. See God however it makes you comfortable and seems true to your soul. And then.... let everyone else do the same. Respect that they too, see God how is right for them. Don't argue over it, for no one truly knows God's plan for us. As long as your heart and soul is right with God as you believe it to be, then nothing else matters where God is concerned. It's not your job to convert anyone else to your way of seeing God. That's God's job. Leave it to God, as God knows all..... you know only what is right for you. When you do this, God will show through everything you do in life. THAT will be your testament and example for others. And God speaks louder and better than you, so let God do the work, you just follow God. All else will be taken care of by One who knows everything. How can you argue with that?! ********************* To believe in God or in a guiding force because someone tells you to is the height of stupidity. We are given senses to receive our information within. With our own eyes we see, and with our own skin we feel. With our intelligence, it is intended that we understand. But each person must puzzle it out for himself or herself. - Sophy Burnham  Is maith le Dia cunamh.  Go dte tu an cead!

      What an accomplishment! A regular, non-NASA pilot made history Monday, June 21, 2004 when he landed at Mojave Spaceport in SpaceShipOne after reaching 328,000 feet, a record for privately-operated spacecraft. He entered space! Without government funds, interference or them hogging all the glory, and he SAFELY returned.  Mike Melvill is Vice President/General Manager and a Test Pilot at Scaled Composites, LLC in Mojave, California has 24 years of experience as an experimental test pilot.  He now is something only trained pilots over a course of many years at NASA and who have dreamed to be and waited to be chosen, have become..... an astronaut! See what a little bit of gung-ho, I can do it and WILL American attitude can do? I say..... OOOUUUURRRRRAAAAhhh!!! And way to go Mike! We are proud of you. Thank you for reminding us after all of this America bashing we've endured this past year, that we are indeed, a great country made up of terrific people who can be true examples of what free people can do, when we put our minds and CAN DO abilities to the task! We applaud you Mike..... and congrats on your new set of wings!

      Hi there! I thought I'd write on something a wee bit more personal than I have of late. So, here it is. I've learned a hard lesson through being married 29 years and then a divorce and thought I'd share one part of it with you. This pertains to BOTH men & women! Before you marry, make sure you have your own bank account in checking AND savings. Make sure that your pay check goes into your checking (it's better to make it an automatic deposit!). When you get married, set up a separate account under both your names. Together, make up a list of your household bills, decide who will pay what, and then write a check for that amount and deposit into the household account. That leaves your account free for your use only. And by writing a check, you have proof of how much you deposited and can keep track of how the bills are being paid. This is very important, as you'll be able to show to a judge IF the time comes as to who paid what and that your personal bank account has always been a separate agreement of that money being yours. Plus, you won't get a surprise as to the bills NOT getting paid, as it's right there in documented form! This'll help you from being too far in debt after the divorce. Also, for the marriage, set up a savings account and decide how much each of you will put into it. Again, make the deposit by your personal check so you'll have paper records. This can be for emergencies, vacations, house (buying or improvements), new furniture..... anything that will be for the household/family. Also, make sure each payday, that you pay YOURSELF first! That's right, make sure that each week, you give yourself one hour's pay EACH day and put that into your 401k/retirement account. So, if you receive 12.00 an hour, work 5 days a week, make sure you pay yourself $60.00 from your paycheck each week. Even if you already have an automatic payment set up for your company to deposit some each week. Believe me, you'll see quite a difference when you retire. Could run into the millions (over the course of 30 years), in fact taking into consideration that you have put some into it already with your employer matching the amount and the rate of interest... add you paying yourself and you'll have quite the little nest egg. And if your marriage works out, then you BOTH will be very comfortable indeed! And if not, well then you have made it possible to live nicely on your own.  Hope this has helped some, as I'm in the middle of treading water in the quake of Niagra Falls right now and wished I had known this before I got married! But, it's never too late to start!

       'The US Supreme Court in a 5-4 ruling said that a lower court was right to block the 1998 law because it might prevent adults from accessing legal pornographic material. The law (COPA) would jail and heavily fine online smut merchants who don't require adult-access codes, personal identification or credit cards to access their Web sites.'  Now, I don't visit porn sites, nor do I want our children to, but the way the 1998 COPA law is written, it'll also affect sites giving info on medical advise about breast, testicle cancer and on adult sexuality info because of the "adult" content. These sites could face jail time & fines just as well as the porn sites.  'the court's ruling "demonstrates that there are many less restrictive ways to protect children without sacrificing communication intended for adults. ... The court has made it safe for artists, sex educators and Web publishers to communicate with adults about sexuality without risking jail time."'  You see, I feel no one has the right to trample on my 1st constutional right... especially when there is a much simplier way to make sure your children are safe. It's called, parental supervision. That's right, spend some time with your children and surf with them. Then you'll know where they are going and what they are seeing, online. Don't expect the US government to babysit your children and take over your responsibilities as a caring, loving parent at the expense of my constitutional right to free speech and expression. Get the needed software/programs to block what you don't want your child to see and then spend some quailty time surfing with him/her. And leave my 1st constutional right alone. ********************** It is a wise father that knows his own child.

           Congratulations on making Gryffindor!   Basically, you're brave, daring, chivalrous, and pretty much.. an all around good person. Of course, some see you as a goodie-two-shoes. But hey, it's true! You're really good at winning, and normally always come out as the hero. Everybody likes you.. except, maybe, the Slytherins. You're too perfect. No, really.. You're too perfect. It's annoying to watch you win, repeatedly. Oh well. Be proud anyway.  Gryffindors to Remember: Harry Potter (the boy who lived..) Ron Weasley (red hair, vacant expression.. we love weasleys!) The whole damn Weasley family! (stop mating, already!!!)

      Women have served in the US Military since the Revolutionary War. Their bravery and courage was as great as the men with whom they served, but has been neglected in the telling of it in history classes around the country. They have been unsung heroines of our great country's independence and this women Marine was very happy when they finally got their rightful dues among the annuals of history with the creation of the women's memorial on Oct. 18, 1997, at Arlington (Va.) National Cemetery. Click on the title above to visit the website of this memorial. And during this week of celebration of our independence, please remember and give thanks to our heroines as well as our heroes who fought and died to give us the freedoms that we enjoy today!

          A beautiful soul lost.  A wild tiger belongs in it's natural habitat.... and not in someone's backyard as a pet. So sad that this one had to die for one human's selfish want of exotic cats. His want overrode the cat's right to live life as mother nature intended. And then this crazy world he escaped into killed him.&nbsp;This is not right.

      It's amazing at what a small time away from home, family, computers and worries can do for one's peace of mind and soul. I went to visit my friend Roland, who lives in Dexter. We've been buddies for 12 years now. He's a Vietnam combat vet and I met him at our local DAV chapter. It took quite a bit (he doesn't trust easily) but we finally got to the stage of friendship where we could (and did) tell each other everything. And knew that no one else would ever know. Well, I SO needed to have a break from everything here and he offered his place for a weekend get-away, and boy, did I ever! I saw him differently than I ever had.  He has restored my faith in men. Such a gentleman. And I have forgotten about the beauty of my state! Such wonderful scenery. Mountains (my favorite!), lakes and forests...... this restored my soul! The quiet restored peace of mind. Just 2 days and what a difference they made! That, and my friend Roland. Thank you Goddess for such a gift, I truly am blessed!

        Laurent Rebours / AP  Well, it seems that an American is setting the french on to their collective derrieres! Lance Armstrong is setting a new record and blowing away all other competitors in the Tour De France bicycle race. And true to their form of late, the french show their true colors and spat on him, booed him and shouted insults at him as he rode by. This American thought that the french have often been quite jealous of this country's achievements and had disdain of us, but even I didn't think them 'uncouth', until now.  Honte sur vous la France ! Ce genre de comportement est sous vous et vous devriez prouver au monde que vous etes civilise et les personnes de raffinage en embrassant qui gagne jamais la course et le proclamez en tant que grand athlete d'un de l'essai le plus dur et epuisant de world's du triomphe et de la resistance humains....&nbsp;the Tour De France ! Au lieu d'etre petit et moyen et de degrader un du meilleur humain d'accomplissements de world's peut accomplir.  Maybe we ought to return the favor, but in a more refined and elegant way. Maybe Lance's fiancee should meet him at the finish line with a bottle of California champagne and a large plate of....freedom fries!!!!

      Why is it that when white people mention a famous black person to make a point (as Martha Stewart did Mendela) then they are comparing themselves to them (instead of just making a point) and it's front page news and a complaint on every notable black person's lips?  But, when a black person makes a very dumb comparison, it's not even mentioned? In an interview with Today's Show's Katie Couric about the new remake of 'The Manchurian Candidate', Denzel Washington was not only rude and snippy, but his reply to Katie's question about Moore's 9/11 movie and his (Denzel's) opinion of it was....'"You know, I haven't seen 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' because I live in America. I grew up here. I'm an ex-slave. I'm a result of what this country can do. So it's nothing knew to me. I'm not surprised at all. It's just business as usual.&nbsp;" (Direct quote from  urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5489846/ &nbsp;)  EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!! Where in America have you been a slave, Mr. Washington? And WHEN??? Slavery was abolished in 1862 my dear fellow American. Although we do still have ignorant people who are racists, prejudiced and separatists both blacks and whites, slavery is a closed chapter in our history. And you aren't helping the cause of fostering goodwill between the 2 races by dredging up an old and wrong concept of human treatment by not just comparing yourself to slaves, but actually claiming you were one! When that is an untruth and is spoken by someone with opportunities you've had, the status, lifestyle and fame that you enjoy and are priviledged to have&nbsp;attained, it sends the wrong message to others that even today, blacks in America can not achieve the American Dream. It also says that you are just plain ungrateful for your success and slaps each white person in the face! Mr. Washington, let me direct you to one of your own... and his thoughts about your race needing to take responsibility for your own successes AND failures and stop blaming anyone else (especially the white man)&nbsp;for them. His name is Bill Cosby.... and his speech is linked to the title of this post. Click on it to read it. Take a page from Mr. Cosby's book, Mr. Washington.... and maybe you can become 1/4 of the proud, American black&nbsp;man he is, if you're lucky enough to be able to recognize it that is!!

      It seems that I haven't been a very good friend. Or I'm really bad at voicing correctly my views. Either way, a dear friend is under the impression that I sometimes take an absurd (and to him, unintelligent) view of religious and political matters just to irk him for entertainment's sake. Well, let me say here, unequivocally and without hesitation, this is NOT the case. Apparently, I write better than talk so here it is. I love discussing things with you because you are intelligent, fair minded, and have many views I find interesting. Some even like mine. But I find it very distressing that when my religious views are not like yours and I share them with you, you get upset at me and think I'm 'more intelligent than that' and think I'm thinking otherwise just for sport. I truly believe that God's laws (the 10 commandments) are NOT man's laws. Yes, I believe murder, stealing, adultery etc... is WRONG. And yes, I believe that God's laws should be man's.... but they aren't. This is totally apparent when you look at the cases that come before man's courts. God's laws are not followed as there are states that have the death penalty (Thou shall not kill). When is the last time you've seen anyone punished for adultery? And man's laws are unequally handed out. If you are famous, rich or can have the best representation you can beat the system.... just ask O.J. Simpson about that. These are just a couple of examples to back up my thinking. So now I ask you, seeing this explanation, why would anyone want the 10 commandments to be housed in a courtroom or building? I find it disrespectful and a slap in the face at your religion's faith! Plus, I feel that man's laws are unequal to God's and has no privelige to display His in their halls. To do so, IMHO, would be mocking God and showing disdain as they are ignored daily. I hope that my writing explains this better than my conversation with you did. Because it hurts that you may think I take your views as a debating joke.... I share my views with you because I feel safe in expressing them with you... even though they are different than yours at times, I know you are fair minded and accepting. At least, that is what you have been these past 5 years. Hopefully, I haven't been less intelligent in believing this too. You are a dear friend. I respect your views and faith. Please, respect mine and try to see that I'm sharing with you, not attacking you or using your faith for fodder for entertainment purposes.
