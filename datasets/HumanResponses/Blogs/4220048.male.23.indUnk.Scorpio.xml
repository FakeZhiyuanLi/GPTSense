        wow, I like this, I have another diary that I like, but gee I do like this.    My name is Joe, and I'm a man of useless hobbies... and then some usefull ones I'm sure, for the business mind I suppose. But my mind is not full of business. I'm not sure what its full of really, which probably gives one a large hint as to what is actually there :o)    I think I'll make a list :o)  my hobbies since I brought them up         piano... my major     french... my minor though its usefullness is limited to people visiting me from france, I don't have near enough courage to walk into a country of a foreign language.     juggling... In high school I spent my lunches and free time at home avoiding thoughts of school and this was the result. I've actually gotten a lot more recognition for this skill than any other.     sign language, I'm probably more fluent here than in my minor, but they don't give sign language minors where I'm from *sigh* besides, there's more people visiting from france than there are deaf people in my neck of the woods.     fooshball :o) I am listing hobbies after all, there's not many people that I know who can take me down... 'cept my brother of course, as a team I don't know anyone who can beat us.     TaeKwonDo. I only list it last because I am no black belt. but it is definately an obsession of mine. But then, there are so many varieties of TKD that I'm compelled to write a description of what we do :o) maybe later.  Chess.  I'm not so much the best, but nor am I the worst, and its such a mentally stimulating game :o)         Those I excell at, others, not so much :o) either that or I have simply left off practicing them for years. I can still do them, just not very well..       origami     graphology:  handwritting analysis     magic.. goes with being a juggler I suppose.     I like it :o) doesn't look like much does it. Not when you look at it like this all laid out :o) 10 hobbies, and no profits. I suppose you could include Ryans Familly Steakhouse to make 11 since I've been there for five years... might as well be a hobby. for all that I've made thousands of dollars at it rather than any of the others :o)    But then again, a hobby is something one enjoys doing. regardless of skill. Therefore, I should add :o) just because I like the whole list thing.       movies--except for horror flicks      reading--mostly fantasy and presently Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, book 5.. give me another month :o)  Computers.  Enough to get by anyways, html I never got around to.       oh well, so thats how I've spent my life so far.  just graduated, the world is open :o)
