      On my way to the shower after I got some sleep I fell down the stairs... My arm got cut up really bad and my head hurts cause I hit if very hard...  Well right after I fell my sister started screaming *Way to wake people up Lynette* and just kept yelling at me I was like * ok don't help me up i might just die here from a concussion*...   Well I took my shower and i got online and my little sister comes downstairs and turns the Tv on and wakes up my little brother and he yells at her for waking him up... So my little brother tries to get online in the other room but can't because i am on so he comes and yells at me ... well i am hungry anyway so i am gonna go and eat and let my brother on i will update possibly more then onces a day now that i am starting to drive...Bye bye

      I want to scream at Kara for sending me that song... I love the song but they make me cry cause I feel just like the song says... I hate having feelings for someone you don't want to hide but you just do cause you can never find the words to say... Well you people don't want to know this shat so I will let you go...

      I don't know who is reading this but ok. It sucks being single cause I am scared I will never be loved. If I am not loved and I do not love someone by the time I am 25, I will become catholic and a nun. I stayed at Peepi's house last night. It was pretty cool cause we ate watermelon and it was good. Well there is nothing else to talk about maybe I will tell you about my dentist appt. I have tomorrow. Oh yeah I did go to the pool today and this one dude flowed my friend and I around. Well bye.
