      It's February 29th...that's something we only get to say once every 4 years.  That's right, it's Leap Day and I feel bad for all the babies around the world who will be born today.  They can either choose to celebrate their birthdays on Feb 28 or March 1, or they can only have birthdays every four years.  If they choose the latter, then they would be alive for 84 years before technically reaching their 21st Birthday.  Not a bad way to stay young I guess.  Update from Haiti.  Aristide has fled the country and will soon be replaced by another regime just waiting to be overthrown.  Today I'm going to New Jersey to visit some family members and (gasp) might not be home in time to catch the beginning of the Academy Awards.  Oh well, that's what VCRs are for.  After all, can't miss Billy Crystal's opening monologue.

      Rumors are FLYING that the United States has already captured Osama Bin Laden.  Those rumors have come out of Iran, always a highly reputable source.  The U.S. and Pakistan have strongly denied those reports since Iran is one of those bad countries who lies all the time.  But we did admit to having intensified the search for Bin Laden which leads one to wonder if Bush has an October Surprise in mind.  Bill Maher thinks that the Republicans are going to drag him onto the stage of Madison Square Garden during their convention.  I say that if you're going to bring Bin Laden to MSG, do it at WrestleMania in two weeks so he can get his ass whupped by the WWE superstars!   Big mess going on in Haiti.  Very messy.  What a mess.  We should help them out right?  Nah, they don't have anything we need.  Forget it.  The big winner at the Razzie Awards was...  "Gigli"!  Worst Picture!  Worst Director!  Worst Screenplay!  Worst Actor for Ben!  Worst Actress for J-Lo!  Tomorrow's Oscar contenders can only hope to do so well.

      Goodbye, Richard Hatch.  The original Survivor winner was unanimously voted out last night and was his cocky self until the end.  As predicted, they first merged into two tribes of seven.  After Ethan successfully caught a fish, his new team may have gotten the impression that he’s a good provider, making Richard expendable.  (That and Rich’s constant nudity may have gotten on their nerves)  One person who sure didn’t appreciate Rich’s nudity was Susan Hawk.  He not so inadvertently rubbed up against her during the immunity challenge, causing CBS to flash a disclaimer warning.  (They sure are jittery after the Janet incident)  Previews for next week show Susan ranting to Jeff Probst about it so maybe the network is worried about potential for a sexual harassment claim.  Richard just can’t avoid controversy!     The Academy Awards are Sunday and below are my predictions as to who will win.  Picture : “The Lord of the Rings” Director : Peter Jackson   “The Lord of the Rings” Actor : Bill Murray   “Lost in Translation” Actress : Charlize Theron   “Monster” Supporting Actor : Tim Robbins   “Mystic River” Supporting Actress : Renee Zellweger   “Cold Mountain” Adapted Screenplay : “Mystic River” Original Screenplay : “Lost in Translation” Foreign Film : “The Barbarian Invasions” Animated Film : “Finding Nemo” Original Song : “The Lord of the Rings” Original Score : “The Lord of the Rings” Cinematography : “Master and Commander” Art Direction : “The Lord of the Rings” Film Editing : “The Lord of the Rings” Costumes : “The Lord of the Rings” Sound : “The Lord of the Rings” Sound Effects : “Pirates of the Caribbean” Visual Effects : “The Lord of the Rings” Makeup : “Pirates of the Caribbean” Documentary : “Fog of War”

      I just don't have anything I feel like saying today.  But on second thought, it's Thursday which means that when nothing else comes to mind, I can always give a "Survivor" prediction.  With 14 castaways left, they're teasing a surprise.  Methinks that they are going to merge them into two tribes of seven.  Not knowing what the new tribe makeup will look like, I cannot predict who will be voted out!  But it should make for a good episode.

      It’s Ash Wednesday.  Party down.  Lots of controversy about “The Passion of the Christ”, which opens today.  I dunno, when it comes to movies about the crucifixion, I think I’ll stick with Monty Python’s “Life of Brian”.  Remember to “Always look on the bright side of death...Just before you take your terminal breath.”  Disturbing news yesterday that Bush is backing a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriages.  The good news though is that its not going to happen.  Republican Congressional leaders have pretty much conceded that they don’t have the votes.  So why did he do it?  Most likely to rally his electoral base.  That and a recent speech where he blasted John Kerry and John Edwards shows that he is getting worried!  Three more primaries and caucuses were held last night, all of which were easily won by Kerry.  The most amusing part was that in Hawaii, the Democratic Party leader conceded that they would probably get a low voter turnout because everyone would be staying home to watch and vote for a Hawaiian contestant appearing on “American Idol.”  Hey, at least they know which elections matter!  On “24” last night, the terrorists released their biological virus into the air vents of a major L.A. hotel.  Too bad that Kim wasn’t in the hotel.

      Today is Fat Tuesday.  Party down.  Gay marriage.  It’s the great civil rights issue of our time.  What’s happening in San Francisco is downright inspiring as gays from across the country are making a pilgrimage to obtain the same legal right that straight people have always enjoyed.  Mayor Newsome deserves credit for having the courage to go through with this.  Not surprisingly Bush is making noise about a constitutional amendment banning it.  (Way to endorse discrimination.)  I don’t know how long the marriages will be permitted to continue but I believe that one day, as Americans open their minds and their hearts, such marriages will be commonplace.  We will then look back upon these days as we currently look back upon the days when other minority groups were discriminated against.

      Women all over the country, including many of my friends, are mourning the end of “Sex and the City.”  I never watched the show during its first five seasons, but decided to see what all the hype was about this year.  I found that beyond all the shock value, it was a genuinely well acted and well written program.  Each of the four main characters demonstrated considerable growth in their characters and last night we saw just how mature they have become.  Charlotte’s determination to have a child despite her inability to conceive was rewarded with the news that she would be adopting a baby from China.  She was so assured that the adoption process would work out that she was not upset to learn that a previous donor had backed out.  Miranda’s initial reluctance to settle down and embrace love diminished as she not only embraced living with Steve in Brooklyn but even volunteered to take in his ailing mother.  Samantha’s battle with cancer led her to recognize the good thing she had in front of her and, for the first time, embrace a monogamous relationship.  And Carrie realized that her Parisian fantasy with Petrovsky was not quite the fantasy she had envisioned and returned to her true love – New York City.  Plus, with Mr. Big (or should I say John) moving to NYC to live with her, it leaves the storylines open-ended enough to sustain an upcoming movie.  So don’t worry, my “Sex” obsessed friends, the movie should indeed happen...one of these days.

      "After careful thought and my desire to retire our supremely selected president, I've decided to run as an independent candidate for president," Nader said during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press."   Unbelievable.  That quote demonstrates just how deluded the man has become.  On to happier thoughts.  As pitchers and catchers report to spring training, thoughts drift to nice weather and the upcoming baseball season.  Below, I offer my predictions as to what the standings will look like.  Don't hold me to it!   NL East  1. Phillies 2. Marlins 3. Braves 4. Mets 5. Expos   NL Central  1. Cubs 2. Astros  (Wild Card) 3. Cardinals 4. Brewers 5. Reds 6. Pirates   NL West  1. Dodgers 2. Giants 3. D-Backs 4. Padres 5. Rockies   AL East  1. Yankees 2. Red Sox  (Wild Card) 3. Blue Jays 4. Devil Rays 5. Orioles   AL Central  1. Royals 2. Twins 3. White Sox 4. Indians 5. Tigers   AL West  1. Mariners 2. Angels 3. A's  4. Rangers   Playoffs  Phillies d. Astros Cubs d. Dodgers Yankees d. Royals Red Sox d. Mariners  Cubs d. Phillies Red Sox d. Yankees  Cubs d. Red Sox    OK, so I'm partial to the cursed Cubs and Red Sox franchises.  But they came so close last year and have each improved themselves in the offseason.  If they fail to deliver this year, then they truly are cursed.

      Tomorrow, Ralph Nader is going on "Meet the Press" and will announce that he is running for president again.  To which I say to him, "You motherf---ing son of a b---h!"  There, I feel better now.  Actually no I don't.  Nader's narcissism astounds me.  Is he in the side pocket of the G.O.P. or something?  So many Democrats and liberals are begging him not to run, hell even the Green Party won't have him on their ticket!  Without Nader in the 2000 race, we win Florida, we win New Hampshire, we win several other states that would have put Gore in the White House.  All we can hope is that those who voted for Nader four years ago refuse to do so again and that he becomes a fringe candidate with zero appeal.  Speaking of fringe candidates how about that Lyndon LaRouche?  If you're asking "Who?", I don't blame you.  He's basically a nutjob who's been running in the Democratic Primaries.  Thankfully he was not invited to any of the debates and has received no mainstream attention in the press.  The only attention he did get is when one of his supporters began heckling Howard Dean at a rally several weeks ago.  He had to be subdued by many of the attendees, including Al Franken.  Which reminds me, I highly recommend Franken's book "Why Not Me?" - a comedic look at what would happen if Franken ran for president and won.    Did you hear the latest from Bush's budget office?  They want to consider fast food jobs at places like McDonalds, manufacturing jobs in order to inflate the U.S.'s job gains statistics.  That's called cooking the books - supersized!  Cathy, the comic strip character, got engaged this week to her long-time boyfriend Irving.  Immediately after that, Marcie and Peppermint Patty visited the San Francisco marriage licence office.  Ba-dum-dum.

      This site is now the 4th selection on a Google search for "Phil Abramson".  Moving on up.  Take that, "Close Encounters" Phil Abramson!  That reminds me of an article I read yesterday about online search engines.  It said that Google and Yahoo are going their own ways.  So when we search for something from now on, we'll get a different array of options.  Before, Yahoo had just used the Google search results.  Unfortunately, the new Yahoo does not list this page.  The nerve!  Thus, my conclusion is that with their increased search range, Google is the way to go.    Last night on Survivor, I was right in predicting that Chapera would lose the immunity challenge but I was wrong in who would get voted out.  The unlucky one was Rob Cesternino.  Can't say that I'll miss him.  For someone who was supposed to be such a great strategist, he miscalculated in trusting Boston Rob.  Plus, he should have insisted on participating in the puzzle challenge rather than leaving it up to Boston Rob, Big Tom, Alicia and Sue - neither of whom are any great brains.  With 14 contestants left, they're promising a twist.  I think they'll realign the tribes and make two teams with seven members each.    Have a good weekend!

      WrestleMania XX has crept up upon us.  It is only 24 days away and I will be there with the ol’ nVo crew.  Briar, if you’re reading this, yes you’re travel plans for that weekend are fine with me.  In the spirit of merging wrestling with politics, I am providing a link to an article I wrote in 2000, likening the Florida recount mess with a pro wrestling tournament.   urlLink Check it out!   Time for Survivor predictions.  I think Susan is toast.  Last week, Big Tom called her “a hag from hell.”  She then went on to distance herself from the rest of the Chapera tribe.  If they lose the challenge, she won’t have any allies to protect her.  If Saboga loses, Ethan’s status as a past winner might do him in.  The Mogo Mogo tribe is harder to call.  They lost a member last week without voting so it’s unclear who is alligned with who.  But then again, I don’t think they’ll lose the challenge.  Stay tuned to this blog in the upcoming days when I make my predictions on the 2004 baseball season!

      In light of his disappointing third-place finish in Wisconsin last night, Howard Dean has returned home to Vermont.  At 1:00 this afternoon he is going to announce the suspension of his campaign but, fear not Deaniacs, he will remain on the ballot!  Well duh.  Even Carol Mosley Braun’s name has remained on the ballot.  For all intensive purposes though, this is a drop-out.  In the span of 30 days, he fell from front-runner to also-ran who couldn't win a single primary.  Quite a story for the political almanacs.  It’s not over for John Edwards though who came in a strong second last night.  Just as he was beginning his speech, Kerry took the stage, bumping Edwards off of the major news networks.  Now that’s playing hardball.  So it looks like this campaign will continue at least until March 2 and I say that this is good news for Kerry.  He needs to hone his campaigning skills and Edwards will provide him with healthy competition.  Plus, Edwards is not likely to go negative on him.  Plus, he’ll remain in the news and if he wins big on March 2, the media will make a bigger deal of it.   At this point they’ll take all the free press that they can get.  The only thing I heard about Kucinich recently is that he was trying to get a date on the Tonight Show.  I knew that was the only reason he was running for president... to get chicks.  Alexandra Polier, the girl who was falsely alleged of having an affair with Kerry, is on Friendster!  The Daily News ran a story copying her profile where she described herself as “Just another hot piece of ass with a philosophy degree...”  It appeared to be real though as the profile was created in May, 2003.  I logged on this morning and found out that I am connected to her with only three degrees of separation!  Of course, by this morning she took down all of the details in her profile and all that remains are the basic “name, age, occupation” stats.  Last night on “24”, Nina Myers got whacked!  Gangland style.  Although I wish it were Kim who got whacked instead, Nina’s execution was highly satisfying.   Jack : “You don’t have any more information, do you Nina?” Nina : (whimpering) “Yes, I do” Jack : “No you don’t.” BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!

      Fame is growing!  A Google search of the term "Phil's Spin Zone" reveals that this site is the first choice.  And a Google search for the name "Phil Abramson" reveals that this site is the 7th selection.  We'd be higher if it weren't for the other Phil Abramson, the guy who did the art direction for "Jaws" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."

      In previews for tonight’s episode of “24”, they’re hyping a confrontation between Nina and Kim with hints that Kim might be murdered.  Please don’t tease us like that!  Most “24” fans (yours truly included) have been rooting for Kim’s death for the past three seasons.  If they fail to deliver, we’ll be mighty disappointed.  Yankee fans sure are excited about A-Rod coming.  If he doesn’t hit in April though, will they call for his head as they did Giambi?  Today is the Wisconsin Primary.  Will Dean finally drop out or will his delusion continue?  My vote goes for delusion.    The Drudge Report is usually a fun place to visit while surfing the internet but they caused some anxious moments last week for the Kerry campaign.  Drudge spread rumors that Kerry had an affair with a young woman.  No proof whatsoever mind you, just rumors.  Well the young lady released a statement yesterday denying that any affair took place.  Now the story can go away and the G.O.P. can search for something else to smear Kerry with.  The comic strip of the day is “The Boondocks”... Huey’s Friend : “Well they finally found a couple of people who saw George Bush serving in the Air National Guard during those months in 1972 when he allegedly never reported for duty.” Huey : “Really?  Who?” Huey’s Friend : “Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder.” Huey : “You stupid.”

      Anyone up for a friendly game of Russian Roulette?  I watched "The Deer Hunter" this weekend.  Wow - what a powerful movie!  It was 25 years ago that it won Best Picture, drawing a vivid depiction of the horrors of Vietnam.  Apparently there was some controversy at the time because there wasn't any evidence that the Viet Cong actually used Russian Roulette as a torture device.  It would be reassuring if they didn't because that is some scary shit!  Especially the part when Christopher Walken, traumatized from his P.O.W. experiences, goes AWOL from the Army and starts voluntarily playing for fun.  Shiver...  If you want to see a happier movie, see "Miracle", a fun retelling of the triumph of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team.  The New York baseball world got pretty shook up over the weekend as the Yankees have acquired A-Rod from Texas.  Now I'm a Mets fan so all I can do is sigh as Steinbrenner opens his wallet for another superstar.  No doubt A-Rod is awesome and the Yankee lineup is going to be imposing this year.  But if the movie "Miracle" taught us anything it's that championships are won by teams, not collections of All Stars.  The '03 Marlins and '02 Angels didn't have any "stars", instead all 25 guys played well together collectively.  That's the challenge for the Yankees, ensuring that all of these guys egos don't get in the way of the team's goals.  No work tomorrow.  God bless the Presidents who made Presidents Day possible!

      It’s Friday the 13th.  Boo!  The front page of the “Daily News” proclaims, “Barbara Bush as you’ve never seen her before!”  Yes, it vividly shows W’s daughter in an NYC club... DANCING!... with a BOY!!!  Oh the scandal of it all.  OK, so her dancing involves much dry humping.  Big deal.  Paris Hilton would be proud.  There has been a big controversy at St. John’s University where several members of the basketball team are facing expulsion over engaging the services of a prostitute.  Now one of the players, Elijah Ingram, protests being targeted claiming that he was never told of any standards expected of the school’s athletes.  “You mean I can’t screw a ho?  Says who?!?!”  Last night, on “Survivor”, Jenna Morasca left the game to be with her ailing mother.  Turns out that the rumor I heard was true.  Unforunately, her mom passed eight days later.  My condolences to the Morasca family.  In better news, Richard fought a shark...and won!  The sucker latched onto Rich’s arm for a good half hour until he beat him to death against a rock.  Now that’s good TV.

      This morning I was at the chapel of Greenwood Cemetery.  It’s a truly impressive piece of architecture.  Although non-denominational, it clearly has predominant Christian overtones.  That's a contrast from Vassar College’s non-denominational chapel which seemed to be more balanced.  (I recall being surprised to see Jewish stars engraved on the windows)  Anyway, the purpose of the visit was to prepare for the Parks Commissioner’s annual review of the borough next month and Greenwood was selected for aesthetic purposes.  I look forward to soon touring the cemetary and seeing the graves of notorious NYC legends such as Boss Tweed and Bill the Butcher!  (Both characters were prominently featured in “Gangs of New York”)  Today is Thursday which means that it’s Survivor night.  Since there are three tribes, I’ll make three predictions as to who will be voted out assuming that each loses the immunity challenge.  On Chapera, Boston Rob and Alicia have butted heads at camp but it appears that Susan Hawk is the most alienated tribe member.  Last week she barely said a word which leads one to believe she is keeping to herself and has not made any alliances.  On Mogo Mogo, the odds are against Jenna Morasca.  She’s a past winner and rumors are also circulating that she might have left the show due to her mother’s illness at home.  On Sabaga, they clearly cannot afford to lose a third consecutive immunity challenge.  If they do, Jenna Lewis will target past winner Ethan.  The only question is if Jerri and Rupert will go along with her.  I don’t think they will.  I think they’ll keep Ethan’s strength and vote off Jenna.  Thus, my three picks for elimination (depending on who loses the challenge) are Susan, Jenna M. and Jenna L.

      John Kerry's Jewish Roots...  Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, thought by many to be a "Boston Brahmin" of Irish-Catholic ancestry, was the grandson of Czech immigrants who had concealed their Jewish heritage.  The story begins in the hamlet of Horni Benesov on the tenth of May 1873--the day Benedikt and Mathilde Kohn had a son they named Fritz. Like his father, Fritz became a simple brewer. Yet it was difficult for him to succeed in an area dominated by German-speaking Catholics. Many Jews hid their religious identity, posing as Gentiles. "It was easier to do business as a Christian," says Prague-based genealogist Julius Miller, who specializes in tracing Jewish lineage. "Many Jews just stopped practicing Judaism during this period and had no belief at all."  On March 17, 1902, shortly before his 30th birthday, Fritz took his wife Ida and infant son Erich to a government office in Vienna and changed their family name. Fritz Kohn would henceforth be known as Frederick Kerry.  John Kerry is his grandson.

      I’m not a big fan of cell phones.  Yes, they are extremely useful in case of emergencies and I believe everyone should have one for that purpose.  But more often than not, they are used frivolously and are a huge distraction.  I constantly see people yakking on them while walking or driving through the City, while acting oblivious to their surroundings.  It’s gotten to the point where some people value these stupid phones more than life itself.  Case in point, Lina Villegas, an 18-year old who yesterday, dropped her phone onto a subway track, jumped onto the track to retrieve it, and was then killed by an oncoming train.  It’s splashed across the front page of today’s “Daily News” as a huge tragedy and, while it is indeed tragic, I have no sympathy for such stupidity.  First of all, odds are good that the train would have glided over the phone with no damage done and she could have called a member of the Transit Authority for assistance in retrieving it.  But even if it couldn’t have been retrieved, it sickens me that one would risk their life for such a meaningless materialistic item.    Later today, Wesley Clark will announce that he is withdrawing from the Presidential race.  General Clark, I salute you!  I thought he was a fine candidate who would have fared well in a general election.  However, as a novice to politics, his candidacy stumbled in the primaries and he failed to gain any traction.  This became apparent when John Kerry surged ahead of the pack, using his Vietnam veteran credentials to his credit.  Suddenly Clark wasn’t the only candidate who could argue that he was a decorated military vet.  Hopefully, the general will remain active on the campaign trail and who knows?  If we get a Kerry Administration, he might qualify as a good candidate for Secretary of Defense.

      New York City has gone to the dogs.  The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show has taken over Madison Square Garden.  This is the 128th annual show, which means that the first dog show took place in 1876 – roughly the year in which most of the judges were born.  I don’t mean to be cruel but some of these judges look like they’ve been thawed and dusted off just for this occasion.  And why, out of all the adorable dogs to choose from, do they always pick the standard poodle?   They look so unnatural and unnerving.  Maybe the poodle has a special financial arrangement with the judges.  How else do you explain such a subjective decision?  If the poodle wins Best in Show tonight, I won’t be happy.    My issue of "Newsweek" arrived in the mail yesterday.  On the cover it says "Who Really Killed Jesus?"  For a second, my eyes didn't quite register and I thought it said "You Really Killed Jesus."  Great, there we go blaming the Jews again!  Now Dean is backing away from his statement the other day that he would drop out if he loses Wisconsin.  Perhaps he saw the poll that has him trailing Kerry by 50 points.  That’s OK.  He can stay deluded until March 2 when New York and California will seal the deal for John Kerry – The Real Deal!  My friend Ben directed me to  urlLink Lawrence Lessig’s blog .  He is a law professor at Stanford and has some good commentaries on Ralph Nader and how egotistical he would be if he were to run for President again.  Nader always attacked big businesses for not accepting the accountability of their actions.  Now, Nader refuses to accept his own accountability in contributing to Bush’s election in 2000.  It’s a shame to see what this once admirable man has become.  Tell me what you think of this blog!  Send me feedback at noyes1@aol.com.

      And we Americans thought that our electoral system was wacky!  In Russia, presidential candidate Ivan Rybkin is missing.  That's right, he's MISSING!  Now if this were the old Soviet Union, it wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect foul play since any dissenters were routinely rounded up and sent to Siberia.  But in this case, am I too naive to think that Russia has moved beyond such days?  Rybkin was not a serious threat to Putin's reelection prospects so it might just be a coincidence that he's missing.  Or maybe he's hiding on purpose in an effort to get some attention and maybe some sympathy votes.  I just hope that Karl Rove doesn't get any ideas.  Speaking of Russian leaders, I'm reminded of a funny pattern that existed throughout the 20th Century.  The pattern is that every other leader had hair and every other leader was bald.  It goes like this :  Lenin (bald), Stalin (hair), Khruschev (bald), Brezhnev (hair), Gorbachev (bald), Yeltsin (hair).  Then Putin (hair) came in and the pattern got messed up.

      Was I the only one who felt that not enough breasts were bared at the Grammys last night?  It seems that CBS set a standard of expectations last week.  The least they could do is live up to it.    I hate Mondays.

      W on "Meet the Press" this morning : "Saddam was a danger... Dangerous man... Could have made dangerous nukes...  Had to elimate this danger."  I think Jon Stewart said it best the other day, mocking how the administration keeps repeating the word "danger", by exasperating... "Could you say that a few more times?  I'm not retarded yet!"   But the best part was Bush's insistence that there was no way that an Islamic regime would come to power in Iraq. How can be so sure?  He was assured so by the Iraqi Governing Council's Adnan Pachaci.  He of the Iraqi TV series "Pajoanie Loves Pachaci."  OK, that was another joke I borrowed from Jon Stewart.    Last night John Kerry won two more caucuses in Michigan and Washington.  It's looking as if Edwards and Clark might flame out this Tuesday and Dean might call it quits the next week.  Then when I go to the polls in New York on March 2 I'll have a choice of Kerry or Al Sharpton.  Oh wait, there's always Dennis Kucinich.  Can't forget about Kucinich.  Saw two very good movies yesterday : "American Splendor" and "Capturing the Friedmans".  Thanks to Netflix for providing me with home delivery service.  If only there wasn't such a long wait for "Lost in Translation" and "Spellbound."  It's too damn cold out.  My winter hibernation continues...

      Anyone reading this needs to go out and get an XM Satellite Radio.  It's an amazing invention.  You get 100 digital quality channels - 68 of which are commerical-free music stations.  And they represent every genre imaginable.  It puts anything on AM or FM radio to shame.  XM is available by purchasing a receiver and then subscribing for the low price of $9.99 a month.  (Their competitor, Sirius, offers fewer channels for a higher price!)  Plus, my brother works for them!  Thanks for reading this plug.

      Rain Rain Rain.  It’s been raining all day with no signs of letting up.  But hey, it’s better than the ice storm we had earlier this morning.  Despite the bad weather, I spent the morning at Coney Island for our first meeting of the year to discuss the Beach Opening!  Nothing like a little bad weather to put you in the mood for some good weather.  The Krusty the Clown “Don’t Blame Me. I didn’t do it” game continues in Washington as CIA Director George Tenet denies ever saying that Iraq posed an imminent threat.  OK, but isn’t that what the White House told us?  No!  Word from the White House is that they never used the word “imminent” either.  Now I don’t know if they ever used that specific word but, if not, they sure used a hell of a lot of synonyms.  Let the fallout continue!  In sports news, Lennox Lewis, boxing’s heavyweight champion of the world, announced his retirement today.  This creates a vacancy in the heavyweight division that will surely be filled with exciting fighters like...  um... uh...  nope, none come to mind.  Tyson and Holyfield are washed up.  Roy Jones has gone back down to light heavy.  James Toney is out for the year with an injury.  Chris Byrd and John Ruiz are the most boring “champions” in recent memory.  Corrie Sanders has only one big upset win to his credit.  The only promising fighters on the horizon are the Klitschko brothers, Vitali and Wladimir.  The Ukranians just might be the second coming of Ivan Drago!  “If he dies, he dies...”  Nah, they’re not really that good.  But you can bet that HBO will market them that way.  And on “Survivor” last night, I’m sad to say that 75-year old, NAVY SEAL Rudy Boesch was voted out.  Can’t blame them for doing it since he was a huge liability during the challenges but it was still sad to see him go.  Have a great weekend!

      Yesterday the Massachusetts Supreme Court affirmed that homosexuals have a right to marry as they wrote “The history of our nation has demonstrated that separate is seldom, if ever, equal.”  Props to the Court for recognizing that the issue boils down to equal protection under the law.  Of course, W is in a tizzy over the ruling, decrying the actions of “activist judges.”  Um no, Mr. President.  Activist judges would be those who put you in office by stopping the Florida recount.      Now in my line of work we receive many inquiries from the public on how they may organize special events in public parks.  These events have ranged from concerts to picnics to ritual sacrifices.  Yesterday I got a phone call from a woman who wanted to hold a Breast Feeding event.  To which my co-worker replied, “Jeez, do they have to shove it in our faces?”  The baby’s sentiments exactly.  Gov. Jesse “The Body” Ventura is going to teach at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Goverment!  Is it too late for me to enroll?   I’m still waiting for him to move to California and challenge Gov. Schwarzenegger in the ultimate battle to settle the score left over from that classic film... “Predator”.  Joaquim de Almeida is sure getting around!  Less than 24 hours after his Ramon Salazar got bumped off on “24”, he showed up on “The West Wing” as a South American diplomat wooing C.J.  Now that’s an impressive resurrection!  My pick to get voted off of “Survivor : All Stars” tonight : Jenna Morasca, the Playboy & swimsuit model who won in the Amazon.

      Wednesday, February 4  Let it not be said that I was never one to jump on a bandwagon.  Much as my presidential allegience shifted from Joe Lieberman (from Dec. 2000 – Summer 2003) to Wesley Clark (Summer 2003 – two weeks ago) to John Kerry (two weeks ago until hopefully the next eight years!), I am joining the ever-so-popular trend of publishing a web blog.  Why?  Why not.  So thanks for coming!  And I hope to entertain you for many years, months, weeks or until whenever my attention span wears out.   In this space you can find my humorous observations on news, politics, the media, or whatever I feel like satirizing at a particular moment.  I begin today by sending my best wishes to Joe Lieberman – the first Jew to run for president – and, as of today, the first Jew to fail in his presidential bid.  Just as Jews around the world continue to wait for Messiah, we continue to wait for a Jewish president.  Wait, what if they turn out to be the same person?  Now that would be cool.  And by winning 5 out of 7 primaries last night, John Kerry looks more and more dominant in his quest for the nomination.  Now think about this.  Kerry is tall, gaunt, statuesque.  If you put a beard and a top hat on him, who would he remind you of? ...  “Four score and seven years ago” ...  Yes, it’s Lincoln!  Kerry should run as if he is the second coming of Lincoln.  He’d win in a landslide.  Well, maybe not among the NASCAR dad demographic...  In TV news, on “24”  they killed off the Salazar brothers last night but not before a footchase ensued over possession of the virus.  It seems that everytime I see a footchase on TV these days, I think of the chase music from “Benny Hill”and I expect to see horny old men chasing after bikini-clad women.  But that’s just me.  And Kim Bauer continues to act like the biggest moron on television by pulling the Director of CTU away from a huge crisis to discuss her co-worker Chloe’s childcare issues.  For those who do not know, Kim is the dumbest character to be portrayed on any series past or present and she will receive no free passes in this forum!     Anyway, whereas “24” has become a bit lame, “Survivor : All Stars” has arrived!  (That was the REAL highlight of Sunday night, not the football game or Janet’s peep show).  Australian winner Tina Wesson was eliminated on Sunday as past winners are being targeted.  Look out Richard Hatch!  But the two most popular survivors ever, Rudy and Rupert, have formed an alliance that hopefully will take them far.  In the meantime, after three days on the island, noone has any food, water or fire.  Let’s see how long they can last before Jeff Probst has to save their sorry asses.       Until tomorrow!

      If you’re in New York, be sure to tune in to radio station 1190 AM today at noon for the premiere of “The O’Franken Factor!”  This is the debut of Air America, the liberal talk-radio network.  I have my walkman with me so I am all ready to tune in!  Word has it that Al Franken’s first guest will be Michael Moore so it will certainly be entertaining.  And if you don’t live in a market that carries the station, it can also be heard on XM Satellite Radio.  Today is the five-year anniversary of my very first interview with the Parks Dept.  It was March 31, 1999 and the weather was fantastic.  I was a senior at Vassar and woke up early that morning to take a Metro North train into the city.  I first had a 10:00 A.M. interview with Primedia, the publishing company that produces several magazine lines.  In retrospect it was a good thing I didn’t wind up working for them, because shortly after graduating, Primedia wound up laying off many of their employees.  After finishing up with Primedia, I grabbed a quick lunch somewhere (can’t remember where) and then took the F-train into Park Slope for a Parks Dept. interview.  The job I interviewed for at that time though was very different from the one I accepted two months later.  The division I initially interested with did not interest me as much and I left the building that day figuring that I would not return.  Funny how things work!  Afterwards I traveled back up to Poughkeepsie where I had a senior class council meeting that night.  It was also one of the Passover seder nights but considering everything else I had on my plate, I skipped out on the holiday that year.  I did not wake up at 5 A.M. today to watch the baseball game.  Instead I got up at 6:30 and listened to it on the radio as I lied in bed.  The Yankees got even from yesterday’s loss, beating the Devil Rays 12-1.  The good news for me is that my guy, Carl Crawford, got a hit, a run and a stolen base.  That should move me up the fantasy standings.  After work tonight I’m seeing “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.”  It got great reviews and I’m looking forward to it.

      Long day.  This is the first opportunity I've had to sit at a computer and write anything.    It started at 5 A.M. when I got up to herald the 2004 baseball season.  The Yankees were playing the Devil Rays in the Tokyo Dome and it counts in the standings as the first game of the season.  Being a frustrated Mets fan, I was amused at watching the Yankees lose by a score of 8-3.  When it comes to my fantasy league, I had one player who I was rooting for to put me on the board and hopefully gain an early lead.  He was Carl Crawford.  Naturally, he went 0 for 5.    Then I went to work where the annual review with Commissioner Benepe at Green-Wood Cemetery finally took place.  All went well as our two months of preparations paid off.  My boss, Marty Maher, sure worked tremendously to put it together.  It was especially nice to hear Commissioner Spiegel thank me by name in his speech.  I could talk about the meeting and the presentations but all of that is boring shop talk and I don't think anyone reading this blog would be interested.  But I do want to give Chief of Operations Charlie Gili credit for the anti-littering public service announcement.  It was a great piece merging the "Crying Chief" PSA from the '70s with footage of Charlie and his staff, teaching a Brooklyn-style lesson to a litterer.    After the meeting, the Director of Green-Wood Cemetery took about 20 of us on a walking tour of the grounds.  It was amazing to see the care put into many of the stones that were created in the 19th century.  We passed Leonard Bernstein's gravesite and I was surprised at how simple the footstone was.  All it had was his name and the years he was born and died.  There wasn't even a headstone.  We also visited the grave of Edwin Litchfield.  Litchfield is the man who in the 1850s constructed and lived in the building where I currently work, Litchfield Villa.  We also stood on the highest altitude level in Brooklyn and from there we were able to look down upon the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline.  It's an amazing place, full of NYC history. I intend on returning to Green-Wood on May 29 to go on their "Gangs of New York" walking tour.  That will be based around the gravesites of Boss Tweed, William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis' character) and victims of the Civil War Draft Riots.

      The stomach virus is gone.  Yesterday was the first day in three days that I didn’t throw up.  Too much information for you?  I don’t care!  I’m just psyched that I’m feeling better!  Noticed another Vassar reference in pop culture last night.  During “The Sopranos”, Tony and Carmela went to A.J.’s high school to visit with his college advisor.  Inside of his office there was a very noticeable Vassar poster hanging on the wall.  Whereas Meadow may have been admitted, A.J.’s 900 SAT scores kind of meant that he was out of the running.  Speaking of Meadow, her TV movie where she plays Heidi Fleiss got TERRIBLE reviews in today’s newspapers.  Normally I’d be psyched to see Jamie-Lynn DiScala prancing around in her lingerie but David Bianculli’s zero-star review gives me pause.  Ah, the hell with it, of course I’ll tune in!

      "Lip my stockings.  Lip my stockings!!!"  This quote is from the scene in "Lost in Translation" where a...shall we say...escort visits Bill Murray's hotel room and volunteers her services.  After a hilarious back and forth, he realizes that she wants him to rip her stockings.  This scene and many many others make "Lost in Translation" a joy to watch.  I initially saw it in November and thought it was very good but I was even more impressed with my recent second viewing.  Sofia Coppola's writing and directing almost redeems herself from her "Godfather III" disaster.  Almost.  But seriously, she does a great job portraying the isolation one feels being alone in a strange land, and the relationships that can develop between similar lost souls.  Scarlett Johannson's predicament was similar to Carrie Bradshaw's in the "Sex and the City" finale.  Don't be surprised though if you feel jet-lagged at the film's conclusion.  Still in a Japanese mood, I caught some of the Yankees exhibition game today.  They played the Yomiuri Giants at the sold-out Tokyo Dome.  It's amazing how the Japanese people are even more enamored with baseball than Americans.  One day I will have to make sure to visit the country, only after my trips to London and Rome though.

      Not too long after I wrote yesterday's blog entry, I started feeling ill again.  Since I already finished the work I needed to do, I left work early and took a nice 3-hour nap at home.  Still felt nauseous throughout the night but have been feeling great since waking up this morning!  In the meantime I'm being careful about what I'm eating.  The latest Netflix films to arrive are "The Rundown", "Intolerable Cruelty" and "Open Range".  Reviews to follow!  Baseball season starts at 5 A.M. on Tuesday morning as the Yankees play the Tampa Bay Devil Rays... in Japan!  I'm all ready for the season as my fantasy team is ready to go.  Special thanks to Tim for serving as commissioner of "Fantasy's Finest" on yahoo.com.  My team is called "Thugz Inc." and it features an all star lineup of catcher Jason Kendall, first baseman Todd Helton, second baseman Marcus Giles, shortstop Jimmy Rollins, third baseman Mike Lowell, outfielders Luis Gonzalez, Jim Edmonds, Shawn Green, Carl Crawford, Carlos Lee, and utilityman Desi Relaford.  The starting pitching is my weak link but the ten guys that I have are Livan Hernandez, Brian Anderson, Steve Trachsel, Jae Weong Seo, Horacio Ramirez, Kirk Rueter, Tomo Ohka, Ramon Ortiz, Elmer Dessens and Ryan Franklin.  The bullpen consists of Robb Nen, Arthur Rhodes, Rocky Biddle, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Rafael Soriano.  C'mon guys, win me some money this year!

      Oy.  I feel sick.  The body aches continued throughout the night and into the morning.  I’ve had no appetite to eat anything and even threw up this morning.  (Hindsight says I probably should not have had a beer last night when I went out with my coworkers)  The temptation was great to stay home today but I had to write our biweekly report.  So I trudged into work and am actually feeling a little better since I’ve arrived.  Still have no appetite though.  But I already got the biweekly over with so I no longer have to worry about it if I happen to take a turn for the worse.  The annual White House correspondents dinner was held on Wednesday night.  It’s traditionally an opportunity for the president and other politicians to make fun of themselves.  Bush took part in that tradition by showing a video where he is wandering around the Oval Office, looking underneath the furniture, saying “Those weapons of mass destruction have to be here somewhere... Nope, no weapons over there.  Maybe under here.”  It’s funny because it’s true!  The families of Iraq war victims don’t seem too think it’s too funny though.

      The Parks Commissioner’s annual review of Brooklyn kept getting rescheduled and rescheduled.  Its new day is Tuesday and today we held a rehearsal session at the Salt Marsh Nature Center in Marine Park.  (The real meeting will take place in Green-Wood Cemetery)  The rehearsal went well but my back was killing me during the whole thing.  It’s a reaction to the rain.  Usually, when it’s rainy or damp, I get muscle pains in either my lower back or my legs.  A sign of getting old I suppose.  How great are these testimonies before the 9/11 commission?  OK, they’re not “great”, but they do make for interesting TV.  Albright, Cohen, Powell, Rumsfeld, Tenet have all gone and now the heat is on Condi Rice to testify.  Richard Clarke socked it to the Bush administration yesterday by apologizing to the victims families for the government’s failures.  The Bushies are furious, especially after one woman who lost her son praised Clarke for being “brave enough to talk openly about the truth.”  John Kerry needs to send Clarke a thank-you card for putting Team Bush on the defensive and distracting their efforts to negatively portray Kerry.  A 16-year old Palestinian teen was apprehended by Israeli forces before he could execute a suicide bombing.  The kid later admitted that he was paid off with $22 for his family and the promise of 72 virgins in the afterlife.  So sad.  Besides, the kid wouldn’t know what to do with 72 virgins.

      Life has grown stagnant and it has become frustrating.  Changes are on the horizon.  Time to shake shit up.  Last night I decided to lay off the deep thoughts that have plagued me for too long.  So I watched two mindless movies, both of which were a great distraction!  The first movie was “Old School”.  It reminded me of those college frat movies they used to make in the 80s.  This was even more enjoyable because I could identify with the 30-year old characters who resisted settling down, in favor of some good old-fashioned partying.  Will Ferrell’s comedic skills were a high point of the movie.  I also enjoyed Vince Vaughn’s shtick of signaling for his kid to cover his ears by telling him “earmuffs” and then feeling free to curse like a drunken sailor.  And although many of the supporting roles were tired movie stereotypes...the evil dean, the fat black kid, the horny old man...they were still amusing.  The second movie that I watched was “Party Monster”.  Wow, Macauley Culkin sure has come a long way from “Home Alone”.  His performance and the movie-at-large was similar to a train wreck...a complete mess yet I couldn’t turn away.  It seemed as if Culkin was trying too hard to be over the top.  But that could have been an intentional effect of the story since those Club Kids were the definition of “over the top.”  I particularly enjoyed the efforts of Seth Green’s character in writing a novel.  Two years to write two pages.  One week to write a sentence.  Almost reminds me of someone!   It looks like tonight’s “Survivor” is going to be a recap show.  Hence, no prediction as to who will go.

      You know what I hate?  When you call someone and they tell you that they’re currently on another call but will call you right back.  And then they don’t call you back.  Grr...  One of my office’s phone numbers was misprinted in the Yellow Book as being the Brooklyn Marriage Licence Office.  Every day we get our fair share of calls from hopeful newlyweds and, in a monotone voice, we dryly inform them of the correct number.  The temptation is too great though to answer their questions and possibly give them misleading information.  There’s also an impulse to answer, “Yes, we DO issue same-sex marriage licences.”  Wouldn’t that create a nice barrage of publicity?    WWE held a draft lottery last night, shuffling up the Raw & SmackDown rosters.  The coolest part was the Pier 6 brawl at the end between the red shirts and the blue shirts.  Haven’t seen that big of a brawl since the old WCW/nWo days.  A new blog has recently made its debut!

      Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder of Hamas, was assassinated last night by Israeli forces.  After engineering the murders of scores of innocent civilians, I say good riddance.  Many readers of this blog may decry Israel’s action claiming that it won’t help matters and that assassinations are wrong.  That may be true.  It certainly won’t help in the short term as the followers of Hamas are sure to seek revenge attacks.  But it may very well help in the long term.  Peace in the middle east will never happen as long as terrorist organizations such as Hamas exist and are bent on the destruction of the Israeli state.  Hopefully, by cutting off their head, their influence will eventually diminish.  The U.S. should be so lucky by murdering Osama Bin Laden.    I saw “Monster” this weekend.  It was a good film with an excellent performance by Charlize Theron.  Her physical transformation was astonishing and we got an excellent glimpse of her emotional torment.  Christina Ricci was solid in her supporting role.  I also saw “Duplex” on Netflix.  Bad!!!  I wanted to like it since they filmed it a few blocks away from my office in Park Slope and I often walked over to the set to watch.  But it just wasn’t funny!  Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore tried their best but the screenplay just wasn’t delivering.  “The Passion of the Christ” was defeated at the box office this weekend by “Dawn of the Dead.”  If they make a sequel of “Passion”, that could be its subtitle.

      Click  urlLink here  for a great article about recent statements from former White House terrorism advisor, Richard Clarke.  Clarke maintains that the Bush administration ignored the signficiance of Al Quada for over eight months and even after 9-11, tried to pin the blame on Iraq.

      Prospect Park looks amazing right now.  The snow is falling and has settled on all the trees.  It was quite a sight to see as I walked toward the park this morning.  Sometimes Prospect Park reminds me of the idyllic Vassar campus but that might be because there aren’t too many other open green spaces in NYC.  I have my radio alarm set in the morning for the Don Imus show on WFAN.  This morning I awoke to Colin Powell’s speech from Baghdad, where he extolled the virtues of the U.S. invasion and occupation.  (Usual talking points from the administration)  After going on for a while, Imus cut him off and began ranting about the lies and the failure to find WMD.  It was pretty funny.  Unfortunately I fell asleep again and didn’t awake until 10 minutes before I had to leave for work.    My dad is in the “Daily News” today!  Well, sort of.  He sent an e-mail to the newspaper with his opinion on Martha Stewart’s sentencing.  Somehow they got his name wrong.  Instead of “Stan Abramson from Brooklyn”, they printed “Steve Abramson from Brooklyn.”  The quote that they printed was “She is not a serial killer and she should not be treated as one.”  Way to go, Steve!

      Batten down the hatches.  More snow is coming tomorrow.  We still have Tuesday’s snow lying on the ground.  I guess winter is getting its last licks before spring starts on Saturday.  In NYC educational news, Mayor Bloomberg fired three members of the new Education Panel because they disagreed with him on his new policy of holding back any third graders who get the worst score on a standardized test.  The proposal passed after he replaced them with three new members who agreed with him.  Now, that’s playing hardball!  No doubt, Bloomberg is accustomed to such maneuvers from his experience in the private sector.  But this is the public sector where change is resisted at every turn and he’s getting lots of heat over it.   Fellow Vassar alum and fellow Jew, Ethan Zohn, got voted out of “Survivor” last night.  I’m bummed about it.   His departure was not unexpected though as he was targeted from the beginning because of his status as a past winner.  Now all of the past winners are gone.  With 10 members left, Chapera has a 6-4 lead and are in a position to vote out the remaining Mogo Mogos one by one.    The neighbors next door are renovating their house.  All I hear when I’m home is “BANG BANG BANG.”  How long will it go on?

      You might notice that I have made some changes to this blog’s visual interface.  I first decided to go with a white screen as it is easier on the eyes.  I feel a little bad taking the green screen down on St. Patrick’s Day and all but whatever.  The second change is that I decided to do away with the comments feature.  It became a compulsion of mine to constantly check the blog and see if anyone left any comments.  Now I have one less annoying compulsion to deal with.  Besides, my e-mail address is still at the top of the page so y’all can still hit me up if you got something to say.  What’s up with the freaking snow storm?  At least I got a good workout last night shoveling.  Best part of “The Sopranos”?  When Carmela put in the videotape of “Citizen Kane” to show to her film group (consisting of mob wives), and watching their uncomfortable reactions as the FBI Warning appeared on the screen.  The NCAA basketball tournament starts tomorrow.  Which means that “Survivor” airs tonight!  I’m still thinking that Alicia will get voted off from Chapera for the same reasons I talked about last week.  If Mogo Mogo goes to tribal council again, they’ll be in deep trouble as they’d go into a merge down 6-4.  If that happens, either Ethan or Jerri will be targeted.  My guess is Ethan.  I know, I know.  I watch too much TV.

      There was an old “Peanuts” cartoon where Lucy bemoans, “Another holiday season has come and gone and as usual I didn’t get what I really wanted."  Charlie Brown asks her, “What’s that?”  Lucy’s reply : “Real estate!”  That about sums up how I feel.  I’ve become addicted to this program on HGTV called “House Hunters”.  It follows people as they search for new homes or condos.  More and more as I watch the program I think, “Hey, I want one!”  But here’s the dilemma.  I love New York City and want to stay here.  On the other hand, real estate values are in the range of ridiculous.  Right now I have a basement studio apt. in Sheepshead Bay, Bklyn and it currently suits my needs.  But for how long?  Do I need to wait until I’m in a serious relationship with someone before I’m in a position to buy or at least pay one of those higher rents?  A single guy who works in the public sector just doesn’t have too many viable options.  Not that I’m complaining about where I am now but I guess it’s just human nature to always want more.

      Beware the Ides of March.  Now that that Julius Caesar reference is out of the way, it's time to record my observations on last night's WrestleMania event!  A great time was had by all.  Briar, Bartow, Jon, Emily and I first met for dinner at Jack Demsey's on 33rd & 5th.  It's a great place to eat but we're worried if they'll ever let us back in.  Briar fell off his chair after drinking too many waters, but not before Jon and Emily asked him to be best man at their wedding!  Isn't that cool?  Bartow and I will also be on hand as part of the wedding party.  Don't worry Emily.  Despite our teasing, it won't turn into a wrestling wedding.  No cakes are going to be thrown if I have any say about it!  It's all happening on Memorial Day Weekend 2005 and I'm looking forward to it.  From there we walked to MSG screaming "Whooo!!!"  all the way.  The line stretched around the block but it moved pretty quickly as there was no security checking people.  We got to our seats at around 6:45 and it appeared to be the section reserved for people who either works for WWE or knows someone who works for WWE.  We fell into the latter category.  Thanks, Tony!  The Harlem Boys Choir sang "America the Beautiful", Vince's national anthem.  We then saw a video opening montage that culminated in a shot of Vince, Shane and Shane's new baby.  I can't wait for the power struggle in 30 years between Shane's baby and Stephanie and HHH's eventual kid.  First match was John Cena winning the U.S. Title against the Big Show.  Good idea to start with Cena as he got the crowd going.  Then Booker T & RVD retained the World Tag Titles.  Nothing too special there.  Christian then defeated Chris Jericho as Trish turned heel and aligned with Christian.  Poor Jericho has now lost at three straight WMs.  Trish should be fun to watch as a heel though.  I couldn't hear JR's commentary but I imagine that he screamed "What a Jezebel!"  The next match was Evolution defeating Mick Foley and The Rock when Orton pinned Foley.  The crowd was solidly behind Ric Flair during the match.  Right above us a banner was draped across the rafters that said, "Whoooo!  Thank You Ric Flair."  Unfortunately, before the PPV started, MSG ushers took the banner down.  They had an old lady usher do it because if it were anyone else, they might have gotten beat up.  Sometime around here we saw the Hall of Fame inductees.  Great to see Bobby Heenan, Jesse Ventura and Pete Rose.  Good to see Tito Santana, Don Muraco and the kin of Big John Studd and the Junkyard Dog.  Indifferent to see Sgt. Slaughter since he's always on TV.  The fifth match had Sable and Torrie beating Stacy and Jackie in an evening gown match, which degenerated into a bra and panties match.  Standard T&A fest.  Then, the cruiserweight open took place.  Chavo Guerrero won it but the highlight was Tajiri inadvertently spraying Akio with his mist.  Akio was then unable to enter the match which led to a fan behind us to yell "You Screwed Akio."  Bartow's response, "No, Akio Screwed Akio."  During the match we chanted the names of cruiserweights we would have liked to see included such as Super Calo, Silver King and La Parka.  The next match was perhaps the most bizarre match in WM history.  Goldberg defeated Brock Lesnar.  The problem was that both guys are leaving WWE.  They say that only 10% of the fans read the internet, but every one of those 10% must have been in MSG last night.  Fans chanted "You sold out", "Nah Nah Nah Nah, Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye", "This match sucks", "Stun them both", "Austin Austin", "We Want Bret", "Hogan", and lots more.  Neither Goldberg nor Lesnar looked too pleased with the crowd reaction.  The next match was my requisite bathroom break as Rikishi and Scotty retained their Tag Titles.    Upon returning from the bathroom I saw a promo promising "Edge is coming."  Funny, I thought Val Venis was coming.  The next match had Victoria defeating Molly.  Molly then had her head shaved.  She now looks a little bit like the bald chick from the first Star Trek movie.  Then, Eddie Guerrero defended the WWE title against Kurt Angle.  It was a very sound match from two of their best.  The next match featured the return of the Dead Man.  That's right, the Undertaker came back with Paul Bearer and Druids.  This was to Bartow's chagrin who wailed "No good can come from druids!"  Indeed, the druids kept dropping their fire and a lackey had to keep running out with his fire extinguisher.  Oh yeah, Undertaker won.  The final match had Chris Benoit winning the World Title from HHH and HBK in a triple threat match.  This was by far the best match of the night.  The crowd was solidly behind Benoit and we went ballistic when HHH tapped to the crossface.  I almost lost my voice in all the excitement!  To close the show, Eddie Guerrero came down to congratulate Benoit as confetti fell from the ceiling.  Benoit's wife (Woman) and children also came down.  Five hours after the show started we made our leave.  Except for Jon and Emily who left after the Undertaker's entrance.  Special thanks to the entire nVo crew for treating me to my ticket.  Its a much appreciated birthday present.  If I can ever give you a nice B-D present five months after your actual B-D, I'll be glad to.  For another amusing take on last night's festivities,  urlLink read this link from the ESPN page.

      In New York, the Deputy School Chancellor was forced to resign over a nepotism scandal.  In order to ensure that no such scandal happens again, they picked a replacement who is not related to anyone.  WrestleMania XX is this weekend and the band is getting back together.  Looking forward to seeing the entire nVo crew as we’ll be there in MSG.  For a full history of the nVo and our adventures dating back to 1996,  urlLink read this!   My “Survivor” prediction was accurate again as Colby was voted out.  His teammates cited the same reason I did yesterday, that they needed to vote him out before a merge, otherwise he’d win all the individual immunity challenges.

      No longer will talk radio be dominated by the ultra-conservatives voices of Rush, Hannity and their ilk.  Beginning on March 31, “Air America” goes on the air!  This is the long awaited liberal talk radio station.  In New York, it will air on WLIB (1190 AM).  Highlights will include Al Franken’s noon – 3 pm timeslot.  His show will be called “The O’Franken Factor.”  I’m sure O’Reilly will not be pleased.  Also, comedian Janeane Garafolo gets the 8 pm – 11 pm timeslot with her show “The Majority Report.”  And Robert Kennedy Jr. will get a weekend show.  I’ll certainly tune in from time to time.  Now all we need is for them to get on the air in swing state markets!   John McCain made some news yesterday.  When a reporter asked him about the prospect of being Kerry’s running mate, McCain refused to rule it out.  They have gotten along very well in the Senate due to their Vietnam experiences and there is no love lost between Bush and McCain.  But the idea that McCain would even consider switching parties had to be jarring news to the G.O.P.  The good senator from Arizona is highly respected by most Americans, including those who are independents.  A Kerry-McCain ticket would be devastating.  But it won’t happen.  A Kerry-Tom Brokow ticket... that could be good too!  It’s time for my weekly “Survivor” predictions.  In Chapera, Boston Rob and Amber have made an alliance with Rupert and Jenna.  They also have an alliance with Big Tom.  Only Alicia is left out.  Rather than betray one of their alliances this early, they should opt to vote Alicia out.  Then Rob and Amber can keep their options open as they head into a merge.  In Mogo Mogo, Lex has emerged as the power player.  He seems to have alliances with everyone and everyone trusts him so far.  Colby is on thin ice though.  He’s already rubbed Jerri, Shi Ann and Kathy the wrong way.  Ethan is also weary of him since Colby presents tough competition.  Since Colby was a master at winning immunities in Australia, I think they’ll want to get rid of him before the merge happens.  Therefore, depending on who loses the challenge tonight, I predict that either Alicia or Colby will be voted out.

      The Game Show Network has renamed itself “GSN”.  This is in the tradition of The Learning Channel renaming itself “TLC” and The National Network renaming itself “TNN” (before changing that one to “Spike TV”)  Don’t you dare call them by their full former names, otherwise an irate entertainment CEO will come after you.  I love acronyms that don’t stand for anything.  Last year I dumped Cablevision and got a satellite dish instead.  It’s been great.  More programming choices, clearer reception, lower rates.  Now I’m really glad that I chose DirecTV because their competitor, the DISH Network, has dumped all of the Viacom stations during price negotiations.  That includes CBS.  How insane is that?  This standoff can only hurt DISH Network.  Much more than the standoff between Cablevision and YES.  DirecTV better not pull any stunts like this in the future!    In an effort to make their menu healthier and to defend themselves against lawsuits, McDonald’s is dropping the option to “SuperSize” your order and they are increasing marketing for their salads.  Because whereas a cheeseburger has 11.5 grams of fat, a Chicken Caesar salad has 18.4 grams of fat.  Way to go, guys!  In celeb death news, the guy who played the painter on “Murphy Brown” passed away yesterday.  Didn’t it take him something like 6 years to paint Murphy’s house?  He was ALWAYS there.  Maybe there was more than some paining going on, nudge wink.

      The latest celebrity who died is Paul Winfield.  Winfield was a celebrated actor with a long career but the role that I most distinctly remember was in “Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan.”  Winfield’s character joined Chekhov in their visit to City Alpha V.  After being captured by Khan and his cronies, they had those disgusting looking beetle larvae inserted into their ears.  The larvae were first extracted from this huge insect that Khan kept in an aquarium tank.  They were then put inside Winfield and Chekhov's space helmets so they could crawl along their faces and into their ears.  That scene made such an impression on me when I was a kid.  My friends and I would act it out, mimicking Winfield and Chekhov’s horrified expressions as the larvae attacked them.  Ah, great moments in film history.

      Lots of news this morning.  First of all, the Iraqi Governing Council signed a constitution that will supposedly go into effect when Iraq regains their sovereignty on July 1.  I’m feeling all patriotic about Iraq now.  I wonder if they have a national anthem.  If they do, I’d like to sing it.  (I’m reminded of Nikolai Volkoff, the evil Soviet wrestler who became a good guy when the USSR abandoned communism.  Suddenly his renditions of the Soviet national anthem went from “How dare he sing that!” to “Aw, isn’t that cute?” WWE can do the same thing today with a “reformed” Sgt. Slaughter, Col. Mustafa and Gen. Adnan.)  In other wrestling news, Hercules Hernandez (real name, Ray Fernandez) died over the weekend.  Another ex-wrestler added to the dead pool.   John Henry Williams also died from leukemia over the weekend at the young age of 35.   This is Ted Williams’ son.  The same guy who had his father frozen in a cryogenics laboratory.  Maybe now that he’s out of the picture, Ted Williams can be given a proper burial.  In better news, someone who we thought was dead, isn’t!  That girl who disappeared on her way from Poughkeepsie to Brooklyn resurfaced over the weekend where she was chilling in the Hamptons.  Hmm.  Well, it is spring break, right?  Newly acquired Mets, Karim Garcia and Shane Spencer are in trouble.  They got drunk at a pizzeria a few days ago and Garcia took a piss on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant.  When a delivery boy chased after them, they confronted him, causing him to fall over some bushes.  Now the delivery boy is threatening to press charges.  Let’s Go Mets.  “The Sopranos” came back last night with a bang!  A highlight was a waiter getting whacked when he demanded a bigger tip.

      Just got back from a successful shopping expedition.  Among my purchases were a new watch (have been without one since my old watch broke on New Years Eve), a new keychain (my Vassar bev-key held up for five years but no more), the "Monday Night Wars" DVD, and Caren Lissner's new book "Starting from Square Two."  Caren is a great new writing talent who I had the pleasure of meeting a few months ago.  I'm glad to give her a plug, so  urlLink buy her book!   "The Sopranos" starts its new season tonight.  Can't wait!

      Martha Stewart - guilty!  Or as she would say, it's a bad thing.  Well at least she'll have the best decorated cell on the block.    Mayor Bloomberg reportedly told a roomful of gays and lesbians that he personally supports gay marriage.  Good for him.  But then his press secretary started backtracking.  It's a shame that the mayor won't go on the record with his opinion.  Instead of genuinely helping the movement progress, he comes off as pandering.  Saw two good movies recently on DVD.  "Pieces of April" and "School of Rock".  Highly recommended.  "Pieces of April" actually got to me a little bit.

      I was wondering how long it would take after Bush started airing 9-11 images in his campaign ads before there would be a backlash.  The answer turned out to be...not long.  As soon as the ads hit the airwaves, 9-11 families charged him with politicizing the tragedy and a big protest is planned for this afternoon at Ground Zero.  All of a sudden, what was supposed to be a positive ad to kick off his campaign has caused the Bush team to go on the defensive.  The thing is, without 9-11, he doesn’t have too many other cards to play.  Bush will need to invoke it all he can in order to avoid talking about the economy or Iraq.  Speaking of the campaign, I’m very depressed this morning with the national poll results.  Bush and Kerry are in a dead heat with Nader pulling 6%.  That’s 6% that could have given Kerry a decent sized lead.  What’s wrong with these people who would still consider voting for Nader, especially knowing what happened last time?  It’s too depressing to think about.  Turns out I was right (again) with my “Survivor” prediction.  Susan Hawk is gone, having had a nervous breakdown and quitting the game.  She’s got some emotional issues to work out.

      Big announcement from NASA the other day.  The Mars Rover found a rock.  No big surprise there, if there’s one thing Mars has a lot of, it’s rocks.  But this is no ordinary rock, ladies and gentlemen.  This rock has evidence on its surface that water once existed atop it.  There is water on Mars!  Or should I say, there was water on Mars.  As Jon Stewart points out, this leads to the inevitable conclusion that Mars once had waterparks.  Next thing we know, the Mars Rover will send back photos of a Slip ‘N Slide.  As we get excited about amusement parks on Mars, there’s lots of tumult going on in the Disney empire.  Michael Eisner was stripped of his Chairman position by the stockholders and he is being replaced by George Mitchell.  Yes, George Mitchell, the former Senator and broker of the Irish Peace Accords.  Is there anything the man doesn’t do?    Funny but true story from the Daily News...  THREE SENIORS HURT IN SALAD-BAR SLUGFEST  There’s nothing like a good old fashioned food fight.  Just ask any kid in junior high school and the old folks at Spring Haven Retirement Community. A brawl over the salad bar send three seniors to the hospital during the weekend. Words were exchanged when a 62-year old man spent a little too much time picking through the greens.  He “only likes a certain kind of lettuce,” said his 80-something mom, who also lives at the home. When the other folks at the home berated the man, he punched an 86-year old in the nose and bit a 78-year old man on the right arm, the News Chief newspaper reported yesterday. The lettuce picker has now been evicted.  “This is the first time in 25 years I’ve ever heard of something like this happening,” said Jill Andrew, spokeswoman for the facility.  Susan Hawk is going to be the next one eliminated from “Survivor”.  Take that to the bank.

      Congratulations to John Kerry – the Democratic Presidential Nominee.  With wins in 9 of the 10 Super Tuesday states, Kerry is the last standing major candidate as John Edwards is expected to drop out today.  The only primary Kerry didn’t win was Vermont as, despite dropping out, Howard Dean picked up his home state.  At least the good doctor will always have Vermont.  President Bush called Kerry last night to offer his congratulations, to which Kerry responded, “Go fuck yourself.”  Or maybe he really said, “I look forward to debating the issues of our nation’s future.”  Either way it’s going to be a long and nasty campaign.  Chris Matthews remarked, “8 months?!? You can have a baby in nearly 8 months.”    Aristide is bitching from his exile that he never left Haiti voluntarily and that he was the victim of a U.S. coup.  Maybe so.  It’s hard to condone removing a nation’s elected leader but the bottom line is that we saved the guy’s life and prevented a hell of a lot of violence that would have broken out if the rebels stormed the capital.    Barry Bonds, Gary Sheffield, Jason Giambi...  steroid junkies!  This is bad for baseball, very bad.  It’s been obvious from looking at the size of these ballplayers that something’s been up but now the shit is hitting the fan.  Giambi is now a fraction of the size that he used to be and looked downright sheepish when reporters questioned him yesterday.  And Sheffield’s rep released a statement that he never “knowingly” took steroids.  Didn’t take them long to break out the legalese.    This use of illegal steroids makes Pete Rose’s gambling seem insignificant by comparison.  Yet he is the one who is barred from the MLB Hall of Fame.  Enter Vince McMahon!  Rose is being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame at WrestleMania.  From 1998-2000, Rose made cameo appearances by getting into scuffles with Kane.  So on March 14, Kane will present Rose with his plaque.  Jesse Ventura will be on hand too.  Can’t wait to see the wacky shenanigans that will ensue!

      Yesterday at work, an Orthodox Jewish employee entered the office of an Irish employee.  After a brief meeting, the Orthodox Jewish employee left and accidentally left behind a plastic bag.  A half hour later, the Irish employee first noticed the bag and said, “Ooh.  What’s this?  Did someone leave me a present?  What could it be?”  He then opened the bag and examined the object.  “Hmm.  Not quite sure what this is.  It looks like an ammunition belt.”  He then walked out of this office to show his staff his new ammunition belt.  After a long laughing fit, we informed him that he was holding tiffilin, a ritual prayer accessory used by Orthodox Jews.  The tiffilin was soon returned to its rightful owner.  It’s Super Tuesday, which means that after months of reading and watching news coverage about other states primaries, I get to vote in one myself!  After work, I’m heading to P.S. 206 – the same building where I attended Pre-Kindergarten through the 5th grade, and am going to cast my vote.  If Kerry sweeps, as is expected, Edwards will likely drop out tonight.  So today is probably the final day of the primary campaign.  Sniff sniff, what will we talk about for the next few months?

      I got 17 out of my 21 Oscar Predictions correct.  Not too bad.  The only categories that I missed were Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Sound Effects and Makeup.  Although I thought Sean Penn was fantastic in “Mystic River”, I wasn’t sure if the Academy would honor him because of his controversial reputation.  Fortunately I was wrong as Penn is a very deserving winner.  I was also surprised that “Lord of the Rings” won every single award is was nominated for, tying the record set by “Ben-Hur” and “Titanic”.  Otherwise there weren’t too many surprises on Oscar night.  This morning I have the song from “A Mighty Wind” stuck in my head and it won’t leave.  Damn you and your comic genius, Eugene Levy!  I cannot get over how warm the weather is outside.  No more heavy winter coat!  The deep freeze of winter has finally ended...although there are still patches of snow that can be found here and there.

      Bush and Cheney met with the 9-11 panel.  Alas, it was in private with no TV coverage and no written transcripts.  I would imagine that Bush sat on Cheney’s knee as the VP did his best impression of a ventriloquist.  Maybe he even made a talking Bush voice as he drank a glass of water!  We had another Parks event today.  It was a groundbreaking at Harry Maze Playground in East Flatbush.  The fun part was when our sound system went on fire a half-hour before the event started.  It wasn’t as bad as it sounds, but lots of smoke did emanate from the speakers.  So my boss ran to Radio Shack and bought a Karaoke machine which served as our sound system for about a half hour until it went dead in the middle of some guy’s speech.  (Kinda appropriate though since the guy was pontificating for way too long)  So my boss returned the Karaoke machine as soon as the event was over and is presumably shopping for something else at this moment as we have another event tomorrow for Arbor Day!  Yipee.   Last week I predicted Shii Ann’s departure on “Survivor” and she certainly would have been voted out except she won immunity.  Barring another miracle, she is certain to go tonight.  Then we will be left with Boston Rob, Amber, Rupert, Jenna and Big Tom!

      Saw “Wicked” last night.  It was great!  (Warning – Spoilers Below!)  The musical “Wicked” is quite different from the book “Wicked”.  The first act has some slight differences that work well for the stage medium in the sense that it moves the story along more fluidly.  For example, it skips over Elphaba’s upbringing and jumps right into her entry to Shiz University.  It also has her sister Nessarose beginning school at the same time as Elphaba and Glinda.  This way we meet all the main characters at once.  The show then focuses on the relationship between Elphaba and Glinda with many duets between the two.  Whereas the book had heavy political and metaphorical content, the musical is more driven by the relationships.  The many atrocities of the Wizard in the book, are boiled down in the musical to his suppression of animals.  In the second act though, the musical veers wildly off the novel and becomes a story unto itself.  But it’s a damn good story!  We see the origins of the Cowardly Lion (alluded to in the book), the Tin Man (it’s Boq!), and the Scarecrow (it’s Fiyero!).  In this regard it does a great job of connecting Gregory Maguire’s world with L. Frank Baum’s world with some surprising twists along the way.  Finally, Elphaba’s fate is dramatically satisfying.  Whereas her affliction to water is all too real in the book, she plays it up to her advantage in the musical, leading to quite an ending.  I just don’t know if I can shake the image of the Wicked Witch and the Scarecrow together.    The performers in "Wicked" were on top of their game.  Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are remarkably talented actresses with some amazing pipes!  The main reason that I wanted to see "Wicked" was to see both of them perform in the lead roles.  They both deserve Best Actress Tony Nominations.  Chenoweth might win because she is the bigger name, but Menzel was the heart of the show.  And how about Joel Gray?  72-years old and he's still doing his thing.  Glad to see his in such great shape.  Finally, the Playbill said that the actress who played Madame Morrible used to appear in "The Cosby Show" (one of my favorite late-night cable rerun options).  After wondering who she played, I remembered - Rudy's teacher!  The one who used to give Kenny a hard time.  Between her and Phyilicia Rashad appearing in "A Raisin in the Sun", it's a Cosby takeover of Broadway!  Or something like that...

      So much work, so little time.  This week we have a groundbreaking ceremony on Thursday and then two Arbor Day events on Friday.  Plus there’s the Coney Island events poster I’m designing and mooring permits that need to go out.  It can be overwhelming so I’m taking it slow and focusing on one thing at a time.  Meanwhile one of my less-experienced co-workers is on the verge of a breakdown.  Ah, rookies.  Tonight I am seeing “Wicked”!  Can’t wait.  It is a Broadway musical that is a prequel to “The Wizard of Oz.”  I read the Gregory Maguire book that it was based on in November and look forward to comparing this adaptation to the original work.  A review of the show will be forthcoming.

      Taking full advantage of my Netflix subscription means ordering every single feature film release under the sun.  One case in point was "Cheaper by the Dozen."  It made over $100 million at the box office so how could I not check it out?  I'd give you a plot synopsis except that there's not much of one.  Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt want a big family so they have 12 kids.  Yes, 12.  They also want careers which involve moving the family to a different town.  The kids (brats that they are) aren't too happy with this and spend the better part of 90 minutes acting out.  I suppose it was supposed to be funny.  It's as if the producers said, let's put Steve Martin with a bunch of kids and see the wackiness that will ensue.  Wackiness indeed.  My next Netflix film to watch is "The Matrix Revolutions."  I actually started it last night.  I watched a half-hour before my eyelids became very heavy and I turned it off to go to sleep.  I'll probably finish the movie at some point today.  Congratulations to Vitali Klitschko, boxing's NEW heavyweight champion of the world.  Last night he won the title vacated by Lennox Lewis.  In his corner was his younger brother, Wladimir, who has been having his own problems in the ring.  If this was wrestling, Wladimir would turn heel on Vitali and demand a title shot, ala the Bret Hart vs Owen Hart wars of 1994.

      We always get a nice turnout from the local press at our Parks events.  The Daily News ran a story about the Wyckoff House event that I described yesterday.   urlLink You can read the article here.   Just got back from Coney Island where we met to discuss the annual beach opening ceremony.  While there, I took a walk along the boardwalk and admired the four new performance gazebos that were installed.  These pavilions are named after the amusement parks of yesterday (Dreamland & Steeplechase) and the amusement parks of today (Astroland and Deno’s Wonder Wheel Park).  When we have the ceremony in late May, the big photo-op will be the unveiling of one of the gazebos, as a band plays inside it.  In the meantime one of the big projects that I’m working on is designing a Coney Island Events Poster that will be displayed on our 9 boardwalk kiosks.  Jon Stewart was hilarious on The Daily Show the other night.  He was making fun of our indecision over who we would be handing Iraqi sovereignty over to on June 30.  At his press conference Bush had told a reporter “We’ll get back to you on that.”  Stewart’s reply : “Wait!  Don’t tell me!  I’ll wait up bright and early on June 30th, tip toe down the stairs in my footsie pajamas, and see who will be the new leader of Iraq sitting under the tree.  Wait, what if it’s me?  Just think, I could be the leader of Iraq!  Oh my god, that would be the best June 30th ever!”  On “Survivor”, Shii Ann was marked for elimination last night and the only way she could be saved was if she had won immunity.  So, she did!  Without the option of voting out Shii Ann, the original Chapera members turned on their own and ejected Alicia who they had earlier indicated was the “least deserving of being an All-Star.”

      This morning we had an event at the Wyckoff House.  Not only is it the oldest house in New York City, it’s the oldest house in New York State.  It was built by Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, a Dutch settler, in 1652 on land that was recently taken from the local Canarsee Indian tribe.  Wyckoff’s descendants continued to farm the land until 1901.  In the 1960s it was declared a National Historic Landmark.  The house exists today as a museum that is owned by the Parks Department.  Today’s event was to herald some new improvements that are coming to the grounds.  The weather was great, the speeches were short, and the school kids in attendance were very knowledgeable about the site’s history.    Lauren Sullivan, one of my favorite co-workers of all time, told me today that she is leaving Parks.  Her husband is a musician in the band Guster and she is forming a non-profit organization that works with musicians to promote environmental issues.  I’m happy for her but very sad to see her go.  Fortunately she will still be living in Brooklyn and has promised to visit and do lunch.       My “Survivor” prediction is Shii Ann, last of the Mogo Mogos.

      I’m getting a raise!  Yay!  OK, it’s not a big raise, but it’s something.  Last night, the Mayor made a deal with the Union for 5% increases.  This comes as a slight surprise as there had been no indications that a deal was forthcoming.  The Mayor had previously taken a hard stance that there would be no raises without productivity improvements, and no retroactive raises.  He backed away on both points.  My guess is that he wants peace with the labor unions during his upcoming reelection campaign.  His poll numbers have been improving and this  might  help.  (Yes, there are negative parts of the deal.  It’s less than the 8% increase given in 2001 and it reduces starting salaries for new hires)  But all in all, something is better than nothing and up until this point I had been expecting nothing.

      Today is the anniversary of some sad events.  It’s 13 years ago today that my Grandpa Murray passed away and it’s 5 years ago today that the Columbine shootings happened.  To top that off, it’s Hitler’s birthday!  Let’s hope that this 4-20 is more uneventful.  Great weather this week.  Spring has finally arrived and the parks are bustling with people.  Phones are ringing off the hook, special events are being planned.  It should be crazy like this until... oh I’d say October.  Today’s Daily News features The Ten Worst Songs of All Time, as decided by Blender Magazine.  They are...   1)  “We Built this City”   (Starship)   2)  “Achy Breaky Heart”   (Billy Ray Cyrus)   3)  “Everybody Have Fun Tonight”   (Wang Chung)   4)  “Rollin”   (Limp Bizkit)   5)  “Ice Ice Baby”   (Vanilla Ice)   6)  “The Heart of Rock & Roll”   (Huey Lewis and the News)   7)  “Don’t Worry Be Happy”   (Bobby McFerrin)   8)  “Party All the Time”   (Eddie Murphy)   9)  “American Life”   (Madonna) 10)  “Ebony and Ivory”   (Paul McCartney & Stevie Wonder)

      Good luck tomorrow to all of those third-graders taking the exam that will single-handedly determine if they are going to become fourth-graders.  I think it's utterly insane that the promotion of a child (a CHILD!) will boil down to their performance on ONE standardized test.  Yes, standards need to be established but c'mon!  So I'll be rooting for you little kiddies.

      My new favorite word is “riff raff”.  As in describing those less than desirable elements.  Such as... “The bed and breakfast in Park Slope does not have any identifiable signs in order to keep away the riff raff.”    There was this guy on the subway this morning who looked a little bit like my old political science professor, Mr. Born.  Especially the face and glasses.  Except where Mr. Born had short, thinning hair, this guy had long straggly hair that went down to his shoulders.  So he sort of looked like Mr. Born had he gone to Woodstock.  Big “Simpsons” night last night.  Skinner and Krabbapel almost got married but she instead wound up having an affair with the Comic Book Guy.  Then they reran the classic episode spoofing “Evita.”  Then on “24”, Ryan Chappelle got whacked.  Meanwhile I taped “The Sopranos” and watched it afterwards.  Turns out that the actor who played Chappelle is also on “Sopranos”, as the conflicted priest, Father Phil.  Now that his “24” character is dead, he’ll have plenty of extra time to be on “Sopranos.”    So much work to do this week.  The busy season is upon us!

      I just saw "House of Sand and Fog".  What a great movie!  Battles for real estate have never been more dramatic.  Jennifer Connelly plays a woman who was wrongly evicted from her house, as the county claimed she failed to pay a tax that she didn't even need to pay.  But Connelly could have prevented it from happening had she bothered to open her mail!  Meanwhile, Ben Kingsley, a former Iranian colonel buys the house at auction and refuses to leave despite learning of Connelly's predicament.  I loved the depiction of Kingsley, his wife and his son.  Despite his financial stubbornness, it's clear that Kingsley only wants whats best for his family.  That makes the devastating events in the last half-hour of the film especially heartbreaking.  Go see this movie now!

      Just recently got back from a night out in Manhattan.  Don't feel like sleeping so I'll blog instead!  I'll add this to my previous post about chemistry.  There's nothing you can do about it.  It's either there or it's not there.  The best approach is not to take it too personally if it isn't happening.  For example, I'm confident that I'm a decent looking guy who is a good conversationalist with a witty sense of humor.  I can only be myself and, if that's not enough, then it's just not meant to be.  Can't think of anything else to say on the matter seeing as how it is after 2 in the morning!  Will blog more tomorrow!

      Chemistry.  I’ve always hated it in school.  Definitely my worst subject.  So once I fulfilled my requirements, I did not take any additional courses in it.  Now, years later, chemistry has again come back to haunt me in the dating world.  There’s nothing more frustrating than going out with someone, thinking it went well, and then being told that they don’t want to pursue anything because they “didn’t feel any chemistry.”  Grr.  That’s one of the perils of online dating sites like JDate.  If two people meet in the real world, then there’s a better chance of establishing mutual sparks before setting up a date.  But even if two people establish a good rapport online and on the phone, there’s no guarantees until they first meet in person.  Although it can be frustrating, I’m doing my best to stay optimistic and to keep trying!   I guess it pays to watch a TV program before offering a prediction on it.  “Survivor” addict that I am, I correctly forecasted Kathy’s departure.  But having never watched “The Apprentice”, I chose the wrong guy.  Turns out that Bill won, not Kwame.  My bad.

      Update :  Timber!!!  A huge 80-year old tree just fell in front of my office building in Prospect Park and caused quite a noise.  A combination of its age, health, wind conditions and the fact that its roots failed to sustain it.  It's a good thing noone was standing underneath it when it fell!  I also wanted to point out that there is a striking resemblance between Ariel Sharon and Tommy Lasorda.

      There’s one more Bush quote from Tuesday night’s press conference that I forgot to mention but is too irresistible not to :  “I wouldn’t be happy if I were occupied either.”  Yes, Mr. President.  We sure wouldn’t want you to be occupied.  That’s why Cheney does all your work for you.  The rains continue.  April showers ain't no cliche.  "The O.C." is such an addictive program.  It's so soapy but I can't turn away.    My "Survivor", who gets the boot prediction is Kathy.  With Lex gone she should be the next target for the united Chaperas.  That's assuming that the Chaperas remain united.  I think they will for at least one more vote.  I've never watched "The Apprentice" but, after reading a newspaper article about it, I'm predicting that Trump will hire the black guy.

      More fun excerpts from Bush’s press conference last night :  * A reporter asked, “In the last campaign, you were asked a question about the biggest mistake you'd made in your life and you used to like to joke that it was trading Sammy Sosa. You've looked back before 9/11 for what mistakes might have been made. After 9/11, what would your biggest mistake be?”  To which, Bush then looked like a deer caught in headlights as he stuttered “Hmmm. I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it... You know, I just — I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn't yet... You know, I hope I don't want to sound like I've made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't — you just put me under the spot here and maybe I'm not quick, as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one.”  They then cut to a shot of Karl Rove, Condi Rice and Andrew Card who looked mortified.  Had they not prepared him for such an expected question?  Or had they prepared him and Bush had forgotten what he was supposed to say?  * When asked who we will be transferring sovereignty to in Iraq on June 30, Bush responded “We’ll get back to you on that.”    * I loved when a reporter asked him “Will (Iraq) have been worth it, even if you lose your job because of it?” and then when another reporter asked “If you feel in any way that you’ve failed as a communicator?”    Now we know why Bush does not have too many press conferences.    In other news, congratulations to Barry Bonds for hitting his 661st home run last night and surpassing Willie Mays for 3rd on the all-time home run list.

      Who is this boob currently appearing on all the TV channels?  Oh yeah, Bush. He's currently in the middle of the press conference and at least the press is asking him some hardball questions this time around.  Their softball questions at his previous press conference (before the Iraq war) was inexcuseable.  When the reporter asked him how his faith served to inspire him I wanted to throw my shoe at the TV.  But that was last time.  This time, they're challenging him more over his mistakes and Bush is stammering through his talking points.  One noteable exchange was when he was asked why he will only appear before the 9-11 commission sitting alongside Cheney.  Bush answered that he looks forward to answering the commission's questions.  But when pressed why he wouldn't appear by himself, as the commission requested, he only repeated that he looked forward to meeting with them and moved on to the next question.  What a dodge!  Even the dumbest viewers had to pick up on that one.  More commentary on Bush's performance tomorrow when it's all said and done.

      Skies are overcast.  A mist is falling.  I walk through the streets wearing my black trenchcoat, looking like Morpheus and vowing to overthrow the rule of the machines.  How much do I despise George W. Bush?  Never mind that he stole the 2000 election.  Never mind that he dragged us into the quagmire of Iraq with no exit strategy.  Never mind that he blew the Clinton surplus by giving tax breaks to the rich.  I despise him because his press conference tonight is going to preempt “24”!!!  The guy’s got some nerve.   Improvement in fantasy baseball.  I shot up four places in the standings and am now in third place!  I’ll refrain from giving a daily commentary on this subject but will certainly mention if I reclaim my first place position.  Premiere Magazine published a list of The Top 100 Movie Characters.

Dobbs   “Treasure of the Sierra Madre”   3)  Scarlett O’Hara   “Gone With the Wind”   4)  Norman Bates   “Psycho”   5)  James Bond   “Dr. No”   6)  Annie Hall   “Annie Hall”   7)  Indiana Jones   “Raiders of the Lost Ark”   8)  Ellen Ripley   “Alien”   9)  Jeff Spicoli   “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” 10)  Gollum   “The Lord of the Rings”  Other noteables...  12)  Charles Foster Kane   “Citizen Kane” 13)  Atticus Finch   “To Kill a Mockingbird” 14)  Randle McMurphy   “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” 22)  Travis Bickle   “Taxi Driver” 27)  Marge Gunderson   “Fargo” 31)  Norma Desmond   “Sunset Boulevard” 38)  Willy Wonka   “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” 47)  Mrs. Robinson   “The Graduate” 59)  Lt. Kilgore   “Apocalypse Now” 63)  Carrie White   “Carrie” 75)  Dr. Strangelove   “Dr. Strangelove” 84)  Darth Vader   “Star Wars”  (should be higher!!!)

      What is going on?  The baseball season is one week old and my fantasy team has fallen from 1st to 3rd to 5th and now to 7th place!!!  At this pace I'll be in last place by Thursday.  Grr.  Even the real-life Mets are doing better than me.  Congrats to Phil Mickelson.  He's the golfer who won the Masters yesterday.  I like him because he has the same name as me.  And also because he seems like a genuinely nice guy who until yesterday had been the best player to never have won a major tournament.  Yay, Phil!  Some guy in Las Vegas bet his life savings on the spin of a wheel!  He bet over $100,000 on red.  And the winner was...red.  So now he has over $200,000.  Not a recommended method of investment though.  I think I'll stick with my 457 plan and Roth IRAs.

      Happy Easter.  Not a whole lot going on today.  Took my parents out to dinner last night to celebrate my dad's birthday.  Then I helped him set up his new DVD player which was a gift from my brother.  It was very frustrating to hear incredible distortions in the sound.  After wracking my brain over what was wrong, I realized that I had plugged the red cord into the wrong red outlet on the back of the player.  You see there were two reds.  If they would only come up with a variety of different colors we wouldn't have such problems.  All is now well on the technology front.  I also watched two Netflix movies this weekend.  The first was "Something's Gotta Give."  This was a fun movie, although a half hour too long.  You can't go wrong with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.  The second movie I watched was "Mona Lisa Smile".  I can understand why it got bad reviews since much of it was cliches, but I liked it anyway.  It took place at Wellesley College in 1953 and as a Vassar alum, I'd imagine that Vassar was very similar during that time.    I read an article in the newspaper about Anne Hathaway, star of "The Princess Diaries" and "Ella Enchanted."  It turns out that she is currently enrolled at Vassar but her movie career has seriously curtailed her advancement towards her degree.  She was originally enrolled in the Class of 2004 and, whereas her friends and classmates are currently getting ready to graduate, she has only completed three semesters.  I really wonder whether or not she will make the effort to continue.  Fantasy Baseball woes.  After two happy days in first place, my team has slipped to 5th.  It's all because of my pitching.  10 of my starters have made 14 starts thus far and I only have ONE win from them.  I'm counting on them all to rebound with better performances next time.

      One year after toppling the statue of Saddam Hussein, Iraq looks messier than ever.  Now a hostage situation has developed.  Three Japanese civilians are among the hostages and their captors are threatening to burn them alive unless Japan withdraws its troops.  Given all of this chaos, I don't see how we can implement a transfer of power by June 30.  The situation seems to be getting far worse before it gets better.  Sad news at the New York Aquarium.   urlLink Their 35-year old beluga whale, Kathy, passed away yesterday.   If you click on the link to its article, you'll find a mention of Aquarium spokesperson, Fran Hackett.  I work closely with Fran every year when planning events at Coney Island so, although its a sad occassion, its great to see her name in the national news media.

      Happy Birthday to my dad!!!  The streets of Brooklyn are utterly deserted today.  Must be a combination of no school and the religious holiday.  Lex got served last night on “Survivor”.  I’ve gotta say that Lex deserved it, having played the game very poorly.  He engineered the demise of those most loyal to him (Colby, Ethan, Jerri) and gambled everything on the assumption that Boston Rob would include him in a Final 4 alliance.  Wrong!  Rob cut him loose, preferring to stick to an alliance with his original tribe.  Lex never should have trusted Rob and now he paid for it.  Did you hear that 19,000 Hasidic Jews rented out Madison Square Garden yesterday for a private showing of the Ringling Bros. Circus?  All female performers were excluded, the men and women sat separately in the audience, and kosher cotton candy machines and other kosher food concessions were brought into MSG.  Must have been quite a sight.    I wish a Good Friday to all the goyim.

      Update : More thoughts on Condi Rice's testimony.  After denying any prior knowledge of Al Qaeda attacking within the U.S., the commissioners revealed that President Bush was presented with a memo on August 6, 2001 entitled "Bin Laden determined to attack inside United States."  Wow.  What was the response by our national security advisor?  That it was a historical document, detailing PAST efforts.  Um, then shouldn't it have been titled "Bin Laden USED TO BE determined to attack..."?  Now all 10 commissioners are urging that this document be declassified.  Dr. Rice also was questioned on why they didn't follow through on plans to attack Al Qaeda that were drafted by the Clinton administration.  Her response?  That there were no such plans, merely several actionable items listed together.  Um, isn't that a "plan"?

      Update : Condi Rice has finished testifying before the 9-11 commission.  As expected she refused to acknowledge that the administration made any mistakes or did anything wrong.  I particularly enjoyed the exchange between her and commission member Bob Kerrey.  Rice kept insisting that, prior to 9-11, Bush said he was tired of “swatting flies” with Al Qaeda and wanted a greater response.  Kerrey asked her “What flies did the administration swat?  Give me one example of when you swatted a fly!”  That was not terribly surprising since Kerrey is a Democrat.  But then James Thompson, the most partisan Republican on the panel, chided Rice for the administration’s failure to attack Al Qaeda after the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole.  She said that a “tit for tat response” was not appropriate.  He then asked her how many of our destroyers Al Qaeda would have had to attack before we would have deemed it appropriate.    All in all, I have to give the 9-11 commission credit.  It seems they are genuinely interested in determining what went wrong with our intelligence and the failure of our leaders to act upon known threats.  (That includes Clinton.  Even though I’m an admitted partisan Democrat, his administration must also be held accountable)  It will be very interesting to read the final content of their report.

      So I’m currently listening to Condi Rice’s testimony on my walkman.  She’s reading her carefully constructed opening statement.  It will be interesting to see how she responds to intense questioning by the panel and whether she relies on ambiguous statements like “In my opinion” or “To the best of my recollection.”  It will also be interesting to see how long it takes before she tries to decredit Richard Clarke.  “Survivor” is down to nine people, all of which will at least be on the jury.  CBS said that the merge will finally happen tonight and Boston Rob is in a position where he has made alliances with all remaining members.  The previews indicate that he is going to have to betray one of his alliances.  If the others had any sense, they would get wise to Rob’s antics and vote him off.  But they haven’t shown much sense thus far.  Despite Steve Traschel’s awful performance last night, I’m still in first place in Fantasy Baseball!  My hitters have a combined .380 batting average so far.  That makes up for my pitchers 5.something ERA.

      Passover Seder, Round Two was held last night in New Jersey.  Special thanks to my cousin Pamela for leading the seder.  It was really great to see her, her husband Mike and their two children, 2 and a half year old Grace, and 1 and a half year old Matthew.  Since they live in San Francisco we don’t get to see them as often as we’d like.  Those kids are so cute and intelligent!  It was also fun to hang out with my cousins Russell and Lisa.    And Uncle Norman is recovering well from the operation he had last month.  Now there’s nothing left to do but eat the leftovers.    (Pamela’s Passover tidbit : An orange slice can be put on a seder plate because when women were attempting to be ordained as rabbis, a prominent male rabbi angrily proclaimed “The day women are allowed on the pulpit is the day oranges will be put on seder plates!”.  So since women have indeed achieved positions as rabbis, it’s appropriate to add oranges as a nod to their achievements.)    (Russell’s Passover tidbit – if they do a spoof of the movie “Old School”, they should call it “Old Shul”)  How bout dem Mets?  I did not see the game last night but I heard that they kicked major ass.  A 7-2 win over the Braves with hot performances by Tom Glavine and Kaz Matsui.  And even better – my fantasy baseball team, Thugz Inc., is in first place!  I don’t know how long that will last so I will gloat as long as I can.

      One Passover seder down.  One to go.  Kudos to mom for making a great dinner last night.  It started with the traditional reading of the "New Hagaddah".  It's called "New" even though the books we use were published in 1948.  The seder began with this funny exchange...  Dad : "We'll begin on Page 3." Aunt : "Where's Page 3?" Brother : "It's after Page 2."  50 pages later and after a hearty singing of Dye-anu, we finally ate.  The menu featured gefilte fish, matzah ball soup, turkey, baked potatoes, corn, carrot tzimas, haroset, pickles, veggies, matzah, and all the Manischevitz you could drink.  Dessert had ring jells, marshmellow twists, fruit slices, and various sugar-free stuff for the diabetics.  Round two is tonight in New Jersey.  Front page of the Daily News proclaims that J-Lo's mom won $2.4 million in Las Vegas.  Like she needs it!  Some good news is that Ralph Nader failed to make the ballot in Oregon.  He had only 700 supporters turn out last night when there was a 1000 person minimum in order to qualify for the ballot.  At the same function four years ago, he had 7000 supporters turn out.  Maybe people are finally getting it.

      No work today because it's Passover!  T-minus a few hours until family descends upon Brooklyn for the first night's seder.  Stay tuned to this blog for a complete food review.  Today I am officially 26 and a half years old.  Does anyone still celebrate half-birthdays?  There was a great episode of "The Sopranos" last night.  It focused on Tony's infatuation with Adrianna and how they got into a car accident together at 2 in the morning from swerving off the road to avoid hitting a racoon.  Adrianna's fiance Christopher became enraged, thinking that the cause of the accident was oral sex.  There was a great montage of mobsters gossiping on the phone, embellishing the story of how it happened.  Chris then took the unprecedented step of attempting to assassinate Tony and wound up almost getting whacked himself.  Enter Steve Buscemi's character who urged everyone to drop their weapons and think rationally.  Buscemi took them to the hospital where Adrianna was treated and got the doctor to tell Chris that she had abrasions on her body from the seatbelt.  Hence, she could not have been engaged in any such acts and Chris had to apologize to Tony.  The episode ended with Chris, Adrianna, Tony, Tony's wife, Buscemi and Buscemi's mother all going out to dinner in public, encouraging the perception that there is peace.  The previews for next weeks episode indicate that its going to be all about Buscemi.

      How come nobody told me that today was Daylight Savings Time?!?  Boy was I surprised when I woke up this morning, thinking that it was 10:00 but that it was really 11:00!  There's a big rain downpour going on right now.  I was caught outside in it earlier and am now drying off.  Saw two Netflix movies yesterday.  The first was "The Rundown" with The Rock.  It was mindless yet enjoyable.  I met The Rock back in 1997 when he was known as Rocky Maivia.   urlLink Click here to see a picture of me and Rocky.   (It's the second one)   It's good to see him succeeding now as a big movie star.  He's certainly entertaining enough.  The second movie I saw was "Intolerable Cruelty".  Hated it!  It was hyped as a screwball comedy but there was nothing screwy or comedic about it.  I can't believe it took four people to write the screenplay to such a piece of dreck.  Avoid at all costs!

      Three of my friends have birthdays today so happy birthday to Jon Gans, Gabe Anderson and Andrew Chazen!  Yesterday I forgot to make a “Survivor” prediction.  The unlucky castaway to get the boot was Jerri the Bitch.  OK, maybe she wasn’t as bitchy as she was in Australia three years ago.  But she was still pretty damn annoying. With 9 players left, Rob and Amber remain in control as they have seemingly made alliances with everyone.  In other TV news, the shit finally hit the fan on “24”.  Or should I say, a biological virus hit the fan.  After chasing after the virus all season, it was finally unleashed within a hotel in L.A.  People inside the hotel didn’t waste anytime showing symptoms so it looks like there’s going to be quite the casualty count.  Unfortunately, Kim was not inside the hotel.  And be sure to check out reruns of “South Park” this weekend.  The episode was titled “The Passion of the Jew” and is a great satirical look at America’s interest in “The Passion of the Christ.”  The episodes main conclusion?  That Mel Gibson is insane.  So far so good with “Air America” radio.  I’ve been listening to “The O’Franken Factor” for the past two days and it’s pretty good.  Franken has a professional radio host co-hosting the show with him because he’s a novice to the genre.  But the content has been mostly satisfying.  So far they’ve interviewed Bob Kerrey, Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore, and Richard Reich.  Al Gore and Ben Stein called in and Bebe Newirth provided the voice of Ann Coulter who, as the skit went, got locked inside of a closet in the Air America studios.  Hopefully the station can soon get on the air in the swing states.   I hate to say it but it seems that the Mets are really going to stink this year.  They’re losing all of their spring training games, Jose Reyes is out with some mysterious leg ailment, Kaz Matsui is having a lot of trouble adjusting to U.S. pitchers and their starting rotation is still undecided.  I’d like to amend my original 4th place prediction.  I now say they will come in last.  But perhaps its best to enter the season with low expectations so any successes they do have will be a nice surprise.

      Today is April Fools Day.  That means that I don’t trust the veracity of anything that anyone may say to me today.  That includes you!  Last night I had a good time hanging out with Sarah, as well as her cute dog Zoey!  We saw “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” at the AMC theater on 42nd Street.  I thought the movie was very well done.  Jim Carrey proves that he’s a very effective actor when acting in serious, dramatic roles.  This has to rank up there with “The Truman Show” as one of his best performances.  I also enjoyed how Charlie Kaufman constructed the screenplay and the visual effects were unique as we witnessed the erasure of Carrey’s memory.  There’s a subplot with Kristin Dunst’s character that I could have done without but the central drama between Carrey and Kate Winslet is what pulls the film along.  I highly recommend this movie!  The Washington Post is reporting that on 9/11/01, Condoleezza Rice was originally scheduled to give a speech on the state of our national security.  It was to have focused on long-range missile defenses and would not have mentioned Al Qaeda, Bin Laden or Islamic-extremist terrorism at all.  I think this effectively proves that, prior to 9/11, terrorism was not the slightest priority for this administration.    Overheard on public transportation this morning : Girl : “What are you reading?” Boy : “The Autobiography of Malcolm X.” Girl : “You’re reading that on your own?” Boy : “Yeah.  What you think I’m retarded?” Girl : “No.  I’ve just think its great that a guy is reading without being forced to.  I’ve never seen that before” Boy : “Nah, this is great stuff.  Everyone should read this.”  That exchange put a smile on my face.  Even though I’m not the biggest fan of Malcolm X, I’m glad to see that reading isn’t entirely forgotten among urban youths.

      Sorry for the lack of recent blog postings this weekend.  I'm too busy relaxing.  Fans of this blog (if there are any!) will notice that I have posted a picture on the right-hand column, alongside my Blogger profile.  Yes, it's the same picture that's on Friendster.  I'm hoping to purchase a digital camera soon and once that happens, look for more pics on this site!

      I stayed up late last night finishing reading "Angels and Demons."  Just could not put it down.  It's a great book by Dan Brown, author of "The Da Vinci Code."  However, having read "Da Vinci", I am familiar with Brown's writing style and was therefore able to decipher the twist - who the villain was - halfway through the book.  Even though I had a good idea who the bad guy was, I still enjoyed how the author got us there and there was one final twist at the end that had me saying "Holy shit" out loud.  I know that Ron Howard is currently prepping a "Da Vinci" film and having now read "Angels and Demons", I really hope that a film version of it follows.  All I ask is that Ben Affleck NOT be cast as Robert Langdon.  Today they are dedicating the World War II Memorial in Washington D.C.  I'm watching it right now on The History Channel.  This year on Memorial Day, as we enjoy our beaches, BBQs and clothing sales, let's take some time to honor the sacrifices of all of our veterans, in wars both just and unjust.

      The beach opening went off without a hitch.  The weather cooperated, unlike last year when it rained on us.  I even got to meet the Mayor and he gave me a kazoo!  One of the many giveaways was souvenir kazoos donated by Astroland Amusement Park.  As Mayor Bloomberg walked in my direction, I stuck out my hand and introduced myself.  He shook it and said “Hello.  I am going to give you this.”  He then handed me a kazoo that someone else had previously given to him.  Quite the encounter!  Otherwise it was a long day but we got a lot of positive media coverage so I’m happy.  Since I subscribe to DirecTV, I don’t get the station NY1 anymore but I was told that I could be seen in one of the shots, with my back to the camera!  I also met a guy who works for the Disney Corporate Office in Florida.  He was vacationing in NYC and seemed very impressed with Coney Island.  Maybe he’ll go back to work and suggest that they invest, ala Times Square.  It was also great to have worked with the volleyball teams of Grady and Wingate High School, arranging for them to take part in the event by playing beach volleyball.  Those kids and their coaches were thrilled to be there and I was happy to have them.  But the best parts were what happened after the formal event ended... an unlimited lunch buffet courtesy of Greg & Paul’s and a ride on the Wonder Wheel.  Yay Coney Island!    As is the tradition, the beach opening ceremony is always followed by Memorial Day weekend, which is the perfect time to crash and burn.  I intend on doing just that.

      “24” went out with a bang last night.  Or should I say, a chop.  In one of the more gruesome scenes in the series’ history, Jack was forced to chop off Chase’s hand with an axe.  You see, he had no choice since Chase’s hand was permanently clamped to the deadly biological weapon that they had been hunting all year.  In other developments, President Palmer decided not to seek a second term, Tony is off to serve at least 20 years in jail, Saunders was killed by Gael’s widow, and Chase and Kim decided to live a calmer existance.  The final scene featured Jack privately sitting in his car, overcome with tears... the first time he ever cried on the show.  A quiet yet powerful conclusion.  “24” will not return until January, 2005 when FOX will then present it without any preemptions.  They might do so with Kiefer Sutherland but without many of the supporting players.  Busy week at work.  Busy busy busy.  Tomorrow’s blog entry will be entered a bit later than usual in order to provide a full recap of the Beach Opening Ceremony.

      Bush gave another speech last night.  Don’t know why I bothered to watch.  Maybe it was because nothing else was on.  Maybe it was because he was supposed to have laid out some actual specifics as to what our Iraq endgame would be.  Silly me.  It turned out to be little we haven’t heard before.  “We will transfer sovereignty by June 30... We will rebuild their security... We will rebuild their infrastructure.”  Yes, but how???  In terms of transferring sovereignty, Bush said that an envoy from the UN will decide who will be the new President, Prime Minister, VPs and cabinet members.  Sounds like that envoy should have been the one giving the speech instead.  Of course no mention was made of the very real possibility that a new Iraqi government would ask U.S. forces to leave the country.  Then what?  More speeches will be forthcoming in the next month and I really hope they are more illuminating.  Last winter I read “The Da Vinci Code” and really enjoyed it.  Now I’m reading “Angels and Demons,” the first Robert Langdon novel.  It’s very much in the “Da Vinci” formula and it reads like an season of “24”, fast paced, taking place in one day, with a race to stop a catastrophe from happening.  So far, so good!

      Was at Coney Island earlier this morning getting ready for the big Beach Opening event, which is on Thursday.  Today I was putting up the 2004 Event Calendar posters that I made on all of the informational kiosks.  So if you’re at Coney this summer and you see the good-looking promotional posters, know that it was all me!  As Cher said in “Moonstruck”... “I don’t believe in curses.”  To which the old Sicilian woman replied, “Neither do I.”  It’s obvious that neither of them are baseball fans.  Because true baseball fans know the power of a curse.  The plights of the Chicago Cubs and the Boston Red Sox are one example.  Another is that no Mets pitcher will ever throw a no-hitter.  Case in point – yesterday’s game.  Tom Glavine came within 4 outs of a no-no, only to be denied.  Through the years, the Mets have had many great pitchers... Tom Seaver, Dwight Gooden, David Cone.  All of whom never threw a no-hitter for the Mets but did so later in their careers after they left the team.  When I was a little kid I used to say that I would erect a statue in my frontyard of the first Met to throw a no-hitter.  As the years go by, it seems that is one statue that will never be built.  “The Sopranos” was AMAZING last night.  Full of action and drama!  Perhaps one of the best episodes ever.  Yet also disturbing.  It culminated in the whacking of Adrianna, a regular since the series’ inception.  Adrianna had been giving information to the FBI for the past two seasons and once the family found out... well let’s say she knew exactly what was going to happen as Sylvio drove her into the woods.  It was also a noteable episode as Tony Soprano refused to hand Steve Buscemi’s character over to the rival mob boss for a retribution killing.  Now it looks like full-fledged war between the two families.  Or to put it another way : Johnny Sack said to Tony, “You Got Served!”  To which Tony replied, “No, You Got Served!”  To which they resolved, “It’s On!”  Now if this were “South Park” it would culminate in a dance-off.  Don’t think that’s gonna happen though...

      Yesterday was busy.  Went to not one but two birthday parties.  Go social life!  One of the parties was in the afternoon and the other was late at night so I had some time to kill in between.  So I went to the McDonalds on 42nd Street and ordered a Number 3 Meal - SuperSized!  After gorging myself (and only being able to finish half the fries and soda), I then went to the AMC 25 theater and saw the film "Super Size Me."  It was awesome!  As I sat in the theater suffering from the effects of my own Mickey Ds binge, I watched Morgan Spurlock as he only ate McDonalds three times a day for thirty straight days.  As a result he gained 25 pounds, his cholesterol shot up, he suffered liver damage, had problems performing sexually, and suffered through bouts of depression.  But it sure tasted good!  Actually, only part of the movie dealt with his experiment.  The rest dealt with the American obesity epidemic in general.  It's a great film and a good companion piece to the book "Fast Food Nation."  Oh and on my way walking from the theater to the 2nd party, I passed three McDonald's.  They really have taken over Manhattan.  And speaking of documentaries, Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" won the Cannes Palmes D'Orr Prize last night as the best film.  Will definetely see that one as soon as it comes out!

      Did everyone hear about the interview with Condi Rice where she answered “As I said to my husb...I mean the President”  Yes, Ms. Rice was making a reference to Bush and the first words that almost blurted out of her subconscious when thinking of him were “my husband.”  Does Little Miss Condi have a crush???    The comic strip “The Boondocks” has jumped all over the flub, joking around that they’re having a steamy love affair.  In yesterday’s strip, Huey is watching a TV news interview with Rice and she tells a reporter, “As I was saying, we’re all horrified about the treatment of the detainees.  Why, I was just saying to my snoogumcakes...” (stunned silence)  “I – um – meant the President.”  To which Huey yells out “SHE DID IT AGAIN!!”

      The news is so gloomy.  Iraq is a mess.  The 9-11 hearings are contentious.  The Mets lost yesterday.  Nothing good in today’s paper to talk about.  Except for a humorous story about a insurance executive who was billed for $28,000 at Scores Strip Club.  He’s suing them for wrongful charges.  The spokesperson for Scores said that the lawsuit boils down to his “partying like a champ but waking up the next day feeling like a chump.”    The expense list is itemized as follows... $16,000 for Champagne   (5 magnums of Clos Du Mesnil at $3,200 each) $7,000 for Lap Dances   (350 for $20 each, including dances by up to 12 women at a time) $5,000 for more alcohol, food and tips  Well, I hope he had fun!

      Happy Birthday,  urlLink Sarah !!!  Now you are as old as me!  (Give or take seven months or so...)  NYC has made the Final Five cut for the 2012 Summer Olympics.  However in the voting, we only came in 4th, behind Paris, Madrid and London.  (Moscow is the other finalist)  I don’t think the odds are good that NYC will be chosen.  With the 2010 Winter Games in North America, they’ll probably choose one of the three European cities for 2012.  I’m disappointed though that Havana, Cuba failed to make the cut.  How great would that be?  Castro would never let anyone leave!  Congratulations to Randy Johnson on throwing a perfect game last night.  Not bad for 40 years old!  It’s even sweeter that he did it against the Atlanta Braves.  They’re not so tough this year, are they?  Add that to another 9th inning come-from-behind win by the Mets and it was a good night for baseball.  Television’s greatest villain, Sherry Palmer from “24”, was killed off last night.  She was the quintessential manipulater, always scheming against her husband and plotting her way to power.  All of her schemes finally caught up with her though as she was gunned down by one of the women who she betrayed.  In three years on the show, Penny Johnson Jerald did an amazing job in her portrayal of the character and she’ll be missed!

      I cannot wait to see “Fahrenheit 9/11.”  It’s the latest documentary from Michael Moore and it got a 20-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival.  Not surprising since the screening was in France and it really tears into the policies of the Bush Administration.  It includes a rarely seen 7-minute clip of Bush being informed that the second tower was struck, and then sitting in a kindergarten chair with a vacant, baffled look on his face.  It also shows war atrocities in Iraq with many of our own soldiers questioning what we’re doing.  Plans are for the film to be released in theaters this summer (provided that they find a distribution company) and then on video and DVD in the fall.  Hopefully it will be seen by many voters as a wake-up call.  Sad to say that Tony Randall of “Odd Couple” fame passed away this morning.  I met Randall in November, 1999 at the Marriot Marquis Hotel in NYC.  I was working with then-Parks Commissioner Henry Stern at a banquet in honor of City College.  Stern and Randall were both guest speakers and I had the pleasure of an introduction.  I wonder if Nick at Nite or TV Land will show an “Odd Couple” marathon in his honor.  Vassar College’s 5-Year reunion for the Class of ’99 is coming up!  June 4, 5, 6.  If you haven’t registered,  urlLink do so now at the AAVC home page!

      The front page of today’s Daily News asks “Would you pay $1,000 for an omelet?”  My answer is... no, I would not even pay $1 for an omelet.  I do not like omelets.  I do not like green eggs and ham either.  But apparently, Le Parker Meridian Hotel on W. 57th Street is charging a grand for an omelet that consists of eggs, lobster and lots and lots of caviar.  It was also reported that noone has ordered it yet.  Hilarious stuff on “Meet the Press”.  Colin Powell was being interviewed by Tim Russert via satellite from Jordan.  When Russert asked a hard-hitting question about using false information to justify war, Powell’s staffers moved the camera off of him and pointed it toward some palm trees.  His deputy press secretary told Powell that the interview was over but Powell yelled at them to put the camera back on him so he could answer the question.  Powell later called Russert to apologize.    Great Mets game yesterday.  After being shut out by Roger Clemens for 7 innings, the Mets got even with the Houston bullpen in the 9th as Mike Piazza hit the game-tying homer.  For Piazza its an indirect form of revenge against Clemens.  Who will ever forget the beaning he took in the head during the 2000 season?  Then in extra innings, Jason Phillips hit the game-winning home run.  “The Sopranos” was certainly surreal last night.  Much of the episode was an enactment of Tony’s dream, breaking all rules of time and space and bringing back many of the show’s former cast members who had been whacked in previous episodes.  The dream reflected much of Tony’s inner torments and anxieties and foreshadowed the troubles he is soon going to face.  Steve Buscemi’s character (Tony’s cousin) murdered a member of a rival mob family and now Tony fears that his family is at risk for retaliation.  The last two episodes of the season should be great!

      This morning I went to Lundy's (a Sheepshead Bay institution) for a breakfast in honor of Congressman Anthony Weiner (who used to be my boss many many years ago!)  It was great to see him and catch up with many of the people who I used to work with including Jeremy Halperin, Brian Gottlieb and Suzanne Bressler.  Now the only question is if Weiner will run for Mayor next year.  Hmm...  Speaking of Sheepshead Bay institutions, Roll 'n Roaster has been a hallmark on Emmons Avenue for the past 33 years.  They just recently opened a restaurant in Manhattan, on 3rd Ave & E 11th St, and I ate there last night.  Tasted the same to me!  Saw "Mean Girls" last night.  Sharp, funny movie that was highlighted by Lindsay Lohan's... ummm... assets.  When does she turn 18?

      Special thanks to Marivel for e-mailing this to me...  Have you heard of the NO-CARB Diet for 2004?  NO C-heney NO A-shcroft NO R-umsfeld NO B-ush  and "Absolutely NO RICE!"  This is a diet that will take you successfully through the next election.  -----------------------------------------------------------  Yesterday's Parks event was a ribbon cutting at Police Officer Reinaldo Salgado Playground in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  It was for a new synthetic turf ballfield, replacing an asphalt one.  Definetely a good thing for all the kids who will be using it.  Got up early this morning and watched "The Last Samurai."  Lots of exciting battle scenes and an engrossing historical epic of Japan's transition in the late 19th Century.  And yeah, Tom Cruise was good too.

      There is nothing more soothing than listening to the rain fall as you settle down to sleep.  Last night was great in that regard.  When I heard that Bruce Ratner was going to build a new arena complex for the Nets in Brooklyn, I originally felt bad for the homeowners that would be displaced.  Now I hear that all property owners have been offered over $1 million to move.  Suddenly I don't feel too bad for them anymore.   Another Parks event going down today.  It's at 1:00 though which will severely cut into my lunch.  Hmm, will have to grab something on the way.  Am determined to see a movie (or two!) this weekend.

       RUPERT!!!!!!     Rupert won the million dollar vote, no doubt thanks to all the votes that me, my dad, my aunt and my co-workers threw to him.    Yeah, Rupert!!!  OK, no more Survivor talk for a while.

      Saw an excellent movie the other night.  "Osama", the first movie made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban.  It's about a family of women who are starving to death because all the men in the family are dead and the Taliban bans women from working to earn a living.  So they cut the hair off their youngest daughter and have her pose as a boy in order to work.  Meanwhile, all the young boys in the village are rounded up to serve in Bin Laden's army - including her.  It's an amazing film and very reminiscient of "Europa Europa", where a Jewish boy pretends to be German in order to escape the Holocaust and even serves in Hitler Youth.  Terrible, terrible pictures out of Iraq.  First there's the prisoner abuse photos.  Then there's the beheading of the American.  It's as if the terrorists are saying "Oh you think you're sick?  Watch what we can do."  Voting for the next Survivor million dollar winner has closed with the winner to be announced tonight.  I voted for Rupert a few times.  I tried to vote for myself but did not see my name on the ballot.

      Said goodbye to Tom Stofka today.  His funeral was the first Catholic one that I have ever attended.  Literally hundreds of people were there, with Parks employees filling the church pews all the way to the back.  Across the street from the church, a forestry climber & pruner truck was parked with lettering that read "We Love You Tom Stofka."  An honor guard of Parks supervisors and enforcement officers stood at attention at the front doors.  The priest and Commissioner Benepe both spoke exceptionally well in their eulogies.  Tom will certainly be missed.  He was a highly thoughtful and insightful individual.  He and his wife would leave notes to each other every so often with positive affirmations on life.  The day that he died, his wife found a note from him that he apparently wrote that morning before he left for work.  A coincidence or did he have an inkling that something might happen?  This is what he wrote...  - Want more for others than yourself - Be an appreciator - Stay in rapport with source energy - Understand resistance - Contemplate yourself surrounded by the conditions you want to create - Meditate connected to source - Stay matched with the field of intention - Think from the end - visualize results - You can resolve a problem by condemning it - Be in a constant state of gratitude - Practice radical humility  Thank you Tom for leaving us with those final, valuable words.  And thank you for living the life that you led.

      Woah.  Blogger sure changed its visual interface last night.    And the winner of "Survivor : All Stars" is... Amber!  I picked it!  Rupert was first to go, then Jenna, then Amber beat Boston Rob by a 4-3 vote.  Voting for Amber was Shii Ann, Lex, Alicia and Tom (the latter three were out of spite for Rob).  Voting for Rob was Rupert, Jenna and Kathy.  Then on the live reunion show, Rob proposed marriage to Amber and she accepted.  What a Survivor love story.  I hope she signs a pre-nup. :)  The "big surprise" was something of a letdown.  It's that CBS will award a second million dollar prize in a "viewer's choice poll."

      HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!  Can't wait to go out to dinner tonight and eat lobsters with mom.  Tonight is the big finale of "Survivor : All Stars".  All season I've been offering my weekly picks and it all culminates tonight.  The first elimination will be interesting.  Rob and Amber are an alliance.  So are Rupert and Jenna.  Will it be a 2-2 tie?  If so, what's the format for a tiebreaker?  Will one of the players abandon their alliance to secure a 3-1 edge?  Then when it comes down to 3 players, it's all about who wins the final crucial immunity challenge.  The unpredictable nature of the final four makes predictions difficult but here goes.  I'll say that Rupert is the first voted out.  Then Boston Rob.  Then the jury will choose between Amber and Jenna and they'll give the win to Amber.  CBS is hyping huge surprises for tonight, which could be anything!

      Thanks to John and Spencer for throwing a supremo BBQ tonight!  Though, a BBQ before Memorial Day?  Isn't that sacriligious?  Mmm, sacrilicious...  So after meeting David McCullough on Friday, I went to the bookstore and purchased his book, "John Adams".   I enjoy his references to the journals that Adams kept when he was in his late teens & early twenties.  His journal entries sound no different than the blog entries that me and many of my friends write nowadays.  Just think, if John Adams was alive today, he'd have a blog!

      Still devastated about Tom Stofka’s death.  But life goes on.  A bunch of us went out last night for food and drinks, and we talked about Tom as well as other things.  I think the camaraderie helped us cope.  In his honor, American flags in Brooklyn’s parks are at half-mast.  So how about the shit hitting the fan about the abuse treatment of Iraqi prisoners?  Rumsfeld is in trooouuubbbllleee...  Apparently, Rumsfeld knew about it for months and hid the reports from Bush.  Yesterday, Bush had to actually use the word “sorry”.  This administration never apologizes for anything!  We very may well have a new Secretary of Defense before it’s all said and done.  And now a few TV commentaries.   1) Big Tom Buchanan was voted off of “Survivor” last night.  He could have played the role of a crucial swing vote but neither alliance felt they could trust him for the duration.  The final four is now Boston Rob, Amber, Rupert and Jenna with the finale to be aired on Sunday night.   2) I caught the last half-hour of “Friends” last night and was not impressed.  I never really watched the show to begin with and couldn’t care less that it’s off the air. 3) The season finale of “The O.C.” was the other night.  For the first time, a party on that show did not end with a fistfight or someone getting thrown into a pool.  Very sad ending though with Ryan going back to Chino out of obligation, and against his wishes.  I think it’s pretty clear though that he’ll move back to the Cohen’s house very early next season.  And what was with Seth sailing off into the sunset?  Gabe raises a good point, he’ll probably wind up drowning! 4) “24” is down to its last few episodes and Tony Almeida’s character has absolutely lost it.  Blackmailed by the bad guy, Tony has betrayed his country and directly put the lives of millions at risk.  Can’t wait for Jack to dole out his brand of justice.  A litany of bullets in Tony’s head perhaps?  Worked for Nina.  How bout those Mets?  They still stink but at least they swept the San Francisco Giants.  Guess the Giants aren’t much of team when Barry Bonds doesn’t play.  And my Fantasy Baseball team is even doing a little better.  If you can call 5th/6th place a little better.  I really want to see "Super Size Me", the documentary about the guy who only eats McDonalds for 30 days.    Have a good weekend!

      Well this has been some day thus far.  This morning, there was a groundbreaking ceremony at Sternberg Park.  The event itself went well.  However, I then returned to the office and learned that one of my co-workers, Tom Stofka, died this morning of a massive heart attack.  He was Brooklyn's Forestry Director and a great guy who I've worked with for five years.  I'm still in disbelief as I type this.  I last saw him yesterday and come to think of it, he did look a little flush.  Then, five minutes before I learned of his death, I "cc'd" him on an e-mail.  So right now we're all just sitting around the office, stunned.  Tonight we're supposed to go out and have drinks with Lauren, who left the agency last week.  I'm still going to go out but I don't know how much of a celebration its going to be.  "Survivor" is down to five.  Anyone could go at this point.  Big Tom is a crucial swing vote as Rob and Amber, and Rupert and Jenna seem like they're going to stick together.  My prediction is that Tom sides with Rob and Amber and chooses to vote off Rupert.  But I hope that doesn't happen.

      The following was posted today by  urlLink The Anonymous Blogette .  It's a great piece and I have decided to reprint it in its entirety.   SINGLE PERSON'S BILL OF RIGHTS   1. I have the right to do something on my own without being subject to A) incredulity and B) pity. If I say I did something alone, do not look at me as if to say, "Awww, you didn't have anyone to do it with?" Maybe it was my choice. Maybe it was easier than dragging someone else along who was not as into the activity. If I stop at my favorite restaurant to eat alone right after work, I may have not wanted to base my schedule on someone else's on that particular eve.  2. I have the right to give, as an answer for why I can't meet up with you, that I'm busy and not have to justify it. Just because I'm single doesn't mean each evening is free. If I were married, you wouldn't be holding me responsible for having to turn down some of your invites. You'd assume I have a life. Well, I am single, and I want to do things with you, but I *still* have a life. Just because I don't have to change diapers today doesn't mean there aren't things I need to get done. Don't quiz me on what I am doing if I turn you down. It's nothing personal. I may have planned some alone time. Please keep asking, as I would do the same with you.  3. I have the right to, on the one hand, value my alone time, and on the other hand, still want to seek out someone to share my life with, without being called a hypocrite or judged on it. I can be happy alone, but I might be happier with someone, IF it was the right person. These are not warring impulses. How hard is that to understand?  4. I have the right to expect that you will be looking out for someone for me to date. Yes, I do...Listen up: Are you a true friend? Well, the best way for people to meet is through friends. If you are a true friend, rather than doing #1 and #2 above, you will, upon meeting someone who is single and whom I might like, find out more about them and pass the info to me or see if they might like to meet me. It might be the nicest thing you can do for me.   I am trying to do this on my own as much as I can, but could use extra pairs of eyes. Dating services are awkward. Meeting appropriate people and getting to know them is HARD. Just look at  urlLink the blogs of my brothers and sisters in arms.   5. I have the right to complain about dating. If you haven't been out there and experienced it in a while, don't criticize me. Instead, re-read #4. And if I find someone, I won't be complaining about dating anymore.

      The website I alluded to the other day is coming along nicely.  Stay tuned to this blog for the grand announcement of its domain name.  It will herald a new era in the Internet!  My apologies to Jay Bartow.  Upon arriving home last night, I switched off my cell phone.  It’s a habit since I usually use the cell during the day and then my home phone at night.  Besides, my cell doesn’t get good reception in my apartment.  Anyway, I later turned on the cell to find a voicemail message from Jay yelling “I’m driving through Brooklyn and am completely lost!  Help me find a way out of here!”  Oops.  Sorry I didn’t get your message when you needed it, Jay.  Hope you found your way out sooner or later.  Hilarious sketch on SNL last weekend!  It featured Rachel Draitch as “Debbie Downer”, a woman who always knows how to ruin a good mood.  While everyone else is having a good time she adds comments about diseases, natural disasters, terrorism and how she can’t have children.  It was supposed to have been played completely deadpan but the entire SNL cast including Lindsey Lohan kept cracking up and breaking character throughout the entire sketch and that made it even funnier.  Sure to become an SNL classic.  When 9-11 happened, I figured that it would end Hollywood’s habit of making disaster movies.  Surely, after witnessing the actual collapse of the Twin Towers, who could stomach such similar fictional scenarios?  Well it’s been two and a half years since 9-11 and disaster movies are back.  Case in point, “10.5”, a miniseries aired for the past two nights on NBC.  Yes, the acting was terrible and ridiculously melodramatic but noone watches disaster movies for the acting.  We just want to see shit get destroyed.  Well “10.5” gave us the destruction of the Seattle Space Needle, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the entire coastline of Southern California.  Soon Hollywood will give us “The Day After Tomorrow”, where the entire world goes to hell!  So soon after 9-11, is this in the best taste?  I guess the ratings and box office will tell.

      Maybe I should have placed some money on Imperialism after all.  Although he did not win the Kentucky Derby, out of 18 horses, he came in a very respectable 3rd.  Supposedly you can bet that a horse will come in "place" which means that you'd win $$$ if they finish in 3rd or higher.  Guess I should have done that.  Ah well, that'll be my plan for the Preakness Stakes!  Saw two good movies on Netflix yesterday.  One was "Shattered Glass".  Just as Hayden Christensen plays Anakin Skywalker in Episode II as a whiny bitch, he plays Steven Glass, the New Republic reporter who faked his articles, as... a whiny bitch.  Guess it works for him.  The second movie I saw was "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton."  Standard formulaic teen romantic comedy...but it had heart!  Or something like that.  Now I need to drag my ass to an actual movie theater and see "13 Going on 30" and "Mean Girls".    Stay tuned to this blog for an announcement of a new, innovative website that will be of interest to most of my readers.  I will write more when more details become available!

      Yesterday was so busy that I didn't have time to blog!  It was Arbor Day (a big deal for the Parks Dept) and we had two events to celebrate it.  The first was at Carroll Park in Carroll Gardens and the second was at Kaiser Park in Coney Island.  I was only supposed to have been at one of them but wound up at both when the programs were left behind at the office and I was the only one available to bring them over.  The weather was great though so it was ideal to have been outdoors all day.  Then my mom had knee surgery yesterday on a torn miniscus.  All went well and she is currently home and recovering nicely.  I've never bet on horse racing before but I was walking past an OTB this morning and I became highly tempted.  Today is the Kentucky Derby and I considered placing a bet on a horse.  I ultimately decided not to, seeing as how I know nothing about the horses and that it would likely be a complete waste of cash.  However the horse's name that caught my eye was "Imperialism."  So if Imperialism does indeed win today, then I might have to trust my gut in the future.  If Imperalism loses, I'll just forget the whole thing.  I just heard that U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter got beat up last night by a bunch of young punks while he was jogging.  That sucks.  Couldn't they have targeted Scalia instead?  (Kidding!)

      Today is the last day of June.  It has been a very long, busy and enjoyable month.  Seeing as how it is the end of the fiscal year, I came into work this morning and found a plethora of new office supplies waiting for me at my desk.  Stationary, envelopes, staples, paper clips, white out...  it was like Christmas morning!  Nicole Kidman, goddess of the cinema, is having problems meeting men.  Her words from a recent interview : "I'm hoping to meet someone and be happy with them. But that's not as easy as it sounds. I'm a 37-year-old woman with two children. Men aren't beating a path to my door.  I don't want to sound like a woman from a lonely hearts club and I don't want to advertise. The children are my priority. I take them around with me... and that's not so appealing for any new man on the scene, is it?"  C’mon guys, any volunteers???  The final four women left at Wimbledon are Sharapova, Davenport, Amelie Mauresmo and Serena Williams.  Earlier this morning, Serena spanked Jennifer Capriati 6-1, 6-1.  And the pride of Great Britain, Tim Henman, lost again.  A perennial semifinalist, this year he lost in the quarters.  Poor Brits.

      The debate over “Fahrenheit 9/11” continues!  Commentaries can be found on Wendy’s blog and Val’s blog.  (see the links on the sidebar)  I am also attaching a link from  urlLink Denis Hamill’s article from today’s Daily News .    This just in!  The Supreme Court ruled that underage kids can look at porn on the internet.  Their reasoning had to do with free speech.  I don't fully comprehend it but I cracked up laughing when I heard that the five who voted in the majority were the four liberal justices and CLARENCE THOMAS!  Perv...  I’ve been in a mood for documentaries these past few months.  Last night I watched “The Fog of War.”  It is an interview with former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and his take on the Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam.  Some of his insights are remarkable.  With reference to the Cuban Missile Crisis, it’s amazing how close the world came to nuclear war.  It’s a good thing that Kennedy and Khruschev were both rational individuals, as Castro admitted to McNamara years later that he had urged Khruschev to use the nukes!  And with reference to Vietnam, it’s a classic case of two sides not being able to understand the other’s point of view.  America viewed it through the prism of the Cold War.  The North Vietnamese viewed it through the prism of a civil war.  Now that McNamara is in his 80s, he is able to speak openly about his regrets and it is refreshing to hear a policymaker admit that they even have any regrets!   There is a new 17-year old tennis talent from Russia named Maria Sharapova.  Today she won her quarterfinal match at Wimbledon and is now in the semifinals where she will meet Lindsay Davenport.  Sharapova is being called the second-coming of Anna Kournikova as, not only is she a young talent from Russia, but she is also quite the looker.  Let’s hope that, unlike Kournikova, the fame won’t go to her head and she can concentrate on her tennis.

      It was a very fun weekend what with the “Fahrenheit 9/11” outing, the day at Coney Island on Saturday, and a return to Coney on Sunday to take my parents to a Cyclones game.  This time, the Crappers beat them by a score of 6-5.  To which I said “Oh Crap!”  But there’s lots of news to talk about on this Monday morning.  After months of anticipating the June 30 transfer of sovereignty in Iraq, they instead did it two days early this morning with little fanfare.  How anticlimactic.  It’s like changing Christmas to December 23.  Now I have to call the caterer and cancel the party I was going to throw on Wednesday.  Kidding of course.  No doubt, the date was moved up and not publicized in order to prevent terrorists from attacking during the ceremony.  How effective will the new Iraqi leaders be against the insurgents?  Can they convince other Arab nations to embrace their legitimacy?  Or will they just serve as American puppets?  Lots of questions remain to be answered.  In other news from Iraq, an American Marine of Muslim descent was captured and is threatened for a beheading.  The terrorists are claiming that they infiltrated one of our camps and captured the marine.  The Pentagon is claiming that the marine deserted days ago and must have been captured elsewhere.  Who to believe?  Michael Moore is having a very good morning.  “Fahrenheit 9/11” was the #1 movie at the box office this weekend.  This is even more impressive considering that it was only playing on over 800 screens whereas the #2 flick, “White Chicks”, was on around 2500 screens.  What’s even better is that the film’s popularity is not confined to the blue states.  Theaters were sold out all over the red states that voted for Bush in 2000.  Its success is now prompting distributors to release it in even more theaters.  This film looks like its going to have some considerable staying power!  Here’s an interesting story.  Tiffany Schley, the valedictorian of the High School of Legal Studies in Brooklyn, gave a graduation speech where she criticized the school for its failure to provide resources and address student’s concerns.  This is obviously a very smart and astute girl as she will be attending Smith College on a full scholarship.  After giving the speech, she returned to the school to pick up her diploma and was barred from the building and denied the diploma out of sheer retaliation for her speech!  How repressive is that?!?  Only after the Daily News exposed the story did the school relent and grudgingly agree to give her the diploma.  Mayor Bloomberg had it right when he decried the school’s administrators as “bozos” who tried to deny her freedom of speech.

      Saturday was a great day as I gave  urlLink Sarah  a complete tour of Brooklyn.  We started in Prospect Park, visited my office on the way, lunched at Two Boots, took the train to Coney Island, watched the Mermaid Parade, gawked at barely and strangely dressed people, walked on the beach, went on the Wonder Wheel and Thunderbolt, and then saw a Brooklyn Cyclones game.  They beat the Mahong Valley Scrappers, 4-3.  Or as Sarah likes to call them, the Crappers!  Pictures are posted below.

      "Fahrenheit 9/11" is just as amazing as I thought it would be.    It goes like this.  The Bush Administration seized power by a fraudulent vote in Florida and exploited the September 11 terrorist attacks to pump up fear, tamp down dissent, enrich its cronies and, ultimately, to launch an ill-advised war against Iraq - on the dubious grounds that Saddam Hussein was somehow in league with Al Qaeda.  Michael Moore's telling of this narrative is enthralling and always entertaining.  He begins by showing Al Gore's victory celebration on Election Night 2000 and wondering "Were the past four years just a bad dream?"  We then see details of how Florida was rigged for Bush and his inauguration on a rainy day with huge protests in the streets and eggs being thrown at the motorcade.  Prior to 9/11, Bush is shown as laid back and ineffective.  His vacation for the entire month of August, 2001 is emphasized by the song on the soundtrack : "Vacation, all I ever wanted.  Vacation, time to get away."  (The song remained stuck in my head for the entire film)  Then 9/11 is handled well by showing a black screen with the sounds of the airplanes crashing.  Video is shown of Bush learning of the second plane hitting the tower and then sitting in a Florida classroom for a full seven minutes, with a vacant stare on his face and reading "My Pet Goat."  We then learn how the administration made sure that all members of the Bin Laden family were safely flown out of the country without being detained for questioning.  We also learn about the Bush family's ties with Saudi Arabia and the Bin Laden family in their oil business.  Moore raises the point : "If you earned $400,000 in salary from taxpayers as President, and millions from Saudi Arabian oil interests, who would you be the most loyal to?"    Moore then explores the Patriot Act (most members of Congress didn't have time to read it before voting for it), the color coded terrorist threat warnings (used to induce fear), the insufficient job of defending the homefront (a national parks staffer complains that their budget is nonexistant), and the military's emphasis on recruiting among the poorest classes where the military is their best shot of going to college.  Finally Moore gets to Iraq where precious resources needed to hunt Bin Laden in Afghanistan were diverted.  It is demonstrated that the administration pushed for war with Iraq from the beginning, even though the case could be made that Saudi Arabia was more responsible for 9/11.  We see first-hand the devastation suffered by innocent Iraqi civilians.  We also see the death and injuries of many of our own troops.  The kicker is his interviews with the mother of a U.S. soldier.  In the beginning, she supports the war and the administration.  But after her son is killed and she receives his last letter where he writes that Bush sent him there for no reason, she changes her mind and asks what the point of this war was, going as far as traveling to Washington D.C. to stand outside of the White House gates and demand answers.  It's heartbreaking and riveting.  Even if Bush feels that he doesn't owe anything to Michael Moore, he does owe a damn good explanation to each of the families who lost their loved ones in a war that was fought under false pretenses.  To sum up, everyone must see this movie.  I went with my friend Kerry and some of her friends and, to us, it felt like Moore was preaching to the converted.  What we need to do is to bring Republicans and undecided voters to see this movie, especially those who live in the swing states.  Kerry raised a good point in that some people might be turned off by the partisan manner in which Moore mocks Bush.  But even if they don't buy some of Moore's points, there are others that will give them serious pause about Bush and his cronies.  On a side note about the theater I saw the movie at.  It was the Loews on 34th Street and 8th Avenue.  It was the first time I'd been to a theater where they had reserved seating up front, with food menus for the concession stands and ushers who take orders and bring food to your seat!  At the movies!  Unreal.

      With one week to go until the Iraqi transfer of sovereignty, all hell has broken loose.  This morning alone, there were a wave of coordinated attacks that have resulted in at least 83 people dead and 233 wounded.  Threats have been made on the life of the new Iraqi Prime Minister.  All in all I’d say that things are going badly.  Not exactly the rosy scenario promised by Cheney and Rumsfeld before the war.  As a matter of fact, Democratic Senator Joseph Biden had a recent meeting with Bush and Cheney.  When asked what he would do about resignations following the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, Biden replied, “Look, Mr. President, would I keep Rumsfeld?  Absolutely not.”  Then he turned to Cheney and said “Mr. Vice President.  I wouldn’t keep you either.”  He went on to tell Bush that Cheney and Rumsfeld were “dead wrong on every major piece of advice they’ve given you.”  What was the reaction from Bush and Cheney?  According to Biden, “They said nothing.  Just sat like big old bullfrogs on a log and looked at me.”  Maybe they’re in a bad mood about something.  I’m a huge tennis fan.  Every year I go to the U.S. Open and at this time of year, I always enjoy watching coverage of Wimbledon.  Except this year, the rains have hit London pretty hard.  This is the fourth day of the tournament and they are still playing 1st round matches.  The big story of this Wimbledon has to be the comeback of Martina Navratilova.  She’s 47 years old and the other day she beat a player half her age.  Let’s see how she fares in her second round match.  And speaking of tennis, a movie called “Wimbledon” is coming out this fall.  It will star Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany.  Should be good!  (I hope!)  Last night I was talking with my new friend Caitlyn and we were discussing recent vacations that we’ve been on.  It occurred to me that I haven’t had a vacation where I went somewhere that lasted more than 4 days in YEARS.  Part of the problem is that I usually do not have a traveling companion so Caitlyn suggested that I use this blog as a forum to gauge if anyone else has the traveling itch.  So here it is, as I really need to get out of this city!

      Al Qaeda beheaded the South Korean.  Bastards.  So I started reading my long-awaited Bill Clinton book last night and I wasn’t five pages in before my eyelids started feeling heavy.  What separates this from say “Harry Potter” novels is that in “Harry Potter”, it’s an adventure where you can’t wait to turn the pages and find out what happens.  In this case, you read about Clinton’s life and say “Oh yeah, I remember that.”    Last night, the American Film Institute presented their list of the Top 100 Movie Songs of all time.   urlLink The full list can be found here.   No surprise, is that “Over the Rainbow” was #1 and “As Time Goes By” was #2.  It seems that each time AFI does a Top 100 list, “Wizard of Oz” and “Casablanca” rank at the top.  Some other selections include... 35-  “America”   (West Side Story) 40-  “Fight the Power”   (Do the Right Thing) 58-  “Gonna Fly Now”   (Rocky) 74-  “Rainbow Connection”   (The Muppet Movie) 80-  “Springtime for Hitler”   (The Producers) 85-  “Come What May”   (Moulin Rouge) 93-  “Lose Yourself”   (8 Mile)  The Mets are one game over .500!  They are now a winning team!  Enjoy it while you can folks...

      Guess who was the first person to buy Bill Clinton’s autobiography at the Barnes & Noble in Park Slope?  Me!  I walked by just as they were opening at 9:00 A.M. and made a beeline to the Clinton display (along with about 15 other people).  But I was the first to pay for it!  And it was cheap too.  In addition to it being marked for 30% off, I got an additional 10% for being a member, and then an additional 15% on top of that from a B&N coupon that I got in the mail.  I can’t wait to read about his battle with Voldemort... oh wait, wrong series.  Well in lieu of a Harry Potter book this year, this will probably be the publishing industry’s big hit.  And if it sucks, I can always use it for weight training purposes.  The cartoon on my Dilbert desk calendar :  The scene is a restaurant.  A waitress is taking Dilbert’s order.  Dilbert :  “Give me $35 worth of food, including your 15% tip.” Waitress :  “If I bring you a penne pasta, will you promise to not build a log cabin on your plate?” Dilbert :  “I can’t promise that.” Waitress :  “Well then.  We have a situation here.”  And this was yesterday’s cartoon.  Dilbert is sitting at the restaurant table by himself :  Dilbert :  “I’m not a loser who can’t get a date.  I’m a business traveler.” Waitress :  “What’s your girlfriend’s name?  I’ll call her and check your story.” Dilbert :  “Maybe I should order.” Waitress :  “Maybe you should.”

      Happy Belated Fathers Day!  A good time was had yesterday as I went out to dinner with my parents, brother, aunt and uncle.  My brother drove up from Baltimore on Friday and went home last night after dinner.  In between meals and movies, much of his time was spent working on fixing my dad’s computer.  It seems that computer problems always arise when he is in town.  Two years ago, my computer crashed and my brother had to install Windows XP on it.  It’s good to have a tech wizard in the family!    I’m sickened by the beheadings in the Middle East.  First Nick Berg.  Then Paul Johnson.  Now a South Korean translator has been abducted and will also be beheaded at sundown if South Korea does not withdraw their troops.  Although Berg and Johnson seemed resigned to their fates, the Korean was videotaped bawling in hysterics.  To hear his cries on the radio this morning was devastating.  And now, doing a total 180, how about them Mets?  Winners of four in a row, a three game sweep of the Tigers, two game-winning hits by Mike Cameron, the debut of Richard Hidalgo, the return of Jose Reyes, an even won-loss record and they are only two and a half games out of first place.  Let’s hope they can improve from here!

      Romantic comedies aren't exactly my favorite film genre, but I just saw an amazingly sweet one.  It's called "Love Actually" and it's a great piece of ensemble storytelling.  Each plotline is unique yet compelling in its own way.  There's Hugh Grant as the Tony Blair-ish Prime Minister, who falls for one of his aides.  There's Emma Thompson married to Alan Rickman, who is tempted by his secretary.  There's Liam Neeson who, after his wife passes away, bonds with his 10-year old stepson and advises the boy through his first puppy love.  There's Laura Linney who longs for her co-worker yet denies her own needs for those of her mentally disabled brother.  There's Keira Knightly who marries one man yet is longed for by the man's best friend.  There's the aging pop singer who realizes that he'd rather spend time with his loyal manager than to any of the women he can have.  There's the awkward English guy who goes to America to pursue his goal of finding hot American chicks who will sleep with him just because he's British.  And there's many many other story lines that all weave together very well.  Highly recommended!  Today I took a LONG exam (nearly 4 hours) for the title of "Staff Analyst."  For a couple of weeks prior to the exam, I was studying past questions dealing with flow charts and their crazy symbols (i.e. a diamond is a decision, a rectangle is a process, a triangle is storage).  Fortunately, none of that was even on the test!  I guess they decided to update the test from its 1930s incarnation.  While waiting on line to get into the test, I think I was hit on.  I'm not sure, I'm bad about figuring those things out.  But she gave me her business card and wrote her cell phone number on it.  But then she said something about her boyfriend.  I'll never understand women!

      This time of year is just insane for me.  Never mind all of the ribbon cuttings, park openings and check presentations.  Never mind the increased number of permit requests.  The craziest part of this time of year is that June 30 is creeping up on us.  No, I’m not talking about the Iraqi transfer of sovereignty.  I’m talking about the end of the NYC Fiscal Year.  It’s a mad rush to get all of the paperwork in to document expenses and ensure that they are credited to this year’s account.  It may not be exciting but it’s sure been keeping me busy!  The 9-11 Commission announced yesterday that there is no evidence that Iraq had anything to do with Al Qaeda or with the terrorist attacks.  Did you hear that, Mr. Cheney?  Iraq had NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.  Yet, the VP still insists it in his speeches and, according to an informal CNN online poll, 31% of Americans still believe it.  C’mon people, pay attention!  Bill Clinton’s autobiography is coming out soon and I cannot wait to purchase it and immerse myself in the happy Clinton years when there were no wars and the economy was strong.  Ah, how I miss the days when the biggest scandals focused on irrelevant land deals and Oval Office BJs.  So much for the Mets’ hitting streak.  Yesterday they went back to their old ways, only scoring one run.  Guess they better fire the new hitting coach!  Office lunch outing to Two Boots today.  I’m looking forwarding to ordering the Root Boot – it’s a root beer float with vanilla ice cream, served in a mug, shaped like a boot!  Mmm...

      It’s too damn hot out.  Yesterday we had the ribbon cutting for the new playground at Brower Park.  The event was a success but was it ever hot.  And today is no different.  At 7:30 this morning, it was already broiling.  Consider me cooked.  The Mets fired their hitting coach yesterday because none of their  players could remember how to hit.  (But when have the Mets ever hit?)  So in the very first game after the firing, the Mets win by scoring 7 runs on 14 hits.  I guess it really WAS the hitting coach’s fault after all!      It’s time for Summer Reality TV!  Yesterday was the premiere of “The Joe Schmoe Show 2” and tonight is the premiere of “The Simple Life 2.”  Is it mindless?  Yes.  Is it perfect for the summer when mindless rules the day?  Absolutely.  I’ve made plans to see “Fahrenheit 911” next Friday night, the first day it opens.  That's Michael Moore's new doc and I’m excited to see it.  They had the big celebrity screening a few days ago.  Although most of the crowd was liberal, Bill O’Reilly also showed up.  He left halfway through, which means that it HAS to be good!

      Haven't been able to think of a single thing to say today.  Happy Flag Day?  Nah, that's lame.  Although the cartoon guy in my "weather pixie" has been replaced by an American flag which for some reason I find to be funny.  Oh that reminds me of something.  Speaking of flags, the Supreme Court ruled today that "Under God" should remain in the pledge of allegiance.  Not because of any logic pertaining to the issues at hand.  But because they ruled that the plaintiff was not the proper legal guardian of the girl he was suing on behalf of.  Three cheers for technicalities!

It's an ideal place for a party - great drinks, great food, fun interactive jukebox, pool table & dart board, not too loud or crowded, and a cute bartender / waitress too!    Thanks to Jess for e-mailing me more Reunion pics!  They have been posted below.

      So I watched the tape of Reagan's funeral.  Pretty powerful.  My heart goes out to Nancy.  She's been a rock of strength this past week.  Although the eulogies by the politicians at the Washington Cathedral were well done (particularly the love shown by George Bush Sr.), I was most impressed by the speeches of Reagan's three children at the burial site.  I was most struck by Ron's comment, "My father was a religious man but, unlike many of our politicians, he never wore his religion on his sleeve.  He viewed his convictions as a responsibility but not as a mandate.  And believe me, there is a difference."  Wow, that statement seemed to be a subtle jab at Bush.  Between Ron's statement and Nancy's push for stem cell research, would it be too hopeful to wish for the Reagan family to join the Kerry campaign?  I'm sure it won't happen but the signs are there that they are not in lock-step with the current Republican administration.  And right now, the heart of the nation is with Nancy Reagan.  It has been a busy week at the Parks.  On Wednesday, we held an event at Taaffe Playground in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Children from the public school across the street, spent the year collecting $1000 in pennies in their Penny Harvest Drive.  The kids then decided that they wanted to use the money to fix up our playground.  So at the event, the Principal presented the Borough Commissioner with a ceremonial check for $1000.  It was a very sweet gesture.  Then on Thursday, another check presentation ceremony was held at Grand Ferry Park in Williamsburg.  This time, we received a check in the amount of $300,000 from the New York Power Authority to fix the park up.  Next on the schedule is a ribbon cutting this Tuesday at Brower Park in Crown Heights.  On the sidebar of this webpage, I have added a feature with links to other friend's webpages.  Basically, there are two ways that you can get your page listed there.  You can either link my page to yours or, failing that, you can leave a comment about one of my posts.  It's all about reciprocity!

      In honor of Ronald Reagan’s funeral, today is a national day of mourning.  Federal offices are...closed.  State offices are...closed.  City offices are...open.  Sigh.  So while Mayor Bloomberg goes to Washington to attend the funeral, the rest of us remain behind to do the work of the city.  No worries, I have my VCR set to tape the show.  (Was I just insensitive to have called the funeral a “show”?  Yeah, probably.  But there’s so much pomp and ceremony, it’s hard not to be wowed by it all.)  On top of that, Ray Charles died yesterday.  My favorite Ray Charles song has got to be “Night Time is the Right Time.”  It was performed on “The Cosby Show” by the Huxtable family as they lip-synched it to Cliff’s parents on their anniversary.  The best part is when Rudy belted “BAAABBBYYY!!!!!”  I can watch that one in reruns over and over again and never fail to crack up.

      Happy Brooklyn Day!  When I was a kid, I used to get this day off from school.  Although I’m still in Brooklyn, I don’t get it off anymore.  Rats.  I saw “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.”  It was my favorite of all the books and, thus far, it is my favorite movie.  I enjoyed Alfonso Cuaron’s direction.  Rather than show us every single scene from the book (ala the first two films), he just focused on the main themes and showed what was needed to move the story along.  What’s impressive is that even though the book was longer than the first two, its film version was shorter than each of the first two.  Besides, my alltime favorite scene in all of the Harry Potter books is the confrontation inside the tree between Sirius Black, Lupin, Pettigrew, Snape, and the kids.  It was as much fun to watch as it was to read.  Now, with “Goblet of Fire” schedule to open in November 2005, the films are catching up to the books.  I hope J.K. Rowling can write the last two quickly!

It put me on a serious nostalgia kick that has continued all week, what with keeping in touch with old friends, swapping pics, reading the books I bought about VC, etc.  But life goes on and so must this blog.  So starting tomorrow I will resume posting film reviews, political rants, news from the parks, and lots more!  Now if you'll excuse me, I must go back to my book about Vassar's transformation to coeducation...

      Vassar Reunion Recap for Saturday, June 5 and Sunday, June 6  My first night sleeping in a dorm room bed in 5 years netted four and a half hours sleep.  Not having an alarm clock, I left the shades open to ensure that the sunlight would wake me up.  I awoke at 8:00 A.M. and then took my first shower in a dorm room bathroom in 5 years.  Jay Briar complained that my blog posting about Friday didn’t have any details on the bathrooms so I’ll make up for it here by saying it had very good water pressure.  By 9:00, I was ready to go.  Ben was also up so we went to the college store.  On the way, we met some elderly alums and talked about the Japanese elm trees in the quad.  Even though the store had only been open for 15 minutes, it was already very crowded.  I made three purchases.  A Vassar Alumni sweatshirt.  A book about the history and architecture of Vassar’s buildings.  And a book about how Vassar spurned Yale’s offer to merge and became a co-ed school in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Those two books will certainly keep me busy for a while.  As I was waiting on line, I stood next to a woman who said that she flew in all the way from Saudi Arabia to attend reunion.  That’s amazing.  I left the store and ran into Jon Gans and Emily Jacobs in the retreat.  I wasn’t sure if they would be coming so I was very happy to see them.  (I am going to be in their wedding party next year)  Pictures were taken with them as well as with ADK and Stu in the retreat.  I saw Marguerite Mugge too.  (Not Marguerite Moreau though.  She was supposed to attend but couldn’t at the last minute)  Then it was back to Davison to drop off my new purchases and to get ready for the Alumni Parade!  All the classes lined up for the parade on the path in between the Chapel and Main.  Each class was adorned with banners and balloons in our class colors.  Lots of pictures were taken and I had the honor of holding the Class of 1999 banner, along with Becky.  The parade started with Fran, her dog, a band and then a golf cart driving the lone member of the Class of 1929.  Think about that... 1929.  If she was 20 when she graduated then that would make her 95 today.  Amazing.  More golf carts followed with members of the Class of 1934 and 1939.  Then other classes followed, marching behind.  Standing on the sidelines, all of us cheered for them and they in turn cheered for us.  Many of them looked at us and said “You’re so young!” or “Look, there’s men!”  Don’t forget, Vassar was originally an all-womens college so it was great to see all of the alumni from that era.  The Classes of 1948 and 1949 marched together because the classes were very small, as World War II prevented many women from leaving home.  One of the alums that I spoke with earlier in the quad went over to me and we gave each other a high five.  Then we saw the Class of 1974 with a banner proclaiming that they are Vassar’s first fully co-ed class.  As we cheered for all of the classes ahead of us, it became our turn to march.  But since we were the tail end of the parade, there was no one left to cheer for us!  Thankfully, Graham Campbell and Pedro Amador broke away from the group and ran along the sidelines yelling “Yay! 99!”  The parade made its way to the new athletic building next to Walker.  Inside there is a new gymnasium that was set up for a rally.  Our class was assigned the side bleachers.  Two huge video screens were set up next to a stage.  What followed was a presentation announcing how much each class gave to the college.  The Class of 99 gave the most money for a 5-Year Class in 28 years, as our gift was around $17,000.  Thanks to Annie Thottam and Carolyn Brooks for their hard fundraising efforts.  The 50th Reunion Year class gave over $2 million!  And the total for all classes was over $9 million.  Amazing.  After those announcements we were shown a very sentimental video combining footage from Vassar at the turn of the century, with that of the 1950s, and with that of the present day.  Everyone got a little emotional during it; a testimony to how well the institution is loved by its alumni.  Many people, myself included, said during the weekend that we would love to drop everything and do another 4 years all over again.  Finally, the rally concluded with a singing of “Gaudeamus”, the traditional scholar’s song.  After that event they were giving out box lunches, but I wasn’t interested so I went back to the Retreat and consumed a roast beef sandwich, just like they used to make it.  Then it started to drizzle and, since there was some downtime, I decided to check out some of the new renovations.  I went into Noyes, my home for three years, to see the renovated Jetson Lounge.  I also checked out all of my old rooms to complete the nostalgia trip.  Then I went into Jewett, which was completely gutted and beautifully redone.  It doesn’t even resemble a dorm anymore; it’s like a hotel.  Melissa Walker said that her old room is now a stairwell.  Andrij Dobriansky said that his old room is now a study hall.  The halls, walls, windows, furniture are all impeccable and if I lived there I’d be afraid to touch anything!  I wonder if this is their idea in renovating all of the dorms.  After my self-guided tour I went back to Davison to catch up on some rest.  I tried to nap for a half-hour but who can nap during reunion?  So I chilled on the front steps of Davison, talking to Matt Newton, and waving to all of the late arrivals including Jill Cadre.  Ben soon came by and to end our boredom, along came a golf cart being driven by a reunion staffer.  She asked if anyone needed a ride so Ben and I said “Sure!”  She told us that she had 20 minutes left in her shift and would drive us around campus for that long.  Turns out that our host was Emma Angevine’s younger sister from the Class of 04!  So we sped through campus and checked out the new South Commons facilities.  Along the way, we saw older alums slowly making their way around campus.  When we asked them if we could take them anywhere, most declined.  I think they wanted to prove to themselves that they could still walk around campus, unassisted.  Finally some alums did want a ride to the new Center for Drama and Film so Ben and I were kicked out of the cart.  While that was happening, my favorite political science professor, Richard Born, was giving a lecture.  I did not attend but Jon Gans e-mailed me to fill me in on what happened.  Jon wrote, “So Born's talk was pretty good and wicked funny.  The same old antics, clothes, and notes.  He was more enthusiastic than I remember... He was like :  ‘I wanted to call this talk Delay does Dallas (pause) and Houston and Fort Worth..., but I didn't think they would print it in the program.’  He told Mike Riggs and I to forget all the nonsense he said in class about ticket-splitting, the decline of political parties, etc.  He said he was wrong.”  So basically, my political mentor just openly admitted that everything he taught us was wrong!  Can’t beat that one.  After that class, Austin Brown invited Mr. Born to attend the Class of 99 cocktail reception in Raymond.  Born’s response was “Well, I don’t know if I’m really supposed to go.”  Austin convinced him though!  More on that later.  Anyway, after Ben and I were kicked off the golf cart, I made my way back to my room to change for the President’s reception for donor societies.  I was invited since my gift contribution just barely qualified me as a Cornaro Fellow.  So I put on some nicer clothes and made my way over to Fran’s house.  She had a big tent set up on her lawn and the first person I recognized was Ken Wong, from the Class of 2000.  Ken said that even though it wasn’t his reunion he decided to come up to campus for Fran’s donor reception.  ADK and Stu then made a beeline in my direction as there weren’t too many 99ers there so we have to stick together.  A gin and tonic and a red wine were consumed.  We waited on a receiving line to pay our respects to Fran and I had a nice little conversation with her.  She said how much she appreciated the large turnout of our class.  (Almost half attended)  I mentioned how well organized the parade and rally was and how nice it is for the different generations to have the opportunity to interact.  Fran then encouraged us to go inside of her house and look around.  So we did, admiring her artwork and books.  In one room we saw her TV and personal video collection.  Amusingly, Adam Sandler’s “The Wedding Singer” was included.  I then went back into the reception and met up with Jill and Annie Thottam.  We hung out for a little while and then made our way over to Main.  Each parlor on the second floor of Main was being occupied by various small receptions.  I peeked into the Faculty Parlor and saw some people I recognized so I went inside and started saying hello to people.  I then asked one person what this reception was for and he said that it was the Gay and Lesbian Alumni Association.  To which I said, “Cool!  I’ll see you later then!”  Heh heh, can’t have any rumors going around now!  Jill, Annie and I then visited the reception for the Latino/Latina Alumni Association.  We caught the very end of some speeches and then partook in some festive fruit.  At that point I made my way up to the 3rd Floor of Main to see the room that I lived in during my senior year.  I also checked my e-mail at the computer cluster and that was when I found out that Ronald Reagan had passed away.  It would become a big dinnertime conversation topic that night.  Back to Davison to watch the Belmont Stakes.  The room was packed with members of our class and the Class of ’89.  I still can’t believe that Smarty Jones lost.  He had it!  During the race I chatted with former Davison residents, Megan Marks and Adam Perrelli.  Megan was quite devastated when Smarty lost.  Many were.  Then it was over to Raymond for the Class of ’99 reception.  All I can say about that one is – nothing says Vassar better than red wine in a paper cup.  The room was packed and it was a bit difficult to move around.  I did see Mr. Born though as he accepted Austin’s invitation and attended.  We had a nice conversation as he remembered where I was working and whom I used to work for.  Austin then invited him to go golfing with us at the 10-Year Reunion.  After that it was on to the Saturday night dinner.  Each class had a tent set up outside of the dorms.  Ours was on the lawn in between Chicago Hall and Joss.  This was a sit-down dinner and they checked for tickets this time.  (Good thing too since we spent $35 on em)  The dinner consisted of a choice of chicken, tuna or pasta, with potatoes & veggies, a salad, cheesecake, and yes – red or white wine.  So that marked my third red wine in three consecutive receptions.  Reunion Chair Michelle Laredo got on the microphone and got cheers when she said “Don’t worry.  I won’t be asking you for any money.”  Becky Corona then got on the mic and acknowledged the efforts of her fellow class officers - Marivel (applause), Jill (applause), and me (the room ERUPTED in applause).  I don’t mean to sound cocky – on the contrary I was very humbled by it.  I couldn’t get over the overwhelming reception I got from my classmates and I’m very thankful for it.  Becky then said that we are accepting names for new officers and anyone who is interested should contact her.  I suppose we’ll have an election via the mail or something.  As for me though, I am officially retired!  After dinner, there was yet another fireworks display.  This one emanated from off-campus.  Coincidentally there was a street fair going on in Poughkeepsie.  After lingering in the tent for a while, a bunch of us made our way back to the Davison MPR to relax.  Gabe, Jonty and I ordered chicken parms from Naps, thus fulfilling my eating goals for the weekend.  We also watched the end of the NHL game and the news coverage about Reagan.  The night died down after that.  Some people went back to the Acrop (I couldn’t even look at food anymore) so I visited the Mug for literally five minutes before getting sick of it.  So it was back to the dorm to hang out until 2:30 A.M. at which time I called it a night.  Slept for seven and half hours uninterrupted.  Woke up at 10 and at 11 made my way over to ACDC for the brunch.  It was so surreal to be walking to ACDC again with a group of people.  Serious deja vu.  The selection of brunch foods wasn’t as impressive.  Stephanie went into the main dining area to get some cereal and an employee bitched her out because it wasn’t “part of the brunch.”  Stephanie said, “I paid $15 and you won’t let me eat CEREAL?”  The worker conceded but that was just ridiculous.  Anyway the brunch was a somber affair as everyone was saying goodbye to each other.  Before I left though, I checked out the new second floor of ACDC which is now the new Students Center.  Very nicely designed.  The weekend then ended as Ben drove Jess and me back to the train station.  Jess and I finished our trip the way we started – on the Metro North.    All in all, a great weekend.  Thanks for reading this very long recap!

      And now, a recap of my 5-Year Vassar Reunion!  Due to its length, this first post will focus on Friday, June 4 with other posts coming soon.  It started on Friday when I met up with Jess Roth in Grand Central Station.  While waiting for our train we consumed soup in the food court (matzo ball for me) and we saw our first Vassar people, Kate Lane and Jerry Decker – both of whom were also eating!  We took the 3:12 train to Poughkeepsie and arrived a little bit after 5:00.  Upon leaving the Po-town train station, we were greeted by the standard posse of Jamaican cabbies who yell “Vassar?  Vassar?”  One very aggressive cabbie got nine of us, including me, Jess, Jerry, Kate, Dave Giles and Tom Pyun, to cram into his van.  I barely even fit as instead of sitting I was kneeling in between the seat and the door for the entire ride.  But that’s all part of the Poughkeepsie Cab experience.    We were dropped off near North Lot and our group proceeded to wheel our respective luggage toward the registration in the Aula.  On the way there I saw a new fountain and garden and said out loud, “Yo, what the hell is this new thing?”  Then when I looked closer and saw the plaque inscription “Dedicated to the victims of September 11, 2001”, I felt very foolish and said, “Oh.”  Once arriving at the Aula, I registered and got my welcoming packet including keys to Davison 327.  Several items were for sale including one clever t-shirt that said “Vassar Football.  Undefeated since 1861.”  I didn’t buy it though.  I called Ben Horst on my cell phone and he informed me that he was hanging out in the College Center Circle so I said “See ya later” to Jess and the others and met up with Ben.  We then went over to Davison so I could drop my bag off in the room.  On the way we saw “Easy E” Erich Walter, Pedro Amador and some others kicking around a soccer ball in the quad.  Everyone was already feeling very relaxed and comfortable!  On to Davison it was and I was quite impressed with the size of 327.  I learned later on that it’s one of the prime singles in the dorm and is usually taken by a House Officer.  I don’t know who put the housing assignments together but they obviously know that I rate!  Even better was that Ben was right across the hall from me.    We then went down to the Davison multi-purpose room where a welcoming reception was being held for our class.  We were given t-shirts, steins, and beer.  There would be plenty of more beer to be had over the weekend.  And wine.  And mixed drinks.  It’s pretty obvious that they were trying to get us all drunk – possibly so we’d give them more money!  Among the people I talked with at the reception were Michelle Laredo-Torres, her husband Efrain, Becky Corona, Marivel Oropeza, Nikki Ruth, Allison Harris, Colleen Fox, Annabelle the desk messenger and our friendly student assistant.  That’s also when Gabe and Jen Anderson made their arrival!  There were many many other people I talked with there too but I can’t be expected to remember them all.  By now it was approaching 7:00 and it was time to head off to the Friday Dinner at the Walker Field House Tents.  I walked to Walker with Ben, Gabe, Jen, Shrey, Jonty Yamisha and Jonty’s wife Dina and 5-month old daughter Maydene.  The baby is so cute and so well behaved!  They took her to many of the events and she was always smiling and having a good time.  Anyway once at Walker, we sat at various round tables.  Ben and I joined Brandee and Rouslan at a table.  I also spent some time sitting with Jess, Erin Condy and Carrie Schultz at another table. And with Tara Knowland and Noel Baxter (too bad that Noel's husband, Joe Bonk, couldn't make it - he was my student fellow!) Table hopping is ultimately called for in such occasions.  I also had an animated conversation with Cody Kushner about baseball!  It was a great buffet dinner including unlimited drinks and unlimited Vassar Devils.  Those are the great desserts consisting of chocolate cake underneath vanilla ice cream, hot chocolate syrup and many toppings.  The only problem was that we spent 20 bucks on our tickets and noone even bothered to check them!  Easy E didn’t come to the dinner because he didn’t have a ticket.  When I told him that they didn’t even check, his response was, “What a gyp!”  (FYI – they made a point to definitely check tickets at the Saturday dinner)  After the dinner there was a cool fireworks display and we then made our way to the College Center.  In the College Center, Sally-Anne Moringello reserved room 237 for a smaller reunion for members of the Miscelleny News Ed Board.  I was never on Ed Board so I crashed!  Our group was then joined by Stephen Gribbin, ADK, Stu, Stephanie Litos, Melissa Walker and Tye Wolfe.  What great fun we had looking at current Misc issues and picking out all the typos and horridly written articles.  They even spelled the word “Students” wrong in one of their big-fonted headlines.  Sigh...  Apparently the Misc people used to take lots of votes in their meetings and Litos was saying that we needed to vote on something.  So we all voted that Melissa would be one of the new class notes correspondents, as the terms of me and Litos are now over and done with.  We also drank beer and consumed cookies with vanilla frosting that were generously provided by S-A.  Stu made a point to remind me to eat lots of cookies.    While in the College Center, I checked my e-mail on one of the many iMacs they have on the second floor and was pleasantly surprised to see that someone made VassarChat.com the default web setting. Between that and all of the VassarChat flyers that were circulated, the whole campus is bound to know about us soon!  From there it was on to the Mug!  Let me tell you something.  It hasn’t changed.  It’s dark, loud, crowded and the floors are as sticky as ever.  The sight of a bunch of alums sitting on the Mug Line was hilarious.  Although the DJ played some newer songs like “Hey Ya!” and my personal favorite, “I’m a Hustler”, we also heard many of the same stuff that was played from 1995-1999.  With all the noise it’s also the perfect place to have a conversation : “How’s it going?”  “What?”  “How are you?” “WHAT?”  Despite not being able to hear very much I think I had some conversations with Austin Brown, Hayden Courtland, Graham Campbell, Amar Reganti, Nicole Zahka and others.  I had thought it would be all 99ers in the Mug but there were many from 94, 89, 84, there was even one guy from the Class of 74 with a big white bushy beard and he made a real beeline to the bar!  Great to see all of the diversity.  It’s now 1:30 A.M. and hunger is setting in.  I had two eating goals for Reunion weekend.  One was to go to the Acropolis Diner.  The second was to order a chicken parm from Naps.  The first was done on this night as Ben, Gabe, Jen and I set off for the Acrop.  We walked there and I didn’t remember it being such a big walk!  Old age setting in.  Sitting right across from us were Erin, Matt Wilson and Matt’s fiancée Stephanie.  So yeah, I table hopped again.  Since it was technically morning, I decided to have breakfast – a scrambled egg with bacon!  The best part was when our waitress mocked the owner (her boss) right in front of him.  I wonder if she still had a job the next day.    After eating off the alcohol that was consumed, it was back to Davison.  It’s now 2:30 A.M.  By that time most of the people I knew had gone to sleep.  I walked around for a while looking for some action and sure enough I found it in the shape of a loud party on the 4th Floor of Davison.  But I didn’t stay too long and retired to my room and to bed at 3:30 A.M.  After all, there would be a very big day tomorrow!  Stay tuned for the recap of what happened on Saturday, June 5.

      Guess where I'm typing this right now?  At an iMac in the Vassar College Center!  Reunion is so amazing.  The past two days have been incredible and I am going to write all about it on this blog very soon.  But first some thoughts on non-reunion related matters.  Ronald Reagan passed away this morning.  After ten years of being ravaged by Altzheimers, I'm glad that he is no longer suffering.  Although I am no fan of his presidency or his policies, his passing is nonetheless a sad moment for America and I extend my sympathies to Nancy.  Speaking of Nancy, I have to give her all the credit in the world for voicing her support of stem-cell research.  The Bush Administration's opposition to it makes no sense - yet another case where policy has been hijacked by religious ideology.  But Nancy realizes that the research opens a world of opportunities - who knows, maybe it can cure Altzheimers.  Hopefully in the coming media frenzy over Reagan's death and funeral, Nancy will stress the importance of this matter.  Yet again, a horse wins the Kentucky Derby, wins the Preakness, but chokes in the Belmont Stakes.  This time the choker was Smarty Jones.  The worst part was Smarty had the race won!  A four-leg lead that all of a sudden vanishes from a horse that came from nowhere to surpass it.  And the hopes of all horse racing fans are dashed...again.  Don't worry, a full detailed reunion recap is coming to this blog very soon!  Stay tuned.

      I can’t get over how perfect the weather is (as everyone can see from my Weather Pixie!)  I could be outdoors all day long with weather like this.  As it was, I had a convenient excuse to be in Central Park this morning and was sure to take some time to appreciate its beauty.  And I can I tell you how mobbed the zoo was with classes on field trips?  It was pretty mobbed.  George Tenet resigned today as Director of the C.I.A.  The reasoning behind it?  According to Tenet, “It was a personal decision, and had only one basis in fact: the well being of my wonderful family, nothing more and nothing less."  Riiiggghhhttt...  Anytime an elected official or a highly appointed official resigns for “family reasons”, it’s all a load of crap.  It’s a code for being shown the door.  For Tenet, the intelligence failures related to 9-11, WMD and many others, have finally caught up with him.  Now can Rumsfeld resign next?  Who says that spelling bees are not a dangerous sport?  Earlier today, a 13-year old boy appeared to faint and collapsed on stage, drawing gasps from the audience.  After a few seconds, he gathered himself, stood up and immediately started spelling “alopecoid.”  He got it right and then received immediate medical attention.  This might be the last blog update for a few days.  I’m off to Poughkeepsie tomorrow and most likely will not have access to a computer.  Even if I did, I don’t think blogging would be on my mind!  But I will return next week with a full recap on what happened at the Vassar Reunion!

      Saw “Fiddler on the Roof” last night at the Minskoff Theater.  Very good show in a comfortable theater.  Rarely do I see a show on Broadway that I am SO familiar with, inside and out.  I was literally mouthing the words to myself as they sang them.  Alfred Molina played Tevye and, although he was good, I don’t think he measured up to Topol’s performance in the movie.  It seemed that Molina was trying his best not to mimic Topol and to make the character his own, but I kept thinking after each number that Topol did a better job.  Oh well, he spoiled me.  The actor who played the tailor Motel Kamzoil was fantastic though with impeccable comic timing.  He was appropriately nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Tony.  The dream sequence was very well staged with lots of cool special effects including actors descending from the rafters.  The actresses who played Tevye’s daughters all did a good job.  I never fail to tear up during “Far From the Home I Love.”  And there was a new musical number in the second act that was not included in the original production or the movie.  It is called “Topsy Turvy” and has Yente and a couple of the other women lamenting the changes.  The final change came at the end of the show.  Instead of the fiddler being the last one to walk off the stage, he passed the fiddle off to a young boy and they walked off together, symbolizing that as they move to a new world, the traditions are being passed on to the next generation.  Got an e-mail from AAVC last night saying that more members of the Class of 99 have registered for reunion than any other 5-Year class in their history!  Should be an amazing turnout.  However, due to those numbers, our class will be housed in Davison and not Main as originally planned.  I am very familiar with Davison though as I spent a lot of time there during my freshman year.  Only two days to go!

      Is it June already?  Dang, 2004 is flying by.  It’s a three-day work week, thanks to the holiday yesterday and my going away on Friday.  I love short weeks.  I’m thinking of various different ways to improve this website.  In addition to the picture on the right, you can now see a Weather Pixie, detailing the latest weather conditions at JFK International Airport.  If anyone knows of any other fun do-hickeys that I can add to this site, please let me know!  Sometime today I have to write my final Class Notes column for the Vassar Quarterly.  I inherited the job a few years ago from a former correspondent who reads this blog (long story!)  It’s been a fun job with minimal work – only about an hour, twice a year – but even still, I’m happy to be done with it.  The novelty of writing the column wears off after a couple of years.  I hereby pass the torch to whoever else wants to do it.   Tonight I am seeing “Fiddler on the Roof.”  Although I have seen the show many, many, many times, this is the first version that I’m seeing on Broadway.  Thanks to Jessica for providing free tickets!  A review will be forthcoming tomorrow.

      I saw They Might Be Giants perform a free concert last night at Prospect Park.  It was so much fun.  It was also a big Blogger party as I was joined by  urlLink Sarah ,  urlLink Caren ,  urlLink The Anonymous Blogger 's substitute,  urlLink Claire ,  urlLink Daryl  and  urlLink Sydney .  Those who joined us that didn't have blogs were Anonymous's friend "Daisy", Daryl's friend Annie, and my friend & co-worker Eryn, with her friend Cary.  A great time was had as TMBG is always entertaining.  Most of their best songs and biggest crowd reactions came from the "Flood" CD, which reminded me of the Simpsons episode where Homer attends a BTO concert and screams "Play 'Taking Care of Business'!  Nothing from your new album.  No new crap!  Just 'Taking Care of Business'.  And skip to the chorus!"  Some pics from last night are posted below...

      What a convention.&nbsp; Four nights of rousing and inspired speeches.&nbsp; Over the weekend I will chime in with my thoughts on the week but for now...  A recap of Thursday night’s speeches at the Democratic National Convention    John Kerry   “My name is John Kerry and I am reporting for duty... “We have it in our power to change the world again. But only if we're true to our ideals – and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight. As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House... “Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities – and I do – because some issues just aren't all that simple. Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn’t make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so. As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence. I will immediately reform the intelligence system – so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics. And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to...&nbsp;  “And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace. I know what we have to do in Iraq. We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers. That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home... “I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President. Let there be no mistake: I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security. And I will build a stronger American military...  “And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country. Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives. Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism... That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people... “For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans. Values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families. You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break. We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play. And that is the choice in this election. You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall. We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: "Honor thy father and thy mother." As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine. And that is the choice in this election. You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more. We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family. And that is the choice in this election... “And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes. I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education... “The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress. Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C. And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected – it is a right for all Americans... “I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence. I want you to know more about them. So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech: go to johnkerry.com... “I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States... “And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side... “And now it's our time to ask: What if? What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDS? What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?... “I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California. No one cared where we went to school. No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other – and we still do. That is the kind of America I will lead as President – an America where we are all in the same boat.”     Max Cleland   “I ultimately realized that although I had lost a lot, I still had a lot left, and I resolved to make something of my life. I decided to run for the State Senate in Georgia. I won, but when I got there, in 1971, I was a lone voice. Then I heard this young veteran on TV speaking about the war. It was John Kerry. He put everything I was feeling into words. Tonight, I’d like to let you know, that even before I met John Kerry, he was my brother. Even before I knew John Kerry, he was my friend. Even before I spoke with John Kerry, he gave me hope...  “As I look back over the last 36 years, I now realize John Kerry’s service to his country didn’t end in Vietnam. It began there. Since Vietnam, John Kerry’s life has become an object lesson in what was once described as the true definition of patriotism “the long and steady dedication of a lifetime.”... “My fellow Americans John Kerry has never let me down. He’ll never let you down. He is an authentic American hero. He is the next captain of our ship of state. And he will be the next president of the United States.”     Wesley Clark   “War. I've been there. Heard the thump of enemy mortars. Seen the tracers fly. Bled on the battlefield. Recovered in hospitals. Received and obeyed orders. Sent men and women into battle. Awarded medals, comforted families, attended funerals. And this soldier has news for you: Anyone who tells you that one political party has a monopoly on the best defense of our nation is committing a fraud on the American people. Franklin Roosevelt said it best: "Repetition does not transform a lie into a truth."...  “This hall and this party are filled with veterans who have served under this flag - our flag. We rose and stood reveille to this flag. We saluted this flag. We fought for this flag. And we've seen brave men and women buried under this flag. This flag is ours! And nobody will take it away from us... “Under John Kerry we will attack and destroy the terrorist threat to America. He'll join the pantheon of great wartime Democrats. Great Democrats like Woodrow Wilson, who led us to victory in World War I. Great Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, who turned back the tide of fascism to win World War II. Great Democrats like John Kennedy, who stood firm and steered us safely through the Cuban Missile Crisis. And great Democrats like Bill Clinton, who confronted ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia, and with diplomacy - backed by force - brought peace to a shattered land. My fellow Americans, Democrats are leaders. Democrats are fighters. John Kerry is a leader and fighter and he will be a great Commander-in-Chief.”&nbsp;

      A recap of Wednesday night's speeches at the Democratic National Convention    John Edwards   “Decisive. Strong. Aren’t these the traits you want in a Commander in Chief? We hear a lot of talk about values. Where I come from, you don’t judge someone’s values based on how they use that word in a political ad. You judge their values based upon what they’ve spent their life doing. So when a man volunteers to serve his country, and puts his life on the line for others, &shy;that’s a man who represents real American values. This is a man who is prepared to keep the American people safe and to make America stronger at home and respected in the world... “The truth is, we still live in two different Americas: one for people who have lived the American Dream and don’t have to worry, and another for most Americans who work hard and still struggle to make ends meet. It doesn’t have to be that way. We can build one America...  “I have heard some discussions and debates about where, and in front of what audiences we should talk about race, equality, and civil rights. Well, I have an answer to that question. Everywhere. Everywhere.&nbsp; Everywhere. This is not an African-American issue, not a Latino issue, not an Asian-American issue, this is an American issue. It’s about who we are, what our values are, what kind of country we want to live in...  “And we will have one clear unmistakable message for al Qaida and the rest of these terrorists. You cannot run. You cannot hide. And we will destroy you...  “So when you return home, you might pass a mother on her way to work the late-shift &shy;you tell her……hope is on the way. When your brother calls and says that he’s working all the time at the office and still can’t get ahead&shy; - you tell him……hope is on the way. When your parents call and tell you their medical bills are through the roof - you tell them…...hope is on the way. When your neighbor calls you and says that her daughter has worked hard and wants to go to college - &shy;you tell her……hope is on the way. When you talk to your son or daughter who is serving this country and protecting our freedoms in Iraq&shy; - you tell them……hope is on the way. And when you wake up and sit with your kids at the kitchen table, talking to them about the great possibilities in America, you make sure that they know that John and I believe at our core that tomorrow can be better than today”    Elizabeth Edwards   “This has been quite a year for John and for me. We started last January crisscrossing America, talking about how, with determination and vision and optimism, we can end the injustice of two Americas. And this January, it's going to end when we move two great friends, two great Americans, John Kerry and Teresa Heinz Kerry, into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue...  “You know, I married the smartest, toughest, sweetest man I know. And in two days, we will celebrate 27 years of marriage the way we always do. We'll do it the way we always do at Wendy's. Whether it's Wendy's or Washington, I've found that it's true: It's not where you go, it's who you go with... “But none of the things I've mentioned are the reason that I married John Edwards. I married him because he was the single-most optimistic person that I have ever known. He knew there was a brighter day ahead, even as he swept the floors in the cotton mill as a high school student. He knew if he worked hard enough, he could be the first in his family to go to college. He knew that he could outwork and out-tough any battalion of lawyers to find justice. And he continued that fight in Washington, courageously, eloquently, with one simple goal: to make the opportunities of America available to all Americans”    Al Sharpton   “I'm convinced that at a time when a vicious spirit in the body politic of this country that attempts to undermine America's freedoms -- our civil rights, and civil liberties -- we must leave this city and go forth and organize this nation for victory for our party and John Kerry and John Edwards in November... “Mr. President, I heard you say Friday that you had questions for voters, particularly African- American voters. And you asked the question: Did the Democratic Party take us for granted? ...Let me answer your question. You said the Republican Party was the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. It is true that Mr. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, after which there was a commitment to give 40 acres and a mule. That's where the argument, to this day, of reparations starts. We never got the 40 acres. We went all the way to Herbert Hoover, and we never got the 40 acres. We didn't get the mule. So we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us... “Mr. President, the reason we are fighting so hard, the reason we took Florida so seriously, is our right to vote wasn't gained because of our age. Our vote was soaked in the blood of martyrs, soaked in the blood of good men, soaked in the blood of four little girls in Birmingham. This vote is sacred to us. This vote can't be bargained away. This vote can't be given away. Mr. President, in all due respect, Mr. President, read my lips: Our vote is not for sale... “And it occurred to me as I heard Ray Charles singing, that Ray wasn't singing about what he knew, because Ray had been blind since he was a child. He hadn't seen many purple mountains. He hadn't seen many fruited plains. He was singing about what he believed to be. Mr. President, we love America, not because all of us have seen the beauty all the time. But we believed if we kept on working, if we kept on marching, if we kept on voting, if we kept on believing, we would make America beautiful for everybody. Starting in November, let's make America beautiful again.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      A recap of Tuesday night's speeches at the Democratic National Convention     Teresa Heinz Kerry    “My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry. And by now I hope it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have something to say...  “I know how precious freedom is. It is a sacred gift, sanctified by those who have lived it and those who have died defending it. My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called “opinionated,” is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish. My only hope is that, one day soon, women &shy;who have all earned the right to their opinions&shy;, instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are...  “John is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country. No one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will &shy;and he will always be first in the line of fire...  “The Americans John and I have met in the course of this campaign all want America to provide hopeful leadership again. They want America to return to its moral bearings. It is not a moralistic America they seek, but a moral nation that understands and willingly shoulders its obligations; a moral nation that rejects thoughtless and greedy choices in favor of thoughtful and generous actions; a moral nation that leads through the power of its ideas and the power of its example. We can and we should join together to make the most of this great gift we have been given, this gift of freedom, this gift of America.”     Ron Reagan    “A few of you may be surprised to see someone with my last name showing up to speak at a Democratic convention. Let me assure you, I am not here to make a political speech, and the topic at hand should not, must not, have anything to do with partisanship...  “I am here tonight to talk about the issue of research into what may be the greatest medical breakthrough in our or in any lifetime: the use of embryonic stem cells — cells created using the material of our own bodies — to cure a wide range of fatal and debilitating illnesses...  “Now, there are those who would stand in the way of this remarkable future, who would deny the federal funding so crucial to basic research... A few of these folks, needless to say, are just grinding a political axe and they should he ashamed of themselves. But many are well-meaning and sincere. Their belief is just that, an article of faith, and they are entitled to it. But it does not follow that the theology of a few should be allowed to forestall the health and well-being of the many. And how can we affirm life if we abandon those whose own lives are so desperately at risk?...  “What excuse will we offer this young woman (13-year old diabetes sufferer) should we fail her now? What might we tell her children? Or the millions of others who suffer? That when given an opportunity to help, we turned away? That facing political opposition, we lost our nerve? That even though we knew better, we did nothing?...  “Whatever else you do come November 2nd, I urge you, please, cast a vote for embryonic stem cell research.”     Barack Obama    “My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or “blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential... I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage...knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible...  “Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn – they know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white...  “For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we are connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for her prescription, and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother. If there's an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It's that fundamental belief – I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper – that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. E pluribus unum...  “Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America – there's the United States of America. There's not a Black America and White America and Latino America and Asian America– there's the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.”     Howard Dean    “I was hoping for a reception like this. I was just hoping that it would be on Thursday night, instead of on Tuesday night...  “I may not be the nominee, but I can tell you this: For the next hundred days, I’ll be doing everything I can to make sure that John Kerry and John Edwards take our country back for the people who built it. Because tonight, we’re all here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic party...  “We’re not going to be afraid to stand up for what we believe. We’re not going to let those who disagree with us shout us down under a banner of false patriotism. And we’re not going to give up a single voter, or a single state...  “To everyone who supported me you’ve given me so much, and I can’t thank you enough. But this was never about me. It was about us. It was about giving new life to our party, new energy to our democracy, and providing hope again for the greatest nation on earth.”

      A recap of Monday night’s speeches at the Democratic National Convention     Bill Clinton    “Now this state, who gave us in other times of challenge John Adams and John Kennedy, has given us John Kerry, a good man, a great senator, a visionary leader... “We Democrats want to build a world and an America of shared responsibilities and shared benefits. We want a world with more global cooperation where we act alone only when we absolutely have to. We think the role of government should be to give people the tools to create the conditions to make the most of their own lives. And we think everybody should have that chance... “On the other hand, the Republicans in Washington believe that America should be run by the right people — their people — in a world in which America acts unilaterally when we can and cooperates when we have to. They believe the role of government is to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of those who embrace their economic, political and social views, leaving ordinary citizens to fend for themselves on important matters like health care and retirement security. Now, since most Americans aren't that far to the right, our friends have to portray us Democrats as simply unacceptable, lacking in strength and values. In other words, they need a divided America. But we don't. Americans long to be united... “For the first time when America was in a war footing in our whole history, they gave two huge tax cuts, nearly half of which went to the top 1 percent of us. Now, I'm in that group for the first time in my life. And you might remember that when I was in office, on occasion, the Republicans were kind of mean to me. But as soon as I got out and made money, I became part of the most important group in the world to them. It was amazing. I never thought I'd be so well cared for by the president and the Republicans in Congress. I almost sent them a thank you note for my tax cuts until I realized that the rest of you were paying the bill for it. And then I thought better of it... “Now, we tried it their way for 12 years. We tried it our way for eight years. Then we tried it their way for four more. But the only test that matters is whether people were better off when we finished than when we started. Our way works better... “During the Vietnam War, many young men, including the current president, the vice president and me, could have gone to Vietnam and didn't. John Kerry came from a privileged background. He could have avoided going too, but instead, he said: Send me... “Now, everybody talks about John Edwards' energy and intellect and charisma. You know, I kind of resent him... “Their opponents will tell you we should be afraid of John Kerry and John Edwards, because they won't stand up to the terrorists. Don't you believe it. Strength and wisdom are not opposing values...  “Now, again, it is time to choose. Since we're all in the same boat, we should choose a captain of our ship who is a brave good man, who knows how to steer a vessel through troubled waters, to the calm seas and the clear sides of our more perfect union. That is our mission. So let us go in tonight and say to America in a loud, clear voice: Send John Kerry.”     Hillary Rodham Clinton    “We meet at a moment of great peril, but also of great hope... “(John Kerry) will lead the world, not alienate it. Lower the deficit, not raise it. Create good jobs, not lose them. Solve a health care crisis, not ignore it. I know a thing or two about health care. And the problems have only gotten worse in the past four years... “Being a Senator from New York, I saw first-hand the devastation of 9/11..I hope no American ever has to witness a sight like that again. That tragedy changed all of us. I know it changed me. And every day now, as a mother, as a Senator, and as an American I worry about whether we are acting as wisely as we can to protect our country and our people. Last week, the bipartisan 9/11 commission issued its report. It was a sober call to action that we ignore at our peril. John Kerry understands what’s at stake... “John Kerry is a serious man, for a serious job. So let’s work our hearts out and send him to the White House in 2004. And I’m optimistic we will because I know a great leader when I see one.”    Jimmy Carter   “Twenty-eight years ago, I was running for president, and I said then I want a government as good and as honest and as decent and as competent and as compassionate as are the American people. I say this again tonight, and that's exactly what we will have next January with John Kerry as president of the United States of America... “Today our Democratic Party is led by another former naval officer, one who volunteered for military service. He showed up when assigned to duty and he served with honor and distinction. He also knows the horrors of war and the responsibilities of leadership. And I am confident that next January he would restore the judgment and maturity to our government that nowadays is sorely lacking... “After 9/11, America stood proud, wounded but determined and united. A cowardly attack on innocent civilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding around the world. But in just 34 months we have watched with deep concern as all this good will has been squandered by a virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations.... “You can't be a war president one day and claim to be a peace president the next depending on the latest political polls. When our national security requires military action, John Kerry has already proven, in Vietnam, that he will not hesitate to act. And as a proven defender of our national security, John Kerry will strengthen the global alliance against terrorism while avoiding unnecessary wars.”     Al Gore   “I’m going to be candid with you. I had hoped to be back here this week under different circumstances, running for re-election. But you know the old saying: you win some, you lose some. And then there’s that little-known third category... “Take it from me, every vote counts. In our democracy, every vote has power. And never forget that power is yours. Don’t let anyone take it away from you or talk you into throwing it away... “I sincerely ask those watching at home tonight who supported President Bush four years ago: did you really get what you expected from the candidate you voted for? Is our country more united today? Or more divided? Has the promise of compassionate conservatism been fulfilled? Or do those words now ring hollow? For that matter, are the economic policies really conservative at all? For example, did you expect the largest deficits in history, year after year? One right after another? And the loss of more than a million jobs? By the way, I know about the bad economy. I was the first one laid off...  “I also ask tonight for the consideration and the help of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000. I urge you to ask yourselves this question: Do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?... “We have to be crystal clear about the threat we face from terrorism. It is deadly. It is real. It is imminent. But in order to protect our people, shouldn’t we focus on the real source of this threat: the group that attacked us and is trying to attack us again: Al Qaeda, headed by Osama bin Laden? Wouldn’t we be safer with a president who didn’t insist on confusing Al Qaeda with Iraq?”  &nbsp;

      If you look at  urlLink my Friendster profile , you will see that one of my favorite hobbies is "Brainstorming Ideas for Novels I Never Have Time to Write." This is also true for screenplays. Sometimes I’m not sure if a particular idea would work better as a novel or as a screenplay but when I visualize ideas they often play in my mind like a film. Anyway I wrote a couple of screenplays in 1998 but currently hate everything about them. I know I can do better and over the weekend I started to jot down some notes on a new idea. It’s original in the sense that this particular story has never been done before, yet if I were to give you the pitch, you’d say, "Oh, it’s just like ..." That’s because in my brainstorming process I have a tendency to focus on a well-respected film - take its basic themes and structure – but then completely change the situations, settings and characters. So instead of being about "X", it’s about "Y". Anyway we’ll see how this one develops.  Since our office air conditioning was busted, we were given this giant industrial fan to use until the A.C. can be fixed. The fan is positioned right next to my desk and the best part is that it’s whirring drowns out most other sounds. Phone rings? Sorry, can’t hear it. Someone’s trying to get my attention? Sorry, can’t hear you. Someone complimented me on my haircut this morning and thought I was dissing them by not responding. But I wasn’t being rude, I didn’t know that she said anything! It’s a very Larry David / "Curb Your Enthusiasm" situation.  I was asked this morning who will profit from the proceeds of the 9/11 Commission report, currently available in a bookstore near you.&nbsp; My theory is that Tom Keane, Lee Hamilton and the rest of the commission is going to use the proceeds to take a nice relaxing vacation in Tahiti.  On the speaking schedule for the Democratic Convention tonight : Al Gore, Jimmy Carter, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton. In other words, it’s nostalgia night. (Or in Hillary’s case, the future?)

      Mini film reviews...  I saw "Bad Santa."&nbsp; My opinion of that movie can be found in its title.&nbsp; And my opinion ain't "Santa."  Saw the first 20 minutes of "Malibu's Most Wanted" on HBO.&nbsp; Would have watched more but my attention span was too short.&nbsp; Did like the bit where the rabbi asks the kid "What theme do you want for your Bar Mitzvah?&nbsp; Star Wars?&nbsp; Baseball?&nbsp; Superheroes?"&nbsp; And the kid replies "An O.P.P. theme!"&nbsp; Cut to the bar mitzvah where the 13-year old is grinding with some hootchies to the tune "I got an O.P.P., Yeah you know me!", as the horrified guests look on.  And speaking of strange bar mitzvahs, the Daily News ran a story yesterday on people who give bar mitzvahs for their dogs.&nbsp; They dress their dogs up in mini-yarmulkahs and mini-tallises.&nbsp; I know it's a sign of affection for their pets but I still think these people have too much time on their hands.  Attended&nbsp;a doubleheader yesterday for the Brooklyn Cyclones.&nbsp; They lost the first game.&nbsp; Then they were losing the second game and we decided to leave early.&nbsp; Shortly after leaving, the Cyclone came back and won the second game.&nbsp; So typical!  And yes, as I'm sure everyone is wondering, my barber got back from his vacation and I finally got that haircut yesterday.&nbsp; Now I'm shorn for the summer.  Had some strange dreams over the weekend.&nbsp; On Friday I dreamt I was a member of the press and was flown to Baghdad to cover the next court appearance of Saddam Hussein.&nbsp; Then last night I had a dream that Manhattan became engrossed in riots similar to those in "Gangs of New York" and everyone fled to Brooklyn.  Democratic Convention starts tomorrow.&nbsp; Yay!

      "Phil’s Spin Zone" returns to more serious political commentaries...  After months of research, interviews, and stiff resistance from the Bush administration, the 9/11 Commission released their final report yesterday. They concluded, "This was a failure of policy, management, capability and above all a failure of imagination." Rather than going after individuals, many government agencies were blamed including both the Clinton and Bush administrations. The commission issued many recommendations that they believe will improve our intelligence capabilities and I believe those recommendations should be taken seriously and implemented as soon as possible. Unfortunately, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said that there wouldn’t be time to consider the changes until next year. How is it possible that in the face of all these color coded threat warnings, that Hastert and others can be so indifferent to our shortcomings? That he dismisses the commission’s recommendations as "another layer of bureaucracy" ignores the fact that this was a bipartisan commission that explored every angle of the 9-11 tragedy to the fullest extent. They are legitimate and they deserve the trust and respect of the U.S. Congress.  Today is the 1-Year anniversary of James Davis’ assassination. Davis was a Brooklyn City Council Member who was murdered last year inside of City Hall by a deranged member of his entourage. I admired Davis and was fortunate to have met him on three occassions. The first time was shortly after his election to the City Council. I was eating lunch in a Fort Greene diner when he came in to shake hands and introduce himself. The second time was at a Parks ribbon cutting event where I took pictures of him going down the slides. The last time I saw him was at Mayor Bloomberg’s State of the City address at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. His assassination last year was shocking and has led to enhanced security measures inside of City Hall.

      This is my 200th blog posting.&nbsp; Hoo-ray!!!  David Wright’s Met debut... 0 for 4. But he was defensively sound and the Mets won the game. Of course, they only won because the Expo first baseman dropped a routine throw, but we’ll take whatever wins we can get.   Convention mania is heating up. The Democrats hit Boston next week and "Phil’s Spin Zone" will provide a complete recap of what happens inside the Fleet Center. Then the Republicans come to NYC in late August, at which point I will avoid Manhattan like the plague.   Last night I got my butt kicked in a hardcore game of Scrabble. It had been many years since I played and my opponent showed no mercy. All the high-point letters were used against me... Zs, Qs, but sadly no Os. Revenge will be mine though. Oh yes, revenge will be mine.

      There’s this great cartoon circulating the internet spoofing Bush and Kerry. It’s quite bipartisan as each candidate -- thanks to animated photos and voice impersonations -- trades character assassination accusations to the melody of "This Land is Your Land."  urlLink View it here! &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just as soon as the Mets start winning, the Mets start losing. It’s going to be one of those years. They lost their second game in a row to Florida last night, putting them back under .500. But they’re only three games out of first place in the crowded and mediocre NL East. Tonight they call David Wright up from the minor leagues? Will he meet the expectations or will he be yet another of their over-hyped prospects? Stay tuned.   For those wondering how I’m doing in Fantasy Baseball (and I’m sure you’re ALL wondering), my team "Thugz Inc." is in 7th place in a 12-team league. But I’m within striking distance of 6th!  &nbsp;  urlLink Check out this link from the NY Daily News about the park event that I talked about yesterday.

      We renamed a park today in the Cypress Hills / East New York section of Brooklyn.&nbsp; Formerly Verona Playground, it will now be known as George Walker Jr. Park.&nbsp; Walker was a community activist who fought against the proliferation of drugs on his block.&nbsp; He helped the City seal off a condemned building that became a drug haven.&nbsp; Once the building was knocked down, it was converted into the playground that now bears his name.&nbsp; It was a nice event, with Walker's family in attendance.&nbsp; My favorite part came after it was over though.&nbsp; It was another hot sunny day so we turned on the spray shower and I ran through it, clothing and all!&nbsp; I spent the rest of the day soaking wet but it was worth it.   In honor of George Walker Jr., I believe the following quote from Ali G. is appropriate... "Drugs.&nbsp; It's not something&nbsp;you should do.&nbsp; It's something you should don't."

      Today is the last day at work for one of my co-workers, Paul Thomsen. He is off to Kansas where he will be pursuing his Ph.D. in military history. Paul is also a historical writer and he has a novel coming out in September. It’s called "Rebel Chief : The Motley Life of William Holland Thomas" and it’s about a white man in the 19th century who became the chief of an Indian tribe. I am plugging his book especially because Paul was good enough to list me in his acknowledgments. So,  urlLink preorder it here!

Richard: Well, I think most conduct most of us engage in on a day-to-day basis is legal.  Ali: So, what is illegal?  Richard: What is illegal is what the elected representatives of the people define as crimes.  Ali: What is barely legal?  Richard: Well, that's where you get into technicalities and you have trials.  Ali: 'Cause me saw dis film called Barely Legal Three and it was about these two naughty college girls and them have done their own work and then as punishment they had to have a three-header with their supervisor, this teacher. Is that to do with the law?  Richard: Uh, it's hard to say. That's probably governed by the rules of the institution, the college.

      The first order of business is to clarify something that I wrote in "1995". I mentioned that I helped to write the musical, Sing. This is true but "help" is a vague word. I was part of the committee that came up with the concepts, themes and settings of the show. The bulk of the writing was done by Danielle Weinstein and Rachel Levine and they deserve credit for it. Happy, Danielle? :)   And now the conclusion of my own "I Love the 90s"...    1998    1998 was the year of the Syndicate. What's that you say? The Syndicate was formed by me, Dave and Ben who had just returned from Beijing. This triumverate evolved into an oranized crime group, thugging and pimping our way across campus. But while all that fun was going on, there was some seriousness too as my father had a serious quadruple heart bypass operation near the beginning of the year. Fortunately all went well with it. I also made my film debut, performing in Dave's student film "Time." I had the lead role, of a college student diagnosed with leukemia. Dave got an A and my performance was acknowledged as a big part of it. I then made my electoral comback getting elected Secretary of the Class of '99. So what if I was running unopposed? Everyone else feared going up against me! In May I said goodbye to many of my Class of 98 friends who were graduating such as Bartow and Briar. Jon and I would have to carry the nVo mantle ourselves. The summer of 98 was relaxing. I spent some of it working on Weiner's congressional campaign. I also worked on two screenplays and visited Vassar in July where both Ben and Dave were staying there for the summer. In the fall, I headed back for my senior year. Ben, Dave and I were unable to get a TH or TA in the room draw so we settled for a suite in Main that was promptly renamed TH D-Funkt. We spent the year feuding with our neighbors, The Turkish Harem. One time those girls snuck into our living room and created a maze of yarn in it, ala "The Parent Trap". I also got to know my fellow class officers, Becky, Marivel and Jill. Together, we decided that our old class account e-mail password would be '3L1J', representing our ethnicities... three Latinas and one Jew. We interviewed for our class council and appointed a wide variety of personalities including Homeskool!&nbsp; We planned the campus-wide Halloween party and it was awesome.&nbsp; I dressed as Sting, the former WCW wrestler.&nbsp; Also that year I took a swing dancing class with Kristin. And more intramural softball. 1998 was fun.&nbsp;    1999      "And tonight we're gonna party like it's 1999." And I did. With most of my serious academic work out of the way, my final semester at Vassar did resemble a big party. The year began with a cocktail / housewarming party in my suite. Which was followed by many parties in the THs. And weeknights at the Mug (where I found out they served free sodas!) Then I served on the committee to find a commencement speaker and we wound up getting James Earl Jones. Awesome choice. I also had a political career to finish and I did that by serving as Chair of the Board of Elections. Jon was my assistant chair and we had a great time. I only had to disqualify one candidate and he brought me before the school's judicial board because of it! (P.S. I won the case.) Another of my jobs was picking who would do the annual commencement musical. After one Sarah Ackerman told me that she didn't have time to do it, I wound up with two proposals - "Pippin" and "The Fantasticks". I picked "Pippin" as I thought the themes were more fitting for a commencement. Then it was senior week with the booze cruise, the winery brunch, the Star Wars Episode 1 premiere, the lazer tag and other events I can't remember. Before I knew it graduation weekend arrived and so did the family. Saturday was a fantastic day culminating in the bonfire where I burned the books I hated most. But on Sunday it rained, putting a slight damper on the actual graduation ceremony. Then it was back to Brooklyn and the very next day I interviewed with the Parks Department. Got hired two days later. Started two weeks later. And a new era began. Blah blah blah. Work work work. The decade ended amid Y2K anxieties and a New Years Party at Jill's place.   Hope everyone enjoyed my look back at the 90s!

      VH-1's "I Love the 90s" has been pretty good but there have been some glaring omissions, including stuff that they advertised would be included.  So far they've covered 1990-1995 and there's been no Seinfeld, no Friends, no ER, no Beavis and Butthead, no My So Called Life and no Simpsons.  Maybe they couldn't get the rights to show the clips?  Maybe they're already planning for "I Love the 90s Strikes Back"?  It's odd.  To the anonymous person leaving comments - identify yourself!  E-mail me if you'd prefer.  And now the series continues...   1996   1996 began with an awesome New Years Eve with high school friends while seeing a They Might be Giants concert in NYC.  Then it was back to campus during a snowstorm.  And for months it snowed and snowed.  Very depressing.  I didn't see grass until April.  I went home for spring break and spent it shoveling snow.  But in late March I was elected president of my dorm!  In a three way race, I got 53% of the vote.  My two opponents lived on the same floor so they split the votes of that floor while I carried the other three floors.  Now that's strategy!  Best part of being elected president was picking the best room in the dorm for myself for sophomore year.  I picked a big double, right by the center stairwell and with windows overlooking Noyes Circle and opening onto the mushroom. I think I declared political science as my major sometime around then.   Upon returning to campus for soph year, I was busy giving orientations to the new freshmen, enforcing (and choosing when not to enforce) house rules, and planning social events.  Like jello wrestling!  Yes, that was our big party.  Outdoor jello wrestling.  Besides the cold, I remember participating in a house president battle royale.  Also in 1996, the nVo was formed.  That's the New Vassar Order consisting of me, Jon, Bartow and Briar.  We sat together in Mr. Born's class on the American Presidency, had lunch afterwards and soon started attending pro wrestling events!  The history of the nVo, featuring all of our exploits, can be found on the  urlLink nVo history page.    1997   1997 began with another New Years party with high school friends but as our lives were diverging on different paths, it would be the last time I would see several of them.  Back to Vassar to finish my term as Noyes President.  My next step was running for Vice President of the VSA.  But I lost to Tara, a friend and a house officer who had worked for me.  So that sucked.  I rebounded by getting elected Treasurer of the Jewish Union but that was just a consolation prize.  Most fun of 1997?  The Mens Seder.  In 1996, the Mens Seder consisted of me, Bartow, Moshe and Getnick, taking over the Jew House, downing bottles of Manischvitz, eating a full tray of chicken each, watching porn and making crank calls to our friends.  Getnick had so much fun that he flunked his finals and had to drop out of Vassar.  In 1997, the Mens Seder was expanded to 15 people.  No porn or phone calls but plenty of Manischevitz.  Our party then proceeded to the Mug wearing red Turkish fezzes.  In the summer I worked for Councilman Weiner and then returned to Vassar for junior year.  Many of my good friends were JYA - Jessica in London, Ben in Beijing - so I became closer with Dave, the nVo guys, and a bunch of underclassman who lived on my floor.  Although I originally had a small single, I got to move into another huge double for myself when someone moved out.  It was also during this semester that I made my debut playing and managing an intramural softball team.  Our team name?  Nobi's Horde of Doom.    Oh and to those of you who wanted juicy gossip, sorry.  Too many people I know read this thing.  Stay tuned tomorrow for the conclusion of this series - 1998 and 1999!

      More from my own "I Love the 90s"...   1994   1994.  The year of college applications.  The process of looking at schools, visiting them, applying to them and interviewing for them seemed like it completely consumed me for the entire year.  And that includes taking the SAT and doing all the prep work for it including Saturday sessions of The Princeton Review.  The first college that I visited actually took place in late 1993 - SUNY Binghamton.  The rest of my visits took place in the summer of '94 and they included Princeton, Brown, Amherst, Vassar, Haverford, UPenn, Cornell and Wesleyan.  I wound up applying to all of the above except for Haverford and UPenn.  Princeton was my first choice and I applied Early Action but was deferred into the regular pool of applicants.  Of the other choices, I was most impressed with Vassar.  Elsewhere in 1994, I rejoined the legitimate student government by winning an election for Vice President.  This was also the year I felt the most comfortable in my social skin, spending time with a great group of friends including Joslyn, Lisa, Dan K, Dan H, Adam, Lauren, Jessica, Melissa and others establishing ourselves as the "second floor" crowd.   And I should also mention visiting the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. right when it first opened.     1995   What a year this was.  The end of high school.  The summer transition.  The start of college.  The year started with some sad news as my Grandma Rose passed away, my last remaining grandparent.  Then with college applications in the mail, I was able to relax and participate in Sing! (an original musical production).  I helped write the script and had several roles in the show including Elvis!  Then I was casted in another musical, "The Roar of the Greasepaint, The Smell of the Crowd."  In the spring I was disappointed to get a rejection letter from Princeton but happy to get an acceptance letter from Vassar.  It was clear that I much preferred Vassar to the rest of the schools that accepted me so (once the financial aid details were worked out) I made the decision to move to Poughkeepsie!  The rest of senior year included a weekend trip to Quebec City, a prom on the Spirit of NY cruise ship, and a graduation at Madison Square Garden where I again got to speak!  The summer was spent working for Anthony Weiner again and preparing for the big move.  Many weekends were spent with the parents at stores like Bed Bath & Beyond and Linens and Things.  Then in late August it was off to Vassar!  I was glad to have Jess with me from H.S. to help smooth the transition.  Once there I quickly made friends with my own hallmates in Noyes House and with Jess's hallmates in Davison House.  In October, Hillary Clinton came to campus to speak at freshman parents weekend.  I also had one roommate, Otis, drop out after only six weeks and another roommate, Jon, replace him.  Oh, and Jon brought his loud bird with him.  It was an exciting semester!  Stay tuned tomorrow for 1996 and 1997 - juicy Vassar gossip!

      My personal version of “I Love the 90s” continues...   1992   The year started with my seeing the movie “JFK” and becoming utterly convinced that Kennedy was killed in a coup de tat orchestrated by Lyndon Johnson.  I even read a poem that I wrote about it aloud to my English class.  And for this high school freshman, thus began my political career.  It was followed by my election to the position of “Sophomore Senator” for the next year.  I beat an Asian kid who could barely speak English by a very significant margin!  I also entered the working world, doing a summer internship for Chuck Schumer.  But the best political news for me was seeing Bill Clinton get elected President.  To see a Democrat win the White House for the first time in my life was euphoric.  And speaking of euphoria, I fell absolutely head over heels for this girl who sat next to me in English class, named Joslyn.  I would carry a serious thing for her throughout my four years in high school.  Quite an interesting history there.  Elsewhere in 1992, I went on my last family vacation to California.  This time we visited San Diego as well as L.A.   1993   After interning for Chuck Schumer in 1992, and being one out of a gazillion interns in the office, I decided to go somewhere where I could be of more use.  So in the summer of ’93 I began working for then-Councilman (now Congressman) Anthony Weiner.  Having just been elected to the City Council, I was Weiner’s very first intern and would continue to go back for many exciting summers to come.  Back at school, I decided to prematurely run for President of the Student Alliance.  It was an ambitious and, in hindsight, stupid move to run against an upperclassman and I got my ass handed to me.  Bitter till the end, I decided to become a little revolutionary.  Since student government has no power anyway, I banded all of the other election losers together and we formed our own little counter-government, challenging the real one’s legitimacy at every turn.  Such fun!  Since I had some free time I decided to enter the world of drama.  I auditioned for my school’s production of “Brighton Beach Memoirs” and came in second for the lead role of Eugene Jerome.  Although disappointed, I went on to audition for the next musical “Hello, Dolly!” and this time was casted.  I played a dancing waiter, the court clerk and several other ensemble roles.  Clearly I was casted for acting skills though, and not because of singing or dancing!  But most importantly in 1993, the Abramson family finally got cable TV.  Stay tuned tomorrow for 1994 and, the most significant year of the decade for me, 1995.

      Every night this week from 9-11, VH-1 is showing “I Love the 90s”, a celebration of pop cultural events throughout the decade.  I completely enjoyed “I Love the 80s” as that decade comprised my childhood.  My brother even taped the show onto DVDs and I’ve watched it over and over for the past year and a half.  VH-1’s “I Love the 70s” program didn’t thrill me as much since I was barely alive in that decade and don’t remember much from the 2 years and three months that I did see of the 70s.  But the 90s was quite the decade for me as it covered junior high, high school, college and the working world.  I can’t wait to see how VH-1 depicts it.  Tonight they will be covering 1990 and 1991, tomorrow will be 1992 and 1993, and so on.  So what I thought I’d do with this blog is to take two years per day and summarize what happened in MY life during those years.  My own personalized version of “I Love the 90s.”       1990   1990 can be summarized by two words.  Bar Mitzvah.  Having never gone to Hebrew School, I was tutored at home every Monday night by Rabbi Eli Orgel.  He taught me how to read Hebrew and about Jewish culture.  It culminated in a perfect reading of my haftorah that completely impressed the synagogue’s resident rabbi, the congregation, and my family and friends.  To this day it might be one of the proudest moments of my life.  And the reception on the next day was so much fun, held in the same reception hall where my parents were married.  The weekend lived on throughout the decade through the wonders of Paris Video.  I also spent the year attending the bar mitzvahs of my friends – Joel, Andrew, Ryan, Howie, David, Eric, Eli, and I’m sure there were others.  1990 was also notable for the junior high school experience.  What an awkward, peer pressure environment that was.  Basically, if you didn’t wear Champion sweatshirts and Nike Air sneakers, then you just weren’t considered “cool.”  I spent much of the year struggling to conform so that I too could be part of the cool crowd.  My crushes that year included Jaime, Stacy and Debbie.  The end of the year class trip was to Boston.  And oh yeah, I wore my hair completely spiked.    1991   In 1991, I ditched the spiked hair and decided to comb it normally.  And in my last six months of junior high, I succeeded in becoming part of the cool crowd.  Naturally it would only last for a few months until graduation, officially ending the ridiculous junior high social structure.  That year I became very globally aware as the Persian Gulf War broke out.  Although Gulf War I ended in a month, it was the first war for my generation and we were worried that it would expand into something much worse.  We also went on a great class trip to Montreal and Quebec City.  But unfortunately, my Grandpa Murray died that year.   Our junior high graduation was held at Brooklyn College where I gave a speech, thus beginning my affinity for public speaking.  That summer was my last completely free summer of my childhood where I didn’t have to work.  The family vacationed to Los Angeles, visiting my aunt and uncle who lived there at the time.  In the fall, I began Murrow High School!  I remember being physically exhausted after the first day and asking “Do I have to go back tomorrow?”  But I loved Murrow and did indeed go back.

      This weekend I committed myself to cleaning my apartment.  So much useless junk has accumulated over the past few years and it must be purged!  Particularly since I am considering moving to another place one of these days and do not want to have to deal with all the junk at the last minute.  I have a fun idea for this blog.  Stay tuned tomorrow and throughout the week to see what it is.

      So it's been a sobering week.  The unexpected loss of a friend in the prime of her life caused reflection on appreciating each day and enjoying the small, seemingly insignificant moments that comprise "life."  All too often I find myself worrying about the future at the expense of appreciating the present.  Maybe this will help put things in better perspective.  Yesterday, we had a ribbon cutting for a new synthetic turf ballfield in Brooklyn.  (a picture is included above this post)  I was concerned about the prospect of a very hot day.  Thursday was brutal and the heat would have been magnified on the turf surface.  Fortunately, Friday cooled off a bit and it was a pleasurable day.  (Wendy, I guess you were right after all about the cool front - although it's hot again today!)  Saw some good movies this past week.  "In America" was a nice surprise, about an Irish family that moves to Hell's Kitchen NYC in the early 1980s, after the accidental death of their son.  The girls who played the 10 and 6 year old daughters were adorable.  Best line was when the 10 year old said to her father, "Don't call me 'little girl.'  I've been carrying this family on my back for the past year."  I also enjoyed "Cold Mountain" and "The Terminal".  Both were a little slow and dragged in their middles but the stories and fine acting made up for it.  I was going to get a haircut today but my barber of 15 years is on vacation and I won't let anyone else do my hair.  So it will have to wait until next Saturday.  Currently playing on my XM Satellite Radio - Milli Vanilli, "Blame it on the Rain"

      Hot.  So hot.  And the air conditioner at work is barely working.  Don’t... know... how... much... longer... I... can...  (collapses at desk from heatstroke)  A slight breeze awakens me as I grasp for the water bottle at the other end of the desk.  So close, yet so far.  Can't... quite... reach... ah, got it! Gulp... gulp... gulp.  Ah...   Still hot though.

      John Edwards has been selected by John Kerry as his Vice Presidential running mate.  Although the choice is not terribly surprising, it may have been the best choice that Kerry could have made.  Edwards gained prominence during the primary campaign and most Americans seem to have a positive opinion of him.  The worst that can be said about him is that he’s inexperienced.  Then again, so was George W. Bush.  Looking at Kerry and Edwards together, one is reminded of Abe Lincoln (Kerry) and John F. Kennedy (Edwards).  Or at least I’m reminded of them.    The New York Post has lots of egg on its face this morning.  Their headline read “Kerry’s Choice : Dem picks Gephardt as VP candidate”, with a big front page photo of Kerry and Gephardt together.  Dumbasses.  They credited an unnamed source who was either misinformed or had the Post completely played.  It wouldn’t surprise me if the Post was deliberately tipped off in the wrong direction just to make them look bad.  After all, they never resist an opportunity to bury the Democratic Party in their front page headlines.  Godspeed to Kerry and Edwards!

      It pains me to write that one of my classmates from Vassar, Erin Schlather, passed away over the weekend.  She was involved in a single car accident on Saturday morning in her hometown of Ithaca, NY.  I have some wonderful memories of her.  She was exceptionally kind, funloving, intelligent, and always had a smile on her face.  Whether it was hanging out in Noyes House, or taking Bob Brigham's seminar on the Vietnam War, I was lucky to have known her.   urlLink Click here for the obituary.

      HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY!!!  Actually, the entire notion that America was born on the 4th of July is a myth.  The Founding Fathers voted on adopting the Declaration of Independence on July 2.  In his letters, John Adams wrote that July 2 would be celebrated by future generations.  The Declaration wasn't signed on July 4 either.  That was a gradual process that occured over several months.  But don't let those facts get in the way of the celebrations!  The best part of the 4th of July has got to be the hot dog eating contest at Coney Island.  It's become so famous that this year, ESPN made a one-hour show out of it.  And for the fourth year in a row, Kobayashi from Japan, a man thinner than ME, won the thing.  He broke his own record by eating 53 and a half dogs in 12 minutes.  His prize?  A years supply of hot dogs.  The Mets swept the Yankees this weekend!  Friday nights game was an 11-2 blowout.  Yesterday they won 10-9 and today they won 6-5.  The best part of today's win was that it happened on George Steinbrenner's birthday.  Take that!  And finally, Roger Federer won the mens title at Wimbledon, defeating Andy Roddick in 4 sets.  Roddick was ahead when the rains came, forcing a delay.  When play resumed, Federer took over and established himself as the undisputed #1 player in the world.  I remain partial to Maria Sharapova though.  Doesn't the trophy that she's holding in the picture below look like a huge Passover Seder plate?

      Congratulations, Maria Sharapova!  The 17-year old triumphed at Wimbledon this morning, confounding my expectations by upsetting Serena Williams.  At a score of 6-1, 6-4, it wasn't even close.  Afterwards, she proved to have a highly engaging personality, delivering a heartfelt and humorous interview to the BBC reporter.  She even tried calling her mom on her cell phone in the middle of Centre Court but complained that she couldn't get a good signal.

      So last month I got this thing called “SiteMeter” put on my blog.  It’s fascinating.  It tells you how many hits this page gets a day, what time zones the hits come from, what the domain addresses are that access the page, and other fun stats.  For example, the most popular domains are AOL, IP addresses, Road Runner, “NFor”, Verizon and Optimum Online but there are some other unique ones that I noticed such as “harvard.edu”, “sanantonio.gov”, “sunoil.com” and “buckeye-express.com”  One never knows who is lurking in the heart of the internet!  There were two great womens semifinals at Wimbledon yesterday.  Maria Sharapova beat Lindsay Davenport in 3 sets.  For Sharapova, it is her first grand slam final and it already establishes her as a better player than fellow Russian hottie, Anna Kournikova.  Impressive as she is, she is likely to be overwhelmed in the final by Serena Williams who defeated Amelie Mauresmo in her semi.  When healthy, Serena is the best player on the womens tour and she should destroy Sharapova.  Doesn’t mean I won’t be rooting for an upset though!  On the mens side, the semifinals were delayed by rain and will be completed tomorrow.  However, its on track to be a Roger Federer / Andy Roddick final.  They are the top two ranked players in the world and it should be an amazing match.  I’m all set for Breakfast at Wimbledon!

      For the first time since last December, new photos were released of Saddam Hussein.  Finally, the networks have footage of Saddam other than those of his being inspected for lice!  Freshly cured of his lice infections, Saddam appeared this morning before an Iraqi court.  The big bushy beard is gone, replaced by a thin white beard.  Those present reported that he remained defiant, claiming that he was still President of Iraq and that the trial was nothing more than theater.  If it is indeed theater then I believe we can call this play “The Execution of the Dictator.”  If anyone can come up with some snappier titles, let me know!  Matt Drudge, from The Drudge Report, often takes small rumors and blows them up into major headlines on his website.  Therefore, take this news with a grain of salt, but he reported yesterday that a “high level source” believes that John Kerry is very seriously considering naming Hillary Clinton as his running mate.   urlLink The article can be read here.   I doubt this will happen, but if it does I say it would be very good news for Kerry.  Yes, Hillary is a polarizing figure but the Democratic base loves her.  In 2000, New Yorkers stood on lines that stretched outside of the polling site, around the block, just to vote for her.  With the country split 50/50, the election will be determined on turnout.  If Hillary gets Democrats into the polls in droves, it can only help Kerry.  Those who hate Hillary are probably likely to vote for Bush anyway.  Plus, naming Hillary would give Kerry’s campaign a lot more media attention that it otherwise would.  That being said, he’ll probably pick someone safer and someone who won’t eclipse him in popularity.  The names John Edwards, Richard Gephardt and Tom Vilsack are named as likely candidates.  Although each can help deliver crucial states to Kerry, none particularly thrill me.  An official announcement is expected on Tuesday.  One of my co-workers is visiting the new Museum of Sex in Manhattan this weekend.  She is excited about some Asian exhibit.  I told her to let me know if they had any “hands on” exhibits.

      The Blogger Party. Coming soon, to a condo or apartment near you. Check out the webpage and particularly the comments section of  urlLink The Anonymous Blogger  for details as they develop.  My team, "Fay Wray Dead – King Kong Arrested," came in 4th place last night at Trivia. Disappointing because we were tied for 1st at the intermission. But we were sunk at the final visual category where we had to identify obscure character actors. Perhaps if my teammates weren’t so busy passing junior high school notes! Val did a good job with hosting and she’ll be back again to co-host next week.  Poor Tom Glavine. Not only is he stuck on a losing baseball team that always fails to give him run support, but yesterday he was involved in a car accident that caused him to lose his two front teeth. He was riding in a cab and an SUV smashed into them. Fortunately noone was seriously hurt. Amusingly, the cabbie complained that while all the police and medics attended to the celebrity Glavine, noone went to check on him until afterwards.

      What is wrong with Jason Giambi? The Yankee first baseman came to spring training carrying far less weight and mass than usual. It was whispered that he was a user of performance enhancing drugs and his reduced size resulted from his no longer using them. Then he goes on the disabled list with an intestinal parasite. It was assumed that he ate something bad in Japan as teammate Kevin Brown also had a parasite. But then, after the antibiotics failed to help, he announced that he has a benign tumor but instead of operating on it, it would be treated with medications. His return to the team is questionable. Although Yankee brass are optimistic that Giambi will return by next month, his friend Eric Chavez said in an interview that after speaking with Giambi, he doubted he’d be back this year at all. So what exactly is wrong with him? When the Yankee G.M. was asked if he knew where the tumor was, he said that he did but that he would not disclose it to the public, in keeping with Giambi’s privacy rights. I completely respect their desire to keep Giambi’s ailment private but the mystery just raises some anxious questions. The Yankees didn’t hesitate to announce David Cone’s aneurysm, Joe Torre’s prostate cancer or Darryl Strawberry’s colon cancer. So, what is wrong with Jason Giambi?

      Blog reader  urlLink Tex  referred me to this website,  urlLink Election Projection . It analyzes polls from each individual state to determine who would win the Electoral College if the voting were held today. Basically, it all boils down to the swing states of Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Whoever wins the majority of those states wins the election.  Over the weekend, the City Council and its speaker released a report slamming the cleanliness of NYC’s beaches, particularly Coney Island. It’s ridiculous. I’m at Coney often and can attest as to how clean it’s kept. Parks crews thoroughly clean the beach each night between 9:30 P.M. and 6:00 A.M. During the day, there are thousands of trash cans on the beach. It reeks of political motives for the speaker of the City Council to release this unscientific and unfounded report. Oh yeah, he’s running against the mayor next year.

      I took a little break from blogging yesterday as it's hard to think of things to put on here everyday. Especially on Saturdays when I wake up from a long sleep with my mind operating in slow motion. But Sitemeter tells me that my blog viewership decreases drastically during the weekends so I suppose it's no big loss if I skip a day or two.  The weather has been great in NYC this weekend. Unseasonably cool for early August, which is just fine with me. So I went into Manhattan both yesterday and today just to relax and hang out. On the recommendation of Gabe, AKA Chris, and The Anonymous Blogger, I went to see "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle." Pretty funny stuff! Although it wasn't wall-to-wall laughs as my referrers claimed, it was still plenty of laughs to qualify as an enjoyable flick. (My personal favorite scene : The worker at the burger place that replaced White Castle screaming that he was going to burn the place down) I left the theater STARVING, and craving White Castle. But I didn't know of any that were around so I ate at Wendy's instead. I actually do know of a couple of White Castles in Brooklyn but they're in ghetto neighborhoods. So I'll stick to the microwaveable White Castle burgers that I can buy in the supermarket.  An excerpt of dialogue from tonight's episode of "Entourage"... "Hey Turtle, where'd you guys meet?" "Uh... JDate." "Isn't that for Jews?" "So?" "She's wearing a cross." "She's reform."

      "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." --- George W. Bush, August 5, 2004  I couldn’t make this stuff up if I tried.  My efforts to do more new things continue. Last night I went to a local Democratic club, to visit a friend from my internship days and to introduce myself to the local councilman. It was a cool place but not somewhere where I can see myself spending too many social hours. Basically, the politicians and judges hobnob with each other and the senior citizens stuff envelopes. I might have to look into some social events for  younger  Democrats.  I have a relaxing weekend coming up with nothing planned in particular. Perhaps I’ll see some movies (i.e. "White Castle") or visit some museums that I haven’t been to in a while. Visiting the Met last week has put me back on a museum kick.

      Two of my favorite topics in recent months have been politics and blogging.  Combining the two is this  hilarious  article that I just saw in "The Onion".  I've pasted it below for all to enjoy...   CIA ASKS BUSH TO DISCONTINUE BLOG     WASHINGTON, DC-In the interest of national security, President Bush has been asked to stop posting entries on his three-month-old personal web log, acting CIA director John E. McLaughlin said Monday.  According to McLaughlin, several recent entries on PrezGeorgeW. typepad.com have compromised military operations, while other posts may have seriously undercut the PR efforts of White House press secretary Scott McClellan.  A July 24 posting read, "Just got back from a lunch with Colin and Adil Moussa (one of Prince Saud al-Faisal's guys). Colin wants the Saudis to send some troops to Najaf-so some of the soldiers are Arab, I guess. This Moussa guy sure wears a lot of jewelry. A golden chain, a golden ring with his initials or something, and some other sparkling stuff-kinda effeminate. Anyway, best of luck in Iraq, Iyad."  McLaughlin, normally hesitant to express public disapproval of the president, said the blog was "ill-advised."  "I would hate for the president to inadvertently put American soldiers at risk," McLaughlin said. "We work hard to maintain the integrity of state secrets. When we see the president posting details of troop movements, international counter-terrorism negotiations, and even the nuclear launch codes, as he did on Monday, we have to step up and say something."  Bush said he could not understand McLaughlin's anger, characterizing his blog as a "personal thing written for friends and family or whoever" and therefore "none of the CIA's business." Nevertheless, U.S. Secret Service director W. Ralph Basham objected to the blog, as well.  "He is compromising his safety and the safety of those in my department," Basham said, citing a post from last Thursday in which Bush revealed that he "had to go to some secret meeting with Norquist at some Marriot [sic] over in Virginia." "Someone could uncover some serious state secrets, if they took the time to wade through all of those photos he posted after he got that digital camera in June."  On Saturday, Basham asked to pre-screen all blog activity before Bush posts it online. Bush rejected Basham's request and later that day wrote in his blog that "Some people who shall remain nameless apparently do not know there is such a thing as free speech in this country."  Members of Bush's re-election team have urged the president to exercise caution with his blog, perhaps because of posts like the one dated July 8, 2004: "Another long day of speeches and fundraisers. Met with all these phony media company execs. Had to promise them some bill next term and shake a lot of stupid hands, but they did bring in two or three million or so. Whatever. Karl keeps a list. I got big laughs during my speech, so I'm happy."  Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie said he spoke to Bush about the blog last month.  "After he mentioned our Monday message-of-the-day in a Saturday post, we've really been pushing him to not talk about campaign strategy," Gillespie said. "He's not that involved in the planning anyway, so it shouldn't be too much to ask."  "We're not trying to stifle the president's creativity," Gillespie added. "We think it's great he's taking an interest in writing."  Bush maintained that he's doing nothing wrong.  "I know so many people, but I'm way too busy to keep in touch with all of them," Bush said. "Whether I'm talking about our strategies in Gitmo or my dogs down in Crawford, the blog is an easy way to let everyone know what's been up with me. If I've just had a really good lunch at a new restaurant, or something funny happens in a briefing from the NSA, I want to let my friends and family know about it."  McLaughlin said it's likely that Bush will eventually agree to submit his blog for review by the Secret Service.  "Right now, the president insists it's his right to have it, as long as he doesn't work on it during White House work hours," McLaughlin said. "But I believe we'll be able to convince him, if we let him calm down. And even if we don't, frankly, I can't see the blog holding his interest for too long."

      My trivia record is 1-0 after a big win in my debut last night!  Thanks go out to my smart teammates Val, Anonymous, Claire, Eric, chemistry professor and Republican dude in a suit.  When it came to the team name I said that we should make a pun off of Paris Hilton's black eye and bruises.  Val then came up with "Paris is Bruising" and we won the best team name prize.  Then we won the trivia contest, despite my shih-tzu / lhasa apso mixup, which my team took great delight in berating me for.  I remind them that Claire and I gave us all of our points in the Liberal Arts College question!  A fun time was had and props go out to Sarah and Caren for co-hosting (even if Sarah didn't know that the 9/11 Commission Report was paperback)  I noticed a few cute girls at several of the tables so I just might have to go back!  Bob Murphy sadly passed away yesterday.  He was the radio voice of the Mets from 1962-2003.  He was a pleasure to listen to and will be missed.  Bob, here's to many "happy recaps!"

      Tonight Sarah and Caren will be hosting Tuesday Night Trivia at the Baggot Inn. I’ve been hearing about this event for months but have yet to go... until now! With these two co-hosting, it’s got to be fun. I just hope I’ll be able to harness all of the useless knowledge I’ve accumulated and answer some of their questions.  The rest of this blog posting will be me bitching about the utter downfall of the Mets. Fred Wilpon said that his goal for the team was "to play meaningful games in September." Well, the best they could do was play meaningful games in July. A winning record at the All-Star break, only two games out of first, has dissolved into a record of six games under .500 and nine whole games behind the first place Atlanta Braves. Sigh, why should this year be any different? The players may change but the results stay the same. In better news, my Fantasy team is making a comeback. I’ve moved up from 7th to 4th place. Even if I don’t win, I’m definitely in contention for the "Most Improved" prize.  I'm currently eating the best tasting onion roll I've ever had...

      I forgot to mention yesterday that upon leaving the theater where I saw "The Village," a Loews staffer was handing out free samples of Advil. To which I said to him, "Hey, the movie wasn’t THAT painful!" All around laughed at my ingenious one-liner.  With the Democratic Convention all said and done with, I thought I’d offer my list of the Top 10 Speeches. They are...   1. Barack Obama   2. John Kerry   3. Bill Clinton   4. John Edwards   5. Wesley Clark   6. Jimmy Carter   7. Al Sharpton   8. Ron Reagan   9. Max Cleland 10. Teresa Heinz Kerry  Another hot and humid day in NYC. The dog days of August have begun. Woof.

      The plan for today was to see "Much Ado About Nothing" performed in Central Park.  Unfortunately, by the time Jess and I got there, all of the tickets for this evening's performance were gone.  Sadness.  But Jess will go back later this week at an earlier hour and hopefully we'll see it before it closes!  Instead we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and we saw "The Village."  The film was certainly different.  And interesting.  I'm not so sure how good a film it was but it sure was... interesting.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend it.
