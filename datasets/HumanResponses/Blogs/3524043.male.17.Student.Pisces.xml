      So far the season has had a red carpet treatment. Yes it is correct that no person wearing the colours of Farrari ould have anything negetive to say about the season. It has all been red, infact not just red but Shumi red. Ofcourse barachello has been there in four of the six Farrari victories but the glory has always been for Shumacher. With 60 points out of the seaven races, he is sitting on a confortable first with on immediate peril from anyone. Farrari have had not less success in the constructors championship. Being the only team to have reached three figures, it seems thay are on their way to another constructors championship victory. 	 It is true that in Formula one fortunes can change very quickly and tables can turn in a few races. Yet i would like to see some team over throwing the red-team-rule. Indeed with a lead of about 40  points any constructor will require a number a reaces to pose a challenge and even that if Farrari stop competeing or does not finish any races for a while, or are below the eighth position, anyway.  This, howeven, at the moment, seems as impossible as Micheal Shumacher making a move to Minardi or even lesser soo. At the moment, underperformance in one race results in a strong comeback in the next race. The failiur of Micheal in Monaco and the subsequent win in European GP are proof enough.  Although no review of 2004 season can start without the metion of the red-dominance, one must move on. Indeed, there is more to formula one then red cars leading all others from the start to the chequred flag. Infact if one excludes Farrari, the season has been an interesting one. The drivers, people had grown accustomed to see in the podium have, it seems, steooed down to make way for the new rookies. One obvious exception of ofcourse Micheal Shumacher.  Mclearen Mercedez have taken a leaf or two out of the lower teams, such as Minardi and the Jordan, and have cultivated a great friendship with them as many of their starts are form among them. Mclearn can be fast but then they don't last for more then a few laps. Out of seven races they have not even been able to reach double figures as yet.  The hammer headed Williams have a better story to tell although but no means encouraging. The new car was supposed to be fast, with the best engine, and great aerodynamics. Yet they have fallen short of expectations. With both drivers leaving the team at the end of the season and the rivalry among them at its peak the team finds it difficult to concentrate on the work at hand.  Yet behind the red veil, not everything is bleak. The underperformance of Mercedez and BMW have been well counterbalanced by a great imporvement by some other teams. The team that deserves to be  mentioned is BAR Honda. Engaging Jenson Button and Takuma Sato have been the best choice for the team as they have changed the team into one of the top, and are sitting at the third in constructors championship, with Button having fine podeums under his belt and both  he and Sato close to a maiden win.  Toyata, only in their third season have also been able to improve greatly and move forward. the 3 year vetrans have produced a nicely balanced and stable car with a good engine, although a little short on horse power. With drivers like Panis and Da matta the future of the young team looks good.  One team whose performance has not changed from the last year is Renault. Being fourth last year they have moved forward to being second this season. With the same drivers lineup as 2003 i.e. the rookie Fernando Alonso and the time hardened Jarno Trulli, who won his forst GP this year in Monaco, a good, stable, and soft handling car and a powerful engine in the back they are also on their way to Glory.  The rest of the lineup offers no excitement as Minardi, Jordan and Jaguar continue lining at the back of the grid and Saubar little further ahead. But with 11 races still to go no pridiction can be made. Mercedez and BMW have yet to make a comeback that is inevitable, yet Farrari do not seem to be in any trouble in the near future.

      The space and the sky are, to me, very interesting. Many people see sky as a roof or something they don’t need to pay attention to. However to me it is a vast ground of inexhaustible knowledge and imagination. Unlike anything on earth, the space has no boundaries or obstacles. When I say that it has no obstacles I mean to say that there is not limit to the flight of imagination and fascination. One might say that imagination and fascination have no boundaries but I believe otherwise. On earth the imagination is limited, and fascination restricted. No sane person can believe aliens as living on the earth, or at least he will never be able to convince even his own mind to except the eccentric idea. However, in space there cannot be any limit, for all we know there might actually be aliens living on some planet.  The space also offers an inexhaustible knowledge for anyone who cares. Indeed the knowledge and information is too vast to be learnt in a single life times, or for that mater in a few life times. Someone once told me that the space was very unforgiving and the delay between action and result was too large. Indeed, a person starting a project in space today cannot hope for results within his lifetime, but even this fact holds a fascination for me. I can be sure that for once whatever I do I am not selfish as the only beneficiaries would be the future generations. Don’t get me wrong. I am not planning a career in space nor in any related fields yet I believe in what I have said just now.  To me the only fascination in space is related to the imagination and the visualization. I love to look into the night sky and keep looking for a long time. I can practically look into the sky for the whole night, without feeling any boredom. Even the smallest star holds a whole world, thousands of time larger then ours and with infinite possibilities. I can almost feel myself walking on that planet, feeling the soft sand on my bare feet, and smell the air (although there might not be any air fit for human consumption on the planet in reality).  When I look onto the sky I do not see individual stars but a system - an impeccable system. To me the fact that the system works without a problem and has been doing so for millions or years is not a miracle but actually a sign of a greater force. However, I do not intend this to be an article about religion so I will say no more if the signs I see. Indeed I am greatly intrigued by the separate stars, each with a different history and characteristics, but the perfectly working system is much more interesting.  The system, when one comes to think of it, has a cycle of millions of years. Some of the phenomenons are repeated after thousands of years but with impeccable accuracy. The system actually consists of many smaller systems, some like our solar system, but also some very different systems. Even the meteors and planetary movement in a system and they all work simultaneously and with a perfect timing to form the larger system. This as a whole is indeed worth a mention. The starts are placed according to a plan and each star plays an important role in the bigger picture.  Whatever other people might think, to me, as I said before, the sky and the space hold great fascination and intrigue. I might not have explained my feeling properly and the reader might find it difficult to understand what I say and see from my point of view. Yet the only defense I have is that the feeling is not easy to explain as no words can portray it completely.
