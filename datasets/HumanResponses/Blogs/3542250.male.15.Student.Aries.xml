       urlLink    Looking at the grey sky, I sighed. We were not that poor few months ago but now we ARE! I'd gone to order the AVW today (2:30-3:30), but then Mum told me, "You'll have to pay for your lunch tomorrow - YOUR MONEY." Shit. I got nothing...& still I have to pay the remaing 159 for that bus! Things just couldn't get worser... [  Sign...what is money?...People live, struggle, die for it......not even me, not even my family.  ]

      Well, I'd done several things today - participated in that competition; English drama & studied at school. The cup wasn't that bad, though we lost. ("The" \./) God! Thank you! I could see her on the bus(standing) this morning ♥! Why?...I just felt that she had changed...not much eyes contact...but anyway, God, I love you. I felt that Al's attitude towards me had changed 2, maybe...we are just "classmates" at all, not "friends"...sigh. God, I still wanna sit with him!!

      Sign...things just couldn't be worser today...I was forced to attend the so-called competition tomorrow. The second thing that made me so down is, I felt sure that Tan don't feel/have any impression on me. This year is definitely an unhappy year to me. :( (  God! Thanks! I could at least see her for 1 min.!  )

       urlLink     Well, It's one of the happiest time in my F.3 school life... Divine, Jonathan & Felix went with me. Okay...the best team ever. lol The weather wasn't fine as expected. We just got by then. We did have a wonderful time playing roaster coaster, the so-called "banana ship", and a lot I don't even know their names in English. We started out at 9am and went back at about 630pm. Indeed I was exhausted! It was such a great day for me! They enjoyed too, isn't that?
