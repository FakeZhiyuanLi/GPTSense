       Eddie McGuire: Collingwood President, Columnist in the Herald Sun, Footy Show host, Channel 9 Football Comentator & Who Wants To Be A Millionaire host. Anyone would die to have a job like that. Maybe not Collingwood President, but Eddie McGuire has enough on his plate.  I remember when he hosted the Formula 1 telecast from Albert Park. That was unbearable. He's also hosted the logies. That was unbearable aswell. The point I'm trying to make is:  Eddie, Shut up!  I know there's people who reckon that Eddie's doing everything for the good of the game, but WRONG!!!! Eddie is a wannabe-bigshot who has nothing to do but unleash verbal diahorreia on the public.  Thank god there's a website to help the public of Australia that hate Eddie's guts:   http://www.petitiononline.com/shutuped/petition.html

       Last night's match at the Telstra Dome between Collingwood and the Western Bulldogs has displayed the urgency to see if the playing surface is safe to play on.  There were uncountable mistakes in the last 2 nights' action from the "Dome", a majority of players slipping over.  A player has had his season ended as he did his knee, slipping over, on the boundary line. The AFLPA must not take this lying down. Testra Dome's surface is deteriorating AGAIN and should not be tolerated.

       There is no doubt that Pirtek Racing's Marcus Ambrose has being driving with great skill so far this season. But if he was taken aside, Ford would be in serious trouble.  Ambrose has a 58 point advantage over Castrol Perkins Driver Steven Richards. The next Ford driver is Russell Ingall, who is on 808 points.  This means that if Ambrose gets disqualifyed, as he should have been after the Queensland 300, it would be like losing the edge over the feild. even a no result will puncture the blue oval's chances of back-to-back championships.  Look at Greg Murphy. He was right in with a shot heading into the Round 6 meet, but crashed on the first turn. He retired and therefore dropped 192 points to Ambrose.  In other words: if Ford lose Ambrose, They're screwed.

       English Captain David Beckham has demonstrated a decline in form, leaving a major issue for Ove Andersonn: Is Beckham the prime choice for penalties?  He demonstrated his slump in the Euro 2004 Quarter Final match against Portugal, when he blasted the ball into row Q. A toe poke if ever i've seen one...  Back to the point. Beckham has missed 3 penalties in a row. Once an accident. Twice a Coincidence. Now that Beckham has missed AGAIN, it leaves me with 2 hypothesis':  1)He's being payed to miss from an outside source, or 2) His reached his peak and is now declining.  After all, it was David who said himself that the ball would be easier to control in dead ball situations. It showed in the Quarter's, didn't it?  I'm willing to hear what you have to say on the matter. leave a comment...

       Hawthorn, on Monday, Decided to terminate the contract of their coach, Peter Schwab.  At the board meeting, the likes of Dermott Brereton and Jason Dunstall along with club president Ian Dicker, decided that the club need a new figurehead.  "The board felt it was in the best interest of the club to establish a playing and coaching staff that will be part of that long term strategy." Dicker said.   Schwab, in the pre-season, was ambitious of winning the flag. Pity that the opposite has happened...  Does this mean that Schwab will be one of many cuts to Hawthorn? I only see one cut needed, and that's who's directing the club.  With that said, I put it to you now to voice your opinions. Tell me what you think...
