      Yes.  Yes it is.  Well here I am.  Today has nothing of merit to report.  My roommate Matt did not renew his contract for fall/winter.  Kyle (sr.) has bought it.  Kyle's a good guy and I look forward to him living here.  However, I was hoping some new guy would move in... breath some new life into this apartment.  Ah well.   And tomorrow is August.  My how time flies.  Matt and I need to get our hometeaching done as well.  It should be easy... we have one girl to get, and the two men are also our hometeachers, so we'll just do it together.  It just has to get done.  I need to get on a better sleep schedule.  One o'clock would be an excellent time to go to sleep.  Generally I get caught up in something stupid like playing Halo with the roommates or something of that nature.   Well folks, have a good night, I know I will.

       urlLink Kerryopoly - Can You Afford to Live Like John Kerry?   I was referred to this site by a friend.  He's the same friend who got me politically active and actually voting.  Anyway, Kerry must be very very glad to have Heinz-Kerry as his wife.  I had no idea what kind of salary a senator would have.  But apparently it's six figures.  So that $9.18 million vacation home among other things must have been from Heinz-Kerry's dowry.  Now I do think marriage is very important and I'm sure the Kerry couple love each other very much.  But this is the first time that I've seen how he lives and how well, he cannot afford even a quarter of it by himself.  I wonder how he will balance our nation's checkbook.

      So, I've been working on writing my own murder mystery.&nbsp; I think I started this thing about two years ago but just put it away till now.&nbsp; I've gotten pretty far with it too.&nbsp; I have all the characters' backgrounds and motives finished.&nbsp; Now I have to figure out the sequence of events, the clues, and the acquaintances.&nbsp; I look forward to getting it finished and trying it out.&nbsp; I don't know, I enjoy making new creative things from stuff I see.&nbsp; I did it as a kid and I continue to do it now.&nbsp; I think my biggest problem is sticking with it.&nbsp; I'll get far in a project and then get bored and put it away for a long time.&nbsp; But eventually they get done.  So the weather here has been very interesting.&nbsp; We've had overcast days, rainy days and cooler temperatures.&nbsp; My mom told me that we haven't had a day over 100 yet.&nbsp; All this is good for my garden though.&nbsp; The plants are really taking off.&nbsp; Jill needs to get a lead testing kit to make sure that we can eat the onions.&nbsp; The garden is right next to the house so we're afraid of the lead paint.&nbsp; But the peppers are still good.&nbsp; (and the best part of the garden anyway.)&nbsp;

      Senator Clinton claims that the desire to remove Bush from office has "has united Democrats from all ends of the political spectrum."&nbsp; Democrats from all across the nation are gathering for the Democrat National Convention.&nbsp; There has been an effort to make the overall theme of the convention more positive in order to sway undecided voters to the Dems.&nbsp; I find this hilarious!&nbsp; I know that a lot is possible through the magic of acting and computer graphics (look at The Day After Tomorrow as an example).&nbsp; But how can you make a campaign that is based on one great negative, 'I am NOT Bush' into something positive?&nbsp; I don't think Hollywood (and don't think that they wouldn't do it) with all it's power could even achieve that.&nbsp;   I'm as well finding out that Kerry is a good representative for the Democratic Party.&nbsp; It seems the speakers at the convention are split on how critical they should appear of the current administration.&nbsp; This is certainly a chicken and the egg question:&nbsp; Does Kerry's indecision reflect that of the Democratic Party or vice versa?&nbsp; It seems at least someone moderate won out as the Democrat National Convention's theme this year is:&nbsp; "Stronger at Home, Respected in the World."&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have expected something like:&nbsp; "Stronger than Bush, Slave to the World."&nbsp; It will be interesting to see if the desire to draw more voters to the Democratic vote through moderacy will prevail over the unifying hatred of Bush.&nbsp; I'll place my bet on hatred.

      So I've been challenged by my friend Aaron to write some "trenchant political thought" on my blog. Coincidentally Aaron started his own blog on this site just days before I did. I was recently looking at some political cartoons on Yahoo. They suggested that Bush wants to go to war with Iran. Talking to Aaron I found out that Bush has promised that if he is re-elected Iran will be next on the list. He gave me an article from the Times about that.   The United States would not use military force, as in Iraq, but “if Bush is re-elected there will be much more intervention in the internal affairs of Iran”, declared the official, who is determined that there should be no let-up in the Administration’s War on Terror.     &nbsp; Now if this statement remains true and we don't use military force, I can handle that.&nbsp; But I fear that if the first intervention does not prove fruitful that our President will use military force to achieve his goals.&nbsp; And truth is, I (and many other voters I'm sure) are tired of war.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm quite sure that if there were a vote as to whether we started a new war, America would vote NO.&nbsp;   Bush is looking less and less appealing.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, there is no way I will vote for Kerry...&nbsp;   The article talks about striking at Iran's nuclear facility before they receive fuel rods from Russia so that we can avert an environmental disaster.&nbsp; It also speaks about France, Germany, and Britain wanting to defuse the situation through diplomacy.&nbsp; That sounds typically European.&nbsp; I don't think that diplomacy will succeed.&nbsp; But if they are going that route, you can be sure that they will be most upset when the US rushes in and uses "aggressive negotiations" to solve the problems.&nbsp; Kerry would allow the French president to move into the White House.&nbsp; Bush on the other hand ignores the world community and does what Bush wants to do.&nbsp; I'd like to see a more moderate approach.&nbsp; I'd like to have the support of the EU, I'd like to be a little more friendly.&nbsp; Right now we're the inconsiderate neighbors who play the loud music at odd times in the night and whose dog craps in your lawn.&nbsp; I think that needs to change.  Well, I don't know if that is trenchant by any standard (forceful, effective, and vigorous).&nbsp; But it's a start.&nbsp;

      Okay, so this is my first blog entry.&nbsp; This came about because of a game of Halo about half an hour ago.&nbsp; I did the best I have ever done.&nbsp; It was team slayer and I was with Joe.&nbsp; Anyway, my score was 30 of 50 kills.&nbsp; Dan was with Kyle and Dan only had 6 kills!&nbsp; I was dang happy.&nbsp; I said something that if I kept a journal of Halo, this would definitely go in it.&nbsp; Anyway, here I am starting my first blog.&nbsp;   Now what else.&nbsp; Finished cleaning checks today.&nbsp; I did the bathroom.&nbsp; And well, it was really easy.&nbsp; Last month Matt had the bathroom and was all complaining.&nbsp; I personally don't think it was that hard at all.&nbsp; Probably easier than the fridge (which is what I normally do.)&nbsp; I ended up going to bed at 5 am.&nbsp; Kristen called me at 10.&nbsp; So only five hours of sleep...&nbsp; It'll hit me tomorrow.&nbsp; Kristen likes this guy and has been hanging out with him a lot.&nbsp; She wanted some advice.&nbsp; It's hard though to judge a guy when you've never met him or aren't around him though.&nbsp; But it was very good talking to Kristen.&nbsp; She said that she's needed me.&nbsp; And well, that felt really good.&nbsp;   Well today is the 24th:&nbsp; Pioneer Day.&nbsp; Chris and Franzis were over yesterday to celebrate that and their two year anniversary of meeting.&nbsp; They met in the parking lot to the west of our house.&nbsp; That was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Now they and Chris' family are on the way to Zion and the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; I'd like to plan a trip to Vegas and the Valley of Fire.&nbsp; Now that would be fun.&nbsp; Hot.&nbsp; But a lot of fun.&nbsp; I really don't mind the heat though.&nbsp; Just as long as I am prepared.&nbsp; Which in general I am.&nbsp; Well, I don't have to tell  everything  in my first blog, so I'll log off.&nbsp;   Thanks for reading.

      Today was the first day of BYU Education Week.  I had an excellent time.  I went to several Book of Mormon classes to get ideas and learn more for my Gospel Doctrine class.  Let me tell you I learned some incredible things.  But I will save another blog spot for Ed Week.  I also have lunch with my mother every day at the Morriss Center.  Free food and talking with my mom, that's always great!  I ought to get to bed soon so I don't sleep through more classes than I'd like.  But before then I will refer you to some of my favorite sites.   urlLink Sluggy Freelance comic   A lot of fun and very creative.  Joe referred me to it, so you know it has to be good!   urlLink Homestarrunner.com   If you don't know this pull your head out of the oven and go look!   urlLink Dr. Devious vs. Lincoln High   Spies, supervillians and mayhem in high school.  Devious!  And on a closing note, Romania's women gymnasts took gold!  Yeah that's right!  In your face pompous Americans!  Go home and cry on your gilded pillow.  (For Kate and those other Romania haters.)

       urlLink John Kerry's military service:    My friend Joe just sent me this link. Seems our good friend Kerry has not been very honest about his military service. That makes me uncomfortable to have a military commander in chief and leader of the free world dishonest about his own military service.  As Reed would say, "BAAAAAH" (buzzer noise).

      So call me unpatriotic...  I root for those who oppose the United States.  And if it's Romania... I'll even trash talk.  The way I see it, the US is in the spotlight all the time.  It pleases me to see other countries win.  It please me to see the US currently places seventh in overall  urlLink gold medals .  I like seeing the underdog win.  Now when it comes to gymnastics Romania is not the underdog.  They are the team that all the other teams are judged by.  And a wonderful quote I heard twice today, "If you leave the door open even a little bit the Romanians will come in and eat you alive."  Yeah, that's right!  We'll eat you alive!  (Notice the use of the pronoun 'we'.)  And I'm proud to see Romania is a serious competitor in many other events.  But they need to win in gymnastics.  GO ROMANIA!!   ESTI CEL MAI BUN!

      The California court decided that the rule of law is worth considering.  Actually, it decided that San Francisco's Mayor Gavin Newsom overstepped his authority by issuing homosexual marriage licences.  Nearly 4,000 marriages were nulled.  Of course Mayor Newsom has the enduring respect of gay and lesbian people across America.  And of course the disdain and anger of those against same sex marriages.  But I think another large issue is forgotten behind all the controversy of same sex marriages.  We have a system of law here in America.  We do not live in the feudal ages where a lord could make and break his laws at his whim.  Newsom ignored that system and did what he felt was right.  Whether he declared marijuana legal, Saddam the King of America, or leash laws unconstitutional, it's all the same.  He doesn't have that right!  Mayors don't have that ability.  So what I'm wondering:  What is the punishment for breaking the law?  You law people, is there precedence?  I'm thinking that he should lose his position as mayor and perhaps serve jail time.  If there is no punishment, then there needs to be one appointed.  'If there is no punishment, there is no law.'  People need to know that choices like that have consequences.

      Yes, I went and saw the Village tonight.  My cousin Stephanie invited me to go with a few of her friends.  We were supposed to see Napoleon Dynamite (and no, I have no clue what it is about).  But it was sold out, so we went and saw the Village.   Which by me, is a much better choice.  Now I won't give anything away...  but it is different from the other M. Night Shyamalan movies.  Still some twists and surprises, he doesn't ever disappoint when it comes to that!  I will give it four stars out of five.  Rated against his other movies, it falls behind Signs and Sixth Sense but way ahead of Unbreakable.  Now for our trenchant political commentary:  Several days ago I was reading some critics' reviews of The Village.  (How's that for a tie in?)  And one critic said that the political commentary in the movie got in the way of the plot.  What political commentary you ask?  Well, I would suggest you only read the following if you have seen the movie so that you won't be looking for it and thus ruin the movie.  You have been warned.  This critic believes that the movie was a commentary about Bush and how he leads the country.  The leader of the village is named Walker, George W. Bush's middle name.  As well the colors yellow and red play an important part in the film.  This critic believed that just as Walker ruled his village through fear, Bush does the same thing with us.  The war in Iraq must be a diversion to keep us from looking at the shortcomings of this presidency.   First of all, I will disagree that M. Night meant to have The Village be a parable for current American politics.  It's too far of a stretch.  Secondly, I disagree that this war is a political ploy.  If it is, it failed miserably.  Watching CNN which I often do, (and I am told is more on the democratic side of things, but which I find much more unbiased than the step-above-a-tabloid Fox Network) there are a lot of stories talking about other pressing issues outside of the war.  Same sex marriage, the economy, employment rates and the like seem to be very important.  Fear is something we've put upon ourselves, not by Bush.   I believe that companies (especially airlines) have seen this new demand for security and are taking advantage of it.  The safety precautions are merely to make customers feel safe.  I (half) jokingly suggest we have pre-9/11 and post-9/11 flights.  And I will tell you truthfully I would ride the post-flights if it meant I can forgo all of the 'needed' security measures.  And I will also hold my opinion even if there is another large terrorist attack on this country.   On a lighter note, I think I have found Kerry's long lost twin brother.  Ironically his twin is President.  In fact, he is president of a planet, Planet Neutral.  Their motto is:  'Live Free or Don't.'  And when in danger, they go to Beige Alert.  Yeah, so I watch Futurama, what of it?

      As the title states, today was fast Sunday.  And it was a beautiful one as well.  Many testimonies were born on missionary work and missionary experiences.  It reminded me of how good it is to have someone you know learning about the Gospel and accepting it step by step.  It is a faith and testimony building process.  But not only for the investigator, but for the members involved.  I would like to share the Gospel with someone.  I'd like to feel those feelings again which were so strong on my mission.  Sunday School went very well too.  Kate taught the class I was in.  It was in Alma, around chapter 40 I believe.  Alma was giving advice to his sons.  This lesson included my favorite chapter in the Book of Mormon, chapter 38.  I chose that as my favorite scripture on my mission.  It seemed like the perfect advice from a father to a missionary son.  But the lessons learned there apply to me at all times.  It was very good to hear it again.  It's prompted me to seek some positive changes in my life.   We had break the fast after Church and it went very well.  There was plenty of food and lots of people showed up.  And then started raining.  Beautiful summer rain.  We moved into the laundry room.  But the rain is so nice.  Cooling and beautiful.  I like this.  I wouldn't want it all the time, but summer rain is pleasant.
