      Blast Inquiry Essay  &nbsp;The first time I went to the Blast program I thought that it was going to be very boring. Now that I have some knowledge about Blast I now know that it can be fun to do work and have fun at the same time. I always thought we were going to do work in all the classes all day and then we go home. I was wrong I had a lot of fun the first few days. Well I still am having a lot of fun. It’s best for me that I attend this summer Blast program. I would have nothing else to do at home that just being lazy at home. Going to this Blast program has given me a different perspective about college. I thought that college was just going to school and party. Some of it is true, but I understand better now. The first day I was here I only knew one person and that person knew more people, so I know more people now. Well I have gotten to know mostly everyone. I think that college is a big deal now because it can get you a better job that pays you well. You can study on whatever you want to. You can even study about what you are good at. I had plans for my future, but they have changed. I hope I get a chance to go to college in the future. Economically, college can help, but owing money is too difficult to handle. I have a sister that might be going to college. I’m next, I’m a sophomore in high school my sister is a senior in high school. One more year for my sister and she is off to college.&nbsp; I still have a few more years to go. But I’m still planning to go to college or a university. In this summer program we have gone to  urlLink Washington Park ,  urlLink Lincoln Park Zoo , and urlLink  Fermilab  for the past 3 weeks in this program. We will also be going to the Museum of  urlLink Science and Industry  and  urlLink Six Flags . &nbsp;I’m looking up to going to both of these trips. I think that the reasons for these trips are to learn about what the world is really about.&nbsp; Trips can help us to understand about information we didn’t know about. They can also be fun and informative about things. &nbsp; Traveling across the U.S. to go to a school that teaches what you want to learn can be fun if you are really dedicated to your studies. Is traveling for you? Do you need to travel to go to the college of your needs? Well luckily I don’t need to travel outside the U.S. to study to be a Graphic Designer. The only thing I would have to travel for would be if I am called from,  urlLink Rockstar Games , a game developing company in New York City or In San Diego California.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This picture shows a student learning from a teacher in group A's math class. Success can't be achieved alone.&nbsp; There will be times when one will need help in college.&nbsp;One can learn from&nbsp;their mistakes, but better to learn from a teacher. This picture shows&nbsp;that you can ask questions and get answers. It's better to ask than not to say anything at all.&nbsp;Don't be afraid to ask questions to problems you don't understand.&nbsp;   (Picture will be posted soon)

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For the past 3 weeks I've been in the Blast program&nbsp;I have learned a lot. From&nbsp;fieldtrips to&nbsp;classes. Last two weeks we went to Washington Park and we had teams put together and had to come across some obsticles. Then we had planned to go to Henry's Farm,&nbsp;but there was some unforeseen circumstances. We ended up going to Lincoln Park Zoo. It was fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm looking forward going on more fieldtrips. These fieldtrips are not just fun, but&nbsp;one can learn too. The&nbsp;classes at Northeaster&nbsp;are great. The teachers&nbsp;help us understand subjects that are boring in a fun and interesting way.&nbsp;They make subjects look easy, the way they explain it.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At high school the teachers try their hardest to make every subject complicated, but I catch on fast. I know that high school teachers don't try to make it hard for&nbsp;students but the problem is that the teachers don't have another way or method to explain the subject.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the classes, the teachers put us in groups so we can figure some problems out. Its interesting because you don't know who you are going to end up with in your group. Or sometime we just get together with other people we know.
