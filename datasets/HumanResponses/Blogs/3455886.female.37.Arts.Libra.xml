						   The best friend I refer to here in the second posting - former female best friend - is the mother of my fiance...

The other best friend i refer to in the Long Days of Silence is someone without whom I would not have gotten through some very hard times of my life if he wasn't there to listen to me whine, make me laugh and sometimes give me a perspective on things I may not have seen otherwise...
So, I raise a glass to you my friend...
May you always choose the road on which you were meant to be.

						   Another day come and gone.  Most of it in deafening silence of my new world.  The rest in small whispers.  When I can even make a sound at all...
Physician says no whispering even until more testing is done...
How to stay silent to one's future spouse and one's best friend?
Most of it is forced upon me as thier is no sound...there is no choice given...
Strange using a computer to telephone my dad and say that I love him - in a voice that is not my own - but a creation of a computer program.
While I am grateful that such a program exists...well, I am sure I need not explain.

I live in a new world now.  Not one of my own creation, but one created for me.  One I did not want or ask to be in. And yet I am here.

A friend of mine told me about this site tonight. Very cool.  Helped to take my mind off of other things.  Lose myself in the dark, misty, fog covered world of ghosts, vampires, dungeons and the realms of the undead...
Yeah i know, strange type of stress relief.
But then again...I am strange...

						   You say hello to someone and you do not know where it will take you.You fall in love, find happiness - and because of this, your best friend has now become your worst nightmare.  It causes him pain you wish you could erase, this man you love.  Assured by him that life would be a blank endless torment without you - you try to brave the storm and shield him from the lightening.  
But then, he wants to protect you when he sees the lightening hitting you as you stand, arms out, unwilling to move lest he be hurt by someone who shouldn't be acting this way.
Hostility only escalates in the one who has become evil.
Vital parts of your life become jeopardized.  
And now, you must fight back - not to fight back would be to fail the one you love, and yourself.

						   and the cloak of The Dunedian is raised for a while tonight.
I have never used one of these before, but it seems to me to be a useful way of putting one's thoughts, frustrations and feelings.  Especially when one cannot articulate them anymore.
An attacker took away my speaking voice - but he cannot take away my Inner Voice - the one I can reveal here.
I will write more here as I learn to wind my way around the halls and caverns of this journal.

						   All this time to be fighting for the truth.  Two months spent in a life altering silence.  Seeking justice and running into walls.  Determined to break them down and reveal what has been done to me.
Arrested.
Finally he has been arrested.  This arrogant, violent, alcoholic who thought he could do as he pleased with my life.  Literally.  Emergency room, specialists, doctors, computer programs so I can use the telephone & "talk" to my family - people say hello or tell me to have a nice day - not understanding why I cannot answer them back anymore.  To those who called it "he said, she said" even amid the doctors, police reports, investigation - to them I say this...
Put some duct tape over your mouth for two months and see how much your life changes when you cannot speak.  For me, it will be much longer...but at least then maybe you would have an understanding of what has been done to me.  
To those who said "i'm not going to do anything about him, let the police handle it" - well, now the police have.  How did it feel, the public display of an employee of yours being arrested?
You have known all along what he was and is.  Yet you chose to be blind, to be deaf and to be ignorant.  Even to the point of endangering someone.  Someone who trusted you - someone who called you friend.  Betrayal, confusion, hurt, anger, shock and dissillusioned and fear.  This has been my world since that day.

						   Alas I grew up without it...
not without the presence of someone who life tells us is supposed to be that way.......
Why do I bring this up?  Someone very dear to me has been disowned by his "mother".  Her only child.  To her, he may as well be dead.  Her words, not my own.  
And why is this?  What horrific thing could he have done to cause such hatred and loathing by the woman that bore him?
He fell in love, and ......OH......God forbid, he is going to marry the girl.  Why does mother object to the one he has chosen to be with?  
The WORST reason, a reason that NO mother should thrust upon her son...
JEALOUSY.
This evil young woman, has committed a serious crime.
She has taken the mothers son away from her.
Mom believes her son must always be hers and only hers.
Now she must punish him for his unforgiveable crime of falling in love...
of loving another woman - and not just his mother like she believes is the way it should always be.
His love, this girl...
her heart aches to see how this causes him such pain.  He has no father to go to; now he says, he has no mother...........
He has tried over and over again to speak to this woman that bore him.  Now he has given up.
What do you do with a "mother" who goes so far as to tell others that she has no child when they ask?  It is as if he never existed to her.
She is rendering into shreds a part of his soul that no parent has the right to do.

						   I have not written in a few days.  I am feeling much overwhelmed.  So many things I am not sure how to deal with.  Other things I am, it is just so much at once.

						   Strange having his mother back in his life, and consequently trying to get back into mine.  Can't get over the irony of suddenly being invited on major family outing with them because of two things...
1. his mother has done everything she possibly can to get rid of me, even trying to get me evicted from my home.
2. his mother's boyfriend - well, there is a real piece of work.  Abusive, violent, and a sexual predator. Treating his mom like shit.
I'm having to deal with him and his boss in court...long story, can't put on here right now.  Not till after.

I fear alternative motives are afoot with the sudden and total 180 turnaround towards me.  I do not trust the situation at all.  Believe me, I have reason not to.

						   Going through a lot.  Attacked and left damaged.  three months now.  alone. almost always quiet.  the deafening silence of a lost voice in the fog and darkness.
Days blend together.  Chaos, anger, resentment, pain, betrayal, trust broken, dreams lost.
Each day brings more pain, confusion, frustration.
Lonley, incredibly lonley.
People expecting too much of me now.  I can't fit what they want.  Even more broken than I already was.
Rumors, lies, no basic honesty in man.  What would have happened to my world if I had died that day?  He almost killed me.  
Just those words bring terror, disbelief.
Brief moments of wishing i had died.  The rest is torture.  Feels like my soul is dying slowly.

						   my fiance's "nana" died monday morning of cancer.  she lived in canada and it is devastating him that we cannot afford to drive out for the funeral.
my little sister has to go back again for more cancer surgery........
my landlord is a jerk
the maintanence man here is a first class creep who should be fired...
the place I once called my second home has now become a place of pain, bad memories and a huge reality check as to who my friends really are.......
the place i am supposed to move to fired the leasing agent handling my rental application - so first I was approved - now I am told I am not.............I'm not letting them get away with that.......
a person I used to know tried to steal my identity for his own use credit wise - messed up my phone bill, credit report etc.....going nuts trying to get it all straightened out...........
what the h*ll is wrong with people anymore????
almost no one cares about the people around them at all.
Just a bunch of walking, selfish zombies out there anymore - and if you find a real human being, or try to be one yourself - those "zombie" people try to do whatever they can to kill your spirit and make you just like them..........it makes me sick.
