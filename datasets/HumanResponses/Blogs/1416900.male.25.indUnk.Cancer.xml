      I'm going to San Diego on Sunday and will be there for a week. There are a number of things I'm looking forward to doing, but I wanted to know if anybody else (that has been there) knows of any places or activities or whatever that I should *make sure* we don't miss while we're out there. I just don't want to forget anything. I already plan on going to the San Diego Zoo and In-and-Out Burger. Other suggestions?

      I've been reading Walker Percy's  Love in the Ruins  for the past few wweeks now, and the further I get into it, the more I like it. After my conversation with you, Jeremiah, I made myself care less about the lapsometer's functionality and in doing so have started to appreciate the deeper facets of the story much more. I am thoroughly enjoying becoming fully immersed in Dr. Thomas More's growing paranoia and fleeting love affairs. I've got a chunk of time tonight by myself with nothing to do, so I'm planning on using that to get some more reading done. I thank you for giving me something to look forward to this evening.

      Well, it seems as though Matt Pamer has died. As such, we fellas making a weekend out of Lebowski Fest is not looking good, which is not to say that I'm not still up for it. But if that continues to fail to materialize... Jeremiah, last night we talked of you coming to MI in June. The dates for that weekend we discussed are June 26 + 27 (Sat + Sun). If you'd like to make it a longer weekend, that'd be great, but I'd understand if you had to go back for work or school or whatever. Two days doesn't seem like enough time for us to catch up, though. Another bit of news that may entice you to visit that weekend... Pedro's playing at the Magic Stick in Detroit on the 27th (of June).

      Guys, come on! Are you just being indecisive or what's going on? I've proposed a chance for all of us to hang out for a weekend, and nobody has made a peep about it. Are you forgetting that we haven't seen each other in almost TWO YEARS??? Let's go to Lebowski Fest and have a freaking good time!  I should've known better not to expect an RSVP for Lebowski 6.19, since I never even got one when you were IN my wedding...

      I just thought I'd mention this... Blogger now has a comment feature. So when you respond to someone's post, just respond by making a comment instead of creating a whole new post. That will make everything on this blog nice and clean. When you click to leave a comment, you'll be asked to log in to your blogger account because I have it set so only members of this blog can leave comments. One other thing: if you have not yet, take a minute to create your Blogger profile. You can upload a picture and stuff. It's similar to a Friendster page, but no testimonies and no desparate pleas for a date. Anyway, that's all.

      Ok, I thought maybe you and Matt would have gotten my email, went to my own blog and then responded about going to the 3rd Annual Lebowski Fest. But I obviously assumed wrong. So maybe you'll answer me here...want to meet me at  urlLink Lebowski Fest ? Let me know your thoughts. I think it'd be friggin' awesome!!!

      dear michaelgabriel,  i actually got that new ptl album about three weeks or more ago. dave and i had been emailing back and forth about some things, and he ended up sending out a free copy for me before the release. at first i didn't like it as much as the last two ... i really went in for the whole concept album bit ... but after listening more i have to agree that it's really good. really good. i don't know if i think it's better than the last two, but i do think it's as good. ??have you heard the new mum??? who else is on this blog?  love, jeremiah

      Did anybody else pre-order the Pedro album from Jade Tree? I got my copy in the mail yesterday, two weeks prior to its release. Granted, I've been listening to an illegal copy for the past two months, but anyway, now I got the real thing with all of Jesse LeDoux's artwork and everything. It's nice. Anyway, if anyone else has it, I want to know what you think of the album. I think it's Bazan's best offering since "It's Hard to Find a Friend".

      Jeremiah. I just found out, after you bought your plane tickets, that I can't take off any of those days that you'll be here. Plus, they want me to work Saturday, too. So it kinda sucks, but you'll be all alone during the day until about 3:30 each day. But then we can hang out and have a good time. Is that cool? Oh, actually, can we just meet at the Dairy Queen in on Middlebelt Rd. near the airport for some lunch, like on that Sunday? That's really all that I have time for.   *this is all just a joke
