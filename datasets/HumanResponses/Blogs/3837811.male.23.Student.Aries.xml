      Practically, the whole morning and early noon i was feeling damn pissed-off.. Except the part where i see the kids.. lol  Lets start with the morning, i was supposed to step out of my house at 630am, but woke up at 635am..lol... Oh well, so i had to rushed to work by cab.. no choice. But, i got on the cab and i told the driver, Gan Eng Seng PRIMARY School.. Im sure i said PRIMARY coz i said it twice. Then the driver drove me to Gan Eng Seng SECONDARY School.  I told him, PRIMARY school leh. He shouted, "PRIMARY ar, aiya, u told me SECONDARY. " I retorted," I told you PRIMARY!" He said, "U said Primary meh?" I wanted to fucking punch his face, but i shouted angrily," NEVER MIND LAR! " Then he said nicely, "Never mind, primary school is down the road only, wont take up much of ur time." Fucking hell, one more from him, i will complain until his pants drop.  Ok, so i reached the school, saw my favourite group, i forgot about the matter already, lol.. Today GESPS had a carnival. Today is the actual day, where we see how the P5s will do presenting their bday party proposal and P4s selling their cookies. There is tis voting booth, for the parents to vote the best P5 group. So the teacher in charge asked my colleague to give out stickers for the parents to vote. My colleague was busy, i saw some groups not doing so well, so i, alone, ran around pushing and motivating the kids to drag parents to their presentation booth. And i was practically running around pushing them.  Then when i stepped out to the voting booth, my colleague push the box of stickers to me and said, "Your turn LAR, u only walk around only, i do tis for a very long time already." So i tot, FUCKER, i was running around and he said it like as if i doing nothing. But to avoid any quarrels, i said, "Ok lor, Never mind, I do lor." And the next ting he said, "I go walk around see see." VERY GOOD, first he said it as if i never do anyting, though i was running around, now he pushed the work to me and he go WALK WALK... Haiz, oh well... Since its the last day, watever then.. But shortly, the teacher in charge saw me really tired, so she asked one of the students to take over me and asked me to rest, at least someone appreciated me... But i cant rest, i saw the groups still not doing so well, i continued to push and motivate them.  Oh well, enough of that, lets go to the happy moments today.. took pictures of all the P5 groups, and before i can take pictures of the P4, their cookies were already sold out, so only managed to catch two groups to take pictures. One of the groups bugged me to buy their cookies, the moment they said "TEACHERRRR" my heart turned soft, LOL oh well so i emptied my wallet buying one pack of cookies from them. $4 and my wallet is empty, im TAT broke now.     My favourite P5 group. They jus cracked me up, especially the girl, Geraldine, on the extreme left      The winning P5 group. Em1 class, expected them to win...         The P4 group and their cookies, who and which, "declared" me bankrupt..   Haha, so the P5s were trying to force everybody to vote for their group, and it became like tis.....    Pasar Malam Style   After work, and i tot my day is over, finally, but someting happened again. As i was walking past the mac near my block, one fucker was playing the fucking soccer ball outside the Mac and he kicked the fucking ball to my shin. I was DAMN FUCKING PISSED OFF, i stopped, took off my earphones, stared at the fucker, heard his classmates laughing, i stared at those fuckers and they kept quiet. I stared back at the fucker, who tinks he is ryan giggs, and shouted in a guai lan voice, with a guai lan look (i called it the guai lan combo, lol), "Which school are you from?!" He whimpered,"Balestier." I stared at him one more time and walked off. *To my friend mel, can u feel the guai lan combo? lol"  Oh well, after tat finally reached home, and tat was about it, home is the only world tat does not piss me off. Great! lol   Current Mood: Pissed-off   Current Music: None

      Advertisements, u see it everywhere, inside and outside of buses/trains,&nbsp;underpasses, even as i'm typing now, some window might pop out and there u go, another ad. Practically every corner of my eye, there's an advertisement, but today when i was taking the&nbsp;mrt, the board around the escalator, tat indicates how long the mrt will reach the station.... another advertisement, just when i was worried that i might not catch the train on time and im running late. And&nbsp;the best ting is... it&nbsp;repeated the advertisement countless time and&nbsp;it didnt show&nbsp;how many mins the train&nbsp;will be&nbsp;reaching.. So?&nbsp;I just have to walk faster just in case the train reached already. So inconvenient.. What's important to me&nbsp;is how many mins, not how&nbsp;much is the product.. Come on man, why cant&nbsp;they just leave some important&nbsp;boards&nbsp;alone?&nbsp;Haiz.... Why like that? WHY???   My&nbsp;colleague smsed me at 9am plus two days ago, to ask whether i got a digicam. But, i read the msg and went back to sleep, so i forgot all about it until today. So i smsed him and told him, ya i got and i am bringing.. Tinking he doesnt have a digicam and&nbsp;he just wanted to borrow mine to take the pics of the kids..   But then, when i reached, he asked me, "Did u bring the cable to connect to the computer? I need to send some pics back to the company by 3pm" I was like SHIT, i dunno he needed it so urgently, and before i can say sorry, he said: "Never mind, i got bring digicam and cable."   I'm like "............................................................................................." Really speechless, if he already got the cam and cable, why did he ask me to bring in the first place?&nbsp;To tink tat&nbsp;i was worried&nbsp;for a while somemore... Haiz, why like tat? WHY?????&nbsp;   Anyway, im hooked on a jap anime series now, called Naruto.. Okok, i know im a bit slow, i heard about it a couple of months back, but im lazy to download..lol (guess its not a good excuse)..&nbsp;Its just so concidencial that my Sim Course-mate burn the episodes on cds, so she&nbsp;lent me the series until 57episode,&nbsp;haha going to&nbsp;borrow more tomorrow! yes! *Sorry "niece", for mentioning tis&nbsp;=X*&nbsp;       Favourite naruto character, Kakashi&nbsp;& Gaara, i just find them cool     Current Mood: Why like that?

OMG, i was like in shock, my shaver!! Its really unhygenic to share a shaver, and i dont know how many times my grandma had used my shaver without my notice, and i had been sharing with her..     &nbsp;  Why like that? My dad also used my shaver a couple of years back, i practically kpkb to my mum, and my dad bought his own shaver.. Now?? My GRANDMA!!!!!! OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG IM GOING NUTSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!    &nbsp;  Guess i better buy a new&nbsp;shaver and lock it in my drawer, im still tinking about how long my grandma had been using my shaver... EEEEKKKKKK    &nbsp;  Had to go out with a&nbsp;stubble on my chin, no choice! Met up my SIM course-mates, quite a fun bunch, but the big topic we were discussing, whether&nbsp;our acceptance into the SIM course by UOL is confirmed.... Some of my course-mates received a letter rejecting them, OH MAN, im scared now! I havent received any letter yet coz i submitted my application quite late... *FINGERS CROSSED*    &nbsp;   Current Mood: EEK     Current Music: Maroon 5 - This Love

        My slippers was in danger of giving way four days ago, but i didnt get a new pair, tot i might be able&nbsp;to&nbsp;wear it&nbsp;for a few more times.. On off today, so there's no lunch at home, had to da-bao.. By the time i was&nbsp;going out, i was feeling really hungry, so i rushed out, put on my  slippers  and rushed down the stairs.. And the front part of the left sole came out!!     &nbsp;         OMG, if this happened at the kopi-tiam, i might as well come home bare-footed..      &nbsp;     Heng sia, it came out at the stairs near my&nbsp;flat and&nbsp;not at the kopi-tiam, i cant imagine what will i do if it came out at the kopi- tiam.. lol..

      Today is racial harmony day, haha saw a lot of sec/pri sch students&nbsp;wearing traditional costumes of different races to school. I rem when i was in sec sch,&nbsp;i dressed in a&nbsp;traditional malay costume (borrowed from my dad's malay colleague), during racial harmony day.&nbsp;But the school i teach in did not ask the students to wear any traditional costumes, instead they organised games in the hall...       Asking non-chinese to sing Kit Chan's Jia        Asking non-indians to do Teh Tarik    Haha, at first when they demonstrate how to sing Jia, all the kids in the school sang, it was a warm and cosy&nbsp;feeling..

      As i was surfing other ppl's blog, i came across a blog talking about Lomography.&nbsp;Its about photography (with a tool called lomo cams)&nbsp;with no restrictions, no planning, just take and see how it goes..&nbsp;It can be of people, animals, things etc... These are some really cool pictures from the  urlLink lomography website.   &nbsp;        Cool lomos....  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;remembered the time when i was with my ex-gf, taking a camera around town one whole day&nbsp;and took pictures as and when we liked.. Not of us, but of&nbsp;things, happenings..&nbsp;But i have no idea where those pictures went, lol... Haha, oh well, i went&nbsp;on a snapping spree with my digi cam&nbsp;in my room, this is the best i came out with..  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Well, one of these days, i might just go around town and take some really lomo with a bit of help from photoshop.. Haha, cool&nbsp;way of taking photos..&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Great!  &nbsp;  Was on the mrt, then this guy's phone rang, some ah beng ringtone and i was damn irritated.. Still never mind, after answering his call, he played with his ringtones for like 15mins, i was really pissed.. Somemore he was acting cool, like as if its cool to play ringtones on mrt.. After that, blast his techno songs off his earphones, felt like going forward and give him a punch...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today took another Em1 class, tinking their presentations will be damn formal.. They actually came out with Phua Chu Kang quotes and Singlish... Haha, quite funny presentations they had today.. Robin only came to know that i am good frens with Kendra today, and he told me tings about work that Kendra shouldnt know, guess he must be tinking "Damn i shouldnt had told him all those ting", lol&nbsp; &nbsp;  Okie, so if u read my prev posting about the lady whose heels got stuck, and the guy with the bloody bag, u will know wat am i toking about.. Today, a guy did someting gross walking in front of me just now, he actually farted, a loud one somemore.. And i tink he didnt know i was walking behind, but then again.. haha i walked quickly&nbsp;and overtook him (dun wan to smell his fart lar),&nbsp;and i tink he&nbsp;felt paiseh when he saw me overtake him.. Just why must ppl do all these tings in front of me, why?  &nbsp;  My mum was back for the weekend from my sister's house, and had the dinner she cooked again, yes!

      On my way to work today, saw a lady wearing a pair of heels walked in front of me, and i noticed, how ugly her heels looked. But b4 i can say "what a pair of ugly heels", one of her heels got stuck into the cracks of the floor and her whole foot came out. lol, at least i didnt laugh...   Oh well, go to work today and took a class that i hate most.. Very noisy, very mischevious, very disrespectful.. Two boys were 'fighting' and i told them that their group will be deducted 5 points for their presentation and everybody went quiet, lol.. but after a while, oh well.. watever.. One boy asked me whether he can go toilet, and ended up four boys ran out with him, and i whispered "what the fuck" quite loudly.. OOPS, hope nobody heard me, lol...  Best still, the freaking form teacher dont give a damn, me and robin had a hard time... haiz  On the bus journey home, this freaking guy seated in front of me dont bother to take out his bag and put on his knee (which everybody does), so he sit down with his bag sling on one side of his shoulder, and the bag kept slipping off his shoulder and hit my knee.. And being already quite pissed-off whole day, i whispered "why dont u just take out ur bag and put on ur knee, you idiot.." And he didnt hear, so, watever.. lol  Ok, fine i will stop posting about my current underwear.. LOL.. Work early tomolo, sad case...  WEEKEND, i cant wait!

On my way to work, this stupid bee was bugging two ladies and after that, the damn bee came for me, yes! And it doesnt help that my company logo on my polo t looks like a flower somehow.

Total black, fierce.     Give me a break will ya?   Ok, so my colleague, Robin, was at the doc during the morning, so i need to take classes alone. For morning classes the P4s.. The first class was ok, coz the form teacher helped me out, and i apologized to her for the troubles. But the second class, the form teacher disappeared once the kids had entered the lab, and i was alone.. B4 i knew it, the form teacher complained to me that why are the kids running around? Oh, she is such a BIG help to me. Thank you very much! But soon after, my friend/colleague, Kendra, reached the lab, jus to help me with the second class while Robin is at the doc. Thank god, im saved!  Went lunching with Kendra after that and had a long talk about topics like cockroaches and bees. Lol, pests, insects, aint they cute? Robin came back in the afternoon and put me out of my misery.. Took the Em1 class today, and they scored really high, poweration.  Went home for my grandma's dinner, if u've read one of my recent postings.. U should know what i had for dinner... No prizes for correct guesses.. YES! EGGS! Egg-phobia is at level-9 now i tink.

      Went to work as usual, but today is the grading for their presentation, and we gonna pick the winning group..  Ok, so p4s got to bake cookies to sell, and p5s are bday party planners.. But I was embarrassed during one of the p5's lesson, Why? Coz I told them that we will compile the results with the results of the cookies.. And the best ting is, one of the girls said :"But Teacher.. We are not baking cookies..." Then i realised that i said someting wrong, DAMN MALU sia! And the manager from my company was sitting behind observing everything.. GONE! But he seemed like a nice guy, hope he didnt mind, LOL!  Oh well, in the mid of the lesson, a cockroach came out, and the kids were running around, lol. The form teacher, who is a lady, seems scared at that time, but she took out a tissue and tried to catch it, LOL. But b4 she can reach the cockroach, xiao qiang ran away to my side and im already armed with two tissue papers, so i caught it easily. I practically crushed the tissue paper in my hands and the kids said :"Teacher, dont crush it can? So cruel.." WTF, theres SPCA I know, but now theres SPCP (S'pore Prevention Towards Cruelty to Pests) ?   Whats with this sudden love towards pests nowadays? A few weeks ago, i caught a lizard in my room and i threw it away, and my fren said :"Aiyo, why kill it?".. I still rem that a long time ago, people always smack pests with slippers, newspapers, etc. And now? Crushing a cockroach/lizard in a tissue paper is cruel, so is smacking a mosquito on ur arm cruel? Mosquito is also a pest rite? Ermz... someone enlighten me please?  Ok, seems like a lot of ppl commented on me typing my current underwear in my blog, Im sure some ppl are interested to know rite?

While packing someting into my cupboard, i found an old key-chain that my ex-gf gave me last year. If u guys have noticed, novelty shops have been selling those kind of de-stress keychains where u squeeze the keychain and someting will pop out from the holes, and my ex-gf got me the pig keychain, where u squeeze the piggy and shit pops out from his asshole.. Haha, and i left it in my cupboard for so long it became like tis..     I guess i left tis piggy in the cupboard for so long and did not squeeze him to help him clear his bowels, he cant take it, and crapped himself, haha.. Look!

      Woke up early again just now! But theres not suzanne jung cause its a saturday, haiz. Need to settle course fees.. the whole chunk $7308 of it for year 1.. Went to the bank to get a bank draft of 43pounds to pay RELC the application fee.. Strange how SIM works, u pay them the course fees, but the application form to University of London need to be submitted to RELC.. Hmmz.. Oh well..  Went down to SIM first and asked about exemptions, went to the cashier to pay my fees, and the lady at the counter is a newbie! She seemed not too sure where to click and stuffs! And the worst thing is, her colleague teaching her half-hearted.. OMG, and i was tinking, my future is with ur mouse clicks DAMN IT! Asked the customer service people there and i discovered that my degree course does not have auto exemption for SP diplomas. Damn! But i tried applying for exemption, hope UOL will accept it...   And the lady asked me: "Do you know, you have to get the transcript in a sealed envelope to be submitted together with the form to RELC?"  And i said: "I thought i just bring the photocopies and let RELC verify?"  She said:"No thats for other courses, your course needs u to do so."  I was like "SHIT!", i need to get all these done, coz weekdays i will be working, i wont have time.. So i rushed down to SP's examinations office and the lady's attitude is damn fucked-up, giving me half-hearted help and answers.. And i only can get my transcript within 4 days, and by the time 4days is up, my application deadline is over! So i asked the lady whether she can just help me chop and seal the transcript i already have, and yes! My sealed and "untouched" transcript came out! Haha   Rushed down to RELC after that, and while waiting for the lift, theres a crowd coming, all submitting application forms.. This girl never filled her form properly and she missed out the part where we had to write an "essay" on why are u applying for this course.. The girl said: "Never mind, later i just write rubbish on it" and i was like WTF, i typed the essay on Word, went through spelling and grammer checks to make sure its perfect, and she said she's gonna write rubbish.. I dont really get it but oh well..   Called my friend, ben and told him about the sealed transcript part, and he told me he already laminated his transcript! What the hell.. That means he has to go down SP, and apply for the damn transcript, and hope he can get it done in time.. By the time he reached SP, the counter is closed, DAMN IT man.. Hope SIM can extend the deadline for him, haiz.. Troublesome shit, reminds me of the time when i was applying for poly..   Went straight home after all the shit, rushing here rushing there made me tired.. Took a nap and watched Joe Millionaire on chn5, its the final episode and the guy told the lady he chose, about the truth, and the lady didnt appear for the final part.. Oh.. another materialistic girl.. The poor guy went back to texas heart-broken but ended up, the lady came back! Oh, i was wrong about her.. True love, OHHHH haha...   And the winner is....   LOVE!!! LOL  No suzanne jung again, its a sunday, sad case, oh well looking forward to monday, but then again, need to work, HAIZ! Nothing is perfect...

      Suppose to step out of my house at 630am tis morning, and i woke up at 7am! Damn, ended up took cab down to SIM to attend the orientation at 8am. Suppose to meet my friend, Ben to go SIM together, ended up i asked the cab driver to go dover mrt to pick him up. When i reach SIM and found the crowd, i met up with my other friend, Gina.. And i turned my head, and saw the officer who was once my PC in camp. OMG! Was damn surprised, talked to him for a while and went back to my friends.  And i wrote my name on the list for my bachelor programme, i asked the student union guy wat will the programme be like, and he said that they will bring us to the track at ngee ann poly.. And i felt cheated! HAR! Ask me come here play game AR! My friend, Gina, used her charm to charm a guy into telling us details of the whole programme! HAHA, the guy told us that we can skip the bloody games and come back at 3pm to collect course materials. Ended up we went to Mac at clementi for breakfast, ben went back home to sleep and asked me to collect the materials for him, coz he damn tired and needs to go back camp later on...   Oh well, so i "nuah" together with gina and went down queensway shopping centre, she bought a bag and i was damn tempted, especially when the salesperson told us theres a compartment for laptop.. He asked gina to carry the bag and he pulled the bag down.. And gina dun feel the heaviness at all! DAMN! Who will be my genie and give me money for the bag! haha.   After nuah-ing till 3pm, went down to SIM again... Saw everybody holding on to course materials and we dont know where to get it.. So i asked a student union person, i told her: Sorry we couldnt make it in the morning, so we just came.. May i know where to get course materials? (Haha, or should i tell her about our stint in Macdonalds, Queensway and Ikea?).. So went up to collect our course materials, and to my disgust, i only can collect them when i paid for my course fees. OMG! And i only rec the letter three days ago! DAMN IT, one whole day wasted!   Oh well, so Gina got to wait for her bf to pick her up to go to some concert, as a samaritan, i accompanied her.. Went to coffee bean at Holland V to nuah and wait.. And got to know some sad news (read my prev posting for more info), sad man.  Listened to the cd i bought not long ago on my bus journey home... Damn hooked on it, haha...     LOVE TIS CD!  After that, i went home and my nephew & niece are there! Haha, had fun disturbing my nephew, and i used a piece of candy to make him call me uncle, haha so cute... And i chased him around the house, haha...   Got to settle all my course fees tomolo, wake up early again! ARGH!! DAMN!!

      My friend, Gina, told me some news today that really upsets me. My friend, Dan (who i didnt get to know well), passed away about 1 year plus ago. And i only knew about it now. Heard that it was because of love problems.... Haiz, love had already cause the death of a lot of people, killing people because of jealousy, committing suicide etc..  Why must this happen, is really love that important?   Love is sweet, but when things go bad, everything become bitter. Ur vision becomes bitter, ur tinking becomes bitter, and u tink that u will live a bitter life forever.. I understand, i've tasted it before.. But is it really worth sacrificing for it? I really dont think so... Life offers much more than love, how about your friends, parents, siblings, relatives? Sacrificing for love in exchange for the forever grief of your closed-ones is really not worth it. Dan, not being able to know u close enough is my forever regret. I had talked to you before, sit near you before, but we just aint close... And i regretted it..        And to my lecturer, Mr Pang, who passed away a few years back.. Thanks for the guidance u showed me, you will always be in my heart.  Dan, Mr Pang, i will forever remember the times that both of you were once by my side....       Semisonic - If I Run   Morning comes and morning goes  Now it's me against the sun  The day goes by and darkness grows  And it's over before it's done   Well I know it'll be alright if I just get on the road  If I run I can free my worried mind  Yeah I know on the day I die I will lose my heavy load  But I wouldn't want to leave you behind   All my time keeps creeping on  Now I've grown into a man  But Mr. Child still wants to run  From the cradle to the van   Keep thinking it'll be alright if I just get on the road  If I run I can free my worried mind  Keep thinking of the day I die when I lose my heavy load  But I wouldn't want to leave you behind.

But YES, she was still on, wonder what is the time she finish CNA work everyday, oh well.. CNA reported about tis baby named Jakob, makes me feel kinda upset, haiz.. See my prev posting for more info..   Going to work in a heavy feeling, but after putting up with the nonsense by the kids, i totally forgot about everyting. Only when its break time, i felt so upset about the whole Jakob thingy, i blogged.. Haha  I re-discovered one thing today, the girls are always the one writing up the presentation scripts and taking school work seriously.. The boys only play and dun do anyting.. I was totally pissed off, and i gave them a good scolding.. Haiz but im sure their form teacher had scolded them countless times, but they just wont listen! Haiz! Tinking back of my pri sch days, its quite true, im the playful one, and the girls are more hardworking, haha the art of hormones...   There's a new stunt by the pri sch boys, they bought those round-head pins and poke themselves in the arm to form a line or shape. Their form teacher asked them to stay back and i dont know what happened later.. Do u believe the tings they do now! I tink its their version of tattoo, really, i was like WTF...     The New Tattoo tool has arrived..  My colleague told me that the super "Lork Cork" kopitiam sells really good noodles, went to try it out, and its really TAT good! Most important of all, its only 2dollars, and the serving was quite big... Im saving lots of money eating at the school canteen already and the kopitiam noodles is so cheap! OMG! All the money saving stunts i learnt! Felt "cheap" today! haha     YEA BABY! Stretch TAT DOLLAR!  Oh well, today's meeting got postpone till tomolo, YES! Tomolo im off, got to go SIM for some orientation thingy, so i dont have to put up with watever nonsense the teacher is gonna say, but i do feel bad for my colleague...

      Watched channel news asia this morning, and they reported about this baby named Jakob died of brain disorder, a small life ended just like that. Seeing the parents of the poor baby crying in sorrow over their sorry lost, makes me sad.. I really hope they will be strong, and im really sorry over their lost... Do support their website at  urlLink http://kids.linsean.com/  , help the kids out there... Please...  Working as a education trainer, i see a lot of healthy kids in front of me everyday, though i do not have any kids, but being a parent is really not simple at all. Most importantly our parents just wan us to grow up healthy, nothing else really matters.. Ya theres problems like, bad company and stuffs, but the most important point is health. We managed to grow up without any major health problems, please show care and concern for those unfortunate kids out there who are sick, some dont even get to live till 10 years old, dun even mention our age..   Parents out there, no matter how rebellious ur kid is, please be happy that they are healthy.. We as children of our parents should understand all the pains our parents went through to bring us up. When i was young, my parents were always worried about my asthmatic condition, having an asthma attack always had my parents on the edge.. And i now sincerely thanks my parents for their care and concern for me, now im guilty of the times when i quarrel with them and being rebellious. Going into ns really straighten all my tots, my parents are the ones there for me, when im in trouble in school.. Yes they hit me, they scold me, but if they didnt do so when i was young, i might not be the man i am now.. Thanks dad and mum, definitely appreciate what u did for me..   Please, take care of ur own health and be fillal, do not make our parents worry, they had suffered enough.. and to parents of baby jakob, im really sorry for ur painful lost, nothing else can replace him, but do try to bring another new life in. Baby jakob, ur pain is over now, do rest in peace...  Current mood: Guilty and sad Current music: None

      Ok, my "niece" complained that i mention suzanne jung and ou xuan too much, so? tis is my blog! i wan to mention them as and when i like, haha. Suzanne and ou xuan a day keeps the doctor away, yes! lol  Switch on to chn5 in the morning and found out that copa america starts today, but, no time to watch, coz i will be slogging away, teaching kids to be good, like me. LOL    Today had raisin bread for breakfast, no more "Sor Ta Pia" YES! Haha, took mrt to work today again, now i finally agree it took much lesser time than 147, ok i love MRT now! Haha.     YESSSSSS............... NOOOOOOO.....   Same old story, most of the P4 kids did not do the presentation they supposed to prepare, oh well... But took a P5 EM1 class today, their presentations are almost perfect! POWER SIA! All points included, confident speeches.. They are THAT good..  Theres tis group from P5, only the leader was writing up the whole presentation, this poor girl, Alivia, was slogging away with the presentation scripts, while the boys were playing stupid games.. I gathered the boys and gave them a good scolding, i told them tat their parents was working hard to pay for this business course that they are attending, and they only know how to play a fool during class.. Some kids are not as fortunate as them to be able to afford this course.. And the next thing i knew, they went back playing more stupid games, and Alivia was writing and writing, dont they listen! But we told them off after class, saying that tis is about team work, not only the leader doing everyting.. but i dont think they will change, sad to say...   After work, my colleague told me, that the teacher who is in charge of the P4 level, filed a complaint about us, insisting that we did not do a proper job, thats why the P4 kids did not do their presentations. Although i just started on the job this week, my colleague told me that he had already mentioned it to the kids last week, and i trust him, the teacher is making a big fuss.. Have to go for tis meeting with her tomolo, haiz.. Complain complain..  Read the news on manutd.com, rooney is set to snub a new Everton 5-yr deal worth £50,000 a week. And man united might launch a bid for the england star, ok man united can launch all they wan, but dont sell Van Nistelrooy to get funds for Rooney, anyting but that!  My friend found Suzanne Jung's picture! YEA BABY! Actually i've tried searching for her pic, but then i found an ang moh old lady with the name suzanne jung, and i was like "......"    The Suzanne Jung imposter...    The REAL Suzanne Jung  Just discovered today that some singaporeans are just not considerate at all, yesterday nobody wanted to let his/her seat up for a pregnant lady, and tis Bitch was leaning on to the pole near the pregnant lady, and there she is, standing in a squeezy mrt without support.. And tis bastard today, lean on to the pole too and a lot of people dont get to grab on to the pole for support. Whats with this leaning on the pole thing nowadays, why dont these bastards and bitches, learn how to pole dance and entertain the passengers, since they like the poles so much. (Excuse the language)   Oh well, tomolo another day of work. And the meeting with the teacher, wooo, its giving me the jitters, hope i will see a rainbow tomolo and not dark clouds!     Carebears SHAREEEEE! (or is it care? hmmz) LOL  Current Mood: Disappointed Current Music: Sun Yan Zi - Sometimes love just aint enough

      Woke up to suzanne jung tis morning again lol, but i nearly cant woke up for work today, luckily my dad called me, or else, i will be really late for work! Haha, Thanks DAD! Anyway, ran out of muesli bars this morning, had to settle for two "Sor Ta Pia" (Plain crackers) for breakfast, Sucks man, lol but theres nothing else to eat.   After bathing, i found out tat im 15mins late if i wan to take the bus 147, so no choice, forced myself to take mrt to work, but this time it only took me 50mins to reach the school including the torturous walk from the mrt.. Hmmz got to reconsider my options now, MRT OR BUS..  The P4s are supposed to finish their presentation by today, but all the groups did not do at all! My colleague was damn fired up, scolded them for 5mins, seeing their sad faces, im also sad, but had to scold them..  The P5s are better, all the groups finished their presentations, and i had to pick out their mistakes and tell them wat to do with their form teacher standing behind me, and i felt this "pressure" behind me, phew~ glad its over today, but there are still a lot of such sessions to go within this week. HAIZ~  Got to know two mischievous P5 kids, Kevin and Suriya (i called him suria channel, haha), Kevin is the one tat kept disturbing me.. Haha kids... and kevin told me tat everybody in the school noes suriya, can see why, damn playful kid.. haha, but they are cute overall..  During their discussions, they had a lot of problems, not with the presentation, but within themselves! Haha, those pri sch bickering, i did it in pri sch before! Things like "dont friend u", "shut up",  hahaha. Pri sch politics!   Continue printing the brochures today, the printer gave no problems today, YES! Managed to finish a LOT of work!  Headed straight home as usual, with no extra $$ and feeling dead tired, how to hang out! Haha, went home to my Ou xuan at 9pm, and i heard liang ni's going to cover the olympics WOOHOO, i cant wait!  My friend who read my posting yesterday, knew that im mesmerized with ou xuan, and to my surprised! Ou Xuan is actually, her fren's fren! OMG! I was damn excited man! But due to her current star status, dun tink theres any chance to know her! hahaha, oh well...   WORK WORK WORK, tomolo work again, hope tomolo classes had finished all their presentations, or else will get scolding again.. Haha, Sleep time! Suzanne Jung tomolo morning again.. WOOHOO!

      YES!! The Greeks won Euro2004, wahahahaha, i lurvvvveee it when underdogs win. Greece 1-0 win with Angelos Charisteas 57th min header, ended Portugal's hopes of winning Euro in home turf.. Being an avid Manchester United Fan its sad to see C Ronaldo cry, but i just cant help it!! WOOHOOO.. Greece ROcks..    Im loving the MOMENT, wahahaha  In the middle of the match, this joker came on the pitch, ran around like some drunk buggers, taunting officials and ran into the goal net himself, talking about being netted, haha. He wore a t-shirt with this weblink  urlLink http://www.jimmyjump.com  ... Haha, i tried to go to the webbie twice but loading was damn slow, hope can get in one of these days.. haha    Figo NOT interested, haha  Today woke up to see Suzanne Jung on CNA at around 7+am. Wooo, i nearly forgot she existed, after sleeping till late noon everyday during my slack life. Haha. She is CUTE, now i will get to see her everyday before i go to work, haha.. Sad to say, i cant find her pic anywhere, tried mediacorp website, cna website, searched for it on Yahoo/Google images search, but to no avil. Lets just hope FHM do something about it. LOL  My colleague, who lives in Hougang, told me that taking an mrt is WAY faster than taking bus 147 to our workplace (Gan Eng Seng Pri Sch), so i went to take the NEL at Serangoon Station and transferred to Redhill at Outram Park. And to my disgust, it took me one hour to reach the school, including the torturous walk from redhill mrt to the school.. Just beat taking bus 147 by 15mins. I rather take this 15mins extra to alight right in front of the school gate, then to take the bloody walk. Haha    I LOVE THIS BUS!! LOL  I worked as an education trainer for my company, to teach the pri sch kids about doing business.. Those little angels wrote up a proposal, and learnt about doing a presentation to boost their business, so cute sia. P4 have to try to sell their cookies (yes they will bake the cookies themselves), P5 have to organise a party of 20 people.. Haha, dont see me doing that when i was in pri sch.. Anyway since today is youth day, there's no class, but need to help them print out the brochures they had done... so went back to the sch to use the printer.. Tinking i will be home soon, the printer is always jammed-up, or the network gives some stupid error.. JAM JAM! Arghhhh.. and we've got like 50 groups to print, And the printer/network kept Jamming, DAMN IT!    JAM IT! I rather have this kind of Jam, LOL  Anyway, seeing their brochures for the 1st time, i must hand it to them, coz if they really do biz themselves, i tink they will go bankrupt, but they are still kids, cant blame them.. wahahaha. Im sure they had been taught how to make a brochure attractive.. But these came out... Haha  Tip 1: Have more promotions, attract more customers, but.....    80% OFF!! Haha, why not organise party for free? LOL  Tip 2: Put in more colourful pictures, to catch customers' attention, But.....   Pokemon Number 55 Name: Golduck (evolution of Psyduck) Height: 170 cm (wooohhh shorter than me)  Weight: 77 kg  (wooohhh lighter than me) Haha, i not a fan of pokemon, got these info on the web, hahaha But what to do, they are still kids, haha, aint they cute doing these little brochures.. Awwwwww! lol  Headed straight home after work.. Damn tired after watching Euro this early Morning.. but i stayed up, to watch the 9pm chn8 show, OU XUANNNNNNNNNNNNNN, wahahaha. She is just so cute and pretty, OHHH MANNN.. hahaha, Suzanne Jung.. Ou Xuan.. Suzanne Jung... Ou Xuan ARRRRRR hahahaha... And after that, chn8 news, LIANG NIIIIIIIIIII.... OHHHH... HAHA, all these gorgeous babe just keep coming out, cant stand it, TV is my new best fren now...  Sianz, tomolo got to work again! Tomolo got classes, hope the kids are in a good mood, hahaha.

Nothing much to do today, went to buy pants for work alone, come to tink of it i got to work tomorrow, Arggh. Just dont feel like working after i started, feel like going back to my slack life before i start studies in SIM. But i need cash, so no choice..  Went jogging today, feeling lazy to jog, but got to do it. Haha, no pretty babes at the park today, just some kids fooling around.. Where is the babe with the dog... Haiz never saw her again ever since i saw her the first time, wonder which are the days that she will bring her dog for a walk, haha. Start to work on my website again, been a long time since i stopped, hope i can find time to complete it soon especially after working.. Should be crashing to bed soon, will be waking up to watch the Euro final, hope the underdogs Greece will win Euro2004! YEA BABY!

      Called up RELC and asked about my SIM status today, im approved!! Should get my offer letter by next week! YEAAA! Ok, back to the main topic..lol  As u guys know, im not working currently as there are no schools with vacancies for me to fit in, but anyway two more weeks and im studying at SIM, so wats important to me now is to study hard and get a weekend job to earn for my own keeps during my studies at SIM... My grandma was  OVER THE MOON  when i told her that i found a job last month.. But, being the money minded person she is, kept asking me why am i not working now, i had explained to her about the situation countless times, but she just kept going on and on about tis, after she had finished asking me, she asked my dad, my dad explained to her the situation again, and after that she asked my mum, and my mum explained to her AGAIN! Damn irritating sia, its like scratching a vinyl record on the turntable, replaying the same question over and over again! Seeing the chain here, (me -> dad -> mum -> who will she ask next? me lar!) Why cant she just get it? Does "not working = useless bum" true to her? Thank goodness my parents understand the situation that im in now, or else i might pick up a butcher knife from the kitchen and the rest is history.. lol  Who wants to stay at home and face her everyday? Endless nagging and questions, all my aunties and uncles cant stand her at all, oh well......  Not that i wan to say my grandma, its just that she practised favourtism in such an obvious manner.. To who? To those who are rich and those who can choose not to work but insisted on working... When my rich relatives visited us during CNY, her whole face and attitude changed... After my relatives had gone home, its endless nagging about how good being rich is.... But they are rich, so wat? My distant cousin wrapped an expensive Burberry scarf around her neck when she visited us, and she was so proud about wearing branded clothes, then her dad went on about how expensive her clothes are.. I was tinking, "Fuck lar, singapore weather so hot, wear scarf for fuck, somemore ur daughter so ugly, wear branded clothing also destroy them only, go and die lar." Cant stand rich people like that.....  Oh well, to me, its ok that my family is not rich, i've a caring family and nice friends, tats all i need to survive.. =) Tomolo is MtvFresh!!

      Today is delivery day for the TV, Recorder and Printer! YES, new stuffs are good......... As i was waiting for the delivery van, i heard a sound of a truck from my room, so i tot it might be the delivery van, but i saw tis red monster downstairs....     The siren wasnt on, but that didnt stop me from sticking my head out of my kitchen window to make sure the fire is not from above/below my flat... And in fact, there wasnt any fire, but the fire truck and the ambulance came.. hmmz.. strange  The delivery man explained to me how to use the DVD recorder and stuffs, but after trying out, i discovered that i couldnt watch Teletext on the TV, so i called up the salesperson and asked, but then.. hmmz... Lets just say i figured it out myself, and its neither wat the delivery man nor the salesperson explained. Oh well... Was a bit fed-up for a while...Anyway the DVD recorder is way cool then VCR, tried some recording jus now, the pic and sound qualities are superb! The delivery man said that he dun do IT stuffs, so he dun install the printers, ok nvm, i set it up myself, and to my surprise the printer did not provide the USB cable, i was like WTF!! i checked the list of tings tat i should have, and true enough, no cables included........

      Growing up watching TV, it gave me the short-sightness i have now, but then wat will life be without TV? I cant imagine, so its a small price to pay.. lol  Before Survivor came out, there's no such ting as reality tv... Or i can say, nothing interesting to watch, lol... I can still remember TV without cable, shows like Growing Up, Comedy Night, Huan Dao Zhui Zhui Zhui and SBC/TCS Drama Series filled my days...  But once Survivor came out during the first season, i was really into Reality Tv Stuffs... And all the reality tv shows start popping out, Amazing Race, Fear Factor, American Idol, Bachelor etc...... I was totally glued to such shows during their first season, but my interest faded away, like Under One Roof, from second season on... Coz everyting seems the same to me, but now there's gonna be Singapore Idol, someting similar, yet different, coz its Singaporeans, so be sure that im catching the show...  Anyway I've just discovered a new reality tv show on MtvSEA Viva La Bam, its about this crazy guy, who always disturbs and teases his parents, in little tings and in big tings.. And i cant believe it when i watched it for the first time just now... This episode, he tried to make his dad become totally pissed-off, but failed, coz surprisingly, his dad took it really well... Haha cant believe such parents existed...   1st plan:  He bought hundreds of iron on pictures of burgers, coz he said that his dad loves eating burgers, and iron the picture on ALL of his dad's shirt and pants..  Reaction:  His dad couldnt care less, put on the shirt and pants as usual although he saw the burger ironed on his shirt and pants.. lol   2nd plan:  He used a jacksaw to cut up a hole in the middle of his bedroom floor, and when his parents asked what was he doing, he said that he wants a fire pole attached from his room to the first level...  Reaction:  His parents couldnt care less either, and let him did the fire pole up, his dad played with the fire pole somemore, loves it too!   3rd plan:  He inserted grounded beef into his dad's toothpaste tube, so when his dad brushes his teeth, beef is squeezed out onto his toothbrush! EEK  Reaction:  It tasted like beef jerky, *rinses his mouth*   4th plan:  He drove his dad's favourite van out, and totally wrecked it.. But he did buy a new vehicle for his dad  Reaction:  Oh my god.. Its my favourite van.... Oh u bought me another vehicle? Thank u son.......   5th plan:  Treated his parents to an vacation out of town, and while they are away, built a skate-park inside the house, YES, INSIDE the house!      Reaction:  (While his son is skateboarding  inside  the house) Way to go son!! *Claps*  Can u believe his parents? If i do someting like cutting one of my parents' favourite shirts, im dead, not to mention ironing pictures on all their shirts.. lol.. Next episode he will try to do someting crazy again, hahaha nice show.... Love it!   Current Mood: TV!!!   Current Music: Ai Cheng - Xiang Ni De Tian Kong

      Boringggggggggggg, its been about a week since my last day of work...... nothing to do, i will feel sian, working, i will feel sian... Im sure its the same for everyone, but thank goodness, had quite a day today..  Went down to the temple at Waterloo Street with my parents tis afternoon, to bai bai.. after that, went down to suntec city to lunch at Crystal Jade (to shelyn: *blink blink* lol), ate until my stomach nearly bursted, shiok-anation! There is tis Tangs sale at suntec city hall 402 today, and so, we went down, my dad and mum went on a shopping-spree, shoes, tupperwares, titbits, etc etc.. but i bought nothing lar... lol  While waiting for my mum to come out of the toilet, there's tis plump guy who is so plump, tat he cant walk, and he was on a wheelchair.. I saw it once and turned away, but the passer-bys kept pointing and looking at the poor guy.. He's already at tis state, cant they be more considerate? Wat if everybody looks and points at them, will they like it? Oh well, singaporeans......  After that, my dad went on a shopping-spree at Courts, bought a Toshiba 29 inch digital TV, a Panasonic Dvd Recorder and an Epson Printer (for me lar, my printer is spoilt, but then paying him back with my incoming pay).. I sympathised with the sales assistant, why? My dad kept bugging him for discounts and free gifts, lol.. He kept saying the price is discounted price already, but my dad just kept going on and on.. Guess wat? The sales assistant said: I will give u a 30dollars Robinsons voucher.. Woh, my dad's stunt worked.. LOL  Saw  urlLink Mel's  band's,  urlLink LGF , gig at the area outside Carrefour.. They started by singing Xiao Xiao's Ai yao tang dan dan.. Nice song, one of my favourites.. Sang a few of their own hits too, nice...     Mel is the drummer   Went home with my parents after the gig, and i was tinking of packing my computer table a bit.... Ended up, i did a mini spring cleaning on my own, and i cant believe tat the room is actually my room when i finished, even my mum was like: So li hai? So fast finish packing liao...., lol, felt so accomplised....       BEFORE (PIG STY)        AFTER (YES, I DID IT!)

      Okie, its not about the British band Blur, but its just about some blur things that i had done, and im willing to share with everyone, dont laugh ok! People tends to be blur at times, lol  Just now, i was watching the tv, tinking tat its late and the volume is too high already.. I tried to turn down the volume of my tv... As i turn down the volume, i was tinking, why no reaction one, and i tried turning up and down to see any difference.. No, no reaction at all.. So i turned my head around to see whether the knob is working... Wait a minute, knob? Shouldnt the volume control of the tv just buttons? And finally, i discovered, im turning the knob of my computer speakers.... Erm ok, u can stop laughing now... ok! lol  A few months back, i was meeting up with my platoon mates for a movie, so everyting set, on liao, when i had reached orchard, i was on Lido side.....  i called them up: where are u guys?   they: We are at HMV...  me: do u guys wan to come down to the cinema to look for me? so i dun need to walk there and back..  they: ok, which cinema are you at?  me: Lido  they: har? Lido? isnt tat in orchard?  me: ya, then how? or u wan to watch at cineleisure?  they: we at HMV  CITYLINK  leh..... DAMN, do u believe it? Somehow, i had mixed up city hall and orchard, this one is the blurest ting i had ever done in all of my 23 years of life... Power rite? lol  The two incidents above are power ones, im adding in a not-so-power one as dessert for u guys... As i was heading home, i sat on the bus and was in deep thoughts.. So i was tinking about a lot of tings, and then when i finally "regain consciousness" I was already like 5 bus-stops away from my destination, lol, i tink tis happened to me like two times...

       Ok, so i took up a maths course call Bridging Maths course a couple of months back to qualify for the entry of my degree course. I called up SIM and asked about my special panel letter, and they referred me to RELC. So i called RELC, and this is the conversation........  me: May i know what kind of additional documents the letter is referring to? relc: Ok nvm, u tell me ur ic number and i check for u After a few seconds, relc: ok, ur maths is not enough to qualify for this course me: oh, but i took bridging maths in SIM relc: oh, then did u state inside the application form me: erm.. no relc: oh tats why lar relc: nvm, u just send us an email with ur particulars and we will check and submit ur application again  So as u can see, the bloody ting is cocked up! Wat the fuck sia! So i immediately send the bloody email and called up my coz adminstrator, and she only knew about tis cocked up when i told her about tis case. And she agreed that the application form did not state clearly, Fucked up.. hope they dun cocked up my email again, or else sure complain until they die!   Current Mood:  Fucked-up

      Just as i finished my prev posting, one of my course-mates smsed me, told me that she just received a letter regarding special admissions panel.. Means she does not automatically satisfy the normal entrance requirements and had to go through this panel.. And i rushed down to open my letter box, and guess what.. me too. damn it.  So now, i have to send in watever rubbish documents i have to support my application. Im feeling damn sad now, my fingers crossing doesnt work at all... Hope the admissions panel will accept me! PLEASE!!   Current Mood: DISAPPOINTED

      Still waiting for the letter of confirmation from UOL, some of my course-mates who applied earlier, got the letter already, still waiting for mine, *fingers crossed*  Oh well, added most of my course-mates in msn, came to know tat some of them got rejected by UOL.. So sad man.. people getting lesser and lesser..  But i cant wait for Uni, after all those shit in NS, i missed schooling a lot, just wan to get back to studying life... Met up with my course-mates a couple of weeks back, had fun crapping with them, cant wait to go to school and crap with them everyday, and release some stress from studies.  School, i cant wait!

      Nothing much today, since my work at GESPS is done, currently still waiting for any schools with trainers quitting or someting.. Hope i will have a new school to teach in soon. Tomolo is the last day of my mobilisation standby, *prays dont tio tomolo* lol  Watched Shi Zhi Lu Kou on channelU just now, got tis lady (Jin someting Yan, dont rem the name) in one group with Jacky. She got small eyes (dan yan pi). And i actually find her really cute....Ok so, if u read one of my prev postings, i've got one on Linda the VJ/Singer, who got small eyes also, from Taiwan. I mentioned that i like girls with small eyes in that posting. Then come to tink of it, of all my frends, only two got small eyes if i never rem wrongly.. And on the streets i seldom see people with small eyes, even as u were browsing the pictures from friendster, where did all the small eyes people go? Lol  Ok, i guess most people in singapore wants big eyes, as big as possible.. I do agree big eyes are nicer.. But then small eyes also got its own personality, my two frens with the small eyes looked cute with their overall appearance, guess they are more suited for small eyes, haha. Oh well, people got to live with their eyes somehow, no matter its big or small, they've got their own character. But some ppl do go for surgery to make their eyes become shuang yan pi.. if shuang yan pi suits you, so be it, wat if it doesnt? There is a certain risk in it too, i guess i dont agree with cosmetic surgery much....  On the other hand, imagine aliens with small eyes, doesnt it look strange? lol   Current Mood: Curious Current Music: Avril Lavigne - Forgotten
