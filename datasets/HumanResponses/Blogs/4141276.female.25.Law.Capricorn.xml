       urlLink    Never fear: the green hats have your back at the RNC.&nbsp; urlLink     Thirteen days until the influx of approximately 50,000 Republican cheerleaders invade our fair city. This Village Voice  article  has nifty tips on what not to do when protesting. To keep yourself out of trouble yet exercise your right to freedom of speech and assembly, make friends with the folks with the green hats. They're a volunteer corps of legal observers. Recruited by the National Lawyers Guild, they're at the ready to record data that would be useful in future civil rights lawsuits.  Pretty curious as to how this will all pan out. I don't know if I could take four days of having such a huge concentration of people all stoked on Dubya and screaming "FOUR MORE!" within a mere three miles of me. I just might club someone. Multiple people. With glee.

       urlLink    The Badasses&nbsp; urlLink     I decided to make last night a Blockbuster night since it's been rainy and all. My roommate was nice enough to let my broke ass use a Blockbuster coupon. Extremely delighted to finally take a break from the mini-depression/I-just-moved-to-the-most-expensive-city-with-a-negative-bank-account-and-no-job freak out that I've been going through, I rented  Ocean's Eleven  and  Dirty Pretty Things  (didn't like so much. I was expecting something more, well, dirty). I love heist movies ... plus it renewed my crush on George Clooney and Brad Pitt. So shoot me. Plus there's nothin like men who wear suits on a casual basis and don't look like either a pimp or a dweeb. That's hot. Refer to Exhibit A up above.  By the middle of the second movie I noticed that I kept scratching my back and my legs. I was so uncomfortable that I had to stop the movie and retire upstairs. I found four huge welts on my legs and three in the small of my back, the result of some rogue mosquito feeding on my apparently tasty blood. I was reminded of my unrealistic hope of joining my man out in Southeast Asia for a month-long vacation.  The mosquitoes would have a feeding frenzy the minute I stepped off the plane and I would be one massive quivering welt before I hit the ground. I'm Pilipina ... don't my genes protect against this kind of thing? My fabulous genes already provide me with a glorious toasty brown tan while all the white people around me on the beach start freckling and looking like small blonde lobsters. Why did my genes fail me now?  I remembered that my mom put some Vicks Vaporub on a mosquito bite that incapacitated my forearm and the swelling came right down. At the time, I thought that it was some shady Filipino witch doctor salve, but it worked so I didn't care. So I marched my ass right down to the 24-hour Rite Aid down the street and bought myself a tub of Vicks Vaporub. At 1.30 a.m. On a Friday night. Today I walked around all day hoping no one would notice that I smelled like Vicks Vaporub.   urlLink    Senator Obama rockin the DNC&nbsp; urlLink     On a completely unrelated note,  this man's  speech at the DNC made my shriveled, cold, cynical heart feel a foreign emotion: a sense of hope for American politics. Barack for 2012!

      My new favorite thing to do is sit out on the balcony. I'm temporarily in Hell's Kitchen, a.k.a. Clinton or Midtown on the westside.    urlLink    Manhattan Skyline&nbsp; urlLink     For 360 degrees, all I see is Manhattan skyline, except for a break in the west where you can see the Hudson river and Jersey beyond.  It kind of looks like this, but you're in the middle of it. See that peaked building on the right, the one that looks like a fat pencil? I live a block from that. Yes, I know. Rockin. Yeah, you should be jealous. It's okay though, because I'm only here temporarily, so you can't hate on me too hard.    urlLink    Radio City Music Hall&nbsp; urlLink     To the east, if you lean out a little bit, you can see the glow of the blue neon sign for Radio City Music Hall.   Lovely, lovely, lovely.

      Unseasonably cool weather here in NYC, i.e., not 90+ degrees and not humid. It's too bad, because I had taken a liking to the sticky heat. Kinda sexy. When the weather is like that, I like to pretend that I'm on a tropical island, even though I'm surrounded by piss-smelling concrete and have to take the subway to touch a tree.  Now that I have all this free time, I get to read for pleasure. I had almost forgotten what that was all about. It took a while for me to look at a book and realize that there aren't any multiple choice drills and practice essays waiting for me. I've been spending hours holed up in the Borders at Columbus Circle, madly reading books I can't afford to buy right now. At the moment, I'm juggling:  The Lovely Bones  by Alice Sebold,  Me Talk Pretty One Day  by David Sedaris and  Kitchen Confidential  by Anthony Bourdain. It's so nice to read texts that have plots and characters and have nothing to do with legal hypotheticals.  Chatted it up with a guy at Borders, a comedy writer who currently has Margaret Cho as one of his clients. I felt the need to drop some "I got a man" references, just in case. Maybe I'll have a new movie/general activities buddy, as long as he doesn't get the wrong idea.   urlLink    Eerie abandoned hospitals and more!&nbsp; urlLink     Curious about secret tunnels and abandoned hospitals in NYC?  urlLink Dark Passage  fulfills your need for all things dark and creepy.

       urlLink    New Jersey View of Gotham&nbsp; urlLink     I visited New Jersey this weekend and connected with an entire branch of my father's side of the family. Most were strangers that I had never met before, so there was a lot of "and you are ... ?" and "we're cousins? second cousins?". We all gathered at Tita Lita's tastefully fabulous house in Morristown and proceeded to gorge ourselves on the spread provided for us in the backyard. (For those who aren't familiar with Filipino words, "Tita" means "Auntie"). Then we retired to the kitchen, where we all somehow managed to descend upon the kitchen counter of unhealthy array of Filipino desserts even in our weakened food coma states.  Having dinner with my dad's cousins and their families only reinforced my knowledge of where I inherited my tendency to yell things excitedly and throw my head back when I laugh. It also made me feel less alone out here. I grew up in a family that used every excuse that it could to get together. ("Hey, it's the third Saturday of July. Let's go to Tita Chelle's/Tita Jane's house!") We would clog up the street in front of the house with our Toyotas, file into the living room and swallow down pancit and adobo until we were delirious enough to succumb to the inevitable turns at the karaoke machine.  Even though my family hasn't done that on a regular basis in a long time, it was hard knowing that I didn't have the opportunity for that here. I tried to find consolation in the idea that Manhattan is a city full of other lone wolves crazy enough to make the big move regardless of the loneliness and the bloated credit card bills. Small wonder that that thought just wasn't enough when you got homesick. Last night changed that somewhat. Now I know that I have whole families of cousins just a forty-minute train ride away in Jersey. Nothing will ever replace the family that I have out west, but it's nice to know that I also have family that I can get to know here.

      It's amazing how much time job-hunting can take. I spent four or five hours this morning going to different websites, looking at everything from MTV legal internships to corporate firm listings. I wish I could hire myself as my own head hunter.  On my way to a meeting at a temp agency, I was standing in the street waiting for the light to change when I heard a loud wet "plop" and felt a little spatter on my ankle. Looked down. Nope. No spatter on the pink heels. No green glob on the shirt. Phew! Looked up. Eleven (I counted) birds perched atop a street lamp, with me standing right under them. I moved forward, stepping out further into the street to avoid future bombings. A fresh green gob of bird shit on my shoulder on my way to a meeting? Not cute.   urlLink    At Tao, you get to have a 16-foot Buddha loom over while you consume Asian fusion dishes.&nbsp; urlLink     After that, I rushed over to Tao, a formerly hip restaurant turned tourist trap. Probably because it was showcased on Sex and the City. It's that episode where Samantha had a girlfriend for a second and they all went to that red-hued restaurant with a big ass buddha up against a wall. I wanted to fill out an app to moonlight as a hostess. I was fifteen minutes too late, but the hostess on duty at the time gave me a resounding "come back on Monday!" Aw. Goddam you. I was already there.  Spent an embarrassing amount of time  urlLink here . Beware. It's addicting.

       urlLink    Meet the blogger&nbsp; urlLink     Ah, the thrill of voyeurism. I'm biting off of my counsin Janelle and my sister's boyfriend Brent by starting this thing. This recent blog fest sounds like a good idea. It'll keep people connected and such, especially since I have just recently moved from California to New York City. Now people can sneak peeks into my own silly, whirlwind life.  My nomadic life began as a Navy brat. Surprise, surprise. When the military decided to relocate our family to Saudi Arabia, my dad said peace out and retired. That brought us to Southern California. Our family took a little tour of Los Angeles and Orange County before settling in the sleepy bedroom community that is Camarillo (Ventura County). I left for college in the Bay Area, and that was that.  I ended up going to law school in the Bay Area as well, so I had been there for about seven years or so before moving here to NYC.  I had never been east of Las Vegas until last August, when I attended the wedding of one of most beloved friends, Nakia, in Long Island. I decided to make a trip out of it, staying a week to check things out. When I saw the East Village, that's when I decided that I had to move to NYC. Absolutely had to. As soon as I touched down in San Francisco after my trip out here, I was on the phone, trying to arrange it so I can work as a full-time extern with a federal judge out in NYC rather than in San Francisco, as was the original plan.  I got an externship and came out to NYC with two extremely large (dubbed "killer whales" by my sis) duffel bags. Then I left for San Francisco again in May so I could study for the NY Bar because I couldn't concentrate and study out here. Now I'm back in NYC for good.  The downside of coming to NYC? Having to build up an entire professional and social network from the ground up. Fast. I have to find a job. I spent all day today popping my head in the local restaurants and asking if they have any waitressing positions available. It's strange doing that when I just received my Juris Doctorate two months ago. But, you know. Whatever pays the bills. For now.
