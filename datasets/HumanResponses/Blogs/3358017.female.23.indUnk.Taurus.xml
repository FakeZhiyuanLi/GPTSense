      I have been blessed by having good friends who have been there for me.  I would hate to think what I would be doing if it weren't for the good people in my life. Happiness fills my heart when I'm with my friends. The company reminds me to continue down on the goals that I want to achieve and encourage me to keep going whenever I have fallen. The group that would help me when I would come to a dead end.   Did you ever notice how much a person's life changes when you pay them a compliment? It's the small things that make their day better.  It's also a good way to forget past faults and errs. Did you ever hurt someone in the past and wish you could have done anything to take it back? I'm sure we've all put our foots in our mouths sometimes. Mending fences is sometimes hard to do. To keep in contact with people is even more difficult when you lose common ground.  Friendship is a two way street and it can be lost if you take the wrong road or don't pay attention to the signs of when your losing it. However it can be salvaged. My mom called some friendships a patchwork quilt. Like a blanket, friendship could be a nurturer to some, and comforting.  The blanket (meaning the friendship) may be well worn or it could be brand new, or so badly abused that it has a few holes in it, however if your take out the bad parts and mend it together, you would have a quilt where all of the memories are positive and the bad ones are forgotten. Today I am going to make my own patchwork quilt of friendship and remember all the good memories that I have with my friends and take time to thank them personally for being a good friend.

      Where the road would take you? How far you would have to go to reach that destination? Did you ever go somewhere without thinking about where the path would take you? And what it would lead you to?   This is what my life has felt to me for a while. I've come to a place where I am in a direction that I don't want to be in, but I've put in so much effort into what I have accomplished that I feel that it is necessary for me to keep going so that I can achieve more in my life. Work has been difficult, I have always chosen the harder path when it came to it. Spending extra time at places when I didn't have to, making sure that everything was just right, so that I could reap the rewards. But the rewards aren't coming.   So I am in a transitional stage with work right now, that's okay. I want to get out of my job. It doesn't pay me enough to make it beneficial. I never knew that I could put myself down into such low degrading work, and something that made me feel I have so much more potential. There are so many other things that I want to achieve.  Did you ever go back in your life and regret certain things that happened in the past? Like if only I did this, then maybe....   Someone would be around today  I would have an ideal job with a better education  I would support myself with a good income  I would do something I love.  I would look better and take care of my health.  But then we are told that certain things were meant to happen so that we would learn from the experience. However, we can change what is happening in our lives at any time that we want to. So what's holding me back from doing what I want to do? Life itself.   Wouldn't it be great if we could change out of our crummy jobs?
